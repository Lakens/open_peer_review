General comments
This is a nice analysis of Snps in tropical dolphins by competent people. The paper presents
valuable information about two species of tropical dolphins. I suggest that the paper be re-write
in some of the sections (Introduction and some M&M sections) in order to make it
understandable for a general audience. Finally and also it is true that GBS is a kind of Rad-seq
analysis in its base, it should not be mentioned as one, in order to not confound people not
commonly habituate with this kind of analysis. So I recommend just to talk about GBS in your
case and take out any Rad-Seq word.
Introduction:
The introduction is very specific for people working with dolphins; notwithstanding the authors
have a beautiful opportunity to test oceanic biogeography hypotheses. They just mentioned two
of them and both are basically based on dolphins and both were lightly mentioned.
Also, in order to establish the different working hypotheses, the authors should discuss more
about them. For example, the first hypothesis is mentioned without any previous background as
how the Panama Isthmus in conjunction with the isolation from central and western Pacific
unsuitable habitat generate ETP subspecies, why is not just one or the other? Probably there are
really good reasons for the authors to hypothesized this, however they should go deep in order to
understand where both hypotheses came from and for both species. The same thing with the
second hypothesis, why one subspecies should be more related to one than to another? The
authors didn’t mention where this hypothesis came from, or if it just a hypothesis based on
geographic distance between the different subspecies? Finally the third hypothesis about the S.
attenuata, basically mentioned the same as Escorza-Triviño et al. 2005, but with a bigger number
of sampled populations, but they didn’t mention what Escorza-Triviño et al. found and why the
authors think there are just two lineages (probably they have reasons, but they should expose it at
the paper).
Based on the previous, it seems that the authors have very clear in their mind the different
subspecies/ecotypes/populations for both species, however it is very confuse for someone out of
the dolphins area. Thus the authors should try to summarize more clearly all the subspecies for
both species, geographic ranges and data available, in order to test the proposed hypotheses. One
possibility could be the use the figures 1 and 2 with the boundaries of the subspecies and
including the possible geographic/oceanographic barriers that led the authors to proposed theses
hypotheses.
Finally, the authors should take care about the use of two terms that although tend to be
overlapped in some issues, they are not the same and are commonly misused in the literature:
Phylogeography and Population structure.
Material and Methods
The M&M are well described. Probably the authors should mention some minor details in order
to not make the readers look for the other papers, for example: which sequencing platform and
kit did the authors used?

Results
Very clear, although the authors should mentioned the values in the text and not just in the tables
(e.g. heterozigosity).

Nice discussion of each of the populations for both species.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This study uses RADseq genome sampling to compare population for two Stenella species with
similar distributional ranges. Sample sizes for most of the geographic range included are too
small for strong inference. However the comparisons in the ETP are very useful and interesting.
4
At the same time, as the authors point out, those data (using the same plus additional markers)
have already been published. The authors should justify why it’s useful to present these data
again here. I’m not sure that the inclusion of the 3-9 samples/ population from the rest of the
world justifies that very well, though some results are useful if preliminary. The authors also cite
a paper in review, and this one includes some of the worldwide populations as well as the ETP,
but is based on mitogenomes. Some additional comments follow, and note that there are typos
throughout that I haven’t marked.
Lines 80-88 - representation of Andrews et al. (2013) isn’t quite right. Although Andrews et al. do
make a point about ‘porous’ boundaries based on their comparison of morphotypes in the ETP, it
is not true that the ‘only sign of population genetic structure’ they found was based on a Y-
chromosome marker. They also sequenced a nuclear intron (Actin locus) and mtDNA loci and
found genetic structure among ETP, Central America, Hawaii, Moorea, Samoa and the dwarf
form. Earlier they had reported substructure around the Hawaiian Islands based on
microsatellite DNA markers. So they reported some of the same substructure reported in this
study, but not among the ETP putative subspecies. However, their nuclear DNA comparison was
at just one locus, and so the resolution was relatively low.
Lines 94-96 – what’s the basis for this hypothesis?
Lines 121-130 – type assigned based on the ‘majority in the school’ and not on the morphology of
the sampled individual, and the reasons are explained, but how might this affect the accuracy of
the comparisons, given that they often swim in mixed groups? How accurate was the assessment
of the type of the majority of the school?
Lines 190-191 – don’t get this – why not confirm topology with a selection of multiple random
pairs? Also, why not use a method that allows partitioning e.g. for GC content – known to make a
difference in topology with similar datasets?
Lines 232-233 – sample sizes make comparisons between most populations for heterozygosity
impossible… This is also the case for Fst, which depends on an accurate estimate of allele
frequency. Although aided somewhat by having a large number of loci, Fst still provides poor
inference when the sample size is 3-9 (as it is for 10 of the population samples here).
Lines 285-289 – alpha calculation really is most appropriate here – n/3 is ‘one size fits all’ and can
often lead to over-fitting.
Lines 321-323… - unrouted trees don’t really provide much more information than the
ordination analyses shown, and nothing about the timing and pattern of phylogeographic
processes. The authors could have used read data to construct phylogenies by more conventional
means and included outgroups. There are issues with interpretation, but these can be addressed
to some extent.
The discussion starts by addressing questions about worldwide biogeography, but this is not a
strength for this study, given the very limited sample set. Better to focus on the core study area,
and mention the rest more briefly together with caveats about interpretation (though this would
also need to be in the context of what has been published already).
Lines 402-403 – yes, but this is the case for all of the comparisons involving such small sample
sizes.
Line 569 – Australian dwarf population is said to have ‘much reduced diversity’, but variance is
5
large for these estimates and sample sizes small – is the difference significant? Prior to
speculation about why diversity may be low, this should be tested.
Lines 582-594 – conjecture about Wallace line is interesting, but speculative given the very small
sample sizes and consequent difficulty estimating an accurate Fst value.
Lines 635-639 – really can’t make much of the magnitude of these point Fst estimates, given the
broad uncertainties associated with Fst estimation from such small sample sizes.
Lines 634-660 – while the authors shy away from ‘strong conclusions’ when the sample size is
N=1, they do draw conclusions based on comparisons of very small sample sizes, with some
caveats. In general here and throughout the discussion the text is long, and I think too detailed
and thorough for the data available. There are some interesting preliminary suggestions, but
they should be treated as preliminary, and much more concisely. There is also a fair bit of
consideration of consistency with geologic/ biogeographic time points, when no estimates have
been made about the timing or pattern of divisions based on the genetic data.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The authors address the question of small sample sizes by citing Willing et al (2012). Willing et
al. use simulations to assess the impact of small sample size on Fst for various number of loci, and
having a larger number of loci does help (as mentioned in my review), assuming that biases per
locus will be random. The problem for a given locus is that Fst depends on allele frequency
estimation, and this is imprecise when sample sizes are small. Small samples drawn from a
larger population also distort allele frequencies, and this depends on the relative proportion of
alleles. As is common for simulations, Willing et al. make some simplifying assumptions to
facilitate the analysis. In their simulation, allele frequencies are distributed evenly among 8
classes (0.1, 0.2…0.9), sex ratios are equal and there is no recombination. They also assume an
island model – that is, equal population sizes and full equal connectivity. In the real world these
factors will be distorted in various ways, perhaps most importantly by sampling effects. As
Willing et al. point out: “Theoretically, precise estimates of genetic differentiation can be obtained
based on very small sample sizes of random individuals. However, in practice, random sampling
cannot always be achieved in nature. Estimates on extremely small samples, as suggested here,
might be severely affected by non-random sampling, e.g. due to population structuring.” Both
linkage disequilibrium and selection could also affect Fst strongly when sample sizes are small.
However, I don’t mean to imply that this is a fatal problem with respect to Fst, but just that the
authors should acknowledge the limitations, rather than ignore them, or worse, cite a paper to
suggest that all is fine. Note that heterozygosity (Table 2) is a separate issue, hard to accurately
assess when population sizes are small, and not addressed explicitly by Willing et al. (2012).
With respect to the mitogenome paper, yes the only other distant region is Hawaii, however the
point remains that because of these two other studies assessing the ETP region in considerable
detail, the novelty of the current manuscript is restricted to small samples from elsewhere in the
world.
The authors confirm my point about their un-rooted trees providing inference that is comparable
to the ordination analyses, and I don’t dispute that there are clear indications of differentiation
among some of these populations. However, inference drawn about biogeographic process
would need to be based on phylogenetic reconstructions that could infer a sequence of events –
something the un-rooted trees and ordination plots can’t do. The authors explain clearly why
they don’t want to include rooted trees, which is OK, but this then limits their possible inference
to what can be interpreted from a static pattern of differentiation among regions. Some of the
discussion still seems to stretch that limited inference a bit too far.
Other points have been satisfactorily addressed.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors address the question of small sample sizes by citing Willing et al (2012). Willing et
al. use simulations to assess the impact of small sample size on Fst for various number of loci, and
having a larger number of loci does help (as mentioned in my review), assuming that biases per
locus will be random. The problem for a given locus is that Fst depends on allele frequency
estimation, and this is imprecise when sample sizes are small. Small samples drawn from a
larger population also distort allele frequencies, and this depends on the relative proportion of
alleles. As is common for simulations, Willing et al. make some simplifying assumptions to
facilitate the analysis. In their simulation, allele frequencies are distributed evenly among 8
classes (0.1, 0.2…0.9), sex ratios are equal and there is no recombination. They also assume an
island model – that is, equal population sizes and full equal connectivity. In the real world these
factors will be distorted in various ways, perhaps most importantly by sampling effects. As
Willing et al. point out: “Theoretically, precise estimates of genetic differentiation can be obtained
based on very small sample sizes of random individuals. However, in practice, random sampling
cannot always be achieved in nature. Estimates on extremely small samples, as suggested here,
might be severely affected by non-random sampling, e.g. due to population structuring.” Both
linkage disequilibrium and selection could also affect Fst strongly when sample sizes are small.
However, I don’t mean to imply that this is a fatal problem with respect to Fst, but just that the
authors should acknowledge the limitations, rather than ignore them, or worse, cite a paper to
suggest that all is fine. Note that heterozygosity (Table 2) is a separate issue, hard to accurately
assess when population sizes are small, and not addressed explicitly by Willing et al. (2012).

With respect to the mitogenome paper, yes the only other distant region is Hawaii, however the
point remains that because of these two other studies assessing the ETP region in considerable
detail, the novelty of the current manuscript is restricted to small samples from elsewhere in the
world.
The authors confirm my point about their un-rooted trees providing inference that is comparable
to the ordination analyses, and I don’t dispute that there are clear indications of differentiation
among some of these populations. However, inference drawn about biogeographic process
would need to be based on phylogenetic reconstructions that could infer a sequence of events –
something the un-rooted trees and ordination plots can’t do. The authors explain clearly why
they don’t want to include rooted trees, which is OK, but this then limits their possible inference
to what can be interpreted from a static pattern of differentiation among regions. Some of the
discussion still seems to stretch that limited inference a bit too far.
Other points have been satisfactorily addressed.

Associate Editor's comments (Professor Michael Bruford):
Associate Editor: 1
Comments to the Author:
Two reviewers have examined your MS and find the results useful. However,
both make significant suggestions for how this paper may become acceptable for
publication. Reviewer 2's comment about the overall novelty and relationship
between this dataset and one already published and another in review concern
me somewhat, and need to be fully addressed in your revision.
>> Response: The data set already published (Leslie and Morin 2016) focuses
only on the ETP and Hawaii, and doesn’t include any samples from outside these
areas. Therefore, it doesn’t include any global context. Moreover, it doesn’t
include any phylogeographic analyses. The paper that is in review (Leslie et al In
Reivew) is an entirely different dataset (mitochondrial genomes), and also
doesn’t include any samples from outside the ETP and Hawaii. I’m not sure how
Reviewer 2 came to the conclusion that that study included global samples, but
that is incorrect. In several areas – mainly the introduction – we have added
remarks about how these studies differ to provide clarity for the reader.

Comments to the Author(s)
General comments
This is a nice analysis of Snps in tropical dolphins by competent people. The
paper presents valuable information about two species of tropical dolphins. I
suggest that the paper be re-write in some of the sections (Introduction and some
M&M sections) in order to make it understandable for a general audience.
>> Response: The introduction has been broadened for a more general
readership. Moreover, some confusing sections of the methods have been
rewritten to increase clarity – this is particularly true for the paragraphs outlining
the existing knowledge of population structure and taxonomy, as well as how
samples were assigned to subspecies in the eastern tropical Pacific.
Finally and also it is true that GBS is a kind of Rad-seq analysis in its base, it
should not be mentioned as one, in order to not confound people not commonly
habituate with this kind of analysis. So I recommend just to talk about GBS in
your case and take out any Rad-Seq word.
>> Response: All mention of Rad-Seq has been removed and replaced with
GBS.
Introduction:
The introduction is very specific for people working with dolphins; notwithstanding
the authors have a beautiful opportunity to test oceanic biogeography
hypotheses. They just mentioned two of them and both are basically based on
dolphins and both were lightly mentioned.
>> Response: The introduction has been filled out to include other hypotheses
from other marine species that share similar distributions.
1. Also, in order to establish the different working hypotheses, the authors should
discuss more about them. For example, the first hypothesis is mentioned without
any previous background as how the Panama Isthmus in conjunction with the
isolation from central and western Pacific unsuitable habitat generate ETP
subspecies, why is not just one or the other? Probably there are really good
reasons for the authors to hypothesized this, however they should go deep in
order to understand where both hypotheses came from and for both species. The
same thing with the second hypothesis, why one subspecies should be more
related to one than to another? The authors didn’t mention where this hypothesis
came from, or if it just a hypothesis based on geographic distance between the
different subspecies? Finally the third hypothesis about the S. attenuata,
basically mentioned the same as Escorza-Triviño et al. 2005, but with a bigger
number of sampled populations, but they didn’t mention what Escorza-Triviño et
al. found and why the authors think there are just two lineages (probably they
have reasons, but they should expose it at the paper).
>> Response: This section – specifically the hypotheses – has been fleshed out
more. Again, as the ETP is not the central focus of this study (and is covered
extensively in other manuscripts), we have tried to restrict the depth with which
we cover background information on the ETP. With that said, the reviewer is
correct in that we left out a lot of details that have been included in this revision.
Based on the previous, it seems that the authors have very clear in their mind the
different subspecies/ecotypes/populations for both species, however it is very
confuse for someone out of the dolphins area. Thus the authors should try to
summarize more clearly all the subspecies for both species, geographic ranges
and data available, in order to test the proposed hypotheses.
>> Response: We have made significant adjustments to this section of text
including splitting the two species out to talk about each one’s taxonomy
independently. In addition, we have restructured the whole introduction, which we
hope will help provides clarity for the reader.
One possibility could be the use the figures 1 and 2 with the boundaries of the
subspecies and including the possible geographic/oceanographic barriers that
led the authors to proposed theses hypotheses.
>> Response: The figures have been edited to reflect the hypothesized
boundaries discussed in the text and tested in this manuscript. This should add
to the clarify of the overall manuscript.
Finally, the authors should take care about the use of two terms that although
tend to be overlapped in some issues, they are not the same and are commonly
misused in the literature: Phylogeography and Population structure.
>> Response: This is a great point and we regret not being more careful. We
have gone through the MS and double-checked mentions of these two phrases
to ensure that they are accurate. We also added population genetic structure to
the title to make it more accurate.
Material and Methods
The M&M are well described. Probably the authors should mention some minor
details in order to not make the readers look for the other papers, for example:
which sequencing platform and kit did the authors used?
>> Response: We added more details on the sequencing platform and chemistry.
We also included the restriction enzyme used to cleave the DNA initially.
Results
Very clear, although the authors should mentioned the values in the text and not
just in the tables (e.g. heterozigosity).
>> Response: heterozygosity values were added to the text
Discussion
Nice discussion of each of the populations for both species.
>> Response: Thank you
Specific comments
L24: take out that first phrase:
>> Response: The first line of the abstract is removed.
L31: Be clear if it is for both species
>> Response: added, “in both species” to the end of the sentence.
L42: What is similar ecologically?
>> Response: Ecologically is the wrong word here. We changed “ecologically” to
“habitat (i.e., pelagic)” to clarify. The ecology (i.e., feeding habits) is actually quite
different in these two species.
L48: Among others
>> Response: added “among others” to the end of this sentence as suggested.
L51: So?
>> Response: We added an additional sentence following this paragraph that
highlights how these putative boundaries would drive structure and decrease
global homogeneity.
L66-78: The paragraph is kind of confusing specially for those not related with
marine mammals
>> Response: This section was restructured to address both species
independently. We hope this adds removes confusion and clarity to the current
state of knowledge for a broader audience.
L117 and others: Try to not use the word STOCK, is a word associated with
fisheries and it is badly use in marine mammals (unless the whaling opens
again), not by these authors but by almost all the marine mammals researchers.
>> Response: The word stock has been changed to population in every
occurrence.
L125-126: This is totally contrary to what the authors were saying about classify
based on morphology… I understood based on Leslie et al. 2016 paper,
otherwise will not be understandable.
>> Response: The last sentence of the previous paragraph was a typo that
should have read, “In areas where the two subspecies overlap, spotted dolphins
were classified based on morphology. This has been clarified.
L294-295: Please re-write this phrase
>> Response: There was a typo in that the word “arm” was inadvertently “are”;
the insertion of this verb made this sentence very confusing. This has been
corrected. In addition, we moved the subject of the sentence to the beginning to
help clarify. Finally, we also added commas to the following sentence to set apart
the location of the next set of populations relative to the position of the ETP
populations.
L723: two times the word design
>> Response: Removed
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
This study uses RADseq genome sampling to compare population for two
Stenella species with similar distributional ranges.
Sample sizes for most of the geographic range included are too small for strong
inference. However the comparisons in the ETP are very useful and
interesting. At the same time, as the authors point out, those data (using the
same plus additional markers) have already been published. The authors should
justify why it’s useful to present these data again here. I’m not sure that the
inclusion of the 3-9 samples/ population from the rest of the world justifies that
very well, though some results are useful if preliminary.
>> Response: We agree that the sample sizes should be larger, but unfortunately
samples from locations outside the ETP are rare, and additional tissues from
these areas are unlikely to be available any time soon. We disagree, however,
that the sample sizes are too small for strong inference. A very useful simulation
study examined the impact of small sample sizes on detecting population genetic
structure when using many makers found otherwise (Willing et al 2012). They
concluded that sample size can be reduced to as low as 4-6 when using a large
number of genetic markers (>1000), such as SNPs, such as in our study. In this
work we have pointed out where our sample sizes are low – especially where
they are below the recommendations of Willing et al (2012).
Based on this comment, however, and likely concerns from readers, we have
added a paragraph in the introduction that highlights the findings of Willing et al
(2012) as the impact our study.
The authors also cite a paper in review, and this one includes some of the
worldwide populations as well as the ETP, but is based on mitogenomes. Some
additional comments follow, and note that there are typos throughout that I
haven’t marked.
>> Response: This is incorrect; the mitogenome population structure paper cited
in this paper as Leslie et al (In Review) IS currently in review in Marine Mammal
Science, but it focuses SOLELY on the ETP and Hawaii. There are no samples
outside of this region included in this study.
Lines 80-88 - representation of Andrews et al. (2013) isn’t quite right. Although
Andrews et al. do make a point about ‘porous’ boundaries based on their
comparison of morphotypes in the ETP, it is not true that the ‘only sign of
population genetic structure’ they found was based on a Y-chromosome
marker. They also sequenced a nuclear intron (Actin locus) and mtDNA loci and
found genetic structure among ETP, Central America, Hawaii, Moorea, Samoa
and the dwarf form. Earlier they had reported substructure around the Hawaiian
Islands based on microsatellite DNA markers. So they reported some of the
same substructure reported in this study, but not among the ETP putative
subspecies. However, their nuclear DNA comparison was at just one locus, and
so the resolution was relatively low.
>> Response: This section has been corrected and additional text has been
added to clarify the results of the Andrews et al 2013 paper.
Lines 94-96 – what’s the basis for this hypothesis?
>> Response: We added a clause to this sentence to include that this hypothesis
is based on the morphological similarity between the two ETP endemic spinner
dolphin subspecies. We also insert Perrin 1990 and Perrin et al 1991 that
reviewed the external morphology and designated the endemic subspecies.
Lines 121-130 – type assigned based on the ‘majority in the school’ and not on
the morphology of the sampled individual, and the reasons are explained, but
how might this affect the accuracy of the comparisons, given that they often swim
in mixed groups?
>> Response: We added a paragraph in the discussion highlighting the possible
impacts of mis-identification. In brief, the inaccuracies would have been restricted
to the ETP, where we have the largest sample sizes; and results from the ETP
analysis are not a focus of this paper, as they have been published elsewhere.
How accurate was the assessment of the type of the majority of the school?
>> Response: The assessment of the type of the majority of the school was
made by the most experienced observers on the research cruise, but there is no
way to measure the accuracy. This limitation was added to the text. Again, given
that the limitations would occur in the ETP, that has the largest sample sizes and
which has already been addressed, we don’t feel concerned about
misassignment.
Lines 190-191 – don’t get this – why not confirm topology with a selection of
multiple random pairs? Also, why not use a method that allows partitioning e.g.
for GC content – known to make a difference in topology with similar datasets?
>> Response: Given the strong evidence of population structure between all
populations (save two pairwise comparisons), clustering of samples by
population in the DAPC analysis, and the extremely computationally intensive
analysis required for SNAPP (requiring weeks to months of computer time), we
don’t believe running additional combinations of samples would be worthwhile.
We are also not aware of the effect of GC content on “similar datasets”. It is our t
Lines 232-233 – sample sizes make comparisons between most populations for
heterozygosity impossible… This is also the case for Fst, which depends on an
accurate estimate of allele frequency. Although aided somewhat by having a
large number of loci, FST still provides poor inference when the sample size is 3-9
(as it is for 10 of the population samples here).
>> Response: See our comments above
Lines 285-289 – alpha calculation really is most appropriate here – n/3 is ‘one
size fits all’ and can often lead to over-fitting.
>> Response: We decided to leave this paragraph in and leave the n/3 in the
supplemental figures, in the case the reader wanted to see the n/3 results.
Lines 321-323… - unrouted trees don’t really provide much more information
than the ordination analyses shown, and nothing about the timing and pattern of
phylogeographic processes. The authors could have used read data to construct
phylogenies by more conventional means and included outgroups. There are
issues with interpretation, but these can be addressed to some extent.
>> Response: The inclusion of unrooted trees was to provide a branching
diagram free of the mid-point root. We feel that this provides the reader with the
clearest (and least biased picture of the relationships resulting from the analysis).
The mid-point rooted tree is provided. If the editor thinks this is redundant, we are
happy to remove it, but we do not feel it detracts at all from the presentation of
the data.
Species-level relationships for delphininae are a mess – they are not at all well
resolved (to the point that some are calling for all to be lumped into a common
genus, Delphinus). Given this, we did not feel comfortable using one species’
data as an outgroup for the other. We asked the developer of SNAPP, if they
thought this was possible, and they strongly cautioned against the use of
outgroups for the methodological reasons outlined in the paper. The reviewer is
correct that there are some issues with interpretation, but we felt it was better to
avoid those issues given the strength with which the SNAPP team felt
outgrouping with possibly distant species was a bad idea. Using the read data
would have been possible, but certainly MUCH more computationally intensive,
and we’re not sure it would have yielded any additional clarity in terms of the
phylogeny. Read data might have given us more information (e.g., TMRCA for
some nodes), but it isn’t clear what the reviewer had in mind, and the SNPs were
computationally tractable and useful for inferring relationships, which was the
goal of this study.
The discussion starts by addressing questions about worldwide biogeography,
but this is not a strength for this study, given the very limited sample set. Better
to focus on the core study area, and mention the rest more briefly together with
caveats about interpretation (though this would also need to be in the context of
what has been published already).
>> Response: See our comments above regarding sample sizes. Also, the core
study area (the ETP) is the subject of Leslie et al (In Review) and Leslie and
Morin 2016.
Lines 402-403 – yes, but this is the case for all of the comparisons involving such
small sample sizes.
>> Response: See our discussion above about sample size. The wording for this
sentence has been changed to reflect that the results including the Tanzania
population comparisons that were non-significant should remain preliminary. We
continue to say the FST results showing connection between Tanzania and the
Maldives were supported by the DAPC and the phylogeny, so we have greater
confidence that there is a biological connection there. However, we highlight that
the Tanzania to Central American connection is probably dubious because it is
not supported by the other two analyses.
Line 569 – Australian dwarf population is said to have ‘much reduced diversity’,
but variance is large for these estimates and sample sizes small – is the
difference significant? Prior to speculation about why diversity may be low, this
should be tested.
>> Response: This is a good point. We tested for a difference with a T-test and
they were not significantly different. Therefore, we have taken out the speculation
about the small population size and the remainder of the paragraph which was
mostly tangential information. This point was also removed from the conclusions.
Lines 582-594 – conjecture about Wallace line is interesting, but speculative
given the very small sample sizes and consequent difficulty estimating an
accurate Fst value.
>> Response: See discussion of small sample sizes above. Please see Willing et
al 2012 regarding the accuracy of Fst values with >1000 SNPs despite low
sample sizes.
Lines 635-639 – really can’t make much of the magnitude of these point Fst
estimates, given the broad uncertainties associated with Fst estimation from such
small sample sizes.
>> Response: See our comments above regarding sample sizes
Lines 634-660 – while the authors shy away from ‘strong conclusions’ when the
sample size is N=1, they do draw conclusions based on comparisons of very
small sample sizes, with some caveats.
>> Response: The wording for this has been changed to lessen the importance
of this finding. See the discussion on sample sizes with Fst above.
In general here and throughout the discussion the text is long, and I think too
detailed and thorough for the data available. There are some interesting
preliminary suggestions, but they should be treated as preliminary, and much
more concisely. There is also a fair bit of consideration of consistency with
geologic/ biogeographic time points, when no estimates have been made about
the timing or pattern of divisions based on the genetic data.
>> Response: We have tried to be more concise throughout, although the first
reviewer asked for more context and explanation of hypotheses. We do not
consider these findings as preliminary, unless discussed as such in the
manuscript. See above for the discussion of the simulation study for the use of
Fst with large SNP data sets. DAPC and phylogenetics are much less sensitive
to low sample sizes. Moreover, increasing samples is not a viable option, as it
will likely take several decades to amass enough samples from these remote
areas to warrant sufficient by most standards of population genetic studies using
mtDNA or microsatellites.

1. The authors address the question of small sample sizes by citing Willing et al (2012). Willing et al. use
simulations to assess the impact of small sample size on Fst for various number of loci, and having a larger
number of loci does help (as mentioned in my review), assuming that biases per locus will be random. The
problem for a given locus is that Fst depends on allele frequency estimation, and this is imprecise when
sample sizes are small. Small samples drawn from a larger population also distort allele frequencies, and
this depends on the relative proportion of alleles. As is common for simulations, Willing et al. make some
simplifying assumptions to facilitate the analysis. In their simulation, allele frequencies are distributed evenly
among 8 classes (0.1, 0.2…0.9), sex ratios are equal and there is no recombination. They also assume an
island model – that is, equal population sizes and full equal connectivity. In the real world these factors will
be distorted in various ways, perhaps most importantly by sampling effects. As Willing et al. point out:
“Theoretically, precise estimates of genetic differentiation can be obtained based on very small sample sizes
of random individuals. However, in practice, random sampling cannot always be achieved in nature.
Estimates on extremely small samples, as suggested here, might be severely affected by non-random
sampling, e.g. due to population structuring.” Both linkage disequilibrium and selection could also affect Fst
strongly when sample sizes are small. However, I don’t mean to imply that this is a fatal problem with
respect to Fst, but just that the authors should acknowledge the limitations, rather than ignore them, or
worse, cite a paper to suggest that all is fine. Note that heterozygosity (Table 2) is a separate issue, hard to
accurately assess when population sizes are small, and not addressed explicitly by Willing et al. (2012).
>Response: We have included additional statements in the introduction regarding the limitations of this
approach and that our sample set possibly violates some of these assumptions of Willing et al (2012) as
they relate to small sample sizes.
2. With respect to the mitogenome paper, yes the only other distant region is Hawaii, however the point
remains that because of these two other studies assessing the ETP region in considerable detail, the novelty
of the current manuscript is restricted to small samples from elsewhere in the world.
>Response: We have added clarification in the final paragraph of the introduction explaining that this is an
expansion of the sampling of the recent studies (Leslie and Moring 2016; Leslie et al In Review) and uses a
novel data set to test global hypotheses in these two species.
3. The authors confirm my point about their un-rooted trees providing inference that is comparable to the
ordination analyses, and I don’t dispute that there are clear indications of differentiation among some of
these populations. However, inference drawn about biogeographic process would need to be based on
phylogenetic reconstructions that could infer a sequence of events – something the un-rooted trees and
ordination plots can’t do. The authors explain clearly why they don’t want to include rooted trees, which is
OK, but this then limits their possible inference to what can be interpreted from a static pattern of
differentiation among regions. Some of the discussion still seems to stretch that limited inference a bit too
far.
>Response: This is a very good point. We have gone back through the discussion and tried to limit the
inference of phylogeographic processes we discuss. Instead of discussing processes, we talk about
relationships and barriers. Moreover, if we discuss how the patterns observed related to biogeographic
hypotheses, we include a caveat that the unrooted analysis does not allow us to infer a progression of
events, but rather a pattern of relationships.
Other points have been satisfactorily addressed.
