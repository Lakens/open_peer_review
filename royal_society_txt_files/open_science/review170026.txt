This study is an important attempt to find the effects of wild and domestic prey on livestock
depredation by snow leopards. We applaud the authors’ effort of collecting data on such a rare
and elusive predator from the challenging mountainous terrain.
The paper asks whether an increase in ungulate prey density would reduce or increase the
number of livestock killed by large carnivores. First, the paper is only about snow leopards and
the generalization to large carnivores is a bit premature. This still needs to be addressed better in
the text. Second, the paper does not estimate the numbers of livestock individuals killed, but
quantifies the prey (domestic and wild) percentage in the diet. This percentage, i.e. the frequency
3
of prey occurrence in scats, is an outdated and heavily biased metric. One reviewer correctly
noted that this percentage overestimates the share of small prey, and the authors replied that
rodents made only < 2% (rebuttal) or < 4% (paper) of the diet. We should add that this percentage
also underestimates large prey, which is relevant for this paper. I would highly recommend
applying the linear (Ackerman et al. 1984; Marker et al. 2003) or non-linear (Wachter et al. 2012;
Chakrabarti et al. 2016) biomass models to estimate biomass and numbers of wild prey and
livestock consumed in the sampled seven sites.
We acknowledge that the collection of snow leopard and prey data from different sites is very
difficult and time-consuming, but the authors should admit that their sample is biased towards
five sites located close to each other in Himanchal Pradesh, with one site from each of Jammu and
Kashmir and Gobi. We would recommend the extrapolation and discussion of data in a local
context and not as a general recommendation for snow leopard conservation throughout its
range.
Considering a high variation of wild and domestic prey densities across the sites, apart from
precision (CI, SE) it is essential also to estimate the accuracy of the linear model in Fig. 2. It can be
done by calculating the root-mean-square deviation (RMSE).
The main logic of this paper is the following: more prey leads to more snow leopards, more snow
leopards kill more livestock, and killing more livestock occurs in places with more livestock. So it
means that the areas with more prey also contain more livestock. How is it possible, taking into
account that livestock generally outcompetes wild prey, particularly in Central Asia? Much more
attention should be paid to discussing the wild prey-livestock interactions in sampled sites.
The authors write about “apparent mutualism” and refer to Fig. 1, but this term is not present
there. You should add apparent mutualism to apparent competition and apparent facilitation.

rohistological diet analysis is known to over-represent of small prey such as rodents. However,
ur study, the contribution of small prey was less than 2%. Our results are comparable to a
dy using molecular genetics conducted earlier in one of our study sites (eg. Shehzad et al
2). We only used the scat samples that were positive with snow leopard specific primer in the
etic analysis. Hence we believe micro-histological analysis of diet is suitable for our study. See

mments to the Author(s)
s study is an important attempt to find the effects of wild and domestic prey on livestock
redation by snow leopards. We applaud the authors’ effort of collecting data on such a
e and elusive predator from the challenging mountainous terrain.
thank the reviewer for appreciation of our efforts and very valuable feedback on the
nuscript.
e paper asks whether an increase in ungulate prey density would reduce or increase the
mber of livestock killed by large carnivores. First, the paper is only about snow leopards
the generalization to large carnivores is a bit premature. This still needs to be
ressed better in the text.
agree that our findings may not be generalisable to other large carnivores. We have
ordingly changed this in some of the sentences in the abstract (line 69-70). However, some of
findings may have implications for other large carnivore conservation and hence we have
ined the word carnivore (instead of more specific snow leopard) in two sentences of the
cussion: Lines 337 and 340.
cond, the paper does not estimate the numbers of livestock individuals killed, but
antifies the prey (domestic and wild) percentage in the diet. This percentage, i.e. the
quency of prey occurrence in scats, is an outdated and heavily biased metric. One
iewer correctly noted that this percentage overestimates the share of small prey, and the
hors replied that rodents made only < 2% (rebuttal) or < 4% (paper) of the diet. We
uld add that this percentage also underestimates large prey, which is relevant for this
er. I would highly recommend applying the linear (Ackerman et al. 1984; Marker et al.
3) or non-linear (Wachter et al. 2012; Chakrabarti et al. 2016) biomass models to estimate
mass and numbers of wild prey and livestock consumed in the sampled seven sites.
suggested, we have re-run our analysis with linear biomass models (Ackerman et al 1984). The
ults were identical (m = 1.14; se = 0.06). Therefore, in our paper we have added a comment to
effect and have noted both results. However, in all subsequent analyses we have retained our
inal analysis with frequency of occurrence. Both approaches bring their own assumptions, and
feel for this dataset, where virtually all prey are large (over 33kg), frequency of occurrence is
re parsimonious.
es 187-192: “We estimated the biomass of each species consumed using the Ackerman's linear
mass model (Ackerman et al 1984). The functional response modelling was conducted with
h, frequency of occurrence and biomass. The results were identical and hence we only present
frequency of occurrence, which is a more parsimonious measure.”
acknowledge that the collection of snow leopard and prey data from different sites is
y difficult and time-consuming, but the authors should admit that their sample is biased
ards five sites located close to each other in Himanchal Pradesh, with one site from
h of Jammu and Kashmir and Gobi. We would recommend the extrapolation and
cussion of data in a local context and not as a general recommendation for snow leopard
servation throughout its range.
agree that a substantial part of our data come from five sites that were relatively close to one
ther. However, we these five sites were different from each other, and also represented a
dient. Two sites had only ibex as the wild prey species, two had only blue sheep and one had
h. Together, our seven sites had three of the four main mountain ungulate prey species known
m across their distribution range (Lyngdoh et al 2014). We agree that our findings may not be
eralizable to large carnivores, and have addressed this as explained above.
nsidering a high variation of wild and domestic prey densities across the sites, apart

. 2. It can be done by calculating the root-mean-square deviation (RMSE).
nk you. We have included in Line 250: “The model fit was good with a high r-square (RMSE =
2
8; R = 0.82).”
e main logic of this paper is the following: more prey leads to more snow leopards, more
w leopards kill more livestock, and killing more livestock occurs in places with more
stock. So it means that the areas with more prey also contain more livestock. How is it
ssible, taking into account that livestock generally outcompetes wild prey, particularly in
ntral Asia? Much more attention should be paid to discussing the wild prey-livestock
eractions in sampled sites.
ppears that the numbers of livestock and wild prey a landscape could sustain is dependent on
productivity. We have further discussed this in Lines 353-357:
r model predicts highest livestock predation by snow leopards in areas with high density of
stock as well as wild prey. While livestock at high density can out-compete wild prey in these
ions [53], it appears that these two groups can also co-exist at relatively high density in areas of
her plant productivity. One such site was Kibber which had the second highest density of
stock as well as wild prey (appendix A, table S2).
e authors write about “apparent mutualism” and refer to Fig. 1, but this term is not
sent there. You should add apparent mutualism to apparent competition and apparent
ilitation.
be consistent we have changed the term apparent mutualism to apparent facilitation throughout
