Review of: Dunn et al. Early-life begging effort…
Review by: Dan Blumstein
This is a mischievously difficult, but I think very important paper. The overall question is
straightforward and important: what are the consequences of early-life foraging experience on
later life metabolic and behavioral decisions. Here, the authors show how the consequences of
early-life begging effort is detectable 2 years on in starlings housed both socially and in smaller
cages. It’s mischievous because the idea is elegant but the methods required to show this were
rather complex. I’m still not 100% certain I understand the cyclic ratio task but I think I do
enough to believe it is a valid measure of defense of energy and I really like the contrast between
defense of energy and fat storage.
The methods are generally clear. While I have no real issue with using the dredge function in
MuMIn…some may. I think that it’s defensible here and I think that the methods are wonderfully
described. I am a bit unclear as to how the correlation between the Staddon slope and the trial
latency against ratio requirement is meaningful (but I do see why the Staddon slope incorporates
a ratio correlation problem. Why not just use the other method?
I applaud the authors for pointing out both congruencies and discrepancies with prior
data/analyses. Ultimately, these results provide new evidence for the myriad of ways that early
life experiences can influence later mass and foraging behavior. It’s gotten me thinking about the
consequences of this for analyses of compensatory growth and it integrates avian, mammalian
and human phenomena nicely.
Minor stuff:
4/5/2016 means something different if you’re in the US. I suggest you write 4 May 2016 to be
unambiguous.
Table 2: Housing Cage table is off.
Might also consider turning variables like HousingCage to Housing—Cage…or something to
reflect it’s a level of a category.

In this manuscript, Dunn et al. have done an ingenious experiment to determine how conditions
during nestling development affect how to storage and intake food when adults. Specifically, in a
hand-reared starling cohort, they manipulated during ten days in nestling development, the
amount of food and the effort to get it. Their results suggest that the nestlings who had to fight
the most to get food, were those who maintained had lighter body when they were adults, but it
was also those who defended more their rate of food intake when food was harder to get. On the
other hand, nestlings that received more food during the experimental manipulation were those
able to get food faster when adults, even when it was costly to obtain. Their results are relevant to
understand differences in body size and foraging behaviour among individuals sharing the same
environment.
The manuscript is very well written, clear and concise. The methodology was also correct. The
authors paid special attention in the design of the experiment and in how to obtain the data
needed for the article. As far I can evaluate, statistical analyses are also correct. My thoughts on
this manuscript have been positive during most part review, however, I found an important
problem that keeps these thoughts from being so positive at the end. Unluckily, there was a bias
in the distribution of sexes into the experimental groups (see below). I hope authors can add
additional information about it, and moreover that they can discard and discuss any confounding
effect on these results.
Authors have tried to control any confounding factor that could potentially influence on their
results, such as natal nest origin or initial weight differences, by assigning siblings to different
experimental nestling groups and by matching nestling by body size. That is totally correct, and
by chance it would be expected that any other differences among siblings, for example nestling
sexes, would be randomly distributed among the experimental groups. Namely, we would expect
4 males and 4 females in each of the four experimental groups. However, despite nestlings were
genetically sexed, this information was not used (or it was not available) when the nestling
assignations were done, and unluckily, that it was not the case. According to the information in
one of the data files (individuals.csv) one of the experimental groups (Lean Easy) was composed
of only males (7males, 0 females), while another group (Plenty Hard) has 1 male and 7 females.
The other groups have a similar number of females and males (Lean Hard: 3 males and 4 females,
Plenty Easy: 4 males and 4 females). That is important, as most of the results of this article are
based on comparisons between the Easy group (11 males and 4 females) and the Hard group (4
males and 11 females) groups, which differ significantly in number of males and females.
The control during the statistical analysis of the sex of the animals is important, since the body
condition is clearly influenced by nestling sex (i.e. males consistently showed a better condition
than females), and in the case of foraging patterns, differences between males and females could
also be plausible.
4
Despite most of the males belonged to the Easy group, and most of the females were 'Plenty', I
could understand and support that the inclusion of the nestling sex into the analyses could to
control differences between males and females. However, in my opinion, the bias in the
distribution of sexes in the experimental groups prevented the inclusion of any interaction terms
between sex and other factors included in the analyses. This is crucial, since it would allow either
to rule out any confounding effect of sex on the results from non-significant interactions between
sex, Effort and Amount. On the other hand, interaction terms would allow to detect differences in
the effect of the experiment between males and females, in that case, any significance of the Effort
and Amount factors should be carefully examined.
With all this in mind, I am not totally convinced about the validity of the results and conclusions
reached in this manuscript. In my opinion, I think it would be important that, in addition to
including in the text the information about the bias in the distribution of sexes in the different
groups, authors discuss in detail any implication of this bias, and if possible, discard any effect of
this bias on the results shown in the article.
Other comments:
- Page 4, lines 5-7. It is no clear if some birds used in this study were the same ones that those
used for hand-reared group (16 birds) in reference 31. It seems not, because birds in hand-reared
group in reference 31 were taken from nest boxes at day 10 and not genetically closed. Please,
clarify it and add text to avoid any misunderstanding.
- Page 4 lines 47. From Supporting material, it seems clear that the empirical variable
denominated 'trial latency' is the time to complete each trial, rather than the time to start pecking
(as I understood initially). I think it should be clarified in text as it is not totally clear.
- Page 4 lines 47-49. According to the script in R, the interactions with sex were not included in
the analyses, however text is not clear about that. Please, specify which interactions are included
in the analyses.
- Page 5 lines 40-41. It seems contrary to that expected. Plenty seems to be more motivated to find
food than Lean (they finish trial faster), can it be a consequence of differences in cognitive
developmental?
- Page 6 lines 1 - 3. I think these 4g of difference between Easy and Hard birds when living in
aviaries are inflated as they are in part explained by the higher number of males in Easy group. I
would report values corrected by the factors in the model.
- Page 6 lines 57-60 differences found here could be explained by the higher number of males in
the Easy group.
I hope authors consider my comments useful and that they can be used to improve the
manuscript.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Emily Shepard):
This study relates the begging effort and food availability in European starling chicks to their
body mass and rates of food intake and body mass during adulthood. The manuscript has now
been reviewed by two experts in the field who agree that the study takes an ingenious approach
to tackle a very interesting topic. However, reviewer 2 has identified an important limitation,
with treatments being confounded with chick sex. We would be interested to see a revised
version of the manuscript if this can be addressed. Please pay careful attention to this point in the
responses to the reviewers comments.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Emily Shepard):
This study relates the begging effort and food availability in European starling chicks to their body mass
and rates of food intake and body mass during adulthood. The manuscript has now been reviewed by
two experts in the field who agree that the study takes an ingenious approach to tackle a very
interesting topic. However, reviewer 2 has identified an important limitation, with treatments being
confounded with chick sex. We would be interested to see a revised version of the manuscript if this can
be addressed. Please pay careful attention to this point in the responses to the reviewers comments.
WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK BOTH THE REVIEWERS AND THE EDITOR FOR
THE TIME SPENT REVIEWING OUR PAPER AND ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE USEFUL COMMENTS WE HAVE
RECEIVED, WHICH WE FEEL HAVE IMPROVED THE MANUSCRIPT. EACH COMMENT IS ADDRESSED IN IN
TURN BELOW MORE FULLY. WE WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASISE THAT WE HAVE INVESTIGATED REVIEWER
2’S CONCERNS AND HOPE THAT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BOTH HERE AND IN THE MANUSCRIPT
ADDRESSES THEM SUFFICIENTLY.

Review of: Dunn et al. Early-life begging effort…
Review by: Dan Blumstein
This is a mischievously difficult, but I think very important paper. The overall question is straightforward
and important: what are the consequences of early-life foraging experience on later life metabolic and
behavioral decisions. Here, the authors show how the consequences of early-life begging effort is
detectable 2 years on in starlings housed both socially and in smaller cages. It’s mischievous because
the idea is elegant but the methods required to show this were rather complex. I’m still not 100%
certain I understand the cyclic ratio task but I think I do enough to believe it is a valid measure of
defense of energy and I really like the contrast between defense of energy and fat storage.
The methods are generally clear. While I have no real issue with using the dredge function in
MuMIn…some may. I think that it’s defensible here and I think that the methods are wonderfully
described. I am a bit unclear as to how the correlation between the Staddon slope and the trial latency
against ratio requirement is meaningful (but I do see why the Staddon slope incorporates a ratio
correlation problem. Why not just use the other method?
WE THANK THE REVIEWER FOR THIS COMMENT BUT WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT WE DO USE OUR
METHOD AND NOT STADDON’S, WHICH WE MAKE CLEAR IN THE TEXT ON ORIGINAL PAGE 4 LINES 49-
51: “STRONGER DEFENCE OF ENERGY INTAKE AS FOOD BECOMES HARDER TO OBTAIN WILL MANIFEST
AS A SHALLOWER SLOPE OF INCREASING TRIAL LATENCY WITH INCREASING RATIO REQUIREMENT”.
TO AID CLARITY WE HAVE ADDED THE FOLLOWING TO THE SENTENCE STARTING ON ORIGINAL PAGE 4
LINE 55 “ … SO WE DID NOT USE STADDON SLOPES IN OUR MAIN ANALYSES”. THE CORRELATION
BETWEEN THE STADDON SLOPE AND TRIAL LATENCY IS ONLY MEANINGFUL IN THE SENSE THAT BOTH
DESCRIBE DEFENCE OF ENERGY INTAKE. STADDON’S SLOPE LINKS TO A MOLECULAR MODEL OF
FEEDING BEHAVIOUR, WHICH WE WERE NOT INTERESTED IN HERE. WE ONLY POINTED OUT THAT
OUR MEASURE OF DEFENCE OF ENERGY INTAKE WAS RELATED TO STADDON’S BECAUSE THE LATTER
IS MORE FREQUENTLY MENTIONED IN THE OPERANT LITERATURE, PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO THE
CYCLIC RATIO TASK. GIVEN THE BROAD READERSHIP OF RSOS, WE WANTED TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO
OPERANT SPECIALISTS THAT WE WERE AWARE OF THIS ALTERNATIVE BUT RELATED WAY OF
MEASURING DEFENCE OF ENERGY INTAKE, ALONG WITH A BRIEF EXPLANATION FOR WHY WE DID NOT
CHOOSE THE MORE ESTABLISHED APPROACH.
I applaud the authors for pointing out both congruencies and discrepancies with prior data/analyses.
Ultimately, these results provide new evidence for the myriad of ways that early life experiences can
influence later mass and foraging behavior. It’s gotten me thinking about the consequences of this for
analyses of compensatory growth and it integrates avian, mammalian and human phenomena nicely.
THANK YOU FOR THESE KIND COMMENTS AND WE ARE PLEASED OUR MANUSCRIPT HAS INSPIRED
THIS POSITIVE REACTION.

In this manuscript, Dunn et al. have done an ingenious experiment to determine how conditions during
nestling development affect how to storage and intake food when adults. Specifically, in a hand-reared
starling cohort, they manipulated during ten days in nestling development, the amount of food and the
effort to get it. Their results suggest that the nestlings who had to fight the most to get food, were those
who maintained had lighter body when they were adults, but it was also those who defended more their
rate of food intake when food was harder to get. On the other hand, nestlings that received more food
during the experimental manipulation were those able to get food faster when adults, even when it was
costly to obtain. Their results are relevant to understand differences in body size and foraging behaviour
among individuals sharing the same environment.
The manuscript is very well written, clear and concise. The methodology was also correct. The authors
paid special attention in the design of the experiment and in how to obtain the data needed for the
article. As far I can evaluate, statistical analyses are also correct. My thoughts on this manuscript have
been positive during most part review, however, I found an important problem that keeps these
thoughts from being so positive at the end. Unluckily, there was a bias in the distribution of sexes into
the experimental groups (see below). I hope authors can add additional information about it, and
moreover that they can discard and discuss any confounding effect on these results.
Authors have tried to control any confounding factor that could potentially influence on their results,
such as natal nest origin or initial weight differences, by assigning siblings to different experimental
nestling groups and by matching nestling by body size. That is totally correct, and by chance it would be
expected that any other differences among siblings, for example nestling sexes, would be randomly
distributed among the experimental groups. Namely, we would expect 4 males and 4 females in each of
the four experimental groups. However, despite nestlings were genetically sexed, this information was
not used (or it was not available) when the nestling assignations were done, and unluckily, that it was
not the case. According to the information in one of the data files (individuals.csv) one of the
experimental groups (Lean Easy) was composed of only males (7males, 0 females), while another group
(Plenty Hard) has 1 male and 7 females. The other groups have a similar number of females and males
(Lean Hard: 3 males and 4 females, Plenty Easy: 4 males and 4 females). That is important, as most of
the results of this article are based on comparisons between the Easy group (11 males and 4 females)
and the Hard group (4 males and 11 females) groups, which differ significantly in number of males and
females.
THANK YOU FOR THESE COMMENTS. THE REVIEWER IS CORRECT: THE LE GROUP ONLY HAD MALES
AND THE PH GROUP MAINLY HAD FEMALES. THIS WAS BECAUSE WE WERE NOT ABLE TO CONDUCT
OUR GENETIC SEXING QUICKLY ENOUGH AND SO WE HAD TO PROCEED WITH OUR DEVELOPMENTAL
MANIPULATION IN ABSENCE OF OUR SEXING RESULTS (BIRDS WERE TAKEN ON NESTS ON DAY 4 AND
BLOOD-SAMPLED AND WERE IMMEDIATELY RANDOMLY ALLOCATED A DEVELOPMENTAL TREATMENT TO
BEGIN EARLY NEXT MORNING). UNFORTUNATELY, WE WERE UNLUCKY IN OUR RANDOMISATION
PROCEDURE. TO MAKE THIS CLEAR TO THE READER, WE HAVE INCLUDED A SENTENCE IN OUR
METHODS BY INSERTING THE FOLLOWING TEXT ON ORIGINAL PAGE 3 LINE 26: “UNFORTUNATELY WE
WERE NOT ABLE TO GENETICALLY SEX OUR NESTLINGS PRIOR TO COMMENCING THE DEVELOPMENTAL
TREATMENT, WHICH LED TO AN UNBALANCED SEX RATIO (MALES:FEMALES) FOR THE LE (8:0) AND PH
(1:7) TREATMENT GROUPS”. WE ADMIT THIS IS A LIMITATION AND DESCRIBE HOW WE HAVE TRIED
TO INVESTIGATE THIS POTENTIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS BELOW IN MORE DETAIL.
The control during the statistical analysis of the sex of the animals is important, since the body condition
is clearly influenced by nestling sex (i.e. males consistently showed a better condition than females),
and in the case of foraging patterns, differences between males and females could also be plausible.
Despite most of the males belonged to the Easy group, and most of the females were 'Plenty', I could
understand and support that the inclusion of the nestling sex into the analyses could to control
differences between males and females. However, in my opinion, the bias in the distribution of sexes in
the experimental groups prevented the inclusion of any interaction terms between sex and other factors
included in the analyses. This is crucial, since it would allow either to rule out any confounding effect of
sex on the results from non-significant interactions between sex, Effort and Amount. On the other hand,
interaction terms would allow to detect differences in the effect of the experiment between males and
females, in that case, any significance of the Effort and Amount factors should be carefully examined.
With all this in mind, I am not totally convinced about the validity of the results and conclusions reached
in this manuscript. In my opinion, I think it would be important that, in addition to including in the text
the information about the bias in the distribution of sexes in the different groups, authors discuss in
detail any implication of this bias, and if possible, discard any effect of this bias on the results shown in
the article.
THANK YOU FOR THESE VALUABLE COMMENTS. AS THE REVIEWER CORRECTLY POINTS OUT, IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL TO INCLUDE A THREE-WAY INTERACTION BETWEEN SEX*AMOUNT*EFFORT
IN OUR GLOBAL MODELS TO TEST WHETHER SEX INTERACTED WITH DEVELOPMENTAL TREATMENT TO
AFFECT OUR OUTCOMES VARIABLES. AS THE REVIEWER HAS ASTUTELY IDENTIFIED, THIS THREE-WAY
INTERACTION WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT BECAUSE THE DISTRIBUTION OF SEXES IS
UNFORTUNATELY UNEVEN BETWEEN OUR DEVELOPMENTAL TREATMENT GROUPS. CONSEQUENTLY, IT
IS POSSIBLE THAT THE RESULTS FROM OUR FIRST TWO MODELS COULD REFLECT DIFFERENCES
OWING TO SEX, INSTEAD OF THE DIFFERENCES OWING TO DEVELOPMENTAL TREATMENT THAT WE
INTENDED TO INVESTIGATE.
TO EXPLORE THIS ISSUE FURTHER, WE IDENTIFIED THE SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECTS AND
INTERACTIONS THAT WERE RETAINED FROM OUR MODEL SELECTION AND MODEL AVERAGING
PROCEDURE FOR OUR FIRST TWO MODELS. WE THEN CREATED TWO NEW MODELS BASED ON THESE
PARAMETERS BUT ALSO INCLUDED INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SEX:AMOUNT AND SEX:EFFORT. IF THE
RESULTS FOUND IN OUR ORIGINAL MODELS WERE MAINLY DUE TO SEX DIFFERENCES THAN
DEVELOPMENTAL TREATMENT, WE PREDICTED THAT THE INCLUSION OF THESE NEW INTERACTIONS
WOULD ALTER OUR FINDINGS CONSIDERABLY. WE ALSO EXPECTED THAT THESE TWO NEW
INTERACTIONS MIGHT BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. AS FURTHER JUSTIFICATION FOR EXAMINING
THE TWO-WAY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SEX:AMOUNT AND SEX:EFFORT IN THIS WAY, WE DID NOT
FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF AN INTERACTION BETWEEN AMOUNT:EFFORT IN ANY OF OUR PREVIOUS MAIN
RESULTS.
WHEN WE RAN OUR TWO NEW MODELS, WE FOUND THAT ALL THE PARAMETERS THAT WERE
PREVIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT WERE STILL SIGNIFICANT AS BEFORE, AND IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND
OF SIMILAR MAGNITUDE. FURTHERMORE, NEITHER OF THE NEW TWO-WAY INTERACTIONS WERE
SIGNIFICANT. CONSEQUENTLY, WE JUDGE IT UNLIKELY THAT THE RESULTS WE FIRST PRESENTED
WERE CONFOUNDED BY THE UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION OF SEXES AMONG DEVELOPMENTAL TREATMENT
GROUPS.
TO MAKE THIS CLEAR TO THE READER, WE ADDED THE FOLLOWING TEXT ON ORIGINAL PAGE 40 LINE
60 IN THE METHODS: “GIVEN THAT SEX RATIO WAS UNBALANCED BY TREATMENT GROUP, WE ALSO
CONSTRUCTED MODELS THAT INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT PARAMETERS AND INTERACTIONS RETAINED
BY OUR MODEL SELECTION AND AVERAGING PROCEDURES, AND ADDITIONALLY INCLUDED
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SEX:AMOUNT AND SEX:EFFORT. THIS WAS TO RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY
THAT OUR RESULTS REFLECTED DIFFERENCES IN SEX, INSTEAD OF THE INTENDED EFFECT OF
DEVELOPMENTAL TREATMENT. THE INCLUSION OF THESE TWO ADDITIONAL INTERACTIONS DID NOT
CHANGE OUR RESULTS IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY, AND NOR DID THEY THEMSELVES HAVE A
SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR OUTCOME VARIABLES. CONSEQUENTLY, WE JUDGED IT UNLIKELY THAT
THE BIAS IN SEX RATIO CONFOUNDED THE EFFECTS OF DEVELOPMENTAL TREATMENT THAT WE
REPORT SUBSEQUENTLY”.
Other comments:
- Page 4, lines 5-7. It is no clear if some birds used in this study were the same ones that those used for
hand-reared group (16 birds) in reference 31. It seems not, because birds in hand-reared group in
reference 31 were taken from nest boxes at day 10 and not genetically closed. Please, clarify it and add
text to avoid any misunderstanding.
THANK YOU FOR THIS COMMENT. WE MEANT TO USE REFERENCE 31 TO DESCRIBE THE
EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP AND DID NOT MEAN TO IMPLY THAT THE SAME BIRDS WERE USED IN STUDY
31 AS IN THE PRESENT EXPERIMENT. WE HAVE CHANGED ‘AS DESCRIBED IN [31]’ TO ‘(OUR
EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP IS FULLY DESCRIBED IN [31], THOUGH NOTE THAT STUDY USED DIFFERENT
BIRDS)’.
- Page 4 lines 47. From Supporting material, it seems clear that the empirical variable denominated 'trial
latency' is the time to complete each trial, rather than the time to start pecking (as I understood
initially). I think it should be clarified in text as it is not totally clear.
THANK YOU FOR RAISING THIS ISSUE. WE ORIGINALLY SAID ON ORIGINAL PAGE 4 LINES 22-23 ‘THE
LATENCY BETWEEN THE ILLUMINATION OF THE AMBER KEY AND KEY PECK WAS COLLECTED FOR
EVERY TRIAL AND HIS HEREAFTER TERMED ‘TRIAL LATENCY’, WHICH WE ADMIT IS CONFUSING AND
NOT WHAT WE INTENDED TO CONVEY. TO CLARIFY, WE HAVE AMENDED THIS TO, ‘THE LATENCY
BETWEEN THE FIRST AND FINAL KEY PECK WAS COLLECTED FOR EVERY TRIAL AND IS HEREAFTER
TERMED ‘TRIAL LATENCY’’.
- Page 4 lines 47-49. According to the script in R, the interactions with sex were not included in the
analyses, however text is not clear about that. Please, specify which interactions are included in the
analyses.
TO CLARIFY, WE HAVE AMENDED THE SENTENCE FROM ‘CANDIDATE FIXED EFFECTS WERE: SEX,
TARSUS LENGTH, RATIO REQUIREMENT, AMOUNT, EFFORT AND THEIR INTERACTION’ TO ‘CANDIDATE
FIXED EFFECTS WERE: SEX, TARSUS LENGTH, RATIO REQUIREMENT, AMOUNT, EFFORT AND ALL
POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN AMOUNT, EFFORT AND RATIO REQUIREMENT’. WE HAVE
EXPLAINED WHY WE CHOSE TO CONSTRUCT OUR MODEL IN THIS WAY IN MORE DETAIL IN RESPONSE
TO REVIEWER 2’S GENERAL COMMENTS.
- Page 5 lines 40-41. It seems contrary to that expected. Plenty seems to be more motivated to find
food than Lean (they finish trial faster), can it be a consequence of differences in cognitive
developmental?
PLENTY BIRDS DID COMPLETE TRIALS FASTER THAN LEAN BIRDS; HOWEVER, THERE IS NOTHING
COGNITIVELY DIFFICULT ABOUT PECKING A KEY AND WE THINK THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE
RESULT WE REPORTED IS A CONSEQUENCE OF DIFFERENCES IN COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT. TO
SUPPORT OUR ARGUMENT FURTHER, WE HAVE NEVER FOUND ANY OBVIOUS REARING-CONDITION
EFFECTS ON BASIC LEARNING SPEED IN PREVIOUS STUDIES WE HAVE CONDUCTED WITH DIFFERENT
COHORTS OF STARLINGS. PLEASE SEE THE FOLLOWING REFERENCES FOR FURTHER DETAILS: 1)

2015. DEVELOPMENTAL AND FAMILIAL PREDICTORS OF ADULT COGNITIVE TRAITS IN THE EUROPEAN
STARLING. ANIM. BEH. 107: 239-248.
WE HAVE ADDED FURTHER INFORMATION ON ORIGINAL PAGE 6 LINE 6 TO CLARIFY THAT THE HARD
BIRDS NOT ONLY DEFENDED THEIR ENERGY INTAKE MORE THAN EASY BIRDS, BUT THAT THEY ALSO
FORAGED LESS RAPIDLY WHEN THE COSTS OF OBTAINING FOOD ARE LOW: “FURTHERMORE, THESE
BIRDS ALSO FORAGED LESS RAPIDLY IN COMPARISON TO BIRDS THAT HAD RECEIVED THE EASY
TREATMENT WHEN THE COSTS OF OBTAINING FOOD WERE LOW”.
- Page 6 lines 1 - 3. I think these 4g of difference between Easy and Hard birds when living in aviaries
are inflated as they are in part explained by the higher number of males in Easy group. I would report
values corrected by the factors in the model.
THANK YOU FOR THIS COMMENT. OUR INTENTION WAS TO DESCRIBE THE BODY MASS CONDITION
DIFFERENCES SEEN IN FIGURE 2 AND BASED ON THE RAW DATA. WE HAVE CHANGED THIS
INFORMATION TO 2G, WHICH IS THE MODEL-CORRECTED VALUE.
- Page 6 lines 57-60 differences found here could be explained by the higher number of males in the
Easy group.
TO ADDRESS THIS POSSIBILITY WE HAVE RUN ADDITIONAL MODELS AS DESCRIBED IN THE METHODS
AND HOPE THAT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED NOW ADDRESSES THIS POSSIBILITY, WHICH WE
JUDGE AS UNLIKELY.
I hope authors consider my comments useful and that they can be used to improve the manuscript.
