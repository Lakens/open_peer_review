Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
This is an interesting and well-written paper that makes a nice contribution to the study of avian
influenza virus in wild birds. The authors numerically solve a compartmental model of AIV in a
migratory population, showing primarily that lower recovery rates increase the likelihood of AIV
translocation within the migratory population. My major and minor concerns are outlined below:
Major concerns:
1. The primary results rest on a series of model simulations and sensitivity analyses, but it is
unclear how the authors varied the four parameters (beta, r, mu, v) and how they quantified
sensitivity. From the text (L173-188), I was expecting some kind of Latin hypercube sampling
approach to vary most possible combinations of parameters, but Figure 3 suggests that only four
a priori values per parameter were assessed. Did you simply assess all possible combinations of
these four values across the four parameters? It is also unclear how "sensitivity" of results to
parameter variation was quantified (e.g., L211), as no standard measures of sensitivity (e.g.,
partial rank correlations) are included. I would encourage either justifying the use of these four
values per parameter or using something like the LHS approach to better sample parameter space
and measure sensitivity of your model outcomes to parameter variation.
2. While the key results of the model analysis may be novel within the AIV system (L251-260), I
think it's worth noting in your discussion that many of these insights could be generated from a
far simpler SIR model (e.g., a simple SI/SIS/SIR would also tell you that a lower infection
recovery rate will increase transmission potential). Some clarification of what this model tells us
beyond a more parsimonious model could help improve clarity.
3. A very helpful contribution of your analysis is to guide field surveillance and control (L285-
288). Because you note that these pathobiological features could help prioritize surveillance and
control, you should also discuss how researchers could glean this information about a particular
AIV strain. For example, how could one assess a high transmission rate or a high recovery rate in
the early phases of strain discovery?
4. While the paper has no empirical data, I strongly suggest the authors upload their R code to
increase reproducibility.
Minor comments:
L71: This statement on concerns for human pandemics could use a citation
L132: change “recovery” to “recover”
L209: It would help to define marginal likelihood and how this was quantified
L217 and elsewhere: It may be more intuitive to denote recovery rate as the duration of the
infection period (e.g., 13 days) rather than the current form (recovery rate of 1/13 day-1).
L226: I was a little confused about the use of density histograms. Wouldn’t these just show you

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The manuscript describes a modeling study that investigates the role of various infection
parameters in the spatial spread of influenza virus. I find the study and approach interesting, but
have a major concern about the model that I believe needs to be addressed. Therefore, I
recommend major revision.
Major concerns:
1. It's not entirely clear that this will change the conclusions reached by the study, but I believe
that the interplay between illness and migration has not been correctly formulated. The model
assumes that infected birds in I1 and recovering birds in R1 are too sick to migrate, but that birds
in I2 (which comes AFTER I1) and R2 can migrate. This basically suggests that immediately upon
infection, birds are too ill to fly, but as the disease progresses, they are again able to fly. However,
once they start to recover they are again too ill to migrate, but then finally recover enough to
migrate again. It would make more sense to me if I2 and R1 were the two groups that are unable
to migrate.
2. The authors state that the simulations are stochastic, but do not describe the algorithm used to
solve the model equations stochastically. Additionally, their code does not seem to be available
anywhere.
Minor comments:
1. The model includes 9 patches, but the analyses only considers transmission of virus up to patch
5. It's not clear to me why the authors are including the remaining patches if they don't analyze
what happens when the birds move there. In fact, the authors added the 9th patch from a
previous 8 patch model, which seems like a useless addition since it is never used.

2. Figures 2 and 4 are very difficult to interpret. There needs to be more guidance in the
manuscript on what exactly is being plotted.

or concerns:
1. The primary results rest on a series of model simulations and sensitivity analyses, but it is
unclear how the authors varied the four parameters (beta, r, mu, v) and how they quantified
sensitivity. From the text (L173-188), I was expecting some kind of Latin hypercube

like the LHS approach to better sample parameter space and measure sensitivity of your

er reading the reviewer’s comments, we re-ran the baseline model with 600 parameter
binations sampled using LHS. To quantify the sensitivity and present these findings in the
sed manuscript, we have calculated partial rank correlation coefficients based on the results
m re-running the model. We have re-drawn Figures 2, 3 and 4, and the results of the partial
k correlation are shown in Table 3 and Table 4. Model findings remain unchanged.

2. While the key results of the model analysis may be novel within the AIV system (L251-260),
I think it's worth noting in your discussion that many of these insights could be generated
from a far simpler SIR model (e.g., a simple SI/SIS/SIR would also tell you that a lower
infection recovery rate will increase transmission potential). Some clarification of what
this model tells us beyond a more parsimonious model could help improve clarity.
nk you for your comments and suggestion. In this model, we considered bird movement and
s translocation along the birds’ flyway, in order to simulate AIV dissemination. Compared to
mpler SIR model, this model form not only considers three infection states for the birds—
eptible, infected, and recovered—but also loss and recovery of the ability to migrate induced
nfection. These latter conditions can impact the dynamic of infection translocation along the
re flyway. According to Galsworthy et al. (2011), after including migration delay, the scale of
outbreak becomes smaller than in a simpler SIR model without migration delay, which is
buted to infected birds being isolated from the main population of susceptible birds. We have
ed some clarification on this issue to the revised manuscript (L272 – L281).
3. A very helpful contribution of your analysis is to guide field surveillance and control
(L285-288). Because you note that these pathobiological features could help prioritize
surveillance and control, you should also discuss how researchers could glean this
information about a particular AIV strain. For example, how could one assess a high
transmission rate or a high recovery rate in the early phases of strain discovery?
nk you for your suggestion. We have added discussion of these issues to the revised manuscript
illustrate what information might be provided for AIV laboratory experiments and how
archers might assess the risk of a novel virus (L315– L322).

nk you for the comments and suggestions. In this model, once the birds are infected (birds in
they are unable to migrate. Infected birds in I1 can recover but remain unable to migrate, R1,
subsequently regain their migratory ability to R2, or infected birds in I1 can regain the
ratory ability while remaining infectious, I2, then subsequently recover to R2. That is, the
ction recovery and migration recovery are independent of each other, and the birds can first
ver from infection then regain the ability to migrate, or first regain the ability to migrate then
ver from infection. The flowchart of the model is shown in Figure R2.1. As the reviewer

patch 5. It's not clear to me why the authors are including the remaining patches if they
don't analyze what happens when the birds move there. In fact, the authors added the 9th
patch from a previous 8 patch model, which seems like a useless addition since it is never
used.
reviewer is correct. We now just describe 8 patches (L114 – L117). Only translocation to
h 5 is studied, as we are interested in the initial dispersal of the virus (not its return back where
already present). The importance of patch 5 is discussed at the beginning of the Results section.
