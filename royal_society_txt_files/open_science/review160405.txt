The authors proposed a computational method for sharp interface advection, which seems out-
perform several algebraic VOF methods used in commercial codes. However, this manuscript is
not recommended for publication due to the following several critical issues:
1. Since the proposed method relies on the geometrical reconstruction as described on Secs. 2 and
3, it is a geometric VOF method. However, the authors did not compare it with other geometric
VOF methods even these methods are noted by the authors.
2. Showing a geometric VOF method is more accurate but much slower than algebraic VOF
methods is nothing new. It is well known as also pointed out by the author in the introduction.
3. Comparing their results with those obtained by commercial codes does not indicate any
significance of their method except they show that the methods in the commercial codes
representing the state of art. Unfortunately, it is not the case here.

The main emphasis of the present work concerns a VoF solution using an geometric interface
reconstruction, which is used to update local (cell based) liquid fractions. In the work, it is shown
explicitly that this advection is based on the time and surface area integral for adjacent cell faces,
where phase transport is occurring.
3
Overall, the work is valuable and it should be published. However, there are some issues that
should be address satisfactorily before publication:
1) The authors describe this time and surface integral formulation as being a novelty of their
approach. It should be made clear that this is concept has been around for at least 16 years, and
has been published previously.
Consider for instance:
a) A new volume of fluid advection algorithm: the defined donating region scheme (D. Harvie
and D. Fletcher, Int. J. Num. Methods in Fluids:2001
b) Highly accurate Lagrangian flux calculation via algebraic quadratures on spline-approximated
donating regions
( Qinghai Zhang, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 264 (2013) 191–204)
The authors should also search ‘donating region VoF’ to see if there is anything in JCP or similar
journals that has been published in this regard. Work along this line of thought was presented in
APS DFD 2014 meeting in San Francisco, and probably now those works are in the journals.
2) It is not clear in Eq. (1.1) what is this arbitrary volume. For instance, if this volume is a material
region, then by the Reynolds Transport Theorem this equation is wrong, since the second term is
already accounted for in the first term. Also, if this arbitrary volume is moving at some arbitrary
speed this equation is wrong. The only way to make sense of this governing equation is to
actually have the volume fixed in space, but then why take the time derivative outside the
integral ? It is confusing.
Please present a derivation of this equation. It is central to the problem being addressed here.
3) By convention, you should not use \rho (in LaTeX) to denote an indicator function. This
quantity \rho is understood to be density, and its use to indicate something else will be confusing
to the reader.
4) Similar comment for \sigma_ij. This quantity by convention represents a stress tensor, not a
quantity that takes -1 or +1. Also, why do you need this? For instance, by stating that the normal
area vector dS always points outward from the cell in question, this negative sign issue should be
automatically handled.
5) Due to widespread use of the interfoam code in both academia and industry, comparisons
against this code should be made here.
6) The metrics used do not show rate of convergence information. Also, it seems that only the
average norms are used for errors, for instance L1 error norms. The authors should provide some
information on a L_inf (L-infinity norm) and how this norm behaves with grid resolution. This
will be highly informative when it comes time to comparing the different methodologies.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
I am impressed with the paper, and am happy to support its publication *nearly* as-is. The
description is clear and easy to follow, and the final results in many cases vastly surpass the
comparison methods. The method seems comparatively simple to implement, and if the code is
indeed made available and/or incorporated into OpenFOAM as promised, I could see it having
wide impact. I have a few very minor comments.
On page 8, the choice of interpolation ("inverse point-to-cell-centre interpolation") is very briefly
glossed over, so I would like to see it spelled out exactly what this term means. Is this some
variant of Shepard interpolation? Even better would be to describe and evaluate the mentioned
alternative (volume weighting).
The comparisons provided are all against algebraic VOF schemes. It's not made clear how the
algorithm is expected to fare against existing geometric VOF schemes for general meshes, which
is noted as "an active area of research". Is this choice not to compare against geometric schemes
because there are no freely available implementations, or because the complexity of (re-)doing an
implementation of one of these methods is high, or because they are not popular in existing
software packages? Some expanded commentary on why the choice of these 3 schemes (and not
geometric ones) is the most appropriate would be helpful.
Can the method be compared against result data from an existing geometric VOF scheme paper
without necessarily requiring an implementation to be found/written?
There's one instance of "loosing" that should say "losing".
7
The notation for large integers in the paper uses decimals rather than spaces or commas. (e.g. "we
used a mesh with 10.131.041 cells"), but the same mark is used to indicate the decimal point in
real numbers ("0.0078)". This is not a convention I'm familiar with, and to avoid confusion I'd
probably advocate for changing the former to use either commas or spaces.
There are some weird characters in the bibliography (refs 8 and 9) that should be corrected.

Dear Associate Editor
Thank you for agreeing with our appeal and for accepting a resubmission of a revised version of our
nitially rejected manuscript entitled "A Computational Method for Sharp Interface Advection” (RSOS-
150704).
Please find on the following pages our response to reviewer 2 who recommended the manuscript for
publication with a number of minor changes.
In the revised manuscript, all major changes to the original manuscript are marked in the following way:
The original text is red and the new text is blue. We therefore kindly ask the reviewers to disregard any
red text except when they need to see what has changed since the original submission.
Since the original submission, we have optimized the IsoAdvector code so it is now significantly faster.
Therefore all simulations have been rerun and the updated error measures and calculation times have
been inserted in figures and tables. The solution quality is unaltered, but the calculation times are now
similar to – actually slightly faster than – the fastest reference schemes, HRIC and CICSAM, and
significantly faster than MULES. We are now very confident that IsoAdvector represents a significant
advancement and will have a large impact within the field of interfacial CFD.
Kind regards on behalf of the authors,
Johan Rønby

Response to Reviewer 2
------------------------------------------------------------
In the following we address the issues raised by reviewer 2.
Quotes from the review report are surrounded by #############.
Our response is surrounded by ============
###################################
1) The authors describe this time and surface integral formulation as being a novelty of their approach.
It should be made clear that this is concept has been around for at least 16 years, and has been
published previously.
Consider for instance:
a) A new volume of fluid advection algorithm: the defined donating region scheme (D. Harvie and D.
Fletcher, Int. J. Num. Methods in Fluids:2001
b) Highly accurate Lagrangian flux calculation via algebraic quadratures on spline-approximated
donating regions
( Qinghai Zhang, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 264 (2013) 191–204)
The authors should also search ‘donating region VoF’ to see if there is anything in JCP or similar journals
that has been published in this regard. Work along this line of thought was presented in APS DFD 2014
meeting in San Francisco, and probably now those works are in the journals.
###################################
==================================
It is incorrect that we describe the “time and surface integrated formulation” of the continuity equation
to be a novelty of our approach. Please be more specific about where this claim is made in our paper. Is
t the derivation leading from the continuity equation (1.1) to (1.5)? These are simply a few definitions
and a formal time integration. It has not been the intention to present this as a result or novelty of our
paper, and we find it difficult to see how one can get this impression. An equation similar to eqn. 1.5
does indeed appear in reference b) (their eqn. 1.3) but not in reference a). We could have chosen to
exclude our derivation from eqn. 1.1 to 1.5 and just refer to ref b) or one of the many other papers
where a similar equation appears. We believe, however, that this will not benefit the readability of the
paper, and we have therefore chosen to keep it as it is.
Just to be clear, here is what we do claim to be novel in our approach:
1) The way we exploit isosurface calculations to model the liquid (Fluid A) distribution inside cells in the
reconstruction step. This avoids the step used in many VOF schemes of calculating the numerical
cause troubles because the numerically sought function is actually a Dirac delta function.
2) The treatment of the time integration of the submerged face area as the interface passes an arbitrary
polygonal face. The novelty is the way we divide the integration into sub time intervals as the face-
nterface intersection line passes the polygonal vertices. This is what makes our method work on
unstructured meshes.
Neither of the papers a) and b) suggested by Reviewer 2 can be justifiably said to already contain these
deas, nor to demonstrate similarly accurate results on unstructured 3D meshes.
To make it more clear in the article what we claim to be new, we have added a number of paragraph to
the conclusion section.
==================================
###################################
2) It is not clear in Eq. (1.1) what is this arbitrary volume. For instance, if this volume is a material
region, then by the Reynolds Transport Theorem this equation is wrong, since the second term is already
accounted for in the first term. Also, if this arbitrary volume is moving at some arbitrary speed this
equation is wrong. The only way to make sense of this governing equation is to actually have the
volume fixed in space, but then why take the time derivative outside the integral ? It is confusing.
Please present a derivation of this equation. It is central to the problem being addressed here.
###################################
==================================
We have clarified things by stressing below the equation that the volume in question is indeed
stationary.
Equation 1.1 as it stands could be derived by starting with the continuity equation in differential form.
However, even though we acknowledge that most readers will be more familiar with its differential form,
such a derivation would be a pseudo-derivation, since the integral form in eqn 1.1 is actually the starting
point for the mathematical derivation of the differential form of the continuity equation.
We note that the d/dt is just the ordinary differentiation with respect to t. This is because when you
ntegrate a function rho(x,t) over x then the resulting integral is only a function of t and the
“\partial/\partial t” is not necessary. The d/dt is outside the integral for the reader to read the equation
as an expression for the “rate of change of mass inside the volume”. This is exactly what we are looking
for when V is a control volume.
==================================
###################################
3) By convention, you should not use \rho (in LaTeX) to denote an indicator function. This quantity \rho
s understood to be density, and its use to indicate something else will be confusing to the reader.
###################################
==================================
It is incorrect that we are using $\rho$ for indicator function. We are using $\hat{\rho}$, to indicate
that this is indeed just the density, albeit a shifted and scaled version of it. There is no clear convention
n literature. Some use $I$, some use $f$. We have changed it to $H$ to make the distinction to $\rho$
more clear (H is the letter used by Tryggvason and Zaleski in their book “Direct Numerical Simulations
of Gas-Liquid Multiphase Flows”).
==================================
###################################
4) Similar comment for \sigma_ij. This quantity by convention represents a stress tensor, not a quantity
that takes -1 or +1. Also, why do you need this? For instance, by stating that the normal area vector dS
always points outward from the cell in question, this negative sign issue should be automatically
handled.
###################################
==================================
The quantity sigma_ij is needed because we need to work with each face separately and independently
of which cell it belongs to. Thus, we must choose a direction of the normal for each face. This direction
will then be outward for one of its cells, but inward for the other. Sigma_ij changes the face direction for
possible to define \Delta V_ij, as we do in eqn. (1.6), such that it could be substituted into eqn. (1.7) to
obtain eqn. (1.5). Regarding choice of symbol, we have changed it to s_ij to avoid confusion.
==================================
###################################
5) Due to widespread use of the interfoam code in both academia and industry, comparisons against this
code should be made here.
###################################
==================================
Well, this is actually what we do: InterFoam solves the interface advection step using MULES (our 1st
reference scheme) and the pressure-velocity coupling using a variant of the PISO algorithm. Indeed, all
our shown MULES results are obtained using the interFoam solver with the PISO algorithm deactivated
(since our velocity field is predetermined). We have now emphasized this in the Results section.
==================================
###################################
6) The metrics used do not show rate of convergence information. Also, it seems that only the average
norms are used for errors, for instance L1 error norms. The authors should provide some information on
a L_inf (L-infinity norm) and how this norm behaves with grid resolution. This will be highly informative
when it comes time to comparing the different methodologies.
###################################
==================================
We have now included converge orders for the test cases where three grid resolutions are available.
That is:
4.1: Disc in steady 2D flow – square mesh: Order = 2.4
4.2: Spiraling disc – square, triangular and polygonal meshes: Order = 1.9, 1.7, and 1.9, respectively.
4.3: Sphere in steady uniform 3D flow: Order = 2.6-3.2.
4.4: Sphere in non-uniform 3D flow – hex mesh (here we have now replaced the two simulations with dx
= 1/100 and dx = 1/200 with three simulations using dx = 1/64, 1/128, and 1/256 to be able to
calculate the convergence order): Order = 2.3.
It is incorrect that we use average norms. The measure $E_1$ is not an average quantity. It is the total
volume of fluid in the numerical solution not overlapping with the exact solution. The norms
min($\alpha$) and 1-max($\alpha$) chosen to show boundedness errors are in fact L-infinity norms in
the sense that they show the min and max cell errors. This has now been clarified in the Results
section.
We already have quite a few different error measures in the paper to quantify the solution quality. They
have been carefully chosen to cover all the ways a VOF method can fail: lack of shape preservation
(E_1), lack of volume conservation ($\delta V_rel$), lack of boundedness (min and max of $\alpha$),
and lack of surface sharpness ($\delta W_{rel}$). To keep the number of tables and figures at a
manageable level, we have chosen not to include any further error measures.

neral Comments
<U+F0B7> The writing is cumbersome and not grammatically correct, leading the reader to
conclude that the authors did not take care to proofread or are lacking in basic English
skills. The grammatical errors are so distracting that the reader will likely abandon
reading this article within a few pages. Very poor!
<U+F0B7> Despite the poor overall presentation of the material in this manuscript, and the long
and very specific comments (below) that the authors should address, the work
conveyed here by the authors is new, novel, and a contribution to the field. Specifically,
the main (if not only) contribution here is the algorithm for capturing the temporal
topology change of the interface (isosurface) within a cell through interpolation of
vertex velocities and recomputation of the isosurface (Section 2.2 and 3.0). This is a very
interesting and novel algorithm that directly addresses the challenge for volume
tracking algorithms (“VOF”) on 3D unstructured meshes, namely the need for robust
multi-dimensional (“unsplit”) fluxing, which is a solved problem on 3D structured
meshes. This approach, while still fraught with potential problems (e.g., allowing the
solenoidality of the velocity field to more actively constrain the subcell isosurface
toplogy), is a nice advance. The authors should clean up their presentation (spoon feed
the reader more!), carefully proofread the manuscript, and address this reviewers’
comments.
cific Comments
<U+F0B7> [p. 5]: First sentence after equation (1.5) is not true. A first order approximation to the
time derivative of alpha has been used, hence this equation is not exact.
<U+F0B7> [p. 5]: Second sentence after equation (1.5) makes no sense (not grammatically correct).
<U+F0B7> [p. 5]: Sentence right before equation (1.7) makes no sense (not grammatically correct).
<U+F0B7> [p. 5]: In equation (1.8), why not a center of mass velocity with a density term in the
volume integral? The current expression will lead to problems for high density ratio
interfacial flows (e.g., in water-air interfacial cells)
<U+F0B7> [p. 5]: The statement “we want our subgrid model to “detect” this capture this local
distribution information” makes no sense.
<U+F0B7> [p. 6]: Does ParaView use the Marching Cubes algorithm for computing isosurfaces? The
authors should give more details on the algorithm used by ParaView (since apparently
this was an inspiration)
<U+F0B7> [p. 6]: “This is an unavoidable price we must pay to ensure that isofaces cut surface cells
into subcells having the correct volumetric proportions” is not true; past work has
shown that piecewise linear (or planar in 3D) volume fractions can be made continuous
(from cell to cell) by iterating on the plane normal.
<U+F0B7> [p. 6]: In Section 2.2, was a 4th or 5th order RK time integration algorithm ever
considered instead of the 1st order integration presented?
<U+F0B7> [p. 8]: The sentence “ . . . is found by simple bisection root findingthe following
procedure . . .” makes no sense.
<U+F0B7> [p. 9]: In the first paragraph, how often is “rare” where the LU solution does not provide
useful solutions?
<U+F0B7> [p. 9]: The phrase “due of to the cell-to-vertex interpolation” makes no sense.
<U+F0B7> [p. 9]: The phrase “same as for a regularany other mesh face” makes no sense.
<U+F0B7> [p. 9]: In section 3.2, where any other methods for the face normal tried other then an
area weighted valued of the triangular face normal?
<U+F0B7> [p. 9]: By “decomposing the cell into tetrahedral all sharing the cell centre . . .” is it
implied that this method will only work for center element types or for polyhedra in
general?
<U+F0B7> [p. 9]: In section 3.2, for velocity interpolation from vertices to point Xs, is density
weighting used? If not this could be very problematic for high density ratio flows. Also is
it true that the base assumption here is that the flow solver is vertex-centered for its
momentum control volume? The linear interpolation of velocities within a cell implies
an inherent 2nd order spatial discretization assumption (for velocity), otherwise the
interpolation must be consistent with the underlying Navier-Stokes discretization
scheme (e.g., the subcell velocity interpolation would have to be quadratic for a 3 rd
order discretization, etc.). Also, this kind of interpolation in general breaks the
solenoidality constraint, which is likely why volume fractions are not monotonic
(between zero and one) after advection, hence the need for “redistribution”.
<U+F0B7> [p. 9]: In the last paragraph, the phrase “. . . do by findingestimating the times . . .”
makes no sense.
<U+F0B7> [p. 10]: Equation (3.3) assumes 1st order in time – what if a higher order discretization is
used?
<U+F0B7> [p. 10]: Does equation (3.5) imply that time subcycling is used? If so, then what value of
M is advised? If not, then this expression and associated text should be clarified.
<U+F0B7> [p. 10/11]: The introductory text of Section 3.4 (“Bounding procedure”) is not quite right
in that it reasons the introduction of new volume extrema (<0 or >1) as being because
“there will inevitably be small errors, which, in cases where a cell is completely emptied
or filled during a time step, will cause the algorithm to miss 0 or 1 by a small amount.”
The only reason for the over- or under-shoots, on the contrary, is owing to the fact that
volumes swept out multi-dimensional (“unsplit) and are not computed from a true
multi-dimensional solenoidal velocity field; rather local approximations are made about
the velocity field (solenoidal in a single direction) that are incorrect. This issue is
addressed, e.g., in a recent 2008 article (SIAM J. SCI. COMPUT, Vol. 31, No. 2, pp. 865–
889).
<U+F0B7> [p. 12]: For error measures, why not just use L1, L2, and L-infinity for all measures? The
authors choose to use L1 and/or L-infinity for certain cases. Why?
<U+F0B7> Performance comparison – the authors have chosen to use other algorithms for
comparison that are more based on convenience (MULES, HRIC, CICSAM) then use the
“best” published algorithm (e.g., that of Liovic et al.). Why? Is it not true these choices
shed the best possible light on the algorithm documented in this paper?
<U+F0B7> Disk in uniform flow (Figures 4-6): The comparison results (MULES, HRIC, CICSAM) are
terrible! These would not have been appropriate to use 25 years ago, much less now.
The results do not entice the reader to necessarily embrace IsoAdvector because the
baseline comparisons are so poor.
<U+F0B7> [p. 17]: “wholes” should be “holes”.

ments to the Author(s)
impressed with the paper, and am happy to support its publication *nearly* as-is. The description is
r and easy to follow, and the final results in many cases vastly surpass the comparison methods. The
hod seems comparatively simple to implement, and if the code is indeed made available and/or
rporated into OpenFOAM as promised, I could see it having wide impact. I have a few very minor
ments.
nk you. The code including all test case setups will be released on github.com/isoadvector
ltaneously with the publication of this manuscript.
age 8, the choice of interpolation ("inverse point-to-cell-centre interpolation") is very briefly glossed
, so I would like to see it spelled out exactly what this term means. Is this some variant of Shepard
polation? Even better would be to describe and evaluate the mentioned alternative (volume
hting).
arify matters, we have rephrased the first paragraph in section 3.1 to:
first step in calculating the isosurface is to interpolate the volume fractions to the grid points of the
h. The value in a grid point will in general be a linear combination of the volume fractions in the cells
ing this point. Here, we have chosen to use the inverse of the distances between a grid point and the
ounding cell centres as the weights in this interpolation step. Other options could be to use the cell
mes or solid angles as interpolation weights. A systematic study of the influence of this choice is left for
re work.”
comparisons provided are all against algebraic VOF schemes. It's not made clear how the algorithm is
cted to fare against existing geometric VOF schemes for general meshes, which is noted as "an active
of research". Is this choice not to compare against geometric schemes because there are no freely
able implementations, or because the complexity of (re-)doing an implementation of one of these
hods is high, or because they are not popular in existing software packages? Some expanded
mentary on why the choice of these 3 schemes (and not geometric ones) is the most appropriate
ld be helpful.
the method be compared against result data from an existing geometric VOF scheme paper without
ssarily requiring an implementation to be found/written?

notation for large integers in the paper uses decimals rather than spaces or commas. (e.g. "we used a
h with 10.131.041 cells"), but the same mark is used to indicate the decimal point in real numbers
078)". This is not a convention I'm familiar with, and to avoid confusion I'd probably advocate for
ging the former to use either commas or spaces.

erefore, it could be a good idea to alter the velocity estimate of the interface to a “one-

]: Does ParaView use the Marching Cubes algorithm for computing isosurfaces ? The authors

e not aware of the details of the method used by Paraview. It cannot be marching cubes, since
ethod is limited to cubic cells and Paraview can make isosurfaces for data on general
ctured meshes. This, however, is beside the point, which is that the idea, not the
entation details, was inspired by our usage of Paraview. To clarify this, we have changed the

for visualising surfaces. Numerically calculated isosurfaces are topologically consistent
uous surfaces and straightforward to calculate on arbitrary polyhedral meshes”

ostprocessing of interfacial CFD data. Here, it is custom to visualize the fluid interface (e.g.
umerically calculated isosurfaces are topologically consistent continuous surfaces, and are

he sentence contains the word “isofaces” it should be clear that it is in the context of using
ace calculation that the statement holds. That being said, your statement “that piecewise
or planar in 3D) volume fractions can be made continuous (from cell to cell) by iterating on the
normal” cannot be strictly true in general. It is not difficult to come up with simple examples of
e fraction data on a simple 2D square mesh, where there is no way of fiddling with straight
tting lines to make them:
a) cut cells into the correct volume fractions and
b) connect at the faces.
or instance of a 2x2 square cell mesh with all volume fractions being 0.2:
0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2
?
0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.2
here is a solution, which is an inclined square around the central mesh point (left panel in
above). There is actually a 1-parameter family of solutions because we can move the cutting
on the two vertical faces away from the central vertex as long as we move the cutting points
horizontal faces correspondingly inwards to preserve the enclosed area (see middle panel
for an example). But now change one of the cell alpha values to, say, 0.4 (right panel above).

see response to your first general comment above.
]: The phrase “same as for a regularany other mesh face” makes no sense.
]: In section 3.2, where any other methods for the face normal tried other then an area
ed valued of the triangular face normal?
the best of our knowledge, this is the most robust method for general meshes. More
tationally efficient methods can be used if assumptions are made (e.g. the face being exactly
). But since this is not a critical part of the code in terms of calculation speed, there is no point
ificing robustness for a small efficiency gain.
]: By “decomposing the cell into tetrahedral all sharing the cell centre . . .” is it implied that
ethod will only work for center element types or for polyhedra in general?
ethod works on general polyhedra. When needed, a polyhedron is decomposed into tetrahedra
rting a geometric centroid point into each face, decomposing the face into triangle using the
ntre, and then creating tetrahedra towards the volumetric centroid of a polyhedron.
]: In section 3.2, for velocity interpolation from vertices to point Xs, is density weighting used? If
s could be very problematic for high density ratio flows. Also is it true that the base assumption
that the flow solver is vertex-centered for its momentum control volume? The linear
lation of velocities within a cell implies an inherent 2nd order spatial discretization assumption
locity), otherwise the interpolation must be consistent with the underlying Navier-Stokes
ization scheme (e.g., the subcell velocity interpolation would have to be quadratic for a 3 rd
discretization, etc.). Also, this kind of interpolation in general breaks the solenoidality constraint,
is likely why volume fractions are not monotonic (between zero and one) after advection, hence
ed for “redistribution”.
uestion:
e answer to 4th specific comment. There is a lot of options to try out here. In general, we have
o focus on describing the basic idea of IsoAdvector leaving room for improvements in details
s this. Clearly, in the pure advection test cases presented in the manuscript the densities and
atio are immaterial.
d question:
e OpenFOAM solver is based on a coupling between volumetric face fluxes (the <U+0001D719><U+0001D457> ’s in
on 1.9) and the pressure. Within a time step the cell-centred velocities (the <U+0001D448><U+0001D456> ’s in equation
re reconstructed from the face fluxes only after the pressure<->face flux coupling has been
with the PISO algorithm. Thus, solenoidal in this code means that the face fluxes of a cell
zero.
]: In the last paragraph, the phrase “. . . do by findingestimating the times . . .” makes no sens e.

elocity data from previous time steps to estimate the isoface acceleration during the time step
calculating the velocity gradient from surrounding cell velocity data to approximate the isoface
n around its two tangential axes during the time step. Work along these lines is left for future
pment.”
0]: Does equation (3.5) imply that time subcycling is used? If so, then what value of M is
d? If not, then this expression and associated text should be clarified.
st phrase in Section 3.4, just before equation (3.5), describes the exact definition of the times

ined in equation 3.3) that lie within the interval [<U+0001D461>, <U+0001D461> + <U+0001D6E5><U+0001D461>]. We have now clarified that the t_k’s
orted list of the times calculated in equation 3.3. Also, we have corrected a misprint in equation
e upper limit of the sum should be M-1 instead of M.
0/11]: The introductory text of Section 3.4 (“Bounding procedure”) is not quite right in that it
s the introduction of new volume extrema (<0 or >1) as being because “there will inevitably be
rrors, which, in cases where a cell is completely emptied or filled during a time step, will cause
orithm to miss 0 or 1 by a small amount.” The only reason for the over- or under-shoots, on the
ry, is owing to the fact that volumes swept out multi-dimensional (“uns plit) and are not
ted from a true multi-dimensional solenoidal velocity field; rather local approximations are
about the velocity field (solenoidal in a single direc tion) that are incorrect. This issue is
sed, e.g., in a recent 2008 article (SIAM J. SCI. COMPUT, Vol. 31, No. 2, pp. 865–889).
ve removed the word “inevitably” in the sentence by rephrasing:
xplanation for this is that, while the method’s estimate of the <U+0394><U+0001D449><U+0001D457> ’s are typically very good, there
vitably be small errors, which, in cases where a cell is completely emptied or filled during the
ep, will cause the algorithm to miss 0 or 1 by a small amount.”
xplanation for this is that, while the method's estimate of the $\Delta V_j$'s is typically very
t is not exact. Thus, in cases where a cell is completely emptied or filled during the time step, the
rror committed causes the algorithm to miss 0 or 1 by a small amount.”
hat it is not correct that we make the local approximation that the field is “solenoidal in a single
on”.
2]: For error measures, why not just use L1, L2, and L -infinity for all measures? The authors
to use L1 and/or L-infinity for certain cases. Why?
beginning of the Results section (Sec. 4) we define six error measures based on the requirements
OF scheme. In contrast to the error measure collection {L1, L2, L-infinity}, our measures cover
r less everything that can go wrong in a VOF scheme, and by non-dimensionalising them, they
e a geometric interpretation. For instance, E_1 is basically L_1, but non-dimensionalised, so the
re becomes the fraction of the total fluid A contents that is misplaced compared to the exact
n. In our first draft of the manuscript, we had tables for all error measures for all test cases. This
the manuscript too voluminous and difficult to read, and did not provide any essential new
ation. Therefore, we have chosen to show all error measures only for some of the test cases, and
selection of the measures for other cases. The fact that we are making the code and test cases
y available should make it clear, that we are not trying to hide anything by our selection. It is
a matter of clarity in the exposition.
rmance comparison – the authors have chosen to use other algorithms for comparison that
