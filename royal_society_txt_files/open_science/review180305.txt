Geological disasters have always been one of the major challenges for tunnel construction. How
to balance the contradiction between disaster risk control, environmental protection and
construction period, economic cost etc. has always been an important research topic, especially
for developing countries like China, is more important. Therefore, it is very necessary to carry out
systematic and whole process risk analysis within the tunnel construction period. Based on the
above idea, this paper represents a risk assessment model for design stage of a deep buried
tunnel. A fuzzy risk analysis method based on similarity measure is developed for risk
assessment. I enlist some of my main concerns subsequently.
1) The abstract part of the paper is not standardized. The methods and characteristics used in
the paper, the content of the research, and the final findings should be clearly stated in the
abstract.
2) In the introduction, the authors suggest that it is necessary to study risk assessment from the
perspective of decision makers. However, there seems to be no clear explanation of the issue in
the subsequent study of the paper. The authors should clearly explain how to consider the
decision factors in the construction of the proposed risk assessment model.
3) There is an error in the description of the risk analysis method based on similarity measure in
the page 2. In 1984, the fuzzy risk analysis was first proposed by Schmucker[49]. But Wang first
put forward the concept of fuzzy sets’ similarity measure and gave a computation formula.
(P.Z.Wang,Fuzzy sets and its applications, Shanghai Science and Technology Press (1983) (in
Chinese).)
4)The authors mentioned that the existing risk evaluation model based on similarity measures
may lead to the loss of information in the calculation process. It is necessary to make further
explanations for the loss of information.
5) The authors divided the fuzzy risk assessment methods into four categories. In addition to the
several types mentioned in the paper, are there other fuzzy risk assessment models in
geotechnical engineering? If so, can you make a proper description of the relevant model?
6) Figure 6 shows the phenomenon of non English description, which needs to be modified
appropriately.
7) There are some grammatical and spelling errors. The manuscript should be revised
linguistically.

Geological disasters have always been one of the major challenges for
tunnel construction. How to balance the contradiction between disaster risk
control, environmental protection and construction period, economic cost etc.
has always been an important research topic, especially for developing
countries like China, is more important. Therefore, it is very necessary to
carry out systematic and whole process risk analysis within the tunnel
construction period. Based on the above idea, this paper represents a risk
assessment model for design stage of a deep buried tunnel. A fuzzy risk
analysis method based on similarity measure is developed for risk assessment.
I enlist some of my main concerns subsequently.
The first comment and suggestions:
The abstract part of the paper is not standardized. The methods and
characteristics used in the paper, the content of the research, and the final
findings should be clearly stated in the abstract.
Reply to the first comment:
We entirely agree with the reviewer’s opinions. The abstract has been
reorganized and written according to the guidance of the reviewer.
The second comment and suggestions:
In the introduction, the authors suggest that it is necessary to study risk
assessment from the perspective of decision makers. However, there seems to
be no clear explanation of the issue in the subsequent study of the paper. The
authors should clearly explain how to consider the decision factors in the
construction of the proposed risk assessment model.
Reply to second comment:
Decision-makers refer to individuals or groups that could be responsible
for the consequences of decision. For tunnel engineering, risk analysis and
decision-making often belong to different groups. Risk assessment
information is seen an important consideration in the decision-making process,
but it is not the only factor. The risk attitude, work experience and educational
background of decision makers may affect the level of decision-making. In
addition, decision-makers always want to achieve the best risk control effect
under the constraints of limited cost, time and human resources. Therefore, to
better facilitate subsequent decision-making, it is necessary for risk analysts
to consider the influence of decision factors when conducting risk
assessments.
Based on the above ideas, this paper supports the concept that it is
necessary to carry out whole process risk assessment in tunnel engineering. It
can adapt to the characteristics of tunnel construction, and also make full use
of the impact of information supplement on risk assessment to improve the
scientific basis of risk assessment results. Through whole process risk
analysis, the overall idea that grasping the risk of the tunnel and other key
goals can reduce the error of decision-making, improve the utilization of
resources and the efficiency of decision-making. Based on existing research
results, it is necessary to strengthen research on risk assessment at the design
stage, and the corresponding fuzzy risk assessment model is proposed. This
paper presents a related risk assessment research study that fully considers
most of the critical decision-making factors.
The third comment and suggestions:
There is an error in the description of the risk analysis method based on
similarity measure in the page 2. In 1984, the fuzzy risk analysis was first
proposed by Schmucker[49]. But Wang first put forward the concept of fuzzy
sets’ similarity measure and gave a computation formula.
( P.Z.Wang,Fuzzy sets and its applications, Shanghai Science and
Technology Press (1983) (in Chinese).)
Reply to third comment:
We have corrected all the relevant documents and citations in the paper
and apologize for errors presented in the previous version of the manuscript
and would like to thank the reviewer for highlighting their advice.
The fourth comment and suggestions:
The authors mentioned that the existing risk evaluation model based on
similarity measures may lead to the loss of information in the calculation
process. It is necessary to make further explanations for the loss of
information.
Reply to fourth comment:
The most important characteristic of the existing risk assessment model
based on the similarity measures is that it involves the operation between
fuzzy numbers. The formulas between the generalized trapezoidal fuzzy
numbers A and B are as follows.
~ ~
A<U+F0C5> B <U+F03D> (a1 , b1 , c1 , d1 ; w1 ) <U+F0C4> (a2 , b2 , c2 , d 2 ; w2 ) (1)
<U+F03D> (a1 <U+F02B> a2 <U+F02D> a1a2 , b1 <U+F02B> b2 <U+F02D> b1b2 , c1 <U+F02B> c2 <U+F02D> c1c2 , d1 <U+F02B> d 2 <U+F02D> d1d 2 ; min(w1 , w2 ))
~ ~
A<U+F0C4> B <U+F03D> (a1 , b1 , c1 , d1 ; w1 ) <U+F0C4> (a2 , b2 , c2 , d 2 ; w2 ) (2)
<U+F0BB> (a1a2 , b1b2 , c1c2 , d1d 2 ; min(w1 , w2 ))
~ ~
A <U+F0C6>B <U+F03D> (a1 , b1 , c1 , d1 ; w1 ) <U+F0C6> (a2 , b2 , c2 , d 2 ; w2 )
a1 b1 c1 d1 (3)
<U+F0BB>( , , , ; min( w1 , w2 ))
d 2 c2 b2 a2
As seen in Eq. (1), the result remains an exact trapezoidal fuzzy number
for the addition. However, the results of multiplication and division in Eq. (2)
and Eq. (3) are no longer an exact trapezoidal fuzzy number. The results of
multiplication or division as an approximation of a triangular fuzzy number
may be considered to simplify the computation. This kind of fuzzy linear
approximation operation can generate certain deviations and information loss.
For the tunnel project, multiple operations are required with many
factors that influence risk, so errors may accumulate, leading to reduced
reliability of risk assessment results, which may then cause decision error. In
addition, the above formula only involves the operation of linear fuzzy
numbers and in practice nonlinear fuzzy numbers may be encountered which
are more complicated and more likely to cause loss of real information.
Therefore, from the perspective of risk analysis or decision-making, the
existing risk assessment model needs to be further developed.
The fifth comment and suggestions:
The authors divided the fuzzy risk assessment methods into four
categories. In addition to the several types mentioned in the paper, are there
other fuzzy risk assessment models in geotechnical engineering? If so, can
you make a proper description of the relevant model?
Reply to fifth comment:
We would like to thank the reviewer for their useful advice. In
engineering practice, we may also encounter the situation where both random
and fuzzy variables simultaneously exist and the related research results are
mainly concentrated in the field of structural reliability analysis. We have
supplemented this part in the manuscript and marked changes.
The sixth comment and suggestions:
Figure 6 shows the phenomenon of non English description, which needs
to be modified appropriately.
Reply to sixth comment:
We apologize for this and we have revised the Fig. 6 accordingly.
The seventh comment and suggestions:
There are some grammatical and spelling errors. The manuscript should
be revised linguistically.

The conclusion should be extended.
The first comments and suggestions:
The authors used "the improved risk assessment model" instead of " the
proposed risk assessment model. Why and how is the author's model
"improved"?, However, each claim needs some logical supports.
Reply to the first comments:
We fully agree with the reviewer's comments. The conclusions were not
written to a sufficiently high technical standard and had many deficiencies.
These have been revised in the updated version of the manuscript.
The building of tunnel project can be roughly divided into the stages of
investigation, design and construction. The different stages are relatively
independent but closely related to each other. Therefore, to achieve the
expected risk control effect, it is necessary to construct a risk assessment
model according to the characteristics of risk information at different stages,
and to carry out risk analysis based on the whole process.
Although the tunnel engineering risk problem has attracted widespread
attention, different studies have proposed different risk assessment models at
different periods, including probability-based and fuzzy set-based. However,
the related studies mainly focus on the construction period. Compared with
the construction stage, the risk information in the design stage is relatively
scarce and some factors can only be qualitatively judged. Therefore,
considering the actual situation, based on the qualitative risk analysis in the
investigation stage, it is reasonable to perform semi-quantitative risk
assessment in the design stage, which could support quantitative risk analysis
in the construction stage. Fuzzy risk analysis based on similarity measures is a
commonly used semi-quantitative evaluation model, but it has the two main
deficiencies: (1) The operation between fuzzy numbers results in partial
information loss, and (2) the existing similarity measure method is not ideal
for non-linear fuzzy numbers.
To solve the above problems, we proposed an improved formula for
similar measures. To avoid the problem of missing information, we hope that
the constructed model does not involve the operation of fuzzy numbers. Based
on the above analysis, we propose an improved fuzzy risk assessment model
based on similarity measures and evidence theory.
The second comment:
Why the fuzzy risk analysis model is suitable?
Reply to the second comment:
Based on the risk analysis concept of the whole process and the
characteristics of information deficiency, it is feasible to construct a
semi-quantitative risk assessment model in the design stage. The fuzzy risk
analysis model based on similarity measures has its advantages in describing
qualitative language, and fuzzy and uncertain information which has been a
commonly used semi-quantitative evaluation method. Based on the above
reasons, we further propose an improved risk analysis model which is suitable
for the overall purpose of the study.
The third comments and suggestions:
It is required to the authors describe how the proposed model is
functionally better than the conventional techniques by statistical data.
Please do not use language statements insyead of statistical data to
support the claims.
Reply to the third comments:
Thank you very much for the advice given by the reviewer. Tunnel
engineering belongs to complex system engineering, and there are many
factors that influence risk which include geological uncertainty. In the design
stage, some impact factors may not be evaluated by traditional statistical data.
For example, the evaluation of unfavorable geology as there is no more
accurate geological information such as karst development and fracture
distribution, can only be qualitatively described by words such as “worse”,
“poor” and “good”. However, according to the conversion relationship
between qualitative language and fuzzy numbers, qualitative language can be
quantified and then the fuzzy risk analysis model can be constructed.
Due to the fuzzy number closer to the actual situation than the traditional
probability method which includes data statistics, its application in tunnel and
underground engineering is more extensive.
