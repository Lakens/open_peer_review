Fast and large-scale chemical preparation is very important for chemistry, material science, and
other fields. In this manuscript, Tao et al. develop a supersonic gas flow method for preparation
of ultrafine silicon powders and mechanochemical synthesis. They not only theoretically design
the equipment, but also successfully fabricate the equipment. What is more, the developed
equipment is used to prepare ultrafine silicon powders and TiN compounds. This work is very
interesting, novel, and significant because it solves the drawbacks of traditional
mechanochemical instruments in terms of production speed, energy transformation, and sample
separation, which may promote the development of mechanochemisty. I recommend acceptance
of this manuscript after minor revision.
Detail comments:
1. To further the novelty of this work, the reference numbers should be added.
2. The Figures should be amplified to make them more clear.

The manuscript describes a method for physical preparation of ultrafine silicon powders and
chemical synthesis of TiO2 /TiNx nanopowders based on supersonic gas flow. This work
involves the theoretical design, fabrication, and application of the supersonic gas flow
instrument. The speed of supersonic gas flow achieves as much as 550 m/s, which is quite
advantageous for chemical preparations. The developed equipment and method effectively

overcomes the drawbacks of traditional mechanochemical synthesis such as hand grinding and
mechanical ball in in terms of preparation speed, synthesis scale, sample contamination, and
reaction yield. Therefore, this work is very interesting, and important because it provides a new
avenue for mechanochemical synthesis, which may promote the development of solid-state
chemical preparation. Based on these considerations, I recommend acceptance of this manuscript
after minor revision.
1. The background descriptions in the introduction should be more comprehensive, and some
references should be added.
2. The physical parameters of the compressed air should be given.
3. The names of various instruments should be shown.

synthesis
Manuscript ID: RSOS-181432
Thank you for submitting the above manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. On behalf of the
Editors and the Royal Society of Chemistry, I am pleased to inform you that your manuscript will
be accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science subject to minor revision in accordance
with the referee suggestions. Please find the reviewers' comments at the end of this email.
The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript before 27-Sep-2018. Please note that the revision deadline
will expire at 00.00am on this date. If you do not think you will be able to meet this date please let
me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
4
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.
