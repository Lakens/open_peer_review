This paper examines the behavioural response of rats (male and female) in a novel environment.
Each rats is exposed to the environment on three separate occasions, with predator odour being
present in the second exposure only.
Major concerns: (eg L283) – it is unclear why this behaviour represents a cognitive style or what,
exactly, a cognitive style is or what it would look like, behaviourally, if an animal had a cognitive
style versus no cognitive style. My understanding is that multiple cognitive abilities, or aspects of
the same cognitive ability (for example speed of acquisition versus accuracy of choices) need to be
measured, at the individual level, for cognitive styles to be assessed. This paper did not look at
either. I don’t think that the novel environment tested a cognitive ability and they did not analyse
things at the level of the individual as they claim (eg L376). Cognitive style is defined in the
caption for Fig 1, but this definition is Shettlewoth’s definition for cognition not cognitive style.
Especially because there are contradictions in the literature about which sex is more exploratory
in rats (L387) it may have been useful to have a control group of animals that experienced the
novel environment 3x without ever being exposed to predator odour. This would tell us about
differences (or lack thereof) between male and female rats in habituation (and therefore
behavioural responses) over time in the novel environment. Differences in behaviour may be
attributed to male rats habituating more quickly to the novel environment, compared to females.
I find it difficult to interpret the current data without this control.
Minor comments:
L43 A hallmark of animal personality is not only that animals are consistent, but also that their
behaviour differs from one another.
L 46 How is ‘sensitive to external cues’ different from ‘personal experience’? Please clarify
L 72 I would agree that being more explorative means that animals may come in contact with to-
be-learned stimuli more quickly, which is not the same as learning more quickly. It is unclear
why explorative, risk-prone individuals would learn more quickly, and this is one of the big
questions that the field of personality and cognition is trying to address.
Paragraph L 90 Nice inclusion of the medical literature which is often overlooked.
L110 The rats also had the opportunity that the area was safe.
L139 How big is this normal housing cage compared to the novel environment?
L171 Unclear what happened here with the randomization of testing order? Did some animals get
both no odour trials before the odour trial?

The authors describe a study where they have utilised a modified version of the open field arena
to study male and female rats responses to novelty and predatory odour. They also test the
animals after exposure to the predatory odour to assess the impact of prior experience on
subsequent behaviour i.e. adaptation. The work has been structured in this way to try to address
some of the conflicting data currently present in the literature when sex differences have not been
consistent. Whilst the approach used is appropriate overall, I am not convinced by the use of the
term ‘cognitive style’ within this experimental design. I think that the interpretation of these data
should be restricted to what the authors are measuring – anxiety and/or fear-related behaviour. I
am not convinced by the subsequent evaluation of these data in the broader cognitive domains.
To me these would imply that the behaviour of the animals is involving more complex decision-
making processes which, based on the data presented may or may not be involved. My
interpretation of the data would be based on what the experiment has measured - fear-anxiety
and maybe fear-conditioning/associative learning. A brief explanation of this to risk-related
behaviour would be appropriate in the subsequent discussion but I think a more conservative
introduction to what the experiment will test and interpretation of the data would be more
appropriate.
Other points:
The introduction seems somewhat long and could be more concise and focussed towards the
specific study described.
Was any assessment of the female oestrus cycle made? Were all females tested on the same day
in their cycle and was the same day of the cycle used for each test session?
Could the authors include the weight data for the animals? Presumably the males and females
were quite different in size by the age they were tested? Would this impact on behaviours
recorded in the test e.g. head-out, the hide box is described as 14 cm × 14 cm × 12 cm which
seems quite small given the size of a rat.
I am not sure that the figure 1 ‘A general hypothesis’ is appropriate for this publication. The
original research work contained in the publication is not testing all the different elements shown
in this figure.

Comments to the Author:
The expert reviewers agreed that this is a worthwhile piece of work, but that the term "cognitive
style" (which appears throughout the manuscript, and in the title) was hard to justify on the basis
of the reported results, and indeed poorly defined (one noted that the definition provided is for
"cognition" not "cognitive style").
I agree with them that although the experimental work is broadly sound, in its current form the
manuscript is not acceptable because of this over-interpretation of the data. If the introduction
and discussion were thoroughly rewritten, focusing away from cognitive style, and instead
providing a more restricted interpretation and conservative introduction, the manuscript has the
potential to be acceptable.
Reviewer 1 also recommends the inclusion of additional control data, which would test for sex
differences in a novel environment in the absence of the predator odour. I agree with the
reviewer that as currently conducted this experiment is hard to interpret because of the confound
between novelty/habituation and threat. If the authors feel that this is unnecessary they should
provide a clear explanation in their resubmission.

label_comment_3
In this revision the authors have gone a long way towards addressing my initial concerns, but I
feel they still have a little way to go. Although they have removed the majority of the discussion
about cognitive styles, it still appears as keyword and in the abstract. Especially in the abstract
where cognitive style and personality types are linked, neither one of which is examined in the
current work.
Following this, the term exploratory behaviour appears only twice in the manuscript (lines 89
and 314). If the authors want to use this term, it needs to both be defined in terms of the literature
and how it was measured in the current experiment.
The open field (L134) is scarcely larger than the home cage (117). How does this compare to other
open field tests used to assess rats risk taking? Please include justification in manuscript.
L206 Why use spearman rank when looking for behavioural changes when you have the actual
data (time) across open filed test 2 and 3?
I appreciate the inclusion of the movement data for open field test 1 but I am not sure this goes
the distance in controlling for potential different in habituation to the open field test. Related to
movement: (L314) does exploratory behaviour = time out of cover? Please be specific as
7
exploratory behaviour has not yet been defined in this manuscript. e.g., what if the rat was out of
cover, but not moving around the cage. Would this be exploratory behaviour?
L270 - I think having control groups that were never exposed to predator odour in 3x open field
would make the results easier to interpret.
L310-it would also be that the females forgot, or didn’t form an association between the US and
the CS (context, because of CS preexposure effect), the females had already learned that the
context was non harmful, and thus failed to update from the first open field treatment. These
options should also be discussed. The behavioural response in the 2nd open field test is not
necessarily indicative that the females learned to associate the odour with the context.

The authors have carefully revised their manuscript and addressed the majority of my concerns.
I do think that the paper would benefit from a much clearer paragraph which draws together the
limitations of the work. This should include the lack of data on oestrus cycle and the lack of
control for repeated testing in the same arena over time. The addition of the data for the
habituation within a session should also include repeated measures statistical analysis to show
their are no sex differences.

The authors have taken the concerns of the reviewers seriously and substantially revised the
manuscript. However, the reviewers still have a few concerns that need to be addressed prior to
publication. In particular I agree with Reviewer 1's suggestion to include a limitations paragraph,
as well as the statistical concerns of both reviewers. I appreciate that the authors would prefer not
to collect additional control data at this stage, but they should try to address Reviewer 2's concern
in this regard nonetheless.

With regard to the response letter, there are a couple of points which I think need to be
considered further.
1. There is a significant difference reported for the habituation data which shows that the
responses of males and females differ but this is not incorporated into the discussion or
11
limitations. The statistics reported in the figure legend (S2) are also not clear. Was their a main
effect of sex and/or sex*time interaction?
2. The justification for not including the habituation control was made on the basis that this
would increase the numbers of animals used and this would not be in line with the 3Rs. I think
care must be taken when making such an argument. The lack of a control group for habituation
has meant that it is not possible to determine whether these data are a product of habituation or a
specific effect of the predator odour and as such, the value of the whole experiment has been
reduced.
3. The open field arena for rats which is widely used in anxiety studies in normally ~100cm
square and therefore is substantially larger than the testing apparatus used here.
3. The term cognitive style is still in the abstract and referred to in several different places the text.
4. The keywords now refers to 'coping style' which is similarly unclear.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Jonathan Roiser):
Editor's note: One of the reviewers still has major concerns about the manuscript (some of which
have only come to light during the review process), and feels that substantial revisions are still
required. In particular the reviewer feels that the conclusions go substantially beyond what the
data allow, given the limitations in the experiment. In order for us to consider a resubmission all
of these comments must be addressed in full, specifically:
1) Noting the gender difference in habituation in the discussion, which is an important caveat
2) Changing the discussion relating to the 3Rs
3) Acknowledging that the open field test apparatus used is non-standard, limiting the
comparision of the results to other studies, and the conclusions that can be drawn
4) Removing all unwarranted terms (objected to by both reviewers) from the manuscript - i.e.
"cognitive style", "coping style" etc
Specific comments from the reviewer appear below:
1. There is a significant difference reported for the habituation data which shows that the
responses of males and females differ but this is not incorporated into the discussion or
limitations. The statistics reported in the figure legend (S2) are also not clear. Was there a main
effect of sex and/or sex*time interaction?
2. The justification for not including the habituation control was made on the basis that this

care must be taken when making such an argument. The lack of a control group for habituation
has meant that it is not possible to determine whether these data are a product of habituation or a
specific effect of the predator odour and as such, the value of the whole experiment has been
reduced.

Abstract: In many species, males tend to have lower parental investment than females and
greater variance in their reproductive success. Males might therefore be expected to adopt more
high-risk, high-return behaviours than females. Next to risk-taking behaviour, sexes might also
differ in how they respond to information and learn new associations due to the fundamental link
of these cognitive processes with the risk-reward axis. Here we investigated sex differences in
both risk-taking and learned responses to risk by repeatedly subjecting male and female rats
(Rattus norvegicus) to an open field test containing cover. We found that males explored more
than females when first placed in the open field and the environment was novel to them. Males
14
also hid less when exposed to the test arena containing predator odour. In contrast, females
explored more than males when the predator odour was removed (associatively-learned risk).
These results suggest that males are more risk-prone but behave more in line with previous
experiences, while females are more risk-averse and more responsive to changes in their current
environment. These sex differences in risk-taking and learning are in line with recent research
that links personality types with individuals’ cognitive style, highlighting that a general link may
exist between risk-taking behaviour and style of learning.

Abstract: In many species, males tend to have lower parental investment than females and
greater variance in their reproductive success. Males might therefore be expected to adopt more
high-risk, high-return behaviours than females. Next to risk-taking behaviour itself, sexes might
also differ in how they respond to information and learn new associations due to the
fundamental link of these cognitive processes with the risk-reward axis. Here we investigated sex
differences in both risk-taking and learned responses to risk by measuring male and female rats’
(Rattus norvegicus) behaviour across three contexts in an open-field test containing cover. We
found that when the environment was novel, males spent more time out of cover than females.
Males also hid less when exposed to the test arena containing predator odour. In contrast,
females explored more than males when the predator odour was removed (associatively-learned
risk). These results suggest that males are more risk-prone but behave more in line with previous
experiences, while females are more risk-averse and more responsive to changes in their current
environment. Our results suggest that male and female rats differ in how they cope with risk and
highlight that a general link may exist between risk-taking behaviour and learning style.

Appendix A
We thank the Reviewers and Editor for their helpful and thorough feedback on our
manuscript and have now considerably revised it according to their suggestions. Our detailed
responses to the Editor’s and Reviewers’ comments (in bold) are listed below (in italics).
Jolle Jolles, Neeltje Boogert, Ruud van den Bos
Associate Editor Comments to Author:
The expert reviewers agreed that this is a worthwhile piece of work, but that the term
"cognitive style" (which appears throughout the manuscript, and in the title) was hard
to justify on the basis of the reported results, and indeed poorly defined (one noted that
the definition provided is for "cognition" not "cognitive style"). I agree with them that
although the experimental work is broadly sound, in its current form the manuscript is
not acceptable because of this over-interpretation of the data. If the introduction and
discussion were thoroughly rewritten, focusing away from cognitive style, and instead
providing a more restricted interpretation and conservative introduction, the
manuscript has the potential to be acceptable.
>> We thank the Editor and two Reviewers for their constructive feedback. We used
“cognitive style” to refer to the way individuals process, store or act on information,
independent of cognitive ability, using the exact definition of Sih & Del Giudice (2012, Phil
Trans Roy Soc B 367: 2762-2772) (provided in the first paragraph of the original
manuscript). However, we agree that our introduction and discussion might have been too
broad and could be seen as over-interpreting our results. We have now considerably changed
the manuscript following the Editor’s and Reviewers’ comments: 1) We have changed the
title, removing “cognitive style”; 2) We have rewritten most of the abstract to make it more
conservative; 3) We have removed the sections about personality differences and cognitive
styles completely from the introduction to make it more restricted and focused on the data we
collected. We have also reorganized its structure to make it more concise (~25% shorter), in
line with the comment of the second Reviewer; 4) We have removed Figure 1, which
illustrated a hypothetical framework for understanding sex differences, in line with the
request to make the manuscript more focused to the data we collected; 5) We have
considerably rewritten the discussion to make it clearer and less speculative. We discuss the
results of the novel context and predator odour context in terms of risk-taking behaviour and
the results of the conditioned context in terms of learned responses to risk. Only at the very
end of the discussion do we briefly mention the personality literature linking personality
types to cognitive styles, making the definition of cognitive style very clear (lines 335-338); 6)
We clarify throughout the manuscript that we are interested in differences in risk-taking and
learning responses to risk (see e.g. lines 61-68; 84-87; 266-268; 300-302; 343-345) as both
are predicted to be related to risk-reward trade-offs.
Reviewer 1 also recommends the inclusion of additional control data, which would test
for sex differences in a novel environment in the absence of the predator odour. I agree
with the reviewer that as currently conducted this experiment is hard to interpret
because of the confound between novelty/habituation and threat. If the authors feel that
this is unnecessary they should provide a clear explanation in their resubmission.
>> We agree that understanding sex differences in habituation is an important topic, but we
do not think they play an important role in our results. We used the same experimental
paradigm as numerous previous studies focused on the role of cat odour (as was stated in
lines 149-151 and 165-166) that use the first of the three sessions as a “familiarization”
stage. We were not specifically interested in habituation to the open field arena, and used the
first exposure to the (novel) open field arena to look at changes in exploratory and hiding
behaviour due to the presence of predator odour and its subsequent removal. We have now
added an additional Figure (S2) to the Supplementary Materials, which shows the test arena
habituation curve for both sexes. This graph demonstrates that the drop in activity was very
similar for males and females. This supports other work focused on sex differences in
habituation in rats (e.g. Dubovický et al., 1999; Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior;
Ribiero et al., 2010, Brain & Cognition) that suggests habituation to an open field to be very
similar in males and females. We now discuss the potential effect of habituation in the
discussion (lines 278-281). Given this lack of evidence for sex differences in habituation to
open field tests, we believe that using the additional number of animals that would have been
required for a control group was not warranted, especially with the three R’s of animal
welfare in mind (see NC3Rs.org.uk).
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
This paper examines the behavioural response of rats (male and female) in a novel
environment. Each rat is exposed to the environment on three separate occasions, with
predator odour being present in the second exposure only.
Major concerns: (eg L283) – it is unclear why this behaviour represents a cognitive style
or what, exactly, a cognitive style is or what it would look like, behaviourally, if an
animal had a cognitive style versus no cognitive style. My understanding is that multiple
cognitive abilities, or aspects of the same cognitive ability (for example speed of
acquisition versus accuracy of choices) need to be measured, at the individual level, for
cognitive styles to be assessed. This paper did not look at either. I don’t think that the
novel environment tested a cognitive ability and they did not analyse things at the level
of the individual as they claim (eg L376). Cognitive style is defined in the caption for Fig
1, but this definition is Shettlewoth’s definition for cognition not cognitive style.
>> Please see our detailed response above. We have now completely rewritten most of the
manuscript (title, abstract, introduction, discussion), moving away almost entirely from using
“cognitive style” (except for the very end of the discussion) to make the manuscript more
focused on, and restricted to, the data we actually collected. We now describe sex differences
in risk-taking and associative learning related to risk. Note that we have also removed Figure
1, which illustrated a hypothetical framework for understanding sex differences, to improve
the focus of the manuscript. Regarding the latter points of this comment, we would like to
clarify that we only refer to potential sex differences in information processing related to the
contrasting sex differences in the context of associatively-learned risk, and that we are not
addressing such relationships at the individual level. We have now re-written the
introduction and the final paragraph to clarify this.
Especially because there are contradictions in the literature about which sex is more
exploratory in rats (L387) it may have been useful to have a control group of animals
that experienced the novel environment 3x without ever being exposed to predator
odour. This would tell us about differences (or lack thereof) between male and female
rats in habituation (and therefore behavioural responses) over time in the novel
environment. Differences in behaviour may be attributed to male rats habituating more
quickly to the novel environment, compared to females. I find it difficult to interpret the
current data without this control.
>> We addressed this in our response to the Editor’s comment that refers to this point by the
Reviewer, please see above.
Minor comments:
L43 A hallmark of animal personality is not only that animals are consistent, but also
that their behaviour differs from one another.
L 46 How is ‘sensitive to external cues’ different from ‘personal experience’? Please
clarify
>> We agree and realized that although we mentioned behavioural variability in the
preceding line it was omitted in this sentence. Furthermore, “being more sensitive to external
cues” was meant to be the opposite of “being driven more by personal experience” (stated
on the preceding line). However, this paragraph has now been completely removed from the
revised manuscript, following the Editor’s and Reviewers’ suggestions.
L 72 I would agree that being more explorative means that animals may come in contact
with to-be-learned stimuli more quickly, which is not the same as learning more
quickly. It is unclear why explorative, risk-prone individuals would learn more quickly,
and this is one of the big questions that the field of personality and cognition is trying to
address.
>> We agree that more exploratory individuals may come in contact with to-be-learned
stimuli more quickly, as the reviewer states. As a result, those individuals may also learn
more quickly about their environment, irrespective of cognitive ability. We have rewritten
this sentence to clarify this (lines 68-72).
Paragraph L 90 Nice inclusion of the medical literature, which is often overlooked.
>> We thank the reviewer for their positive comment.
L110 The rats also had the opportunity that the area was safe.
>> We do not fully understand what the reviewer is referring to with their comment.
Although there was no real predatory risk throughout the test, the environment was novel for
the first exposure and subsequently contained the odour of a predator, which may suggest a
predator is near or had been near. The rats could therefore not be certain of risk levels in the
area and had to explore it to know the area was relatively safe. We have rewritten the
sentence and made the levels of risk clearer (lines 87-90).
L139 How big is this normal housing cage compared to the novel environment?
>> The housing cage dimensions were 590 mm long, 380 mm wide and 200mm high, but
with a restricted movement area of ~ 350 × 380 × 170mm for the two rats in each cage, due
to the sawdust bedding floor (height ~ 30mm) and the metal grid roof that protruded
downwards for 260mm to 50mm at its lowest point to serve as a food reservoir. Note that at
this height rats are not able to fully raise themselves and that the housing and testing
environment were very different, both in terms of the presence of bedding, cardboard tubes
and tissues, the low metal roof, and the different dimensions of the movement area. We have
now clarified the dimensions of the housing cage on lines 116-117 and included a figure of
the testing arena (S1) in the supplementary material.
L171 Unclear what happened here with the randomization of testing order? Did some
animals get both no odour trials before the odour trial?
>> We apologize for not being clear. What we meant is that, each day, rats were randomly
allocated to one of the three identical arenas (see line 150 of the original manuscript) and
that the testing order was random. We have now rewritten the sentence to make this clear
(lines 153-154).
Reviewer: 2
The authors describe a study where they have utilised a modified version of the open
field arena to study male and female rats responses to novelty and predatory
odour. They also test the animals after exposure to the predatory odour to assess the
impact of prior experience on subsequent behaviour i.e. adaptation. The work has been
structured in this way to try to address some of the conflicting data currently present in
the literature when sex differences have not been consistent.
Whilst the approach used is appropriate overall, I am not convinced by the use of the
term ‘cognitive style’ within this experimental design. I think that the interpretation of
these data should be restricted to what the authors are measuring – anxiety and/or fear-
related behaviour. I am not convinced by the subsequent evaluation of these data in the
broader cognitive domains. To me these would imply that the behaviour of the animals
is involving more complex decision-making processes which, based on the data
presented may or may not be involved. My interpretation of the data would be based
on what the experiment has measured - fear-anxiety and maybe fear-
conditioning/associative learning. A brief explanation of this to risk-related behaviour
would be appropriate in the subsequent discussion but I think a more conservative
introduction to what the experiment will test and interpretation of the data would be
more appropriate.
>> We have now considerably changed the manuscript to focus away from cognitive style,
make it more conservative to the data we collected, and make our interpretations more
restricted. For further details, please see our response to the Editor’s and the first
Reviewer’s comment above. In short, we have changed the title, have completely rewritten
the abstract and introduction, removing the sections referring to cognitive styles, and made
the discussion more restrictive, discussing the results of the novel context and predator odour
context in terms of risk-taking behaviour and the results of the conditioned context in terms of
learned responses to risk. We have restricted any reference to cognitive styles to the very end
of the discussion, where it is mentioned only very briefly.
Other points:
The introduction seems somewhat long and could be more concise and focused towards
the specific study described.
>> We have considerably rewritten the abstract, introduction, and discussion in line with the
Editor and both Reviewers’ feedback to make it more concise and focused on the data we
collected. The introduction of the revised manuscript is ca. 25% shorter than the original
introduction.
Was any assessment of the female oestrus cycle made? Were all females tested on the
same day in their cycle and was the same day of the cycle used for each test session?
>> We did not assess females’ oestrous and therefore do not have information about the
stage of oestrous cycle female rats were in. However, previous studies suggest that Norway
rats do not synchronize their oestrous cycle (see e.g. Schank, 2001, Physiol. & Behav. and
discussion therein). The females in our study are therefore expected to be at randomly
different stages of their cycle during the tests. If the oestrous cycle would play a large role in
the findings of our study, one would expect the behaviour of females to be more variable
between subjects than the variability observed between males (see Hughes, 2007, Behav.
Pharmacol.). However, examining the variability in behaviour we did not find females to be
more variable. We therefore argue that, similar to other studies (e.g. Berry et al., 1997,
Behav Neurosci; Stock et al., 2000, Psychopharm), the sex differences observed in our study
are not strongly linked to females’ oestrous cycle. We now discuss this in the methods on
lines 124-128.
Could the authors include the weight data for the animals? Presumably the males and
females were quite different in size by the age they were tested? Would this impact on
behaviours recorded in the test e.g. head-out, the hide box is described as 14 cm × 14 cm
× 12 cm which seems quite small given the size of a rat.
>> The body weight of males and females was indeed considerably different by the age they
were tested (male average: 334.5 gr, range: 316-355gr; female average: 230.5 gr, range:
216-245gr). As we were interested in overall sex differences (not specifically in individual
differences) and because of the very strong collinearity between sex and body size, the latter
was not a focus of our analyses. Nevertheless, including weight in our models revealed body
size to not have any significant effects. The hide box we used was the standard provided by
Noldus for adult rats of both sexes and did not restrict the rat’s behaviour in any way
(personal observations). We have now included descriptive data on sex differences in body
weight in the methods (lines 120-121) and explain that weight did not have any significant
effects on the behavioural responses measured (lines 211-212).
I am not sure that the figure 1 ‘A general hypothesis’ is appropriate for this
publication. The original research work contained in the publication is not testing all
the different elements shown in this figure.
>> The figure was intended to illustrate the framework we discuss in our manuscript and to
serve as a guide for future research. We have decided to remove the figure, in line with the
Reviewer’s suggestion, as now the manuscript is more restricted and focused on the data we
collected.
Appendix B
Dear Editor,
As encouraged by your response, we hereby submit a revised version of our
manuscript RSOS-150293, “Sex differences in risk-taking and associative learning in
rats”. We thank the Editor and reviewers for the in-depth feedback and have now
carefully incorporated the requested information in the revised manuscript. Please
find the original comments in bold with our responses added in italics below.
Sincerely,
Jolle W. Jolles, Neeltje J. Boogert and Ruud van den Bos
Associate Editor's comments
The authors have taken the concerns of the reviewers seriously and substantially
revised the manuscript. However, the reviewers still have a few concerns that
need to be addressed prior to publication. In particular I agree with Reviewer 1's
suggestion to include a limitations paragraph, as well as the statistical concerns
of both reviewers. I appreciate that the authors would prefer not to collect
additional control data at this stage, but they should try to address Reviewer 2's
concern in this regard nonetheless.
>> We have now included a limitations paragraph to the discussion (lines 325-340)
and incorporated the reviewers’ statistical concerns (lines 197-199, 269-273, Figure
S2 caption).
Reviewer #1 Comments to the Authors:
In this revision the authors have gone a long way towards addressing my initial
concerns, but I feel they still have a little way to go. Although they have removed
the majority of the discussion about cognitive styles, it still appears as keyword
and in the abstract. Especially in the abstract where cognitive style and
personality types are linked, neither one of which is examined in the current
work.
>> We have now removed cognitive style from the keywords and the abstract. We
would like to highlight that all we say in the abstract is that our results on sex
differences are in line with research that links personality types and cognitive styles
and thus do not proclaim that we look at either personality or cognitive style. We
have now rewritten the sentence in the abstract (lines 29-30) to make this clearer.
Following this, the term exploratory behaviour appears only twice in the
manuscript (lines 89 and 314). If the authors want to use this term, it needs to
both be defined in terms of the literature and how it was measured in the current
experiment.
>> We apologize for not being clear. With exploratory behaviour we simply refer to
rats spending time out of cover. We now added a line to the methods to clarify this
(lines 163-164) and have removed the term from lines 89-90.
The open field (L134) is scarcely larger than the home cage (117). How does this
compare to other open field tests used to assess rats risk taking? Please include
justification in manuscript.
>> In terms of surface area, the open field test is >1.5 times bigger than the home
cage. Furthermore the home cage housed two individuals and had a very low roof
(lines 117-120), thus containing an even smaller actual movement area for each
individual. The open-field test does generally not utilize a ‘field’ in the true sense of a
wide, expansive area, where an animal can move and behave unrestrained, but rather
an arena (Gould et al., 2009), as in our study. Furthermore, overall activity patterns
have been shown to be relatively stable across open field sizes (see Gould, Dao &
Kovacsics, 2009 for a review). Nevertheless, we have included a new paragraph with
limitations (lines 325-340) and included a statement about the limited size of the
experimental arena and need for future studies to assess risk-related behaviour in
larger, more natural environments (lines 337-340).
L206 Why use spearman rank when looking for behavioural changes when you
have the actual data (time) across open filed test 2 and 3?
>> We used spearman rank tests as the most robust way to investigate if either the
time individuals spent out of cover or in head-out during the second session could
explain the time they spent out of cover during the third session. We have rewritten
these sentences in the discussion to make this clear (lines 197-199).
I appreciate the inclusion of the movement data for open field test 1 but I am not
sure this goes the distance in controlling for potential different in habituation to
the open field test.
>> We would like to highlight again that our experimental paradigm was based on
that used by a whole range of studies focused on investigating the role of cat odour
(see Dielenberg et al., 2001, Neurosci & Biobehav Rev). A large body of experimental
work uses this paradigm whereby rats are tested during a 20-min familiarisation
stage a day before being tested in the context of cat odour. Quoting Dielenberg et al
(2001): “[The] familiarisation [stage] refers to a 20 min habituation session given to
all rats in the apparatus in the absence of any odour stimulus”. As we used the exact
same experimental paradigm (20min novel open field test session followed 24h later
by a 20min cat odour session) with the same species, habituation effects are not
expected have any major effects. This is supported by figure S2 included in the
supplementary material that shows a clear habituation curve for both males and
females, with similar activity levels during the latter half of the first session, now
statistically described in the figure caption. We now clarify this further on lines 268-
273-316. Furthermore, we added a line to the introduction to make clear that the
experimental paradigm we used with the three different sessions is based on the large
body of experimental work focused on investigating effects of cat odour on rat
behaviour (lines 96-98). Finally, we included a sentence in the discussion that future
studies could use a control group to further disentangle habituation effects from
observed responses (lines 333-337).
Related to movement: (L314) does exploratory behaviour = time out of cover?
Please be specific as exploratory behaviour has not yet been defined in this
manuscript. e.g., what if the rat was out of cover, but not moving around the
cage. Would this be exploratory behaviour?
>> We apologize for not being clear about this. With exploratory behaviour we
simply refer to rats spending time out of cover. We now added a line to the methods to
clarify this (lines 163-164) and removed the term from lines 89-90.
L270 - I think having control groups that were never exposed to predator odour
in 3x open field would make the results easier to interpret.
>> We agree that having additional control groups of males and females would have
made it easier to disentangle effects of the cat odour and related associative learning
from potential (though unlikely) effects of habituation. However, as the suggested
control groups would have required an additional 30 animals of each sex, including
the control groups was not warranted in compliance with the principles of
replacement, reduction and refinement (Buchanan et al., 2012, Guidelines for the use
of animals): “any experiment should use the minimum number of animals necessary
to test the hypotheses, without the loss of scientific rigour”. We have now added a
statement about this in the discussion (lines 333-336) and added a sentence for the
need of future work to further disentangle habituation effects from observed responses
in our study (lines 336-337).
L310-it would also be that the females forgot, or didn’t form an association
between the US and the CS (context, because of CS preexposure effect), the
females had already learned that the context was non harmful, and thus failed to
update from the first open field treatment. These options should also be
discussed. The behavioural response in the 2nd open field test is not necessarily
indicative that the females learned to associate the odour with the context.
>> We now added a couple lines to the discussion explaining that the stronger
conditioned responses of males could be the result of either males being more affected
by their former experiences than females, or alternatively that females did not form as
strong an association between the cat odour and the context as males (lines 301-303).
There is no reason to suspect that females learned that the context was non-harmful,
based on their stronger hiding behaviour during both the first and second exposure.
Furthermore, from their reduced responses during the third compared to second
session it is clear that both males and females showed conditioned responses. We
refer to this in the discussion (e.g. on lines 294-297) and discuss our findings in the
context of the literature on sex differences in association learning and conditioning
(lines 306-315). We would like to highlight again (see above) that we used the same
experimental paradigm that has been shown repeatedly to result in robust conditioned
responses (see e.g. Dielenberg et al., 2001, Brain Research; Blanchard et al., 2001,
Neurosci & Biobehav Rev; Staples, 2010, Neurobio Learn & Mem for reviews). We
added a line to the introduction to clarify this further (lines 96-98).
Reviewer #2 Comments to Authors:
The authors have carefully revised their manuscript and addressed the majority
of my concerns. I do think that the paper would benefit from a much clearer
paragraph which draws together the limitations of the work. This should include
the lack of data on oestrus cycle and the lack of control for repeated testing in
the same arena over time.
>> We added a whole new paragraph in the discussion to discuss the potential
limitations of our work (lines 325-340).
The addition of the data for the habituation within a session should also include
repeated measures statistical analysis to show there are no sex differences.
>> We now report the statistics from linear-mixed models comparing males’ and
females’ activity across the session in the supplementary material (caption of Figure
S2). Although females showed initial higher activity, both sexes showed a habituation
curve with similar levels of activity during the last 10min of the session. We have
further clarified this on lines 268-273 of the discussion and included a sentence in the
discussion that future studies could use a control group to further disentangle
habituation effects from observed responses (lines 333-337).
Appendix C
Dear Editor,
We hereby resubmit the manuscript entitled “Sex differences in risk-taking and associative
learning in rats” by J.W. Jolles, N.J. Boogert and R. van den Bos (MS #RSOS-150293.R1).
We comply with the five points raised by referee 2. The manuscript was changed accordingly
and we hope that our adaptations make the paper acceptable for publication.
Sincerely,
Jolle W. Jolles, Neeltje J. Boogert and Ruud van den Bos
Reviewer #2: With regard to the response letter, there are a couple of points which I
think need to be considered further.
Editor's note: One of the reviewers still has major concerns about the manuscript (some
of which have only come to light during the review process), and feels that substantial
revisions are still required. In particular the reviewer feels that the conclusions go
substantially beyond what the data allow, given the limitations in the experiment. In
order for us to consider a resubmission all of these (four) comments must be addressed
in full.
Comments
Reviewer #2: 1) There is a significant difference reported for the habituation data which
shows that the responses of males and females differ but this is not incorporated into the
discussion or limitations. The statistics reported in the figure legend (S2) are also not
clear. Was their a main effect of sex and/or sex*time interaction?; 2) The justification
for not including the habituation control was made on the basis that this would increase
the numbers of animals used and this would not be in line with the 3Rs. I think care
must be taken when making such an argument. The lack of a control group for
habituation has meant that it is not possible to determine whether these data are a
product of habituation or a specific effect of the predator odour and as such, the value
of the whole experiment has been reduced.
Based on this the Editor requests: 1) Noting the gender difference in habituation in the
discussion, which is an important caveat; 2) Changing the discussion relating to the 3Rs.
Both these remarks boil down to the same point about the possibility that sex differences in
habituation may play a role in explaining the sex differences in the latter sessions. However,
our data suggest that this is highly unlikely. We have four arguments to support this notion:
1. Our experimental paradigm was based on that used by a range of studies to
investigate cat odour effects (see refs lines 89-90) that actually used the ‘novel
context’ session to control for habituation effects (using a similar-length session in a
similarly-sized arena as in our study).
2. Figure S2 in the supplementary materials shows that the activity of both males and
females diminished over time, levelling off towards the end of the session, a pattern
that fits the classical habituation curve.
3. This was supported by statistical analyses, which showed that inclusion of a
polynomial term for time in a LMM looking at change of activity over time,
significantly improved its fit (<U+03C7>22 = 44.81; p < 0.001).
4. Although there was a sex*time interaction (<U+03C7>22 = 10.69; p = 0.005), with females
decreasing more in activity early on in the trial, this was due to females being slightly
(R2 = 0.04) more active during the first 10 min of the trial (t118 = 2.50, P = 0.014, but
had similar activity as males in the final half of the novel context trial (t118 = 0.45, p
= 0.652; R 2 = 0.00).
These data thus show that
1. Both males and females show habituation across the novel context session,
2. males and females do not differ in their levels of habituation by the end of the
session,
3. sex differences in the predator odour context and conditioned context are
therefore unlikely to be due to a sex difference in habituation, and
4. a control group is therefore not warranted.
The referee is right in pointing out that this important point should be clarified. We have
therefore adapted the manuscript and included the results on habituation in the manuscript
(lines 172-175, 204-210). In addition, we have redrawn Figure S2 to show trend lines for
both sexes, based on our mixed model analysis. Third, we now dedicate a whole new section
in the discussion to the potential habituation effect (lines 314-330). Fourth and finally, we
are also referring to the 3Rs as requested by the editor (note that the reviewer was referring
to the response letter rather than the manuscript, in which the 3Rs were not described).
Reviewer #2: 3) The open field arena for rats which is widely used in anxiety studies in
normally ~100cm square and therefore is substantially larger than the testing apparatus
used here.
Based on this the Editor requests: 3) Acknowledging that the open field test apparatus
used is non-standard, limiting the comparison of the results to other studies, and the
conclusions that can be drawn
This is an important point, which relates to the fact that we have devised our experiments to
both the literature on anxiety studies in rats, and studies that investigate effects of cat odour
and conditioning effects. The open field arena we used is indeed smaller than the one
generally used for anxiety studies, however it is similar in size to the arena used for studies
into the effects of cat odour and conditioning (see Dielenberg et al 2001 for a review). We
have deliberately chosen for a compromise and used a test arena that is somewhat smaller
than the one routinely used to investigate open field behaviour but is still expected to result in
the qualitatively similar responses (see also Eilam, 2003; Gould et al., 2009).
In order to clarify this to the reader, we follow the Editors request and now mention in the
revised manuscript that the open field arena we used is not standard in order to comply with
studies into effects of rat odour (line 308-310), that this may compromize the direct
comparisons to the results of other studies (line 311-312), and that the findings done in the
present study suggest that future studies should assess methodological aspects of risk-related
behaviour in environments of various sizes (lines 312-314).
Reviewer #2: 4) The term cognitive style is still in the abstract and referred to in several
different places in the text; 5) The keywords now refers to 'coping style' which is
similarly unclear.
The Editor requests: 4) Removing all unwarranted terms (objected to by both
reviewers) from the manuscript - i.e. "cognitive style", "coping style" etc.
The terms ‘cognitive style’ and ‘coping style’ may indeed be confusing as they are derived
from another scientific domain. We have therefore revised the manuscript. The terms have
been removed from the paper with the exception of some phrases in the final part of the
discussion where we use these terms is in the context of potential for future research (lines
302-307 and 356-365 respectively).
