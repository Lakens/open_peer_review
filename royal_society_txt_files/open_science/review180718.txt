Roscini and coll. investigated an integrated approach to evaluate the toxicity of lignocellulosic
stillage using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy on three S. cerevisiae strains and a model
for time-effective prediction of inhibitory compounds. The experiment tested specific compounds
that are commonly present in stillages within a wide range of concentrations. The manuscript is
well written, the methodology was carefully described and the results are well articulated with
relevant discussion. However, before acceptance I would recommend the authors to address the
following suggestions that will improve the manuscript.
- Abstract. Please avoid the use of abbreviations (i.e. FTIR) since it is not for the readers to
understand the terminology.

research, what can be improved in the bioassay and models, and why/how is valuable this
approach in practical applications (e.g. can you recommend one strain that can be universally
used or shall the operator use all three strains to conduct a prediction of inhibitors?). Some of the
part that is already written in the conclusions section can be useful for building up such a section.
Finally, please shorten the conclusions by adding only the take home messages based on the
current work (and thus omit any references).

The manuscript RSOS-180718 by Luca et al. describes experimental assays and models to predict
the concentrations of inhibiter's in stillage resulting from lignocellulosic bioethanol production.
The authors have tested three Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (Fp84, Fm17 and DSM70449) with
varying levels of tolerance to weak acids and furans. Three models are then presented which
based on the responses of the Saccharomyces strains in the FTIR and biocidal assays will predict
the concentrations of inhibitors in the stillage.
The work is timely but suffers from weak statistical support. Only three replicates have been used
for each test and each strain. The authors should increase the number of replicates to at least four
or more.
Absorbance values (OD600 = 12) are provided to indicate the concentration of the strain used in
the assay, it is suggested that the authors instead present concentration as number of cells/ml.
Although authors provide information regarding statistical tests in the Methods section, the
legends for the figures must include details about the statistical test used to test significance and
the statistical significance levels. The figures should also indicate whether the differences
presented are statistically significant.
Authors must mention which R package was used for statistical analyses and specify what tests
were performed in R and what tests were performed in MS Excel.
Figure 1 is not required in the main text, this may be presented as supplementary information.
Authors are requested to provide line numbers as this helps in the review process. For instance
on page 4, second para, the sentence “The model ... nonspecific information” is not clear and
requires rephrasing. Line numbers helps the reviewer to pin-point the location that may require
improvements.

In the study authors have used Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy to detect different
mixtures of inhibitors as paradigm of different lignocellulosic stillage compositions, which was
previously successfully applied for the assessment of stress-induced cell status in re-sponse to
various stressors.
3 strains of yeast out of 160 were selected to establish a FTIR method for evaluating pollu-tant
nature of lignocellulose stillage. Could they explain, why they specifically used volumes of 12 in
OD?
I found difficulties in following their findings in the absence of FTIR spectra. Thus, it should be
mandatory to supply all the spectra in supporting information for better understanding by
reviewers and readers. I would like to go through the MS again once these data will be supplied.
There are some issues related to English usage that should be corrected.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was applied to assess the impact of lignocellulose
stillage pollutant by-products on the metabolism and growth rate of three Saccharomyces
cerevisiae strains. Spectroscopic data obtained in replicate dose-response experiments with single
by-products or their mixtures - and cross-validated by the results of a biocidal assay - were used
to calculate the equation parameters of prediction models. A second degree correlation curve
5
described the relationships between the relative concentrations (RCs) of biological inhibitors and
selected spectroscopic stress indexes (SI). Weighted equations adopted to optimize the models
resulted differently able to predict the biocidal concentrations of singles as well as quaternary
inhibitor mixtures. It was concluded that the new approach based on FTIR bioassay may
represents a valid tool to support the eco-toxicological management of lignocellulosic stillage
with the advantage of being a simple, rapid, cheap and reliable method exploitable also with
FTIR handheld instrumentation.
Research questions and study objectives have been clearly defined. Experimental design and
methods have been sufficiently described/referenced to reproduce the study. The results of
statistical analysis address the research questions as well as support conclusions.

“However, the higher levels of heavy metals together with the occurrence of unusual inhibitory compounds

in practical applications (e.g. can you recommend one strain that can be universally used or shall the

shorten the conclusions by adding only the take home messages based on the current work (and thus
omit any references).
Response: As suggested by the Reviewer, we provided a new version of both the final
paragraphs of Results and Discussion and the Conclusions sections. (Pages 11-12, Lines 282-314).
“Overall, the present study proposes a novel tool to plan proper dilution rates and/or flows for the
ecotoxicological management of lignocellulosic stillages. The desirable diffusion of large-scale ethanol
plants will require new simple and cheap approaches to reduce the inhibitors content at safety levels in view
of different possible uses of stillage [1, 12, 35].
Furthermore, the final disposition of treated stillages will require rapid and reliable analysis of their
inhibitors content to avoid any environmental hazard [14]. Moreover, most of the literature data refer to
bench-scale systems and many post-disposal monitoring programs are conducted in the short-term,
highlighting a consistent lack of data on the proper management of these waste and their reuse in the long-
term [36].
Furthermore, most of the bioassays so far reported is not tailored to quantify and classify the changes
detected, without analysing the type of action and the strength of their activity on living cells. The approach
applied in this work has been already designed to serve as an eco-toxicological assay and successfully

applied in different fields including the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the antagonistic effects of
inhibitors mixtures on S. cerevisiae metabolism [33].
Conclusions
The present study provides a novel approach to support the ecotoxicological management of
lignocellulosic stillage based on the modeling of FTIR spectra of S. cerevisiae cells challenged with
quaternary cocktails of lignocellulosic inhibitors.
Compared to the traditional chemical analyses, FTIR spectroscopy offers the advantage of a rapid, non-
invasive and cheap method also exploitable with a handheld instrument. This would open the possibility of
testing the actual effect of the stillage, or any other type of compound or complex mixtures of toxic
compounds, on living cells, very useful in environmental sciences.
All test microorganisms resulted excellent sensors for the stressing conditions tested and, therefore, for
the prediction of the RCs of inhibitory compounds normally found into lignocellulosic stillage. The choice of
S. cerevisiae cells as biosensors represents a valid model because their eukaryotic nature could allow to
extend the results of this bioassay also to other eukaryotes, including plants and man while their microbial
nature is ideal for the lab usage. Furthermore, depending on the case, the procedure could easily be applied
to other test organisms through a simple a priori calibration of the model.
Finally, this bioassay can be further upgraded by producing large FTIR libraries with the actual stillages
coming from productive plants, improving the level of predictability without limiting the ease of application.
The application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a further perspective to potentiate this bioassay.”

the concentrations of inhibiter's in stillage resulting from lignocellulosic bioethanol production. The
authors have tested three Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (Fp84, Fm17 and DSM70449) with
varying levels of tolerance to weak acids and furans. Three models are then presented which based
on the responses of the Saccharomyces strains in the FTIR and biocidal assays will predict the
concentrations of inhibitors in the stillage.
The work is timely but suffers from weak statistical support. Only three replicates have been used
for each test and each strain. The authors should increase the number of replicates to at least four or
more.
Response: We thank the Reviewer for this comment which allows us to highlight the strong
statistical basis of our research paper. This work has been designed and conducted according to the
scientific literature on FTIR analysis of microbial samples. As such, each culture sample has been
analyzed in triplicate, i.e., three IR spectra from three independent 35 µl samples from each cellular
suspension were acquired. Moreover, as already detailed in the text (Page 6, Line 139), each
spectrum is the average of 256 scans of the single machine replica (high quality spectrum). Finally,
we have demonstrated in a previous work (Roscini, L., Corte, L., Antonielli, L., Rellini, P.,
Fatichenti, F., & Cardinali, G. (2010). Influence of cell geometry and number of replicas in the
reproducibility of whole cell FTIR analysis. Analyst, 135(8), 2099-2105) that there is no significant
loss of statistical support using three machine replicas for each sample [“Similarly, the bootstrap of
machine replicas evidenced a linear decrease from 0.00014 to 0.00010 with r = 2 and r = 12”],
neither it can be generally argued that four are different from three replicas. Nevertheless, in order
to better explain the procedure, we have amended the text as follows (Page 6, Lines 134-140):
“Each culture sample was analyzed in triplicate. For each strain 105 µl volume was sampled for
three independent FTIR readings (35 µl each, according to the technique suggested by Manfait and
colleagues [30]). FTIR measurements were performed in transmission mode. All spectra were

recorded in the range between 4000 and 400 cm-1 with a TENSOR 27 FTIR spectrometer, equipped
with HTS-XT accessory for rapid automation of the analysis (BRUKER Optics GmbH, Ettlingen,
Germany). Spectral resolution was set at 4 cm-1, sampling 256 scans per sample to obtain high
quality spectra (signal to noise ratio values > 4000 within the 2100-1900 cm-1 interval). The

Absorbance values (OD600 = 12) are provided to indicate the concentration of the strain used in the
assay, it is suggested that the authors instead present concentration as number of cells/ml.
Response: We thank the Reviewer for this indication and we amended the text accordingly,
as follows (Page 6, Line 121):
“Each cells suspension was centrifuged (3 min at 5,300 x g), washed twice with distilled sterile
water and re-suspended with proper volumes of distilled water to obtain a final concentration of
2.5x108 cell/mL.”
Although authors provide information regarding statistical tests in the Methods section, the legends
for the figures must include details about the statistical test used to test significance and the
statistical significance levels. The figures should also indicate whether the differences presented are
statistically significant.
Response: The information regarding statistical analysis performed and the level of
statistical significance has been added, where appropriate, in the figure captions.
Authors must mention which R package was used for statistical analyses and specify what tests
were performed in R and what tests were performed in MS Excel.
Response: Synthetic stress indexes were calculated using “R” base package and “R” script
MSA written by G. Cardinali and colleagues (Corte et al. Analytica Chimica Acta - 2010) while
Pearson linear regression, Student t-Test and statistics to test hypotheses on the means and/or the

medians were performed in MS Excel. The following text has been amended according to the
Reviewer suggestion (Page 7, Lines 158-164).
“Regression analysis, modeling and statistics were performed using mathematical and statistical
functions under MS Excel and "R"(www.cran.org), respectively. R base package and “R” script
MSA [32] has been used to calculate SI. According to the distribution of results, parametric and/or
non-parametric statistics were applied in MS Excel to test hypotheses on the means and/or the
medians, respectively. The a value was set to 0.05 and the level of significant difference to p < 0.05.
Pearson linear regression analysis was applied to test the best fitting between RC and FTIR data
(MS Excel). Statistical significance of the general models was assessed by Student t-Test (MS
Excel)”.
Figure 1 is not required in the main text, this may be presented as supplementary information.
Response: We thank the Reviewer for this comment. However, we think that Fig. 1 helps the
reader to better understand the rational and future perspectives of the research project. As such, we
propose to keep it within the main text.
Authors are requested to provide line numbers as this helps in the review process. For instance on
page 4, second para, the sentence “The model ... nonspecific information” is not clear and requires
rephrasing. Line numbers helps the reviewer to pin-point the location that may require
improvements.
Response: We added line numbers and we proposed a new version of the sentence at Page
11 (Lines 277-279), as follows:
“The increased predictivity of the second model depends on the option to attribute a specific weight
to each primary model equation considering only those areas which best respond to these specific
stressing conditions.”

Comments to the Author(s)
In the study authors have used Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy to detect different mixtures
of inhibitors as paradigm of different lignocellulosic stillage compositions, which was previously
successfully applied for the assessment of stress-induced cell status in response to various stressors.
3 strains of yeast out of 160 were selected to establish a FTIR method for evaluating pollutant
nature of lignocellulose stillage. Could they explain, why they specifically used volumes of 12 in
OD?
Response: We thank the Reviewer for this comment. OD600 cell density = 12 (corresponding
to 2.5x108 cell/mL, see Response to Reviewer 3 at Page 8) has been optimized for FTIR stress
bioassay (Corte et al. Analytica Chimica Acta - 2010) and represents the optimal cell density useful
to have clear and repeatable IR spectra.
I found difficulties in following their findings in the absence of FTIR spectra. Thus, it should be
mandatory to supply all the spectra in supporting information for better understanding by reviewers
and readers. I would like to go through the MS again once these data will be supplied.
Response: We supplied all the spectra as ESM (Electronic Supplementary Material).
There are some issues related to English usage that should be corrected.
Response: We checked all the text and improved the English usage.

Comments to the Author(s)
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was applied to assess the impact of lignocellulose
stillage pollutant by-products on the metabolism and growth rate of three Saccharomyces cerevisiae
strains. Spectroscopic data obtained in replicate dose-response experiments with single by-products
or their mixtures - and cross-validated by the results of a biocidal assay - were used to calculate the
equation parameters of prediction models. A second degree correlation curve described the
relationships between the relative concentrations (RCs) of biological inhibitors and selected
spectroscopic stress indexes (SI). Weighted equations adopted to optimize the models resulted
differently able to predict the biocidal concentrations of singles as well as quaternary inhibitor
mixtures. It was concluded that the new approach based on FTIR bioassay may represents a valid
tool to support the eco-toxicological management of lignocellulosic stillage with the advantage of
being a simple, rapid, cheap and reliable method exploitable also with FTIR handheld
instrumentation.
Research questions and study objectives have been clearly defined. Experimental design and
methods have been sufficiently described/referenced to reproduce the study. The results of
statistical analysis address the research questions as well as support conclusions.
Response: We thank the Reviewer for this comment.
