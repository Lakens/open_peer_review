Vorster and co-workers reported the synthesis of silver-assisted, seedless gold nanostars. The
nanostars were monodispersed, multi-branched and stable in various conditions such as salt,
ionic strength and cell culture medium environments by functionalized with
polyvinylpyrrolidone. In conclusion, the addition of the silver nitrate significantly improves the
synthesis of the reported nanostars attaching antibodies and enzymes. In general, the research
topic is interesting, and the result is satisfactory, however, there are some issues about
experimental details and figures.
The detailed comments are listed as follows:
1) Elemental analysis and TEM mapping are recommended for the characterizing gold nanostars.
2) Some legend information in Figure 1B are incorrect. The average wavelength at samples of the
8µL +Ag should be 598 nm.
3) Please note the uniformity of the tenses used in the article.
4) For the results of the NMR spectra in Fig. 5A, please mark which group of three curves
represents respectively? The resolution of Fig. 5B is low, and the contrast of the figure needs to be
adjusted.
5) In the caption of Figure 6, “in seum supplemented medium.” should be changed to “in serum
supplemented medium”.
6) For environmental effect on nanostar stability, nanostars synthesized by the seeded methods
with addition of silver nitrate should also be compared and analyzed.
7) The resolution of most figures in the main text is low, and needs improvement.

The manuscript reports on the synthesis of gold nanostars using HEPES as reducing reaction
medium and the polymer PVP as stabilizing agent. The authors show that the addition of silver
ions improve the quality of the final nanostars in terms of control of number of tips. The
presented methodology of gold nanostars synthesis is not novel itself (see for example J. Am.
Chem. Soc. 2019, 141, 4034-4042 and its references). Although the paper is interesting and the
conclusions are based on the results, I have doubts about the appealing of the study to the broad
audience of Royal Society Open Science. The investigation is rather specific because: (i) the
purpose of some experiments is not clear (for instance the stabilization at different pHs); (ii) a
final objective of this nanoparticles has not been addressed (for example in biomedical
application); (iii) there is a lack of presented results (it seems that PVP stabilization has been used
only for some type of gold nanostars synthesized in the presence of silver or it has not been
analysed the benefits of PVP instead of other polymers such as PEG); and (iv) it is not clear the
quality of the final products considering that obtaining better shapes of gold nanostars leads to
increments of the formation of spherical gold nanoparticles as byproducts. Therefore, I do
question whether Royal Society Open Science is the suitable outlet of this work, and I rather feel
that this work will be of interest to a rather specialized subset of authors.

Vorster and co-workers reported the synthesis of silver-assisted, seedless gold nanostars. The
nanostars were monodispersed, multi-branched and stable in various conditions such as salt, ionic
strength and cell culture medium environments by functionalized with polyvinylpyrrolidone. In
conclusion, the addition of the silver nitrate significantly improves the synthesis of the reported
nanostars attaching antibodies and enzymes. In general, the research topic is interesting, and the
result is satisfactory, however, there are some issues about experimental details and figures.
The detailed comments are listed as follows:
1) Elemental analysis and TEM mapping are recommended for the characterizing gold nanostars.
<U+F0B7> The elemental analysis was done using EDS and added in the results discussion section. We were
however unable to do TEM mapping as this was not available to us.
2) Some legend information in Figure 1B are incorrect. The average wavelength at samples of the 8µL
+Ag should be 598 nm.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for this observation. This has been adjusted accordingly
3) Please note the uniformity of the tenses used in the article.
<U+F0B7> Noted. The grammar and tenses were reviewed and corrected throughout the article.
4) For the results of the NMR spectra in Fig. 5A, please mark which group of three curves represents
respectively? The resolution of Fig. 5B is low, and the contrast of the figure needs to be adjusted.
<U+F0B7> The image was adjusted accordingly and the graphics enhanced.
5) In the caption of Figure 6, “in seum supplemented medium.” should be changed to “in serum
supplemented medium”.
<U+F0B7> Noted with thanks. The typing error was corrected.
6) For environmental effect on nanostar stability, nanostars synthesized by the seeded methods with
addition of silver nitrate should also be compared and analyzed.
<U+F0B7> The seeded method was not compared in this case as this article focused seedless synthesis and
the resulting morphology. The suggested comparison would be, however, considered for future
study.
7) The resolution of most figures in the main text is low, and needs improvement.
<U+F0B7> The figures were adjusted with higher resolutions.

The manuscript reports on the synthesis of gold nanostars using HEPES as reducing reaction medium
and the polymer PVP as stabilizing agent. The authors show that the addition of silver ions improve
the quality of the final nanostars in terms of control of number of tips. The presented methodology
of gold nanostars synthesis is not novel itself (see for example J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019, 141,
4034-4042 and its references).
<U+F0B7> Thank you for bringing my attention to the above mentioned article.
Silver nitrate has been used extensively in gold nanostars seeded synthesis as a shape directing
agent. It has also been used to a much lesser degree in seedless synthesis methods. The use of
HEPES has been the predominant seedless shape directing agent. There is, however, room for
improvement in the end result of the morphologies obtained by the HEPES synthesis method. The
manuscript has been revised to highlight the novel contribution of this study.
Although the paper is interesting and the conclusions are based on the results, I have doubts about
the appealing of the study to the broad audience of Royal Society Open Science. The investigation is
rather specific because:
(i) The purpose of some experiments is not clear (for instance the stabilization at different pHs);
<U+F0B7> This was stated in the manuscript, however, has been rewritten to make it clearer. It now reads
as “These parameters were chosen as most bioassay work would require the nanostars to be
stable in these conditions.”
(ii) A final objective of this nanoparticles has not been addressed (for example in biomedical
application);
<U+F0B7> The concluding statement has been modified to clarify this and now reads as “This green synthesis
method is facile and repeatable. It is a safe method for long term use, thus making it attractive
for gold nanostar synthesis for use as scaffolds in biosensors fabrication. Further studies to
evaluate this particular feasibility of these nanostars in biosensors are undergoing in our
laboratory.”
(iii) There is a lack of presented results (it seems that PVP stabilization has been used only for some
type of gold nanostars synthesized in the presence of silver or it has not been analysed the benefits
of PVP instead of other polymers such as PEG).
<U+F0B7> An adjustment was made to make this point clearer. It now reads as “The stabilization of other
coating polymers was not assessed as this was done in another study found in literature using
HEPES buffer. What was found was that PEG was not a good stabilising agent compared to PVP
and CTAB (1). PVP was, thus, chosen as it was the less toxic reagent when compared to CTAB (2,
3).”
(iv) It is not clear the quality of the final products considering that obtaining better shapes of gold
nanostars leads to increments of the formation of spherical gold nanoparticles as byproducts.
Therefore, I do question whether Royal Society Open Science is the suitable outlet of this work,
and I rather feel that this work will be of interest to a rather specialized subset of authors.
<U+F0B7> Each synthesis method has its own yield rate where other morphologies are by products. Not all
synthesis methods yield rates are documented in literature, however, here is an article which did
show their yield rate (4). This information was added to the manuscript. “Liu et. al synthesized
nanostars with four long branched arms by manipulating the HEPES concentration and solution
temperature. The yield rates obtained for the nanostars were 65% tetrapods, 6% five branches
or more, 15% two-three branches and 14% spherical and irregular shapes (4).”
Royal Society Open Science Journal covers the entire range of science without the usual
restrictions on scope. We, therefore, believe our manuscript is suitable for publication by as the
journal is open to many readers of different disciplines, such as nanotechnology.
