In general, I am very positive about the current paper. I feel it is very important to document the
different steps in going from basic experimentation to more clinical samples and even if a training
fails to result in clinical improvement it is crucial for the field to know. I am also positive about
the preregistration, adherence to trial standards and the use of frequentist as well as bayesian
analyses.
I would suggest a number of changes.
The authors denote their training as CBM. I agree this is a CBM approach but I think it would be
more clear to label the training more closely in line with the process it tries to target. This will

I liked the exploratory analyses based on symptoms. I was wondering whether it is an option to
perform exploratory analyses on the target process. That is, within the task, an individual
baseline assessment of interpreting emotional facial expressions is performed. Provided the
healthy sample, some individuals may already have positive tendencies in their interpretations of
facial expressions whereas others may not. To me this seems like a useful candidate to include as
covariate.
I understand the selection of some of the tests in the current battery of other cognitive task to
examine transfer effects. However, most of these tasks strike me as tasks that are quite far
removed from the process of disambiguating facial expressions. This issue could be considered
more extensively in the discussion.

This article tests a CBM paradigm for shifting interpretation of facial expressions, and evaluates if
results transfer to different symptom measures and cognitive tasks. In general, the paper is well
written and the study is interesting and makes an important contribution to the CBM literature. I
applaud the authors for pre-registering their study on OSF! However, I have some concerns,
which should be addressed prior to acceptance for publication.
Major Concerns:
-In my opinion, your intervention seems more relevant to social anxiety, as opposed to
depression (given that individuals with soc anxiety misinterpret facial expressions). Why did you
choose to focus on depression instead of social anxiety? Please expand theoretical reasons in
introduction, and discuss as a potential limitation (e.g., perhaps you would see transfer to
measures related to social anxiety, as opposed to depression).
-The moderating effect you find for the dot-probe task related to anxiety seems to be in the
opposite direction from what you describe: CBM seems to have led to MORE bias for pts with
higher levels of anxiety, not LESS bias. Please double check interpretation of this result, and
updated discussion if needed.
-In discussion, consider that training was done at home instead of in lab. Might that affect
strength of effects?
-Please clarify where readers can access the data (it is clear where materials and protocols can be
accessed, but not clear where data can be accessed).
-Please describe the Penton-Voak study earlier. As it reads now, you state you will replicate
Penton-Voak before you explain what they did. Please also expand on theoretical rationale for
why you chose this specific CBM task.
Minor Concerns:
-I do not think ceiling effect is the correct term for the result you found related to trait anxiety.
Instead, I would say results were moderated by trait anxiety.
-Make it clear earlier in paper that you are focusing on depressive symptoms (as opposed to
anxiety).
-Switch order of first two paragraphs—start by describing the problem (limited access to
treatment), then offer the potential solution (CBM).
-Make sure you include citations for all claims in introduction (e.g., should have cites related to
how interpretation of expression is related to non-depressed patients, how perception of emotion
should lead to transfer effects---right now, you state these things without citations).
-Why is the Penton-Voak task easier to program than other CBM tasks? I’m not sure I agree.
-Please label or name the CBM task you are using-maybe PBM for perception bias modification?
Otherwise, when you make claims about this specific CBM task, it seems like you are making
claims about all CBM tasks (e.g., ABM, IBM, etc…).
-Why do you exclude potential participants with psychiatric disorders?
4
-Please proofread paper for typos (e.g., “enrolment”) and for confusing grammar (e.g., I couldn’t
follow second to last sentence in procedure). This will greatly enhance clarity of manuscript.
-Explain your CBM task prior to describing procedure.
-Where did you get the face pictures from?
-Please explain how you came up with the formula you use for creating balance points,
-Describe the subscales of DSI in the text (not just in a caption), since you refer to results related
to the subscales.
-What does it mean that the dot-probe was “recoded” (p. 9)?
-I cannot follow last full sentence on p. 10. Please revise.

In general, I am very positive about the current paper. I feel it is very important to
document the different steps in going from basic experimentation to more clinical
samples and even if a training fails to result in clinical improvement it is crucial for the
field to know. I am also positive about the preregistration, adherence to trial standards
and the use of frequentist as well as bayesian analyses.
I would suggest a number of changes.
The authors denote their training as CBM. I agree this is a CBM approach but I think it
would be more clear to label the training more closely in line with the process it tries to
target. This will clarify to the readership that a certain type of CBM fails to induce
changes
We agree and have changed the term to face bias modification. We have only used CBM
when referring to the process generally, and have changed all other references to our more
specific training to FBM. Additional changes in text (new material underlined):
“A newly developed CBM task design described here as face bias modification (FBM) that
targets the interpretation of emotional expressions (happy versus sad) via an online training
procedure (Adams et al., 2013) represents a promising candidate.”
I liked the exploratory analyses based on symptoms. I was wondering whether it is an
option to perform exploratory analyses on the target process. That is, within the task,
an individual baseline assessment of interpreting emotional facial expressions is
performed. Provided the healthy sample, some individuals may already have positive
tendencies in their interpretations of facial expressions whereas others may not. To me
this seems like a useful candidate to include as covariate.
This seems a very useful candidate that we had not considered. We explored correlations
between the first acquired balance point and the target processes for all the variables of
interest. None were significant with the exception of state anxiety:
Page 12: “In a post-hoc analysis, we explored possible correlations between the first acquired
balance point and the manipulation on our effects of interest (calculated as a baseline subtracted
from post-training contrast). There was a marginally nonsignificant correlation between
baseline FBM and state anxiety ratings over time (r=-0.272, N=52, p=0.051) in the active
group, whereby those with a higher balance point at baseline showed a greater reduction in
state anxiety post-training. This was not shown in the sham group (r=0.011, N=52, p=0.942).
However, the difference between these slopes was not significant (p=0.149). There was no
time*BP interaction in any of the other variables of interest (all p>0.115).”
Page 16: “There was also some evidence for a correlation between the first acquired FBM
balance points and state anxiety over time, indicating that those in the intervention group with
a higher balance point at baseline showed a greater reduction in state anxiety post-training
(which was not shown in the sham group). This provides some evidence for the efficacy of
the paradigm, however, the difference between the intervention and sham slopes was not
significant, so strong inferences should not be drawn.”
In addition, within training, we found no evidence of an interaction between FBM and
baseline BDI/trait anxiety for individuals in the intervention group (page 12):
“Exploratory post hoc analysis: The effect of baseline trait anxiety and BDI on the omnibus
interaction or FBM across training for the intervention group, and the effect of baseline
perception bias modification (FBM) and the omnibus interaction for the intervention group
…
There was no evidence of an interaction between FBM and baseline BDI (p=0.441) or trait
anxiety (p=0.119).”
I understand the selection of some of the tests in the current battery of other cognitive
task to examine transfer effects. However, most of these tasks strike me as tasks that are
quite far removed from the process of disambiguating facial expressions. This issue
could be considered more extensively in the discussion.
The following has been added to the discussion (new material underlined):
Page 17: “Another explanation for our lack of effects is that while one week was sufficient to
induce a change in bias, it may not be long enough to observe corresponding changes in
mood. For instance, improvements in mood may only occur as the individual learns how to
interact with and respond to the world within the new, more positive cognitive framework
(Harmer et al., 2009) and this process takes longer than a week. However, counter to this
argument is that Munafò et al. (personal communication, November 2016) showed no effects
on some measures of mood at six week follow up. Although a substantial FBM effect was
observed, it is possible that training at home (versus in lab) may have affected the strength of
effects. It may also be that the tasks selected in this study were too far removed from the
process of disambiguating facial expressions. We chose these tasks, which have been shown
to be disrupted in depression, precisely because they are so different. Specifically, if transfer
of effects occurs then it should shift other processes that are sensitive to depression.
However, perhaps tasks closer to the underlying process being targeted would be more
successful.”

This article tests a CBM paradigm for shifting interpretation of facial expressions, and
evaluates if results transfer to different symptom measures and cognitive tasks. In
general, the paper is well written and the study is interesting and makes an important
contribution to the CBM literature. I applaud the authors for pre-registering their
study on OSF! However, I have some concerns, which should be addressed prior to
acceptance for publication.
Major Concerns:
-In my opinion, your intervention seems more relevant to social anxiety, as opposed to
depression (given that individuals with soc anxiety misinterpret facial expressions).
Why did you choose to focus on depression instead of social anxiety? Please expand
theoretical reasons in introduction, and discuss as a potential limitation (e.g., perhaps
you would see transfer to measures related to social anxiety, as opposed to depression).
Although the reviewer rightly points out that the misinterpretation of facial expressions has
been shown in social anxiety, we chose the focus on depression as the paradigm intends to
induce a positive bias for happy versus sad faces (e.g., compared with happy versus
threatening faces, which might be used in a comparable paradigm for anxiety).
We have added the following to the introduction (page 2): “Although the misinterpretation of
facial expressions has been shown in social anxiety (Horley et al., 2004), this FBM task
focuses on inducing a positive bias for happy vs. sad faces relevant to depression (e.g.,
compared with happy versus threatening faces, which might be used in a comparable
paradigm for anxiety).”
And to the discussion (page 17): “In fact, it may be that, as face perception is disrupted in
social anxiety (Horley et al., 2004), we may have seen transfer to measures related to social
anxiety as opposed to depression.”
-The moderating effect you find for the dot-probe task related to anxiety seems to be in
the opposite direction from what you describe: CBM seems to have led to MORE bias
for pts with higher levels of anxiety, not LESS bias. Please double check interpretation
of this result, and updated discussion if needed.
Upon reanalysis of this result it appears that the interaction reported in the original paper does
not hold - originally the incorrect values were used to calculate the proportion biases. The
actual interaction between the dot probe accuracy value and baseline Trait anxiety is r=-
0.056, p=0.704. We have therefore updated the paper accordingly:
1) We have removed the graph and statistics from the results section.
2) We have removed reference to this from the results and discussion section
3) We have rerun all other statistics and graphs to ensure that we did not make similar
mistakes.
-In discussion, consider that training was done at home instead of in lab. Might that affect
strength of effects?
This is an interesting point, so we now add it to the discussion (page 17):
“Although a substantial FBM effect was observed, it is possible that training at home (versus
in lab) may have affected the strength of effects.”
-Please clarify where readers can access the data (it is clear where materials and
protocols can be accessed, but not clear where data can be accessed).
A link to the data is included in the data accessibility section at the end of the paper.
However, for clarity, “Data are available for download” and a footnote link to
https://osf.io/7uzwx/ have been added at the end of the statistical analyses section (page 9).
-Please describe the Penton-Voak study earlier. As it reads now, you state you will
replicate Penton-Voak before you explain what they did. Please also expand on
theoretical rationale for why you chose this specific CBM task.
We describe what Penton-Voak et al. (2012) did on page 2: “Prior results have indeed shown
that this FBM task for facial recognition successfully induces a positivity bias in healthy
adults that is retained for at least two weeks (Penton-Voak et al., 2012), and generalises to
non-trained facial stimuli (Dalili et al., 2016).” This is prior to discussion of replication on
page 3
Our rationale for choosing this specific FBM task is expressed in our aims (page 3, new
material underlined): “Firstly, we aim to replicate findings by Penton-Voak et al. (2012) in
order to evaluate the efficacy of this FBM task in inducing a positive cognitive bias. As
outlined above, altering negative cognitive biases may be critical in treating affective
disorders yet the clinical potential of CBM remains unclear. There is a long literature
showing the misinterpretation of faces in depression (as well as other mood and anxiety
disorders; e.g., Horley et al., 2004; Langenecker et al., 2007; Leppänen et al., 2004), which
this FBM task specifically targets. Moreover, this task is quicker, easier (simple to use by
virtue of only requiring a single choice, and not dependent in reaction time and can be
completed online), and less expensive than many bias modification alternatives (e.g.,
Stoddard et al., 2016). Given this, we chose to assess this FBM task in a healthy sample as
proof of concept. Studies such as these are imperative for understanding a technique’s
potential prior to considering it in a clinical population.”
Minor Concerns:
-I do not think ceiling effect is the correct term for the result you found related to trait
anxiety. Instead, I would say results were moderated by trait anxiety.
This has been changed (new material underlined, redacted material struck through):
Page 1: There was, however, weak, inconclusive evidence of transfer to a self-report measure
of stress, a cognitive measure of anhedonia, and evidence that results were moderated by trait
anxiety (whereby transference was greatest in those with higher symptoms).
Page 12: “As participants were recruited from a healthy sample, it was possible that those in
the intervention group already had a positive bias and so FBM could not push them further
(e.g., ceiling effects).”
Page 12: “In both cases this suggests that FBM only reduced cognitive measures of negative
affect in those with higher levels of trait anxiety (indeed, it may have had the opposite effect
in those with low trait anxiety) providing evidence that these results were moderated by trait
anxiety.”
Page 16: “Although, such individuals are clearly amenable to training, and may indeed posses
sub threshold symptoms, we also explored the possibility that results were moderated by
symptoms in some individuals.”
-Make it clear earlier in paper that you are focusing on depressive symptoms (as
opposed to anxiety).
In the second paragraph of the introduction (where we introduce the FBM paradigm, page 2)
we have changed our description to clarify its focus on depressive symptoms (added material
underlined).
“A newly developed CBM task design described here face bias modification (FBM) that
targets the interpretation of emotional expressions (happy versus sad) via an online training
procedure (Adams et al., 2013) represents a promising candidate.” The following sentence
discusses our rationale for focus on depressive symptoms: “The ability to recognise and
comprehend emotion in facial expressions is critical for social functioning and is disrupted in
depression (e.g., Anderson et al., 2011), but is also relevant to the non-depressed
population…”
-Switch order of first two paragraphs—start by describing the problem (limited access
to treatment), then offer the potential solution (CBM).
These paragraphs have been edited to present the problem first, followed by the potential
solution.
-Make sure you include citations for all claims in introduction (e.g., should have cites
related to how interpretation of expression is related to non-depressed patients, how
perception of emotion should lead to transfer effects---right now, you state these things
without citations).
Re: interpretation of expression is related to non-depressed patients
Page 2 (new material underlined): “The ability to recognise and comprehend emotion in
facial expressions is critical for social functioning and is disrupted in depression (e.g.,
Anderson et al., 2011), but is also relevant to the non-depressed population (e.g., interpreting
ambiguous facial expressions as negative rather than positive will have a negative impact on
one’s mood regardless of the presence of an affective disorder; e.g., Gotlib et al., 2014;
Joormann et al., 2007).
These studies found that non-depressed girls with a risk of depression from having a
depressed mother exhibited a higher presence of negative cognitive biases than healthy
controls – indicating that negative biases are not limited to clinical populations.
Re: how perception of emotion should lead to transfer effects
Page 2: In theory, a positive bias in perception of ambiguous emotional expressions should
lead an individual towards a more favourable assessment of daily social interactions, and this
positive framework (or ‘schemata,’ Beck, 1987) should ultimately carry over into their mood
and other areas of cognition across both healthy and patient populations (e.g., Beevers et al.,
2015; Yang et al., 2015).
These studies both showed transference of CBM training to symptom reduction in depressed
samples.
-Why is the Penton-Voak task easier to program than other CBM tasks? I’m not sure I
agree.
By easier, we meant that the task is easier to use/deliver than some other CBM tasks due to
it’s simplicity (simply marking faces as happy or sad – e.g., compared with interpretational
tasks or 6AFC tasks) and the fact that it can be completed online. We do not claim that the
task is easier to programme than other CBM tasks. To clarify, we have added the following
(new material underlined):
Given this, we chose to assess the current CBM task, which is quicker, easier (simple to use
by virtue of only requiring a single choice, not dependent on reaction time, and can be
completed online), and less expensive than many bias modification alternatives (e.g.,
Stoddard et al., 2016), in a healthy sample as proof of concept.
-Please label or name the CBM task you are using-maybe PBM for perception bias
modification? Otherwise, when you make claims about this specific CBM task, it seems
like you are making claims about all CBM tasks (e.g., ABM, IBM, etc…).
We agree, however we cannot be sure whether the training modifies perception or
interpretation. Although only a subtle difference, given this we have instead changed the term
to face bias modification. We have only used CBM when referring to the process generally,
and have changed all other references to our more specific training to FBM. Additional
changes in text (new material underlined, page 2):
“A newly developed CBM task design described here as face bias modification (FBM) that
targets the interpretation (and/or perception) of emotional expressions (happy versus sad) via
an online training procedure (Adams et al., 2013) represents a promising candidate.”
-Why do you exclude potential participants with psychiatric disorders?
Regarding our sample selection, we argue that it would be unethical to study this technique as
a potential treatment for depression prior to obtaining proof of concept (i.e., confirming the
efficacy of the CBM task considered to induce a positive cognitive bias and have an effect on
mood), which this study aimed to do.
Page 3, “…we chose to assess this FBM task in a healthy sample as proof of concept. Studies
such as these are imperative for understanding a technique’s potential prior to considering it in
a clinical population.”
-Please proofread paper for typos (e.g., “enrolment”) and for confusing grammar (e.g., I
couldn’t follow second to last sentence in procedure). This will greatly enhance clarity
of manuscript.
Enrolment is the British English spelling (enrollment is American English). We have used
British English consistently throughout this paper.
The last sentence of the procedure has been rephrased for clarity: “Participants were asked to
complete the CBM task from a desktop computer/laptop once daily (6 at home sessions in total
for which they received reminder emails at 8:00AM) in between in lab sessions at baseline
(before CBM) and post-training (immediately after the final session of CBM).””
We have proofread this paper an additional time.
-Explain your CBM task prior to describing procedure.
We have moved the procedure section – it is now after the description of all tasks.
-Where did you get the face pictures from?
This information has been added to the FBM task description (page 4):
“The face pictures are morphed from several faces and are licensed from Cambridge
Cognition.”
-Please explain how you came up with the formula you use for creating balance points
This study was developed and used in the Penton-voak et al. (2012) study which we intended
to replicate, so we used the identical method/formula for creating balance points. The balance
points to establish the success of the procedure in modifying the perception of ambiguous
emotional expressions. To clarify, we have added (page 5):
“Balance points were used to establish the success of the procedure in modifying the
perception of ambiguous emotional expressions (Penton-Voak et al., 2012).”
“…balance points, described as the point in which they were equally likely to perceive happy
or sad.”
-Describe the subscales of DSI in the text (not just in a caption), since you refer to
results related to the subscales.
The following has been added (page 5): “Outcome measures for the DSI comprised average
impact rating (AIR), which refers to sum of the stress ratings attributed to these events
divided by the frequency and frequency, which refers to the number of events reported to
have occurred in the past 24 hours.”
-What does it mean that the dot-probe was “recoded” (p. 9)?
We ‘recoded’ our version (using the identical stimuli and method of the original task) to be
run online in a platform called Testable. This has been clarified (new material underlined):
Questionnaires, the AIEO, and the emotional dot-probe, recoded for online delivery, were run
online through Testable (Rezlescu, 2015).
-I cannot follow last full sentence on p. 10. Please revise.
This sentence has been divided into two sentences and rephrased for clarity: “Simple effects
show that this was driven by changes in both groups over time, albeit with weaker evidence
for change in the intervention group (control, F(1,101)=22.76, p<0.001; intervention,
F(1,101)=4.14, p=0.045). There was also a numerically smaller decrease in the proportion of
hard trials (versus easy trials) chosen by the intervention group (group differences not
significant at baseline (F(1,101)=0.02, p=0.88) or post-training (F(1,101)=0.9, 0.344)).”

In general, the authors did a nice job responding to reviews. A few questions/concerns
remain, which I describe below.
-In abstract: was transference greatest in those with higher symptoms at post-
intervention or at baseline? Please clarify.
Transference was greatest in those with higher baseline Trait anxiety. This has been added to
the abstract:
Page 1: “There was, however, weak, inconclusive evidence of transfer to a self-report
measure of stress, a cognitive measure of anhedonia, and evidence that results were
moderated by trait anxiety (whereby transference was greatest in those with higher baseline
symptoms).”
-I don’t like the label Face Bias Modification. What about IFBM, for interpretations of
face bias modification? Otherwise, it seems like you are specifically modifying faces (as
opposed to the process of interpreting or perceiving expressions of faces).
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have changed the label to Facial Interpretation
Bias Modification (FIBM) throughout the paper (which we hope is consistent with the
reviewer’s suggestion but scans slightly easier).
-add “for reducing depressive symptoms” or something similar to the end of the first
sentence in the second paragraph on page 2.
Page 2: “This has been added to the second paragraph: “However, these more comprehensive
‘transfer’ effects for reducing depressive symptoms have yet to be extensively studied.”
-In the new post-hoc analyses, it does not make sense to refer to “baseline FBM”—it
should be “balance point at baseline” or “interpretation of faces bias at baseline.” Also,
why do you include this as a correlate, as opposed to as a covariate in omnibus
interactions?
This has been changed.
Page 13: “There was a marginally nonsignificant correlation between the balance point at
baseline and state anxiety ratings over time (r=-0.272, N=52, p=0.051) in the active group,
whereby those with a higher balance point at baseline showed a greater reduction in state
anxiety post-training.”
Correlations were done because SPSS/JASP do not produce a time*group*covariate
interaction.
-I would like more detail on the Penton-Voak (2012) study mentioned in the
introduction.
We now explain this study in more detail in the introduction.
“Indeed, using this FIBM task, Penton-Voak et al. (2012) showed increased perception of
happiness (versus sadness) in ambiguous facial expressions, which was retained for at least
two weeks, as well as some evidence for increased positive affect in healthy adults, and Dalili
et al. (2016) showed that the task generalises to non-trained facial stimuli.”
