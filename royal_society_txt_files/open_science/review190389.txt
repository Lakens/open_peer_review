The research was carried out in a comprehensive way which gives sufficient credibility to the
main results. The particular value of the paper is in its original approach for analysing the results.
Interesting paper with an interesting approach that few researchers considered previously in this
field. However, I would like to recommend the following improvements:
1. In the Matlab analysis for the obtained SEM micro-images, authors did not mention the
dilemma of noise in the background. How authors managed to reduce the noise in the images for
a proper analysis?
2. In the abstract, authors have mentioned the OTSU method. In which part of the research did
authors use this method? I could only notice that the authors have used the box-counting
method.
3. In section 2.1 (Raw materials), please provide more information about Tailings A and B.
4. The introduction part is very short and needs to be extended. Despite the presence of very few
studies that discuss such materials and even the techniques that were used in this research,
authors need to explain more about other materials that were used to enhance the performance of
cement. Following papers could help:
- A novel approach of introducing crystalline protection material and curing agent in fresh
concrete for enhancing hydrophobicity.
- Development of hydrophobic concrete by adding dual-crystalline admixture at mixing stage.
- Influence of early water exposure on modified cementitious coating.
The paper is very interesting and I recommend it for publication but after the authors rectify the
comments.

The relation between micro porous structure and macro parameters of backfills is difficult to be
quantitatively calculated. This paper shares a method through calculating the fractal dimension
of pores. It is really an interesting topic.
The major problem is the language. The English needs substantial editing.
So I recommend that this paper can be published after language polish.

Reviewer 2 has recommended that the quality of English should be improved. A number of
uage polishing services are available for authors whose first language is not English.
s://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/language-polishing/
ponse 4: The manuscript was polished by American Journal Experts. The Editorial
tificate is in the following.
iewer: 1
(Reviewer1): In the Matlab analysis for the obtained SEM micro-images, authors did not
tion the dilemma of noise in the background. How authors managed to reduce the noise in
images for a proper analysis?
ponse 1: Yes, the noise in background is a dilemma. So I testes many methods to obtain ideal
lts. The details are as follows. The content has been added in section 3.3 SEM image
processing.
3.3 SEM image preprocessing
Image preprocessing mainly includes two aspects of image contrast adjustment and noise
uction.
3.3.1 Image contrast adjustment
Contrast adjustment is the basis of image edge extraction and image segmentation. By
sting image gray histogram, the color difference between target area and background area
be enhanced. Consequently target features can be enhanced, and background features can be
pressed. This study tested the decorrstretch (de-correlation stretching), adapthisteq (finite
trast adaptive histogram equalization), histeq (histogram equalization), imadjust, stretchilm,
1
imcontrast (calling contrast adjustment tool) functions which were used to adjust image
trast. Finally, the imcontrast function was used to adjust the image contrast, which can use an
ge contrast adjustment dialog box to realize the real-time observation adjustment effect and
ctly extract the optimal adjustment results.
3.3.2 Image noise reduction
Image noise can cause image blurring, pitting, etc., which will directly affect the image
rization results and bring errors to quantitative analysis of images. In this study, the effect of
e on quantitative analysis is reduced by image noise reduction operations and morphological
rations after image segmentation. This study tested and compared medfilt2 two-dimensional
ian filtering, ordfilt two-dimensional sorting statistical filtering, wiener2 two-dimensional
ner filtering, filter2 mean filtering, DTC discrete cosine variation, deconvblind blind
onvolution operation, a total of six methods about noise reduction. In order to preserve the
ge details as much as possible during noise reduction, it was finally determined to use the
r2 mean filtering method (average mean filter) to reduce image noise. The noise reduction
ration will cause tailing particles area to be blurred. Therefore, during denoising SEM images
ifferent quality backfill, the parameters should be carefully selected.
(Reviewer1): In the abstract, authors have mentioned the OTSU method. In which part of the
arch did authors use this method? I could only notice that the authors have used the box-
nting method.
ponse 2: the section 3.4 SEM image segmentation uses this method. But there is a mistake of
slation. I translated the proper noun “OTSU” to the maximum inter-class variance method in
text. This mistake has been revised in the manuscript.
ection 1 Introduction: The images were processed and the fractal dimensions of SEM images
he microscopic porous structure were calculated using OTSU and box dimension methods.

mentation threshold. In MATLAB, OTSU can be called by the function to calculate the image
mentation threshold.
ure4. The process for calculating the gray threshold of OTSU.
(Reviewer1): In section 2.1 (Raw materials), please provide more information about Tailings
nd B.
ponse 3: I have added information about Tailings A and B in the aspects of physical
perties and SEM images. The revised section is as follows:
tailing samples used in the study were obtained from the Gaofeng mine in Guangxi province,
na. The collected samples were divided into two types, i.e., Tailings A and Tailings B.

ings A is produced by an old-fashioned beneficiation process and Tailings B is produced by
ew type of beneficiation in a tin ore. The siliceous limestone was obtained from the quarry
und the Gaofeng mine. In this experiment, the samples of mine waste siliceous limestone
e ground in a horizontal ball mill with a volume of 35L, whereas the cylinder’s rotational
ed was 150 r/min. The processing time was 20 minutes. The limestone was made into stone
der having a certain particle size range, which was used to replace part of the cement. The
c physical properties of stone powder and tailings are shown in table 1. P42.5 cement with
strength grade of C30, produced by Changsha Xinxing Cement Factory, was selected as the
enting material. The main elements of the experimental raw materials were analyzed using
Dutch PANalytical X-ray fluorescence r, and the results are presented in table 2. Additionally,
stersizer2000 was used to analyze the particle size of the raw materials, and the results are
wn in figure 1. The SEM images of stone powder and tailings are shown in figure 2.

(Reviewer1): The introduction part is very short and needs to be extended. Despite the

his research, authors need to explain more about other materials that were used to enhance the
ormance of cement. Following papers could help:

ponse 4: The introduction part has been extended. In this part other materials that were used
nhance the performance of cement are introduced. The revised introduction and literatures
as follows:
rder to reduce the cost of cement in concrete and to manufacture special cement for various
cial purposes, many worldwide scholars have conducted extensive work on cement substitute
erials and concrete additives. Siddique [1] studied effects of volcanic ash on consistency,
ing times, workability, compressive strength, electrical resistivity of cement paste and mortar.
erdt et al. [2] found that the presence of 5% of limestone in concrete led to an increase of the
ume of the hydrates, as visible in the increase in chemical shrinkage, and an increase in
pressive strength. Kupwade-Patil et al. [3] investigated the effectiveness of the use of
anic ash along with silica fume as a partial replacement for Portland cement. Celik et al. [4]
orted the composition and properties of highly flowable self-consolidating concrete mixtures
e of high proportions of cement replacement materials such as fly ash and pulverized
estone instead of high dosage. Al-Kheetan et al. [5-7] introduced crystalline material along
h a curing compound in fresh concrete to protect and extend its service life and developed
rophobic concrete by adding dual-crystalline admixture during the mixing stage. However,
e are a few materials used in mines backfilling and the research on these materials is limited.
et al. [8] assessed stone powder as a replacement of cement in cemented paste backfill (CPB),
studied strength characteristics and reaction mechanism. The results showed that strength of
backfill greatly reduced at an early stage, and slightly reduced in the final stages, while trans-
e characteristics between pore structure and macroparameters are still needed to be studied.
