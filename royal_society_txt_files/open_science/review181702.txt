This manuscript present a modelling study that aims to look at the effect of trade-offs among
different biological traits on dispersal success over fragmented landscapes. The conclusion seems
to be that “specialist” individuals do better when suitable habitat is not limiting; however, when
the amount of available habitat is very low a “generalist” strategy is better. Unfortunately I am
not sure that this can be concluded from the modelling results as I have reservation on how the
study is constructed and what it actually tells us. I detail some of my concerns below.
I find the manuscript quite confusing in the sense that different concepts are mixed. For example,
the concepts of “specialist” and “generalist” individuals or species are used in an unusual way.
Usually, including in a lot of papers cited, this distinction would refer to use of resource or
adaptation to different environments. Here, it refers to partitions of resources into different traits
to define a “dispersal specialist” or a “dispersal generalist”. However, I fail to see how equal
partition of limited resources to movement speed, anti-predator behaviours, perceptual range,
foraging tendency and minimum area requirement make an individual a “dispersal generalist”.
What is reasoning behind it? For example, what does area requirement have to do with dispersal
specialism? And also foraging tendency? It seems to me that two very different concepts are
muddled. This is also clear from the discussion (e.g. lines 270-275): the type of specialisation that
is predicted to make species more sensitive to habitat fragmentation and is causing global decline
of specialist species has little to do with the type of specialisation modelled here.
Regarding more the details of the model, as said above I do not understand the choice of traits.
Fine for movement speed, per-step mortality and perceptual range, but why foraging tendency
and area requirement? Higher foraging tendency will inevitably slow dispersal down and
therefore reduce dispersal success given that individuals have only a limited amount of steps.
Additionally, as far as I understood there is no benefit in foraging more so this is bound to have a
negative effect; also, foraging vs. dispersal is unlikely to be an intrinsic trade-off but rather a
different behavioural mode. Minimum area requirement I do not understand. What is the optimal
value anyway? For the three traits that are actually related to dispersal also I’m not sure what is
the reasoning behind a trade-off between movement speed and perceptual range. If anything
they should be positively correlated. The results then are inevitably obvious: anything that
reduces movement speed and increases per-step mortality reduces dispersal success, and this is
true across different landscapes, although perceptual range becomes a bit more important where
habitat availability is low. But this we knew already and showing this it is not the main objective,
at least as it is written, of the current manuscript.
Personally I would suggest re-focusing the study on looking at the relative importance of
different traits on dispersal success on landscape with different levels of fragmentation and drop
the “specialism” vs. “generalism” angle, which in my opinion muddles the water. But in that case
attention should be paid on what has already been done.
Specific comments:
- I’m not sure why the use of the term “intrinsic” biological traits and not just biological traits.
- Generally I feel like references to a lot of key literature on dispersal theory and modelling is
missing. For example, there is a lot of theoretical modelling done on dispersal success and
dispersal evolution (hence highlighting which traits and trade-offs may evolve and be important)
on fragmented landscapes which is not mentioned at all, while the focus is more on papers that
have looked at functional connectivity, which is fine but it is a bit like skipping the basis of the
should motivate the study.
- I wouldn’t mix trade-offs with behavioural syndromes. Syndromes are suites of correlated
3
traits; trade-offs may be a part of it but some traits can also be positively correlated.
- Line 152: again I find the all definition of trait optimization (and consequent trade-off) very
odd. A high movement speed, a large vs small area requirement, an excessively large perceptual
range, might not be “optimal” so how do you then define a trade-off among them?
- Line 175: I’m not sure I would draw that conclusion from figure 2. In my opinion these results
tell us that movement speed and per-step mortality are the most important traits among the one
considered and anything that reduce/increase them reduces dispersal success. This is different
conceptually from “specialism” vs. “generalism”. It follows that results at lines 182-184 are not
actually counterintuitive.
I hope my comments will be helpful.

Summary of paper
Atkins et al. used a spatially explicit, individual-based modelling approach to
examine how trade-offs between intrinsic biological traits (n = 9 traits describing
movement ability, perceptual ability, foraging behaviour and minimum area
requirements) affected dispersal success in simulated landscapes that comprised
varying proportions of habitat amount and habitat fragmentation. The main result is
that dispersal success is higher for trait generalists when habitat availability is low,
but when there is sufficient habitat availability then anti-predator adaptations (as
captured by lower per-step mortality) and faster movement increases dispersal
success. More broadly, these results demonstrate how landscape context plays an
important role in determining which combination of traits (in terms of relative
investment) are the most important predictors of dispersal success.
General comments
I think the paper is well written and enjoyed reading it, and it provides a valuable
contribution to the field. The result that generalist species fare better during
dispersal is intuitive, although it might be argued that this finding is also not
particularly novel. On the other hand, I think that it provides some good theoretical
support for a pattern that is often observed using observational data. My main
criticism is that some sections need to be clarified, in particular I felt that there was
some confusion between the implications of the results for individual behaviour vs
species adaptations.
Introduction: I found the introduction well written and well referenced. It also does
a good job of justifying the motivation behind the work and its relevance. Some
clarification is needed so that the distinction between individuals and species is
differentiated.
Methods: Again the Methods are well written, very few comments.
Results: The results are also well written and I think the interpretation of results are
valid
Discussion: Some clarification needed, see individual comments.
Line by line comments
Title: I felt the title was unclear and did not do justice to what is otherwise a nice
study, I suggest it is re-worded for clarity. Suggest something like “The importance
of context: trade-offs among intrinsic biological traits interact with landscape
structure to determine dispersal success”
Line 20 of Summary: I think some clarification is needed here to summarise the nine
biological traits that were examined, (i.e. mostly movement related but also include
resource use (foraging) and perceptual abilities).
Line 25 of Summary: As before I think these needs clarification, for example
‘individuals with more equitable combinations of the nine intrinsic biological traits’.
Lines 25 – 29 of Summary: This is a very broad and general statement. I’m not
suggesting you remove it necessarily but could you also make a brief statement of
how the results have relevance for applied ecology/conservation? I think this is
important because the paper is framed from a conservation perspective (e.g. lines 1
– 5 of Introduction).
Lines 34 – 35: I feel there is a mismatch here between ‘organisms’, which I
understand to mean individuals, and then ‘species’. My interpretation is the
paragraph is explicitly talking about how traits and trait allocation differs between
species, not among individuals within a species. I think this problem also happens
later leading to some confusing interpretation of results in the Discussion (see later
comments re. lines 275 – 281).
Lines 50 – 53: I also feel that using the word ‘animal’ causes confusion here, moving
from talking about ‘behaviour’ at an individual level, to an ‘animals’ niche, which is
specific to the species, not the individual. Some re-writing could provide clarity.
Line 180: Is there evidence that these traits would actually result in tradeoffs? I’m
not sure minimum area requirements and perceptual range would tradeoff
Line 212: I’m not sure a ‘specialised generalist’ is a good way to describe this result
and I don’t think this adds much here, perhaps remove?
Line 236: I think ‘dispersal ability’ should be changed to ‘dispersal success’ here for
consistency
Line 244: Reference to Bonte et al. 2012 is in incorrect format
Line 253: I think I understand here that specialising in traits that don’t improve
dispersal success on average actually results in a cost, but the line seemingly
contradicts itself. Can it be re-worded for clarity?
Line 274: Typo ‘show an high’
Line 275 - 281: Although I agree that organisms (individuals) may well change their
dispersal behaviour (which I interpret as behavioural plasticity) depending on
external conditions such as landscape context, I don’t agree that your results
support the existence of behavioural plasticity per se, because individual behaviour
in your models was fixed after initialisation. Perhaps I have misunderstood your
argument but I think this requires more clarification before you can link your results
and behavioural plasticity in individuals. I think the results are more relevant to how
species allocate traits in different proportions, and how this determines dispersal
success of a species under different landscape contexts.
Lines 295 – 305: I think it is good to acknowledge the general limitations of a
modeling approach, but it would be better to go a little further and give examples of
where some of your assumptions might be invalid, and briefly discuss how this
might impact on results. For example, density dependency in settlement is likely to
be an important factor that is not accounted for in your model – if an individual
arrives at a patch and the patch is already occupied to carrying capacity, then the
individual will be forced to continue to disperse and look for another patch. The
software RangeShifter (Bocedi et al. 2014) can account for this, and it might be
worth discussing the advantages and disadvantages of using netlogo instead of
RangeShifter.

Dear Professor Sanders,
Thank you for the opportunity to resubmit a revision of our manuscript
original research article entitled “The importance of context: landscape
structure influences the outcome of trade-offs among intrinsic biological
traits on dispersal success” for consideration for publication in Royal Society
Open Science. We greatly appreciate the helpful feedback from both
reviewers and have carefully considered and addressed all of their comments.
We believe our resubmission is much improved as a result. We are, of course,
very willing to make additional amendments if necessary, but hope that the
manuscript will now be deemed suitable for publication in Royal Society Open
Science.
Below, we append our detailed responses to the comments and suggestions,
which we have numbered for ease of reference (original or paraphrased
comments are reproduced in plain font, while our responses are indented
beneath in >>>blue). Where appropriate, corresponding changes to the
manuscript are likewise shown in blue font in the revised text for ease of
identification.
Sincerely,
Justine Atkins (on behalf of all co-authors)
1. There were several comments from both Reviewers about major points
that required clarification, many of which related to the overall focus
of the manuscript. Due to the overlapping nature of many of these
comments and our responses to them in the revision, we will address
them together. A summary of these comments are presented below (in
some cases they have been paraphrased), followed by an outline of
how we have addressed these concerns in our resubmission.
a) Both Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 pointed out that the way in which
the terms “specialist” and “generalist” were applied in our original
submission was unusual and confusing. This was a concern
highlighted throughout the manuscript.
b) Reviewer 1 suggested “re-focusing the study on looking at the
relative importance of different traits on dispersal success on
landscape with different levels of fragmentation and drop the
“specialism” vs. “generalism” angle…”
c) Reviewer 2 pointed out that “these results demonstrate how
landscape context plays an important role in determining which
combination of traits (in terms of relative investment) are the most
important predictors of dispersal success.”
d) Reviewer 1: “Generally I feel like references to a lot of key
literature on dispersal theory and modelling is missing. For
example, there is a lot of theoretical modelling done on dispersal
success and dispersal evolution (hence highlighting which traits
and trade-offs may evolve and be important) on fragmented
landscapes which is not mentioned at all, while the focus is more
on papers that have looked at functional connectivity, which is fine
but it is a bit like skipping the basis of the should motivate the
study.”
e) Reviewer 1: “Regarding more the details of the model, as said
above I do not understand the choice of traits.”
f) Reviewer 1: “I wouldn’t mix trade-offs with behavioural
syndromes. Syndromes are suites of correlated traits; trade-offs
may be a part of it but some traits can also be positively
correlated.”
g) Reviewer 1: “Line 52: again I find the all definition of trait
optimization (and consequent trade-off) very odd. A high
movement speed, a large vs small area requirement, an excessively
large perceptual range, might not be “optimal” so how do you then
define a trade-off among them?”
h) Reviewer 1: “Line 75: I’m not sure I would draw that conclusion
from figure 2. In my opinion these results tell us that movement
speed and per-step mortality are the most important traits among
the one considered and anything that reduce/increase them reduces
dispersal success. This is different conceptually from “specialism”
vs. “generalism”. It follows that results at lines 82-84 are not
actually counterintuitive.”
i) Reviewer 2: “Line 22: I’m not sure a ‘specialised generalist’ is a
good way to describe this result and I don’t think this adds much
here, perhaps remove?”
j) Reviewer 2: “Lines 34 – 35: I feel there is a mismatch here
between ‘organisms’, which I understand to mean individuals, and
then ‘species’. My interpretation is the paragraph is explicitly
talking about how traits and trait allocation differs between
species, not among individuals within a species. I think this
problem also happens later leading to some confusing
interpretation of results in the Discussion (see later comments re.
lines 275 – 28).”
k) Reviewer 2: “Line 275 – 28: Although I agree that organisms
(individuals) may well change their dispersal behaviour (which I
interpret as behavioural plasticity) depending on external
conditions such as landscape context, I don’t agree that your
results support the existence of behavioural plasticity per se,
because individual behaviour in your models was fixed after
initialisation. Perhaps I have misunderstood your argument but I
think this requires more clarification before you can link your
results and behavioural plasticity in individuals. I think the results
are more relevant to how species allocate traits in different
proportions, and how this determines dispersal success of a species
under different landscape contexts.”
l) Reviewer 2: “Line 80: Is there evidence that these traits would
actually result in tradeoffs? I’m not sure minimum area
requirements and perceptual range would tradeoff”
m) Reviewer 2: “Line 20 of Summary: I think some clarification is
needed here to summarise the nine biological traits that were
examined, (i.e. mostly movement related but also include resource
use (foraging) and perceptual abilities).”
n) Reviewer 2: “Line 25 of Summary: As before I think these needs
clarification, for example ‘individuals with more equitable
combinations of the nine intrinsic biological traits’.”
>>> To address these concerns, we have clarified the focus of our
manuscript to better align with our model design, analysis and results,
in line with the suggestion of Reviewer (comment b) and the similar
comment from Reviewer 2 (comment c).
Our resubmission focuses on evolutionary trade-offs in the context of
dispersal, i.e. trade-offs among biological traits that occur at the
species level rather than at the level of the individual, and the potential
for mismatches between evolved dispersal traits and contemporary
environmental changes. We have changed the manuscript title to
reflect this focus and it is now: “Effects of mismatches between
dispersal traits and landscape structure on dispersal success in
fragmented landscapes”. The revised introduction still begins by
setting up the importance of dispersal behavior as an area of study, the
influence of internal and external factors on this process, and the role
of landscape fragmentation in relation to dispersal. We then more
thoroughly outline dispersal evolution and evolutionary trade-offs, and
the importance of environmental context to these processes. In
particular, we highlight the broad background of theoretical and
empirical work on the evolution of dispersal and outline specific
predictions from the existing literature regarding the consequences of
increasing habitat fragmentation for dispersal success. In doing so, we
believe we now provide a better context our focus on individual traits,
and for the particular biological traits we chose to consider (Lines 29 –
66; Lines 03 – 09 in the resubmission).
In addition, the Reviewers made several more specific comments
about our chosen suite of biological traits, and the justification for
examining trade-offs between them (comments e, g, h, l-n). We thank
the Reviewers for the opportunity to clarify our model design and have
made several changes throughout the revision to address these
concerns, both outlining why we chose these specific traits and why
we analyzed the relationships between these traits with our chosen
methods:
Lines 20 – 23 “We specifically chose traits known to influence
dispersal success: speed of movement, perceptual range, risk of
predation, need to forage during dispersal, and amount of suitable
habitat required for successful settlement in a patch.”
Lines 72 – 76 “Nevertheless, the potential combinations of traits and
environmental conditions to be considered present such a vast
parameter space that more theoretical approaches must be considered
to: i) provide support for observational patterns and ii) identify which
biological traits and/or dispersal syndromes will be selected for under
increasing fragmentation.”
Lines 89-02 “We focus on the transient stage of dispersal (i.e., when
the organism has departed the origin patch and before it reaches the
settlement patch) as this is the stage for which the consequences of
fragmentation (i.e. increased costs) are likely to be most immediately
influential [7,23]. We assess the role of landscape context in
determining which combination of traits (in terms of relative
evolutionary investment) are the most important predictors of dispersal
success (which we define as the event of an organism moving from
one habitat patch to another without suffering mortality). With this
model design, we aim to provide theoretical support for trends
identified from observational data, illustrating which biological traits
may be selected for under increasing fragmentation and the potential
for disruptive selection on alternate dispersal syndromes. The traits
we examine may vary both within- and between-species; thus, the
results of our simulations can be used to identify both species that may
have a selective advantage under increasing habitat fragmentation, and
particular phenotypes, or dispersal syndromes, within a species that
may be more successful in these scenarios.”
Lines 03-07 “We assessed five biological traits that are likely to
influence dispersal success in fragmented landscapes (see [7,53]), and
therefore likely to be under selection pressure in changing
environments: movement speed, perceptual range, mortality rate
during dispersal (as a proxy for predation risk/investment in anti-
predator strategies), minimum habitat area requirements, and tendency
to forage during dispersal.”
Additions to the trait descriptions in Table 2.
We acknowledge in some cases that the specific trade-off between
certain biological traits may seem unrealistic; however, our intent was
to design a model and analysis protocol that would allow exploration
of a broad parameter space, rather than specific ‘optimal’
combinations of parameters. In part, this is due to our assertion that
what is ‘optimal’ varies greatly from species to species, and from
environment to environment. Line 26-220 “Unlike the parameter-
space evaluation described for the first set of experiments, our trait-
investment analysis did not permit individuals to optimize multiple
traits concurrently – rather, investment in one biological trait equated
to less investment in the other traits. This approach allowed us to
examine how the strategy of investment (generalist vs. specific) and
investment in specific traits influenced dispersal success.”
We have removed any association with the terms “specialist” or
“generalist” and instead discuss specifically how landscape context
can mediate which evolutionary trade-off is actually most beneficial
for dispersal success (Lines 29 – 66).
We agree with comments from j and k concerning confusion around
our references to individuals vs. species, and the reference to within-
species or individual-level plasticity. Wherever possible, we have
attempted to clearly state that our study examines evolutionary trade-
offs at the species-level, within which there can be some degree of
variation among individuals of the same species/population (see Lines
35 – 59). We have clarified all references (either explicit or vague) to
individual-level plasticity.
In addition to these changes, we have moved some analyses from the
supplementary material to the main text to provide additional
information on the effect of each biological trait on dispersal success
under constant environmental conditions (Figure 2 and Methods Lines
80 – 209).
The discussion now focuses closely on contextualizing our results in
the broader literature on the evolution of dispersal and the potential for
misalignment among dispersal-related biological traits and changing
environmental conditions (Lines 356 –394).
2. Reviewer 2: “Lines 25 – 29 of Summary: This is a very broad and
general statement. I’m not suggesting you remove it necessarily but
could you also make a brief statement of how the results have
relevance for applied ecology/conservation? I think this is important
because the paper is framed from a conservation perspective (e.g. lines
1 – 5 of Introduction).”
>>> Thank you for this helpful suggestion. We have updated
this section of the Summary. Lines 31-33 now read: “. In an
applied sense, our results indicate potential for ecological
misalignment between species’ evolved suites of dispersal-
related traits and altered environmental conditions as a result of
rapid global change.”
3. Reviewer 2: “Lines 50 – 53: I also feel that using the word ‘animal’
causes confusion here, moving from talking about ‘behaviour’ at an
individual level, to an ‘animals’ niche, which is specific to the species,
not the individual. Some re-writing could provide clarity.”
>>> Thank you. We have re-worded this section for clarity.
4. Reviewer 2: “Line 236: I think ‘dispersal ability’ should be changed to
‘dispersal success’ here for consistency”
>>> Thank you. We have made the suggested change.
5. Reviewer 2: “Line 244: Reference to Bonte et al. 2012 is in incorrect
format”
>>> Thank you. We have corrected the reference format.
6. Reviewer 2: “Line 274: Typo ‘show an high’”
>>> Thank you. We have corrected this typo.
7. Reviewer 2: “Lines 295 – 305: I think it is good to acknowledge the
general limitations of a modeling approach, but it would be better to
go a little further and give examples of where some of your
assumptions might be invalid, and briefly discuss how this might
impact on results. For example, density dependency in settlement is
likely to be an important factor that is not accounted for in your model
– if an individual arrives at a patch and the patch is already occupied to
carrying capacity, then the individual will be forced to continue to
disperse and look for another patch. The software RangeShifter
(Bocedi et al. 2014) can account for this, and it might be worth
discussing the advantages and disadvantages of using netlogo instead
of RangeShifter.”
>>> We appreciate this helpful suggestion. We have modified
our discussion of model limitations in line with the Reviewer’s
comments, both expanding our original statements about
general model limitations and adding some specific
information on the limitations in our model and areas for
improvement (Lines 410-444).
