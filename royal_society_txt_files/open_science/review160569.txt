COMMENTS
The authors have used a novel gaze-contingent display to decipher whether the attentional
selection of the eye and head movements are common or separate. They conclude that eye
movements are typically made in the direction where information is available, while the head
movements are in the direction which allows exploration of unknown areas. While the paper is
well written and proposes an interesting idea, it has several lacunae which should be addressed
before the paper is accepted.
Introduction
(Lines 41-43) The references cited have all used mouse movements which arguably are
not naturalistic (Gopal and Murthy 2016), hence it might not be reasonable to claim that “motoric
selection process is largely decoupled from perceptual selection”. Notably, Song et al. (2008) and
Song and McPeek (2009) using reaching movements have suggested common target selection of
eye and hand.
(Lines 46-48) The authors claim that in a “naturalistic setting the features driving
selection are often less clearly defined”. This might not be true. For example when an individual
is thirsty he/she will search for water. So selection will be both top-down and bottom-up.
Methods
What was the sampling frequency of the eye and head movements?
(Line 139-140) Meaning of “Both raw and displayed (smoothed) coordinates were
recorded at a rate of 60 Hz”?
(Line 146-147) If the participants’ heads were stabilised by a chin and forehead rest then
how where the head movements ‘naturalistic’?
How many participants performed the eye and head-shift experiments?
How were eye and head movements detected?
What were the statistical analyses used?
How did the subjects respond to the ‘yes/no’ questions? Was there a feedback
depending on the answer?
How many trials did each subject perform? How many times was each image displayed
to a subject?
What was the latency in the shift of the images based on the shift in the eye/head
movements?
Results and figures
The main result of the paper is based on the angular distribution of gaze movements, but
this calculation has been briefly mentioned in the results (lines 160-165). This should be
mentioned clearly in the methods section along with a figure. The calculation of head angular
distribution is also not clear. An example figure would help.
(Lines 166-168) The vector angles are probably not mentioned correctly. The cut-off angle
is mentioned as ±3p/8 which is 67.5 deg. This would mean that the horizontal and vertical cut-
offs were overlapping.
(Lines 169-171) Calculation of ‘bias’ should be clearly mentioned in the methods section.
What does the terms ‘between’ and ‘within’ mentioned in the lines172-173 mean?
3
Figure 3 and 4 shows that there is a bias for eye in the open condition. The reason for this
should be discussed.
The authors note on page 10 that “head movements are not guaranteed in the open
condition”. Notably the results in the open and square conditions are quite distinct especially for
the head. What might be the reason for this discrepancy? Further, does the observation that head
movements are not guaranteed in the open condition go against the conclusion that head
movements are used for exploration?
(Lines 202-203) The switch in bias that is seen between the vertical and horizontal
condition is far more prominent for head movements than the eye movements. What might be
the reason for this observation?
(Lines 212-214) The effect for eye is really minute. What might be the reason for this? Are
conclusions reasonable based on such borderline effects?
The statistical analysis used should be clearly mentioned in the methods namely: Was
normality checked in the data? Were the t-tests one-tailed or two-tailed? If one-tailed the rationale
should be mentioned.
Individual subject data points should be shown in each figure, instead of a bar plot
which hides every detail of the underlying distribution other than the mean.
Discussion
The authors claim that “overt attentional orienting is guided differently based on the
particular effector being used”. However, the analyses were done on separate experimental
condition namely where the window shifted depending on the saccade or head movement. A
more reasonable approach might be to check the movement of the eye and head in the same
experiment. According to the current claims of the paper the movement direction of the eye and
head should be orthogonal to each other in each experimental condition.
(Lines 265-268) The authors note that “Without a restricted aperture, participants moved
their head up and down more often than they moved it left or right, presumably because this
allowed interesting points to be perceived in peripheral vision and exploited by horizontal eye
movements”. This explanation is not too convincing. Could this result stem from the chin and
forehead rest used?
It is not clear why vertical saccades might not be used for exploration instead of “coarse”
head movements. This should be discussed.
The authors argue that free viewing is intentional, but both top-down and bottom-up
processes presumably should be active during exploratory orienting, especially if the display
images are novel.
Supplementary information
The data made available is difficult to interpret as it has not been clearly mentioned what
the numbers for the windows mean.
It would probably be better if some sample eye fixation and head movement figures are
shown which makes the interpretation of the results easier.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This is a detailed, clearly written study addressing the question as to whether eye and head
movements serve different roles in visual selection. The study is methodologically sound and a
large sample size has been used but I have concerns over the main conclusions made from the
study.
In the open condition, with no gaze contingent window, eye movements were primarily along
the horizontal axis and head movements along the vertical axis. This matches the pattern
observed during a standard reading task (Proudlock et al., 2003) where small horizontal head
movements are made but larger slow vertical head movements act to reduce vertical eye
movements. The possible reasons for this are discussed in the study.
Clearly reading is different to visual search in that it necessitates and is dominated by horizontal
eye movements. However, the similar patterns observed raises the possibility that slow vertical
head movements are made during the open and horizontal window tasks to reduce vertical
angles of the eyes allowing mainly horizontal eye movements to do most of the searching. This is
not inconsistent with the overall conclusion of the head exploring new regions but adds
specificity in that mainly vertical head movements are made to unexplored regions in the open
and horizontal conditions.
Although the eye contingent task is an eye movement only task (with the head stabilized), the
head contingent task is not a ‘head movement only’ task and both eye and head movements can
be made to search. However, during the square and vertical head task the use of horizontal eye
movements for searching is restricted and so head movements must be employed to search. The
patterns here could be explained, not so much by the head moving to unexplored areas, but
because there is no alternative than for the head to do the searching in the horizontal direction.
During the eye tasks, since the window moves with the eyes, horizontal eye movements can be
used throughout.
One way to explore this alternative is to observe the eye movement patterns during the head
contingent task. During the open task do the patterns look similar to that observed during
reading where slow vertical head movements are used making the eye movement search task
mainly horizontal? This should be possible to do on a subset of the sample using the EyeLink
1000 in combination with head tracking.
It would important to discuss these alternative reasons for the patterns observed.
Other minor points
Can the authors confirm that the visual search stimuli and window covered the same field of
view? This is implied but I notice that the diagonal visual angles subtended by the two set-ups
are different (42.9° for the eye set-up and 58.4° for the head set-up if my calculations are correct).
5
Can the authors provide any information of the delay introduced through the two setups
between eye and head movements and the eye/head contingent window update? Does the use of
video projector generate any delay issues?
What are the units of angular distribution used in figure 2 (i.e. what do the circles represent) and
how was angular distribution measured (e.g. range)?
Word “of” needed in line 74.

The paper has sufficiently addressed my concerns and hence I support its publication. There are
couple of minor comments:
1) Line 38: Formatting of the citations may be improper. In addition to papers by Song
which have suggested common target selection for eye and hand, probably it might be a good
idea to cite Gopal et al (2015) who has shown that movement preparation of eye and had may be
common.

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-160569.R1)
Thank you for the positive response. The requested small changes have now been made,
including the addition of the new reference suggested in Reviewer 1's point #1.
With respect to Reviewer 1's point #5 ("Was the acceleration threshold 8000°/s or 800°/s? 8000°/s
seems unusually large."), we note that the value has been verified, but that the units were mis-
stated as °/s, where they should be °/s^2. Whereas 8000°/s would be an exceedingly large
velocity, 8000°/s^2 is not an unusually large value for acceleration.
Sincerely,

authors have used a novel gaze-contingent display to decipher whether the attentional selection of the
and head movements are common or separate. They conclude that eye movements are typically made
he direction where information is available, while the head movements are in the direction which
ws exploration of unknown areas. While the paper is well written and proposes an interesting idea, it
several lacunae which should be addressed before the paper is accepted.
oduction
(Lines 41-43) The references cited have all used mouse movements which arguably are not
ralistic (Gopal and Murthy 2016), hence it might not be reasonable to claim that “motoric selection
cess is largely decoupled from perceptual selection”. Notably, Song et al. (2008) and Song and
Peek (2009) using reaching movements have suggested common target selection of eye and hand.
tion: It was not our intent to suggest that different effectors are necessarily decoupled, but
er that they are not necessarily coupled, as indicated by the cited examples (which
lectively include body-movements, head-movements, eye-movements, hand-movements,
mouse-movements). We now include a statement acknowledging this more clearly (lines
39).
(Lines 46-48) The authors claim that in a “naturalistic setting the features driving selection are often
clearly defined”. This might not be true. For example when an individual is thirsty he/she will search
water. So selection will be both top-down and bottom-up.
tion: Certainly orienting in naturalistic settings will involve both featural and top-down
dance. We did not mean to suggest that such settings excluded bottom-up features
right, but rather that the strength of influence of such factors is attenuated by a host of
itional top-down effects. We now include a statement to clarify (line 51).
hods
What was the sampling frequency of the eye and head movements?
tion: Eye-position was sampled at 1000Hz, and head position at 100Hz. This is now
ed on lines 144-145.
(Line 139-140) Meaning of “Both raw and displayed (smoothed) coordinates were recorded at a rate
0 Hz”?
tion: We have now clarified that ‘raw’ refers to the unsmoothed coordinates directly from
eye-tracker or motion tracker, while the ‘displayed’ coordinates were those temporally
oothed to reduce jitter (lines 145-148).
(Line 146-147) If the participants’ heads were stabilized by a chin and forehead rest then how where
head movements ‘naturalistic’?
sponse: The head was stabilized only in the eye contingent apparatus. The head was
mpletely free in the head contingent apparatus.
How many participants performed the eye and head-shift experiments?
sponse: Participant numbers (40 total, 20 per effector condition) are indicated in the
ticipants section of the methods (line 125). This has now been clarified to indicate 20 per
ector condition.
How were eye and head movements detected?
tion: We now provide additional detail for the eye movement detection (using SR
earch’s defaults) in the Eye contingent apparatus section (lines 161-164). Head
vement detection is described in lines 172-176)
What were the statistical analyses used?
sponse: Statistical tests are indicated in the results section. For horizontal bias measures,
used mixed factors and repeated measures analysis of variance and associated contrasts
es 210-212, 215-217; 220-221). Axis congruency was evaluated using single-sample t-
s against 0 (lines 263-264).
How did the subjects respond to the ‘yes/no’ questions? Was there a feedback depending on the
wer?
tion: We now include these response details in the Displays and Procedures section of the
thods (lines 139-140).
How many trials did each subject perform? How many times was each image displayed to a subject?
tion: Each participant completed 40 trials, with 10 images per window condition, which
now clarify on line 133. Images were not repeated.
What was the latency in the shift of the images based on the shift in the eye/head movements?
tion: Approximate latencies are now indicated on lines 148-150.
ults and figures
The main result of the paper is based on the angular distribution of gaze movements, but this
ulation has been briefly mentioned in the results (lines 160-165). This should be mentioned clearly in
methods section along with a figure. The calculation of head angular distribution is also not clear. An
mple figure would help.
tion: We now provide greater detail for the calculation of the gaze movements
ributions shown in Figure 2 (lines 179-184, Figure 2 caption). We also include an
strative Figure clarifying the head movement calculation (Figure S2).
(Lines 166-168) The vector angles are probably not mentioned correctly. The cut-off angle is
tioned as ±3p/8 which is 67.5 deg. This would mean that the horizontal and vertical cut-offs were
rlapping.
tion: Thank you for this observation. We have now corrected these values (which
oneously indicated the entire range as opposed to the <U+F0B1> values). The correct values are
<U+F070>/16 (lines 195-196).
(Lines 169-171) Calculation of ‘bias’ should be clearly mentioned in the methods section.
tion: We now combine all of our measure descriptions in a single ‘Analysis’ section
hin the methods. Horizontal bias calculation is now more clearly described in this section
es 196-198).
What does the terms ‘between’ and ‘within’ mentioned in the lines172-173 mean?
tion: We now add ‘subjects’ to the end of these terms to clarify that these are the
egories of the factors (i.e., the effector condition was varied between subjects and the
dow condition was varied within subjects) (lines 211-212).
Figure 3 and 4 shows that there is a bias for eye in the open condition. The reason for this should be
ussed.
The authors note on page 10 that “head movements are not guaranteed in the open condition”.
ably the results in the open and square conditions are quite distinct especially for the head. What
ht be the reason for this discrepancy?
Further, does the observation that head movements are not guaranteed in the open condition go
inst the conclusion that head movements are used for exploration?
tion: The foregoing three concerns are, we believe, closely related. We have now
anded our discussion (lines 330-368) in the aims of clarifying the details and nuances of
data (and our interpretations), including the particular patterns the reviewer notes. In
ef, although one might expect the open condition to contain few head movements and
iased eye movements, that is not what is observed. Instead, unrestricted viewers make a
jority of horizontal eye movements (which replicates previous work) and more vertical
n horizontal head movements. We argue that this is partly because the natural field of
w is asymmetric (visibility is greater along the horizontal axis; unlike the square
dition).
(Lines 202-203) The switch in bias that is seen between the vertical and horizontal condition is far
e prominent for head movements than the eye movements. What might be the reason for this
ervation?
tion: We now include explicit discussion of this difference in effect size (lines 304-314).
brief, we note that eye-movements may be more difficult to control voluntarily than are
d movements, so that the underlying horizontal bias in eye-movements is more resistant
xperimental manipulations.
(Lines 212-214) The effect for eye is really minute. What might be the reason for this? Are
clusions reasonable based on such borderline effects?
sponse: We agree that the absolute difference is small – particularly seen against the quite
e effect seen in head-movements. However, the eye-movement effect is a direct
lication of Foulsham, Teszka, & Kingstone (2011), and with comparable magnitude
hen’s d ~ 0.63), so we are confident the effect is genuine. In response to prior comments,
now provide further discussion of this notable discrepancy in effect magnitudes across
d- and eye-movements (lines 304-314).
The statistical analysis used should be clearly mentioned in the methods namely: Was normality
cked in the data? Were the t-tests one-tailed or two-tailed? If one-tailed the rationale should be
tioned.
tion: Although typical eye-movement metrics (e.g., saccade latencies and amplitudes,
ation durations, etc.) are often positively skewed, normality was not an issue for the
portion-based metrics used here (Nb. average bias scores lay well away from the edges of
range where normality would otherwise be a concern). T-tests were of course two-tailed,
we now note this explicitly (line 263).
Individual subject data points should be shown in each figure, instead of a bar plot which hides every
il of the underlying distribution other than the mean.
tion: We now include individual subject data in both Figure 3 and Figure 4.
cussion
The authors claim that “overt attentional orienting is guided differently based on the particular
ctor being used”. However, the analyses were done on separate experimental condition namely where
window shifted depending on the saccade or head movement. A more reasonable approach might be
heck the movement of the eye and head in the same experiment. According to the current claims of
paper the movement direction of the eye and head should be orthogonal to each other in each
erimental condition.
sponse: We agree that such an experiment would be the ideal case. However, working
hin the limitations of the technology available to us, we believe that evaluating these
ectors separately nonetheless provides valuable insights into orienting behaviours.
(Lines 265-268) The authors note that “Without a restricted aperture, participants moved their head
nd down more often than they moved it left or right, presumably because this allowed interesting
nts to be perceived in peripheral vision and exploited by horizontal eye movements”. This explanation
ot too convincing. Could this result stem from the chin and forehead rest used?
tion: As we have noted above, the chin rest was not in use for the head-contingent
dition. However, we also now provide additional discussion of this effect in the context
horizontal biases traditionally seen in eye-movements (lines 330-344).
It is not clear why vertical saccades might not be used for exploration instead of “coarse” head
vements. This should be discussed.
sponse: Our reasoning is that an eye-movement in any direction (vertical or otherwise), if
directed to a region without prior information, is likely to be imprecise and in some
se ‘wasted’. Better to bring new information to the visual system through a large-scale
ft of the head, allowing the eyes to then select targets for detailed inspection with
cision based on this new information. We have clarified this perspective in the expanded
cussion (lines 330-368).
The authors argue that free viewing is intentional, but both top-down and bottom-up processes
umably should be active during exploratory orienting, especially if the display images are novel.
tion: We now clarify our position (lines 363-368), noting that although bottom-up
uences are certainly influential during scene viewing, gaze shifts are not strictly reflexive
e., they are not completely driven by bottom-up information. Furthermore, by controlling
viewing window in the present study, we explicitly restrict bottom-up influences.
plementary information
The data made available is difficult to interpret as it has not been clearly mentioned what the
bers for the windows mean.
tion: We now provide additional contextualizing and clarifying information for the data
sented in the SM.
It would probably be better if some sample eye fixation and head movement figures are shown which
es the interpretation of the results easier.
tion: We now include example scanpaths as supplementary figures.

s is a detailed, clearly written study addressing the question as to whether eye and head movements
e different roles in visual selection. The study is methodologically sound and a large sample size has
n used but I have concerns over the main conclusions made from the study.
he open condition, with no gaze contingent window, eye movements were primarily along the
zontal axis and head movements along the vertical axis. This matches the pattern observed during a
dard reading task (Proudlock et al., 2003) where small horizontal head movements are made but
er slow vertical head movements act to reduce vertical eye movements. The possible reasons for this
discussed in the study.
arly reading is different to visual search in that it necessitates and is dominated by horizontal eye
vements. However, the similar patterns observed raises the possibility that slow vertical head
vements are made during the open and horizontal window tasks to reduce vertical angles of the eyes
wing mainly horizontal eye movements to do most of the searching. This is not inconsistent with the
rall conclusion of the head exploring new regions but adds specificity in that mainly vertical head
vements are made to unexplored regions in the open and horizontal conditions.
tion: We greatly appreciate the reviewer having noting this related work, and now include
e discussion of this work and its implications (lines 345-368).
hough the eye contingent task is an eye movement only task (with the head stabilized), the head
tingent task is not a ‘head movement only’ task and both eye and head movements can be made to
ch. However, during the square and vertical head task the use of horizontal eye movements for
ching is restricted and so head movements must be employed to search. The patterns here could be
lained, not so much by the head moving to unexplored areas, but because there is no alternative than
the head to do the searching in the horizontal direction. During the eye tasks, since the window moves
h the eyes, horizontal eye movements can be used throughout.
way to explore this alternative is to observe the eye movement patterns during the head contingent
. During the open task do the patterns look similar to that observed during reading where slow vertical
d movements are used making the eye movement search task mainly horizontal? This should be
sible to do on a subset of the sample using the EyeLink 1000 in combination with head tracking.
ould important to discuss these alternative reasons for the patterns observed.
tion: As mentioned above, we now include additional discussion (related in part to the
ding work this reviewer brought to our attention) which addresses these issues (lines 330-
). We should also like to note that, in all windowed conditions, gaze shifts (whether head
ye) are necessary for both horizontal and vertical exploration, as the windows are not
e enough to span either dimension of the image. That head movements are sensitive to
limits of available information is of interest primarily because the eyes do not follow this
tern. Although the head-movement biases are in hindsight predictable, the same reasoning
ht to have applied to the eye-contingent case. And, given these results for eye-
vements, the natural assumption (since the head is traditionally understood to follow the
) would have been that the head should follow the same pattern. Whether the head-
vements are unexpected because of the eye-movements or the eye-movements are
xpected because of the head-movements, in either case we have an informative
raction.
er minor points
the authors confirm that the visual search stimuli and window covered the same field of view? This is
lied but I notice that the diagonal visual angles subtended by the two set-ups are different (42.9° for
eye set-up and 58.4° for the head set-up if my calculations are correct).
tion: We appreciate the attentive read required to have noted this apparent discrepancy.
e difference arises because the two screens were not matched in aspect ratio – whereas the
jection screen had a widescreen aspect, the computer monitor did not. To match the
ect for the images presented, the actual displayed area on the projection screen was
strained horizontally. We now note this minor difference in the methods (lines 169-172).
the authors provide any information of the delay introduced through the two setups between eye and
d movements and the eye/head contingent window update? Does the use of video projector generate
delay issues?
tion: Latency differed slightly between systems (~2ms for the eye-contingent and ~10ms
the head-contingent). However, in both cases the latency of the system was lower than
refresh rate of the screens (60Hz). We now note these details on lines 148-150.
at are the units of angular distribution used in figure 2 (i.e. what do the circles represent) and how was
ular distribution measured (e.g. range)?
tion: We have updated the description of the distribution calculation (lines 183-184) to
rify that these are proportions, and have also updated the figure caption to indicate the
gnitude of the rings (increments of 3% to a maximum of 18% at the outer ring).
rd “of” needed in line 74.
tion: Thank you. This has been corrected.
