The manuscript, “Composition, mineralization potential and release risk of nitrogen in sediments
of plateau fresh lake, a case study in Keluke Lake, China” has potential to make an impact in N-
flux measurements from high altitude lakes; however, the current structure of results in
discussion and (in some cases) discussion in results makes the paper difficult to read.
Additionally, the paper needs to be edited by a native English speaker to correct tense and word
choice errors. Moreover, the comparison to other Chinese lakes is strong, but lacks comparison to
lakes outside of China. This lack of global context prevents the manuscript from having global
impact.
General comment: The authors try to link sediment N flux to eutrophication – yet have no
discussion of water column phosphorus (P) concentrations or P-flux from sediments. A
discussion of P-flux and how it may impact trophic status of lakes is needed, and/or the authors
could use other studies that have done N and P-flux to lend insight on how much P-flux might
occur from sediments of Keluke.
Specific comments are below:
Title: Suggest rephrasing title to, “Composition, mineralization potential, and release risk of
nitrogen in Keluke Lake, China, a freshwater Tibetan Plateau lake” to clarify to the reader that the
data contained in the paper is from Keluke lake, China – then describe where the lake is located.
Additionally, please use “freshwater” instead of “fresh” here and elsewhere throughout the
manuscript to ensure readers clearly understand that the lake is freshwater.
Page 1, line 17: Again, use “freshwater” instead of “fresh” here and elsewhere
Page 1, line 29: Could the authors please quantify “great mineralization potential”? Or
rephrase/combine with the sentence before that quantitatively shows mineralization potential?
Page 1, line 39: Please rephrase the second half of the sentence to clarify to the reader that N can
limit eutrophication in lakes (it is not always the limiting nutrient)
Page 1, line 42: Please rephrase this sentence to indicate that population expansion (not economic)
has rapidly increased. Additionally, please provide a reference for this.
Page 1, line 43: Can the authors list some of the “pollutants” they are referring to here as an
example? Additionally, can the authors provide a reference for this?
Page 1, line 47: Here and elsewhere were qualitative language is used instead of quantitative
langue – can the authors provide a quantitative estimate for what “controlled well” means, and
rephrase the sentence to include that quantitative pollution load reduction?
Page 1, line 51: Can the authors simplify this sentence by stating “Lake sediments represent the
primary source of pollutants in lake ecosystems” or something similar?
Page 1, line 53: Can the authors provide a reference for “sediments usually act as a nitrogen
sink”?
Page 1, line 54: Could the authors rephrase to clarify to the reader that “phytoplankton” or
“primary production” is supported by N sediment flux instead of “trophic status” here?
Page 2, line 13-14: Could the authors be more specific on the types of “plain” and “plateau” lakes
they are referring to? Are the authors referring to “low-land reservoirs” and “high altitude
freshwater lakes”?
Page 2, line 14: Delete “so”
Page 2, line 18: Delete “and the maximum” from the sentence
3
Page 2, line 23: Delete “far beyond”
Page 2 line 25: Here and elsewhere – can the authors provide a quantitative estimate for “huge
sinks of N”?
Page 3, line 21: Can the authors provide a reference for the National Standard Method?
Figure 1- Can the authors use bathymetry colors here (blue to red spectrum, with blue being
deepest)? Additionally, this figure will need a scale bar and North arrow.
Figure 2- The “EX” should be “EN” as per text
Page 5, lines 39-43: The authors state that EN is a transferable inorganic N form, yet SON is an
organic form and included in EN (by the authors)– can the authors clarify this in the paragraph
what they mean by inorganic source?
Additionally, organic sources have recently been recognized to a preferred bio-available source of
N for some phytoplankton (as the authors mention on page 6, line 25). Given the manuscript is
focused on N return from the sediments to support phytoplankton growth and lake trophic
status, the authors could consider arranging the manuscript in a way that focuses less on the N
forms and more on how bio-available that N form is for phytoplankton. Currently, the authors
state the each N fraction is “very important for N cycling” (p5, line 42; p6,line 35) – however from
a lake trophic status viewpoint only N that is bio-available to phytoplankton would be important.
Page 6, line 44: Can the author’s clarify to the reader the bio-availability of HUN as an N form?
This needs to be done for each N fraction reported given the focus on lake eutrophication.
Page 7, line 37-41: Again, the authors need to be quantitative here (and in the paragraph below),
not just qualitative. What are the rates that define each of the three phases?
Page 8, line 19: The method for calculating net N mineralization should be in the methods, not
results. Additionally, the authors introduce the term “leaching” here without an explanation to
the reader of what it means in terms of the method. This must be rectified before publication.
Page 8, Line 26-30: The authors did a nice job in the sentence above to quantify their results, yet
lack that quantification here. Again, the authors need to be quantitative here, not just qualitative.
Page 9, line 20: Again, the authors need to be quantitative in this paragraph, not just qualitative.
What are the rates that define each of the three phases?
Table 1: Table 1 gives context to the author’s work from a Chinese prospective, but does not give
context to how this lake compares to those in other continents. Because this is a global journal,
could the authors add in lakes from other continents/countries? This would broaden the entire
discussion to more than just Chinese lakes, which is needed for a global context.
Additionally, are the trophic status ratings of lakes in Table 1 by TN, TP, Chl-a, Secchi? And what
reference is used to categorize the lakes into trophic status?
Section 4.2 & 4.3: The authors need to place the results of their regression analyses in the results
section, not the discussion.
Page 13, line 4: Again, the authors need to be quantitative with “great” N mineralization
potential.

This article is about the composition, mineralization potential and release risk of nitrogen in
sediments of plateau fresh lake, and the authors used the sediments from Keluke Lake in China
to measure nitrogen fractions. In my opinion, the authors should added some discussion in some
part of this paper. The article is well discussed, and data analysis is clear, genuine and believable.
There are several problems, and the authors should provide some supplements or explanation
with minor revision. I present some suggestions to improve the paper:
The minor problems and suggestions are as follows:
1. The English grammars in the paper need to be checked and corrected preferably by a native
English speaker.
2. Please provide the page numbers.
3. Briefly explain the sequential extraction method of nitrogen in sediments.
4. In the section of Discussion, “4.2 Comparison of nitrogen…” should be revised “4.1….”.
5. Table 1, the authors discussed nitrogen pollution loads from different lakes. But all of the lakes
are from China. Please search and provide information of lakes from other regions in the world.
6. In the section of 4.2 Nitrogen mineralization potential analysis, Table 2 and Table 3 should be
adjusted to Results. The authors can discussed the results from Table 2 and 3 together.
7. The conclusion is different from abstract, and should not be presented some data in this
section. The authors should provide the viewpoints according to the results. In addition, the
author is encouraged to write the conclusion as a whole paragraph, not as a), b), c)…., and please
provide the significance of this study.

In this study, the authors provide a assessment of nitrogen dynamics in the sediment of a plateau
lake in China. They present many descriptive data on sediment N speciation, mineralization
potential, and release flux. It is obvious that a great deal of time and effort went into this research
and manuscript; however, I have serious concerns about its suitability for publication.
Specifically, the methods are not adequately described, the broader implications of the results are
not clear, and the Discussion needs to be restructured (see below for detailed comments). The
manuscript would also greatly benefit from a thorough revision to improve English grammar and
language throughout. Based on these concerns and those listed below, I have to recommend that
your manuscript is not suitable for publication in its current form.
Specific Comments:
It may not be clear to the reader what the plateau lakes are and why they are important when
reading the Abstract (Pg 1, line 18).
The results include a lot of descriptive nitrogen data. However, it is not clear what the “take
home” message is. Can you summarize in a sentence or two what the implications of this study
are at the end of the abstract?
Is it really true that external nitrogen loading has been controlled for most lakes? (Pg 1, line 47)
Can you briefly state the conditions that favor N release from sediment? (Pg1, line 54)
How was it determined that N was the most important factor affecting water quality in the lake?
(Pg 2, line 35)
Many methods are not adequately described. For example, how were sediments and water
samples collected? (Pg 3, line 10) How was NH4=N analyzed (Pg 3, line 20). Were all samples
treated as described in “Sample collection and treatment”? Please add additional details to this
section.
Furthermore, it is not clear what statistics were used and why. Also, in this section (2.6 Statistical
Analysis) it states that all of the above experiments were made in triplicate. Does this mean that
you collected triplicate sediment samples from each site? Was a single sediment sample used for
all analyses? Finally, it is not clear how the samples from the different sites were used in the
statistical analyses. Was each a replicate or did you have replicate sediment/water samples at
each site (Figure 5 and 6 suggest that each sediment sample location was used as a replicate)? (Pg
3, line 51)
Most of the Discussion is written like a Results section. I do not think that new results should be
presented for the first time in the Discussion. For example, if most of page 11, Figure 7, etc. is all
new results. Instead the Discussion should be rewritten to focus on why the results are
important, include a more in depth discussion of how they compare to other studies, and
ultimately a discussion of the broader implications.
6
I appreciate the comparison with other lakes (Table 1). If I am interpreting it correctly, it appears
as though Keluke Lake had the highest sediment TN. However, it was only classified as
mesotrophic. What can explain the high sediment concentrations and mesotrophic classification?
This seems like an interesting point that could use additional discussion.
The conclusion section is mainly a restatement of results and it remains unclear what the broader
implications of the study/results are. The authors need to do a better job of incorporation the
current literature to show why/how these results are important.

Decision letter (RSOS-172252.R0)
23-Feb-2018
Dear Mrs Wang:
Manuscript ID RSOS-172252 entitled "Composition, mineralization potential and release risk of
nitrogen in sediments of plateau fresh lake, a case study in Keluke Lake, China" which you
submitted to Royal Society Open Science, has been reviewed by three independent reviewers.
The comments from reviewers are included at the bottom of this letter.
In view of the criticisms of the reviewers, the manuscript has been rejected in its current form.
However, a new manuscript may be submitted which takes into consideration these comments.
Although all three reviews found a lot that was of interest in your manuscript, they all had
criticism that are sufficiently substantial for me to recommend rejection with resubmission. The
critical issues, apart from the presentation of the manuscript itself, which requires significant
work, are: the qualitative approach to the data, the lack of a broader context and implications and
the absence of some key references. I would urge you to take on board the many, constructive
reviewer comments in putting together a revised manuscript for resubmission.
Please note that resubmitting your manuscript does not guarantee eventual acceptance, and that
your resubmission will be subject to peer review before a decision is made.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Punidan Jeyasingh):
This manuscript reports data on nitrogen fluxes from sediments of a Chinese lake. The study is
rather descriptive in nature, and all 3 expert reviewers raised similar concerns. They have made a
number of suggestions on how to make the manuscript more general, hypothesis-driven, and
quantitative. The comments were fair and constructive. The authors need to revise the
manuscript substantially for it to reach a quality acceptable at RSOS. With much gratitude to the
expert reviewers, I invite the authors to carefully consider these comments to improve this
manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
The revised manuscript, “Composition, mineralization potential, and release risk of nitrogen in
the sediment of Keluke Lake, a Tibetan Plateau freshwater lake in China”, has greatly improved
from the previous version, but still requires work before publication – particularly in the results
section.
Specific comments are below:
Abstract line 29 or at the end of the discussion section: The authors state “managed by applying
appropriate measures” Could the authors here, or at the end of the discussion, give examples of
what measures they are referring to? I.e., alum addition or some other way of capping nutrient
fluxes from the sediment?
P2, line 31: Could the authors specify “national water quality standard” by the nation of origin?
This will help clarify which countries standard the authors are referring to.
P3, line 8: “the highest biodiversity..” can the authors provide a reference here?
P4, line 13: What sort of grab sampler – Ekman, ponar, something else? Please specify.
P5, line 21: Could the authors specify what the abbrev. PMN refers to here? I realize the authors
have defined this in the abstract, but defining PMN again here would help clarify the method to
readers who may only be interested to the method.
P6, line 2-3: The sentence “Evidently, TN in the sediments was in polluted levels, and might cause
certain effects on benthonic organisms” needs to be moved to discussion (or at least deleted here),
where the authors can discuss how TN pollution effects organisms and water quality.
P6, line 9: Do the authors mean “bioavailable” instead of transferable?
P8, lines 20-25: The text starting from “The results are similar…” to “degraded by the
autochthonous group of microbes” is discussion – please move this to the discussion section. In
general, the results section should only present the results of the authors work, not discuss how
or why the results occurred in the way they did or compare the results to other studies. Here and
12
elsewhere, please revise the results section so that only results of the current study are presented.
However, in this reviewer’s opinion, the topic sentences in the results section that describe what
the N-forms represent (e.g., p10 line 26, or p8 line 10, or p7 line 4, etc.) are needed in the results
section to give the reader a brief idea of what the N-form represents in a biologically meaningful
way.
Continued comment- If the text currently in the results that should be moved to the discussion
represents duplicate ideas or text to that already in the discussion, please delete the text from the
manuscript.
Table 3: The addition of lakes from other countries does a nice job of putting the authors work in
context, in addition to providing context to other Chinese lakes.
P14, line 1: The sentence starting with “The TN content in Keluke Lake was also…” should start a
new paragraph.
P14, line 11- Can the authors quantify “plenty”? If not, they authors could state that the Bayin
river loads relatively more sheep and cow dung compared to other lakes – but please provide a
reference.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_6
I appreciate the authors efforts to address the reviewer comments and improve the manuscript.
The English language/grammar is greatly improved; however, I believe that it still needs one
more round of editing to fix minor grammatical errors throughout. Furthermore, I believe that
the manuscript still provides rather site specific information and the broader implications remain
unclear.
I believe that the manuscript still lacks broader impacts in some places. For example, at the end
of the abstract it is noted that nitrogen release threatens the water quality of the lake. Is there a
broader impact of this study beyond Lake Keluke? For example, did you learn anything about
nitrogen dynamics in general.
I appreciate one of the previous reviewer’s comments about phosphorus flux. Although this
paper is not about P, it may be useful to mention P – it is only mentioned in the last sentence of
the manuscript. You may want to mention that we know quite a bit more about P flux from the
sediment than we do about N flux in general somewhere in the Introduction.
Many readers may not be familiar with what the different Classes of lakes are (Line 31). This
needs an explanation and reference to put this in a general context that readers not familiar with
this system can understand. Furthermore, this appears to be presented as evidence that TN is
the main factor limiting water quality – this relationship between the Class system you mention
and TN is not clear. Does the class system exclude phosphorus?
The statistics are not clear. For example, what are the T-Tests used for and how?
The Discussion should not start with new data/information. I suggest that you add to the end of
the Introduction that 4th “task” was to compare your results to other lakes typical of China and
other countries. You could also then introduce this table in the Results section instead of the
starting your Discussion with it. Finally, move this discussion about comparisons with other
lakes to later in the Discussion.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Punidan Jeyasingh):
I thank the authors for a thoroughly revised version that is certainly much improved compared to
the previous one. It was reassessed by the same experts. While all 3 were generally impressed by
the efforts to revise and satisfied with the manuscript, two of them raise some additional key
(and legitimate) issues that need to be resolved before publication. I believe addressing these
issues would improve the manuscript further. With much gratitude to the expert reviewers, I
invite the authors to make these revisions and re-submit another version for review.
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The revised manuscript, “Composition, mineralization potential, and release risk of nitrogen in
the sediment of Keluke Lake, a Tibetan Plateau freshwater lake in China”, has greatly improved
from the previous version, but still requires work before publication – particularly in the results
section.
Specific comments are below:
Abstract line 29 or at the end of the discussion section: The authors state “managed by applying
appropriate measures” Could the authors here, or at the end of the discussion, give examples of
what measures they are referring to? I.e., alum addition or some other way of capping nutrient
fluxes from the sediment?
P2, line 31: Could the authors specify “national water quality standard” by the nation of origin?
This will help clarify which countries standard the authors are referring to.
P3, line 8: “the highest biodiversity..” can the authors provide a reference here?
P4, line 13: What sort of grab sampler – Ekman, ponar, something else? Please specify.
P5, line 21: Could the authors specify what the abbrev. PMN refers to here? I realize the authors
have defined this in the abstract, but defining PMN again here would help clarify the method to
readers who may only be interested to the method.
P6, line 2-3: The sentence “Evidently, TN in the sediments was in polluted levels, and might cause
certain effects on benthonic organisms” needs to be moved to discussion (or at least deleted here),
where the authors can discuss how TN pollution effects organisms and water quality.
P6, line 9: Do the authors mean “bioavailable” instead of transferable?
P8, lines 20-25: The text starting from “The results are similar…” to “degraded by the
autochthonous group of microbes” is discussion – please move this to the discussion section. In
general, the results section should only present the results of the authors work, not discuss how
or why the results occurred in the way they did or compare the results to other studies. Here and
elsewhere, please revise the results section so that only results of the current study are presented.
However, in this reviewer’s opinion, the topic sentences in the results section that describe what
the N-forms represent (e.g., p10 line 26, or p8 line 10, or p7 line 4, etc.) are needed in the results
section to give the reader a brief idea of what the N-form represents in a biologically meaningful
way.
Continued comment- If the text currently in the results that should be moved to the discussion
represents duplicate ideas or text to that already in the discussion, please delete the text from the
manuscript.
17
Table 3: The addition of lakes from other countries does a nice job of putting the authors work in
context, in addition to providing context to other Chinese lakes.
P14, line 1: The sentence starting with “The TN content in Keluke Lake was also…” should start a
new paragraph.
P14, line 11- Can the authors quantify “plenty”? If not, they authors could state that the Bayin
river loads relatively more sheep and cow dung compared to other lakes – but please provide a
reference.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Punidan Jeyasingh):
Associate Editor
Comments to the Author:
I thank the authors for carefully revising the manuscript. It is much improved from the first
version, and is ready for print.
Appendix A
April 16, 2018
Dear Dr. Alice Power, Punidan Jeyasingh and Jon Blundy, and Reviewers:
Thank you for giving us the chance to resubmit our article. We also thank for the
reviewers’ comments concerning our manuscript entitled “Composition,
mineralization potential and release risk of nitrogen in sediments of plateau fresh
lake, a case study in Keluke Lake, China” (ID: RSOS-172252). Those comments are all
valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as the
important guiding significance to our researches. We have studied comments
carefully and have made correction which we hope meet with approval. Revised
portion are marked in red in the paper. The main corrections in the paper and the
responds to the reviewer’s comments are as flowing:
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer 1:
1. The paper needs to be edited by a native English speaker to correct tense and
word choice errors.
Response: We carefully checked the English grammars and syntactical structures in
this whole paper and corrected by a professional English polishing company. The
revised portions were marked in red.
2. The authors try to link sediment N flux to eutrophication – yet have no discussion
of water column phosphorus (P) concentrations or P-flux from sediments. A
discussion of P-flux and how it may impact trophic status of lakes is needed, and/or
the authors could use other studies that have done N and P-flux to lend insight on
how much P-flux might occur from sediments of Keluke.
Response: Research of Zhou et al. showed that the specific pollutants in Keluke Lake
were TN, COD and NH3-N. Content of TN showed an increasing trend from 1.11
mg/L in 2014 to 1.54 mg/L in 2015. However, content of TP was lower than the
limited value of class II water quality standards. Studies of phosphorus in sediments
of Keluke Lake have not been reported yet. We will further study the content,
formation, distribution, and bioavailability of phosphorus in sediments to
comprehensive reveal the impact of sediments on water quality of Keluke Lake
3. Title: Suggest rephrasing title to, “Composition, mineralization potential, and
release risk of nitrogen in Keluke Lake, China, a freshwater Tibetan Plateau lake”.
Response: The title was rephrased to“Composition, mineralization potential and
release risk of nitrogen in the sediments of Keluke Lake, a Tibetan Plateau
freshwater lake in China”.(Page1, Line 1-2)
4. Please use “freshwater” instead of “fresh” here and elsewhere throughout the
manuscript to ensure readers clearly understand that the lake is freshwater.
Response: All “fresh lake” in the manuscript were changed into “freshwater lake”.
(Page1, Line 15<U+3001>17<U+3001>31;Page 2, Line 13<U+3001>15<U+3001>18<U+3001>25)
5. Page 1, line 29: Could the authors please quantify “great mineralization
potential”? Or rephrase/combine with the sentence before that quantitatively
shows mineralization potential?
Response: The “great mineralization potential” was quantified by combined with
the half sentence before. (Page 1, Line 24-25)
6. Page 1, line 39: Please rephrase the second half of the sentence to clarify to the
reader that N can limit eutrophication in lakes (it is not always the limiting nutrient)
Response: The sentence was rephrased. (Page 1, Line 35-36)
7. Page 1, line 42: Please rephrase this sentence to indicate that population
expansion (not economic) has rapidly increased. Additionally, please provide a
reference for this.
Response: This sentence was rephrased, and a reference was provided. (Page 1, Line
40)
8. Page 1, line 43: Can the authors list some of the “pollutants” they are referring to
here as an example? Additionally, can the authors provide a reference for this?
Response: The pollutants were listed and a reference was provided. (Page 1, Line
39)
9. Page 1, line 47: Here and elsewhere were qualitative language is used instead of
quantitative langue – can the authors provide a quantitative estimate for what
“controlled well” means, and rephrase the sentence to include that quantitative
pollution load reduction?
Response: The sentence was omitted for the less rigorous wording.
10. Page 1, line 51: Can the authors simplify this sentence by stating “Lake
sediments represent the primary source of pollutants in lake ecosystems” or
something similar?
Response: The sentence was rewritten according to the Reviewer’s comment. (Page
1, Line 42-43)
11. Page 1, line 53: Can the authors provide a reference for “sediments usually act
as a nitrogen sink”?
Response: The reference was provided. (Page 2, Line 1)
12. Page 1, line 54: Could the authors rephrase to clarify to the reader that
“phytoplankton” or “primary production” is supported by N sediment flux instead of
“trophic status” here?
Response: The sentence was rephrased. (Page 2, Line 2-3)
13. Page 2, line 13-14: Could the authors be more specific on the types of “plain”
and “plateau” lakes they are referring to? Are the authors referring to “low-land
reservoirs” and “high altitude freshwater lakes”?
Response: The lake types of “plain lakes” and “plateau lakes” were described more
specific. (Page 2, Line 13-14)
14. Page 2, line 14: Delete “so”
Response: The “so” was deleted. (Page 2, Line 14)
15. Page 2, line 18: Delete “and the maximum” from the sentence
Response: The “and the maximum” was deleted. (Page 2, Line 17)
16. Page 2, line 23: Delete “far beyond”
Response: The “far beyond” was deleted. (Page 2, Line 21)
17. Page 2 line 25: Here and elsewhere – can the authors provide a quantitative
estimate for “huge sinks of N”?
Response: The sentence here was rephrased. The same situations in the manuscript
were checked and rephrased. (Page 2, Line 23)
18. Page 3, line 21: Can the authors provide a reference for the National Standard
Method?
Response: The relevant reference was provided. (Page 3, Line 23)
19. Figure 1- Can the authors use bathymetry colors here (blue to red spectrum,
with blue being deepest)? Additionally, this figure will need a scale bar and North
arrow.
Response: Figure 1 was redrawn according to the comment. (Page 2, Line 24)
20. Figure 2- The “EX” should be “EN” as per text
Response: The “EX” was revised into “EN” in Figure 2. (Page 6, Line 7)
21. Page 5, lines 39-43: The authors state that EN is a transferable inorganic N form,
yet SON is an organic form and included in EN (by the authors)– can the authors
clarify this in the paragraph what they mean by inorganic source?
Response: The “inorganic nitrogen (IN)” was revised into “nitrogen”. (Page 6, Line
11)
22. Additionally, organic sources have recently been recognized to a preferred bio-
available source of N for some phytoplankton (as the authors mention on page 6,
line 25). Given the manuscript is focused on N return from the sediments to support
phytoplankton growth and lake trophic status, the authors could consider arranging
the manuscript in a way that focuses less on the N forms and more on how bio-
available that N form is for phytoplankton. Currently, the authors state the each N
fraction is “very important for N cycling” (p5, line 42; p6, line 35) – however from a
lake trophic status viewpoint only N that is bio-available to phytoplankton would be
important.
Response: The discussions of the N bioavailability for phytoplankton were enforced.
For most part of HN, the composition and characteristics are still not clear, so we
cannot give very precise definition on their bioavailability. But we tried our best to
give more information.
23. Page 6, line 44: Can the author’s clarify to the reader the bio-availability of HUN
as an N form? This needs to be done for each N fraction reported given the focus on
lake eutrophication.
Response: Now little is known about HUN’s origin, and is not clear in the nature and
characterization. So we cannot give a precise definition on the bioavailability of
HUN. For the N fractions that have been reported as bioavailable were clarified.
24. Page 7, line 37-41: Again, the authors need to be quantitative here (and in the
paragraph below), not just qualitative. What are the rates that define each of the
three phases?
Response: The three phases of change of NH4+-N in studied sediments during
incubation were defined according the relative speed. They were quantitated by
listing the change rates. (Page 8, Line 12-20)
25. Page 8, line 19: The method for calculating net N mineralization should be in the
methods, not results. Additionally, the authors introduce the term “leaching” here
without an explanation to the reader of what it means in terms of the method. This
must be rectified before publication.
Response: The method for calculating the net nitrogen mineralization rate stated in
the results was moved into section 2.5. The “leaching” was changed into
“extraction” to make a better understanding. (Page 5, Line 23-24)
26. Page 8, Line 26-30: The authors did a nice job in the sentence above to quantify
their results, yet lack that quantification here. Again, the authors need to be
quantitative here, not just qualitative.
Response: The sentences were rephrased. (Page 8, Line 20-25)
27. Page 9, line 20: Again, the authors need to be quantitative in this paragraph, not
just qualitative. What are the rates that define each of the three phases?
Response: The three phases of change of SON in studied sediments during
incubation were defined according the relative speed. They were quantitated by
listing the change rates. The change phases of H-ON were also quantitative. (Page
10, Line 2-6,14-18)
28. Table 1: Table 1 gives context to the author’s work from a Chinese prospective,
but does not give context to how this lake compares to those in other continents.
Because this is a global journal, could the authors add in lakes from other
continents/countries? This would broaden the entire discussion to more than just
Chinese lakes, which is needed for a global context.
Response: The lakes from other countries were added in discussion. (Page 12, Table
3; Page 14, Line 4-7)
29. Additionally, are the trophic status ratings of lakes in Table 1 by TN, TP, Chl-a,
Secchi? And what reference is used to categorize the lakes into trophic status?
Response: The trophic status ratings of lakes in Table 1 were calculated by TN, TP,
Chl.a, SD and CODMn according to “Evaluate method and classification standard on
lake eutrophication” proposed by Wang et al. The relevant reference was added in
the manuscript.(Page 13, Line 1)
30. Section 4.2 & 4.3: The authors need to place the results of their regression
analyses in the results section, not the discussion.
Response: The regression analyses in Section 4.2 and 4.3 were adjusted into Section
3 Results and analysis.(Page 10, Line 25 - Page 12, Line 11)
31. Page 13, line 4: Again, the authors need to be quantitative with “great” N
mineralization potential.
Response: The Conclusions were rephrased.
Reviewer 2:
1. The English grammars in the paper need to be checked and corrected preferably
by a native English speaker.
Response: We carefully checked the English grammars and syntactical structures in
this whole paper and corrected by a professional English polishing company. The
revised portions were marked in red.
2. Please provide the page numbers.
Response: The page numbers were provided.
3. Briefly explain the sequential extraction method of nitrogen in sediments.
Response: The sequential extraction method of nitrogen in sediments was
complemented in section 2.3. (Page 4, Line 2-27)
4. In the section of Discussion, “4.2 Comparison of nitrogen…” should be revised
“4.1….”.
Response: The Discussion was rearranged.(Page 12, Line 13)
5. Table 1, the authors discussed nitrogen pollution loads from different lakes. But
all of the lakes are from China. Please search and provide information of lakes from
other regions in the world.
Response: The lakes from other countries were added in discussion. (Page 12, Table
3; Page 14, Line 4-7)
6. In the section of 4.2 Nitrogen mineralization potential analysis, Table 2 and Table
3 should be adjusted to Results. The authors can discussed the results from Table 2
and 3 together.
Response: The section 4.2 was adjusted to Results, and the results was discussed in
Section 4 Discussion. (Page 10, Line 25 - Page 12, Line 11, Page 14, Line 18-40)
7. The conclusion is different from abstract, and should not be presented some data
in this section. The authors should provide the viewpoints according to the results.
In addition, the author is encouraged to write the conclusion as a whole paragraph,
not as a), b), c)…., and please provide the significance of this study.
Response: The conclusion was rewritten according to the comment and the
significant of this study was provided.(Page 15, Line 7-14)
8. Standard error bars should be added in Figures 2, 3, and 4.
Response: The standard error bars were added in Figures 2, 3 and 4. (Page 6, Line 6;
Page 7, Line 1; Page 8, Line 1)
Reviewer 3:
1. The manuscript would also greatly benefit from a thorough revision to improve
English grammar and language throughout.
Response: We carefully checked the English grammars and syntactical structures in
this whole paper and corrected by a professional English polishing company. The
revised portions were marked in red.
2. It may not be clear to the reader what the plateau lakes are and why they are
important when reading the Abstract (Pg 1, line 18).
Response: The implications of this study on the plateau lake were summarized in
the Abstract.(Page 1, Line 11-13)
3. The results include a lot of descriptive nitrogen data. However, it is not clear what
the “take home” message is. Can you summarize in a sentence or two what the
implications of this study are at the end of the abstract?
Response: The implications of this study were summarized at the end of the
abstract. (Page 1, Line 28-30)
4. Is it really true that external nitrogen loading has been controlled for most lakes?
(Pg 1, line 47)
Response: The sentence was omitted for the less rigorous wording.(Page 1, Line 39-
41)
5. Can you briefly state the conditions that favor N release from sediment? (Pg1, line
54)
Response: The conditions beneficial to the nitrogen release from sediments were
stated. (Page 2, Line 2)
6. How was it determined that N was the most important factor affecting water
quality in the lake? (Pg 2, line 35)
Response: The sentence was rewritten.(Page 2, Line 30-33)
7. Many methods are not adequately described. For example, how were sediments
and water samples collected? (Pg 3, line 10) How was NH4=N analyzed (Pg 3, line
20). Were all samples treated as described in “Sample collection and treatment”?
Please add additional details to this section.
Response: The collected methods for sediment and water samples, and the analysis
method of NH4+-N in overlying water and interstitial water samples were
complemented in section 2.2. The sediment samples used for section 2.3 and 2.5
were pretreated as described in “2.2 Sampling collection and treatment”, and the
details for the following steps were adequately described in section 2.3 and 2.5.
(Page 3, Line 13-16; Page 3, Line 27- Page 4, Line 27)
8. Furthermore, it is not clear what statistics were used and why. Also, in this
section (2.6 Statistical Analysis) it states that all of the above experiments were
made in triplicate. Does this mean that you collected triplicate sediment samples
from each site? Was a single sediment sample used for all analyses? Finally, it is not
clear how the samples from the different sites were used in the statistical analyses.
Was each a replicate or did you have replicate sediment/water samples at each site
(Figure 5 and 6 suggest that each sediment sample location was used as a
replicate)? (Pg 3, line 51)
Response: The statistics used for different purpose in the manuscript was stated
more detailed in section 2.6. We collected three sediment samples and mixed them
together as a whole sediment sample for each sampling site. A single sediment
sample was analyzed three times for all the experiments. (Page 5, Line 26-34)
9. Most of the Discussion is written like a Results section. I do not think that new
results should be presented for the first time in the Discussion. For example, if most
of page 11, Figure 7, etc. is all new results. Instead the Discussion should be
rewritten to focus on why the results are important, include a more in depth
discussion of how they compare to other studies, and ultimately a discussion of the
broader implications.
Response: Section 4.2 and 4.3 in the Discussion were adjusted to Results section.
The comparison with other studies was discussed more deeply, and the the
implications of this study were summarized. (Page 10, Line 25 - Page 12, Line 11,
Page 14, Line 18-44; Page 14, Line 1-5)
10. I appreciate the comparison with other lakes (Table 1). If I am interpreting it
correctly, it appears as though Keluke Lake had the highest sediment TN. However,
it was only classified as mesotrophic. What can explain the high sediment
concentrations and mesotrophic classification? This seems like an interesting point
that could use additional discussion.
Response: The possible reasons for the high sediment N concentrations but
mesotropher classification of Keluke Lake were discussed compared with other lakes
on the original basis. (Page 13, Line 3-12; Page 14, Line 1)
11. The conclusion section is mainly a restatement of results and it remains unclear
what the broader implications of the study/results are. The authors need to do a
better job of incorporation the current literature to show why/how these results are
important.
Response: The conclusion was rephrased. The broader implications of this study
were summarized according to the current literature. (Page 15, Line 7-14).
Other changes:
1. The corresponding author was revised in the Title page. (Page 1, Line 3)
2. Another 25 references were added and the order of references was rearranged.
We appreciate for Editors/Reviewers’ warm work earnestly, and hope that the
correction will meet with approval.
Once again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.
Appendix B
Junly 25, 2018
Dear Dr. Andrew Dunn, Punidan Jeyasingh and Jon Blundy, and
Reviewers:
Thank you for giving us the chance to revise our article. We also thank
for the reviewers’ comments concerning our manuscript entitled
“Composition, mineralization potential and release risk of
nitrogen in sediments of plateau fresh lake, a case study in Keluke
Lake, China” (ID: RSOS-180612). Those comments are all valuable
and very helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as the
important guiding significance to our researches. We have studied
comments carefully and have made correction which we hope meet
with approval. Revised portion are marked in red in the paper. The
main corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s
comments are as flowing:
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer 1:
1. Abstract line 29 or at the end of the discussion section: The
authors state “managed by applying appropriate measures” Could
the authors here, or at the end of the discussion, give examples of
what measures they are referring to? I.e., alum addition or some
other way of capping nutrient fluxes from the sediment?
Response: Some examples of the measures were given at the end
of the discussion and conclusion. (Page 15, Line 20-21, 33-34)
2. P2, line 31: Could the authors specify “national water quality
standard” by the nation of origin? This will help clarify which
countries standard the authors are referring to.
Response: The detailed information of the “national water quality
standard” was supplemented. (Page 2, Line 33-35)
3. P3, line 8: “the highest biodiversity..” can the authors provide a
reference here?.
Response: The reference was provided. (Page 3, Line 18)
4. P4, line 13: What sort of grab sampler – Ekman, ponar, something
else? Please specify.
Response: The sort of grab sampler was specified. (Page 3, Line
23)
5. P5, line 21: Could the authors specify what the abbrev. PMN
refers to here? I realize the authors have defined this in the
abstract, but defining PMN again here would help clarify the
method to readers who may only be interested to the method.
Response: PMN was defined again in Section 2.5. (Page 5, Line
35-36)
6. P6, line 2-3: The sentence “Evidently, TN in the sediments was in
polluted levels, and might cause certain effects on benthonic
organisms” needs to be moved to discussion (or at least deleted
here), where the authors can discuss how TN pollution effects
organisms and water quality.
Response: The sentence was deleted. (Page 6, Line 17)
7. P6, line 9: Do the authors mean “bioavailable” instead of
transferable?
Response: “transferable” was revised into “bioavailable”. (Page 6,
Line 26)
8. P8, lines 20-25: The text starting from “The results are similar…”
to “degraded by the autochthonous group of microbes” is
discussion – please move this to the discussion section. In general,
the results section should only present the results of the authors
work, not discuss how or why the results occurred in the way they
did or compare the results to other studies. Here and elsewhere,
please revise the results section so that only results of the current
study are presented. However, in this reviewer’s opinion, the topic
sentences in the results section that describe what the N-forms
represent (e.g., p10 line 26, or p8 line 10, or p7 line 4, etc.) are
needed in the results section to give the reader a brief idea of what
the N-form represents in a biologically meaningful way.
Continued comment- If the text currently in the results that should
be moved to the discussion represents duplicate ideas or text to
that already in the discussion, please delete the text from the
manuscript.
Response: The text starting from “The results are similar…” to
“degraded by the autochthonous group of microbes” was moved
to the discussion section. (Page 14, Line 36-44; Page 15, Line 1-3)
The texts of results section were wholly checked and the
discussions about the results were moved to the Discussion
section. (Page 15, Line 8-13)
9. P14, line 1: The sentence starting with “The TN content in Keluke
Lake was also…” should start a new paragraph.
Response: The sentence starting with “The TN content in Keluke
Lake was also…” was started as the first sentence of a new
paragraph. (Page 14, Line 6)
10. P14, line 11- Can the authors quantify “plenty”? If not, they
authors could state that the Bayin river loads relatively more sheep
and cow dung compared to other lakes – but please provide a
reference.
Response: The sentence was rewritten. (Page 14, Line 11-12)
Reviewer 3:
1. I believe that it still needs one more round of editing to fix minor
grammatical errors throughout.
Response: We carefully checked the English grammars and
syntactical structures in this whole paper and corrected by a
professional English polishing company. The revised portions
were marked in red.
2. Furthermore, I believe that the manuscript still provides rather site
specific information and the broader implications remain unclear.
I believe that the manuscript still lacks broader impacts in some
places. For example, at the end of the abstract it is noted that
nitrogen release threatens the water quality of the lake. Is there a
broader impact of this study beyond Lake Keluke? For example,
did you learn anything about nitrogen dynamics in general.
Response: The broader impact of this study was added at the end
of the Abstract and Discussion. (Page 1, Line 29-31; Page 15, Line
21-23)
3. I appreciate one of the previous reviewer’s comments about
phosphorus flux. Although this paper is not about P, it may be
useful to mention P – it is only mentioned in the last sentence of
the manuscript. You may want to mention that we know quite a
bit more about P flux from the sediment than we do about N flux
in general somewhere in the Introduction.
Response: The content and release flux of P in sediments of
Keluke Lake were added in the Introduction section. (Page 2, Line
35-40)
4. Many readers may not be familiar with what the different Classes
of lakes are (Line 31). This needs an explanation and reference
to put this in a general context that readers not familiar with this
system can understand. Furthermore, this appears to be
presented as evidence that TN is the main factor limiting water
quality – this relationship between the Class system you mention
and TN is not clear. Does the class system exclude phosphorus?
Response: The detailed explanation of the classification standard
of surface water was supplemented. (Page 2, Line 33-35)
The standard we used in the manuscript is environmental
quality standards for surface water of China (GSB3838-2002).
The standard contains 109 indexes, including 24 basic ones (P is
one of them), 5 supplementary ones and 80 particular ones for
surface water source of centralized drinking water. The standard
divides the surface water into five categories, basing on the 24
basic water quality indexes, according to the environmental
function and protection target of surface water. Zhou and Yang
(2016) analyzed the 24 basic indexes of Keluke Lake, and the
results showed that TN, COD and NH3--N were the primary
typical pollutants, and the increasing ranges of TN and NH3--N
were bigger than COD. TP was in Class II level. Our study results
on the P pollution characteristics of the sediments of Keluke Lake,
which we have added in the Instruction section, also showed that
the release risk of P in sediments was low. So, nitrogen is the main
factor that affects the water quality of Keluke Lake.

5. The statistics are not clear. For example, what are the T-Tests
used for and how?
Response: The T-Test was not used in this paper, and the statistics
were revised. (Page 6, Line 4-5)
6. The Discussion should not start with new data/information. I
suggest that you add to the end of the Introduction that 4th “task”
was to compare your results to other lakes typical of China and
other countries. You could also then introduce this table in the
Results section instead of the starting your Discussion with it.
Finally, move this discussion about comparisons with other lakes
to later in the Discussion.
Response: Comparison of nitrogen pollution characteristics in
sediments of Keluke Lake and other lakes was added as one task.
The original Table 3 was moved into the Results section and the
discussion about comparisons with other lakes was kept in the
Discussion section. (Page 8, Line 9-14; Page 9, Line 1-14; Page
13, Line 20-23; Page 14, Line 6-12)
We appreciate for Editors/Reviewers’ warm work earnestly, and hope
that the correction will meet with approval.
Once again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.
