I have read through the manuscript. Overall, this is an interesting paper with an aim to fabricate
Silk/nanosilver composite scaffolds loaded with gentamicin for treating MRSA-induced chronic
osteomyelitis. In this paper, the dissolving solvent of formic acid and silk as reducing agents for
in situ conversion AgNO3 into silver nanoparticles which were uniformly distributed in the
resulting composite scaffolds. In vitro and in vivo studies showed the good biocompatibility with
osteoblasts, superior antibacterial properties against MRSA, and effectively treat chronic
osteomyelitis. The manuscript can be considered for publication after some minor revisions.
1. The language should be checked carefully to avoid clerical errors, such as the word
“degumming” in Page 5, and the disagreement of English tenses throughout the manuscript.
2. Although the authors claimed the superior antibacterial properties against MRSA in vitro,
and effectively treatment on chronic osteomyelitis in vivo for Silk/nanosilver composite
scaffolds, the inhibition zone test could not support it, as shown in Fig.5.

In this paper SF-AgNPs composite scaffolds loaded with gentamycin are designed to treat MRSA-
induced chronic osteomyelitis. To this end, the scaffolds mainly require showing biocompatibility
3
with osteoblast, and antibacterial properties against MRSA.
This study is interesting, and the manuscript can meet the standard of the journal. I would like to
recommend it for publication if the authors can address the following points, listed on a
chronological basis rather than by importance.
Your data in figure 8, does not show a significant difference between SF+G and SF-AgNPs+G.
please provide more explanation how addition of AgNPs can improve the results.
One of the major clinical concerns is how this composite scaffolds perform over a long period of
time? how long the effect of gentamicin will last in the composite scaffold. Similarly, how long
the effect of AgNPs will last in the composite scaffold? Please discuss more the performance of
the scaffold over time.
It is claim in the following reference that the optimum pore size is more than 300 m, so since the
pore size in this study is between 130 and 460 µm, do you see any significant differences
between pore sizes? (Karageorgiou V. Porosity of 3D biomaterial scaffolds and osteogenesis.
Biomaterials. 2005) And does 300-micron pore sizes and higher give better results specially with
respect to bone formation and angiogenesis.
What would be the clinical effect of pore size?
What would be the clinical effect of inhomogeneous porous structure?
Can AgNPs be used with other natural hydrogels like gelatin and collagen as well?
What percentage of cells exhibits elongated morphology?
Does the present method have a better dispersion of AgNPs compared to the previous similar
methods?

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Professor Guy Genin):
Thank you for submitting your best work to the Royal Society. Both expert reviewers shared my
enthusiasm about your paper and suggested some minor revisions.
I note that you are correct and "degumming" is indeed an obscure but real word. For example,
according to the Oxford English Dictionary, commercial degumming machines could be
purchased all the back in the 1880s. Feel free to leave in that word if you desire.
I look forward to reading your revised manuscript.

March 30, 2019
Dear Editor,
On behalf of my co-authors, we thank you very much for giving us an
opportunity to revise our manuscript, we appreciate editor and reviewers
for their positive and constructive comments and suggestions on our
manuscript entitled “Gentamicin-loaded Silk/nanosilver composite
scaffolds for MRSA-induced chronic osteomyelitis”, which are valuable
in improving the quality of our manuscript. We have revised the
manuscript point by point according to the comments. The modification
has been highlighted in red in the paper, and a detailed point-by-point
response to the reviewers’ inputs has been provided.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Thank you and best regards.
Yours sincerely,

Response to reviewer 1
1. The language should be checked carefully to avoid clerical errors,
such as the word “degumming” in Page 5, and the disagreement of
English tenses throughout the manuscript.
Answer: Thanks for your suggestion. The English tenses in the
manuscript had been unified.
2. Although the authors claimed the superior antibacterial properties
against MRSA in vitro, and effectively treatment on chronic
osteomyelitis in vivo for Silk/nanosilver composite scaffolds, the
inhibition zone test could not support it, as shown in Fig.5.
Answer: Fig.5 showed that AgNPs had antibacterial efficiency but its
effect on bacteria was not enough. Therefore, its combination with
antibiotics is a feasible way to efficient inhibit bacterial growth, as
previous report [Bioinspired and Biomimetic AgNPs/gentamicin-
embedded Silk Fibroin Coatings for Robust Antibacterial and
Osteogenetic Applications.]. In this paper, the in vivo experiment also
confirmed that the combination of AgNPs and gentamicin was effective
in treating MRSA-induced chronic osteomyelitis.
Response to reviewer 2
1. Your data in figure 8, does not show a significant difference between
SF+G and SF-AgNPs+G. please provide more explanation how
addition of AgNPs can improve the results.
Answer: The antibiotic, such as gentamicin, was considered as the
mostly effective methods for chronic osteomyelitis. As expected, the
application of SF+G and SF-AgNPs+G all achieved satisfied results.
However, the problem of the solely use of antibiotics was the recurrence
of chronic osteomyelitis. For this, the combination of antibiotic and
AgNPs would be an alternative choice because the long-term release of
Ag+ by AgNPs that could provide a antimicrobial microenvironment,
thus restraining bacterial regrowth.
2. One of the major clinical concerns is how this composite scaffolds
perform over a long period of time? How long the effect of
gentamicin will last in the composite scaffold. Similarly, how long
the effect of AgNPs will last in the composite scaffold? Please
discuss more the performance of the scaffold over time.
Answer: The reviewer raised a very good question. The release
behavior of gentamicin and AgNPs was important. In this paper, the
gentamicin, simply absorbed into the silk scaffolds before implantation,
was released quickly and finished within 1 day, aiming to rapid kill
bacteria. In contrary, the AgNPs located in the scaffolds would release
for a long time, its complete release was closed related to silk
degradation, thus proving a long time antimicrobial microenvironment
for bone regeneration. Considered the close relationship between the
gentamicin and AgNPs release and scaffold degradation, these topics
will be studied in our future work.
3. It is claim in the following reference that the optimum pore size is
more than 300 µm, so since the pore size in this study is between
130 and 460 µm, do you see any significant differences between
pore sizes? (Karageorgiou V. Porosity of 3D biomaterial scaffolds
and osteogenesis. Biomaterials. 2005). And does 300-micron pore
sizes and higher give better results specially with respect to bone
formation and angiogenesis. What would be the clinical effect of
pore size?
Answer: The reviewer’s opinion was right. The pore size played a
critical role in regulating cell behavior and tissue growth. In this study,
most of the pore size was about 300 µm, and some smaller pore formed
in the pore wall. We prepared the silk scaffolds using the porogen of
NaCl with same partical size, forming similar porous structure, so we
didn’t study the differences between pore sizes. We believed that it was
important to study the effect of silk scaffold pore size on the bone
formation and angiogenesis, thus preparing the desired scaffold for
clinical application.
4. What would be the clinical effect of inhomogeneous porous
structure?
Answer: Thanks for your question. The porous structure, including
porosity and pore size, played an important role in bone regeneration in
vitro and in vivo. It was still unclear that the clinical effect of porous
structure, especially inhomogeneous pore, which needed more studies.
5. Can AgNPs be used with other natural hydrogels like gelatin and
collagen as well?
Answer: Yes, AgNPs had been used with gelatin and collagen
hydrogels in previous reports. “Physicochemical properties
of gelatin/silver nanoparticle antimicrobial composite films”,
“Development of gelatin hydrogel pads as antibacterial wound
dressings”.
6. What percentage of cells exhibits elongated morphology?
Answer: In our cell experiment, almost all the attached cells exhibited
elongated morphology, because the unattached cells would be removed
during the exchange of the cell medium.
7. Does the present method have a better dispersion of AgNPs
compared to the previous similar methods?
Answer: In our opinion, a similar AgNPs dispersion will be achieved
using the method of in situ reducing due to the excellent dispersibility
of silver ions.
