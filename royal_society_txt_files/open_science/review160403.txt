This paper proposes a novel hypothesis for the sexual orientation continuum based on a
competition between diversifying traits and maximising the rate of reproduction. A model based
on a simple fitness landscape is analysed, and the results reveal a rich phenomenology.
The question that this paper aims to tackle is an exceptionally challenging one. I congratulate Dr
Skinner for proposing this refreshingly simple approach. The model elegantly boils down
complexity and reveals generic insights about the distribution of sexual orientation. I believe
phrasing the sexual orientation continuum in the language of statistical physics will stimulate
new ideas and experiment designs. Even if the model presented in this paper may well turn out
to be incomplete, the approach is in and of itself extremely inspiring. As such, I strongly
recommend the publication of this paper in Royal Society Open Science.
I have several minor comments that I think the author should address:
1. The fitness of advantage of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction should be discussed
to provide a more concrete context as to why sexual reproduction is assumed in the model.
2. Fig 2b and the discussion in the main text suggest that there is a parameter regime (2<t<4)
where one should see a clear bimodal distribution of sexual orientation, and a trimodal
distribution could be seen for smaller t (in the limit of small t, I understand that p(x) can be
approximated by a Fermi function). I think the probability distribution P(\theta) for the bimodal
and trimodal regimes should be shown to make sure that this point is clear. The sexual
orientation distribution could be an important way to verify the model in animal observation
studies.

Review of “Mathematical toy model inspired by the problem of the adaptive origins of the sexual
orientation continuum”
In the manuscript, the author suggests a mechanism for the evolutionary origins of same-sex
behavior. It is based on two components: First, that sexual attraction is determined by the traits of
the other individual. Secondly, that a diversity of traits is advantageous to the population. The
author then goes on to suggest and explore a toy model inspired by these ideas.
The basic idea is interesting, and I see no reason why it couldn’t play a part in the evolutionary
mechanisms underlying the sexual-orientation continuum. The paper is very well-written, and
the mathematical model has some interesting outcomes in its own right. I therefore recommend it
for publication.
Below are a number of points that I would like the author to address, at least by mentioning them
in the manuscript.
(1) Regarding the suggested mechanism, it implies that we choose partners by traits that
have a significant contribution to the fitness of the individual. This doesn’t have to be the case: in
principle partners could be chosen by traits that would clearly mark the biological sex but have
little impact on the fitness (such as certain visual markers). Such a scenario would alleviate the
trade-off underlying the proposed mechanism. It therefore seems to me that for this mechanism
to operate there must be an evolutionary advantage to choosing partners according to such
fitness-sensitive traits.
(2) In defining the mathematical model, the author assumes that the individual’s and
desired traits, x and x_c respectively, are independent variables. This seems to be an additional,
potentially significant assumption. One could, for example, desire traits that are removed from
one’s own, changing the tension between the two terms to be balanced. (This is perhaps relates to
the previous point?)
(3) The author uses entropy to measure the diversity of traits. More commonly, the variance
of a distribution is used, as it is what enters Fisher’s Fundamental Theorem, which governs the
rate of response to a (new) gradient in the fitness. But there might also be more complicated
scenarios, so using the entropy is not unreasonable.
(4) Regarding the outcomes of the mathematical model. The author focuses on two of them:
the discreteness of sexual orientation groups, and the 1/theta distribution of sexual orientation.
Personally, I find the former to be striking: the stairs are a qualitative feature, and perhaps less
sensitive to the toy model’s details. Can the author give some more intuitive explanation to the
origin of these discontinuities? For both predictions, I wonder how sensitive they are to the more
technical details of the model (such as traits taking values between 0 and 1, the entropy as a
measure of diversity, the independence of x and x_c). Especially the 1/theta prediction might be
more sensitive.
Here are a number of more minor remarks:
- The sentence: “The distribution is determined by a single parameter t that describes the
relative value of trait diversity for the species’ fitness.” is unclear at that point in the paper. (what
is meant by “relative value of trait diversity”)
- Isn’t the parameter t equivalent to a temperature in the free-energy form in Eq. [3]? If so,
it is worth mentioning that when it is defined.
- Is Eq. [7] exact in some limit, or just a convenient fit to a sigmoid function?

ve several minor comments that I think the author should address:”
ponse:
ank the referee for this unusually kind and accurate summary.
mment 1:
e fitness of advantage of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction should be discussed
rovide a more concrete context as to why sexual reproduction is assumed in the model.”
ponse:
act, the origin of sexual reproduction (and its relative advantage over asexual reproduction) is
fficult and subtle question that remains an active topic of research. It is not within the scope
his modest paper to justify or derive the existence of sexual reproduction. I have merely
ted the model being studied to consider only sexual reproduction. This situation has been
ified in a prominent footnote added to the Introduction:
“Of course, this paper also does not attempt to analyze the relative advantages of sexual
versus asexual reproduction; only sexual reproduction is considered in the model
presented here. Questions about the origin of sex have been studied elsewhere (for
example, in Refs. [6-9]), and remain a prominent research topic.”
erences 6-9 are also newly-added.
mment 2:
g 2b and the discussion in the main text suggest that there is a parameter regime (2<t<4)
ere one should see a clear bimodal distribution of sexual orientation, and a trimodal
ribution could be seen for smaller t (in the limit of small t, I understand that p(x) can be
roximated by a Fermi function). I think the probability distribution P(\theta) for the bimodal
trimodal regimes should be shown to make sure that this point is clear. The sexual
entation distribution could be an important way to verify the model in animal observation
dies.”
ponse:
e referee is correct that in this regime the distribution is bi- or tri-modal, and that this is an
sual and surprising result of the model. Strictly speaking, however, the distribution produced
this model consists only of a discrete set of delta function peaks with zero width. These are
ewhat difficult to plot (especially since the delta function peaks have different weights). I
e instead opted to add some additional discussion about the distributions in this regime, and
write them out explicitly.
s new discussion is now added to the paragraph following equation (6):
“This splitting also has an implication for the distribution of sexual orientations,
$P(\theta)$. At $t > 4$, when the trait distribution is uniform, all individuals have
orientation $\theta = 1/2$, since there is no sexualization of traits. When $t$ is lowered
below $4$, on the other hand, there emerge two classes of orientation: $\theta = (1 \pm
c)/2$. The former class (with a majority preference for same-sex partners) comprises a
smaller proportion $(1 - c)/2$ of the population. The latter class (with a majority
preference for opposite-sex partners) comprises a larger proportion $(1 + c)/2$. In other
words, the distribution of orientation $P(\theta)$ is such that $P(\theta) = \delta(\theta -
1/2)$ at $t > 4$, while at $t$ slightly less than $4$ one has $P(\theta) = \frac{1+c}{2}
\delta\left(\theta - \frac{1-c}{2}\right) + \frac{1-c}{2}\left(\theta - \frac{1+c}{2}\right)$.
This bifurcation of the orientation distribution is depicted in Fig. 2(b).”

ponse:
ank the referee for this positive and accurate summary.
mment 1:
egarding the suggested mechanism, it implies that we choose partners by traits that have a
nificant contribution to the fitness of the individual. This doesn’t have to be the case: in
nciple partners could be chosen by traits that would clearly mark the biological sex but have
e impact on the fitness (such as certain visual markers). Such a scenario would alleviate the

perate there must be an evolutionary advantage to choosing partners according to such
ess-sensitive traits.”
ponse:
e idea that individuals choose their partners based on characteristics that are important for the
ividual’s fitness is an important assumption in this model. Indeed, as the referee notes, this
s not necessarily have to be the case, which is a large part of why the analysis presented here
sn’t go much beyond being a “toy model”.
s limitation is laid out carefully in the fifth paragraph of the Introduction:
“Instead, I focus only on a simple mathematical problem, which represents a minimal
description of a possible tradeoff between diversity of traits and sexual dichotomization.
Further, this analysis considers only the distribution of traits and preferences that
maximize the expected fitness of the population as a whole. Whether this kind of
optimum can be expected to be produced by evolution and natural selection is a delicate
question, and depends on the mechanisms by which sexual traits and sexual preferences
are (or are not) inherited [1, 2]. These questions are not considered here, and as such this
paper is best read as merely an interesting mathematical problem that is inspired by the
question of the origins of diversity in animal sexual behavior. The hope is that this
problem, and its solution, can inspire future discussion and more accurate models.”
also my response to the referee’s next comment.
mment 2:
defining the mathematical model, the author assumes that the individual’s and desired traits,
nd x_c respectively, are independent variables. This seems to be an additional, potentially
nificant assumption. One could, for example, desire traits that are removed from one’s own,
nging the tension between the two terms to be balanced. (This is perhaps relates to the
vious point?)”
ponse:
e assumption of statistical independence between x and x_c is, indeed, another important
umption of the model, unjustified by anything other than a desire for mathematical simplicity.
the referee points out, introducing correlations between traits and preferences can
damentally alter the tradeoff being considered.
ve therefore added the following sentences to the penultimate paragraph of the Discussion
tion to make this situation clear.
“If any such evidence is absent, it would suggest that the origins of same-sex sexual
behavior cannot be described as a simple competition between increased trait diversity
and increased sexual dichotomization of traits. It could also suggest that the traits desired
by a particular individual ($x_c$) are not statistically independent of the traits possessed
by the individual ($x$); such non-independence would fundamentally alter the tension
between the two terms in Eq. (3).”
mments 3 + 4:
e author uses entropy to measure the diversity of traits. More commonly, the variance of a
ribution is used, as it is what enters Fisher’s Fundamental Theorem, which governs the rate of
ponse to a (new) gradient in the fitness. But there might also be more complicated scenarios,
using the entropy is not unreasonable.
egarding the outcomes of the mathematical model. The author focuses on two of them: the
creteness of sexual orientation groups, and the 1/theta distribution of sexual orientation.
sonally, I find the former to be striking: the stairs are a qualitative feature, and perhaps less
sitive to the toy model’s details. Can the author give some more intuitive explanation to the
gin of these discontinuities? For both predictions, I wonder how sensitive they are to the more
hnical details of the model (such as traits taking values between 0 and 1, the entropy as a
asure of diversity, the independence of x and x_c). Especially the 1/theta prediction might be
re sensitive.”
ponse:
ese two related comments constitute an important discussion point raised by the referee.
eed, the model here has characterized “trait diversity” using the distribution entropy, but one
ld also have hypothesized that trait variance should be used instead. Such an assumption
uld give different (and, as it turns out, much less interesting) results.
ve added a new paragraph to the end of the Discussion section to make clear how the results
he model depend on this assumption. This paragraph also outlines how the results are
nged if one uses the variance instead of the entropy:
“Finally, it is worth emphasizing that many of the results presented here are specific to
the quantitative form of the assumed fitness function, Eq. (3). For example, one might
consider that the degree of trait diversity is better characterized using the variance
$\sigma^2 = \int_0^1 \left(x-\langle x \rangle \right)^2 p(x) dx$ rather than the entropy
$s$. (Here, $\langle x \rangle = \int_0^1 x p(x) dx$ is the average value of the trait $x$).
Substituting $\sigma^2$ for $s$ in the fitness function $f$ would then give a different
mathematical optimization problem, and thus a different trait distribution $p(x)$ for each
value of the parameter $t$. Indeed, for the specific choice $f = n(1 + t \sigma^2)$, I find
that the optimal distribution $p(x)$ assumes only one of two extremes: at all $t$ larger
than some critical value, $t_c \approx 25$, the optimal distribution is $p(x) = 1$, which
corresponds to the $t \rightarrow \infty$ limit in Fig. 2; on the other hand, at all $t < t_c$
the optimal distribution is $2 \Theta(x - 1/2)$, where $\Theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step
function, which corresponds to the $t \rightarrow 0$ limit in Fig. 2. Thus, replacing the
distribution entropy with the variance in Eq. (3) gives a significantly different
phenomenology --- one where the population consists uniformly of either bisexual
individuals ($\theta = 1/2$) or heterosexual individuals $\theta = 1$), depending on
whether $t$ is above or below a critical value.”
arding whether there is a simple intuitive explanation for the “step” features in the
ribution p(x), I am unfortunately unable to come up with one.
itional Remark #1:
re are a number of more minor remarks:
sentence: ‘The distribution is determined by a single parameter t that describes the relative
e of trait diversity for the species’ fitness.’ is unclear at that point in the paper. (what is
nt by ‘relative value of trait diversity’)”
ponse:
s sentence has been rewritten as: “The distribution is completely determined by a single
ameter $t$ that describes the relative importance of phenotypic variation for the species
ess.”
itional Remark #2:
’t the parameter t equivalent to a temperature in the free-energy form in Eq. [3]? If so, it is
th mentioning that when it is defined.”
ponse:
s is correct. Such a comment has been added shortly after Eq. (3): “In this sense, $t$ plays a
similar to that of the temperature in the Helmholtz free energy of statistical physics.”
itional Remark #3:
Eq. [7] exact in some limit, or just a convenient fit to a sigmoid function?”
ponse:
ation (7) is exact in the limit t à<U+F0E0> 0. A remark to this effect has been added to the paragraph
taining Eq. (8): “This solution minimizes Eq. (3) to within a term of order $t^3$, suggesting
Eq. (7) is exact in the limit $t \rightarrow 0$.”
