This manuscript described the gene delivery ability of polyethylenimine and polyethylene glycol
dual-functionalized nanographene oxide in eleven different cell lines, although there are many
papers published in the related scopes, this manuscript still presents some interests to readers.
However, before further consideration, following issues should be addressed:
1. To check the applicability and bio-compatablility, animal experiment should be carried out;
2. English should be carefully copyedited;
3. Reference section should be updated by citing more related papers, for example:

Dear Professor Chen,
On behalf of the Editors, I am pleased to inform you that your Manuscript RSOS-170822 entitled
"Gene delivery ability of polyethylenimine and polyethylene glycol dual-functionalized
nanographene oxide in eleven different cell lines" has been accepted for publication in Royal
Society Open Science subject to minor revision in accordance with the referee suggestions. Please
find the referees' comments at the end of this email.
The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript. You will see that one of the reviewer asks for animal experiments to be carried out.
Such experiments would go beyond the scope of this manuscript and are not required.
• Ethics statement
If your study uses humans or animals please include details of the ethical approval received,
including the name of the committee that granted approval. For human studies please also detail
whether informed consent was obtained. For field studies on animals please include details of all
permissions, licences and/or approvals granted to carry out the fieldwork.
• Data accessibility
It is a condition of publication that all supporting data are made available either as
supplementary information or preferably in a suitable permanent repository. The data
accessibility section should state where the article's supporting data can be accessed. This section
should also include details, where possible of where to access other relevant research materials
such as statistical tools, protocols, software etc can be accessed. If the data has been deposited in
an external repository this section should list the database, accession number and link to the DOI
for all data from the article that has been made publicly available. Data sets that have been
deposited in an external repository and have a DOI should also be appropriately cited in the
manuscript and included in the reference list.

supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.

Keywords: polyethylenimine, polyethylene glycol, grapheme oxide, gene delivery, transfection
efficiency
Abstract: We recently developed a polyethylenimine (PEI) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)
dual-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (GO) (PEG-nrGO-PEI, RGPP) for high-efficient
gene delivery in HepG2 and Hela cell lines. To evaluate whether the RGPP can be widely used as
a gene delivery carrier, we here evaluate the transfection efficiency of RGPP on gene plasmids and
siRNA in eleven different cell lines. Commercial polyalkyleneimine cation transfection reagent
(TR) was used as comparison. In HepG2 cells, RGPP exhibited much stronger delivery ability for
siRNA and large size of plasmids than TR. For green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid, RGPP
showed about 47.1% of transfection efficiency in primary rabbit articular chondrocytes, and about
27% of transfection efficiency in both SH-SY5Y and A549 cell lines. RGPP exhibited about 37.2%
of GFP plasmid transfection efficiency in EMT6 cells and about 26.0% of GFP plasmid
transfection efficiency in LO2 cells, but induced about 33% of cytotoxicity in both cell lines. In
4T1 and H9C2 cell lines, RGPP had less than 10% of GFP plasmid transfection efficiency.
Collectively, RGPP is a potential nano-carrier for high-efficient gene delivery, and needs to be
further optimized for different cell lines.
