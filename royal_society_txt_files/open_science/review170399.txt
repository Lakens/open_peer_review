This paper addresses the problem of potential differences in assessing a man’s leg-to-body ratio
(LBR) attractiveness on the basis of the different type of stimuli used in previous studies.
It is methodological, statistically rigorous paper that in my opinion does not bring too much new
information to this area of studies. Although it throws some light on LBR attractiveness
assessments in relationship to different types of stimuli, it does not explain lack of consistency of
the results from previous studies. The authors study only colours of stimuli and not more
valuable (probably) traits, as for instance, the fact that stimuli were based on biological data
(using LBR distribution in a studied population) in comparison to those that did not refer to real
anthropometric data. They only mention about this in the Introduction. and this differerence
could possibly allow to explain more variance in the results differences that stimuli colours.
Furthermore, there is also other confounding factor such as the spread angle between legs in
stimuli or shoulder breadth (or shoulder-to-hip ratio (SHR)). The results for white, grey and
black stimuli are almost the same. The problem with black silhouettes might be related e.g. to
very broad shoulders used in all stimuli by the authors and this makes a bit exaggerated
proportions of torso to leg length in the case of black silhouettes in which one cannot assess black
briefs borders.
The authors do not discuss the differences in the results from previous studies (in the light of
their own results) and cannot indicate that these differences have anything to do with the type of
differences (colour) in the stimuli they study.
For example, why Swami et al. (2006) who used “grey” stimuli, found preference for shorter than
average leg length in men, whereas pioneering paper by Sorokowski & Pawlowski (2008), who
used black silhouettes (according to the reviewed ms less reliable stimuli), showed that the most
attractive is LBR that is above average (similar result to the results obtained in the reviewed
paper on grey silhouettes) ? These contradictory results are opposite to the results obtained in the
reviewed ms.
It is likely that in all these studies with different stimuli it was not only colour but also some
interactions between colour and the body shape (e.g. SHR). To sum up this point, I am afraid that
this paper cannot properly explain results differences from the previous studies.
I am also not sure if all these complicated statistics (e.g. bootstrapped confidence intervals) and
figures do really bring any new important information, makes the paper longer and may
discourage non professional potential readers.

There are two places in the paper (p. 3, l. 37; p. 10, l. 21)that refer to averageness of morphological
features as signals of genetic diversity and a robust immune system. And while I am familiar
with the work on heterozygosity and immune functioning, some readers will be confused about
this use of "genetic diversity." Moreover, the possession of features that resemble the population
average is almost necessarily indicative of the possession of alleles that are widespread in the
population (and might be attractive therefore because of their demonstrated success), which runs
somewhat counter to the genetic diversity argument. It's not so much that the genetic diversity
shouldn't be mentioned as that it should be part of a broader section (or paragraph at least) on the
attractiveness of morphological averageness, particularly of facial features, but the same
theoretical rationale can apply to limb length and body proportions.
In light of what seem (to me at least) surprisingly large interaction effects of LBR x image format,
I'd like to see further discussion from the authors on what might account for its magnitude. That
is, there is reason to believe that as the stimuli become more ecologically valid, the data they
generate more precisely reflect actual human attractiveness perception, but no obvious reason
that different systematic biases from different types of stimuli (all attempting to simulate men's
bodies of different LBR) to yield a meaningful interaction. And yet, these are the data. I think this
warrants more coverage in the Discussion section.
For that matter, what accounts for the main effect of format? It might indeed be the case that most
of the studies' participants are more attracted to white men than to black men, but is this what is
reflected in the different ratings across formats -- i.e., are the color differences ecologically valid
manipulations of target race? And what then should we make of the attractiveness of gray skin?
Apart from that I have no further issues with the paper. I would simply like to see clarification of
those few points.

Reviewer 1.
Thank you for the positive comments. We have taken your suggestion and trimmed the Introduction
(by 289 words). We have also clarified the relation between our work and previous studies in the
Discussion, as described below.

Again, thank you for the positive and helpful feedback. We have trimmed the Introduction by

Reviewer: 1
This paper addresses the problem of potential differences in assessing a man’s leg-to-body ratio
(LBR) attractiveness on the basis of the different type of stimuli used in previous studies. It is
methodological, statistically rigorous paper that in my opinion does not bring too much new
information to this area of studies.
Thank you for the positive comments.
Although it throws some light on LBR attractiveness assessments in relationship to different types of
stimuli, it does not explain lack of consistency of the results from previous studies. The authors study
only colours of stimuli and not more valuable (probably) traits, as for instance, the fact that stimuli
were based on biological data (using LBR distribution in a studied population) in comparison to those
that did not refer to real anthropometric data. They only mention about this in the Introduction. and
this differerence could possibly allow to explain more variance in the results differences that stimuli
colours.
We think there might be some confusion here. We do not claim to explain the mixed results of all
previous studies. Rather, we sought to undertake a study that overcomes some of the limitations of
previous work (such as use of arbitrary stimuli and crude approaches to data-analysis), and to test
the effect of one aspect of stimulus-construction (image format).
Given that we, like other authors, find that 3D-rendered, anatomically-detailed figures produce
different results from relatively impoverished silhouettes, we make a much more modest claim:
“The main implication of our findings regarding image format, when
coupled with those of other researchers, is that previous studies of
LBR that used drawings or silhouette stimuli should be treated with
caution.”
Furthermore, there is also other confounding factor such as the spread angle between legs in stimuli
or shoulder breadth (or shoulder-to-hip ratio (SHR)). The results for white, grey and black stimuli are
almost the same. The problem with black silhouettes might be related e.g. to very broad shoulders
used in all stimuli by the authors and this makes a bit exaggerated proportions of torso to leg length
in the case of black silhouettes in which one cannot assess black briefs borders.
All of the figure formats used the same anatomical proportions, so there is no confound. However,
we agree that Silhouettes may obscure anatomical landmarks, and have noted this as follows:
“One explanation for why the optimum LBR was different for
Silhouettes is that this format obscures morphology, meaning that
people cannot readily judge leg-length relative to other anatomical
landmarks; for example, the division between torso and leg may be
harder to detect.”
The authors do not discuss the differences in the results from previous studies (in the light of their
own results) and cannot indicate that these differences have anything to do with the type of
differences (colour) in the stimuli they study. For example, why Swami et al. (2006) who used “grey”
stimuli, found preference for shorter than average leg length in men, whereas pioneering paper by
Sorokowski & Pawlowski (2008), who used black silhouettes (according to the reviewed ms less
reliable stimuli), showed that the most attractive is LBR that is above average (similar result to the
results obtained in the reviewed paper on grey silhouettes) ? These contradictory results are opposite
to the results obtained in the reviewed ms.
Again, our argument is not that we can explain the diverse results of many different papers; it’s
simply that we should focus on results obtained using well-constructed stimuli that are based on
population statistics and 3D-rendered to be reasonably realistic.
Correspondingly, in the Discussion we focus on comparing our results with those other studies that
have used anatomically-detailed stimuli. We have expanded and clarified this material, as follows:
“Few previous studies of LBR preference have used anatomically-
detailed figures. The study most similar to our own is that by Kiire
[34], who used 3D-rendered images and found an optimum very close to
the baseline value of 0.457 (the average for Japanese people in their
20s, and somewhat lower than the baseline used in the current
studies). This is slightly different from our finding that, for
heterosexual US women, the optimally-attractive LBR is about half a
standard deviation above the population mean. Given that 0.5 SD
represents a small absolute departure from baseline, the discrepancy
between our results and those of Kiire may not be meaningful.
Alternatively, it could reflect cross-cultural variation: we sampled
heterosexual females from the public in the United States whereas
Kiire [34] used a mixture of male and female Japanese undergraduates;
there may be geographic variation in limb-length preferences
reflecting local environmental factors, but this has not yet been
investigated with high-quality, detailed figures [35,37,38]. The
second study used 3D-figurines to investigate the developmental
trajectory of LBR preference among Polish children and teenagers,
using a small set of widely-spaced stimuli (-15%, -7.5%, 0%, +7.5%,
and +15% above baseline)[36]. The authors report little preference
among younger participants, but state that for those aged 15-20 the
most attractive LBR was 7.5% above the approximate population average
– a result which is directionally the same as ours but more extreme,
although the small number of tested LBRs and rather limited
information about the data analysis and relation between the tested
LBRs and population distribution makes direct comparison with our
work difficult. One additional study studied female LBRs using 3D-
rendered images and reported a quadratic trend, such that extreme
values were less attractive, but did not attempt to identify the peak
of the judgment function [40].”
It is likely that in all these studies with different stimuli it was not only colour but also some
interactions between colour and the body shape (e.g. SHR). To sum up this point, I am afraid that this
paper cannot properly explain results differences from the previous studies.
See response to above comments.
I am also not sure if all these complicated statistics (e.g. bootstrapped confidence intervals) and
figures do really bring any new important information, makes the paper longer and may discourage
non professional potential readers.
We believe that our approach offers an improvement over previous work, and have retained it.
Reviewer: 2
There are two places in the paper (p. 3, l. 37; p. 10, l. 21)that refer to averageness of morphological
features as signals of genetic diversity and a robust immune system. And while I am familiar with the
work on heterozygosity and immune functioning, some readers will be confused about this use of
"genetic diversity." Moreover, the possession of features that resemble the population average is
almost necessarily indicative of the possession of alleles that are widespread in the population (and
might be attractive therefore because of their demonstrated success), which runs somewhat counter
to the genetic diversity argument. It's not so much that the genetic diversity shouldn't be mentioned
as that it should be part of a broader section (or paragraph at least) on the attractiveness of
morphological averageness, particularly of facial features, but the same theoretical rationale can
apply to limb length and body proportions.
As part of the Editor’s suggestion that we trim the introduction, we have removed that material. We
now touch on it briefly in the Discussion, where we give a clearer explanation than before – as
follows:
“very long limbs may indicate harmful genetic conditions [30] and,
more generally, averageness is thought to signal genetic diversity
and immunocompetence [21]. For example, human males with more
average-looking faces have greater heterozygosity in the major
histocompatibility complex [54], corresponding to immunity against a
wider range of pathogens [55].”
In light of what seem (to me at least) surprisingly large interaction effects of LBR x image format, I'd
like to see further discussion from the authors on what might account for its magnitude. That is,
there is reason to believe that as the stimuli become more ecologically valid, the data they generate
more precisely reflect actual human attractiveness perception, but no obvious reason that different
systematic biases from different types of stimuli (all attempting to simulate men's bodies of different
LBR) to yield a meaningful interaction. And yet, these are the data. I think this warrants more
coverage in the Discussion section.
We are wary about offering a definite explanation without more data, but we offer the following
speculation in the revised Discussion:
“One explanation for why the optimum LBR was different for
Silhouettes is that this format obscures morphology, meaning that
people cannot readily judge leg-length relative to other anatomical
landmarks; for example, the division between torso and leg may be
harder to detect. This would be consistent with our finding that
people were also less sensitive to changes in LBR for the Silhouette
figures, but remains a speculative suggestion.”
For that matter, what accounts for the main effect of format? It might indeed be the case that most
of the studies' participants are more attracted to white men than to black men, but is this what is
reflected in the different ratings across formats -- i.e., are the color differences ecologically valid
manipulations of target race? And what then should we make of the attractiveness of gray skin?
We don’t have a good explanation, unfortunately, but we now briefly touch on this in the Discussion,
as follows:
“we can only speculate as to why there was an overall effect of
figure format on attractiveness judgments: the relatively low
attractiveness of Black figures might be attributed to an own-race
preference among our predominantly white participants, but this
wouldn’t explain why Silver figures were judged most attractive
overall in both studies.”
Apart from that I have no further issues with the paper. I would simply like to see clarification of
those few points.
Thank you for the positive and helpful suggestions.
