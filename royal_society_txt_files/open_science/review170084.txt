The impact of induced anxiety on affective response inhibition
Aylward et al., Royal Society Open
Better understanding the balance of adaptive and maladaptive aspects of anxiety can indeed be
crucial for knowing how to more effectively reduce anxiety in those suffer from too much. This
study therefore offers the potential to add additional important information in a less constricted
setting than usual lab experiences.
In principle, null effects can provide useful additions to scientific knowledge. In the case of this
study, however, I believe that there are several methodological confounds which severely limit
interpretation of the results.
The first such limitation is the choice of the affective stimuli for the go/no-go task. I applaud the
effort to add an affective component to a standard cognitive task. However, in this case I believe
the authors are sabotaging their ability to find what they are looking for. It is well documented
that fearful faces increase attentional bias and are likely processed processed more quickly than
other emotions (see among many examples, Mogg et al. 2007 who found more attentional bias
towards threatening faces; Ladoceur et al, 2009 who “ suggest that anxious individuals,
particularly younger ones, exhibit difficulty resisting interference from threat-related stimuli
when greater attentional resources are being recruited”). Thus, the tasks is looking for
participants on the one hand to inhibit a response, except this response has a strong evolutionary
basis for coming faster and automatically. This contrast between expected slowing on the task but
expected speeding up for the specific stimuli is likely to lead to...no effect, which is what was
found.
Another possible confound--perhaps in contradiction to the previous point but I can’t find the
data to tell--is a ceiling effect. How accurate were participants at the no-go trials? I can’t find that
in the paper. If everyone turned out to be good at that task then again the effect would be
diminished, but I don’t see those data presented.
Another possibility to explain the null effect, that the authors mention only briefly, is that the
duration of the stimulus presentation (250ms) may have been shorter than required to processes
the emotion adequately. The authors note that longer presentations are usually necessary but
don’t explain why this was not done in this study. Perhaps the stimuli didn’t affect performance
simply because they weren’t able to be processed because they appeared for such a short
duration.
Another set of possibilities is the environment. While the authors note the benefit of a more
naturalistic setting, I wonder if being in such a noisy environment with people coming and going
constantly, and able to watch you doing the experiment, was simply too distracting and took
significant attention away from the task. The fact that many were likely drinking alcohol is
experimentally disturbing, as this is a known relaxant and likely blunted affective response in
many participants; since the alcohol monitor likely didn’t work apparently, it’s really hard to tell
what effect the alcohol had but is another instance where the design actively worked against the
hypothesized effects.

The report contains a single study investigating systematic effects of fearful vs. happy faces on
go/no-go performance in trial blocks with and without a threat of shock. The experiment
replicated a previous finding that behavioural performance is generally slowed down by a threat
of shock. However, the study did not find an improved inhibition of responses to affectively
congruent stimuli as observed in previous research.
I generally liked reading this paper and the experiment. However, I have my doubts what
conclusions can be derived from the author’s research. My opinion is that the presented study
does not clarify whether a facilitation of response inhibition by fearful stimuli is existent, or
boundary conditions of the effect under research. Accordingly, I cannot recommend publication
in its present form. Having said this, I also want to encourage authors to continue their research
and to conduct a second, methodologically improved study. Two properly conducted studies
may bear the potential for a strong publication if their results point in the same directions.
Here some comments for an improvement:
-- According to my reading, the study was designed to replicate research using a SART-paradigm
published by Robinson et al in the year 2013 (Frontiers in Neuroscience). Accordingly, this
original research and deviations from the original study should be described in great detail. (The
present discussion lacks details reg stimuli, timing parameters, proportion of go/nogo trials, etc.)
-- Choice of sample size (n = 47) is justified with power analyses. First, computation of an effect
size is not an a priori power analysis (power = 1-beta error). Second, statistical power was
high/sufficient with P = 0.96 (probability, not percentage) according to posteriori analyses.
Acceptance of a “null hypothesis” on the basis of sufficient observed power is fundamentally
flawed (for an explanation see: Hoenig & Heisey, The abuse of power: The pervasive fallacy of
power calculations for data analysis, The American Statistician, 55, 2001). The Bayesian approach
used by the authors is much better suited for this research purpose which should be highlighted.
-- Authors do not report descriptive statistics (RT; accurarcy). I am particularly interested in the
hit/false alarm rates given that the proportion/number of no-go trials was very low (5 out of 52
trials). Could a low variance in the false alarm rate explain the null-finding?
-- The experiment/setting was not optimized in several ways. The experiment was done at a
noisy/crowded public place. It is possible that some of the participants were drunk (increasing
data noise). Blocks with/without shocks differed also in the background colour (a red
background color may have affected response performance/avoidance motivation independent
4
of a shock threat; see Elliot, Maier, Moller, Friedman, & Meinhardt, 2007, JEP:G). As discussed by
the authors, presentation times and RT levels were different in the original. As stated above, I
recommend repeating the experiment with optimization of those task procedures.

Overall, I think the manuscript has potential to make a nice contribution to the literature. I think
the authors have adequately dealt with the prior review by introducing the follow up study. I
have a few points below.
1. Why didn’t the authors use neutral faces as a control against the happy/fearful faces?
2. For the STAI analyses can you report the highest r and p values. I would like to see the
correlational graphs. Alternatively, it may be worth including the STAI measure in an ANCOVA
or multilevel model and report these data? It will reduce the number of correlational tests
required and will increase the power of this individual difference analysis.
7
3. Page 8 – The authors mention using sad faces. Do they mean fearful? As there is no other
mention of sad faces throughout the paper.
4. In the figures, I don’t understand what the bar colours represent. I couldn’t see it in the
description. I assume it is related to the context shock or no shock. In addition, for the figure I
wasn’t sure what you meant by targets, go, no-go or both. Can you be more explicit?
5. The STAI measure is not particularly specific with regards to what makes a person
anxious. In the context of this experiment perhaps another measure of self-report such as social
anxiety may have been more appropriate and would have shown specificity over STAI, given
that social stimuli such as faces were used and it took place under the observation of others.
Could you add this as a point in your discussion?
6. On page 26, in the discussion could you expand this point on the spill over of threat
related behaviour in the safe condition. There is a large body of work on conditioning and threat
generalization in anxiety (Greenberg et al, 2013; Lissek et al, 2013). Recently, such generalization
behaviour has been specifically linked to self-reported intolerance of uncertainty, over STAI
(Morriss, Christakou & van Reekum, 2015; Morriss, Christakou & van Reekum, 2016; Morriss,
Henne & van Reekum, 2016). Could there be some uncertainty or distrust regarding potential
shock in the safe condition? Fearful faces could prime such generalization behaviour.

This is a re-submission of sorts of an earlier (rejected) manuscript, that includes new data with
new methods and new samples. The "Study 2" is in much better shape and could be reviewed on
its own. However I find the two fundamental flaws in Study 1: the noisy, alcohol-laden
environment and the two-short stimulus presentation, to be unmanageable. There is no way to
control for who may have been drinking, and no way to fix a fundamental design flaw in the first
study. I would be happy to look at the study with the new data but the old data are not worth
reviewing, in my opinion.

This submission explores the effect of threat of shock on performance during an affective version
of the sustained attention to response task. They found that threat increased reaction time during
all conditions. Additionally, they found that for longer stimulus durations, subjects were faster at
responding to fearful faces.
This is a substantially revised version of a previously submitted manuscript, with there are
accompanying reviews and the authors' responses to those reviews. After carefully reading both
the manuscript and the reviews, it is my opinion that the authors have sufficiently addressed the
concerns of the original reviewers, and that the manuscript represents a substantial contribution
to the field. I have only minor suggestions (listed below) that might improve the manuscript.
Minor suggestions:
1) In this work, threat of shock increases reaction time, while fear (as a stimulus attribute) reduces
reaction time. Given that these two manipulations share many affective characteristics, it would
be interesting to know why they should have opposite effects on reaction time. The authors might
speculate on this in the discussion, and perhaps propose future studies to address this distinction.
9
2) It is interesting that the results from this study do not replicate their previous facilitation of no-
go accuracy as a function of threat. The authors provide a convincing explanation for this
discrepancy in the discussion: "Perhaps the presence of emotional stimuli, especially fearful faces,
was enough to focus attention on the task during the safe conditions (i.e. prevent the engagement
of a habitual go response) too and hence reduce the threat safe differential. " However, it would
be interesting to see this explicitly tested. I realize that this is out of the scope of the current work,
but it is something that would be of interest to the field.
3) The authors mention in the discussion: "Here, we replicate the effect of condition on reaction
time, with threat of shock slowing down responses, but now also observe an effect of valence on
reaction time, with participants faster to respond to fearful faces. This aligns with research
demonstrating a bias towards fearful faces (10,14,26) under threat of shock..." To me the second
statement of this quote implies a condition by valence interaction, which the authors do not find.
I would recommend removing or changing this statement in the revised version of the
manuscript.

concerns of the original reviewers, and that the manuscript represents a substantial contribution
to the field. I have only minor suggestions (listed below) that might improve the manuscript.
Minor suggestions:
1) In this work, threat of shock increases reaction time, while fear (as a stimulus attribute) reduces
reaction time. Given that these two manipulations share many affective characteristics, it would
be interesting to know why they should have opposite effects on reaction time. The authors might
speculate on this in the discussion, and perhaps propose future studies to address this distinction.
2) It is interesting that the results from this study do not replicate their previous facilitation of no-
go accuracy as a function of threat. The authors provide a convincing explanation for this
discrepancy in the discussion: "Perhaps the presence of emotional stimuli, especially fearful faces,
13
was enough to focus attention on the task during the safe conditions (i.e. prevent the engagement
of a habitual go response) too and hence reduce the threat safe differential. " However, it would
be interesting to see this explicitly tested. I realize that this is out of the scope of the current work,
but it is something that would be of interest to the field.
3) The authors mention in the discussion: "Here, we replicate the effect of condition on reaction
time, with threat of shock slowing down responses, but now also observe an effect of valence on
reaction time, with participants faster to respond to fearful faces. This aligns with research
demonstrating a bias towards fearful faces (10,14,26) under threat of shock..." To me the second
statement of this quote implies a condition by valence interaction, which the authors do not find.
I would recommend removing or changing this statement in the revised version of the
manuscript.

Appendix A
Dear Matthew Allinson,
We hope you will consider our paper entitled “The impact of induced anxiety on affective
response inhibition” for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
This paper contains new, unpublished data and analyses. However, it should be noted that a
subset of this data was previously submitted for publication in Royal Society Open Science
(RSOS-150641). In reviewing that portion of the data, the reviewers raised a number of
helpful points and suggestions, which inspired two subsequent additional experiments that
form the basis of this new paper. This paper is so substantially changed that we believe it
should be considered an entirely new submission.
We hope that you will consider this new paper suitable for publication in Royal Society Open
Science.
Yours sincerely,
Jessica Aylward

1. The first such limitation is the choice of the affective stimuli for the go/no-go
task. I applaud the effort to add an affective component to a standard cognitive
task. However, in this case I believe the authors are sabotaging their ability to
find what they are looking for. It is well documented that fearful faces increase
attentional bias and are likely processed more quickly than other emotions (see
among many examples, Mogg et al. 2007 who found more attentional bias
towards threatening faces; Ladoceur et al, 2009 who “ suggest that anxious
individuals, particularly younger ones, exhibit difficulty resisting interference
from threat-related stimuli when greater attentional resources are being
recruited”). Thus, the tasks is looking for participants on the one hand to inhibit
a response, except this response has a strong evolutionary basis for coming faster
and automatically. This contrast between expected slowing on the task but
expected speeding up for the specific stimuli is likely to lead to...no effect, which
is what was found.
This is an interesting point,which we now cover in the discussion:
“A final explanation is that there might be a conflict between a prepotent bias to respond quickly to
emotional stimuli which takes precedent over task demands for inhibitory control and, as such,
removes the ability for the threatening context to improve inhibition.”
2. Another possible confound--perhaps in contradiction to the previous point but I
can’t find the data to tell--is a ceiling effect. How accurate were participants at
the no-go trials? I can’t find that in the paper. If everyone turned out to be good
at that task then again the effect would be diminished, but I don’t see those data
presented.
We have included the accuracy and reaction time data in new tables within the paper
(Table 1 and Table 2).Participants were significantly less accurate at the first event,
perhaps because the duration of stimulus presentation was shorter than required to
adequately process the emotion. At the second event in which the stimulus
presentations were a lot longer, accuracy for all trial types is significantly improved
(ps < 0.05).
3. Another possibility to explain the null effect, that the authors mention only
briefly, is that the duration of the stimulus presentation (250ms) may have been
shorter than required to processes the emotion adequately. The authors note that
longer presentations are usually necessary but don’t explain why this was not
done in this study. Perhaps the stimuli didn’t affect performance simply because
they weren’t able to be processed because they appeared for such a short
duration.
This is a good point, which we now address in the new studies with longer stimulus
duration. Regarding why the duration was so short, many trials are required in order
to set up a prepotent response. In order to make the task as accessible as possible at a
science engagement event (by having a short task duration), whilst at the same time
setting up a prepotent response, we kept the same length of stimulus presentation as in
the original, non-affective SART (Robinson, Krimsky, et al., 2013), and reduced the
number of blocks. We now include this in the Methods (Study 1) section (p.6):
“Face stimuli were presented for 250ms, followed by an interstimulus interval of 750ms,
before presentation of the next stimulus (See Figure 1A). The stimulus presentation durations
remained the same as in the original design (Robinson, Krimsky, et al., 2013) and there were
a smaller number of blocks, in order to reduce task length.”
However, in response to this comment, in Study 2, we increased the stimulus
presentation duration to 750ms. Method (Study 2) (p.7):
“In contrast to study one, face stimuli were presented for 750ms, whilst the interstimulus
interval remained the same at 750ms (See Figure 1B). The stimulus presentations were longer
in this task to ensure that the duration was sufficient to allow for the processing of the
emotion. As in Study 1, the number of blocks were fewer than in the original design
(Robinson et al., 2013b) in order to reduce total task duration.”
Therefore the reviewer was likely correct that the results we saw were due to the
length of stimulus presentation. Which we now also discuss in the Conclusion (p.15):
“…during Study 2 the stimulus presentation times were increased to 750ms. Here, we replicate
the effect of condition on reaction time, with threat of shock slowing down responses, but now
also observe an effect of valence on reaction time, with participants faster to respond to fearful
faces. This aligns with research demonstrating a bias towards fearful faces (Wilson &
MacLeod, 2003; Robinson, et al., 2012, Robinson, et al., 2011) under threat of shock and
suggests that for valence effects to emerge, stimulus presentations need to be longer.”
4. Another set of possibilities is the environment. While the authors note the benefit
of a more naturalistic setting, I wonder if being in such a noisy environment with
people coming and going constantly, and able to watch you doing the experiment,
was simply too distracting and took significant attention away from the task.
We refer the reviewer to the data we collected at the Wellcome Trust. Data was
collected in a similar same setting (i.e. people were free to wander and watch the
task) and we saw an effect of threat on reaction time and a main effect of valence.
Therefore the reviewer was likely correct that the results we saw at the first event
were due to the length of stimulus presentation. This slowing down of responses under
threat replicates previous studies (Aylward & Robinson, 2016) and, as the reviewer
points out, is in line with other studies that show fearful faces are processed more
quickly other emotions (Mogg et al 2007). We appreciate that the testing environment
was significantly more distracting that a typical laboratory environment, but that we
still see these effects is very encouraging. However, we agree with the reviewer that
these are important and so now provide a paragraph discussing these as limitations:
Conclusion (p.17-18):
“It is also worth highlighting the somewhat unique data collection environments which may
have impacted on the data. Data was collected in very busy rooms with event attendees free to
wander around and watch the testing. After optimisation of the task in Study 2, we observed a
main effect of valence, which suggests that participants were concentrating on the task.
However, attention on the task might plausibly be less than it would have been in a controlled
laboratory setting. This could be particularly relevant as individual differences in attentional
control mechanisms interact with performance across threat and safe conditions (Grillon,
Robinson, Mathur, & Ernst, 2016) and prominent theories of anxiety (Derakshan & Eysenck,
2009; Eysenck, Derakshan, Santos, & Calvo, 2007). However, the lack of a study effect in the
pooled data counteracts this hypothesis, as there was no differential performance in the lab
collected data. It is also worth noting that alcohol was widely available at the first event. In
order to address this potential confound and to also look at potential interactions between
anxiety level, blood alcohol concentration and task performance, blood alcohol measurements
were recorded. Whilst blood alcohol concentration did not correlate with any performance
measure (p > 0.05) it should be noted that the breathalyser measures may have been unreliable.
Since alcohol reduces anxiety and the key to investigating this affective bias in our task is
comparison of performance across safe and threat (stress-inducing) conditions, the presence of
unaccounted for alcohol-driven variance might explain our null finding on the first event.
Nonetheless, unlike traditional controlled laboratory settings, these results can be considered a
naturalistic representation of performance during a social event and demonstrate collecting data
during public engagement events is possible. Indeed, we were especially keen to publish this
data as part of this continuing engagement such that participants will eventually be able to track
their involvement all the way to this paper.”
5. The fact that many were likely drinking alcohol is experimentally disturbing, as
this is a known relaxant and likely blunted affective response in many
participants; since the alcohol monitor likely didn’t work apparently, it’s really
hard to tell what effect the alcohol had but is another instance where the design
actively worked against the hypothesized effects.
The data we collected from the second event can address this point. At this event,
during which the stimulus presentations were longer and participants were not
drinking alcohol), we again see that threat of shock slows down responses. In the
second experiment we also observe a main effect of valence. This suggests the
hypothesised effects may not have been observed in the first study due to limitations of
the design rather than the environment.
Reviewer 2.
My opinion is that the presented study does not clarify whether a facilitation of
response inhibition by fearful stimuli is existent, or boundary conditions of the
effect under research. Two properly conducted studies may bear the potential
for a strong publication if their results point in the same directions. Here some
comments for an improvement:
According to my reading, the study was designed to replicate research using a
SART-paradigm published by Robinson et al in the year 2013 (Frontiers in
Neuroscience). Accordingly, this original research and deviations from the
original study should be described in great detail. (The present discussion lacks
details reg stimuli, timing parameters, proportion of go/nogo trials, etc.)
We have made changes to the manuscript to describe deviations from the original
design. General Methods, (p. 5):
“In keeping with the original study (Robinson, Krimsky, et al., 2013), in order to set up a pre-
potent response, the ‘go’ to ‘no-go’ stimuli ratio was ~ 10:1.”
Methods (Study 1),(p. 6):
“The stimulus presentation durations remained the same as in the original design (Robinson,
Krimsky, et al., 2013) and there were a smaller number of blocks, in order to reduce task
length..”
Methods (Study 2),(p. 7):
“In contrast to study one, face stimuli were presented for 750ms, whilst the interstimulus
interval remained the same at 750ms (See Figure 1B). The stimulus presentations were longer
in this task to ensure that the duration was sufficient to allow for the processing of the
emotion. As in Study 1, the number of blocks were fewer than in the original design
(Robinson, Krimsky, et al., 2013) in order to reduce total task duration.”
6. Choice of sample size (n = 47) is justified with power analyses. First, computation
of an effect size is not an a priori power analysis (power = 1-beta error). Second,
statistical power was high/sufficient with P = 0.96 (probability, not percentage)
according to posteriori analyses. Acceptance of a “null hypothesis” on the basis
of sufficient observed power is fundamentally flawed (for an explanation see:
Hoenig & Heisey, The abuse of power: The pervasive fallacy of power
calculations for data analysis, The American Statistician, 55, 2001). The Bayesian
approach used by the authors is much better suited for this research purpose
which should be highlighted.
We have changed the wording of our power analysis which now justifies our methods
(p. 5):
“An a priori power analysis was run in G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007).
The power analysis was based on previous results of the SART (Robinson, Krimsky, et al.,
2013) that gave an effect size of 0.56 for the effect of threat of shock on response accuracy to
“no-go” distractor stimuli. A power calculation determined that we needed 44 participants with
95% power (with alpha 0.05, two tailed) to detect an effect size of 0.56. Due the popularity
of the events, we collected data from an extra 3 and 12 participants at each event.”
We have explained and highlighted the suitability of the Bayesian approach as follows
(Methods p.8):
The Bayesian approach considers how likely the data if the alternative hypothesis is true
versus if the null hypothesis is true, and is a very suitable approach for this research.
7. Authors do not report descriptive statistics (RT; accuracy). I am particularly
interested in the hit/false alarm rates given that the proportion/number of no-go
trials was very low (5 out of 52 trials). Could a low variance in the false alarm
rate explain the null-finding?
We now include the accuracy and RT data in the paper (Table 1 and Table 2).
Participants were significantly less accurate at the first event, perhaps because the
duration of stimulus presentation is shorter than required to adequately process the
emotion. At the second event in which the stimulus presentations were a lot longer,
accuracy for all trial types is significantly improved (ps < 0.05).
8. The experiment/setting was not optimized in several ways. The experiment was
done at a noisy/crowded public place. It is possible that some of the participants
were drunk (increasing data noise).
We refer the reviewer to the results from the second event, at the Wellcome
Collection. Data was collected in a similar setting (i.e. people were free to wander
and watch the task) and again we observed an effect of threat on reaction time and
now a main effect of valence. This slowing down of responses under threat replicates
previous studies (Aylward & Robinson, 2016) and, as the reviewer points out, is in
line with other studies that show fearful faces are processed more quickly other
emotions (Mogg et al 2007). We appreciate that the testing environment was
significantly more distracting that a typical laboratory environment, but that we still
see these effects is very encouraging. At this second event, alcohol was not permitted
and so there should be no increase in alcohol related data noise at this event. We
have discussed these limitations in the conclusion (p.17 – 18):
“It is also worth highlighting the somewhat unique data collection environments which may
have impacted on the data. Data was collected in very busy rooms with event attendees free to
wander around and watch the testing. After optimisation of the task in Study 2, we observed a
main effect of valence, which suggests that participants were concentrating on the task.
However, attention on the task might plausibly be less than it would have been in a controlled
laboratory setting. This could be particularly relevant as individual differences in attentional
control mechanisms interact with performance across threat and safe conditions (Grillon,
Robinson, Mathur, & Ernst, 2016) and prominent theories of anxiety (Derakshan & Eysenck,
2009; Eysenck, Derakshan, Santos, & Calvo, 2007). However, the lack of a study effect in the
pooled data counteracts this hypothesis, as there was no differential performance in the lab
collected data. It is also worth noting that alcohol was widely available at the first event. In
order to address this potential confound and to also look at potential interactions between
anxiety level, blood alcohol concentration and task performance, blood alcohol measurements
were recorded. Whilst blood alcohol concentration did not correlate with any performance
measure (p > 0.05) it should be noted that the breathalyser measures may have been unreliable.
Since alcohol reduces anxiety and the key to investigating this affective bias in our task is
comparison of performance across safe and threat (stress-inducing) conditions, the presence of
unaccounted for alcohol-driven variance might explain our null finding on the first event.
Nonetheless, unlike traditional controlled laboratory settings, these results can be considered a
naturalistic representation of performance during a social event and demonstrate collecting data
during public engagement events is possible. Indeed, we were especially keen to publish this
data as part of this continuing engagement such that participants will eventually be able to track
their involvement all the way to this paper.”
9. Blocks with/without shocks differed also in the background colour (a red
background color may have affected response performance/avoidance
motivation independent of a shock threat; see Elliot, Maier, Moller, Friedman, &
Meinhardt, 2007, JEP:G).
This is a good point and we now include results from a follow up sample to address this
comments. We tested 18 participants at UCL who completed exactly the same task as
at the Wellcome Trust event, but the background colour was counterbalanced. When in
a safe condition the background was red, and when in a threat condition the
background was blue. By pooling data, we demonstrate that the effect of threat remains,
with participants slower to respond under threat, but crucially that there is no
significant interaction between study and condition. We can therefore show that
background colour is not driving the effect. We also cite a number of other studies
demonstrating no effect of background colour on threat of shock paradigms.
Results: (p. 13):
“As all subjects in study 2 completed the task with the same background colours, we collected
a small set of data in the laboratory with reversed colours to determine whether effects were
driven by colour rather than condition. Pooling this data with that collected the study 2, the
effect of threat on reaction time remained, with participants slower to respond under threat of
shock (F(1,71) = 6.40, p = 0.014, <U+0001D702><U+0001D45D>2 = 0.083; threat M = 383.87ms, SD = 63.35ms, safe M =
369.10ms, SD = 73.91ms). Crucially, however, there was no significant interaction between
colour and condition (F(1,71) = 0.12, p = 0.731, <U+0001D702><U+0001D45D>2 = 0.002), so background colour is unlikely
to be driving the effect of threat of shock.”
Discussion (p.16)
“We also highlight that the effect of threat of shock on reaction time remained when pooling
results from the second and third studies, and crucially background colour did not interact
with condition. This indicates that the effect of shock we see is not driven by the background
colour and is consistent with prior research that has also demonstrated no influence of
background colour on the effects of threat of shock (Grillon, Ameli, Merikangas, Woods, &
Davis, 1993; Christian Grillon, Baas, Cornwell, & Johnson, 2006)”
10. As discussed by the authors, presentation times and RT levels were different in
the original. As stated above, I recommend repeating the experiment with
optimization of those task procedures.
We have now repeated the experiment modified according to the reviewer’s
comments. We thank the reviewer for these helpful suggestions.

Dear Andrew Dunn,
Thank you for considering our manuscript RSOS-170084 entitled "The impact of induced
anxiety on affective response inhibition”. We have taken into consideration the reviewers’
helpful points and suggestions when revising the manuscript. The changes are highlighted

to the manuscript are in normal type). We have also highlighted the corresponding parts of
the main manuscript.
We thank you and the reviewers for your careful consideration of our manuscript and hope that
you now consider it ready for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Yours sincerely,
Jessica Aylward & Oliver Robinson
Reviewer 1.
1. Why didn’t the authors use neutral faces as a control against the
happy/fearful faces?
We chose to use happy and fearful faces only for a few reasons:
1) These stimuli were used in a previous study and we wished to make the studies
comparable (Robinson, Letkiewicz, Overstreet, Ernst, & Grillon, 2011).
2) Neutral faces are potentially less arousing and salient than fearful faces, so
effects could plausibly be explained by arousal. We wanted to avoid this by
having the faces differ on valence, but minimise arousal/salience difference.
3) Neutral faces can be perceived as negative (Leppänen, Milders, Bell, Terriere,
& Hietanen, 2004; Yoon & Zinbarg, 2008).
We now include this explanation in the methods (ps.5 -6):
“We chose to use only happy and fearful faces in order to keep our study comparable with
previous research (Robinson et al., 2011). In addition, the exclusion of neutral faces, which are
potentially less arousing or salient than fearful and happy faces, increases the possibility that
any resulting effects could be explained by valence. Moreover there is large variation in the
perception of face stimuli, which could manifest in neutral face stimuli being perceived as
negative (Leppänen et al., 2004; Yoon & Zinbarg, 2008).”
2. For the STAI analyses can you report the highest r and p values. I would
like to see the correlational graphs. Alternatively, it may be worth including the
STAI measure in an ANCOVA or multilevel model and report these data? It will
reduce the number of correlational tests required and will increase the power of
this individual difference analysis.
We have now included the highest r and p values in the manuscript (p.12):
“The correlation between trait anxiety and threat minus safe reaction time to fearful targets had
the highest correlation in both study 1 and 2 (r = 0.256, p = 0.188, r = 0.233, p = 0.087). Please
see the supplementary material for correlational graphs (S1and S2).”
For ease, please see the graphs copied below:
Figure S1: Threat minus safe reaction time and accuracy vs trait anxiety scores in Study 1 (r
and p values reported in legend).
Figure S2: Threat minus safe reaction time and accuracy vs trait anxiety scores Study 2 (r and
p values reported in legend).
3. Page 8 – The authors mention using sad faces. Do they mean fearful? As
there is no other mention of sad faces throughout the paper.
We apologise - this is a typo on our part and the mention of a sad face on Page 8 has
been changed to ‘fearful’.
4. In the figures, I don’t understand what the bar colours represent. I couldn’t
see it in the description. I assume it is related to the context shock or no shock. In
addition, for the figure I wasn’t sure what you meant by targets, go, no-go or
both. Can you be more explicit?
The reviewer is correct that the colours relate to the safe and threat condition. To
make this more obvious we have added a legend to Figures 2 and 3. We have also
made more explicit what we mean by ‘target’ stimuli in the Figure captions. We have
included these changes below:
“Figure 1. Participants were instructed to press the space bar as quickly as possible for target,
‘go’ stimuli and withhold responses to infrequent distractor, ‘no-go’ stimuli (‘go’ and ‘no-go’
stimuli valence was counterbalanced).”
Figure 2. Study 1. Participants were significantly slower to respond to targets (‘go’ stimuli)
when under threat of shock (p < 0.001). Error bars represent one SEM.
Figure 3. Study 2: Participants were significantly slower to respond to targets (‘go’ stimuli)
when under threat of shock (p = 0.006) and faster to respond to fearful stimuli overall (p =
0.004). Error bars represent one SEM.
5. The STAI measure is not particularly specific with regards to what makes a
person anxious. In the context of this experiment perhaps another measure of
self-report such as social anxiety may have been more appropriate and would
have shown specificity over STAI, given that social stimuli such as faces were
used and it took place under the observation of others. Could you add this as a
point in your discussion?
This is an interesting point, and we now add comment in the discussion (p17):
“It should be noted that the STAI measure we used to determine dispositional anxiety may
not be the best measure to assess anxiety related to social stimuli such as faces. Future work
may seek to determine individual differences in social anxiety.”
6. On page 26, in the discussion could you expand this point on the spill over of threat
related behaviour in the safe condition. There is a large body of work on conditioning
and threat generalization in anxiety (Greenberg et al, 2013; Lissek et al, 2013).
Recently, such generalization behaviour has been specifically linked to self-reported
intolerance of uncertainty, over STAI (Morriss, Christakou & van Reekum, 2015;
Morriss, Christakou & van Reekum, 2016; Morriss, Henne & van Reekum, 2016).

Uncertainty Predicts Threat Generalization. PLOSone. 2016
This is an interesting point and we have read the studies provided by the reviewer. We note
that in general these relate to fear responses, whilst our paradigm, which uses a threat of
shock manipulation, attempts to exploit anxiety responses. Fear can be thought of as a short
lasting response to a predictable, threatening stimulus, whereas anxiety can be thought of as
a response to unpredictable and prolonged threats. These different responses are
behaviourally, neurally and pharmacologically discrete (Davis, Walker, Miles, & Grillon,
2010; C Grillon, Ameli, Woods, Merikangas, & Davis, 1991; Christian Grillon, 2008).
However, we believe the reviewers raise an interesting point and have included this in our
discussion (p.16-17):
“It should be noted that our paradigm, which uses a threat of shock manipulation,
attempts to exploit anxiety and not fear responses. Fear can be thought of as a short lasting
response to a predictable, threatening stimulus, whereas anxiety can be thought of as a response
to unpredictable and prolonged threats. These different responses are behaviourally, neurally
and pharmacologically discrete (Davis et al., 2010; C Grillon et al., 1991; Christian Grillon,
2008). However, there is a large body of work on fear generalisation, in which fear responses
can transfer across stimuli. As a caveat, therefore, we recognise that it may be possible that
threat related behaviour spills over into the safe condition, in keeping with a large body of
research on fear conditioning and threat generalization in anxiety (Greenberg, Carlson, Cha,
Hajcak, & Mujica-Parodi, 2013; Morriss, Christakou, & van Reekum, 2015). Future work
could test this using between-subject designs.”
Could there be some uncertainty or distrust regarding potential shock in the safe
condition?
Participants are told that they will only receive a shock in the safe condition so we do not
believe there is potential for uncertainty or distrust. This is reflected in their anxiety ratings –
in which they show increased anxiety under threat relative to safe. However, we agree that
this is interesting and add a note to the discussion (p.17):
“In addition, participants are told that they will only receive a shock in the safe
condition. We do not believe there is potential for uncertainty or distrust, but future
research could also assess this directly using self-report trust measures.”
Fearful faces could prime such generalization behaviour.
This is possible, however at a perceived subjective level, retrospective ratings of anxiety in
the threat condition were significantly higher in the threat condition relative to the safe
condition, suggesting that the threat related behaviour has not spilled over into the safe
condition – at least to the same extent. Again, however, we add a note to the discussion
(p.17):
“Finally, whilst it is possible that the that fearful face stimuli could prime generalization
behaviour, it should be noted that subjective ratings of anxiety were still significantly
higher in the threat condition relative to the safe condition.”
Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_12
This is a re-submission of sorts of an earlier (rejected) manuscript, that includes new
data with new methods and new samples. The "Study 2" is in much better shape and
could be reviewed on its own. However I find the two fundamental flaws in Study 1: the
noisy, alcohol-laden environment and the two-short stimulus presentation, to be
unmanageable. There is no way to control for who may have been drinking, and no way
to fix a fundamental design flaw in the first study. I would be happy to look at the study
with the new data but the old data are not worth reviewing, in my opinion.
We are glad that the reviewer likes our second study, which replicates the first. We are
unsure, however, how to address this comment as we would prefer our first study (however
imperfect) be published, rather than languishing in a file drawer. We would rather present
study 1 and allow the reader to decide. As such, we respectfully decline to remove the first
study. We would also note that the “nature of the scientific engagement events also enabled
us to investigate effects within a more naturalistic setting than in highly controlled laboratory
conditions”. We believe this is interesting in its own right, but are also keen to expand and
continue the public engagement aspect of this work by taking the research all the way
through to publication.
Reviewer 3
Minor suggestions:
1) In this work, threat of shock increases reaction time, while fear (as a stimulus
attribute) reduces reaction time. Given that these two manipulations share many
affective characteristics, it would be interesting to know why they should have opposite
effects on reaction time. The authors might speculate on this in the discussion, and
perhaps propose future studies to address this distinction.
We propose that induced anxiety may increase reaction time because it promotes cautious
responding overall. The opposite effect that we observe with fearful stimuli may have resulted
because these stimuli capture attention (Yiend, 2010), and so are responded to more quickly.
We now add a note to the discussion (p14):
“Across studies, we replicated a previous finding that threat of shock slows down
reaction times to target ‘go’ stimuli (9,13,22). We propose that the faster responses to
fearful faces may have resulted because these stimuli capture attention (Yiend, 2010),
and so are responded to more quickly. This distinction could potentially be assessed in
future studies using a dot probe paradigm to measure attentional capture by threatening
context vs fearful faces (for examples see Asmundson & Stein, 1994; Koster, Crombez,
Verschuere, & De Houwer, 2004).”
2) It is interesting that the results from this study do not replicate their previous
facilitation of no-go accuracy as a function of threat. The authors provide a convincing
explanation for this discrepancy in the discussion: "Perhaps the presence of emotional
stimuli, especially fearful faces, was enough to focus attention on the task during the
safe conditions (i.e. prevent the engagement of a habitual go response) too and hence
reduce the threat safe differential. " However, it would be interesting to see this
explicitly tested. I realize that this is out of the scope of the current work, but it is
something that would be of interest to the field.
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and look forward to testing it in future research.
We also add a note to the discussion (p.16):
“Explicitly testing both neutral and emotional versions of this task in future work
would help clarify this.”
3) The authors mention in the discussion: "Here, we replicate the effect of condition on
reaction time, with threat of shock slowing down responses, but now also observe an
effect of valence on reaction time, with participants faster to respond to fearful faces.
This aligns with research demonstrating a bias towards fearful faces (10,14,26) under
threat of shock..." To me the second statement of this quote implies a condition by
valence interaction, which the authors do not find. I would recommend removing or
changing this statement in the revised version of the manuscript.
We appreciate that this has wrongly implied an interaction and have changed the manuscript
as follows (Page 15):
“Here, we replicate the effect of condition on reaction time, with threat of shock
slowing down responses, but now also observe a main effect of valence on reaction
time, with participants faster to respond to fearful faces across conditions."
