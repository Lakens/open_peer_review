The work described by Chakiri and Hodge provides a nice insight into alkyl migration and
dealkylation processes when using isopropyl-substituted arenes in Friedel-Crafts acylations. It
will certainly make a meaningful contribution to the field. The experimental section and the ESI
and detailed and accurate. I would recommend acceptance once the following minor comments
have been considered by the authors:
1) The authors conclude that the alkyl migration and dealkyation processes occur prior to
acylation based partly upon comparing 1H NMR yields of the benzoylbenzoic acids with
ISOLATED yields of the corresponding anthraquinones i.e. parts 1) and 2). To me, it would seem
more logical to compare the crude 1H NMR yields/ratios at both stages (acylation and
cyclisation) to get a more reliable data from which to make conclusions.
2) Flipping structures 4 and 6 horizontally would allow the author to more quickly understand
and rationalise product formation based on the starting materials.
3) Reference 4 is not cited within the main text.

In the submitted manuscript authors have reported Friedel-Crafts reactions of isopropyl-
substituted benzenes with phthalic anhydride in the presence of aluminium trichloride, followed
by cyclization of the products with strong sulfuric acid to synthesize anthraquinones. The
migration of isopropyl group seems to be interesting, however, I do not find it suitable to publish
in this Journal. Authors are advised to publish elsewhere.

Dear Professor Hodge:
Title: Synthesis of Isopropyl-substituted Anthraquinones via Friedel-Crafts Acylations: Migration

Manuscript ID: RSOS-170451
Thank you for submitting the above manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. On behalf of the
Editors and the Royal Society of Chemistry, I am pleased to inform you that your manuscript will
be accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science subject to minor revision in accordance
with the referee suggestions. Please find the reviewers' comments at the end of this email.
The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript. It should be noted that, although Referee 2 has recommended rejection, their
comments were based on the urgency of the work, which is not a concern for this journal. As the
Associate Editor and Referee 1 have reviewed the work and feel that it is publishable in this
journal, we are happy for you to disregard Referee 2's report. If you need to perform additional
experiments and require more time, please let us know as soon as possible.

Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship
criteria and are not included in the Funding statement.
Please note that we cannot publish your manuscript without these end statements included. We
have included a screenshot example of the end statements for reference. If you feel that a given
heading is not relevant to your paper, please nevertheless include the heading and explicitly state
that it is not relevant to your work.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days (i.e. by the 15-Jul-2017). If you do not think
you will be able to meet this date please let me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)

3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-170451)
Response to Referees’ Comments
1 The Referees query our comparison of molar ratios obtained from NMR spectra and by
isolation of the products.
Rearrangements are the main topic of the present research. We do not, therefore, believe the
above, which is only concerned with the extent of dealkylation, is a major issue.
Unfortunately, we do not have an NMR spectrum of the crude total quinone product from the
synthesis starting with 1,4-diisopropylanthraquinone. The student has now left the UK and PH
retired a few years ago. However, as reported, we find that in the synthesis starting from 1,3-
diisopropylanthraquinone the ratio non-dealkylated product to dealkylated product is 10:1 at the
benzoylbenzoic acid stage as determined by NMR spectroscopy; 10:1 at the quinone stage by
NMR spectroscopy; and 10.8:1 at the quinone stage by isolation of the products. This suggests
that comparing the proportions of isolated products is a reasonable estimate of the proportion of
each type formed.
2. Flipping structures 4 and 6?
Traditionally the unsubstituted positions in anthraquinones are labeled 1 to 8,
proceeding clockwise and starting at the top right. Hence our structures for the 2-
alkylanthraquinones. However, we have no strong views on this so have flipped our
structures to meet the Referee’s suggestion.
3. Reference 4
This has now been added.
4. Acknowledgments etc.
We have carefully checked and slightly expanded the acknowledgments etc.
