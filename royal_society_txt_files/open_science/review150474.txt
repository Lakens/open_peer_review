1) Reduced contact with entomopathogens has not been demosntrated. Butterfly pupae that do
not fix to a substrate either lie on soil surface (free) or penetrate into ants' nests
(myrmecophylous). They do not dig into the ground, as some moths do. So, why do the authors
compare entomopathogens in relatively deep (-10 cm) soil layers?
2) Data on Metarhizium infection are unconvincing. Of 47 Galleria larvae, 43 died, but only 19 of
the latter because of Metarhizium attack: what about the rest of the dead ones? How many larvae
would have died anyway? Authors worked with no control.
3) Beauveria is a very 'strong' entomopathogen. Isn't its higher abundance inside Myrmica nests
sufficient to 'compensate' for Metarhizium relative scarcity?
4) Statistics are flaired. Authors compare results from 166 randomly collected soil samples with
110 from Myrm. rubra nests and from 56 Myr. scabrinodis nests. Sample sizes are too different.
Each should have been subsampled.
5) Authors use the individual larva as their experimental unit. Is there no case of double
infection? We here have broad ground for pseudoreplication.

red imported fire ant studies with B. bassiana showed that non-sterile soil mitigated effects of B.
bassiana, suggesting an antagonistic effect of micro-organisms. See papers by R. M. Pereira.
Perhaps authors can include this work in their discussion. It would be interesting to see if
pathogens shown to me detrimental to Ma. alcon or G. alexis can be neutralized by ant hosts or in
ant host nests soil. This type of data would further support hypothesis.
Overall well written paper.

Although this new draft shows considerable improvements over the previous one, I am still
concerned about the comparison that authors make between results obtained from a number of
larvae and pupae of Glaucopsyche alexis and only one larva of Maculinea alcon (lines 152-153;
208-209). I realise that this may be due to concerns about working on an endangered species, but
in my view this comparison ought to be omitted altogether (and the M/S’s title ought to be
changed accordingly), thereby limiting the scopes of the paper to comparisons between soil
samples and their effects on Galleria mellonella.

Resubmission of RSOS-140442 “Reduced entomopathogen abundance in Myrmica ant nests
- is there an immunological benefit of myrmecophily?"
Dear Emilie Aime,
Thank you for allowing us to resubmit manuscript RSOS-140442, “Reduced
entomopathogen abundance in Myrmica ant nests - is there an immunological benefit of
myrmecophily?".
First, we have now integrated the previous supplementary material into the main
document to increase clarity of the manuscript and for easier reference.
Second we believe that we have now fully dealt with the comments and requests made by
the reviewers regarding the previous version of the manuscript, and hope that you can
consider this revised version for publication in RSOS. Below I have pasted the text of the
reviewers in 'courier new' followed by our explanation of how we have dealt with
each of the comments. The line numbers in our explanations refer to the new manuscript.
Corresponding line numbers in the original manuscript can then be found in the comments
of the reviewers.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
1) Reduced contact with entomopathogens has not been demosntrated.
Butterfly pupae that do not fix to a substrate either lie on soil
surface (free) or penetrate into ants' nests (myrmecophylous). They
do not dig into the ground, as some moths do. So, why do the authors
compare entomopathogens in relatively deep (-10 cm) soil layers?
While it is true that we have not demonstrated reduced contact with entomopathogens,
we consider it likely that the reduced abundance of entomopathogens will also lead to
reduced contact, but this aspect of the interaction was not explored in this paper. We have
investigated entomopathogens in the upper 10 cm of the soil layer, which includes the soil
surface, and homogenized the soil to detect any entomopathogens in this entire core. We
have modified the text to make this explicit (L. 64-65 and 73-74). We also collected samples
in this way so as to compare the environment of myrmecophilous caterpillars, which is in
the soil inside the ant nest, with the environment outside the ant nest in a way that the
presence of ants is the only difference between our ”treatment” and the ”control” group. If
we had compared soil from inside the ant nest with control soil only from the soil surface
we would not know whether potential differences in entomopathogen abundance were
due to the presence of ants or reflected variation in pathogen abundance between in soil vs
on top of soil. Lycaenid larvae that are not myrmecophilous may not dig very deeply into
9
the ground, but they often pupate under stones or among leaf-litter, so inside the soil
rather than freely on the surface.
2) Data on Metarhizium infection are unconvincing. Of 47 Galleria
larvae, 43 died, but only 19 of the latter because of Metarhizium
attack: what about the rest of the dead ones? How many larvae would
have died anyway? Authors worked with no control.
It is true that we cannot assign all caterpillars that died during the experiment to the
infection with Metarhizium brunneum, but we can do so for 19 out of 43 larvae of
Glaucopsyche alexis and 1 larva of Maculinea alcon. We therefore think that we can justify
our statement that larvae of both lycaenid species ”are susceptible to Metarhizium
brunneum” and that this fungus is potentially a threat to lycaenid larvae (L. 232-233).
Concerning the comparison of infections of different life stages of G. alexis we now avoided
the term “susceptibility” and only compare “mortality” (L. 204).
3) Beauveria is a very 'strong' entomopathogen. Isn't its higher
abundance inside Myrmica nests sufficient to 'compensate' for
Metarhizium relative scarcity?
Apparently not: the total number of Galleria mellonella larvae found dead with an
entomopathogenic fungus of any species (including Beauveria sp.) was significantly lower in
ant nests compared to controls (L. 187-190, Fig. 1). We have now made this explicit (L. 196-
199).
4) Statistics are flaired. Authors compare results from 166 randomly
collected soil samples with 110 from Myrm. rubra nests and from 56
Myr. scabrinodis nests. Sample sizes are too different. Each should
have been subsampled.
We agree that the statistical methods were not described sufficiently in the originally
submitted ms. We collected all samples (55 samples from M. rubra nests and their 55
controls and 28 samples from M. ruginodis nests and their 28 controls) in a paired design
with soil of an ant nest and soil of a control point nearby, forming a sample pair (L. 66-68).
We then used Generalized Linear Mixed Models to analyze our data (L. 170). In all these
models we included ”sample pair” (the ant nest sample and its control) as a random effect
to correct for variation in pathogen abundance between sample pairs. We have now added
a section to describe the statistical methods used in more detail (L. 169-184). The unequal
sample sizes between M. rubra and M. ruginodis could only affect the effect size. We have
therefore now given sample sizes in the results and the discussion (L. 191-193, 213, 224).
5) Authors use the individual larva as their experimental unit. Is
there no case of double infection? We here have broad ground for
pseudoreplication.
Our experimental unit was the death of a Galleria mellonella larva caused by pathogens in
the soil sample. We did not count multiple infections of the same individual, which would
have been pseudoreplication. We have made this explicit in the new version of the
manuscript (L. 199-201).

Comments to the Author(s)
Although this new draft shows considerable improvements over the
previous one, I am still concerned about the comparison that authors
make between results obtained from a number of larvae and pupae of
Glaucopsyche alexis and only one larva of Maculinea alcon (lines
152-153; 208-209). I realise that this may be due to concerns about
working on an endangered species, but in my view this comparison
ought to be omitted altogether (and the M/S’s title ought to be
changed accordingly), thereby limiting the scopes of the paper to
comparisons between soil samples and their effects on Galleria
mellonella.
We agree that the sample size of only one larva of Ma. alcon does not allow a comparison
between Ma. alcon and G. alexis. However, it is our opinion that we have never made a
comparison of any result between these two species in the ms and none of our conclusions
is based on such a comparison (see L. 234-248). We have tested the susceptibility of M.
alcon and G. alexis independently and reported the results independently (L. 203-212). We
have now added two sentences making this more explicit (L. 154-155; L. 211-212). Although
the conclusions in this manuscript are indeed mostly based on experiments with Ga.
mellonella, we feel that our experiments with lycaenid larvae are an important supplement
to the study because they show that actually myrmecophilous Lepidoptera are similarly
affected by M. brunneum than Ga. mellonella (which was only used as a ‘cheap’ model). We
therefore did not omit the infection experiments with G. alexis and Ma. alcon. The title of
the ms does, to our knowledge, not involve a comparison between M. alcon and G. alexis
and would not have been changed if the lycaenid infections were omitted. We therefore
left it unchanged.
In addition we have now also added sections for “Data accessibility”, “Competing
interests”, ”Authors’ contributions”, ”Aknowledgements” and ”Funding statement”,
according to the guidelines in your email.
Thank you for the rapid handling of the manuscript and the constructive comments. We
hope that the present manuscript is now suitable for publication in RSOS.

I have already reviewed this same draft weeks ago and have answered
that the title is misleding and that results from ONE and single
larva of M alcon (line 152) cannot be used in a scientific paper.
The only way of possibly saving this paper is by completely
redrafting it as outlined in my previous review.
We have now completely omitted the experiments with lycaenid caterpillars as requested
by reviewer 1 in a late stage of the review process and limited the paper to Galleria
mellonella as a ’model myrmecophile’. We changed the title of the ms to make this clear.
We also adjusted the abstract, introduction and discussion wherever the former
experiments were mentioned or explained.
Thank you for the rapid handling of the manuscript and the constructive comments. We
hope that the present manuscript is now suitable for publication in RSOS.
