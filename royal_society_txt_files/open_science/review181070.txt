Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Rosalind Arden):
Field experiments like this reported here are very valuable. Testing jackdaws responses to
inanimate objects that violate expectations is reasonable. However it is difficult for reviewers to
get a sense of statistical power in this study. It might be helpful to present relevant Ns in the
Abstract and to set out that analytical strategy more clearly (including descriptive statistics).
Subject Editor's Comments to Author:
If the authors can respond to the AE's statistical concerns, we could consider a resubmitted
manuscript. Please be sure to address all points carefully. Could you also please define "animacy
discriminations" and "animacy expectations" in operational terms? thanks

Dear Authors
While I in general like the type of question you are addressing, the results do not in my mind
allow for the interpretation as you have done. As you will see from the comments file (Appendix
B) the main issue I have is with the supposed animacy expectations and categorisation of objects
by the subjects; reaction to novel stimuli is in my opinion the better explanation. I also question
the ecological relevance of the stimuli, in particular the snakes as there was no evidence that the
birds did see these as representative of real snakes.
Lastly, and most importantly, the description of the stimulus presentation to the jackdaws
suggest that with every new jackdaw arriving the focal bird may have been exposed again to the
same stimuli. Without taking the number of these "indirect" stimuli presentations into account in
the analysis, it is impossible for me to assess if any of the results are based on the differences
between the different stimuli categories.

label_comment_2
I found the manuscript very well written and tackling an interesting topic of expectancy-violation
of animacy in wild jackdaws. Especially the ecological validity of the approach and conducting
these experiments on free ranging individuals are very strong points of this study.
Also, providing the full data set along with the R-code greatly enhanced evaluation of the results
and allowed to follow the analysis step by step.
My main point of critique or concern with the data analysis and the interpretation relates to
discarding the possibility that jackdaws may exhibit a pareidolic search image, leading to false
positive responses to moving sticks.
In my opinion it is crucial to clearly discern jackdaws mistaking the moving branch for a snake
from the hypothesis put forth by the authors. It might be an interesting addition to the current
explanation.
This could be achieved by including a quantitative measure of ‘startle-’ or fear responses in the
analysis.
If the extended time to enter the nest box in the moving stick condition is indeed attributed to
information gathering rather than fear, there should be significant differences in subsets of
groups (moving snake vs. moving stick).
Further, birds that have seen the snake model moving first might be primed to evaluate moving
branches as snakes, whereas this might not be the case for bids that have seen moving branches
first? Analysing the fear responses and/or latency to enter the nestbox sequence of objects in
more detail might be telling.
Overall, I think this is a study that would merit publication once it addresses the issue raised
above and smaller detailed issues below.
#####
Line 92-93: What about sit and wait predators such as some snakes?
#####
Line 142-145: Is there a reason why a control condition for sound without any additional stimuli
has not been conducted?
#####
Line 170: Could “scolding” or mobbing calls be taken as a quantitative measure for analysis?
5
#####
Line 172-176: Therefore, if I understand correctly, some individuals were exposed to longer/more
movement of the stimuli.
Since movement definitely had an effect on the reaction to the stimulus it would be crucial to
state clearly if movement-exposure was the same for every bird. If this was not the case, could
this be factored in the analysis?
#####
Line 192-194: Could this fear behaviour be factored in the analysis as a quantitative measure to
ensure delay in entering the nestbox in the stick condition indeed reflected information gathering
and not fear (e.g. mistaking the stick for a moving snake)
#####
Line 196: Could the authors provide the rationale for using the 20 min as cut-off point? If this
time was chosen arbitrarily it seems rather long, why not use 10 min? From plotting the
histogram of latency to enter the nest box it seems most entrances occurred within the first 500
sec. This would also strengthen the argument that the delay would be related to the
stimulus/trigger and not to possibly other environmental factors.
#####
Lines 213-214: Why has this very conservative selection process been applied?
For me the full binomial model fails to reach conversion. I believe this is due to the fact that this
initial model contains too many factors for the sample size (especially when including the
interaction of movement with stimulus). This might be a minor issue as the way around is to
focus on the relevant factors, which occurs naturally in the model selection process, but on the
other hand it might lead to kicking out said interaction prematurely?
#####
Lines 268-271: An alternative hypothesis might be that individuals have a search image for long
moving items wich are categorised as snakes and therefore elicit fear. It might be able to tease this
hypothesis apart from the argument the authors put forth by looking more closely at a
quantitative measure of fear responses in the stick vs. snake condition
#####
Line 284-285: Time to enter nest box as information gathering? Why not fear response as argued
in the lines above?

I am logging a reject/resub recommendation because it will give the authors more time to revise
than permitted in our "revision" decision. The reviewers raise some serious concerns about study
design and inferences made, as well as many other points. These issues will have to be resolved
in the next version, should the authors decide to resubmit, because otherwise we will not be able
to consider the submission further. Thanks for considering Royal Society Open Science.

Quantitative research with wild animals is hard to do, so this manuscript is immediately exciting
to read. Both Reviewers comment that this work is interesting and worthwhile. Both Reviewers
would like to see some revisions. Detailed comments follow. I always prefer to see a table of basic
descriptive statistics leading the Results, because it provides an at-a-glance way to see how many
units were tested and what the range of responses was. Authors are so familiar with their own
work that sometimes it is not obvious that a naive reader may have to work out whether the
relevant unit is 'the next box' or 'the bird' or what. This is a general point, which I hope you don't
object to my making. Good luck with the Revision!

First of all, I think that the manuscript has improved and I am much more in agreement with how
you have worded the text than before. I am still not 100% convinced that the subjects reacted to
expectation violations, rather than just novelty (I disagree with your response to my comment
that reaction to novelty requires an expectation violation to occur, but this seems to be more of a
theoretical discussion rather than one that can be backed up by the current literature, and thus
does not warrant rejection of your interpretation).
Aside from the smaller comments I would ask that you consider adding in definitions for
"categorisation" and "expectation" as the terms used in the text are common in that field, but have
slightly different meanings in others, and, as you have stated yourself, this journal is for a
broader audience. It will allow the average reader to better follow exactly what you mean when
using these terms.

Appendix A
We appreciate the comments offered by both Editors with regards to our manuscript
and hope the following addresses their concerns:
- We have specified total sample size in the abstract
- We have removed the phrases "animacy discriminations" and "animacy
expectations", and instead explain our predictions/arguments in clear,
straightforward language
- For maximal clarity, we have added explicit sample sizes for each analysis in the
methods section on lines 209-210, 217.
In addition to those changes our paper contains the following:
- The Methods contain a detailed and extensive explanation of our analytical strategy
(lines starting line 202). This includes: (i) specifying the sample size ; (ii) specifying
response and explanatory variables, random terms, and data distributions; and (iii)
an explanation of the model comparison procedures.
- In the Results section, we report full tables of results for the model selection
procedure (Table 1, Table S1) as well as state in text the sample sizes, effect sizes
(with SE) and AIC/p values as relevant for each analysis.
- We note that we adopt the model selection procedure advocated by Burnham and
Anderson, adhering to strict model selection guidelines which only consider models to
be a better fit if they reduce AIC values by at least 10. This is a stricter standard that
adopted by a lot of the field of comparative cognition, which sets the threshold for
model selection at a decrease of 2 in AIC.
Appendix B
General
While the authors had diverging behaviours between their stimuli, the choice of
stimuli and other methodological problems make any strong interpretation difficult
to impossible (see detailed comments below). In general the study does show an
effect, but the reliance on categorisation and animacy expectation is not
supportable. Reactions to novelty and contrast would seemingly suffice to describe
the results. In particular as some of the referenced literature suggests a sensitivity in
animals to biological movement over other types of movement; the presented
stimuli moved back and forth for 10 s in a jerking manner (at least according to the
description and video) and thus would most likely not have been seen as animate.
A more difficult factor to evaluate is the presentation of the stimuli: the text
suggests that the first bird that approached was the focal bird, but that with every
new arrival the stimuli was presented again. If true, this could potentially have led
to a much higher number of observations for some focal birds than others, a factor
that was not included in the analysis.
In general I think the results are interesting albeit in a much more limited context.
Detailed Comments
Line 49/50 Independent motion is a bit imprecise, as all movement is to a lesser or
larger degree dependent on the laws of physics; “self-propelled”, as is used in other
publications, may be a better option
Line 51 “which can move on their own accord” is ambiguous as animate can mean
both alive and capable of voluntary motion, so the sentence fragment can be seen
as a descriptive of the animate/moving object or the specification of a subset of an
animate/living object
Line 54 Categorisation is a higher-level cognitive task; I am not convinced that it is
required in the prediction of objects’ movements
Line 55-57 As this sentence follows the question about the adaptive purpose I find
the suggested functions suspect as they are higher-level cognitive processes which if
we are discussing the causes for animals have little relevance to most species; in
particular the misattribution of causality is surely not an underlying cause for the
selection of this ability. The reference used here is also questionable; I do not have
access to this particular book , so I can not verify that the reference is not
applicable, but the title of the chapter “Aristotle and the chicken: animacy and the
origin of beliefs“ does not suggest an adequate and up to date reference to
suggest an answer to the question of the adaptive nature of differentiating between
different types of motion in humans
Line 58 the use of “categories” presupposes that the animal forms such categories,
which as a skill has not been shown in most species
Line 60 As mentioned above, “animacy” would need to be defined better before
using it in a descriptive way
Line 61-63 As the study with Japanese macaques used only inanimate objects, it is
difficult to conclude that this must have been due to “violation of animacy norms”;
similarly Hauser suggests that the tamarins looking behaviour could have been
affected by animacy, but that the results are not conclusive
Line 63/64 “including some” suggests that there are more than one; as the
references refer to one species of dog and fish it is imprecise
Line 65-67 Di Giorgio et al. state that the infants have a predisposition to attend to
motion, which later in life is used to categorize
Line 70-72 As the aim of the study is attention to movement, and not categorisation,
focussing on this aspect would be more appropriate
Line 76 [9] or similar empirical studies would be a better reference here
Line 81-83 the similarity explanation for the results is not very strong on the basis of
this reference as the results are based on one feature similar to an animate object
showing a difference while another feature did not
Line 85-86 I am not sure if the animacy had as function to promote empathy, rather
than being a prerequisite to have empathy by recognizing on the basis of animacy
that the individual was in distress
Line 93-95 This sentence is not clear in its applicability to this study: being able to
recognize a potential moving threat before it moves is different from differentiating
between animate and inanimate object movement. As the differentiation has to
occur before the individual can react to the non-moving version, there is a required
learning step that is not tested here.
Line 97 “can form expectations” is misleading as it presupposes that the stimuli used
are ones where the subjects have expectations, something I am not convinced of
(see comments on methodology/stimuli)
Line 98-100 I am unclear on the line of reasoning here: are the authors suggesting
that the corvids’ understanding of the physical world would make them better at
having expectations for the inanimate object movement?
Line 100-102 Would this reaction to novelty not be a simpler explanation to any
reaction towards the stimuli, rather than the more complex categorisation and
expectancy violation? Could differences in reactions be attributed to the degree of
novelty seen?
Line 106-107 ecologically relevant & potential threat level; as neither the reaction to
the stimuli VS the real object, nor the relevance of a perfect dummy version to the
ecology of the species has been demonstrated (e.g. are jackdaw nests predated
upon by snakes in particular V. berus?) any interpretation in this direction is
speculative
Line 113-118 Why did the authors decide to forego the common measure of looking
time preference? Was there a theoretical, methodological or ecological reason?
Line 130-131 As entering the nest box is a measure it would be interesting to know a
bit more about the setup, i.e. a diagram showing the position of the nest box and
the stimuli, but also the behaviour and risks associated with the normal behaviour
at the nest boxes, e.g. the visitation and nest predation rate
Line 137 “camouflaged”: did the subjects show a habituation or lack of response to
these, or is this a subjective assessment by the authors? The level of camouflage is
also questionable as the video clearly shows unnatural building materials having
been used for the platform underneath the track and behind the stimuli track, and
thus the camouflaged object does not blend into the background.
Line 144 The distance travelled would also be relevant
Line 148 “non-threatening” to the subject, the nest or both? If the passerine could
act even as a nuisance, e.g. stealing nesting material, would the jackdaw enter the
nest more quickly to defend this resource?
Line 149 “threatening” to the subject, the nest or both? Are jackdaws predated
upon by snakes? Would they mob a snake? If so, was this behaviour observed?
Line 150 “implausible stimulus when moving”: sticks move but not in the manner
presented here; a stick moving in the wind or dropping from the trees would be
quite plausible
Line 153 “similar patterns” to the subjects or to the authors? The wild-type V. berus
has a clear zig-zag pattern on its back, and while melanistic individuals exist, their
presence is more often in colder climates, e.g. Scandinavia, and the model used
does not have the distinct triangular head of V. berus
Line 156 Was there a particular reason why the Moving and Non-moving trials for
each stimuli type were done successively?
Line 161-162 Is the nest visitation rate constant for this time period? Is nest defence
comparable over this time period?
Line 166-167 How long did this swapping take?
Line 168 Exactly 2m or approximately? How was this assessed?
Line 169 How precise? At what distance could a jackdaw see the nest box?
Line 171-172 After the first approach, would the jackdaw know there was an object
even if obstructed?
Line 172-173 The video and speed mentioned above suggests that a 10s movement
would include several directional changes. Was this constant? Did some
presentations have more or less changes in movement?
Line 174-176 Why was the stimulus retriggered for every approaching jackdaw? This
presumably resulted in a difference in the number of presentations each focal
individual was subjected to?
Line 180-182 Is it not “If at a nest box no jackdaw approached for two consecutive
trials”?
Line 182-185 This is not clear: if the first bird to approach is the focal bird, then how
can a non-focal bird enter the nest box before the focal bird approached? And how
is the focal bird out of view: out of the experimenters view? Not able to see the nest
box? How was this determined?
Line 185-187 As the entering of the nest box by a non-focal was found to be a
significant factor in the analysis despite the low number of occurrences, I am not
sure that a mere similarity can warrant the inclusion of those trials. I also question
the validity of the “similarity”: at least one of the significant effects is no longer
significant after removal of those trials. Also: are the results for the stick and snake
reversed in the SI table? With the trials the snake is not significant while the stick is,
but without the trials the reverse is true.
Line 189-192 I would prefer this information already in the introduction when the
deviation from the lab parameters was first mentioned
Line 196-197 Is the inclusion of any time not observed validated?
Line 206-207 Why was the identity of the focal bird not entered as a random factor?
Line 217-218 By trigger, is the first trigger the focal bird saw meant or the last
trigger presented to any bird approaching?
Line 226-228 While the above description suggested one trial a day for 6
consecutive days, here it is stated that the three stimuli were presented on three
consecutive days, which in turn suggests that both the Moving and the Non-Moving
trials of each stimuli were done on the same day. If the expectancy of movement is
the main trigger (as has been argued) then should there not be an analysis of the
interaction between stimulus and order within a stimulus pair?
Line 254-256 This is an interpretation of the data and should be in the discussion
Line 264-265 Two references is a bit meagre for a “widely” held assumption; in
addition in the introduction a paper is referenced where fish react to motion in a
predation context
Line 267-269 This is far too speculative as it presupposes that the subjects have
movement expectations for the stimuli, something that can not be shown with the
data here. It is a possibility, that this was the reason, but in no way the only one.
Line 269-271 The results suggest only that jackdaws differentiate between the
different stimuli used; why that is the case is another question entirely and without
the answer leaves any interpretation of the data beyond that as speculative.
Line 273-275 Is it surprising that only about a third of subjects were startled?
Line 277 “a heightened threat” is an assumption by the authors; novel stimuli are
treated as potential threats, but the indication of a true heightened threat would
require evidence that the birds saw the stimuli as such.
Line 282-283 To what degree is this due to the flying away? Was there a large
enough proportion of jackdaws leaving that the startled category became
significantly different, while the other startle behaviours had little effect?
Line 284 The term “inspect the stimulus” has been used, but what does it mean?
The experimenter was not, as mentioned, able to see the gaze of the birds; did they
interact with the stimulus?
Line 285-288 Could it not also be due to differences in contrast? The snakes models
would possibly stand out more on the platform even when not moving than the
sticks. Or that visually the snake model was more novel than the stick but when
movement comes into play both are similarly novel?
Line 290 or not novel
Line 290-291 Without an estimate of the size of each stimuli it is difficult to evaluate
the difference between the different reactions. If the non-moving snake by virtue of
greater contrast was more novel but the sticks when moving presented more
movement of area, then novelty and contrast could explain the difference.
Line 292-294 Suggesting the possible question the subject is asking itself is
anthropomorphising, which is not necessary when describing behaviour here.
Line 294-296 But could the neophobia not be an explanation for the delay in
entering the nest, without requiring a sense of animacy violation?
Line 301-304 The results show that they react differently to the different stimuli;
any animacy expectation would still need to be shown
Line 307-308 “in birds especially” is a weird comment to make about imprinting
when most (if not all) examples of filial imprinting come from birds
Line 308-312 Similar to the introduction, the connection between general physical
knowledge and animacy expectation is not well supported.
Line 318 Unless they are upright
Line 321-323 True, but as neither can be suggested here, a further speculation is not
necessary
Line 327-330 As it is not clear what caused the reactions by the subjects, it is
impossible to state where the observed behaviour plays any role in the wild, and if it
is an important role.
Appendix C
Comments from the first submission:
Editor comments to Author:
I am logging a reject/resub recommendation because it will give the authors
more time to revise than permitted in our "revision" decision. The reviewers
raise some serious concerns about study design and inferences made, as well
as many other points. These issues will have to be resolved in the next version,
should the authors decide to resubmit, because otherwise we will not be able
to consider the submission further. Thanks for considering Royal Society
Open Science.
Comments to the Author:
label_comment_11
Quantitative research with wild animals is hard to do, so this manuscript is
immediately exciting to read. Both Reviewers comment that this work is
interesting and worthwhile. Both Reviewers would like to see some revisions.
Detailed comments follow. I always prefer to see a table of basic descriptive
statistics leading the Results, because it provides an at-a-glance way to see
how many units were tested and what the range of responses was. Authors are
so familiar with their own work that sometimes it is not obvious that a naive
reader may have to work out whether the relevant unit is 'the next box' or 'the
bird' or what. This is a general point, which I hope you don't object to my
making. Good luck with the Revision!
Thank you. We appreciate the Editor’s encouragement on the merit of our
study, especially with regards to being conducted in the wild. We have
addressed all the reviewers’ comments in detail below and have added a table
with basic descriptive statistics to the beginning of the Results section (new
Table 1, referenced Lines 260-261).
Reviewer: 1
Dear Authors
While I in general like the type of question you are addressing, the results do
not in my mind allow for the interpretation as you have done. As you will see
from the comments file the main issue I have is with the supposed animacy
expectations and categorisation of objects by the subjects; reaction to novel
stimuli is in my opinion the better explanation. I also question the ecological
relevance of the stimuli, in particular the snakes as there was no evidence that
the birds did see these as representative of real snakes.
We appreciate this reviewer’s concerns and have addressed their suggestions
below in detail alongside their specific comments.
Lastly, and most importantly, the description of the stimulus presentation to
the jackdaws suggest that with every new jackdaw arriving the focal bird may
have been exposed again to the same stimuli. Without taking the number of
these "indirect" stimuli presentations into account in the analysis, it is
impossible for me to assess if any of the results are based on the differences
between the different stimuli categories.
While we agree with the reviewer that the multiple arrivals by the focal bird
adds some noise to the data, this cannot have biased the results towards any
particular category (as explained below when this point is raised, we have also
now added additional analyses to help support this conclusion, Table S1).
Since it is impossible to control the behaviour of wild birds, by triggering the
motor every time a bird arrived, we ensured that every arriving bird had the
exact same stimulus experience during each arrival. Had we not done so (i.e.
had we only triggered it at the first arrival), we would have increased the
likelihood that the focal bird’s partner had a different experience and thus
different information about the stimulus. Additionally, for a bird that arrived
multiple times and saw multiple triggers, we could be sure that they had in
fact experienced the trigger before they decided to enter.
While the authors had diverging behaviours between their stimuli, the choice
of stimuli and other methodological problems make any strong interpretation
difficult to impossible (see detailed comments below). In general the study
does show an effect, but the reliance on categorisation and animacy
expectation is not supportable. Reactions to novelty and contrast would
seemingly suffice to describe the results. In particular as some of the
referenced literature suggests a sensitivity in animals to biological movement
over other types of movement; the presented stimuli moved back and forth for
10 s in a jerking manner (at least according to the description and video) and
thus would most likely not have been seen as animate.
We understand the reviewer’s concerns, but would argue that responses to
novelty do not preclude animacy categorisations. To clarify our arguments
and avoid any confusion, we now provide additional explanations of this
important point. In addition to our original explanations about the potential for
neophobia to guide animacy distinctions (Lines 101-104, 365-367), we have
added greater reference to this idea in the discussion, while removing other
points about novelty responses (e.g. neophilia) for clarity (Lines 343-345,
368-371). Our reasoning is thus: even if one were to imagine that the
responses were entirely based on reactions to novelty, the question then
becomes, why was movement perceived as more novel in some conditions
than others? Such a distinction suggests that jackdaws were less likely to
expect the stick to move than the bird or snake to move, i.e. the stick
movement was more of a novel occurrence to them. In other words, jackdaws
appear to recognise that there is something more unusual about a moving stick
than a moving bird or snake. Considering that they treated both exemplars of
the stick stimuli similarly, their responses imply that they categorise sticks as
objects that should not move. Thus an explanation purely on novelty alone
still suggests that the bird’s responses are based upon the potential for
movement in the stimuli we presented. That being said, we feel that novelty
responses are only one of several potential explanations that deserve
discussion based on the existing body of literature which studies “core
knowledge” concepts. We explicitly do not presume to ascribe jackdaws’
responses to an underlying novelty or “core knowledge” mechanisms (Lines
41-42, 68-72, 350-376), and even suggest what research could be done in
future to clarify the relative influence of these factors (Lines 376-378).
Additionally, we agree with the reviewer that there are studies which suggest
that animals can distinguish biological from non-biological movement, and
discuss these in the paper (e.g. reference [9]). Since a snake and bird
fundamentally move differently, there was no way to offer identical
movement patterns that would be equally biologically relevant for both of
them. Had we used different movement patterns for each of our stimuli, then it
would have been impossible to distinguish between explanations of movement
type and stimulus type in the analysis. This is why we chose to have all
stimuli move the same, so that they only differed in their physical appearance,
not in their form of animacy. Had we found no differences in responses
toward the stimuli, then we could certainly consider that the lack of equal
biologically relevant movement to be the cause. However, since we did find
differences between the stimuli types, despite the potential divergence from
true biological movement, we think our results more strongly suggest a
distinction based on stimuli type. Nevertheless, we concede that our results
are not definitive, and thus use suitably cautious language (e.g. “suggests”,
instead of “shows” or “demonstrates”, Lines 328, 339, 378; the addition of
“may” in discussing all of our larger conclusions, Lines 43, 304, 310, 323,
328, 334, 340, 367, 378, 382) and consider alternative explanations in depth
(Lines 362-371). Additionally, we now explicitly reference the artificial
movement of the bird (Lines 332-333), but note that despite this movement,
the jackdaws treated the moving and non-moving bird similarly.
A more difficult factor to evaluate is the presentation of the stimuli: the text
suggests that the first bird that approached was the focal bird, but that with
every new arrival the stimuli was presented again. If true, this could
potentially have led to a much higher number of observations for some focal
birds than others, a factor that was not included in the analysis.
In general I think the results are interesting albeit in a much more limited
context.
In our response above we justified our use of multiple stimulus triggers when
multiple approaches occurred. Given the sample size of our experiment and
the number of factors already being investigated, we chose to first look at the
variation in number of approaches between conditions before adding them to
the model. Since there was hardly any variation between conditions in the
number of triggers, we feel strongly that the number of approaches did not
influence the differences we found between conditions. In order to help
illustrate this to readers, we have: 1) included a new column in the raw data
file which states the number of triggers per trial; 2) calculated the mean (±SE)
of the number of triggers per condition (of stimulus type and movement type)
to show that there was no difference between the trial types in the number of
triggers birds experienced. This additional data summary is referenced on
Lines 188-189, and a summary table has been added to the electronic
supplementary material (Table S1). We have also updated the R code file to
allow readers to calculate and evaluate these numbers themselves.
Detailed Comments
Line 49/50 Independent motion is a bit imprecise, as all movement is to a
lesser or larger degree dependent on the laws of physics; “self-propelled”, as
is used in other publications, may be a better option
We have changed the word “independent” to “self-propelled”.
Line 51 “which can move on their own accord” is ambiguous as animate can
mean both alive and capable of voluntary motion, so the sentence fragment
can be seen as a descriptive of the animate/moving object or the specification
of a subset of an animate/living object
We have changed the sentence fragment to make its description clearer
Line 54 Categorisation is a higher-level cognitive task; I am not convinced
that it is required in the prediction of objects’ movements
While we appreciate the reviewer’s concern, we do not intend to imply
higher-order cognitive processes via the use of the term “categorization”,
since we are looking at categorization from an operational standpoint (i.e.
classifying or differentiating cues based upon perceptual or conceptual
similarity, as defined by Shettleworth in her 2010 book). This perspective on
categorization is widely held by many and has been demonstrated in species
ranging from honey bees (Giurfa M. 2003 “Cognitive neuroethology:
dissecting non-elemental learning in a honeybee brain”. Curr. Opin.
Neurobiol), to fish (Bsharry, et al., 2002, “Fish cognition: a primate’s eye
view”, Animal Cognition), to pigeons (Wasserman, et al., 1998, “Conceptual
Behavior in Pigeons: Categories, Subcategories, and Pseudocategories”,
Journal of Experimental Psychology). Since corvids are known to categorize
objects in other contexts, for example, on the basis of experience (Greggor, et
al 2016, “Street smart…”Animal Behaviour; detail now added Line 102), we
would argue that it should not be surprising that they categorize objects on the
basis of movement capabilities. However, we make sure to emphasize that this
categorization could be based purely on simple associations instead of a “core
knowledge” concept of animate categories (Lines 362-371). Additionally, we
have added detail to the discussion to make it clear that our use of the word
“categorization” does not imply that jackdaws categorize all inanimate objects
similarly, since experience with different classes of inanimate objects (e.g.
rocks, sticks, dirt) could arise separately (Lines 371-374)
Line 55-57 As this sentence follows the question about the adaptive purpose I
find the suggested functions suspect as they are higher-level cognitive
processes which if we are discussing the causes for animals have little
relevance to most species; in particular the misattribution of causality is
surely not an underlying cause for the selection of this ability. The reference
used here is also questionable; I do not have access to this particular book ,
so I can not verify that the reference is not applicable, but the title of the
chapter “Aristotle and the chicken: animacy and the origin of beliefs“ does
not suggest an adequate and up to date reference to suggest an answer to the
question of the adaptive nature of differentiating between different types of
motion in humans
Since humans have often been the main focus of animacy research, our
discussion about animacy categorizations in humans is merely intended to
place our paper in a wider interspecific context. We felt mentioning this
broader context was especially important for a non-specialist journal that
attracts readers from many disciplines. We do not dwell on this throughout the
paper, and merely use it as an introductory point in setting up the justification
for our study. We have tried to be very clear that this sentence presents
arguments for the adaptive purpose in humans but that this question has
received little attention in other species (lines 55-59), setting up the logic for
the focus of our work.
The book chapter in question that we cited was written recently (2012), by a
leader in the field of animacy research, and can be found free online (a Google
Scholar search will retrieve it). The chapter specifically addresses the
potential differences in animacy distinctions between species, as evidenced
even in the abstract “There has been a long road from the primitive animacy
detectors that we can see operating even in simple brains to the intricacies of
agency attribution and theory of mind of human beings. Nonetheless, the
origins of beliefs in supernatural things seem to be deeply rooted in the natural
history of animacy detection” (pg. 189). Therefore, we have decided to retain
this reference and discussion point in our introduction.
Line 58 the use of “categories” presupposes that the animal forms such
categories, which as a skill has not been shown in most species.
As explained above, we use a functional definition for categories, in which a
category can be identified when animals respond in distinct ways to different
stimuli. When defined this way, this is an ability that is widespread throughout
the animal kingdom, e.g. honey bees to fish, to pigeons (see references in
above response).
Line 60 As mentioned above, “animacy” would need to be defined better
before using it in a
descriptive way.
In response to the reviewer, we have changed this to “object animacy” so it is
clear that we are referring to the type of animacy that is explicitly defined on
line 51.
Line 61-63 As the study with Japanese macaques used only inanimate objects,
it is difficult to
conclude that this must have been due to “violation of animacy norms”;
similarly Hauser suggests that the tamarins looking behaviour could have
been affected by animacy, but that the results are not conclusive
We have reworded the phrase to say “violate expectations about animacy
norms” because the studies’ designs specifically looked at responses towards
expected and unexpected motion conditions, based on natural rules of
animacy. For instance, while the Hauser does indeed explore a variety of
explanations for his results, he concludes that the results “suggest that cotton-
top tamarins form different expectations about an object’s potential capacity
to move to a new location” (pg 35). To highlight the fact that this relevant
evidence may not be definitive, we have added the phrase “There is evidence
to suggest…” on lines 61-62.
Line 63/64 “including some” suggests that there are more than one; as the
references refer to one species of dog and fish it is imprecise
We have reworded “including some” to “including species of” to make the
wording more precise.
Line 65-67 Di Giorgio et al. state that the infants have a predisposition to
attend to motion, which later in life is used to categorize
We have reworded the phrase in question to clarify the point the reviewer
suggests.
Line 70-72 As the aim of the study is attention to movement, and not
categorisation, focussing on this aspect would be more appropriate
As per our previous responses, since categorisation can be defined by the
differentiation of responses to distinct stimuli, we feel our study focus does
not imply higher order cognitive processes and thus has an appropriate scope.
Line 76 [9] or similar empirical studies would be a better reference here
We have added reference [9] to the line, as the reviewer suggested.
Line 81-83 the similarity explanation for the results is not very strong on the
basis of this reference as the results are based on one feature similar to an
animate object showing a difference while another feature did not
In response to the reviewer’s concern that the results were not very strong, we
have softened the wording in this sentence to say that the study “suggested”
instead of “showed”.
Line 85-86 I am not sure if the animacy had as function to promote empathy,
rather than being a prerequisite to have empathy by recognizing on the basis
of animacy that the individual was in distress
Based on the reviewer’s comment, we have reworded the phrase in question to
avoid potential confusion.
Line 93-95 This sentence is not clear in its applicability to this study: being
able to recognize a potential moving threat before it moves is different from
differentiating between animate and inanimate object movement. As the
differentiation has to occur before the individual can react to the non-moving
version, there is a required learning step that is not tested here.
The sentence is intended to introduce a new topic, which helps justify the
study, namely that a potential function of animacy categorization could be to
anticipate the movement of potential threats. The reviewer is correct that we
did not test learning, nor did we intend to by bringing up the potential
ecological function of animacy categorization. In fact, we try to be explicit in
not presuming the origin of any of the effects that we find, by including
discussion of multiple origins of animacy categories (Lines 41-42, 68-72, 350-
376).
Line 97 “can form expectations” is misleading as it presupposes that the
stimuli used are ones where the subjects have expectations, something I am
not convinced of (see comments on methodology/stimuli)
“Expectation” and “expectancy” are commonly used in the animal cognition
literature on animacy (see ref [5], plus Hauser, 1997, Dev Sci), on physical
cognition (Vallortigara, et al., 2010, Wily Interdisciplinary Reviews), and on
social cognition (Massen, et al, 2014, Nature), in the context of associatively
learned information. In this way the term “expectation” need not imply other
types of cognitive processes that the reviewer may be eluding to here.
Line 98-100 I am unclear on the line of reasoning here: are the authors
suggesting that the corvids’ understanding of the physical world would make
them better at having expectations for the inanimate object movement?
Yes, the reviewer is correct that we intended to say that the evidence
accumulated on corvids’ understanding of the physical world, (both in their
understanding of object properties and similarities to primate physical
cognition), make them good candidates for investigating the existence of
animacy expectations.
Line 100-102 Would this reaction to novelty not be a simpler explanation to
any reaction towards the stimuli, rather than the more complex categorisation
and expectancy violation? Could differences in reactions be attributed to the
degree of novelty seen?
In line with our response on this topic above, we have now restructured the
discussion and added additional explanations surrounding novelty to the text
(Lines 365-367, 368-371). We also explained that the presence of a novelty
response does not preclude the existence of animacy categories since an
explanation purely on novelty alone still suggests that the bird’s responses are
based upon the potential for movement in the stimuli we presented. In other
words, if the birds find the movement of certain stimuli more novel then
others, this would suggest that they have expectations of what should and
shouldn’t move on its own accord.
Line 106-107 ecologically relevant & potential threat level; as neither the
reaction to the stimuli VS the real object, nor the relevance of a perfect
dummy version to the ecology of the species has been demonstrated (e.g. are
jackdaw nests predated upon by snakes in particular V. berus?) any
interpretation in this direction is speculative
Based on the types of objects used in tests of animacy categorizations in the
literature (e.g. point light displays, or shapes on a screen; discussed lines 80-
82), the objects we use are much closer to ecologically relevant stimuli than is
common. The birds, snakes and sticks we use are as close as we could
physically get to the stimuli we were trying to mimic. For instance, the birds
were actual specimens of their species; detail added Lines 157-159. While
snakes are not the most common nest predator for jackdaws, they are known
to predate nestlings (referenced in [27]) and were the optimal predatory model
to control for the size of the stimulus. We also have now noted that model
snakes have been successfully used in a number of previous studies on birds,
including corvids (refs [25,26], cited on Lines 161-162). We have added
additional details about the snake species in response to the reviewer’s
comment (Lines 162-163).
Line 113-118 Why did the authors decide to forego the common measure of
looking time
preference? Was there a theoretical, methodological or ecological reason?
Assessing looking time is not feasible for wild birds because of their wide
visual field. We have rephrased the sentence to provide a brief explanation
about why we did not use the common looking time measure (now line 115-
116), and we justify our decision in detail in the methods section in lines 203-
206.
Line 130-131 As entering the nest box is a measure it would be interesting to
know a bit more about the setup, i.e. a diagram showing the position of the
nest box and the stimuli, but also the behaviour and risks associated with the
normal behaviour at the nest boxes, e.g. the visitation and nest predation rate
We have now added a reference to a study that uses the same nestbox setup,
with diagrams of the nestbox, its platform, and where stimuli can be placed
([24] cited on lines 134-135). This study also details general visitation rates
without stimuli on the boxes (something which was not specifically assessed
in this study).
Line 137 “camouflaged”: did the subjects show a habituation or lack of
response to these, or is this a subjective assessment by the authors? The level
of camouflage is also questionable as the video clearly shows unnatural
building materials having been used for the platform underneath the track and
behind the stimuli track, and thus the camouflaged object does not blend into
the background.
In our previous work on jackdaws at their nest boxes ([24]), we found that
visitation rates returned to their baseline rates after a bird enters their nest box
several times. In theory therefore, the birds should have habituated within the
same day that the box was put out. In order to be 100% sure the birds had
habituated to the box, we extended that period to at least five days. The
building materials that can be seen in the videos are part of the nest boxes
themselves and camouflage tape was wrapped around the housing box for the
motor. We have slightly reworded the phrase “camouflaged” to make the
setup clearer.
Line 144 The distance travelled would also be relevant
In response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added the length of the
tracks to the legend of Figure 1, showing the experimental setup.
Line 148 “non-threatening” to the subject, the nest or both? If the passerine
could act even as a nuisance, e.g. stealing nesting material, would the
jackdaw enter the nest more quickly to defend this resource?
The small passerine species used as models in the study are not a danger to
jackdaws or jackdaw nests since they are insectivores during the breeding
season. Additionally, since jackdaws are more than ten times the size of the
smaller bird species, those birds would not naturally pester or aggravate a
larger corvid at a corvid nest. Due to these facts, we hypothesized at the outset
of the study that the bird stimuli should be non-threatening. However, as can
happen in science, our results unexpectedly revealed that there was something
about the small bird which elicited alarm calls at a higher rate than the stick
stimuli. In our many hundreds of hours of observations of these nest boxes
over the years, we have seen instances of small passerines landing on top of
nest boxes, but they have never been observed to enter. Importantly, in these
instances, the small passerines dart away as soon as a corvid approaches. The
fact that our bird stimuli did not leave the nest boxes when jackdaws
approached may have been the reason why the birds caused alarm (explained
on lines 320-324)
Line 149 “threatening” to the subject, the nest or both? Are jackdaws
predated upon by snakes? Would they mob a snake? If so, was this behaviour
observed?
A V. berus snake is unlikely to be threatening to an adult jackdaw, but their
nestlings would be vulnerable. We have added detail relating to the type of
threat in response to the reviewer’s questions (Line 162-163). We did not
observe physical mobbing in any of our experimental conditions, but we did
observe defensive alarm call scolding (which is now quantitatively analysed,
lines 243-251, 292-299). Our new analysis indicates that snakes were in fact
seen as more of a threat than sticks at the nest box.
Line 150 “implausible stimulus when moving”: sticks move but not in the
manner presented here; a stick moving in the wind or dropping from the trees
would be quite plausible
The reviewer here makes an excellent point, supporting why we chose our
stick to move in an unnatural way. Should we have moved the stick in natural
ways, such as the motion made in the wind or dropping from a tree, then the
movement would not suggest self-propelled animacy.
Line 153 “similar patterns” to the subjects or to the authors? The wild-type V.
berus has a clear zigzag pattern on its back, and while melanistic individuals
exist, their presence is more often in colder climates, e.g. Scandinavia, and
the model used does not have the distinct triangular head of V. berus
We do not know exactly how the birds perceive the snake patterns, since
detailed research into snake perception by jackdaws has not been done. That
being said, rubber snakes have successfully been used as model predators for
birds (including corvids) in the past (e.g. Gottfried 1979, Condor; Taylor
2012, Bio Letters; both now added as references, lines 161-162), and thus we
feel they represent a valid tool. In response the reviewer’s comment, we have
also clarified that the colour patterning we chose is more closely akin to the
male V. berus snake than the female (Legend for Figure 1 where patterns can
be clearly seen).
Line 156 Was there a particular reason why the Moving and Non-moving
trials for each stimuli type were done successively?
We chose to conduct the moving and non-moving trials successively to allow
for a comparison of behaviour as close in time as possible. This also meant
that if a nest failed mid-way through the study, then there would be a greater
likelihood that we would have a moving and non-moving stimulus pair.
Line 161-162 Is the nest visitation rate constant for this time period? Is nest
defence comparable over this time period?
The nest visitation rate and nest defence slowly change as the season
progresses. For this reason we counter-balanced the order of stimuli (snake,
bird and stick) to ensure that we were not overly sampling earlier or later
nesting stages with a particular stimulus type.
Line 166-167 How long did this swapping take?
Swapping took several minutes, which varied slightly depending upon the
difficulty of the ladder placement at each tree, but was similar within trials at
the same nest box.
Line 168 Exactly 2m or approximately? How was this assessed?
Each tree had a unique configuration of branches, which meant not all birds
could approach at exactly 2m, but the experimenter was able to assess which
branches fell within the 2m radius of the box prior to the beginning of the set
of trials, keeping the branch distinctions consistent across the 6 trials at that
tree. We have added a sentence explaining this measurement to the methods
(Line 181-183).
Line 169 How precise? At what distance could a jackdaw see the nest box?
Our measures were taken by the second (detail now added, line 178). The
maximum distance at which a jackdaw could see a nestbox differed depending
on the branching of the surrounding trees, but all nests within our study site
could be seen within a 2m radius of the nest box.
Line 171-172 After the first approach, would the jackdaw know there was an
object even if
obstructed?
Whenever a jackdaw approached, if the object was obstructed we did not
assume that the jackdaw would know it was there. Therefore we always
waited to trigger the motor until the bird reached the criteria for an approach:
i.e. coming within a 2m radius “from an angle where the stimulus would be
visible” (Line 180-181).
Line 172-173 The video and speed mentioned above suggests that a 10s
movement would include several directional changes. Was this constant? Did
some presentations have more or less changes in movement?
The reviewer is correct that several directional changes were included as part
of the trigger (hence the wording “back and forth”, lines 144, 149). Our
trigger presentation was kept constant between object types, and thus the
video is representative of the movement of all object types.
Line 174-176 Why was the stimulus retriggered for every approaching
jackdaw? This presumably resulted in a difference in the number of
presentations each focal individual was subjected to?
Yes, the stimulus was retriggered for every approach, so long as the bird went
out of view between approaches. As explained in relation to an earlier
comment, we have now provided detailed justification and evidence that the
number of stimulus triggers did not differ between conditions (Lines 185-186,
Table S1)
Line 180-182 Is it not “If at a nest box no jackdaw approached for two
consecutive trials”?
Yes, this is the meaning we were intended. We have edited the sentence for
clarity based on this suggestion.
Line 182-185 This is not clear: if the first bird to approach is the focal bird,
then how can a non-focal bird enter the nest box before the focal bird
approached? And how is the focal bird out of view: out of the experimenters
view? Not able to see the nest box? How was this determined?
The first bird to receive a trigger was defined as the focal bird, (i.e. the first to
approach within 2m, from an angle where the stimulus was visible). The focal
bird was not always the first bird to enter the nest box because there was the
odd occasion (14 trials out of 143, explained line 196-197) where a jackdaw
approached the nest box from an angle where the stimulus was not visible,
darting rapidly into the box, and not leaving enough time for a trigger. We
have added more detail about how the view point of the focal bird was
determined (Line 199).
Line 185-187 As the entering of the nest box by a non-focal was found to be a
significant factor in the analysis despite the low number of occurrences, I am
not sure that a mere similarity can warrant the inclusion of those trials. I also
question the validity of the “similarity”: at least one of the significant effects
is no longer significant after removal of those trials. Also: are the results for
the stick and snake reversed in the SI table? With the trials the snake is not
significant while the stick is, but without the trials the reverse is true.
Given the sample size of the study, it is not unexpected that some small
effects may change when a number of data points are removed. Additionally,
since single covariates are challenging to interpret when interactions involving
those covariates are present (as explained in Zuur et al., 2009), we did not
overly dwell on the change in the direction of these effects. Overall, the point
that we intended to make by removing the trials was that the main conclusion
that jackdaws’ latency to enter the nest box differed by stimulus and
movement, could still be drawn when these trials are removed.
Line 189-192 I would prefer this information already in the introduction when
the deviation from the lab parameters was first mentioned
Based on the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added detail to the introduction
to better explain why we used a different expectancy measurement. (Line 115-
116)
Line 196-197 Is the inclusion of any time not observed validated?
Unfortunately, we don’t quite understand what the reviewer meant by this
question, and thus have been unable to enact changes relating to this point.
Line 206-207 Why was the identity of the focal bird not entered as a random
factor?
We used nest-box as a random factor instead of individual bird since
differences in nest box placement and birds nesting within it would contribute
noise to the data. We realize now this was not mentioned in the main text, and
had only been described in the model selection process in the supplementary
material. We have now added this detail to the methods (Line 230), to help
clarify the model used.
Line 217-218 By trigger, is the first trigger the focal bird saw meant or the
last trigger presented to any bird approaching?
It was the first trigger. We have now added this detail to the methods.
Line 226-228 While the above description suggested one trial a day for 6
consecutive days, here it is stated that the three stimuli were presented on
three consecutive days, which in turn suggests that both the Moving and the
Non-Moving trials of each stimuli were done on the same day. If the
expectancy of movement is the main trigger (as has been argued) then should
there not be an analysis of the interaction between stimulus and order within
a stimulus pair?
There appears to be a slight misunderstanding based on our wording here. The
experiment was run so each Moving/Non-moving pair was run one day after
the other, with each pair being run consecutively. This equates to 6 total days
of experiments, not multiple presentations of the same stimuli on the same
day, hence there is no need for an additional interaction term. We have edited
the sentence to help clarify the setup (now on line 255). We would also like to
highlight that order within a stimulus pair, i.e. “within-pair-order”, as we
called it (Line 224), was part of the original analysis.
Line 254-256 This is an interpretation of the data and should be in the
discussion
We have removed the phrase in question from the Results section and added it
to the discussion.
Line 264-265 Two references is a bit meagre for a “widely” held assumption;
in addition in the introduction a paper is referenced where fish react to
motion in a predation context
We use the word “widely” here not to suggest that we are citing all literature
which holds this assumption, but instead to point readers towards literature
which discusses the social function of animacy distinctions as self-evident, as
supported by a broad literature base in those papers. In response to the
reviewer’s comment, we have added an additional review paper (ref [37]) to
that line to strengthen the case.
Line 267-269 This is far too speculative as it presupposes that the subjects
have movement
expectations for the stimuli, something that can not be shown with the data
here. It is a possibility, that this was the reason, but in no way the only one.
We used the ‘Violation of Expectancy’ paradigm to test the birds’ responses
to the different objects, a paradigm that is commonly used across many sub-
disciplines of animal cognition and developmental psychology to test whether
stimuli conform to the individual’s prior held associations about the world. As
explained above, “expectation” and “expectancy” are commonly used in the
animal cognition literature on animacy (see ref [5], plus Hauser, 1997, Dev
Sci), physical cognition (Vallortigara, et al., 2010, Wily Interdisciplinary
Reviews), and social cognition (Massen, et al, 2014, Nature) to test animals’
categories and abilities to distinguish between stimuli.
Line 269-271 The results suggest only that jackdaws differentiate between the
different stimuli used; why that is the case is another question entirely and
without the answer leaves any interpretation of the data beyond that as
speculative.
The sentence in question merely discusses the logical outcome of an
expectancy violation test when no difference appears between stimuli. In such
a case, when two stimuli do not differ in their propensity to violate
expectations, it suggests that the stimuli presentations are not unexpected (as
explained in more detail on lines 341-342).
Line 273-275 Is it surprising that only about a third of subjects were startled?
The reviewer’s comment indicates that our presentation of the startle response
data in our original submission was unclear because – contrary to the
reviewer’s suggestion - many more than a third of subjects were startled at the
trigger in Moving conditions. In response, we have now provided a table of
descriptive statistics (Table 1) and have edited the figure legend which shows
the effect of startling (Figure 2). We hope these additions will make it clearer
that a substantially greater proportion of birds startled in the moving versus
non-moving conditions (~57% versus 22%).
Line 277 “a heightened threat” is an assumption by the authors; novel stimuli
are treated as
potential threats, but the indication of a true heightened threat would require
evidence that the birds saw the stimuli as such.
In response to the reviewer’s comment, we have softened the wording of this
sentence so to suggest the stimuli are potential, not true known threats (now
Line 311). We have also introduced an entirely new line of analysis into the
paper, which specifically looks at defensive threat responses via the birds
scolding calls, and we now have evidence that the jackdaws perceive moving
stimuli as a threat and that sticks were less threatening than the snakes (Lines
306-307, 318-324)
Line 282-283 To what degree is this due to the flying away? Was there a large
enough proportion of jackdaws leaving that the startled category became
significantly different, while the other startle behaviours had little effect?
The additional analyses that we have now included on birds’ defensive
behaviors at the nest (i.e. their scolding calls) in response to some of Reviewer
#2’s concerns help shed light on this issue. We are now able to discern that
although moving conditions elicited more startle responses, they also elicited
more defensive scolding behaviors (lines 318-324), which means that the
jackdaws had to be present at the nest to engage in these behaviours, and thus
their overall nest entrance times were not likely due to just flying away.
Line 284 The term “inspect the stimulus” has been used, but what does it
mean? The experimenter was not, as mentioned, able to see the gaze of the
birds; did they interact with the stimulus?
While the experimenter was not able to precisely quantify inspection to the
level of accuracy needed for a looking time analysis, we were able to observe
that all birds returned to the nest, oriented their beak towards the stimulus,
moving their head back and forth, which is a corvid-typical inspection
behaviour. In response to the reviewer’s comment, we have added additional
detail to that sentence to better explain inspection (now Line 325-328).
Line 285-288 Could it not also be due to differences in contrast? The snakes
models would possibly stand out more on the platform even when not moving
than the sticks. Or that visually the snake model was more novel than the stick
but when movement comes into play both are similarly novel?
We have added additional discussion to this section of the paper about the role
of novelty as an explanation for the responses we documented (Lines 343-345,
365-371).
Line 290 or not novel
Unfortunately we have been unable to determine what the reviewer was
intending to suggest with this comment.
Line 290-291 Without an estimate of the size of each stimuli it is difficult to
evaluate the difference between the different reactions. If the non-moving
snake by virtue of greater contrast was more novel but the sticks when moving
presented more movement of area, then novelty and contrast could explain the
difference.
We have added a sentence to the caption to help better clarify the size of each
stimulus in relation to the standard track size we used. We would argue
strongly that size alone (by virtue of surface area) cannot explain the
difference in responses that we found because our two exemplars of the stick
and snake stimuli differed in size and shape (see Fig 1).
Line 292-294 Suggesting the possible question the subject is asking itself is
anthropomorphising, which is not necessary when describing behaviour here.
We have rephrased this sentence (now on Line 329-330) to make it more
objective.
Line 294-296 But could the neophobia not be an explanation for the delay in
entering the nest, without requiring a sense of animacy violation?
We have now added details to this paragraph to better explain the role of
novelty as an explanation for our results (Lines 343-345, 365-371).
Line 301-304 The results show that they react differently to the different
stimuli; any animacy expectation would still need to be shown
In response to the reviewer’s concern, we have softened our wording about
the ramifications of our results in this sentence.
Line 307-308 “in birds especially” is a weird comment to make about
imprinting when most (if not all) examples of filial imprinting come from birds
We included the word “especially” because most examples of filial imprinting
come from birds, and thus attending to movement has a very clear benefit for
them especially.
Line 308-312 Similar to the introduction, the connection between general
physical knowledge and animacy expectation is not well supported.
In response to the reviewer’s comment, we have now added a sentence (Line
360-361) to strengthen the connection between our results and the
development of physical cognition in non-imprinting birds.
Line 318 Unless they are upright
In response to the reviewer’s comment we have added additional detail to
clarify that stick movement, as we presented it (which was not upright), would
not occur naturally (now on line 367-368).
Line 321-323 True, but as neither can be suggested here, a further speculation
is not necessary
As part of our closing discussion, we lay out the potential hypotheses that
could explain our results, not to speculate on which one is correct, but to drive
future research into the mechanism underlying the effect we found. In this
section we are very clear in stating that we are not assuming one hypothesis
(e.g. “core knowledge” or prior associations) over another (Lines 374-378,
379)
Line 327-330 As it is not clear what caused the reactions by the subjects, it is
impossible to state where the observed behaviour plays any role in the wild,
and if it is an important role
Again, our closing statement is meant to place the results in a larger context
about what animacy categorizations could mean. We felt mentioning this
broader context was especially important for a non-specialist journal that
attracts readers from many disciplines. We have softened the wording in our
last sentence to emphasize that these are only potential effects at this stage
(now Line 379-384).

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_12
I found the manuscript very well written and tackling an interesting topic of
expectancy-violation of animacy in wild jackdaws. Especially the ecological
validity of the approach and conducting these experiments on free ranging
individuals are very strong points of this study.
Also, providing the full data set along with the R-code greatly enhanced
evaluation of the results and allowed to follow the analysis step by step.
We appreciate the positive comments from the author and are pleased that
they see the value of the study.
My main point of critique or concern with the data analysis and the
interpretation relates to discarding the possibility that jackdaws may exhibit a
pareidolic search image, leading to false positive responses to moving sticks.
We appreciate the reviewer’s concern and have addressed this issue where it is
brought up in the specific comments below.
In my opinion it is crucial to clearly discern jackdaws mistaking the moving
branch for a snake from the hypothesis put forth by the authors. It might be an
interesting addition to the current explanation. This could be achieved by
including a quantitative measure of ‘startle-’ or fear responses in the analysis.
If the extended time to enter the nest box in the moving stick condition is
indeed attributed to information gathering rather than fear, there should be
significant differences in subsets of groups (moving snake vs. moving stick).
We have now included an entirely new analysis on the birds’ defensive fear
responses at the nests (Lines 120-121, 213-216, 243-251, 291-299, 306-307,
338-340, Figure4, Table S4). By incorporating a measure of defensive calls
(i.e. “scolding” calls) at the nest, we have shed new light on the birds’
responses. Due to this new measure, it is now clear that the moving branch
was not classified the same way as the moving snake because a substantially
fewer number of birds scolded the stick than scolded the snake (lines 296-
297). We feel this additional measure helps clarify the relationship between
threats and information gathering.
Further, birds that have seen the snake model moving first might be primed to
evaluate moving branches as snakes, whereas this might not be the case for
bids that have seen moving branches first? Analysing the fear responses
and/or latency to enter the nestbox sequence of objects in more detail might
be telling.
While we agree with the reviewer that snake movement could in theory prime
responses to a moving stick, our existing analysis did include trial order in the
model, and it did not significantly improve the model fit (covariates listed
Line 224, model selection Table S2, S3 and S4). If we specifically compare
just the snake and stick trials, depending on trial order, we find no significant
difference between the entrance latencies between trials that had the stick first
(mean ±SE = 602 ± 77.5 seconds) and those that had the snake occur first
(mean ±SE = 664 ± 66.3 seconds). Therefore we do not feel that priming had
a significant influence on our results.
Overall, I think this is a study that would merit publication once it addresses
the issue raised above and smaller detailed issues below.
Again we thank the author for their praise of our study, and have responded to
their detailed comments below.
#####
Line 92-93: What about sit and wait predators such as some snakes?
In theory, one reason why sit and wait predators use such a tactic is because
movement is an easily detectable predatory cue. Thus while movement is not
the only predatory cue (and may not even be the most effective one at all
times), the existence of sit and wait predators actually helps demonstrate that
movement can be a predatory cue that predators may seek to avoid creating.
#####
Line 142-145: Is there a reason why a control condition for sound without any
additional stimuli has not been conducted?
Since all of our trials contained the same sound stimuli, we reasoned that any
difference in behaviour between them could not be attributed to the sound
itself. Thus since our setup only varied movement and object type, we did not
feel the need to add an extra control for sound only. Additionally since our
experiment was conducted on wild nests, for every condition we added, we
increased the likelihood that we would not be able to complete all trials at that
nest prior to the natural nest failure that occurs in many nests in our
population.
#####
Line 170: Could “scolding” or mobbing calls be taken as a quantitative
measure for analysis?
In light of the reviewer’s useful suggestion, we have now included a thorough,
quantitative analysis of scolding calls and have rewritten substantial portions
of the manuscript to explain, analyse and discuss the new results we found due
to including this measure (Lines 120-121, 213-216, 243-251, 291-299, 306-
307, 338-340, Figure4, Table S4). Overall we feel it has strengthened the
paper and our conclusions.
#####
Line 172-176: Therefore, if I understand correctly, some individuals were
exposed to longer/more movement of the stimuli. Since movement definitely
had an effect on the reaction to the stimulus it would be crucial to state
clearly if movement-exposure was the same for every bird. If this was not the
case, could this be factored in the analysis?
We responded to a similar concern by Reviewer 1. In summary, since not all
birds in our population were ringed (detail added lines 137-140), it was
impossible for us to rapidly decide which bird arrived in time to selectively
trigger when one bird of the pair approached. Instead, we ensured that every
arriving bird had the exact same stimulus experience during each arrival. Had
we not done so (i.e. had we only triggered it at the first arrival), we would
have increased the likelihood that the focal bird’s partner had a different
experience and thus different information about the stimulus. Additionally, for
a bird that arrived multiple times and saw multiple triggers, we could be sure
that they had in fact experienced the trigger before they decided to enter. We
have now added additional analysis to demonstrate that experimental
conditions did not differ in the number of times the motor was triggered. This
additional data summary is referenced on Lines 188-189, and a summary table
has been added to the electronic supplementary material (Table S1). We have
also updated the R code file to illustrate these calculations.

Line 192-194: Could this fear behaviour be factored in the analysis as a
quantitative measure to ensure delay in entering the nestbox in the stick
condition indeed reflected information gathering and not fear (e.g. mistaking
the stick for a moving snake)
The fear behaviour we reference in that line was used to determine whether
the bird startled or not, and the startle response (Y/N) was used as a factor in
the analysis. In light of the reviewer’s comment, we realize that our
description of this behaviour and its relation to the analysis could be clearer.
We have rephrased it (now Line 207-208) to avoid future confusion.
#####
Line 196: Could the authors provide the rationale for using the 20 min as cut-
off point? If this time was chosen arbitrarily it seems rather long, why not use
10 min? From plotting the histogram of latency to enter the nest box it seems
most entrances occurred within the first 500 sec. This would also strengthen
the argument that the delay would be related to the stimulus/trigger and not to
possibly other environmental factors.
Our prior work with jackdaws at their nest boxes during object neophobia
tests showed considerable individual variation, and a mean of 15.4 minutes
from approach to entrance a the nestbox. By rounding up to 20, we felt we had
a happy medium between allowing the maximum amount of time for birds to
enter without adversely affecting their chicks. We have now added a citation
to this dataset (citation [28]) and added wording to support our choice of trial
time (185-187).
#####
Lines 213-214: Why has this very conservative selection process been
applied?
There have been critiques of using an arbitrary change in AIC value of 2.0,
with some authors suggesting that larger changes are more meaningful
(Burnham and Anderson 2002). However, in light of the reviewer’s comments
and the more common usage of 2.0 as an AIC threshold, we have reverted
back to that threshold for our analysis. Doing so has not changed the
conclusions of the analysis that was included in the first submission of this
paper.
For me the full binomial model fails to reach conversion. I believe this is due
to the fact that this initial model contains too many factors for the sample size
(especially when including the interaction of movement with stimulus). This
might be a minor issue as the way around is to focus on the relevant factors,
which occurs naturally in the model selection process, but on the other hand it
might lead to kicking out said interaction prematurely?
The reviewer is right that the sample size limits the ability of the model to
converge when so many factors are included. After plotting the raw data
(Figure 2) and going through the model selection process, we did not see
support for an interaction effect. If we go back and add the interaction at the
end of the model selection process, as the reviewer suggests, the model’s AIC
value increases by 1.4 (and inclusion would be warranted by a decrease >2).
Therefore we feel that our removal of the interaction effect at the early stages
of the model selection process did not influence our conclusion that there was
no interaction.
#####
Lines 268-271: An alternative hypothesis might be that individuals have a
search image for long moving items which are categorised as snakes and
therefore elicit fear. It might be able to tease this hypothesis apart from the
argument the authors put forth by looking more closely at a quantitative
measure of fear responses in the stick vs. snake condition
The new analysis on scolding behaviour that we have included in our revised
manuscript shows a significant difference between snakes and sticks in the
amount of defensive behaviour they elicited (Lines 292-299). Therefore we
our data suggest that the moving sticks are not categorized as snakes and that
search images for long moving items cannot explain the expectancy violations
we found in the moving-stick condition.
#####
Line 284-285: Time to enter nest box as information gathering? Why not fear
response as argued in the lines above?
With the addition of the new line of analysis on scolding responses, the
discussion has changed considerably and the sentence which the reviewer
commented has now been edited such that this comment is no longer
immediately relevant. That being said, the relationship between fear responses
and information gathering has now been clarified via the inclusion of this
additional analysis.

Figure 2: Illustration of ‘startle’ reactions to trigger not easily intelligible
We chose to represent the data in ratios because the analysis processes the
data as ratios. We have added a line in the figure legend to make the figure
easier to read and understand.

I get different values for Table S2:

StimulusSnake -0.18364 0.83223 0.33291 0.32489 -0.565 0.5719
StimulusStick 0.50851 1.66282 0.33853 0.28475 1.786 0.0741 .
We appreciate the reviewer going through in detail the code we provided. We
have double checked the results tables, and when we run the code listed in the
submission files, we still get the original values listed in Table S2 (now
labelled as Table S3, screen grab provided below). We have found that if the
R environment was not properly cleared before portions of the code were run,
then different results could appear. We have added a line to the code to clear
the user’s R environment prior to running our code and reload the original
data file prior to this section of code.

Both Reviewers agree that your manuscript has greatly strengthened. It is
heartening to read a review in which differences of perspective are allowed
within the literature! Well done for a terrific revision. Each Reviewer has
made suggestions for small revision. These need not be re-reviewed, but you
may want to consider the suggestions and act on them. They are light of touch.
Lastly, I should like to say that I regret your very long wait for a decision. I
have been away from work for a couple of months because of some adverse
family events. I advised the journal, but Authors awaiting manuscript decision
like you, have rather suffered. I look forward to seeing this paper in RSOS.
Thank you very much for the encouraging comments. We are thrilled that the
manuscript has been accepted pending minor revisions, and we have
addressed the minor reviewer comments below.

I found the manuscript greatly improved by the additional analysis and toned
down wording.
The authors clearly have put much effort into addressing all of the reviewers
comments and revised the previous version by phrasing their methods and
discussion much more clearly.
One minor issue I would still like to see discussed is the fact that the
motionless stick apparently (Fig.2) elicited the same amount of (low) startle
as the motionless snake.
Otherwise, I have no further comments and believe this manuscript is ready
for publication.
We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s consideration of our manuscript and their
positive comments. We have added explanation of the startle responses in the
non-moving conditions (line 315-318). Although the snake and stick levels
look very similar to each other, statistically all three stimuli types elicited
similar levels of startle responses with the moving versus non-moving
conditions. For approaching jackdaws in non-moving conditions, there was no
sudden change to the object on their nest box at the exact time of the trigger,
and so the likelihood of them startling at that moment was low. The low levels
of startling that we saw across all trials may have therefore been due to the
sound of the motor which was common across all stimuli. Longer term
assessments of the stick and snake, such as their delay in entering their nest
box and the number of alarm calls, seem to serve as better comparisons of
their fear responses towards the snake versus stick than non-moving startle
responses do.

First of all, I think that the manuscript has improved and I am much more in
agreement with how you have worded the text than before. I am still not 100%
convinced that the subjects reacted to expectation violations, rather than just
novelty (I disagree with your response to my comment that reaction to novelty
requires an expectation violation to occur, but this seems to be more of a
theoretical discussion rather than one that can be backed up by the current
literature, and thus does not warrant rejection of your interpretation).
Aside from the smaller comments I would ask that you consider adding in
definitions for "categorisation" and "expectation" as the terms used in the text
are common in that field, but have slightly different meanings in others, and,
as you have stated yourself, this journal is for a broader audience. It will
allow the average reader to better follow exactly what you mean when using
these terms.
We thank the reviewer for their balanced assessment of our response and for
their suggestion. We have added brief definitions for categorisation and
expectation when they each first arise in the main text (Line 55, 63).
