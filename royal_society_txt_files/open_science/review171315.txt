The authors have written a comprehensive review in the area of liquid phase catalysis using
metallosilicates focusing on specific examples including synthesis of materials, characterisation,
catalytic applications, structure-activity relationships and one of the most important topics in
catalysis which is deactivation and long term stability. There is a good balance of the different
sections presented, with a good number of clear figures. Few typos are presented in the
manuscript in the main text and references.

referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

To: Dr. Siobhán Hackett, Publishing Editor
Dear Dr. Hackett,
Please find enclosed our revised manuscript, titled “Porous metallosilicates for heterogeneous, liquid-
phase catalysis: perspectives and pertaining challenges,” for prospective publication in Royal Society
Open Science (Manuscript ID: RSOS-171315). We were delighted to read that both referees
recommended publication of the article, and had only very minor comments to make on the submission.
As you will see below, we have commented on the very minor points raised by the referees, and do hope
this makes the manuscript suitable for publication. For ease of evaluation, any additions to the text have
been highlighted in yellow, and are described in depth in the “Response to Reviewer Reports” section
below.
We look forward to your reply,

Comments to the Author
Metallosilicates have emerged as uniquely active catalysts for a In the review paper, the a variety of
liquid phase catalytic transformations. The authors made a systematic summary for existing challenges.
Although the review looks comprehensive, there are a number of critical concerns to be addressed in
this work.
1. It will be better to understand the future of the porous metallosilcates catalysis applications if more
perspectives description is provided.
Response: Unfortunately, we regret we are not prepared to add further perspectives to the manuscript,
as that section already accounts for 18 pages of the manuscript, which is greater than 50 % of the text.
Increasing this further would, in our opinion, unbalance the review, and not provide us with sufficient
text with which to highlight the unique chemistry exhibited by these materials in section 2 – the state of
the art applications section.
2. Tables of the articles summary for the catalysis applications of the porous metallosilicates for
heterogeneous, liquid-phase catalysis are suggested to be provided.
Response: Unfortunately, it is not clear what this comment means, and so no further action has been
taken.
3. The references cited in the Figures should be pointed out the “Reproduced with permission from
reference XX.”
Response: As suggested by the referee, we have added the statement to those references that have
been reproduced or adapted from previous works.
4. Page 19, “in our studies, a combination of mechanochemical and……”, the reference need to be
showed.
Response: The reference to this was placed in inappropriately placed in the following sentence, and has
now been moved to the end of the initial sentence as suggested by the referee. We thank them for
noticing this small error in the original submission.
5. It’s better to use the same format for all the Figures. For example, Figure 15 used “left”, “right” and
Figure 16 used the “A, B, C”.
Response: As suggested by the referee, we have added a uniform format to all composite figures.
Specifically, this only related to Figure 16, which has now been changed from A, B and C to Top Left,
Right and Bottom Left, respectively. We thank them for noticing this small error in the original
submission.
6. The reference format needs to be unified.
Response: In line with the referees suggestion, we identified a handful of references that were formatted
slightly differently, and have corrected these as appropriate. This was mostly the absence of the final
page number in a handful of references, or abbreviations of the journal name instead of the full journal
name. However, we thank them for noticing this issue in the original submission.
