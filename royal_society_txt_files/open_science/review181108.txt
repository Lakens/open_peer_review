In this manuscript, Barreto et al. tried to achieve a magnetoliposome that can be applied for
electric and luminous signal transmission. There are some points that need further clarification
and improvement:
1. The characterization of magnetite-containing PC/CL liposomes is not sufficient. The authors
conducted zeta potential and DLS measurements to validate the encapsulation of magnetite into
liposomes, but the interpretation of the results are ambiguous. The two different <U+03C2> values (-54.5
and -24.3 mV) for Fe3O4/PC/CL could possibly result from a heterogeneous mixture of
magnetite nanoparticles and liposomes. The statement “two population of magnetic
nanoparticles” are unfounded because the DLS result exhibits only one size (285nm) for
Fe3O4/PC/CL. Nonetheless, the FTIR measurements could not provide solid evidence for
encapsulation of magnetite either, because a simple mixture of magnetite suspension and PC/CL
solution is likely to show the same spectra. It seems that the transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) can be the only reliable technique to validate the formation of magnetite-encapsulated
PC/CL liposomes. So TEM experiment is mandatory here.
2. In the section “Delivery of magnetic nanoparticles to GUVs”, there is a description “Figure 5
shows that in the GUV population with diameters of 2 to 4 µm larger radius were not the unique
factor that contributed to increasing velocity” which is not appropriate. The radius (R) is
inversely proportional to the velocity (u), which is revealed by Eq. 1. Moreover, the increase of
radius would enhance the drag force and consequently reduce the velocity. Thus, in no way
could larger radius contribute to increasing velocity.
3. The first two sentences of section “Application of magnetic mobility” are not quite relevant
with the magneto electrochemisty and luminous transmission properties. Instead, they should
belong with the former section concerning dynamic equilibrium between forces.
4. There is mistake in caption of Fig. 6. I suppose the “gray line” and “black line” should be
“green line” and “red line”. Moreover, the insets of cyclic voltammograms are not annotated,
neither were they explained in the main text. Readers may be confused about what these graphs
mean and how they are derived.
5. In the final part that studies the luminescent signal transmission, the LUVs containing
magnetite was firstly introduced and transferred into a capillary tube, but they were not
subjected to further signal transmission experiments. Why would the authors mention the LUVs
here at all?
6. The device for testing the luminescent signal transmission is not clearly illustrated, and it is
hard to imagine how the experimental result can lead to conclusion that signal transmission was
realized by magnetite containing GUVs. Judging from the authors’ response to the previous
reviewer 1, the GUVs loaded with magnetite can be transported along the capillary to the
extremity connected to the optical fiber driven by magnetophoresis. Whereas the authors still did
not make it clear in the main article and the results are still difficult to understand. Maybe
another illustrative scheme should be presented here.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Reviewer 1 comment - In this manuscript, Barreto et al. tried to achieve
a magnetoliposome that can be applied for electric and luminous signal
transmission. There are some points that need further clarification and
improvement:
1. The characterization of magnetite-containing PC/CL liposomes is not
sufficient. The authors conducted zeta potential and DLS measurements
to validate the encapsulation of magnetite into liposomes, but the
interpretation of the results is ambiguous. The two different <U+03C2> values (-
54.5 and -24.3 mV) for Fe3O4/PC/CL could possibly result from a
heterogeneous mixture of magnetite nanoparticles and liposomes. The
statement “two population of magnetic nanoparticles” are unfounded
because the DLS result exhibits only one size (285 nm) for Fe3O4/PC/CL.
Nonetheless, the FTIR measurements could not provide solid evidence for
encapsulation of magnetite either, because a simple mixture of magnetite
suspension and PC/CL solution is likely to show the same spectra. It
seems that the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can be the only
reliable technique to validate the formation of magnetite-encapsulated
PC/CL liposomes. So TEM experiment is mandatory here.
Response: We performed additional experiments to corroborate the
encapsulation of magnetite by the lipids that are depicted below. However,
GUVs loaded with magnetite was the conductor of luminous signal,
Therefore, we changed the title to Magnetoliposomes as Model for Signal
Transmission because it is more objective and summarizes the principal
objective of the present study. Below reviewer 1 can find our argumentation
about the encapsulation of magnetite by the lipids:
<U+F0B7> DLS and zeta potential measurements
The size obtained by DLS is a mean size and not only one size. The mean
size should be considered together the polydispersity index that was
measured as 0.46. The reviewer is right and the mention to two population
of magnetic nanoparticles is not correct. In the re-revised version of the
manuscript, the correct interpretation of the data is presented. The DLS
measurement is presented as a weighted average. The value of 285 nm
that was reported for Fe3O4/PC/CL does not means that all the
nanostructures have this size. The value of 285 nm is the weighted average
of a population (Gaussian distribution) of 350 nm that was 75% of the
total nanostructures and a population of 90 nm that was 25% of the total
nanostructures. In this regard, the population with zeta potential of -24
mV corresponded also to 75% of the total. Considering that the zeta
potential of -54.5 mV is almost the same of PC/CL liposomes (-55 mV)
one can conclude that the sample contained two population, one
population of a supramolecular aggregate of lipid-encapsulated magnetite
and PC/CL liposomes that were not associated to magnetic particles. In
this condition, most of the lipid that was added for magnetite hydration
became composing the Fe3O4/PC/CL structures and reminiscent lipids
formed smaller empty liposomes. The abovementioned details are
included in the re-revised version of the manuscript. In addition, we
repeated the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles and the fabrication of
encapsulated liposomes using the same methods described in the
manuscript. The zeta potential of this new sample was measured as -22
mV corresponding to 78% of the total population. Therefore, the results
described in the manuscript are reproducible and confident.
<U+F0B7> FTIR spectroscopy
Regarding the statement of the reviewer 1 that “the FTIR measurements
could not provide solid evidence for encapsulation of magnetite either,
because a simple mixture of magnetite suspension and PC/CL solution is
likely to show the same spectra”, can be rebutted because the for FTIR
analysis, the magnetic material was separated from nonmagnetic
liposomes using a magnet. Therefore, the number of free liposomes that
could be present in the sample measured by vibrational spectroscopy
should be negligible and not consistent with the significant FTIR signals
of lipids that were obtained. In addition, we included snapshots of
temporal magnetophoretic movement of magnetite in aqueous suspension
and covered by lipids that were included as insets of Fig. 3A. It was clear
that the encapsulation delays the movement of the nanoparticles.
<U+F0B7> TEM
Regarding TEM experiment that the reviewer said to be mandatory here,
we explain that only cryoTEM could provide a realistic image of the
magnetite-encapsulated liposomes.
The cryoTEM equipment that we have access to is a multiuser facility
whose use is linked exclusively to previously approved objectives of a
research project. We had a single date available for use in the month of
October 2018, but that use was scheduled for the analysis of samples
related to another project. We requested the exchange of the planned
experiment, but this request was denied by the responsible for the facility.
Thus, to better answer the questions of the reviewer, we opted for an
alternative analysis that was FESEM EDX. Although this technique does
not allow us to obtain a realistic image of the liposome structure, since the
drying of the sample causes the liposomes to collapse, the results
presented in the elemental maps (here included as Figure 3B) showed that
oxygen map density is greater than the iron map density. Since oxygen is
present in the head of the phospholipid molecules and in the crystalline
structure of the magnetite, the EDX elemental maps are consistent with
magnetite encapsulated by a lipid layer or bilayer. Furthermore, carbon
map was coincident with those of oxygen and iron.
In summary, the evidences of magnetite encapsulated by lipids (magnetic
LUVs) are reinforced by: i) increase in the mean diameter relative to bare
magnetite; ii) change of zeta potential to less negative values that is
consistent with the covering by a lipid composition containing 80% of
zwitterionic lipids; iii) capacity of magnetite hydrated in the presence of
lipids to load GUVs with magnetite contrary to the bare magnetite that
remained out of these vesicles and did not provide magnetophoretic
property for GUVs (see Fig. 1S); iv) FTIR spectra and EDX maps
consistent with magnetite covered by lipids.
2. In the section “Delivery of magnetic nanoparticles to GUVs”, there is
a description “Figure 5 shows that in the GUV population with diameters
of 2 to 4 µm larger radius were not the unique factor that contributed to
increasing velocity” which is not appropriate. The radius (R) is inversely
proportional to the velocity (u), which is revealed by Eq. 1. Moreover,
the increase of radius would enhance the drag force and consequently
reduce the velocity. Thus, in no way could larger radius contribute to
increasing velocity.
Response: The reviewer is correct that according to Eq.1 the radius is
inversely proportional to the velocity; therefore, one would expect as
suggested that the larger radius would have reduced velocity. However,
in these experimental conditions, larger GUVs are loaded with higher
amount of magnetite, which allows for an increased magnetic force.
With a higher magnetic force, the drag force would increase
correspondingly, allowing to have higher velocities. Part of the
paragraph might not have been so clear; therefore, we re-wrote it to
convey a clearer message, from "However, Fig. 5A shows a change of the curve
slope linear by increasing GUV radius. Considering that effective dynamic viscosity is
constant, the slope changes showed in Fig. 5 indicate that GUV populations with a
diameter in the range of 2 to 4 µm move at almost twice the speed of those with a
radius ranging from 1.1 to 1.6 µm. Larger GUVs can fuse with more magnet-LUVs and
consequently accumulate more magnetite. Therefore, Figure 5 shows that in the GUV
population with diameters of 2 to 4 µm larger radius were not the unique factor that
contributed to increasing velocity. In these population, a higher magnetite cargo
contributed synergistically to increasing velocity", to " However, Fig. 5A indicates an
increased slope for larger GUV radius. An increased slop according to Eq.1 indicates a
larger velocity, which sounds counterintuitive, if one assumes that the magnetite
content inside different sized GUVs is unchanged. However, it is expected that larger
GUVs could be loaded with a higher amount of magnetite, therefore increasing the
effective magnetic moment of the bigger GUVs. As a result, a higher magnetic
attraction is experienced under the external gradient of the magnetic field by the larger
GUVs with a corresponding higher drag force. This increased drag force results in an
increased velocity for bigger GUVs as indicated by the experimental data in Fig. 5A."
3. The first two sentences of section “Application of magnetic mobility”
are not quite relevant with the magneto electrochemistry and luminous
transmission properties. Instead, they should belong with the former
section concerning dynamic equilibrium between forces.
Response: The recommended change was addressed in the re-revised
version of the manuscript.
4. There is mistake in caption of Fig. 6. I suppose the “gray line” and
“black line” should be “green line” and “red line”. Moreover, the insets of
cyclic voltammograms are not annotated, neither were they explained in
the main text. Readers may be confused about what these graphs mean
and how they are derived.
Response: The pertinent corrections were done in the caption and in the
description of the figure in the main text as depicted below.
Revised text
“Figure 6A shows the cyclic voltammograms of the Fe3O4-CTAB-Fc obtained at 100 mV
s-1 using “switch off” (red line) and “switch on” (green line) modes, respectively. Also,
in Figure 6, the grey line corresponds to the voltammogram of ferrocene associated with
CTAB micelles (control condition). The insets show the anodic (jpa) and cathodic (jpc)
peaks as a function of the scan rates1/2 obtained in the “switch off” (red points) and
“switch on” (green points) modes, respectively. A possible organization of Fe3O4-CTAB-
Fc is shown in the scheme of the magneto electrochemistry configuration (Figure 6B).”

Fc is shown in the scheme of the magneto electrochemistry configuration.
5. In the final part that studies the luminescent signal transmission, the
LUVs containing magnetite was firstly introduced and transferred into a
capillary tube, but they were not subjected to further signal transmission
experiments. Why would the authors mention the LUVs here at all?
Response: We intended to reinforce that the loading of GUVs with
magnetite and fluorophores provided by LUVs could be controlled by
using a magnet. However, this description was not necessary and lacked
clarity. Therefore, we presented the experiment in a more objective
description in the re-revised version of the manuscript.
“Also, luminous signals can become switchable and increased by magnetophoresis. In
this set of experiments, magnetite-loaded LUVs associated with MC540 were used to
deliver magnetite and the fluorophore to GUVs as described before. The suspension, i.e.,
magnetite-loaded GUVs, was transferred to a capillary tube…”
6. The device for testing the luminescent signal transmission is not clearly
illustrated, and it is hard to imagine how the experimental result can lead
to conclusion that signal transmission was realized by magnetite
containing GUVs. Judging from the authors’ response to the previous
reviewer 1, the GUVs loaded with magnetite can be transported along the
capillary to the extremity connected to the optical fiber driven by
magnetophoresis. Whereas the authors still did not make it clear in the
main article and the results are still difficult to understand. Maybe another
illustrative scheme should be presented here.
Response: The reviewer is right since it is difficult a complete
visualization of the experiment only by the narrates presented in the text.
Therefore, we associated snapshots with a new scheme to facilitate the
visualization that are in a new version of Fig. 7A in the re-revised version
of the manuscript.
Reviewer: 2
Reviewer 2 comment - The authors made a detailed response to the
reviewer comments of first round. however, some responses did not
answer directly to the comments. for example, why start from LUV to
GUV, the answer is not convincing. Reviewer 2, comment 2, the response
is very simple, the authors need to provide details of how they addressed
the comments, not only simply stating that "made efforts to avoid
ambiguity”. also, please highlight the revisions in your text, the reviewers
are not going to search the revision from the text.
Response: To address the comments of reviewer 2, we provided now a
copy of the manuscript in which the changes are highlighted in yellow.
Also, we cite bellow, the most relevant changes that were made in the
first-round revised version of the manuscript. Other changes refer to text
format.
1. The title was changed. The new title is more objective and
consistent with the principal objective of the present study:
Magnetoliposomes as Model for Signal Transmission. In the previous
version to address the pertinent criticism, SUV was replaced by
LUV throughout the text.
2. We included details about zeta potential measurements.
3. The text about magnetophoresis was changed for clarity.
4. We included a description about the production of
magnetite/CTAB system.
We did not state only that "we made efforts to avoid ambiguity”. In the
first round, Reviewer 2 wrote: This lack of clarity is not helped by the
ambiguity in literature concerning the term “magnetoliposome”, as in
some cases this refers to liposomes (such as GUVs, LUVs) associated with
MNPs and in others it refers to MNPs coated with lipid. In either case,
there have been plenty of researchers in both these fields and suggested
some reviews in Preiss et al. Expert Opin. Drug Deliv., 2011, 8, 1025–
1040 and Monnier et al. Eur. J. Nanomed. 2014, 6, 201–215), to be
included in reference 10 that were addressed in the revised version of the
manucript. We also answered: Considering the pertinent questions raised
by reviewer 2, we revised the terminology to avoid ambiguity and justified
the choice of lipid structure names. In fact, the diameter values obtained
by DLS are consistent with LUVs, and this correction was done in the
revised version of the manuscript. Lipid-covered magnetite was replaced
by PC/CL- and LUV-encapsulated magnetite since that the reviewer is
right when raise the question that some kind of encapsulated volume
should exist.
Regarding the question why start from LUV to GUV, we can explain that
this is a strategy to create an intermediate in the communicating system.
As an example, the creation of successive steps in a system allows, among
other constructions, the fabrication of chemical systems that can be used
to execute Boolean logic operations. This type of system could be used,
among other constructions, for the fabrication of chemical systems that
can be used to execute Boolean logic operations. An example is described
in the paper by Liu et al. (ref. 40 in the revised version of the manuscript),
in which the authors show a system with gold nanoparticles coated by a
photosensitive molecule that isomerizes under UV light and gains affinity
for copper ions. In that system, the authors have a binary code 0-0 when
the dispersed gold nanoparticles coated by the photosensitive molecule are
in a solution free of copper ions and not under UV irradiation. The
irradiation of the copper-free solution generates the 1-0 code represented
by the dispersed nanoparticles coated by the UV-isomerized molecules.
The addition of copper ions in the solution but not under UV light
constitutes the code 0-1, since the nanoparticles remain dispersed. Finally,
with the simultaneous presence of UV light and copper ions constitutes
the code 1-1, a condition in which the gold nanoparticles aggregate
(detectable by the change of suspension color) through the copper ion-
mediated nanoparticle connections. The system described in the present
study can be applied in a similar way. LUVs without magnetite and a
fluorophore added to a suspension of GUVs constitute the 0-0 code, since
fusion occurs but this is not detectable by the fact that GUVs do not gain
fluorescence and magnetophoretic property. LUVs associated with a
fluorophore, but without magnetite, make the GUVs fluorescent but the
signal cannot be transmitted at a distance and this condition represents the
1-0 code. The fluorophore-free LUVs loaded with magnetite fuses with
the GUVs and give them the magnetophoretic property but not luminous
signal to be transmitted and this condition constitutes the code 0-1. Only
LUVs with fluorophore and magnetite render GUVs fluorescent and
owned of magnetophoretic property and this condition constitute the code
1-1. These considerations were included in the revised version of the
manuscript. Anyway, it is necessary a vehicle to load GUVs with
magnetite since the electroformation of GUVs is impaired in the presence
of magnetite.
