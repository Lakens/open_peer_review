In general, I found this to be an interesting paper that is well organised, clear and with some
novel approaches to understanding the influence of muscle mechanics on jumping performance.
There is yet to be a consistent consensus about why countermovement jumps (CMJ) outperform
squat jumps (SJ): some of this is addressed in this paper. The approach taken here was to examine
how some of the prime power producing muscles operate in vivo and compare this to
measurements of the force generating potential of the muscle at different lengths/velocities. This
is nice approach. However, I feel that there some major bits of information that are missing from
this paper that make the conclusions quite fraught with danger.
Firstly, a major premise behind the study is that CMJ generates greater mean power output (and
hence work) than the SJ. This must be the case for one jump to be higher than the other, however
the authors presume that this means that the quadriceps muscles must also generate more power,
neglecting potential differences in joint contributions. Consider that it is possible that all of the
extra power comes from the ankle or hip – the later has been suggested and shown by Fukashiro
& Komi (Int J Sports Med, 1987). This would mean that the quadriceps muscles, including VL,
might be generating very similar average power and work in the two jumps (even if this
performed in a different manner). Therefore, I believe that the authors need to perform
calculations of the knee power and work generated (considering both negative and positive
phases) to be able to make any conclusions about the power generating potential of the VL
during this task and how this influences performance.
3
Secondly, the paper relies heavily on estimated values of the force-velocity and hence power-
velocity relationship for this muscle and I believe they may be drastically overestimating the
maximum shortening velocity of the VL muscle. As such I believe that the conclusions where the
muscle operates on its power curve are far too sensitive to unknown parameters of the force-
velocity curve. I have elaborated on this below, but I believe this part of the paper needs to be
removed, because it is too speculative and dependent on the values chosen.
While the result that there is a higher average and peak velocity in the CMJ will still remain (and
hence there must be a drop overall force potential due this) regardless of the estimates used, the
interpretation of the potential for greater power production could be drastically overestimated.
The authors have used some literature estimations of the maximum shortening velocity (11.85
Lo/s) from a modelling / simulation study which has very little biological support. The authors
address this briefly in the discussion, however they suggest that their results would not be
affected unless the maximum velocity was less than 5.57Lo/S. It is not clear why this value was
chosen (is it the maximum shortening measured?), however if this value were the Vmax then this
would shift the ‘average’ shortening velocities for both CMJ and SJ towards the optimum of the
power curve and this may change the authors conclusions about the power generating potential
of the VL muscle. Estimates for VL Vmax from skinned fibres would predict temperature
dependent maximum shortening velocities between 5-15 Lo/s, depending on fibre type
contributions and the Q10 value used (and whether these fibres can indeed shorten
independently). This is a broad range of possibilities and probably does not help a lot in this case,
except to say there is large uncertainty when scaling these types of measures to the whole muscle.
The only other study that has investigated shortening dependent behaviour of the VL uses
similar ultrasound technology to the present study – the study by Fontana et al (2014) cited in the
discussion. While the authors suggest that this study predicts a maximum shortening velocity
above 5.57 Lo/s, I had a look at this data and believe that Vmax is probably only a little over this
value. In fact, if you convert the fascicle based curve from their figure 5 to a power curve, the
peak power occurs at around 2 Lo/s (their highest velocity). This is siginifcantly lower than the
peak power based on the hypothetical curves proposed by the authors here (approximately
3.9Lo/s) and could modify the conclusions that there is a power generating advantage in the CMJ
or even make this result more strong. Therefore, I believe the authors either need to conduct a
study similar to the Fontana study, or find a better way to justify their selection of Vmax and the
appropriate curvature of the F-V curve.
Specific Comments
L83-90 – Can you provide in indication of what proportion of the total positive work is done at
the knee (by the extensors)? I am not quite sure this is the major power producer.
L103-105 – “To the best of our knowledge, the fascicle behaviour, operating length and
shortening velocity of the vastii muscles during SJ and CMJ in vivo have not been investigated
yet.” While this is a correct statement, I believe the authors have neglected the nice work from
Finni et al, 2000 (EJAP) and Finni et al 2003 (Acta Physiologica), where many of these measures
were conducted during these jumps (although no direct comparison of vasti muscles were made).
These results are obviously pertinent in the current study and should be discussed in the
introduction/discussion.
L224-230 – Is 43 frames per second sufficient to measure peak shortening velocities during a
dynamic task like jumping? How many frames are taken per upwards movement in the jumps?
L258-265 – Why not determine the average operating length, as this is likely to provide an
‘average force potential’? This is what was done for the velocity data.
Fig 4/5 – Where have force/power estimates (y-axis values) on Figures 4/5 come from? Are these
estimates directly from the curve, or estimates based on the forces measured during the jumps?
Or have you just taken the velocity values and recalculated what the force value must be for that
axis?
L270-274 – I believe that if Vmax was lower, then the fascicle velocities for both jumps would sit
closer to the optimum for power production. I am not sure if there would be a clear difference in
4
the resulting power potential. However, it has to be acknowledged that during these jumps there
may not be an increase in the work / average force / power at the knee (driven by the quadriceps
muscles) – this is why these measurements need to be made to support the conclusions.
L283-287 – The fact that there was an increase in activation is not given any extra context, for
instance is there also an increase in the force (or surrogate knee moment)?
Further discussion point - There is also evidence that the force-velocity and force-length
relationships are not consistent across activations – i.e. submaximal activation see a rightward
shift of the force-length relationship and a reduction in maximum shortening velocity. This
should be mentioned as a limitation of the approach where maximum isometric testing is used.
The authors should also discuss that there are numerous other power producing muscles that
contribute and that could also be assessed in a similar manner to the methods produced here. For
instance, I believe the ankle produces more than 50% of the total positive work for a vertical jump
and hence the plantar flexors may show similar relationships to the knee extensors.

While both reviewers praise the interesting question and overall approach undertaken in this
study, they raise concerns about the specific assumptions, methods and analysis approaches
used, which will require major revisions to address. In particular, the authors should ensure that
the revisions fully address the questions about the validity of measurements and demonstrate
that the results and conclusions are supported by the data in light of sources of error and
methodological limitations.

I believe that the authors have improved their manuscript and have now provided a robust
scientific argument and therefore believe that this nice paper should be published. I am
particularly impressed that the authors have included the inverse dynamics calculations, which I
think strengthen their argument enormously.
I have a few minor comments that I believe will improve the paper –
L437-463. I appreciate the authors deep explanation to support their power calculations and
estimates of Vmax. I agree with them that their estimates are reasonable, at least to a tolerance
where the interpretation shouldn’t change. However, this paragraph has become very long. I
would suggest removing L457-452, as these estimates are really back of the envelope calculations.
I also think that you need to consider whether you are suggesting that sub-maximal activation
from the Fontana et al study would be likely to reduce the maximum shortening velocity, rather
than just the maximum force. In studies of human muscle, there is some evidence that
submaximal activation causes a reduction in the perceived Vmax, however in isolated muscle
preparations do not often show this relationship. In a recent really nice paper by Holt
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2014.0002), it was shown that submaximal activation does
reduce Vmax, but this isn’t a simple function of fibre type recruitment and they suggest that
compliance and the requirement to accelerate the muscle mass (also explored by Ross and
Wakeling DOI: 10.1098/rsbl.2015.1041). I think that things get a little complicated for you to be
able to just shift the F-v curve so that Vmax is ~30% higher when activation is 30% higher (i.e. 70
to 100%) – as was done in the figure in the response document My suggestion would be this – to
just say that the Fontana paper estimates a lower value of Vmax than used in your model, but
that this was potentially done at submaximal activation levels (~70%) and that this might reduce
the predicted maximum shortening velocity (citing, for instance, the Holt paper). Then just say
that regardless, the estimated Pmax value would still be higher than the values reported in this
study and hence your conclusions should still be valid in this range.
Please also reword the following sentence -
‘This means that the lowest threshold of the VL Vmax that could affect our results would be a
Vmax that, according to Hill, its 33% is 1.84 L0/s (i.e. Vmax=5.57 L0/s).’
to read –
‘This means that the lowest threshold of the VL Vmax that could affect our results would be
Vmax=5.57 L0/s, assuming an approximate peak power at 33% of Vmax (insert Hill reference),
which must be greater than 1.84 L0/s.’
Note that the 33% is not a given, it is an approximate estimate – this value depends very much on
the curvature of the F-v relationship which is fibre type dependent.
Figure 4 & 5 – I appreciate the changes in the text of the figure to better explain what the points
on the graph mean, however, it is still very confusing, especially because the points don’t actually
sit on the curves. I would suggest using shaded areas that go from the lines of each curve fit
down to the x-axis, with the width of the line representing the range in the lengths or velocities
9
for each measurement. This would better imply that the force level may be any region below the
curve.

which must be greater than 1.84 L0/s.’
Note that the 33% is not a given, it is an approximate estimate – this value depends very much on
the curvature of the F-v relationship which is fibre type dependent.
Figure 4 & 5 – I appreciate the changes in the text of the figure to better explain what the points
on the graph mean, however, it is still very confusing, especially because the points don’t actually
sit on the curves. I would suggest using shaded areas that go from the lines of each curve fit
down to the x-axis, with the width of the line representing the range in the lengths or velocities
for each measurement. This would better imply that the force level may be any region below the
curve.

erall Impressions
inks this is a really nice study that provides an elegant mechanistic explanation for why
wer output is higher in CMJ than SJ during the propulsive phase of jumping. In general, I find
clusions to be valid and well-grounded in muscle physiology. That being said, I do have a
major issues related to methodology (specifically ultrasound measurements), mechanistic
lanations for muscle-level performance, and depth of analysis given the instrumentation
d in this study. If these concerns are addressed, I will be happy to approve publication of
manuscript.
neral Concerns
asurement of Pennation Angle: It would be nice to see the mean and standard deviation of
ting and MVC trial measurements for pennation within a single image, or across a single trial.
ajor reason this sort of imaging is done within a single fascicle is because experimenters can
reasonably confident that, if a fascicle is visible throughout a contraction (i.e. it is in the
ge plane), its rotation was minimal and nearly all displacement occurred along the axis of
nation. Ideally, there would be a validation of this methodology where the authors
thods, as well as actual whole fascicle length measurements, are performed in a single
ge (this would be possible in MG, LG, or Soleus). My intuition tells me that their
asurements are likely reflective of whole-fascicle behavior, and this would be ironclad proof
heir validity.
so understand that the muscles you are imaging are large, and that it is extremely difficult if
impossible to capture an entire fascicle over a meaningful range of motion with existing off-
-shelf probes. I think your approach to estimating fascicle angle based on superficial and
p aponeurosis and many portions of partially visible fascicles is a clever one, but I also think
necessary to report how much variability there is within a given measurement, and further
lain your sampling techniques (how many fascicles per image? Minimum sample
uirements? Mean and STD of # of measurements per image in this study?). I would also an
anded discussion at some point on possible sources of systematic error, etc, inherent in this
thodology.
chanistic Explanation of Enhanced VL Power Output in CMJ: First off, I absolutely agree that
combination of force-length potential, power-velocity potential, and activation play a
ificant role in observe increases in average power production. I would, however, like to see
e discussion of how lengthening prior to jumping might also benefit force/power
duction, and a brief duscission of the role that reflexes might play in the time-course of
scle activation prior to propulsion.
ltiple studies have shown that lengthening prior to or during muscle activation significantly
ances force production, and that transient effects persist well after the lengthening phase
ontraction (for a nice primer, see Josephson’s 1999 paper “Dissecting Muscle Power
put” in JEB, PMID: 10562519). From looking at the timecourse of lengthening, activation,
force production in figure 3, it appears that a substantial portion of the observed peak
ce is developed during active lengthening prior to the propulsive phase. This force is
eloped at a considerably higher rate than in the propulsive portion of SJ trial as well (based
visual inspection). Is it possible that pre-loading the tendon in flexion was partially
ponsible for the burst of power (via elastic recoil) observed in propulsion for the CMJ
dition?
so think you should mention stretch reflex as a potential source of activation in the CMJ
dition in particular. Your observed EMGs are much higher than reported MVC, which would
ke sense if a portion of it was coming from involuntary reflex.
mate of Muscle Level Power Output: Rate of power production/power potential as a
ction of shortening velocity of muscle seems to be a lynchpin to your arguments about
wer output during propulsion in CMJ versus SJ. You have recordings of fascicle level
avior, joint kinematics, ground reaction forces, and estimates of moment arm across the
e. With this dataset, as well as a reasonable estimate of VL peak cross-sectional area (PCSA)
tive to total knee extensor PCSA, you should have enough information to roughly estimate
scle-level force/power. A demonstration of this approach (as well as relevant citations
ted to its development) can be found in a 2012 PNAS paper from Farris and Sawicki (PMID:
19360), and PCSA values for all leg muscles can be found in a 1992 paper from Fukunaga et.
(PMID: 1403308). I think this is necessary to further cement your claims related to
anced average power output in the CMJ condition, and I would like to see it in revisions,
ng with the timecourse of VL power output in both the CMJ and SJ conditions in figure 3.
his analysis is done, it is not a tremendous stretch to estimate contributions from tendon to
pulsive power as well, or elastic energy storage/return in the flexion and extension phase of
CMJ condition, or extension for SJ. While I think this data would be very interesting to see
d only further strengthen your conclusions), it is not necessary to support the conclusions
draw about the role of active muscle for enhancing power output during propulsive phase
umping.
iting Style: Overall, I think this is very well written. The only major stylistic issue I have with
manuscript is the heavy use of words like “therefore”, “furthermore”, “thus”, etc. followed
a comma as a way of starting sentences. I think it is a nice touch in some places, but
erally overused (for my tastes). See paragraph 1 of the introduction for an example of this.
cific Concerns
es 27-32: I like the term force potential, but think maybe it should be defined before it is
d. If you have some words to spare in the abstract, it would be worth defining more clearly.
e 72-75: It is a great point that, in these systems, series compliance can greatly effect muscle
rating points and force production dynamics. Another point that I think should be made
e is that timing of muscle activation relative to muscle strain trajectory strongly influences
w series compliance is utilized (e.g., large amounts of energy cycling with zero net work,
wer generation, or energy absorption). There are multiple isolated muscle studies that
ely demonstrate this concept from Lichtwark and Barclay, CJ Ettema, and Sawicki and
erts.
e 77: quite, not quiet
e 86: considerably, not considerable
e 106: I think using the word “widely” here might be a bit strong. “Deficient” is appropriate,
ugh, in the context of this study, as you are certainly filling a gap in knowledge.
e 132-135: How was the knee angle restricted?
-190: How many fascicles did you manually digitize in each image? Was there a minimum
mber? Maximimum number? Would it be possible to give a mean a standard deviation value
this?
e 198-199: Why were you not able to determine F-L/F-V curves for two subjects? Did they
s some sort inclusion criteria? Was it difficulty with instrumentation? A brief statement on
y they were rejected should be included, even if it is only a few words.
-228: I would like to see this plastic cast, would it be possible to show it in figure 1? A
tograph or schematic of its orientation, etc., on a participant would be great.
-315: I think this sentence (which nicely summarizes the propulsive phase) would be either
ceded or followed by a statement regarding active lengthening during flexion, and the
dency for this to enhance force output during and after the lengthening phase (i.e. stretch
uced activation and history dependent force enhancement).
-361: I don’t entirely agree with this statement. I think muscle mechanical state and
ce/power potential are important, but I also think decoupling of muscle from joint level
avior with a series elastic actuator both enhances the rate at which power can be produced
elastic recoil) and allows the muscle to remain near a more optimal operating point for
ve power production. I would like to see a comparison of muscle velocity (which you have)
ngular velocity of the knee. I suspect that, given the shorter impulse time and greater
rage power, that there will be greater differences knee angular velocity than muscle
traction velocity, which can be accounted for by decoupling of muscle and joint level
amics through series elasticity (i.e. tendon). This can be done with existing data in table 1 to
ermine average angular velocity in propulsion, but a more detailed analysis of the
ecourse of power output during propulsion would be ideal (and should be possible with
r mocap dataset).
-378: I am not sure what point you are trying to get across here, or how you arrived at a
ue of 5.57L0/s. When I read this it sounded like you are saying “our observed shortening
ocities were close in value, and were not in a range where they would have any meaningful
ct”. I don’t think this is what you mean. Even if it is, I think an explanation of how you
ved at your value of 5.57 should be included.
-388: I think you should also include something about power potential in this sentence as
l, since it is pretty critical to your findings in this paper.
ure 3: I would like to see a plot of power here. Preferably muscle power. Previous studies
e used known moment arm relationships and estimates of force based on percentage of
k cross-sectional area for a given muscle group (e.g. knee extensors in your case). See
eral concerns for a more in-depth explanation of what I mean, and relevant resources to aid
his analysis.
Response to Reviewer #1:
N.B.: All changes have been signed in the revised manuscript.
Comment: I thinks this is a really nice study that provides an elegant mechanistic
explanation for why power output is higher in CMJ than SJ during the propulsive phase of
jumping. In general, I find conclusions to be valid and well-grounded in muscle physiology.
That being said, I do have a few major issues related to methodology (specifically ultrasound
measurements), mechanistic explanations for muscle-level performance, and depth of
analysis given the instrumentation used in this study. If these concerns are addressed, I will
be happy to approve publication of this manuscript.
Response: Thank you for the appreciation and valuable remarks.
General Concerns
Comment: Measurement of Pennation Angle: It would be nice to see the mean and
standard deviation of resting and MVC trial measurements for pennation within a single
image, or across a single trial. A major reason this sort of imaging is done within a single
fascicle is because experimenters can be reasonably confident that, if a fascicle is visible
throughout a contraction (i.e. it is in the image plane), its rotation was minimal and nearly all
displacement occurred along the axis of pennation. Ideally, there would be a validation of
this methodology where the authors methods, as well as actual whole fascicle length
measurements, are performed in a single image (this would be possible in MG, LG, or Soleus).
My intuition tells me that their measurements are likely reflective of whole-fascicle behavior,
and this would be ironclad proof of their validity.
I also understand that the muscles you are imaging are large, and that it is extremely difficult
if not impossible to capture an entire fascicle over a meaningful range of motion with
existing offthe-shelf probes. I think your approach to estimating fascicle angle based on
superficial and deep aponeurosis and many portions of partially visible fascicles is a clever
one, but I also think it is necessary to report how much variability there is within a given
measurement, and further explain your sampling techniques (how many fascicles per
image? Minimum sample requirements? Mean and STD of # of measurements per image in
this study?). I would also an expanded discussion at some point on possible sources of
systematic error, etc, inherent in this methodology.
Response: Thank you for these concerns. We added ultrasound images as well as fascicle
length and pennation angles changes from rest to MVC in figure 1. The mean and standard
deviation of pennation angles at rest and MVC measurements for a single image were 11.7
±1.5 and 16.5 ±1.8 degrees respectively. The VL fascicle length during the investigated jumps
were on average between 6.8 and 13.2 cm (table 2). We used an ultrasound device with a
linear array probe of 10 cm, which is clearly longer compared to most of the commonly used
ultrasound systems (i.e. 4 to 6 cm). With the 10 cm probe a great part of the VL fascicles (75
to 100 %) was visible in the image. Studies investigating the validity of the ultrasound-based
determination of fascicle length reported an acceptable validity for VL and vastus
intermedius (Ando et al., 2014, J. Electromyogr. Kinesiol. 24, 214-220) as well as for
ultrasound-based methodology shows a systematic underestimation the VL fascicle length,
the average differences are ~6 % (Ando et al., 2014).
We added the following text in the method and discussion parts:
“Visible fascicles were considered as valid, when the length of the feature was = 0.5cm. In the
current study the mean and standard deviation of the digitized visible fascicles for every
video frame was 10 ±7 (using a minimum of 5 fascicles per frame).” Lines: 197-200
“The mean variability of the fascicle angles of the single features that were used for the
calculation of the representative reference fascicle in every image was 15% and 14% for the
SJ and CMJ respectively.” Lines: 245-247.
“Ultrasound provides a two-dimensional image and therefore the fascicle length will be
underestimated in the case that the digitised fascicles do not lie in the image plane. Studies
investigating the validity of the ultrasound-based determination of fascicle length reported
an acceptable validity for VL and vastus intermedius (Ando et al., 2014, J. Electromyogr.
Kinesiol. 24, 214-220) as well as for gastrocnemius medialis (Bolsterlee et al., 2015, J.
Biomech. 48, 1133-1140). In general, the ultrasound-based methodology shows a systematic
underestimation the VL fascicle length with average differences of ~6 % (Ando et al., 2014).”
Lines: 423-429.
Comment: Mechanistic Explanation of Enhanced VL Power Output in CMJ: First off, I
absolutely agree that the combination of force-length potential, power-velocity potential,
and activation play a significant role in observe increases in average power production. I
would, however, like to see some discussion of how lengthening prior to jumping might also
benefit force/power production, and a brief duscission of the role that reflexes might play in
the time-course of muscle activation prior to propulsion.
Multiple studies have shown that lengthening prior to or during muscle activation
significantly enhances force production, and that transient effects persist well after the
lengthening phase of contraction (for a nice primer, see Josephson’s 1999 paper “Dissecting
Muscle Power Output” in JEB, PMID: 10562519). From looking at the time course of
lengthening, activation, and force production in figure 3, it appears that a substantial portion
of the observed peak force is developed during active lengthening prior to the propulsive
phase. This force is developed at a considerably higher rate than in the propulsive portion of
SJ trial as well (based on visual inspection). Is it possible that pre-loading the tendon in
flexion was partially responsible for the burst of power (via elastic recoil) observed in
propulsion for the CMJ condition?
I also think you should mention stretch reflex as a potential source of activation in the CMJ
condition in particular. Your observed EMGs are much higher than reported MVC, which
would make sense if a portion of it was coming from involuntary reflex.
Response: It is correct that following active muscle stretching or shortening, history
dependent phenomena of force production such as force enhancement and force depression
can be present, affecting muscle force and power production (Josephson, 1999, The Journal
of Experimental Biology 202, 3369–3375). Force enhancement has been shown to increase
with increasing stretch magnitude (Edman et al., 1982, The Journal of General Physiology 80,
769–784), being independent of stretch velocity (Edman et al., 1982) and to be activation-
dependent during voluntary contractions (Oskouei and Herzog, 2006, European Journal of
shortening magnitude (Marechal and Plaghki, 1979, The Journal of General Physiology 73,
453–467), with decreasing shortening velocity (Abbott and Aubert, 1952, Journal of
Physiology 117, 77–86) and with increasing activation levels (De Ruiter et al., 1998, Journal
of Physiology 507 (2), 583–591).
McGowan et al (2013, J. Biomech. 46, 151-157), using a simulation model, found that CMJ
performance was very similar with and without force enhancement/depression phenomena
of muscle contraction, providing evidence that history dependent effects during CMJ were
compensated for by changes in muscle activation. However, it cannot be excluded that force
depression phenomena during SJ may affect the muscles ability to generate force and, thus,
could contribute to the differences between SJ and CMJ. However, this fact does not reduce
the importance of our findings that intrinsic mechanisms of the VL muscle to generate force
and power contribute to the higher mean mechanical power output during the CMJ.
The average EMG-activity during the propulsion phase was higher in CMJ compared to SJ,
but the maximum value was similar in the two jumps, indicating no reflex facilitation in the
CMJ (figure 3). The reason for the higher average EMG-activity in CMJ were the higher values
in the beginning of the propulsion phase. Furthermore, during the downward phase in the
CMJ (lengthening of VL), the increase in the EMG-activity started with a delay to the
lengthening of the VL (figure 3). Although from our measurements is not possible to
differentiate reflex and voluntary components in the EMG-activity, it seems that the
increased muscle activity in CMJ during the downward phase was more related to the
deceleration of the centre of mass (i.e. ground reaction force higher than the body weight).
We added the following text in the discussion:
“It is well known that following active muscle stretching or shortening, history dependent
phenomena of force production such as force enhancement and force depression affect
muscle force and power production (Josephson, 1999, The Journal of Experimental Biology
202, 3369–3375). Although McGowan et al. (2013 J. Biomech. 46, 151-157), using a
simulation model, found that CMJ performance was very similar with and without force
enhancement/depression phenomena of muscle contraction, providing evidence that history
dependent effects during CMJ were compensated for by changes in muscle activation, it
cannot be excluded that force depression phenomena during SJ may affect the muscles
ability to generate force. However, this possibility does not reduce the importance of our
findings that intrinsic mechanisms of the VL muscle to generate force and power contribute
to the higher mean mechanical power output during the CMJ.” Lines: 399-408.
The possible effect of the tendon “elastic recoil” on the mechanical output during the
propulsion phase of the CMJ is discussed in lines: 389-399.
Comment: Estimate of Muscle Level Power Output: Rate of power production/power
potential as a function of shortening velocity of muscle seems to be a lynchpin to your
arguments about power output during propulsion in CMJ versus SJ. You have recordings of
fascicle level behavior, joint kinematics, ground reaction forces, and estimates of moment
arm across the knee. With this dataset, as well as a reasonable estimate of VL peak cross-
sectional area (PCSA) relative to total knee extensor PCSA, you should have enough
information to roughly estimate muscle-level force/power. A demonstration of this
approach (as well as relevant citations related to its development) can be found in a 2012
can be found in a 1992 paper from Fukunaga et. Al. (PMID: 1403308). I think this is necessary
to further cement your claims related to enhanced average power output in the CMJ
condition, and I would like to see it in revisions, along with the time course of VL power
output in both the CMJ and SJ conditions in figure 3. If this analysis is done, it is not a
tremendous stretch to estimate contributions from tendon to propulsive power as well, or
elastic energy storage/return in the flexion and extension phase of the CMJ condition, or
extension for SJ. While I think this data would be very interesting to see (and only further
strengthen your conclusions), it is not necessary to support the conclusions you draw about
the role of active muscle for enhancing power output during propulsive phase of jumping.
Response: Thank you very much for the suggestion to calculate force/power of muscles
comparable to the approach reported by Farris and Sawicki (2012). You are correct that
using our experimental data and taking into account considerable assumptions as for
example in the study of Farris and Sawicki (2012) we will be able to calculate muscle force
and power. With all respect to this study (Farris and Sawicki, 2012), we believe that the
assumptions taken in such an approach are very strong, which may dramatically affect the
calculated values and therefore we would prefer not to include this approach in our
manuscript. Actually, we were familiar with the approach mentioned above when we
designed the study, but we decided to take another one.
First, the calculation of the patellar tendon force during the jumps using the resultant knee
joint moments, which can be calculated by inverse dynamics, and the patellar tendon
moment arm, would be based on the assumption that only the quadriceps femoris muscle is
responsible for the resultant knee joint moment. However, the resultant joint moment is the
algebraic sum of all moments acting on the joint (i.e. synergist and antagonist muscles,
ligaments and bones). During both jumps, we measured a high level of activity in the biceps
femoris (37 to 45% of the MVC). This means the assumption that only the quadriceps femoris
is responsible for the resultant knee joint moment is not correct.
Second, the calculation of the VL muscle force using the PCSA of the VL relative to the other
quadriceps muscles would premise that the force-potential due to the force length/velocity
relationship and activation of all quadriceps muscles are equal. This assumption, at least for
the biarticular rectus femoris muscle cannot be correct.
Third, the complex shape changes and morphological interactions within the muscle-tendon
unit cannot be predicted by simple planimetric geometrical models (Bolsterlee et al., 2017, J.
Appl. Physiol. doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00976.2016) as usually adopted in those calculations.
Taking into consideration these relevant methodological limitations we decided not to
include calculations of force/power and tendon strain energy in our study. Rather, we tried to
develop a methodological design that allows us to consider experimentally-assessed basic
mechanisms for muscle force and power production (i.e. muscle force potential due to the
force-length and force-velocity relationship and muscle activation) and to investigate these
mechanisms in the two jumps.
Comment: Writing Style: Overall, I think this is very well written. The only major stylistic
issue I have with this manuscript is the heavy use of words like “therefore”, “furthermore”,
“thus”, etc. followed by a comma as a way of starting sentences. I think it is a nice touch in
some places, but generally overused (for my tastes). See paragraph 1 of the introduction for
an example of this.
Response: Thank you very much for this comment. We tried to reduce this stylistic issue
Specific Concerns
Comment: Lines 27-32: I like the term force potential, but think maybe it should be defined
before it is used. If you have some words to spare in the abstract, it would be worth defining
more clearly.
Response: We defined force-length potential as fraction of VL maximum force according to
the force-length relationship, force-velocity potential as fraction of VL maximum force
according to the force-velocity relationship and power-velocity potential as fraction of VL
maximum power according to the power-velocity relationship in the abstract of the revised
manuscript.
Comment: Line 72-75: It is a great point that, in these systems, series compliance can
greatly effect muscle operating points and force production dynamics. Another point that I
think should be made here is that timing of muscle activation relative to muscle strain
trajectory strongly influences how series compliance is utilized (e.g., large amounts of
energy cycling with zero net work, power generation, or energy absorption). There are
multiple isolated muscle studies that nicely demonstrate this concept from Lichtwark and
Barclay, CJ Ettema, and Sawicki and Roberts.
Response: Thank you for this suggestion. We added the following text in the introduction:
“The time course of activation (i.e. neural control of muscle contraction) plays a key role in
the interaction between tendons and muscles and can affect the efficiency of muscle force
and power production (Ettema, 1996, Journal of Experimental Biology 199, 1983–1997;
Lichtwark and Barclay, 2010, Journal of Experimental Biology 213, 707-714; Sawicki et al.,
2015, Journal of Experimental Biology (2015) 218, 3150-3159).“ Lines: 76-78.
Comment: Line 77: quite, not quiet
Response: Corrected.
Comment: Line 86: considerably, not considerable
Response: Corrected.
Comment: Line 106: I think using the word “widely” here might be a bit strong. “Deficient”
is appropriate, though, in the context of this study, as you are certainly filling a gap in
knowledge.
Response: The word “widely” is deleted in the revised manuscript.
Comment: Line 132-135: How was the knee angle restricted?
“We restricted the knee joint angle at 90° by controlling the downward amplitude of the hip.
At the beginning of the experiment we identified for each participant the position (i.e. height)
of the hip where the knee joint angle was 90° using the Vicon system. We marked the
identified height with an elastic rope fixed in between two poles on the right and left side of
the participants. After a short accustoming protocol, the participants were able to achieve
the required position without feedback information.” Lines: 137-142.
Comment: 187-190: How many fascicles did you manually digitize in each image? Was
there a minimum number? Maximimum number? Would it be possible to give a mean a
standard deviation value for this?
Response: Thank you for this comment. As we responded in the general concerns we added
the following text in the method part:
“Visible fascicles were considered as valid, when the length of the feature was = 0.5cm. In the
current study the mean and standard deviation of the digitized visible fascicles for every
video frame was 10 ±7 (minimum 5 per frame).” Lines: 197-200.
Comment: Line 198-199: Why were you not able to determine F-L/F-V curves for two
subjects? Did they miss some sort inclusion criteria? Was it difficulty with instrumentation?
A brief statement on why they were rejected should be included, even if it is only a few
words.
Response: For the two participants we were not able to determine the force-fascicle length
relationship because of technical problems in the capturing of the reflective markers during
the maximum isometric contractions. In these two participants it was not possible to
calculate the resultant knee-joint moments in all investigated knee-joint positions.
We added the following sentence in the revised manuscript:
“Due to technical problems in the capturing of the reflective markers during the maximum
isometric contractions we were not able to determine the force-fascicle length curve for two
participants and, therefore, these participants were not included in the analysis of the
operating-length and velocity.” Lines: 209-212.
Comment: 226-228: I would like to see this plastic cast, would it be possible to show it in
figure 1? A photograph or schematic of its orientation, etc., on a participant would be great.
Response: We added a photograph as required in figure 1.
Comment: 313-315: I think this sentence (which nicely summarizes the propulsive phase)
would be either preceded or followed by a statement regarding active lengthening during
flexion, and the tendency for this to enhance force output during and after the lengthening
phase (i.e. stretch induced activation and history dependent force enhancement).
Response: We responded to the general comments of the reviewer regarding stretch-induced
and force depression and their possible effects during the investigated SJ and CMJ.
Comment: 359-361: I don’t entirely agree with this statement. I think muscle mechanical
state and force/power potential are important, but I also think decoupling of muscle from
joint level behavior with a series elastic actuator both enhances the rate at which power can
be produced (via elastic recoil) and allows the muscle to remain near a more optimal
operating point for active power production. I would like to see a comparison of muscle
velocity (which you have) to angular velocity of the knee. I suspect that, given the shorter
impulse time and greater average power, that there will be greater differences knee angular
velocity than muscle contraction velocity, which can be accounted for by decoupling of
muscle and joint level dynamics through series elasticity (i.e. tendon). This can be done with
existing data in table 1 to determine average angular velocity in propulsion, but a more
detailed analysis of the timecourse of power output during propulsion would be ideal (and
should be possible with your mocap dataset).
Response: Thank you very much for this indication. We calculated the ratio (CMJ to SJ) of the
mean VL muscle-tendon unit (MTU) velocity and VL fascicle velocity and we found that the
ratio was significantly lower on the fascicle level compared to MTU level (1.31 ±0.25 vs. 1.58
±0.31, p<0.001). The lower ratio on the fascicle level provides evidence that tendon
compliance facilitated to a greater degree the force-velocity potential in CMJ compared to
the SJ.
We added in table 2 the shortening, mean and maximum shortening velocity of the VL MTU.
We added the following text in the method, results and discussion:
“The length changes of the VL muscle-tendon unit (MTU) was calculated as the product of
the individual angle-specific patellar tendon lever arm and the change in knee joint angle
(Lutz and Rome, 1996; Am J Physiol. 271, C563-C570).” Lines: 248-250.
“The shortening of the VL MTU was larger compared to the VL fascicle (p<0.001) but without
any differences (p=0.648) between the two jumps. The mean and maximum shortening
velocity of the VL MTU were higher in CMJ (p<0.001 and p<0.001 respectively). The ratio
(CMJ to SJ) of the mean VL MTU velocity and VL fascicle velocity was significantly lower on
the fascicle level (1.31 ±0.25 vs. 1.58 ±0.31, p<0.001), indicating a smaller increase in
shortening velocity from SJ to CMJ in fascicles compared to the MTU.” Lines: 283-288.
“The lower ratio (CMJ to SJ) of the VL fascicle mean velocity compared to the VL MTU mean
velocity shows that the elongation of the tendon prevents a similar increase in VL fascicle
shortening velocity as in the MTU during the CMJ and that the facilitation of the force-
velocity potential due to tendon compliance is greater during the CMJ compared to the SJ.”
Lines: 361-365.
Comment: 373-378: I am not sure what point you are trying to get across here, or how you
arrived at a value of 5.57L0/s. When I read this it sounded like you are saying “our observed
shortening velocities were close in value, and were not in a range where they would have
any meaningful effect”. I don’t think this is what you mean. Even if it is, I think an
explanation of how you arrived at your value of 5.57 should be included.
Response: Thank you for this comment. We explained in more detail in the revised
manuscript how we conceived the value of 5.57 L0/s. We measured mean VL fascicle
shortening velocities during SJ and CMJ of 1.44 L0/s and 1.84 L0/s, respectively, and we
concluded that the power potential in CMJ is higher than in SJ. In the case that the VL
optimal shortening velocity for power production is higher than 1.84 L0/s, the measured
mean shortening velocity of VL in SJ (1.44 L0/s) will be in the ascending part of the power-
velocity relationship and, thus, the power potential in SJ will be lower than in the CMJ. From
the Hill equation we know that the optimal shortening velocity for power production is 33%
of the maximum shortening velocity. This means that the lowest threshold of the VL
maximum shortening velocity would be a velocity that its 33% is 1.84 L0/s (i.e. Vmax=5.57 L0/s).
We added the following text in the discussion:
“In case that the VL optimal shortening velocity for power production would be higher than
1.84 L0/s, the measured mean shortening velocity of VL in SJ (1.44 L0/s) would be in the
ascending part of the power-velocity relationship and, thus, the power potential in SJ will be
lower than in the CMJ. This means that the lowest threshold of the VL Vmax that could affect
our results would be a Vmax that, according to Hill, its 33% is 1.84 L0/s (i.e. Vmax=5.57 L0/s).”
Lines: 438-442.
Comment: 387-388: I think you should also include something about power potential in this
sentence as well, since it is pretty critical to your findings in this paper.
Response: Thank you for this suggestion. We added the advantages of the power potential in
the CMJ compared to SJ in the conclusion part of the revised manuscript. Line: 491.
Comment: Figure 3: I would like to see a plot of power here. Preferably muscle power.
Previous studies have used known moment arm relationships and estimates of force based
on percentage of peak cross-sectional area for a given muscle group (e.g. knee extensors in
your case). See general concerns for a more in-depth explanation of what I mean, and
relevant resources to aid in this analysis.
Response: We added the resultant knee joint moment and the knee joint mechanical power
in figure 3.
N.B.: All changes have been signed in the revised manuscript.
Comment: In general, I found this to be an interesting paper that is well organised, clear
and with some novel approaches to understanding the influence of muscle mechanics on
jumping performance. There is yet to be a consistent consensus about why
countermovement jumps (CMJ) outperform squat jumps (SJ): some of this is addressed in
this paper. The approach taken here was to examine how some of the prime power
producing muscles operate in vivo and compare this to measurements of the force
generating potential of the muscle at different lengths/velocities. This is nice approach.
However, I feel that there some major bits of information that are missing from this paper
that make the conclusions quite fraught with danger.
Response: Thank you for the appreciation and valuable remarks.
Comment: Firstly, a major premise behind the study is that CMJ generates greater mean
power output (and hence work) than the SJ. This must be the case for one jump to be higher
than the other, however the authors presume that this means that the quadriceps muscles
must also generate more power, neglecting potential differences in joint contributions.
Consider that it is possible that all of the extra power comes from the ankle or hip – the later
has been suggested and shown by Fukashiro & Komi (Int J Sports Med, 1987). This would
mean that the quadriceps muscles, including VL, might be generating very similar average
power and work in the two jumps (even if this performed in a different manner). Therefore,
I believe that the authors need to perform calculations of the knee power and work
generated (considering both negative and positive phases) to be able to make any
conclusions about the power generating potential of the VL during this task and how this
influences performance.
Response: Thank you for this remark. In our manuscript, we did not conclude that the
differences found between SJ and CMJ can solely be explained by the VL. We rather proposed
that the contribution of the VL to the observed differences in the mean mechanical power is
important. This conclusion can be supported by information from the literature based on in
vivo measurements of the patellar and Achilles tendon force (Finni et al., 2000, Eur. J. Appl.
Physiol. 83, 416-426) as well as based on musculoskeletal modeling predictions (Anderson
and Pandy, 1993, J. Biomech. 12, 1413-1427). Finni et al. (2000) measured the Achilles and
patellar tendon forces during SJ and CMJ in vivo using the optical fiber methodology and
reported greater peak mechanical power of the quadriceps femoris muscle (a factor of ~2.5)
compared to the triceps surae muscle. Furthermore, and more importantly, the increase of
mechanical power in the CMJ compared to the SJ was in the quadriceps femoris muscle ~200
Watt, while in the triceps surae the increase was considerably lower (i.e. ~85 Watt).
Anderson and Pandy (1993), using a musculoskeletal model, found that the vastii together
with the gluteus maximus were the main contributors of the mechanical energy transfer to
the skeleton during the push-off phase of the SJ and CMJ. These studies provide clear
evidence for the importance of the VL muscle to the energy and power generation during SJ
and CMJ. It is correct, that Fukashiro and Komi (1987, Int. J. Sports Med. 8, 15-21), using an
inverse dynamic approach, reported that the main differences in the mechanical
energy/work production during the push off phase between SJ and CMJ were in the hip joint.
Methodological deficits, however, limited the evidence of this conclusion. First, the authors
of the ground reaction force, which is very important for the calculation of the resultant
ankle-, knee- and hip joint moments, can be dramatically affected for the horizontal
anteroposterior ground reaction force. Second, the center of pressure (point of the ground
reaction force application) was not measured but assumed to be the cross point of the line
joining the ankle joint and the big toe with the force plate during the jump. This assumption
is not correct, because the center of pressure can be moved under the foot. Both limitations
(i.e. not to measure the direction and the point of force application of the ground reaction
force) can essentially bias the lever arms of the ground reaction force to the hip, knee- and
ankle joints and, thus, the calculation of the mechanical work at these joints. Finally, this
study (Fukashiro and Komi, 1987) investigated only one participant and, therefore, the
reported values might not be representative for a larger population.
In the revised manuscript we provide a more engaging discussion regarding the importance
of the VL muscle to the mechanical work and power contribution during SJ and CMJ.
Furthermore, as suggested by the reviewer, we calculated the resultant ankle, knee and hip
joint moments, mechanical work and mechanical power by inverse dynamics. The results
support our expectation, showing that the maximum resultant joint moments were increased
in CMJ at the knee (9%) and hip (22%) joints, the mean joint power were increased at all
joints (ankle: 60%, knee: 66%, hip: 67%) and the mechanical joint work at the knee (9%) and
hip (10%) joints.
We included the following paragraphs in the introduction, method, results and discussion
parts:
“Finni et al. (2000) measured the Achilles and patellar tendon force during SJ and CMJ in vivo
using the optical fiber methodology and reported greater peak mechanical power of the
quadriceps femoris (a factor of ~2.5) compared to the triceps surae muscle.” Lines: 86-89.
“The resultant ankle, knee and hip joint moments were calculated using inverse dynamics
(Arampatzis et al., 1999, J. Biomech. 32, 1349-1353). The mechanical power of each joint
was calculated as a product of joint moment and joint angular velocity. Finally, the joint
mechanical work during the propulsion phase of the jumps was calculated as the integral of
the mechanical power over the time.“ Lines: 226-230.
“The maximal resultant joint moments increased at the knee (p=0.012) and hip (p<0.001)
joints in CMJ compared to SJ and did not show any statistically significant differences at the
ankle joint (p=0.443, table 2). Although the mean mechanical power was enhanced in all
three joints in the CMJ (p<0.001), the maximal joint mechanical power was only significantly
higher at the hip joint (p=0.007; table 2). The mechanical work during the propulsion phase
increased at the knee (p=0.036) and hip joint (p=0.006), but not at the ankle joint (p=0.338)
in the CMJ compared to SJ (table 2).” Lines: 270-276.
“In the CMJ the maximum resultant moment, mean mechanical power and mechanical work
at the knee joint during the propulsion phase increased by 9%, 66% and 9% respectively
compared to the SJ. These values indicate that, although muscles acting at the ankle and hip
joints contribute to the performance-enhancement (i.e. jump height and mean mechanical
power) in CMJ, the knee extensors are important contributors for to the found differences.”
Lines: 322-327.
Comment: Secondly, the paper relies heavily on estimated values of the force-velocity and
hence power-velocity relationship for this muscle and I believe they may be drastically
conclusions where the muscle operates on its power curve are far too sensitive to unknown
parameters of the force-velocity curve. I have elaborated on this below, but I believe this
part of the paper needs to be removed, because it is too speculative and dependent on the
values chosen.
While the result that there is a higher average and peak velocity in the CMJ will still remain
(and hence there must be a drop overall force potential due this) regardless of the estimates
used, the interpretation of the potential for greater power production could be drastically
overestimated. The authors have used some literature estimations of the maximum
shortening velocity (11.85 Lo/s) from a modelling / simulation study which has very little
biological support. The authors address this briefly in the discussion, however they suggest
that their results would not be affected unless the maximum velocity was less than 5.57Lo/S.
It is not clear why this value was chosen (is it the maximum shortening measured?), however
if this value were the Vmax then this would shift the ‘average’ shortening velocities for both
CMJ and SJ towards the optimum of the power curve and this may change the authors
conclusions about the power generating potential of the VL muscle. Estimates for VL Vmax
from skinned fibres would predict temperature dependent maximum shortening velocities
between 5-15 Lo/s, depending on fibre type contributions and the Q10 value used (and
whether these fibres can indeed shorten independently). This is a broad range of
possibilities and probably does not help a lot in this case, except to say there is large
uncertainty when scaling these types of measures to the whole muscle. The only other study
that has investigated shortening dependent behaviour of the VL uses similar ultrasound
technology to the present study – the study by Fontana et al (2014) cited in the discussion.
While the authors suggest that this study predicts a maximum shortening velocity above
5.57 Lo/s, I had a look at this data and believe that Vmax is probably only a little over this
value. In fact, if you convert the fascicle based curve from their figure 5 to a power curve,
the peak power occurs at around 2 Lo/s (their highest velocity). This is siginifcantly lower
than the peak power based on the hypothetical curves proposed by the authors here
(approximately 3.9Lo/s) and could modify the conclusions that there is a power generating
advantage in the CMJ or even make this result more strong. Therefore, I believe the authors
either need to conduct a study similar to the Fontana study, or find a better way to justify
their selection of Vmax and the appropriate curvature of the F-V curve.
Response: We agree with your opinion that the chosen maximal shortening velocity (11.85
L0/s) may affect the conclusion regarding the higher VL power potential in CMJ compared to
the SJ.
First to your question, why a maximum shortening velocity of 5.57 L0/s would not influence
our conclusion that the mean power potential for the CMJ is higher than during SJ. We
measured mean VL fascicle shortening velocities during SJ and CMJ of 1.44 L0/s and 1.84 L0/s,
respectively, and we concluded that the power potential in CMJ is higher than in SJ. In the
case that the VL optimal shortening velocity for power production is higher than 1.84 L0/s the
measured mean shortening velocity of VL in SJ (1.44 L0/s) will be in the ascending part of the
power-velocity relationship and, thus, the power potential in SJ will be lower than in the CMJ.
From the Hill equation we know that the optimal shortening velocity for power production is
33% of the maximum shortening velocity. This means that the lowest threshold of the VL
maximum shortening velocity would be a velocity that its 33% is 1.84 L0/s (i.e. Vmax=5.57 L0/s).
It is correct that we assessed the maximum shortening velocity of 11.85 L0/s using specific
muscle values (arel=0.34 and brel=4.03s-1) taken from the literature (Miller et al., 2012). As you
mentioned, the range of maximum shortening velocity of muscle fibres is broad and depend
529) reported maximum shortening velocities of 7.02 ±0.35 L0/s and 13.00 ±0.45 L0/s of the
rat slow-twitch soleus and in the fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus respectively,
measured at 35° C. At 37° C (human in vivo temperature), the data from Ranatunga (1984)
predict maximum shortening velocities of 7.71 L0/s and 14.15 L0/s for the soleus and
digitorum longus, respectively. Therefore, the study of Ranatunga (1984) provides biological
support that the maximum shortening velocity of human VL with a proportion of fast-twitch
fibres between 54% and 59% (Staron et al., 2000, J Histochem Cytochem 48, 623–629;
Widrick et al., 2002, Am J Physiol Regulatory Integrative Comp Physiol 283, R408–R416;
Korhonen et al., 2006, J Appl Physiol 101, 906–917) would be substantially higher than 5.57
L0/s.
You correctly mentioned that the data of Fontana et al. (2014, J. Electromyography
Kinesiology 24, 934–940), investigating the force-velocity relationship of the human VL in
vivo, predict a maximum shortening velocity of 6.0 L0/s, which is only slightly higher to the
threshold of 5.57 L0/s. However, in this study (Fontana et al., 2014) the effects of the
activation deficit of the knee extensors and the co-activation of the hamstrings during the
isokinetic contractions were not considered. There is evidence that the activation deficit of
the knee extensors during concentric is higher compared to isometric contractions (Babault
et al., 2001, J Appl Physiol 69: 2628–2634) and that the co-activation of the hamstrings can
significantly affect the moment measured on the dynamometer (i.e. 20%, Aagaard et al.,
2000, Scand J Med Sci Sports, 10: 58–67) and, thus, the shape of the force-velocity
relationship. For example, in the study of Fontana et al. (2014), the measured EMG-activity
during the isokinetic contractions was ~70% of the EMG-activity of the isometric contractions.
Considering an activation deficit of 30% in the data of Fontana et al. (2014), though still
neglecting possible effects of the hamstring co-activation, the predicted maximum
shortening velocity of the VL increase to 8.5 L0/s (see figure below). Finni et al. (2003, Acta
Physiol Scand 177, 483–491) measured patellar tendon force using the optic fiber
methodology and peak shortening velocities of the VL using ultrasonography during
isometric and three isokinetic contractions (60, 120 and 180 °/s). The patellar tendon force –
VL fascicle shortening velocity relationship (figure 5 in Finni et al., 2003) demonstrates a
shortening velocity of 20 cm/s) at a patellar tendon force of 57% of the isometric maximum.
Using these values (shortening velocity of 20 cm/s at 57% of isometric maximum) the Hill
equation predicts a maximum shortening velocity for the VL muscle of 124 cm/s (i.e. 6.2
times of the velocity at 57% maximum force, manuscript figure 4). We found an optimum
fascicle length of 9.4 cm and, therefore, the predicted maximum shortening velocity of 124
cm/s from Finni et al. (2003) corresponds to 13.2 L0/s. Therefore, we believe that the reports
mentioned above provide physiological evidence that the VL maximum shortening velocity is
significantly higher than 5.57 L0/s.
We added the following text in the discussion:
“In case that the VL optimal shortening velocity for power production would be higher than
1.84 L0/s the measured mean shortening velocity of VL in SJ (1.44 L0/s) would be in the
ascending part of the power-velocity relationship and, thus, the power potential in SJ would
be lower than in the CMJ. This means that the lowest threshold of the VL V max that could
affect our results would be a Vmax that, according to Hill, its 33% is 1.84 L0/s (i.e. Vmax=5.57
L0/s). The latter seems to be unlikely for the vastus lateralis, a muscle with a proportion of
fast-twitch fibres between 54% and 59% [35-37]. Reports from Ranatunga (1984) predict
maximum shortening velocities for the slow-twitch rat soleus of 7.71 L0/s and for the fast-
twitch extensor digitorum longus of 14.15 L0/s at 37° Celsius (human in vivo temperature). A
recent study by Fontana et al. [38] investigated the force-velocity relationship of the human
vastus lateralis in vivo and their data predict a maximum shortening velocity of ~6.0 L0/s
which is only slightly higher to the threshold of 5.57 L0/s. However, in this study (Fontana et
al., 2014) the effects of the activation deficit of the knee extensors and the co-activation of
the hamstrings during the isokinetic contractions were not considered. There is evidence that
the co-activation of the hamstrings can significantly affect the moment measured on the
dynamometer during maximal isokinetic knee-extension contractions (i.e. 20%, Aagaard et
al., 2000, Scand J Med Sci Sports, 10: 58–67) and, thus, the shape of the force-velocity
relationship. In the study of Fontana et al. (2014), the measured EMG-activity during the
isokinetic contractions was ~70% of the EMG-activity of the isometric contractions.
Considering an activation deficit of 30% in the data of Fontana et al. (2014), though still
neglecting possible effects of the hamstring co-activation, the predicted maximum
shortening velocity of the VL would be clearly higher than 5.57 L0/s. Furthermore, Finni et al.
(2003) investigated the patellar tendon force – VL fascicle shortening velocity using the optic
fibre methodology and found peak VL shortening velocity of 20 cm/s at a patellar tendon
force of 57% of the isometric maximum. Using these values (shortening velocity of 20 cm/s at
57% of isometric maximum) the Hill equation predicts a maximum shortening velocity for the
VL muscle of 124 cm/s (i.e. 6.2 times of the velocity at 57% maximum force, figure 4)
corresponding to a 13.2 L0/s velocity. Therefore, we believe that the reports mentioned
above provide physiological evidence that the VL maximum shortening velocity is significant
higher than 5.57 L0/s.” Lines: 438-464.
Specific Comments
done at the knee (by the extensors)? I am not quite sure this is the major power producer.
Response: We calculated the resultant joint moments, the positive mechanical work and
power at the ankle, knee and hip joint using an inverse dynamic approach. The contribution
of the ankle, knee and hip joint to the total mechanical work within the lower extremities
was 29%, 29% and 42% for the SJ respectively and 28%, 29% and 43% for the CMJ. We added
this information in the revised manuscript. Lines: 473-477.
Comment: “To the best of our knowledge, the fascicle behaviour, operating length and
shortening velocity of the vastii muscles during SJ and CMJ in vivo have not been
investigated yet.” While this is a correct statement, I believe the authors have neglected the
nice work from Finni et al, 2000 (EJAP) and Finni et al 2003 (Acta Physiologica), where many
of these measures were conducted during these jumps (although no direct comparison of
vasti muscles were made). These results are obviously pertinent in the current study and
should be discussed in the introduction/discussion.
Response: Thank you very much for the suggestion of the two important studies. We
included the studies and we referred to their reports in several sections (introduction,
discussion) of the revised manuscript. Lines: 86-89, 458-463.
Comment: Is 43 frames per second sufficient to measure peak shortening velocities during a
dynamic task like jumping? How many frames are taken per upwards movement in the
jumps?
Response: In average, the push-off phase was 474 ms for the SJ and 302 ms for the CMJ
(table 1). This means, we had an average of 20 and 13 digitized frames for the SJ and CMJ
respectively. We believe that, considering the longer propulsion phases of SJ and CMJ
compared to explosive tasks as for example drop jumps, this recording frequency is
acceptable for the investigated tasks. Furthermore, our main conclusions are based on the
mean values of the shortening velocities and, therefore, the examined 20 and 13 frames
during each jump should be enough.
We added the following text in the discussion:
“In the current study we measured the VL fascicle length and calculated the shortening
velocity using an ultrasound device with a linear array probe that is relatively longer (i.e. 10
cm) compared to most of the commonly used ultrasound systems. The 10 cm probe is very
important for the accurate measurement of long fascicles as in the VL, because almost the
whole fascicle is visible in the image. The used capture frequency of 43 Hz, however, was
lower compared to the capture frequency of the Vicon system (250 Hz for kinematic data and
1000 Hz for analog data), which may introduce some bias in the measurement of the peak VL
shortening velocity. Our main conclusions, however, are based on the mean shortening
velocity during the propulsion phase of the two jumps. The average time of the push-off
phase was 474 and 302 ms for the SJ and CMJ, respectively. This means that the calculation
of the mean shortening velocity was based on in average 20 ultrasound images for the SJ and
13 for the CMJ, which in the authors opinion is enough to obtain representative values.”
Lines: 413-423.
‘average force potential’? This is what was done for the velocity data.
Response: We actually determined also the average force-length potential during the push-
off phase in the SJ and CMJ. Lines 296-298 and table 4.
Comment: Where have force/power estimates (y-axis values) on Figures 4/5 come from?
Are these estimates directly from the curve, or estimates based on the forces measured
during the jumps? Or have you just taken the velocity values and recalculated what the
force value must be for that axis?
Response: Figures 4 and 5 present the operating length and velocity of vastus lateralis
fascicles during the SJ and CMJ onto the normalized force-length, force-velocity and power-
velocity curves. The values in the horizontal axis present the mean values of the measured
fascicle length and velocity during the jumps normalized to the experimentally assessed
optimal fascicle length and estimated maximum shortening velocity, respectively. The values
in the vertical axis present the force-length, force-velocity and power-velocity potentials
calculated from the individual normalized force-length, force-velocity and power-velocity
relationship of each participant. We don’t know the exact muscle force during the SJ and CMJ
however, from the fascicle length and fascicle velocity data, we are able to assess
experimentally the force-length, force-velocity and power-velocity potentials that can be
presented as normalized values in the force-length, force-velocity and power velocity
relationship (i.e. force-length potential as a fraction of VL maximum force according to the
force-length relationship, force-velocity potential as a fraction of VL maximum force
according to the force-velocity relationship and power-velocity potential as a fraction of VL
maximum power according to the power-velocity relationship). We specify this point in
figures 4 and 5.
Comment: I believe that if Vmax was lower, then the fascicle velocities for both jumps would
sit closer to the optimum for power production. I am not sure if there would be a clear
difference in the resulting power potential. However, it has to be acknowledged that during
these jumps there may not be an increase in the work / average force / power at the knee
(driven by the quadriceps muscles) – this is why these measurements need to be made to
support the conclusions.
Response: We calculated the resultant joint moment, mechanical work and mechanical
power at the knee joint and we included this information in the revised manuscript.
Compared to the SJ the maximum resultant knee joint moment, mean mechanical power and
mechanical work during the propulsion phase increased by 9%, 66% and 9% respectively
compared to the SJ. We added this information in the discussion part of the revised
manuscript. Lines: 322-327.
Comment: The fact that there was an increase in activation is not given any extra context,
for instance is there also an increase in the force (or surrogate knee moment)?
Response: Thank you for this comment. It is correct that an increase in the activation does
not mean directly an increase in muscle force, because muscle force at a given time is
synchronously depend at least on two additional parameters, i.e. the force-length and force-
velocity potentials. As we mentioned before, we don’t know and we cannot calculate
accurately VL muscle force during the SJ and CMJ but we can experimentally assess muscle-
activity provides quite acceptable information regarding muscle activation. Therefore, we
choose this approach in our study, namely to assess VL muscle activation, force-length, force-
velocity and power-velocity potentials during the two investigated jumps. All these
parameters, although not the only ones, are important neurophysiological mechanisms
influencing muscle force and power generation. Given that during the push-off phase the
force-length-velocity potential is more or less similar between the two jumps a higher EMG-
activity predict higher muscle forces for the CMJ. In our experiment the average knee joint
moments were 13% (SJ: 0.93 ±0.18 N/kg, CMJ: 1.05 ±0.20 N/kg, p<0.001) higher in CMJ.
Comment: Further discussion point - There is also evidence that the force-velocity and force-
length relationships are not consistent across activations – i.e. submaximal activation see a
rightward shift of the force-length relationship and a reduction in maximum shortening
velocity. This should be mentioned as a limitation of the approach where maximum
isometric testing is used.
Response: Thank you for this comment. We mentioned this limitation in the revised
manuscript.
We added the following text in the discussion:
“We assessed the force-length curve during maximal isometric contractions at different knee
joint angles and using this relationship we calculated the force-length potential of the VL
muscle. There is evidence that the force-length curve depends on muscle activation (i.e.
optimum length increases with decreased activation; Rack and Westbury, 1969, J. Physiol.
204, 443-460). Therefore, using force-length curves from maximal activated muscles to
understand neurophysiological mechanisms during daily life tasks with submaximal activated
muscles has limitations. However, we measured an average EMG-activity in the propulsion
phase during the SJ and CMJ of 107 and 123% of the maximum isometric EMG-activity, which
indicates quite maximal muscle activity during the jumps and, thus, negligible effects of
activation-dependency on our interpretations.” Lines: 465-473.
Comment: The authors should also discuss that there are numerous other power producing
muscles that contribute and that could also be assessed in a similar manner to the methods
produced here. For instance, I believe the ankle produces more than 50% of the total
positive work for a vertical jump and hence the plantar flexors may show similar
relationships to the knee extensors.
Response: We agree with the reviewer that other muscles contribute to the energy and
power output during SJ and CMJ. We investigated the VL as a representative of the
quadriceps muscles because there is evidence in the literature that the knee extensors
provide an important contribution during both jumps (see also our response in the first
general comment). We mentioned this issue in the revised manuscript.
We added the following text in the discussion:
“Finally we evaluated the VL muscle as a representative of the quadriceps muscles in our
experiment. We found a significant increase in mean mechanical power also at the ankle
(60%) and hip joints (67%) in the CMJ. Further the contribution of the ankle, knee and hip
the SJ respectively and 28%, 29% and 43% for the CMJ. This means that also other muscles in
the lower extremities contribute to the performance enhancement during the CMJ and partly
can be investigated in a similar manner using the proposed methodology.” Lines: 473-480.

Comments to the Author(s)
Very nice work revising the paper. I just had a few minor issues that should be very easy to address.
I don't feel the need to re-review, but wanted to make sure these were brought to your attention.
General Comments:
Overall, I think you did a great job of addressing my initial concerns. Thank you for your efforts. I
hink the overall transparency of the paper has improved substantially, and that the study is more
eproducible now than in its initial form. Nice work!
Response: Thank you very much for the valuable remarks.
245-247: Thank you for including this. I assume mean variability is % deviation from computed
average? Please clarify what ‘mean variability’ is.
Response: Thank you for the comment. The clarification that it is in fact the coefficient of variation is
ncluded in the revised manuscript. [Line 245]
Specific Comments:
Line 34-35: Close your parentheses
Line 55: Your ‘However’ at the start of this sentence is unnecessary.
Line 72: ‘as for example tendon compliance’, the ‘as’ is unnecessary. ‘for example tendon
compliance’ works just fine.
Line 140: Substitute “Vicon system” with “motion capture system”.
Response: Thank you for the remarks. We changed the wording accordingly.
Line 144: I am unfamiliar with the word ‘accustoming’, although it is a real word according to the
nternet. I would use ‘acclimatizing’ in its place, but that is just personal preference.
Response: We changed the wording to “familiarisation". [Line 141]
Line 441: Wording here is very confusing. Particularly the statement “its 33% is 1.84 L0/s“
Response: We tried to phrase the sentence more clearly in the revised manuscript. The associated
ection now reads:
“We measured mean VL fascicle shortening velocities during SJ and CMJ of 1.44 L0/s and 1.84 L0/s
espectively. In case that the VL optimal shortening velocity for power production would be higher
han 1.84 L0/s the measured mean shortening velocity of VL in SJ (1.44 L0/s) would be in the
ascending part of the power-velocity relationship and the power potential in SJ would be lower than
n the CMJ. This means that the lowest threshold of the VL Vmax for this assumption to hold true
would be a Vmax of 5.57 L0/s, where the corresponding optimal shortening velocity would be 1.84
L0/s , assuming an approximate peak power at 33% of Vmax [11]. A lower Vmax than this threshold
eems to be unlikely for the vastus lateralis, a muscle with a proportion of fast-twitch fibres between
54% and 59% [44-46].” [Lines 440-443]

Comments to the Author(s)
believe that the authors have improved their manuscript and have now provided a robust scientific
argument and therefore believe that this nice paper should be published. I am particularly impressed
hat the authors have included the inverse dynamics calculations, which I think strengthen their
argument enormously.
Response: Thank you for your valuable contributions and suggestions.
have a few minor comments that I believe will improve the paper –
L437-463. I appreciate the authors deep explanation to support their power calculations and
estimates of Vmax. I agree with them that their estimates are reasonable, at least to a tolerance
where the interpretation shouldn’t change. However, this paragraph has become very long. I would
uggest removing L457-452, as these estimates are really back of the envelope calculations. I also
hink that you need to consider whether you are suggesting that sub-maximal activation from the
Fontana et al study would be likely to reduce the maximum shortening velocity, rather than just the
maximum force. In studies of human muscle, there is some evidence that submaximal activation
causes a reduction in the perceived Vmax, however in isolated muscle preparations do not often
how this relationship. In a recent really nice paper by Holt
http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2014.0002), it was shown that submaximal activation does reduce
Vmax, but this isn’t a simple function of fibre type recruitment and they suggest that compliance and
he requirement to accelerate the muscle mass (also explored by Ross and Wakeling DOI:
10.1098/rsbl.2015.1041). I think that things get a little complicated for you to be able to just shift the
F-v curve so that Vmax is ~30% higher when activation is 30% higher (i.e. 70 to 100%) – as was done
n the figure in the response document My suggestion would be this – to just say that the Fontana
paper estimates a lower value of Vmax than used in your model, but that this was potentially done at
ubmaximal activation levels (~70%) and that this might reduce the predicted maximum shortening
velocity (citing, for instance, the Holt paper). Then just say that regardless, the estimated Pmax value
would still be higher than the values reported in this study and hence your conclusions should still be
valid in this range.
Response: We tried to follow your suggestions in the modified manuscript that reads:
“A recent study by Fontana et al. [48] investigated the force-velocity relationship of the human vastus
ateralis in vivo and their data predict a maximum shortening velocity of ~6.0 L0/s, which is only
lightly higher than our calculated threshold of 5.57 L0/s. However, it needs to be considered that
both the submaximal activation levels (i.e. ~70%) during the isokinetic contractions [49] as well as not
aking into account hamstring co-activation in the estimation of fascicle forces (i.e. ~20%, [50]) likely
affected the predicted shape of the force-velocity relationship and led to an underestimation of
maximum shortening velocity in the study by Fontana and colleagues [48].” [Lines 448-452]
Please also reword the following sentence -
This means that the lowest threshold of the VL Vmax that could affect our results would be a Vmax
hat, according to Hill, its 33% is 1.84 L0/s (i.e. Vmax=5.57 L0/s).’
o read –
This means that the lowest threshold of the VL Vmax that could affect our results would be
Vmax=5.57 L0/s, assuming an approximate peak power at 33% of Vmax (insert Hill reference), which
must be greater than 1.84 L0/s.’
Note that the 33% is not a given, it is an approximate estimate – this value depends very much on
he curvature of the F-v relationship which is fibre type dependent.
ection now reads:
“We measured mean VL fascicle shortening velocities during SJ and CMJ of 1.44 L0/s and 1.84 L0/s
espectively. In case that the VL optimal shortening velocity for power production would be higher
han 1.84 L0/s the measured mean shortening velocity of VL in SJ (1.44 L0/s) would be in the
ascending part of the power-velocity relationship and the power potential in SJ would be lower than
n the CMJ. This means that the lowest threshold of the VL Vmax for this assumption to hold true
would be a Vmax of 5.57 L0/s, where the corresponding optimal shortening velocity would be 1.84
L0/s , assuming an approximate peak power at 33% of Vmax [11]. A lower Vmax than this threshold
eems to be unlikely for the vastus lateralis, a muscle with a proportion of fast-twitch fibres between
54% and 59% [44-46].” [Lines 440-443]
Figure 4 & 5 – I appreciate the changes in the text of the figure to better explain what the points on
he graph mean, however, it is still very confusing, especially because the points don’t actually sit on
he curves. I would suggest using shaded areas that go from the lines of each curve fit down to the x-
axis, with the width of the line representing the range in the lengths or velocities for each
measurement. This would better imply that the force level may be any region below the curve.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We prepared the figure accordingly.
