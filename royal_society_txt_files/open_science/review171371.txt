I think the authors have identified an extremely interesting research question. As they state in
their discussion, the potential of using alt metrics as an early indicator of scholarly impact is very
promising, in particular given the lag between publication and citation count. As such, I deem the
research question to be timely and novel.
However, I feel that the results and the extent of their validity are rather limited. For instance, in
the analysis of the potential relationship between citations, journal impact factor and Altmetric
score, there is a very limited range both in terms of journal impact factor (which varies only
between 0.5 and 2.5) and citation count (which varies between 1 and 30). Analogously, the effect
of journal identity on AAS is basically non existent, given that it results in a coefficient of
determination of 0.08. The authors state that the effect is lower in this case, but I'd argue that such
a small coefficient of determination is not really indicative of any effect, despite the statistical
significance.Also, the increase of AAS with publication year may simply suggest an increase in
overall usage of online tools to promote academic research.
I appreciate that it may be rather difficult to have a broader data set to analyse in a specialised
field such as ornithology, but I think that this is a major shortcoming of this manuscript.
All in all, the analysis in this article is performed accurately and rigorously, but in its current
form the manuscript is rather descriptive and with limited results, which in my opinion don't
make a significant contribution to the literature.

This is an interesting look at what is not a simple problem of trying to measure the non-citation
impact of scholarly work. As ecology and especially ornithology continues to try and find a way
3
to better measure how our work influences the world I commend the authors for tackling this
question. Overall I found it to be a strong paper with interesting results, below are a few minor
comments on places where the text could be made more clear and a few notes on additional
topics I think would benefit the paper and help set it in the larger context.
line 15 - It would be informative to make this sentance more specific to communicating scientific
research. Since being able to communicate other parts of science via online tools would not lead
us to be interested in citation rates
line 34 - it might be helpful to define what falls under social media, are you counting blogs? are
you counting mass media coverage? Not all readers will know what does and does not fall in this
category and providing this baseline level would help them with the rest of the paper.
line 109 - What version of R and the 'lme4' package were used? Please report and cite.
line 114 - Are the values here reported in the results section on the log scale, since some of the
data was transformed? or have the results been transformed back onto the original scale? This is
an important distinction that greatly impacts how the results are interpreted.
line 145 - what is the error around these differences?
# look at figure 4.6
line 189 - I would recommend a more extensive discussion of the non-citation impact of scholarly
work, for policy, management, decision making, etc. Is there any evidence that the altmetric score
measure this? If not, is there something out there that does? If not, should there be?
line 216 - you mention earlier in the article that The Auk and the Condor have high pick up by the
news, would be good to mention them here as well, spread the focus to a wider set of journals
with a broader geographic spread.
line 213 - It would be good to include, though maybe not here, how a blog post is picked up by
altmetric. I assume there is something that must be done to make altmetric 'count' it and it would
be good to discuss what that is, and how it might bias results.
line 261 - must it be? what about science communication that is abusive, condesending and works
to further alienate people who are not trained as scientists? what about science communication
that advocates for unethical or immoral actions? I agree that much good can come from better
and wider communication of science, but to say that it is a universal good is overlooking a lot of
bad and harmful behaviour

green color blind, so please do not use both colors in figures. If you are making your graphs in R

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
I think the authors have identified an extremely interesting research question. As they state in their
discussion, the potential of using alt metrics as an early indicator of scholarly impact is very promising,
in particular given the lag between publication and citation count. As such, I deem the research question
to be timely and novel.
*RESPONSE* Thanks for the positive comments.
However, I feel that the results and the extent of their validity are rather limited. For instance, in the
analysis of the potential relationship between citations, journal impact factor and Altmetric score, there
is a very limited range both in terms of journal impact factor (which varies only between 0.5 and 2.5)
and citation count (which varies between 1 and 30).
*RESPONSE* Whilst we acknowledge that the within-sample variation in JIF and citation count is limited,
we have covered the full extent of ‘impact’ among ornithological journals. There are no specialist
ornithology journals with a 2015 impact factor above 2.5, and sampling additional journals would simply
add more journals towards the low end of the JIF scale. We have clarified the focus on ornithology
towards the end of introduction and stated that our findings “should not be extrapolated to broader
fields of research” (final paragraph of introduction). Nonetheless, the field of ornithology is larger than
just the 10 specialist ornithological journals previously considered; we have therefore included, for the
AAS vs citation analysis, data for an additional 323 ‘bird’- or ‘avian’-mentioning articles published in 15
generalist journals, with 2015 Journal Impact Factors ranging from 2.183 (PeerJ) to 9.423 (PNAS). Our
basic conclusions remain unchanged with this broader dataset; citation count and citation probability
increase with JIF and AAS. As hypothesised in our original submission, the effect of AAS weakens (to the
point of being statistically non-significant) for articles in the higher impact factor journal, suggesting that
articles in the most generalist journals are highly cited regardless of online activity.
Analogously, the effect of journal identity on AAS is basically non existent, given that it results in a
coefficient of determination of 0.08. The authors state that the effect is lower in this case, but I'd argue
that such a small coefficient of determination is not really indicative of any effect, despite the statistical
significance. `
*RESPONSE* We agree that this effect is small (as stated on original L119), and have modified this
paragraph to better reflect this (L139).
Also, the increase of AAS with publication year may simply suggest an increase in overall usage of online
tools to promote academic research.
*RESPONSE* We think this is exactly the mechanism behind this affect, and have clarified this in the
main text (L169).
I appreciate that it may be rather difficult to have a broader data set to analyse in a specialised field
such as ornithology, but I think that this is a major shortcoming of this manuscript.
All in all, the analysis in this article is performed accurately and rigorously, but in its current form the
manuscript is rather descriptive and with limited results, which in my opinion don't make a significant
contribution to the literature.
*RESPONSE* As described above, we have expanded our dataset to include ornithological articles
published outside of the specialist ornithological journals; this is about as broad a dataset as is possible
within our field. We appreciate that the field is narrow, but believe that our contribution will be of
interest to our community of researchers, as well as for those publishing in lower JIF journals (i.e. most
researchers, most of the time).

Comments to the Author(s)
This is an interesting look at what is not a simple problem of trying to measure the non-citation impact
of scholarly work. As ecology and especially ornithology continues to try and find a way to better
measure how our work influences the world I commend the authors for tackling this question. Overall I
found it to be a strong paper with interesting results, below are a few minor comments on places where
the text could be made more clear and a few notes on additional topics I think would benefit the paper
and help set it in the larger context.
*RESPONSE* Thanks for the positive comments.
line 15 - It would be informative to make this sentance more specific to communicating scientific
research. Since being able to communicate other parts of science via online tools would not lead us to be
interested in citation rates
*RESPONSE* Good point; this sentence has been rephrased slightly to highlight our specific focus on
scientific research specifically, as opposed to science in general.
line 34 - it might be helpful to define what falls under social media, are you counting blogs? are you
counting mass media coverage? Not all readers will know what does and does not fall in this category
and providing this baseline level would help them with the rest of the paper.
*RESPONSE* An accepted definition of ‘social media’ is a bit elusive, but we’ve reworded this sentence
to highlight the difference between ‘social media networks’ (e.g. Twitter) and blogging sites. The next
paragraph (L42) lists the platforms monitored by Altmetric, one of which is ‘social media networks’. We
have replaced careless instances of ‘social media’ with either ‘online media’ (generic) or ‘social media
networks’ (specific) throughout.
line 109 - What version of R and the 'lme4' package were used? Please report and cite.
*RESPONSE* Details of lme4 version (1.1-13) and a full citation for R (v3.4.0) have now been added to
the end of the methods section.
line 114 - Are the values here reported in the results section on the log scale, since some of the data
was transformed? or have the results been transformed back onto the original scale? This is an
important distinction that greatly impacts how the results are interpreted.
*RESPONSE* Thanks for bringing this lack of clarity to our attention. All results presented in the text are
untransformed. This has been emphasised in the text.
line 145 - what is the error around these differences?
# look at figure 4.6
*RESPONSE* We have added 95% (bootstrapped) confidence intervals to these predicted differences.
line 189 - I would recommend a more extensive discussion of the non-citation impact of scholarly work,
for policy, management, decision making, etc. Is there any evidence that the altmetric score measure
this? If not, is there something out there that does? If not, should there be?
*RESPONSE* Whilst we are just starting to detect impacts of AAS on scholarly impact, we suspect it will
take longer for AAS to be connected to these non-scholarly impacts, which are harder to measure (and
define) in the first place. We have extended this discussion as recommended (from L208).
line 216 - you mention earlier in the article that The Auk and the Condor have high pick up by the news,
would be good to mention them here as well, spread the focus to a wider set of journals with a broader
geographic spread.
*RESPONSE* We have referred to these American journals as suggested.
line 213 - It would be good to include, though maybe not here, how a blog post is picked up by
altmetric. I assume there is something that must be done to make altmetric 'count' it and it would be
good to discuss what that is, and how it might bias results.
*RESPONSE* We think this is probably beyond the scope of our paper, but any blog publisher can now
suggest a blog to be monitored by Altmetric, in addition to the long list of blogs they detect
automatically. Whilst it’s possible that some small blogs are not monitored, these (almost by definition)
are unlikely to be contributing much in terms of science communication.
line 261 - must it be? what about science communication that is abusive, condesending and works to
further alienate people who are not trained as scientists? what about science communication that
advocates for unethical or immoral actions? I agree that much good can come from better and wider
communication of science, but to say that it is a universal good is overlooking a lot of bad and harmful
behavior
*RESPONSE* We have now acknowledged that the impacts of social media are not universally positive
(L301), though our focus is on “communicating science” rather than social media in general; people
being abusive or condescending are not communicating science in the sense we are talking about here.
Figure 4 - Please choose a color blind friendly color scheme. 8% of the male population is red-green
color blind, so please do not use both colors in figures. If you are making your graphs in R the
RColorBrewer package can be quite helpful for this. Or the colorbrewer website -
http://colorbrewer2.org
*RESPONSE* Thanks for pointing this out. We have updated the figure with a better colour scheme
(from the viridis R package) – note that this figure has changed substantially following our response to
Reviewer 1.
You mention early in the article that the AAS doesn't differentiate between positive and critical attention.
This should be discussed more later in the paper.
*RESPONSE* We have added an additional section acknowledging the drawbacks of metrics such as AAS
(L274–291).
You pick AAS as your metric of choice without much discussion of other available options, I'm not sure
what all the available options are, but a short discussion of other metrics would be useful to the reader.
*RESPONSE* We have added a short section in the introduction which justifies our focus on the AAS
(L47). This is the ‘altmetric’ of choice among the major academic publishers in the sciences. Other
metrics might include number of pdf downloads, or number of mentions on a particular platform, but
these are usually available only for certain publishers (PLoS have many metrics, for example).
