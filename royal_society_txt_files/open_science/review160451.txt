This article characterises the behaviour of small groups of zebrafish in terms of their occupation
of an experimental tank and inter-individual distance. By comparing two different zebrafish
strains it finds that both tank occupancy and inter-individual distances are different for the two
strains.
Overall the analyses appear to be correct. The importance of these results is limited because the
two strains that are studied here already present manifest differences in their morphology and
arguably in their individual behaviour. For instance, I imagine that some aspects such as the
different attraction to the cylinders/shelters would also be exhibited by isolated fish and do not
really represent ‘collective’ phenomena. Also, fish from the two strains might quite likely swim at
different speed (because of the obvious morphological differences), and it is already known that
differences in speed can potentially determine a transition between shoaling and schooling (see
e.g. Gautrais et al. Plos Comp Biol 2012).
I would appreciate if the authors could point out how differences of collective behaviour between
strains emerge: do they result from differences in individual speed (which possibly could be
tested by changing water temperature?) or from stress level (which might be addressed by
comparing fish that have had more or less acclimatization time to the experimental arena? or by
artificially administering hormones?)
An alternative to experimental measures would be implementing the different values of
individual speed, attraction to conspecifics, etc. observed in the two strains in a simulation model
(I know that the authors have recently published a model of zebrafish shoaling which could quite
likely be adapted for this purpose) and vary the model parameters to obtain a cue about how
differences in collective behaviour arise. In conclusion, there would be several possible ways of
improving this manuscript with additional experiments or analyses, and I would personally
encourage the authors to follow some of these possibilities to produce a more well-rounded
article.
That said, in its present form the manuscript does present some useful descriptive results,
showing in particular that there are differences between the two considered zebrafish strains.
Unfortunately, these differences are difficult to summarize in terms of clear trends. For instance,
the probability of being close to the spots is higher for 10AB > 5AB > 5TL > 10TL indicating a
significant effect of zebrafish strain, but opposite effects of group size on the two strains. Also, TL
fish are less attracted by the spots, but appear to be closer to each-other, which is a bit surprising.
What was the composition of the shoals in terms of males and females? Did you observe any
chasing or fighting interactions in addition to shoaling? I could not find this information in the
manuscript.
Minor considerations:
I am not expert in statistics, but I think that most readers would benefit from the inclusion of a
specific section on the statistical analyses performed (e.g. in the methods). Different tests are
3
reported, some apparently based on individual data for each frame, some for which the data were
aggregated measures over the entire trial etc. For the figures were data from different trials are
aggregated (e.g. fig. 5 and 6) would it be possible to produce also error bars on the histograms
e.g. with some Monte Carlo method?
It is slightly surprising that while other plots indicate differences between AB and TL strains, the
number of majority events plotted in fig. 4A gives similar results for the two strains. Is it possible
that a large number of these ‘majority events’ are simply produced by fluctuations in the number
of fish around a spot mainly due to ‘noise’? E.g. if the number of fish close to a spot drops from 7
to 6 and then rises back to 7 as fish move around the border of the zone considered as ‘spot’ in the
analyses? How stable is this measure to different definitions of ‘majority’, such as e.g. having
N>=7 fish near the spot for say at least 70% of the last K frames? Or maybe it would be possible
to learn a hidden Markov model in which the hidden state is the position of the fish close to the
spot or away from it and the observations are tracking coordinates? Finally, how do these
measures count fish that remain undetected by the tracking software?
Caption of figure 2 ‘markes the mean’
Introduction, right column, line 39 ‘To quantify behavioural properties of the group, we use high
throughput ethology tools’. This appears as a bit of an overstatement to me: this article relies on
2D video-tracking and analysis of animal positions relative to each other and relative to
environmental heterogeneities, which is the basic standard procedure in (collective) animal
behaviour research.
In the copy of manuscript that I got for revision figure 9 is missing. Shouldn’t this have been
spotted during the initial quality check before sending out the manuscript to reviewers? Clearly I
cannot comment on this part of the manuscript.
The discussion starts with considerations about collective decision making. I see that in a sense in
these experiments fish are called to decide between two spots, but can we really talk about
collective decision making? At no time during the experiment the fish appear to select one spot
over the other (fig. 3), and it seems to me that apart from figure 3 (which is about one single trial)
all the other reported results and figures do not allow to see if there was a selection of one spot
over the other in individual experimental trials (because usually the data are reported as averages
of 10 different trials). Later in the discussion the fact that there was no collective choice of one
spot is stated explicitly (page 8, right column, second paragraph), but as I said above this point
had not clearly been illustrated in the results.
Discussion, final paragraph, in addition to studies on cockroaches and hymenoptera, there are
also studies on fish that examine oscillations from one site to another, e.g. Ward et al. Am. Nat.
2013, Harcourt et al. Curr. Biol. 2009 and other related papers. I do not claim that these studies are
necessarily relevant here, but I think that if a comparison has to be made with cockroaches and
ants, then studies on fish should also be mentioned.
Methods, section 5
Here the number of ‘positions’ is reported. In my first reading I found these numbers confusing (I
was expecting the number of video frames). I think it could be specified in the brackets that these
numbers result from 10 fish x 54000 video frames. By reading the rest of the manuscript we also
know that some positions were missing from the tracking, so that the actual number was
typically less than 54000 positions per fish: what was the percentage of accuracy? Were the
missing positions interpolated? How did these missing points contribute to group size measures
of figure 3 and figure 4?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The study by Séguret et al. aims to provide information on strain differences in collective
behavior of zebrafish, adding to our still-inadequate understanding of the species' social
behavior. However, there are few serious concerns about the methodology and this manuscript
requires significant improvement in terms of writing (clarity and organization), data presentation
and interpretation.
I have a number of comments for the authors to address:
Introduction:
There are quite a few redundancies among text that can be eliminated. For example, third
paragraph should be included under methods section. In general the whole manuscript could do
with a better organization of ideas.
From the way the study was written up, it suggests that the authors have no hypotheses, no prior
expectations with regards to the results. This manuscript could greatly benefit from developing
specific questions related to strain differences and preference for objects used in the study.
What is the reason for using cylinders and discs? Discs are supposed to provide shade but what
different physical attributes are expected to be altered by cylinders? You might want to elaborate
on this and this will be a good place to develop your hypotheses.
Make sure to cite relevant information in order to support your claims. For example, third
paragraph in the introduction: since zebrafish are known to swim along the walls…
It is true that cylinders could act as walls, but what if they also provide them landmarks or
function as reference points? You might want to include the alternative ways that these physical
structures may alter behavior (see Barreto et al., 2011, Suriyampola and Eason, 2015, Pettersson
and Brönmark, 1993). This information will help to strengthen the introduction.
5
Methods:
Fish housing and husbandry: Line 6: Missing “zebrafish” before the Latin name
What is the reason for using 9:15 day: night light cycle? Zebrafish naturally occur in the Indian
subcontinent and they typically experience 12:12 or 14:10 day: night cycle.
Did rearing tanks have any physically distinctive structures that they may have used as
landmarks or for refuge? This important to mentioned as their previous experience in rearing
environment is likely to influence their behavior in a novel testing arena.
Experimental setup: Line 6: water parameters are already provided in the previous section.
Minimize repeating same information.
As zebrafish are capable of color vision (e.g. Avdesh et al. 2012, Risner 2006), how would you
explain the impact of color differences of cylinders and discs on the observed behavioral
patterns? How can you determine that they are attracted to the structure but not to the specific
color of the structure? Would you expect a different pattern if you had used the same color in
cylinders and discs? You may want to discuss these in the Discussion section.
Experimental procedure: Line 10: combination of parameters
Tracking and data analysis: Line 8: were difficult to distinguish by the program
Results and Figures:
Provide degrees of freedom of F statistics (e.g. F1,70 = 3.59, P = 0.07) for 2-way ANOVA results.
Presenting raw data is helpful for visualization but does not strengthen this manuscript. Figure 1,
3, 7 and 8 can be easily incorporated into text of the Results section.
Figure legends are unnecessarily long. Most of the text included in legends is merely a repetition
of results.
Figure 5: Legend mentions average inter-individual distances but in the text of the Results section
provide only median values. Presenting both average and median values are not improving the
manuscript.
Plotting median values for each strain and group size in one figure may improve the data
presentation in figure 5.
Figure 9 was unable to view.
Discussion:
This manuscript can greatly benefit by reorganizing the discussion. For example, the first eight
lines of the second paragraph should be under Methods section.
Providing possible explanations for the observed behavioral patterns may strengthen the
discussion. For example, discuss why AB strain could be more attracted to the heterogeneity and
6
how that will be influenced by the formation of less cohesive groups or vice versa. Do you think
the habitat differences in their source populations may have attributed to these differences?
What is the basis for assuming that the visual acuity and lateral line performance are not same in
these populations? Many recent studies (Bhat et al. 2015; Suriyampola et al. 2016, etc.) suggest
that there are many population level variations in zebrafish behavior that could be potentially
attributed to physiological mechanisms. Thus discussing how your observed patterns will be
affected by different visual acuity and lateral line performance is more interesting than
developing an unrealistic assumption.
Explain how big the differences in fin sizes are between these two strains. That information
should be provided in the Methods section when mentioning morphological differences of these
two strains.
How would you explain the effect of density on shoal cohesion? In groups of 10, the density is
higher compared to groups of 5 and dense groups are more likely to form cohesive groups than
less dense groups.
One hour is still a limited time period (6th paragraph in the Discussion). You may want to
rephrase this statement.

This article characterises the behaviour of small groups of zebrafish in terms of their occupation

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
In their Answer #2 the authors discuss the possible effects of speed. They measured speed for
isolated fish finding no difference (though the published literature indicates that the speed of AB
and TL can be significantly different).
They also say that they did not measure speed in groups of 5 or 10 because their tracking does
not allow to keep trace of the identity. However it should be possible to provide estimates of
average speed for an entire group: the simplest tracking method, consisting in matching the
coordinates of each fish at frame t with the closest coordinates at frame t+1 is not accurate in
tracking the identity of fish, but is quite accurate in estimating speed (identities swap when two
fish overlap, but precisely because fish are overlapping measures of average speed remain
reliable: If fish 1 takes positions A -> O -> B and fish 2 takes positions C -> O -> D, the average
length of the paths of the two fish remains the same when switching B and D).
Alternatively, it should be possible to select randomly one fish from each shoal and track it
manually, say for one minute every ten minutes, to get more reliable coordinates from which to
obtain an estimation of speed.
Figure 6 (and possibly other figures): would it be possible to provide for comparison (as
supplementary material) the distances to be expected in the absence of interactions (calculated
from the distributions of 5 and 10 randomly distributed points in a square arena of the same size
as the experimental one.
Most figures present the aggregate data from 10 trials. This hides some of the variability from
trial to trial (see e.g. trial 1 vs. trial 4 in fig. S6) and within one single trial (fig. S11 shows that the
inter-individual distance increases by at least 50% on average in each trial). It is not always clear
from the figure caption that the figure represents aggregate data. For instance, in figure 2 my first
guess was that each box plot represents 10 values of probability (one for each trial), but this is
probably not the case. The same for other figures.
In my opinion fig 3 could be only supplementary.
Check the grammar:
‘markes’
‘dependant’
‘significative difference’
‘a detailed analysis show’
‘moving in groups first of all prevents the fish to be static preys’
From what I understand, the supplementary heatmaps indicate the probability to find a fish at a
given position, not the probability for a randomly selected fish to be at a given position. This
creates some apparent differences of concentration between groups of 5 and 10 fish. Perhaps the
color scale for 5 fish could go from 0 to 6x10^-3 instead of 0 to 12x10^-3 as with the groups of 10?

In their Answer #2 the authors discuss the possible effects of speed. They measured speed for
isolated fish finding no difference (though the published literature indicates that the speed of AB
and TL can be significantly different).
They also say that they did not measure speed in groups of 5 or 10 because their tracking does
not allow to keep trace of the identity. However it should be possible to provide estimates of
average speed for an entire group: the simplest tracking method, consisting in matching the
coordinates of each fish at frame t with the closest coordinates at frame t+1 is not accurate in
tracking the identity of fish, but is quite accurate in estimating speed (identities swap when two
fish overlap, but precisely because fish are overlapping measures of average speed remain
reliable: If fish 1 takes positions A -> O -> B and fish 2 takes positions C -> O -> D, the average
length of the paths of the two fish remains the same when switching B and D).
Alternatively, it should be possible to select randomly one fish from each shoal and track it
manually, say for one minute every ten minutes, to get more reliable coordinates from which to
obtain an estimation of speed.
Figure 6 (and possibly other figures): would it be possible to provide for comparison (as
supplementary material) the distances to be expected in the absence of interactions (calculated
from the distributions of 5 and 10 randomly distributed points in a square arena of the same size
as the experimental one.
Most figures present the aggregate data from 10 trials. This hides some of the variability from
trial to trial (see e.g. trial 1 vs. trial 4 in fig. S6) and within one single trial (fig. S11 shows that the
inter-individual distance increases by at least 50% on average in each trial). It is not always clear
from the figure caption that the figure represents aggregate data. For instance, in figure 2 my first
guess was that each box plot represents 10 values of probability (one for each trial), but this is
probably not the case. The same for other figures.
In my opinion fig 3 could be only supplementary.
Check the grammar:
‘markes’
‘dependant’
16
‘significative difference’
‘a detailed analysis show’
‘moving in groups first of all prevents the fish to be static preys’
From what I understand, the supplementary heatmaps indicate the probability to find a fish at a
given position, not the probability for a randomly selected fish to be at a given position. This
creates some apparent differences of concentration between groups of 5 and 10 fish. Perhaps the
color scale for 5 fish could go from 0 to 6x10^-3 instead of 0 to 12x10^-3 as with the groups of 10?

See Appendix D.
Reviewer 1:
Comment #1:
The importance of these results is limited because the two strains that are studied
here already present manifest differences in their morphology and arguably in their
ndividual behaviour. For instance, I imagine that some aspects such as the different
attraction to the cylinders/shelters would also be exhibited by isolated fish and do not
eally represent ‘collective’ phenomena. Also, fish from the two strains might quite
ikely swim at different speed (because of the obvious morphological differences),
and it is already known that differences in speed can potentially determine a
ransition between shoaling and schooling (see e.g. Gautrais et al. Plos Comp Biol
2012).
Answer #1:
The two strains have a morphological difference that can result in different swimming
performances (the mean critical speed of wild-type short-fin zebrafish reaches 56.0 ±
4.8 cm.s-1 when it is only 43.7 ± 6.8 cm.s-1 for long-finned zebrafish; Plaut, 2000).
However, our results highlight that the behavioral differences that we observed are
group-size dependent. Indeed, groups of 5 AB and 5 TL show similar response to the
presence of cylinders but this attraction is enhanced in groups of 10 AB while it
decreases in groups of 10 TL. Thus, we show that the behavioral differences do not
esults only from morphological differences but also from the collective interaction
among the fish.
Comment #2:
would appreciate if the authors could point out how differences of collective
behaviour between strains emerge: do they result from differences in individual
speed (which possibly could be tested by changing water temperature?) or from
stress level (which might be addressed by comparing fish that have had more or less
acclimatization time to the experimental arena? or by artificially administering
hormones?)
An alternative to experimental measures would be implementing the different values
of individual speed, attraction to conspecifics, etc. observed in the two strains in a
simulation model (I know that the authors have recently published a model of
zebrafish shoaling which could quite likely be adapted for this purpose) and vary the
model parameters to obtain a cue about how differences in collective behaviour arise.
n conclusion, there would be several possible ways of improving this manuscript with
additional experiments or analyses, and I would personally encourage the authors to
ollow some of these possibilities to produce a more well-rounded article.
Answer #2:
The experimental procedure and the rearing conditions were identical for both
strains. The AB and TL zebrafish are raised in tanks of 60 L. In each tank, there are
50 zebrafish of one of the two strains. Both strains were fed at the same time. The
difference of behavior is thus not dependent of the stress level of the fish due to a
differential treatment during the procedure.
The tracking system that we have developed gives the positions of the fish without
keeping their identity. Therefore, it is impossible to extract the individual positions and
calculate individual speeds or other individual features. Nevertheless, we observed
10 zebrafish of each strain swimming alone in a bare square tank (10 experiments of
1 hour each). We compared the mean speed of fish from both strain and found no
est, n1 = 10, n2 = 10, p > 0.05). Thus, the results that we observe do not seem to
esult from a different speed of the individual but rather from a different preference of
each strain for their congeners or the environmental spots. While it is true that we
have recently published a model inspired by the collective behaviour of AB zebrafish,
his model cannot be directly applied to the present situation since it does not include
he interaction between the fish and physical objects in the water column like the
cylinders (the model was only developed to describe AB zebrafish swimming in the
absence of floating disks). Including a new type of interaction would require specific
analysis around the cylinders at the collective but also individual level that go beyond
he scope of this experimental paper.
Comment #3:
That said, in its present form the manuscript does present some useful descriptive
esults, showing in particular that there are differences between the two considered
zebrafish strains. Unfortunately, these differences are difficult to summarize in terms
of clear trends. For instance, the probability of being close to the spots is higher for
10AB > 5AB > 5TL > 10TL indicating a significant effect of zebrafish strain, but
opposite effects of group size on the two strains. Also, TL fish are less attracted by
he spots, but appear to be closer to each other, which is a bit surprising.
Answer #3:
As you mention it, we observed an opposite effect of the group size on the collective
esponse to the spots by the strains. This observation is a key result that
demonstrates the strain-specific collective behaviour of the zebrafish. We tried to
clarify this message by modifying the discussion about the response of the two
strains to spots and to conspecifics.
Comment #4:
What was the composition of the shoals in terms of males and females? Did you
observe any chasing or fighting interactions in addition to shoaling?
Answer #4:
The groups of zebrafish were randomly formed at the beginning of the experiments
by selecting fish from the rearing tanks. We did not see chasing or fighting
nteractions. Similarly, we did not observe the emergence of territoriality during the
one-hour observation period.
Comment #5:
am not expert in statistics, but I think that most readers would benefit from the
nclusion of a specific section on the statistical analyses performed (e.g. in the
methods). Different tests are reported, some apparently based on individual data for
each frame, some for which the data were aggregated measures over the entire trial
etc. For the figures were data from different trials are aggregated (e.g. fig. 5 and 6)
would it be possible to produce also error bars on the histograms e.g. with some
Monte Carlo method?
Answer #5:
We added a specific section in the Methods about statistical analysis. In the figure
showing the distribution of the inter-individual distances, the distributions are not the
mean of the distributions of each experiment but are distributions of all inter-individual
distances pooled together. Therefore, we cannot produce an error bar on these
distributions.
Comment #6:
t is slightly surprising that while other plots indicate differences between AB and TL
strains, the number of majority events plotted in fig. 4A gives similar results for the
wo strains. Is it possible that a large number of these ‘majority events’ are simply
produced by fluctuations in the number of fish around a spot mainly due to ‘noise’?
E.g. if the number of fish close to a spot drops from 7 to 6 and then rises back to 7 as
ish move around the border of the zone considered as ‘spot’ in the analyses? How
stable is this measure to different definitions of ‘majority’, such as e.g. having N>=7
ish near the spot for say at least 70% of the last K frames? Or maybe it would be
possible to learn a hidden Markov model in which the hidden state is the position of
he fish close to the spot or away from it and the observations are tracking
coordinates? Finally, how do these measures count fish that remain undetected by
he tracking software?
Answer #6:
To compute these figures, the data were interpolated over 5 successive frames.
Following your advice to compute the number of majority events, the number of fish
was average over the 15 frames of every seconds. This operation guaranties that a
majority event is ended by the departure of a fish and not by an error of detection
during one or two frames by the tracking system. In the supplementary material, we
added figures S9 and S10 which show the proportions of majority event according to
heir duration for 10 AB and 10 TL zebrafish swimming in the presence of two
cylinders. Thus, by interpolating the data over 1 second we strongly decrease the
noise comparing to non-interpolated data. However, the results obtained after 15-
rames interpolation differ only in one case (the number of majority events near the
cylinder 1 is now significantly smaller for the TL strain) from the results obtained after
he 5-frames interpolations. We added the details of this computation in the Methods
section.
Comment #7:
ntroduction, right column, line 39 ‘To quantify behavioural properties of the group, we
use high throughput ethology tools’. This appears as a bit of an overstatement to me:
his article relies on 2D video-tracking and analysis of animal positions relative to
each other and relative to environmental heterogeneities, which is the basic standard
procedure in (collective) animal behaviour research.
Answer #7:
We modified the introduction and removed this sentence.
Comment #8:
n the copy of manuscript that I got for revision figure 9 is missing. Shouldn’t this have
been spotted during the initial quality check before sending out the manuscript to
eviewers? Clearly I cannot comment on this part of the manuscript.
Answer #8:
We apologize for the inconvenience and we make sure that all figures will be
available in the revised manuscript.
Comment #9:
The discussion starts with considerations about collective decision making. I see that
n a sense in these experiments fish are called to decide between two spots, but can
we really talk about collective decision making? At no time during the experiment the
rom figure 3 (which is about one single trial) all the other reported results and figures
do not allow to see if there was a selection of one spot over the other in individual
experimental trials (because usually the data are reported as averages of 10 different
rials). Later in the discussion the fact that there was no collective choice of one spot
s stated explicitly (page 8, right column, second paragraph), but as I said above this
point had not clearly been illustrated in the results.
Answer #9:
We modified the introduction and the discussion to refocus the manuscript on
collective decisions. In particular, we discuss the time scale of these processes and
he duration of the choices. As you pointed out and as shown by our results, the
zebrafish are often observed together at the same place but regularly transit from one
o another. Therefore, we developed a new paragraph about collective decision
making that happens at local time and not at global time (the whole experiment). We
also added in the supplementary material figures S1 to S8. Figures S1 to S6 show
probabilities of presence of 5 AB, 10 AB, 5 TL and 10 TL with cylinders or disks.
Figure S7 and S8 are time series of the spot occupancy for 10 trials with 10 AB and
10 trials with 10 TL zebrafish.
Comment #10:
Discussion, final paragraph, in addition to studies on cockroaches and hymenoptera,
here are also studies on fish that examine oscillations from one site to another, e.g.
Ward et al. Am. Nat. 2013, Harcourt et al. Curr. Biol. 2009 and other related papers. I
do not claim that these studies are necessarily relevant here, but I think that if a
comparison has to be made with cockroaches and ants, then studies on fish should
also be mentioned.
Answer #10:
We added the suggested papers in the discussion.
Comment #11:
Methods, section 5 Here the number of ‘positions’ is reported. In my first reading I
ound these numbers confusing (I was expecting the number of video frames). I think
t could be specified in the brackets that these numbers result from 10 fish x 54000
video frames. By reading the rest of the manuscript we also know that some positions
were missing from the tracking, so that the actual number was typically less than
54000 positions per fish: what was the percentage of accuracy? Were the missing
positions interpolated? How did these missing points contribute to group size
measures of figure 3 and figure 4?
Answer #11:
We added a table in the Methods with the average tracking efficiency for all
experiments. All positions were detected in the experiments with the floating disks.
On the contrary, we only used the automated tracking system in the experiments with
cylinders. The missing positions were not interpolated to compute the different inter-
ndividual distances. However, to compute the number of majority events, the number
of fish was averaged over the 15 frames of every seconds. This operation guaranties
hat a majority event is ended by the departure of a fish and not by an error of
Methods section 5 to give these details to the reader.
Reviewer 2:
Comment #12:
What is the reason for using cylinders and discs? Discs are supposed to provide
shade but what different physical attributes are expected to be altered by cylinders?
You might want to elaborate on this and this will be a good place to develop your
hypotheses.
Answer #12:
The disks lying on the surface of the water simulate floating objects and cylinders
standing in the water column simulate the presence of an object in the water. The
cylinders were coloured according to the visual response of zebrafish to colours. We
mproved our introduction to give a better explanation for these choices.
Comment #13:
t is true that cylinders could act as walls, but what if they also provide them
andmarks or function as reference points? You might want to include the alternative
ways that these physical structures may alter behavior (see Barreto et al., 2011,
Suriyampola and Eason, 2015, Pettersson and Brönmark, 1993). This information will
help to strengthen the introduction.
Answer #13:
We improved our manuscript by adding this information and the references in our
ntroduction.
Comment #14:
What is the reason for using 9:15 day: night light cycle? Zebrafish naturally occur in
he Indian subcontinent and they typically experience 12:12 or 14:10 day: night cycle.
Did rearing tanks have any physically distinctive structures that they may have used
as landmarks or for refuge? This important to mentioned as their previous experience
n rearing environment is likely to influence their behavior in a novel testing arena.
Answer #14:
The zebrafish used for these experiments were adults obtained from the Institut Curie
of Paris (France) and we kept them in the same environmental conditions and light
cycle to not perturb them. Concerning the rearing tanks, the only structure present in
he aquarium was the water pump and the tanks were exactly the same for both
zebrafish strains.
Comment #15:
As zebrafish are capable of color vision (e.g. Avdesh et al. 2012, Risner 2006), how
would you explain the impact of color differences of cylinders and disks on the
observed behavioral patterns? How can you determine that they are attracted to the
structure but not to the specific color of the structure? Would you expect a different
pattern if you had used the same color in cylinders and discs? You may want to
discuss these in the Discussion section.
Answer #15:
The blue colour of the disks provided as sufficiently dark area to attract the fish but
was enough transparent to distinct the fish. The colours of the cylinders were chosen
green colours. We added this information in the manuscript. The different responses
of the two strains to the spots could result from a different perception of the colours
by the two strains. However, as more developed in our response to the comment
#17, the two genes that differ in the two tested strains are responsible for the pattern
of the skin (spotted versus zebra) and the length of the fins. Therefore, we assume
hat a differential visual perception of the colours was less likely to explain our
esults.
Comment #16:
Presenting raw data is helpful for visualization but does not strengthen this
manuscript. Figure 1, 3, 7 and 8 can be easily incorporated into text of the Results
section.
Answer #16:
The figures 1 and 8 show quantifications of the probability of presence of the fish in
he experimental arena and highlight the differences in the response of the strains to
he spots. As these figures present a spatial information, we thing that it is important
or the reader to visualize them. Similarly, the Figure 3 show the temporal evolution of
he experiment and we think that it is important for the reader to see the dynamics of
an experiment. However, Figure 7 has been incorporated in the supplementary
materials of the revised version.
Comment #17:
Providing possible explanations for the observed behavioral patterns may strengthen
he discussion. For example, discuss why AB strain could be more attracted to the
heterogeneity and how that will be influenced by the formation of less cohesive
groups or vice versa. Do you think the habitat differences in their source populations
may have attributed to these differences?
What is the basis for assuming that the visual acuity and lateral line performance are
not same in these populations? Many recent studies (Bhat et al. 2015; Suriyampola
et al. 2016, etc.) suggest that there are many population level variations in zebrafish
behavior that could be potentially attributed to physiological mechanisms. Thus
discussing how your observed patterns will be affected by different visual acuity and
ateral line performance is more interesting than developing an unrealistic
assumption.
Answer #17:
Concerning the habitat differences of the two strains, our AB and TL zebrafish were
born and raised in a laboratory under the same conditions, in tanks of 60 L by groups
of 50. In addition, the two strains are very close since they only differ by two genetic
mutations.
Likewise, we supposed that referee 2 means: “What is the basis for assuming that
he visual acuity and lateral line performance are not same in these populations?” as
we stated in our discussion that “Starting from the assumptions that AB and TL
zebrafish have the same visual acuity and the same lateral line performance, the only
source of separation between both strains are their fin lengths.”
To strengthen our manuscript, we improved the discussion by giving more details on
he differences between AB and TL zebrafish. The TL zebrafish are homozygous for
eot1 and lofdt2 genes. leot1 is a recessive mutation causing spotting in adult fish, also
known as tup. lofdt2 is a dominant homozygous viable mutation causing long fins.
2006) and on the zebrafish data base zfin
https://zfin.org/action/genotype/view/ZDB-GENO-990623-2). In addition, we
developed a new paragraph in our manuscript to discuss the possible preference for
congeners versus landmarks since TL zebrafish are more cohesive and less present
around spots than AB zebrafish. We evaluate also the risks and the ecological
benefits of such preferences.
Comment #18:
Explain how big the differences in fin sizes are between these two strains. That
nformation should be provided in the Methods section when mentioning
morphological differences of these two strains.
Answer #18:
The caudal fin size of AB zebrafish is about 0.4 cm and for TL zebrafish it is about
1.1 cm. We added this information in the Material and Methods.
Comment #19:
How would you explain the effect of density on shoal cohesion? In groups of 10, the
density is higher compared to groups of 5 and dense groups are more likely to form
cohesive groups than less dense groups.
One hour is still a limited time period (6th paragraph in the Discussion).
Answer #19:
We noticed that shoal cohesion is strain specific and group size dependent. TL
zebrafish are more cohesive than AB zebrafish (shown in Figures 5, 6 and 9). This
esult is now discussed in terms of a higher preference for the proximity of congeners
- potentially by a stronger perception of their presence -- than for the provided
andmarks for the TL strain. Concerning the time period, we agree that 1 hour is still a
imited period from an ecological point of view, but comparing to the recent literature,
t represents a quite long period of observation. We added a detailed comparison
with other studies in our manuscript.

hough the manuscript has been greatly improved in the revised version, reorganizing the
oduction, results and discussion can greatly benefit this manuscript. Main findings of this
rk are the strain differences and group size effects on the preference for landmarks. Currently,
introduction does little to highlight the merit of this work and mentions the effect of group
at a minimal. Developing the manuscript around these two findings will highlight and
ver the significance of this work more affluently.

hough authors prefer to highlight the fact that they collected behavioral data for one hour,
ch is longer than what other studies have done, the true merit of this work is that they test
ective behavior in heterogeneous habitats between two strains. Thus, arrange the introduction
hat it highlights the biological significance of this work. First, giving a general description of
ective decisions, second mentioning how habitat conditions may impact it and then
cussing the impact of group size may provide a better structure to the introduction. As you
ed the group size effect, make sure to include it in the introduction.
para, line 35: In the wild, there is a wide variability in shoal sizes of zebrafish. They form
all shoals (Pritchard et al.2001) but may also aggregate into large groups consisting of about
individuals (Suriyampola et al. 2016). This variability in shoal sizes, in fact, provides a nice
logy for this study as one of the goals of this study is to investigate the effect of group size.
s, you can ask the question whether collective decisions will be affected by the group size or
decisions of small groups are different from that of large groups. In addition, the natural
mming habitats are not essentially open environments as mentioned here. Zebrafish occur in
ariety of habitats with varying structural complexities (See Arunachalam et al. 2014 and
iyampola et al. 2016 for more information). You may use this information to enhance the
logical relevance of your study as you are testing their collective decisions in heterogeneous
itats.

ourage authors to rearrange the presentation of results in a more meaningful manner.
cussion:
ddition to using morphological differences to explain the cohesiveness of TL, did authors
ice any behavioral differences, particularly in aggression, between these two strains? If not,
ng examples from other studies or species, you should discuss how aggression might
uence the cohesiveness of the shoal. Discuss whether there could be any difference in the
dness/shyness between two strains that might lead to the observed differences in social
amics. Also, discuss how the sensory ability to detect social cues may shape the cohesion and
er social dynamics.
th majority events, you could discuss group fission and fusion effect to strengthen the
cussion.
ing other studies, authors should discuss whether site fidelity can arise after a longer time
iod, such as 24 hours or weeks. It is possible that after one hour they are still in the process of
iding the preferred structure.
Reviewer 1:
Comment #1:
n their Answer #2 the authors discuss the possible effects of speed. They measured
peed for isolated fish finding no difference (though the published literature indicates
hat the speed of AB and TL can be significantly different). They also say that they did
not measure speed in groups of 5 or 10 because their tracking does not allow to keep
race of the identity. However it should be possible to provide estimates of average
peed for an entire group: the simplest tracking method, consisting in matching the
oordinates of each fish at frame t with the closest coordinates at frame t+1 is not
accurate in tracking the identity of fish, but is quite accurate in estimating speed
identities swap when two fish overlap, but precisely because fish are overlapping
measures of average speed remain reliable: If fish 1 takes positions A -> O -> B and
ish 2 takes positions C -> O -> D, the average length of the paths of the two fish
emains the same when switching B and D).
Alternatively, it should be possible to select randomly one fish from each shoal and
rack it manually, say for one minute every ten minutes, to get more reliable coordinates
rom which to obtain an estimation of speed.
Answer #1:
n the previous answer to the reviewers, we point no significant effect of the strain on
he mean speed of the individuals (Wilcoxon rank test, n1 = 10, n2 = 10, p > 0.05) out.
Also in this paper we did not focus on speeds of the fish because we would like to show
differences of preferences for landmarks and differences of collective structures with
he more accurate results.
Comment #2:
Figure 6 (and possibly other figures): would it be possible to provide for comparison
as supplementary material) the distances to be expected in the absence of
nteractions (calculated from the distributions of 5 and 10 randomly distributed points
n a square arena of the same size as the experimental one.
Answer #2:
Following the advices of reviewer 1, we computed the distribution of inter-individual
distances, the distribution average inter-individual distances and the probability of
presence of 5 and 10 randomly distributed points in two different square arenas (1m x
1m and 1.20m x 1.20m). We added Figures S12, S13 and S14 of the supplementary
materials.
Comment #3:
Most figures present the aggregate data from 10 trials. This hides some of the
ariability from trial to trial (see e.g. trial 1 vs. trial 4 in fig. S6) and within one single
rial (fig. S11 shows that the inter-individual distance increases by at least 50% on
average in each trial). It is not always clear from the figure caption that the figure
epresents aggregate data. For instance, in figure 2 my first guess was that each box
plot represents 10 values of probability (one for each trial), but this is probably not the
ase. The same for other figures.
We will precise in the legends of the figures if they are based on aggregated data
adding the mention “for 10 trials”. In figure 2 each boxplot represents 10 values of
probability.
Comment #4:
n my opinion fig 3 could be only supplementary.
Check the grammar: ‘markes’, ‘dependant’, ‘significative, difference’, ‘a detailed
analysis show’, ‘moving in groups first of all prevents the fish to be static preys’.
Answer #4:
Fig. 3 has been removed of the article and is part of the Fig. S7-S8.
Comment #5:
From what I understand, the supplementary heatmaps indicate the probability to find a
ish at a given position, not the probability for a randomly selected fish to be at a given
position. This creates some apparent differences of concentration between groups of
5 and 10 fish. Perhaps the color scale for 5 fish could go from 0 to 6x10^-3 instead of
0 to 12x10^-3 as with the groups of 10?
Answer #5:
The supplementary heatmaps show exactly what the reviewer 1 is saying. For the
convenience of the reader and to ease the understanding and the comparison between
hese figures, we prefer to keep the same order of magnitude.
Reviewer 2:
Comment #6:
Although the manuscript has been greatly improved in the revised version,
eorganizing the introduction, results and discussion can greatly benefit this
manuscript. Main findings of this work are the strain differences and group size effects
on the preference for landmarks. Currently, the introduction does little to highlight the
merit of this work and mentions the effect of group size at a minimal. Developing the
manuscript around these two findings will highlight and deliver the significance of this
work more affluently.
ntroduction:
2nd paragraph, line 38: Avoid using the term ‘nomad’. It is very general, loose term and
does not improve the context discussed here. Or, provide a reference that suggests
zebrafish are nomadic. In the wild, generally, zebrafish shoals do display site fidelity
except during monsoons.
Although authors prefer to highlight the fact that they collected behavioral data for one
hour, which is longer than what other studies have done, the true merit of this work is
hat they test collective behavior in heterogeneous habitats between two strains. Thus,
arrange the introduction so that it highlights the biological significance of this work.
First, giving a general description of collective decisions, second mentioning how
habitat conditions may impact it and then discussing the impact of group size may
provide a better structure to the introduction. As you tested the group size effect, make
sure to include it in the introduction.
4th para, line 35: In the wild, there is a wide variability in shoal sizes of zebrafish. They
orm small shoals (Pritchard et al. 2001) but may also aggregate into large groups
consisting of about 300 individuals (Suriyampola et al. 2016). This variability in shoal
sizes, in fact, provides a nice analogy for this study as one of the goals of this study is
collective decisions will be affected by the group size or the decisions of small groups
are different from that of large groups. In addition, the natural swimming habitats are
not essentially open environments as mentioned here. Zebrafish occur in a variety of
habitats with varying structural complexities (See Arunachalam et al. 2014 and
Suriyampola et al. 2016 for more information). You may use this information to
enhance the biological relevance of your study as you are testing their collective
decisions in heterogeneous habitats.

Paragraph 6 is redundant, and most of this information should be included under the
methods section.
Answer #6:
We reorganized the introduction following your advices.
We did not find references about nomadism of zebrafish and removed the assertion
on nomadic species.
We include a new part in the introduction talking about group sizes effects on moving
eatures and behaviours. It appears that Becco et al., Herbert-Read et al. and Tunstrom
et al. found that the group sizes influence speed, turning speed, nearest neighbour
distance following the same patterns for different species. Finally the authors found
different results for the alignments, increasing the group size of Oreochromis niloticus
makes stronger alignments when for Notemigonus crysoleucas they decrease.
We add some citations about natural group sizes and natural habitats of zebrafish.
We removed redundant parts of the introduction as you pointed it out.
Comment #7:
Methods:
Page 18, line 41: When measuring the distance from fish to landmark, did you use the
distance to each individual fish and averaged it, or considered the distance to the
midpoint of the group? Please clarify.
Table 1 should be listed as a supplementary data.
Results: You might want to consider rearranging data to highlight the effect of strain
and group size on collective decisions than arranging them by cylinder and disc
reatments. For example: effects of group size on collective decisions, group size affect
he strains’ preference for landmarks differently, shoal cohesion is strain-dependent in
heterogeneous habitats, or preference for landmarks differs between strains. These
are only suggestions, but I seriously encourage authors to rearrange the presentation
of results in a more meaningful manner.
Answer #7:
When measuring the distance from fish to landmark, we calculated the distance
between each individual fish and the attractive landmarks and averaged it.
Table 1 has been moved in the Supplementary materials.
We rearrange the results part. We created two sections: “Differences of group features
between AB and TL strains of zebrafish” and “Group sizes affect strain preferences for
andmarks”. For this occasion, we created a new figure (4) that shows the distributions
of the average inter-individual distances for 10 AB and 10 TL zebrafish in the presence
of the disks. This figure strengthens the previous analysis.
Comment #8:
n addition to using morphological differences to explain the cohesiveness of TL, did
authors notice any behavioral differences, particularly in aggression, between these
wo strains? If not, taking examples from other studies or species, you should discuss
how aggression might influence the cohesiveness of the shoal. Discuss whether there
could be any difference in the boldness/shyness between two strains that might lead
o the observed differences in social dynamics. Also, discuss how the sensory ability
o detect social cues may shape the cohesion and other social dynamics.
With majority events, you could discuss group fission and fusion effect to strengthen
he discussion.
Citing other studies, authors should discuss whether site fidelity can arise after a longer
ime period, such as 24 hours or weeks. It is possible that after one hour they are still
n the process of deciding the preferred structure.
Answer #8:
The discussion has been improved. We deepened the part about shy and bold
personalities as you suggested.
We did not find enough aggression behaviours during the experiments to quantify
hem. However, Morgan et al. show that aggressive interactions decrease as shoal
size increases for Pimephales notatus when Rehnberg et al. report that there is no
clear evidence between levels of aggression and shoal size with zebrafish.
We add the idea of group fusion and group fission in the discussion, when talking about
ransitions and majority events.
Finally, we found several articles about site fidelity for longer time periods for different
species (Brousseau et al., Katrak et al., Wolfe et al., Thorrold et al.). Although crabs
and fish do not show high site fidelity for more than few days it has been evidenced a
strong link between birth location of the parents and their spawning location for some
species of fish as well as territorial behaviours during spawning for zebrafish.

Reviewer 2 :
Comment #1:
Please address how differences in visual and lateral line performance may affect the strain differences
n behavior (page 13: Lines 53-55) rather than using it as an assumption. For example, fish with poor
ensory performance may form less cohesive groups. You can expand on this and use it to explain
ome of the observed strain differences.
Answer #1:
We add to the hypotheses of intrinsic preferences and performances of the fins, the hypotheses of the
izes of the visual fields and the performances of the lateral lines of the two strains of zebrafish. On
he one hand, we followed the results of Hemmings (1966) and Partridge (1980) showing that fish use
vision for attraction and the lateral line for repulsion and of Pita (2015) showing that the visual field
binocular and lateral) modify the group cohesion. We discussed about the fact that the strain showing
he bigger visual field should be less cohesive. On the other hand, we build our hypothesis of lateral
ine performances on the same articles (Hemmings and Partridge). The lateral line performances
between the two strains may be different due to leo mutation and could explain why TL zebrafish are
more cohesive.
Comment #2:
Use better terminology:
moving features (Page 7: Line 27)
natural group sizes (Page 7: Line 41) What does a "natural group size" mean?
Punctually (Page11: Line 49) Does not fit with the context mentioned here
Remove L. (indicating Linnaeus described the species) from the scientific name (Page 7: Line 32)
Add "strain" too (Page 7: Line 37)
Redundant (Page 11: Lines 37-46)
Not connected to the rest of the text (Page 12: Lines 44-46)
Answer #2:
Minor corrections have been made using better terminologies and removing a redundant part.
