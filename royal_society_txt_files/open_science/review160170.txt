Congratulations on this interesting insight.
This is a novel approach to CO2 budgets related to fossil and living bivalves in a river delta.
These moluscs have been studied for some time now by at least one of the authors, focusing on
the impact river damming had on their abundance and distribution. Now, some gross but well
explained and useful estimates are given for the role Mulinia Coloradoensis had in the net input
of CO2 to the atmosphere, prior to population decrease due to the lack of freshwater flows.
I only suggest two changes:
1) In lines 197 and 198, when the emissions of total carbon are compared with he power station,
use also mol C to facilitate comparison wit estimates for bivalve CO2 emissions.
2) From line 202 the arguments seem highly speculative, although informative. At least in lines
223-226 the authors should, in my opinion, better explain the closing new and complex
terminology such as: benefits, most option value, reversibility, social priorities.... if possible to
keep in context with the actual scientific conclusions of the manuscript, which focuses in a section
of the Colorado River lower basin. I mean... can the CO2 budgets and social priorities etc. be
assessed for that specific basin in further detail? Have there other CO2 fixaton/emission
mechanisms been changed by the water management of the Colorado?

This is a very interesting and useful paper that proposes a new "mixture" between
biogeochemistry and pale-environnement to determine an unexpected anthropogenic impact
after dam construction. Before publication please try to precise some vocabulary words of your
text. I don't understand what is "sequestration" ? Is it calcimass?
I don't understand also if, on the modern population, you could link calcimass and calcium
carbonate production ? I would like to be sure that you consider calcium carbonate production
(alive bivalves) as a source of CO2 (not calcium carbonate mass of dead and and alive animals).
Production of shell by M. coloradoensis population (s-?) living on the tidal flats of the CRD
should be assessed from estimates of abundance, age composition and growth rates of the
population during several years. Is it the case ? The combining of this three parameters allows
the assessment of the annual calcium carbonate production and then the measurement of the link
between calcimass and CaCO3. Please explain this constraint in your paper.
Other suggestion : dissolution (using CO2 from water) should be seriously consider/discuss.

It is clear from reading the paper how to access all supporting data.
The supplementary material is not so clear. There is an Excel file with masses of valves and shells
of bivalve mollusks, the calculated proportion of said mass that is CaCO3, and the proportion of
that which is C. There is no description of how/where/why the authors collected these valves or
what their size was in relation to previous studies (important for the results and conclusions of
the paper). These data are, as best as I can tell, the only new data produced by the author and not
mined from the literature. A proper description of the who/what/when/where/why/how the
specimens and the resulting data (or a figure or summary thereof) should appear in the
manuscript and not in the supplementary material.

The purpose of this study is to quantify an underappreciated source of carbon emission and
sequestration in estuaries and how these processes have been significantly altered through time
via water management of the Colorado River. This is an exceptionally well understood system
4
and an ideal one for making such approximations. The data are largely derived from previous
studies estimating the density of the bivalve Mulinia coloradoensis in the estuary prior to the
damming of the Colorado River and studies measuring their current post-dam densities. The
authors then calculate the amount of C emissions due to respiration and biomineralization and C
sequestration due to biomineralization before and after the dam construction. As would be
predicted from the collapse of M. coloradoensis populations over the last century, there has been
an estimated order of magnitude decrease in net C emissions in the estuary because of the
missing clams. This is a clever study and I would like to see it published pending minor
revisions.
1) My primary concern regards the mode of reporting of new data. The majority of this paper
hinges on novel analyses of previously published data estimating pre- and post-dam clam
density in the estuary. The authors calculated the mass of 100 M. coloradoensis valves, multiplied
by two to calculate the shell mass for the individual, multiplied by .95 to account for the 5% of the
shell mass that is not CaCO3, and multiplied by 0.12 to calculate the mass of C per shell. I assume
that the average mass of C per shell was used to calculate grams of C per square meter pre- and
post-dam construction based on the aforementioned clam density estimates. However, the
procedure for how and why these specimens were acquired and how the data were collected and
analyzed are poorly described to absent in the current version of the manuscript. These data and
how they were collected and analyzed are important to the conclusions and should be thoroughly
explained in the text. Moreover, the only new data produced in this study should not be buried in
Supplemental, but should be included in the text. If you need to save space, you can drop Table 3
and describe those numbers in text. Importantly, these mass estimates of the shells are not
directly comparable to the body size data briefly referred to from Kowalewksi et al.'s study
estimating pre-dam clam density. The authors state that Kowalewski et al. sieved with 12.5 mm
mesh and smaller clams were not included in their study. How do the author's new clams
compare in size to Kowalewski et al.'s old clams? Notable differences in size could be problematic
to the conclusions. Please describe their size in terms of length as well.
2) Line 119-120: Please state the value of the temperature you assumed for calculating psi. This
value can strongly influence your results and should be clearly reported. Similarly, on line 126, is
it safe to assume a pCO2 of 350 for today? How might this influence your results?
3) There are mistakes with citation format on lines 49, 175, and 176.
4) Lines 35-36: Please be more specific in this statement. Are you referring to all mollusks? All
mollusks in an estuary? Each individual mollusk?
5) Line 448: Please cite the source of this estimate.
6) Figure 1: The arrow for #1 "Burial of Organic Matter" is pointing up, but I think it should be
pointing down. Also, the cartoon seems a bit too vague. Should you include animals other than
clams?
Overall, this is a nice study and I hope it will be published following revision. It is my general
policy to not remain anonymous and to sign my reviews. The authors should feel free to contact
me should they have any questions.

Smith et al. took advantage of paleontology data and current clam biomass assessment and
concluded that dam construction in the upper reaches of Colorado River significantly reduced
carbon emission by the molluscs in the river delta. Overall it was an interesting and easy read for
me, and the authors examined estuary carbon cycle from a completely different angle than we are
used to as marine scientists.
I have no problem of seeing this manuscript being published, although as a marine scientist, I
would recommend that authors spend a bit more effort to look at relevant literature on estuarine
CO2 emission. The pioneer synthesis of Borge et al is a little dated because they only sampled
very limited number of estuaries, and the flux is grossly overestimated for global estuaries. For
example, see below references:
Chen, C.T.A. et al., 2013. Air-sea exchanges of CO2 in the world's coastal seas. Biogeosciences,
10(10): 6509-6544.
Jiang, L.-Q., Cai, W.-J. and Wang, Y., 2008. A comparative study of carbon dioxide degassing in
river- and marine-dominated estuaries. Limnology and Oceanography, 53: 2603-2615.
Laruelle, G.G., Dürr, H.H., Slomp, C.P. and Borges, A.V., 2010. Evaluation of sinks and sources of
CO2 in the global coastal ocean using a spatially-explicit typology of estuaries and continental
shelves. Geophysical Research Letters, 37(15): L15607.
In addition, I understand that the authors singled out the clams for carbon budget estimation,
although estuarine carbon cycle is way more than clam-related carbon alone. For example, river
inflow variation will lead to changes in water-air CO2 flux, primary productivity, and overall
estuarine metabolism. Thus it would be useful to introduce the readers a little bit more than what
6
is presented here, instead of just presenting the numbers that appear out of context. In light of
this discussion, I have trouble seeing the word benefits (line 199) because no one would call the
reduced biodiversity/biomass caused by river inflow decline a benefit.
At last, I understand the authors emphasized carbon emission to be align with carbon cycle
study, although somewhere early in the text please direct the readers that its actually CO2 you
are looking at (to include respiration). I see line 115 has CO2 associated with carbonate
precipitation only.
Line 36, the amount of C emission by benthic fauna, is it per shell or per kg of body weight?

Thank you for this supportive feedback.
I only suggest two changes:
1) In lines 197 and 198, when the emissions of total carbon are compared with he power
station, use also mol C to facilitate comparison with estimates for bivalve CO2 emissions.
The values are now also reported in mol C (line 199-201): emitting 1.1 x 106 t (~9.2 x
1010 mol) of carbon annually (http://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/main.do#). Similarly, Shrestha et
al. (6) estimated that 1.4 x 105 t (~1.2 x 1010 mol) of carbon are emitted
2) From line 202 the arguments seem highly speculative, although informative. At least in
lines 223-226 the authors should, in my opinion, better explain the closing new and complex
terminology such as: benefits, most option value, reversibility, social priorities.... if possible
to keep in context with the actual scientific conclusions of the manuscript, which focuses in a
section of the Colorado River lower basin. I mean... can the CO2 budgets and social
priorities etc. be assessed for that specific basin in further detail? Have there other CO2
fixation/emission mechanisms been changed by the water management of the Colorado?
We can see that the wording referred to by Reviewer 1 was confusing and overly complex
for the straightforward point we were trying to make. We have rephrased the final sentence
to more familiar terminology (lines 225-229): The unintended reduction in net carbon
emissions following the decline of mollusk populations in the Colorado River delta further
demonstrates the need to seek solutions to pressing global challenges that maximize
ecosystem services while maintaining ecosystem function as new social priorities emerge or
new scientific insight is gained (6971). We do maintain the usage of social priorities
because we believe this is general terminology.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
This is a very interesting and useful paper that proposes a new "mixture" between
biogeochemistry and paleo-environnement to determine an unexpected anthropogenic impact
after dam construction.
Thank you for this generous feedback.
Before publication please try to precise some vocabulary words of your text. I don't
understand what is "sequestration"? Is it calcimass?
We appreciate the suggestion to clarify. We prefer the more general term sequestration
(referring to matter made biologically unavailable on shorter time scales), which we believe
will be more familiar to readers than the field-specific calcimass.
I don't understand also if, on the modern population, you could link calcimass and calcium
carbonate production? I would like to be sure that you consider calcium carbonate
production (alive bivalves) as a source of CO2 (not calcium carbonate mass of dead and
alive animals). Production of shell by M. coloradoensis population (s-?) living on the tidal
flats of the CRD should be assessed from estimates of abundance, age composition and
growth rates of the population during several years. Is it the case? The combining of this
three parameters allows the assessment of the annual calcium carbonate production and then
the measurement of the link between calcimass and CaCO3. Please explain this constraint in
your paper.
As suggested by the reviewer, it looks like we didnt make it clear that this is indeed the
manner in which calcium carbonate production, and subsequent carbon emission, was
calculated. The age composition has been stated more explicitly, as well as our assumption
that growth rate was constant (lines 101-103): Annual carbon sequestration was calculated
based on standing clam density and one-third average shell dry mass (assuming constant
growth over a clams three year lifespan for ease of calculation; Table 1)
Other suggestion: dissolution (using CO2 from water) should be seriously consider/discuss.
A brief consideration of dissolution has been added as a footnote (lines 184-185):
Many processes transport (e.g., wave action, currents) and degrade (e.g.,
fragmentation, dissolution2) the remains of organisms after death (36) The
footnote reads: The process of dissolution releases carbon dioxide and contributes to
carbon cycling. Because cheniers are subaerial accumulations, however, they are not
affected by the same set of destructive processes as assemblages in other marine
environments (36). Thus, shell dissolution via seawater was likely limited. The
dissolution that did occur on the tidal flat would have effectively reduced the amount
of carbon sequestered in clam shells, resulting in greater net emissions proportionate
to total clam abundance today and in the pre-dam eras.

construction. As would be predicted from the collapse of M. coloradoensis populations over
the last century, there has been an estimated order of magnitude decrease in net C emissions
in the estuary because of the missing clams. This is a clever study and I would like to see it
published pending minor revisions.
We appreciate this lucid recapitulation and constructive review.
1) My primary concern regards the mode of reporting of new data. The majority of this paper
hinges on novel analyses of previously published data estimating pre- and post-dam clam
density in the estuary. The authors calculated the mass of 100 M. coloradoensis valves,
multiplied by two to calculate the shell mass for the individual, multiplied by .95 to account
for the 5% of the shell mass that is not CaCO3, and multiplied by 0.12 to calculate the mass
of C per shell.
I assume that the average mass of C per shell was used to calculate grams of C per square
meter pre- and post-dam construction based on the aforementioned clam density estimates.
Yes, this is a correct interpretation, as stated in the text (lines 99-104): Using these pre-dam
and present-day estimates of clam density, we then calculated annual carbon sequestration
and production from biogenic calcification and carbon emission due to respiration. Annual
carbon sequestration was calculated based on standing clam density and one-third average
shell dry mass (assuming constant growth over a clams three year lifespan for ease of
calculation; Table 1), with mass corrected to account for the approximately 5% of
compounds other than calcium carbonate in clam shells (40).
However, the procedure for how and why these specimens were acquired and how the data
were collected and analyzed are poorly described to absent in the current version of the
manuscript. These data and how they were collected and analyzed are important to the
conclusions and should be thoroughly explained in the text. Moreover, the only new data
produced in this study should not be buried in Supplemental, but should be included in the
text. If you need to save space, you can drop Table 3 and describe those numbers in text.
Importantly, these mass estimates of the shells are not directly comparable to the body size
data briefly referred to from Kowalewksi et al.'s study estimating pre-dam clam density. The
authors state that Kowalewski et al. sieved with 12.5 mm mesh and smaller clams were not
included in their study. How do the author's new clams compare in size to Kowalewski et
al.'s old clams? Notable differences in size could be problematic to the conclusions. Please
describe their size in terms of length as well.
Thank you for directing our attention to this concern. We have added text to clarify the
origin of these data (lines 108-112): We determined average shell dry mass (11.13 ± 8.3
g/ind) by taking the mass of 100 specimens of M. coloradoensis (Supplementary Table 1),
which composed as much as 95% of the molluscan community in the pre-dam era (24,36).
The M. coloradoensis specimens were randomly selected from a bulk sample (41) that was
sieved with a 12.5 mm screen to ensure comparability with the data reported by Kowalewski
et al. (23).
Although the clam masses are new data, the individual values are ancillary to the conclusions
of our study, and we therefore feel they are best presented in the supplement. We have
reported the mean and standard deviation in the text but believe a table with 100 mass values
would be burdensome to a reader.
2) Line 119-120: Please state the value of the temperature you assumed for calculating psi.
This value can strongly influence your results and should be clearly reported.
We appreciate this suggestion to clarify, and we have adjusted phrasing to explain the
omission of a temperature value (lines 126-127): Due to this limitation on temperature data,
we used the univariate <U+03C8> equation for salinity, which does not include temperature (i.e.,
assumes constant temperature): 
Similarly, on line 126, is it safe to assume a pCO2 of 350 for today? How might this
influence your results?
We feel the findings are largely insensitive to plausible changes in this value, but have added
a footnote to line 130 to explain our interpretation of the influence of pCO2:
1 350 µatm was used by Frankignoulle et al. (42) to establish the <U+03C8> equation and is
maintained here. Frankignoulle et al. (42) reported an increase in <U+03C8> as pCO2
increases, resulting in positive feedback. Consequently, <U+03C8> is higher today than it was
in the past, but 350 µatm remains an appropriate estimate for the entire post-dam
construction era (1930  present). In the pre-dam era, <U+03C8> was likely lower, however, a
decrease to 290 µatm (an estimate for the pre-industrial era; 42) results in only a
small change (0.04) in <U+03C8>. Thus, given the small difference and because the pre-dam
era also encompassed higher pCO2 during the industrial era, 350 µatm was also used
for pre-dam era calculations.
3) There are mistakes with citation format on lines 49, 175, and 176.
Thank you for catching these errors. These and all citations have been updated.
4) Lines 35-36: Please be more specific in this statement. Are you referring to all mollusks?
All mollusks in an estuary? Each individual mollusk?
We have attempted to clarify this phrasing to indicate an ecosystem-specific,
collective/group reference (lines 35-37): Mollusks are a vital element of the tidal and sub-
tidal benthic fauna of estuaries, collectively emitting 2  20 mol C yr -1 (1315) and playing
a large role in the pelagic-benthic cycling of nutrients (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus;
1619).
5) Line 448: Please cite the source of this estimate.
We have added the citation to this caption: Table 2. Estimated carbon sequestration and
emission for the pre-dam and modern eras. Pre-dam low (50 ind m -1) and high (125 ind m -1)
refer to the number of individuals per square meter inferred from chenier deposits (23).
6) Figure 1: The arrow for #1 "Burial of Organic Matter" is pointing up, but I think it should
be pointing down. Also, the cartoon seems a bit too vague. Should you include animals other
than clams?
Thank you for noting this. The arrow has been changed to point down. While it could
certainly also be valid to include other organisms, we have chosen to focus on clams for
simplicity and to emphasize the discussion of clam related carbon cycling in our manuscript.
Overall, this is a nice study and I hope it will be published following revision. It is my
general policy to not remain anonymous and to sign my reviews. The authors should feel
free to contact me should they have any questions.

Comments to the Author(s)
Smith et al. took advantage of paleontology data and current clam biomass assessment and
concluded that dam construction in the upper reaches of Colorado River significantly
reduced carbon emission by the molluscs in the river delta. Overall it was an interesting and
easy read for me, and the authors examined estuary carbon cycle from a completely different
angle than we are used to as marine scientists.
We appreciate this helpful review.
I have no problem of seeing this manuscript being published, although as a marine scientist, I
would recommend that authors spend a bit more effort to look at relevant literature on
estuarine CO2 emission. The pioneer synthesis of Borge et al is a little dated because they
only sampled very limited number of estuaries, and the flux is grossly overestimated for
global estuaries. For example, see below references:

and continental shelves. Geophysical Research Letters, 37(15): L15607.
Thank you for these valuable suggestions. We have attempted to better acknowledge where
these studies already informed the work and to address them within the space and time
allotted.
The overestimation by Borges et al. (2005) is an appropriate consideration and was
previously discussed (lines 167  170): The estimates from Borges et al. (2005) may,
however, overestimate estuarine emissions due to the abundance (69%; n=16) of high pCO2
European river systems used to make the estimates (12,53,54). In contrast, emissions from
several high latitude estuaries in the United States were reported to be considerably lower:
15  36 mol C m-2 yr -1 (12,55).
The results of Jiang et al (2008)  now reference 54  had been discussed previously but
were subsumed under reference 12 (Cai, 2011), where the same results were also discussed.
Jiang et al., (2008) are now appropriately referenced and we have included the additional
references as recommended.
In addition, I understand that the authors singled out the clams for carbon budget estimation,
although estuarine carbon cycle is way more than clam-related carbon alone. For example,
river inflow variation will lead to changes in water-air CO2 flux, primary productivity, and
overall estuarine metabolism. Thus it would be useful to introduce the readers a little bit
more than what is presented here, instead of just presenting the numbers that appear out of
context.
We agree with this larger point (indeed it factored substantially into our conversations about
manuscript strategy and structure), and our intent with Figure 1 was to illustrate this idea.
We have changed the figure caption to further emphasize this: Figure 1. A subset of the
processes involved in estuarine carbon cycling.
In addition, we believe this concern is addressed in three places:
1) The notion that clams are just one component of the system is highlighted in the
discussion (lines 219-223): Carbon emission from clams is one of many components that
contribute to a rivers total carbon footprint (Figure 1). The complexity of carbon cycling in
rivers and estuaries reflects the diverse organisms that inhabit the interwoven components of
these systems and understanding these connections will be critical to well-informed planning
and policymaking under an uncertain future.
2) We discuss the clam related carbon values in the context of cumulative estuarine carbon
emissions (lines 161-172).
3) We also discuss the clam related carbon values in the context of other carbon emissions in
the Colorado River system (lines 195-204).
In light of this discussion, I have trouble seeing the word benefits (line 199) because no
one would call the reduced biodiversity/biomass caused by river inflow decline a benefit.
The word benefit has been removed (lines 202-204): By comparison, the reduced carbon
emissions at the delta resulting from diverted flow are vastly outweighed by the carbon
emissions required to divert that flow.
At last, I understand the authors emphasized carbon emission to be align with carbon cycle
study, although somewhere early in the text please direct the readers that its actually CO2
you are looking at (to include respiration). I see line 115 has CO2 associated with carbonate
precipitation only.
We have modified the wording for clarification (lines 64-67): Accordingly, we combined
evidence of pre-dam conditions from cheniers with data from contemporary mollusk
community surveys to investigate how reduced clam density following upstream river
diversion altered carbon sequestration and emissions (in terms of CO2) in the estuary of the
CRD.
Line 36, the amount of C emission by benthic fauna, is it per shell or per kg of body weight?
Thank you for noting this. We have clarified phrasing accordingly (lines 35-37): Mollusks
are a vital element of the tidal and sub-tidal benthic fauna of estuaries, collectively emitting
2  20 mol C yr -1 (1315) and playing a large role in the pelagic-benthic cycling of nutrients
(e.g., carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus; 1619).
