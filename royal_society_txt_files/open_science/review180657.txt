Overall the paper is interesting - it reports on some unusual experimental results that are not
easily explained by any theory I am aware of. In the intro, the authors review several possibilities
and conclude none of them explain. I have a few comments in no particular order.
1) The authors claim there are no reactions because there are no bubbles. Did they try to assess
reactions in a more quantitative way, or does the small droplet size make this difficult - i.e.
measure pH?
2) I didn't really understand the brackets and the stars in all the figures? I found it distracting
from the otherwise pretty simple plots.
3) I didn't see a comment in the paper about how many repeats were done at each measurement.
Are the error bars the scatter at that condition? Is it the n=7? If so, be more explicit - i.e. say each
experiment was repeated 7 times. If it was repeated, was it with a new CNT or the same CNT but
different flow measurement? Just a sentence or two to explain how repeatable your results are.
4) The table at the end could be better formatted - or maybe all this data would be organized as
supplementary material. In any case it was hard to figure out what you were showing there.
5) I dont understand why at 40 MHZ you have 200 nL/min but can't measure lower than that. A
little more explanation would be helpful here. I don't doubt the difficulty due to the scale here.
6) Caption for figure 7 plots frequency on one axis and then reports a frequency in the caption.
That seems confusing.
7) The comment in the caption about values compared by a t-test seems unusual. I don't really
know what you mean by this comment. Are you trying to claim the data are statistically
significantly different? Why not just show the data with the error bars?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors explore the transport of aqueous electrolytes under imposed high frequency (MHz)
electric fields in a geometry that consists of a planar electrode upon which the electrolyte drop
sits and a vertically held carbon nanotube coated tungsten wire in contact with the drop. Under
certain conditions, they observe that the electrolyte migrate up the tungsten wire.
They make the assertion that the this is a previously unreported behavior and that it cannot be
explained by existing theories, namely, dielectrophoresis, induced charge electroosmosis,
travelling wave, AC, and rectified AC electroosmosis. While this may indeed be a novel
phenomenon, it is my opinion that they have not done an adequate job of exploring the details of
the other theories that they present, nor have they included all electrokinetic phenomena.
Furthermore, they present their experimental observations, but provide no theoretical
explanation for the observed behavior. I would recommend publication only after major revisions
to the manuscript. My specific comments are below:
1. In the introduction, dielectrophoresis, induced charge electroosmosis, travelling wave, AC, and
rectified AC electroosmosis are all listed as possibly related and the authors attempt to explain
why each theory is inadequate. The treatment is qualitative and sparse. I suggest the authors
include a more detailed treatment of each of these theories, presenting the relevant equations that
explain fluid flow under each theory and then explain why the presented experiment does not fit
with theory.
2. On line 26, the statement "the mechanism of ‘ICEO’ is based on the movement of small
particles, however, the discovered phenomenon happens without any particles" is false. ICEO can
occur around any polarizable surface. The authors cite: Squires, T. M.; Bazant, M. Z. Induced-
Charge Electro-Osmosis. Journal of Fluid
Mechanics 2004, 509, 217–252. I encourage the authors to re-read section 5 that describe ICEO
flow around electrically floating electrodes in microfluidic devices.
3. There are several other electrokinetic phenomena that the authors neglect to consider as
possible explanations of the observed effect:
Electrowetting: The presented setup is similar to those found in the electrowetting literature.
The following review may be helpful in assessing: Mugele, Frieder, and Jean-Christophe Baret.
“Electrowetting: From Basics to Applications.” Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter 17, no. 28
(2005): R705. https://doi.org/10.1088/0953-8984/17/28/R01.
Electrothermal flows: For example, theories presented in: García-Sánchez, Pablo, Antonio
Ramos, and Frieder Mugele. “Electrothermally Driven Flows in Ac Electrowetting.” Physical
Review E 81, no. 1 (January 2010). https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.81.015303. González, A.,
A. Ramos, H. Morgan, N. G. Green, and A. Castellanos. “Electrothermal Flows Generated by
4
Alternating and Rotating Electric Fields in Microsystems.” Journal of Fluid Mechanics 564
(October 2006): 415. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112006001595.
Electrohydrodynamic flows: For example, theories presented in: Esmaeeli, Asghar, and Payam
Sharifi. “Transient Electrohydrodynamics of a Liquid Drop.” Physical Review E 84, no. 3 (2011):
036308. https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.84.036308. Ristenpart, W. D, I. A Aksay, and D. A
Saville. “Electrohydrodynamic Flow around a Colloidal Particle near an Electrode with an
Oscillating Potential.” Journal of Fluid Mechanics 575 (2007): 83–109.
4. The authors should perform a flow visualization experiment, such as micro-PIV, to look at flow
patterns in the system during the experiment. This will help to determine a possible mechanism.
5. The authors provide no competing theory to explain their observations. If it isn't a well
established theory, then what is the physical mechanism that is driving the flow?
6. The authors should provide more detail on the experimental setup. Specifically, details on the
electronics utilized for the experiment. For instance, what is the model number of the power
supply used? How much current was flowing during the experiment? What is the conductivity of
the electrolytes?
With these significant revisions, I feel that the manuscript would be more impactful to the
community.

The authors have included additional details of electrokinetic theories in the text as I
recommended in the initial review; however, some of the analysis given, in particular, on
electrowetting is difficult to follow. I believe more analysis needs to be performed beyond the
qualitative explanation given by the authors. In specific:
Will the authors please provide more explanation for this statement: "However, electrowetting
differs from the phenomenon we describe in that an insulating layer is placed between the
mother droplet and the plane electrode; this renders monodirectional flow impossible"
To my knowledge, electrowetting usually performed on a dielectric layer to limit Faradaic
reactions. Electrowetting can and does occur on bare metal electrodes a well. Regardless, I do not
see how the presences of an insulator mean that monodirectional flow is impossible. Please
explain.
Also, the field is very high near the tip of the nanotube. The authors state that the CNT has a
diameter of ~1 nm, and the effect appears at >5Vpp. This means that peak electric fields near the
CNT tip are on the order of 10^9 V/m. This is much higher than the dielectric breakdown
strength of water which is ~70*10^6 V/m. Is it possible that this effect isdue to electrical
breakdown?

Appendix A
Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Oliver Jensen):
Associate Editor: 1
Comments to the Author:
Please make a further revision of your paper to address the specific points
raised by the reviewer. In particular, please remove the assertion (sentence 2
of the Conclusions) that "The discovered phenomenon ... cannot be explained
using previous theories." This comment is not fully supported by your
analysis.
In addition to dielectric breakdown as a candidate mechanism of the effect,
please also comment on the possibility of acoustic (steady) streaming as a
possible mechanism.
: We changed the manuscript considering your comments.
Acoustic streaming is a steady flow caused by the absorption of high
amplitude of acoustic vibration. According to Ko et al., the amplitude of the
liquid air interface decreases as the frequency at which the AC electric field
applied, and vibration is hardly observed at frequencies higher than 8 kHz [1].
Since AC electric field with frequencies of several tens of MHz is applied in
this experiment, it is difficult to deduce it as flow by acoustic streaming.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have included additional details of electrokinetic theories in the
text as I recommended in the initial review; however, some of the analysis
given, in particular, on electrowetting is difficult to follow. I believe more
analysis needs to be performed beyond the qualitative explanation given by
the authors. In specific:
Will the authors please provide more explanation for this statement:
"However, electrowetting differs from the phenomenon we describe in that an
insulating layer is placed between the mother droplet and the plane electrode;
this renders monodirectional flow impossible"
To my knowledge, electrowetting usually performed on a dielectric layer to
limit Faradaic reactions. Electrowetting can and does occur on bare metal
electrodes a well. Regardless, I do not see how the presences of an insulator
mean that monodirectional flow is impossible. Please explain.
: We looked up the relevant data after the reviewer’s opinion that electrowetting
can and does occur on bare metal electrodes a well. In our investigation,
electrowetting is generally difficult to occur on the surface of solid conductor
(1) and in the case of liquid metals such as Ga, electrowetting can occur on
metal surfaces because a thin oxide layer is formed on the metal surface (2). We
have found a paper on electrowetting on bare electrodes using stainless steel as
an electrode (3). In this case, the response was much slower than EWOD. One
directional liquid pumping occurs at frequencies of tens of MHz and it is higher
than ordinary AC EWOD frequencies. Since the response time of
electrowetting on bare metal electrode is much slower than that of EWOD,
which will lead to a larger difference in the frequency range. In addition, liquid
pumping does not be observed when as insulating layer laid on the gold
electrode surface such as EWOD structures.

Also, the field is very high near the tip of the nanotube. The authors state that
the CNT has a diameter of ~1 nm, and the effect appears at >5Vpp. This
means that peak electric fields near the CNT tip are on the order of 10^9 V/m.
This is much higher than the dielectric breakdown strength of water which is
~70*10^6 V/m. Is it possible that this effect is due to electrical breakdown?
: The diameter of CNT nanowires coated by gold nanoparticles were about 800
nm. Thus, the peak electric fields near CNT nanowires are on the order of ~6.25
M V/m. This value is smaller than the dielectric breakdown strength of water.
