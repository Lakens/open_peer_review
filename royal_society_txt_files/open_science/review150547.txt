This article addresses an issue of paramount importance in current science, namely motivating
researchers, journal editors and others towards open science. The Initiative is thoughtful and
highly innovative, involving referees voluntarily declining to offer full peer review on submitted
manuscripts unless and until a minimum set of openness criteria have been reached.
I will keep my comments extremely brief as I believe this is an exemplary article that will provoke
much discussion and, in all likelihood, make a sizable impact on practise.
It is not completely clear whether the article meets the journal’s aims and scope as it is an
opinion/agenda article rather than one reporting novel science. This issue however is an editorial
matter.
Other than this point, I recommend acceptance.

The pdf I downloaded for review had twice the article in it – I assumed this was the exact two
same versions (I did not check line by line – and started reading p12). Overall the paper is good
(in particular the discussion) and I have no concern. The initiative proposed is worthwhile too – I
signed in.

Introduction
P12, Line 10: I’m sure to follow the 2nd source of responsibility: (1) is that we do science and this
is how it works, (3) is that we do science with public money but what is (2) ‘responsibility to the
community of scientists …’ – maybe you could add 1 sentence for each ‘source’ making sure
every reader understand what you mean.
P12, Line 36-37: talking data journal and repositories, maybe in annex you could provide an up-
to-date list of journals and repositories with links? I like as a reader to have links to the concepts
or ideas presented, I think it makes things immediately more real and engage more the reader.
P12, Line 45 – how does sharing make science more efficient? I’m just playing the devil advocate
here, I think it is best to explain this to the reader.
P12, Line 53 – ‘open research is rare’ do you know of any sociological work on that? Like some
survey per scientific field – that would make that claim more tangible. For instance we always
hear that people in physics share more, that certainly the case for cosmology and particle physics
but I’m not sure it’s true for other areas.
P13, Line 16 – ‘implementing open practices is not difficult’. I’m going to take my personal
experience on this, with 2 papers I published this year (2015). Yes, it was easy for me to share and
relatively easy to make a code that read the data and spit out the results in my Cortex paper,
where I collected behavioural data in patients. No, it wasn’t easy to share (the preparation and
metadata) and make automated scripts for my neuroimage paper analysing >200 fMRI subjects.
My point is that implementing open practices can be difficult (and I’m even not detailing the
work we are putting in to e bale share patient sensitive information via dedicate repositories) and
takes time. Once we are used to it, it becomes easier and faster. It needs maybe a bit of
moderation here, as clearly in depends on the field and data type.
The Peer Reviewers’ Openness Initiative – the initiative
- Data should be made publicly available. One aspect to specify (maybe earlier in the
manuscript) is what you mean by data – I just reviewed a paper on a method/toolbox but you
cannot yet download it! obviously I complained … so data can be a software
- Documents containing details for interpreting any files … Again, that really depends on
the fields, it can be relatively easy to extremely complicated and we have to use standards. I agree
that we should not wait for standards as they will come by the need created – maybe again in
annex you can list existing ontologies and standards for humanities (cognitive atlas, NIDM,
others) – this help readers to get started.

23rd November 2015
Dear Dr Morey
On behalf of the Editors, I am pleased to inform you that your Manuscript RSOS-150547 entitled
"The Peer Reviewers' Openness Initiative: Incentivising Open Research Practices through Peer
Review" has been accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science subject to minor
4
revision in accordance with the referee suggestions. Please find the referees' comments at the end
of this email.
The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript.
• Authors’ contributions
All submissions, other than those with a single author, must include an Authors’ Contributions
section which individually lists the specific contribution of each author. The list of Authors
should meet all of the following criteria; 1) substantial contributions to conception and design, or
acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it
critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be published.
All contributors who do not meet all of these criteria should be included in the
acknowledgements.
We suggest the following format:
AB carried out the molecular lab work, participated in data analysis, carried out sequence
alignments, participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript; CD carried out
the statistical analyses; EF collected field data; GH conceived of the study, designed the study,
coordinated the study and helped draft the manuscript. All authors gave final approval for
publication.

Comments to the Author:
Editor's note: The reviewers were generally positive about the manuscript and we are prepared to
publish it as an opinion piece, subject to some minor revisions as detailed below. In your revision
please include a point-by-point response to the reviewers.
In addition to the comments by the Associate Editor/Reviewers, the Subject Editor (Prof Essi
Viding) has requested that you add some consideration of the following issues to the manuscript:
1) Should there be any system for 'vetting' individuals who can access data that is made
available? I.e. should such data be analysed only by people who have some minimum level of
research training (or under supervision of someone with a minimum level of research training)
and/or are affiliated with a research organisation? There are a number of psychometric
instruments that cannot be administered without a minimum level (usually graduate degree)
training - in order to ensure that the instruments are administered in a valid way, as much as is
practicably possible to ensure. Given that people can be active in the blog sphere (i.e. they may
reanalyse data and not necessarily submit that analysis to peer or ethical review), it would seem
important to discuss in the manuscript whether this is an important ethical consideration and
what the authors propose here (apologies if I have missed this in the article). E.g. what are the
ethical implications of someone potentially misusing data to advance an ideological argument,
when such research would have been unlikely to pass IRB/Ethics approval?
2) A related issue, which I think deserves a specific consideration in the manuscript, is consent.
Participants (in particular when in clinical groups or when the information collected is highly
sensitive) have traditionally consented to their data being analysed by a specific investigator with
some institutional/academic credentials (or in the case of big cohort studies, by a set of
investigators who have typically been vetted in some way), with regard to a defined set of
research aims. No doubt, many participants would be happy for their anonymous data to be
shared openly, but others may not be and should clearly be given the option not to do so - unless
we are to put off potential participants and thus restrict the representativeness of our samples. At
what point would it become unadvisable not to reanalyse those data that are made openly
available, if a good proportion of the original sample has declined data sharing, thus severely
reducing the original sample size?

Keywords: open science, scientific practice, peer review
Abstract: Openness is one of the central values of science. Open scientific practices such as
sharing data, materials, and analysis scripts alongside published articles have many benefits,
including easier replication and extension studies, increased availability of data for theory-
building and meta-analysis, and increased possibility of review and collaboration even after a
paper has been published. Although modern information technology makes sharing easier than
ever before, uptake of open practices had been slow. We suggest this might be in part due to a
social dilemma arising from misaligned incentives, and propose a specific, concrete mechanism --
reviewers withholding comprehensive review -- to achieve the goal of creating the expectation of
open practices as a matter of scientific principle.

Response to reviews
Richard D. Morey
25 November 2015
r Professor Viding,
coauthors and I are pleased to submit a revision of our manuscript, “The Peer Reviewers’ Openness
iative: Incentivising Open Research Practices through Peer Review” to Royal Society Open Science. We
e made small tweaks to the writing, as well as changes in response to the reviews which I outline below.
change not in response to reviewers that deserves note is that we have changed the date that the Initiative
t to start to 1 January 2017 from 1 June 2016. We had always planned to have about a year to enable
ing up of conference symposia and other publicity so that reviewers have some time to learn about the
iative and so that authors aren’t blind-sided. With the Journal’s “accept” decision, we have finally set
date, and have also reset the signatures on the website to ensure no one is upset by the change in the
s. Previous signatories will be invited to re-sign the Initiative.
ow, I outline the comments of the reviewers and the corresponding changes (or reasons for no change).
my own behalf and that of my coauthors, thank you for your support and comments on this manuscript.

“Should there be any system for ‘vetting’ individuals who can access data that is made available?”
“A related issue, which I think deserves a specific consideration in the manuscript, is consent.”
believe this is largely a matter for individual fields, but we have touched on these issues in the revision.
er “Authors may be unable to share (some of their) data or materials”, the third and fourth paragraph
read:
e Royal Society Science Policy Centre [24] notes that in some cases, publicly releasing data can be ethically
blematic. For instance, the rarity of some genetic disorders, such as Huntington’s disease, makes the cases
ibly identifiable. Research participants who consented to data release among qualified researchers may not
ent to public data release. For some specialized research, secure data repositories accessible only by vetted
archers may be a better option than fully open data. Authors and reviewers should weigh the legal and
cal consequences of releasing data in the context of their research.”
her problematic cases include issues of copyright: if scientists are using materials that are copyrighted
another organization, they may not have permission to release them publicly. The common thread in
xamples of limited openness is that they should be thoughtful, justifiable in principle, and justified to
ers and reviewers. For further discussion of the limits of openness, see [24], Chapter 3.”
ddition, we have drafted a form letter that can be sent by a researcher to their IRB to get guidance on the
cs of sharing data openly. This letter is linked to on the companion website, and can be found in a footnote
paragraphs above, and here: https://opennessinitiative.org/enlisting-help-from-your-institution/.

maybe you could add 1 sentence for each ‘source’ making sure every reader understand what you

second source – the community of science – is an oblique reference to “standing on the shoulders of
ts”. To make this clearer, we have reworded the sentence: “This responsibility flows from several sources:
epistemic responsibility to substantiate our claims with evidence, our responsibility to the community
cientists from whom we obtained most of our knowledge, and our responsibility to society at large that
ports our research.”
maybe in annex you could provide an up-to-date list of journals and repositories with links?
do have a list of repositories on the website. Currently, no journal (that we know) requires both data and
erials, or explanation, as the Initiative does, but we know of at least one journal that will do so in the
r future. As this list grows, we will add a list to the Initiative website.
how does sharing make science more efficient?
have reworded this sentence to “. . . will make scientific research more efficient, as research can be more
ly understood and replicated, mistakes can be found more easily, and needless duplication of effort across
can be reduced.”
‘open research is rare’ do you know of any sociological work on that?

did not mean that sharing does not take time and effort, of course; often the work is dull but not “difficult”,
se. We have reworded the sentence: “Learning open practices is not difficult, but implementing them
s take time and may delay the publication process, even if only for a few days.”
so data can be a software
s was a topic of discussion earlier in the project. We would love to include software in the Initiative, but
deliberately omitted code from this (second) version of the document. The reason is that code often
complicated copyright restrictions. Universities often revert copyright for text and materials back to
authors, but because some software is monetizable, the copyright for code remains with the University.
did not want to encourage people to do things which might potentially have legal complications, so we
oved software from the Initiative. We hope that over the next few years, Universities clarify their policies
hat code is not problematic, but until then, it is probably best to leave this up to individual authors to
de.

Documents containing details for interpreting any files . . . Again, that really depends on the fields,
it can be relatively easy to extremely complicated and we have to use standards.
s is true. It would be too much to account for the practices of every field in a single position document
this one; what we have done is to provide a few diverse examples on the website, which we will curate.
good examples are published, we will link to these, and hopefully the standards will arise naturally as
archers borrow ideas from one another.
