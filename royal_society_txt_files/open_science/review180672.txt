Han et al reported their results on the synthesis of methyl laurate from lauric acid (LA) and
methanol using ionic liquids as catalysts. The efficiencies of three different catalysts,
[Hmim]HSO4, [Hnmp]HSO4, and H2SO4 were compared. The effect of the methanol/lauric acid
mole ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time, and catalyst dosage on the esterification rate of
LA was investigated by single factor experiments. The optimal conditions for the reaction were
obtained and the esterification rate of LA conversion reached 98.58%. It could be accepted for
publication, however, I suggested they consider the following two comments.
1 Ionic liquids were used at 70 degree (even 115 degree) and recycled at 80 degree for a long time,
therefore the long term stability of the ionic liquids are very important. Are these ionic liquids
stable at that temperature? Ref Chem Rev, 2017, 117(10), 7113–7131. and Ind Eng Chem Res, 2014,

2 The authors took the control experiments for different ionic liquids as catalysts, however, I
think it is also important to compare with other types of catalysts in refs.

RSOS-180672)
Dear Dr. Laura Smith:
Thank you very much for you and reviewer’s comments for
helping us to improve our manuscript. Those comments are all
valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our paper, as
well as the important guiding significance to our researches. We have
studied comments carefully and have made correction which we hope
meet with approval. In addition, the paper was edited by Language
Editing Services at American Journal Experts (www.aje.com).
I would be greatly appreciated if you could spend some of your
time on our resubmission. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Changes in the text are highlighted in red to follow them easily.
Please, see bellow the list of answers to reviewers’ comments:
Regarding Reviewer 1:
Han et al reported their results on the synthesis of methyl laurate
from lauric acid (LA) and methanol using ionic liquids as catalysts.
The efficiencies of three different catalysts, [Hmim]HSO4,
[Hnmp]HSO4, and H2SO4 were compared. The effect of the
methanol/lauric acid mole ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time,
and catalyst dosage on the esterification rate of LA was investigated
by single factor experiments. The optimal conditions for the reaction
were obtained and the esterification rate of LA conversion reached
98.58%. It could be accepted for publication, however, I suggested
they consider the following two comments.
Response:
Thanks for your positive comments.
1. Ionic liquids were used at 70 degree (even 115 degree) and recycled
at 80 degree for a long time, therefore the long term stability of the
ionic liquids are very important. Are these ionic liquids stable at that
temperature? Ref Chem Rev, 2017, 117(10), 7113–7131. and Ind Eng
Chem Res, 2014, 53, 8651–8664.
Response:
Thank you for your comments. The decomposition temperature of
the ionic liquid [Hnmp]HSO4 was determined by TG-DSC. According
to TG-DSC curve of the ionic liquid [Hnmp]HSO4 in Fig. 1, it can be
seen that the thermal decomposition temperatures of the catalyst was
much higher than temperatures in this experiment. The onset
temperatures for IL [Hnmp]HSO4 was 227 °C, this result was
consistent with reported previously [25], in which Ref Chem Rev,
2017, 117(10), 7113–7131. and Ind Eng Chem Res, 2014, 53, 8651–
8664, [HSO4]-based ILs (with [BMIM] or [BPy] cation) are the
moderately stable (300 °C = Tonset < 350 °C). According to Ref Ind
Eng Chem Res, 2014, 53, 8651–8664., T0.01/10h for IL could be
estimated approximately by Tonset, so T0.01/10h for IL [Hnmp]HSO4 was
about 122 °C. We have added the result description in our revised
version and the references mentioned above have been cited (Page 5,
lines 24 to 31).

2. The authors took the control experiments for different ionic liquids
as catalysts, however, I think it is also important to compare with other
types of catalysts in refs.
Response:
Thank you for your comments. We have compared the catalysts
used with other types of catalysts in refs. The performance of various
catalysts in the esterification of LA is summarized in Table 2, where
the response is reported as the LA conversion. Clearly, the IL used in
this study exhibited lower catalytic activity in the esterification of LA
than some solid catalysts, i.e., ferric alginate [31] and CePW12O40 [32].
But, the conversion was better than the conversion achieved using
montmorillonite K10 [33], and MMT-NO3 [34], SO42-/SnO2-SiO2 [35].
In this study, the IL [Hnmp]HSO4 showed some advantages in our case.
First, it showed higher conversion rates than the IL [Hmim]HSO4.
Second, the use of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as a source of cations is
more economical than the use of 1-methylimidazole and
1-methylpyrrolidine [30]. In addition, the recycling of [Hnmp]HSO4
was very easy. Taking all factors into consideration, [Hnmp]HSO4 was
selected for further research.

Regarding Reviewer 2:
The authors reported a systematic study on the optimization of methyl
laurate synthesis catalyzed by an ionic liquid [Hnmp]HSO4 using the
response surface methodology. The results are interesting, while major
revision is suggested before it can be considered further for
publication.
Response:
Thanks for your positive comments.
1. Please clearly clarify the novelty of this work in a more right way in
the introduction section.
Response:
Thank you for your comments. To highlight the novelty of the
paper, we have carefully revised the introduction section of the
manuscript. Introduction section (Page 2, lines 8 to 18) has been
revised as following:
…Biodiesel synthesis via esterification reactions has been
conducted using ILs as catalysts; however, the kinetics of the
esterification of LA are very limited in the literature. Kinetic studies
are focused on the influences of temperature on reaction rates, which
also critically depend on the type of fatty acid used, the nature and
amount of the catalyst used and the temperature.
The kinetics of LA esterification catalysed by IL [Hnmp]HSO4
have not been reported previously in the literature. This study is
essential for conducting the parametric optimization of the
esterification process of LA using response surface methodology RSM
[24]. In addition, the present work also calculated the kinetics of the
esterification process. Specifically, under the condition of removing
water with 3A molecular sieves, the esteri<U+FB01>cation of LA with methanol
catalysed by [Hnmp]HSO4 was investigated. RSM was employed to
optimize the catalyst levels, methanol/LA molar ratio and reaction time.
Moreover, a kinetic model was proposed, and the kinetic parameters
were determined by fitting the model with the experimental results.
2. Page 4 Effect of four different catalysts on the lauric acid
Conversion. The referee can not understand why only these four
catalysts are selected for comparison. How about the catalytic
performance of others, especially that of commercially available solid
catalysts?
Response:
Thank you for your comments. According to literatures report
[9,25,29,30], imidazolium salts are the most widely investigated ILs
and have been applied in many fields [9]. [Hmim]HSO4 is a Brønsted
acid IL composed of 1-methyl imidazole and concentrated sulfuric
acid, and H2SO4 is the most commonly used acid catalyst [29]. IL
[Hnmp]HSO4 has several advantages: (1) the preparation of
[Hnmp]HSO4 is very easy, and the cost is low [25,30]. (2) The IL
[Hnmp]HSO4 showed good catalytic performance for the esterification
of acetic acid with n-butanol. The esterification procedure could be
carried out at mild temperatures, and the esters produced could be
isolated conveniently in high yields and purity [25]. Therefore, the use
of [Hnmp]HSO4 will reduce production costs. The reaction without
catalyst was also carried out to evaluate the conversion gain provided
by the catalyst over the non-catalytic reaction performance.
About the catalytic performance of others, we have compared the
catalysts used with other types of catalysts in refs. The performance of
various catalysts in the esterification of LA is summarized in Table 2,
where the response is reported as the LA conversion. Clearly, the IL
used in this study exhibited lower catalytic activity in the esterification
of LA than some solid catalysts, i.e., ferric alginate [31] and
CePW12O40 [32]. But, the conversion was better than the conversion
achieved using montmorillonite K10 [33], and MMT-NO3 [34],
SO42-/SnO2-SiO2 [35]. In this study, the IL [Hnmp]HSO4 showed some
advantages in our case. First, it showed higher conversion rates than
the IL [Hmim]HSO4. Second, the use of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as a
source of cations is more economical than the use of
1-methylimidazole and 1-methylpyrrolidine [30]. In addition, the
recycling of [Hnmp]HSO4 was very easy. Taking all factors into
consideration, [Hnmp]HSO4 was selected for further research.

3. Page 5 Single factor experiments. The other mole ratios should be
discussed as well. The reasons for the effect of different mole ratio on
the conversion of lauric acid are suggested to illustrate.
Response:
Thank you for your suggestion. We have illustrated the effect of
the other molar ratios on the conversion of lauric acid. We have added
the result description in our revised version (Page 5, lines 13 to 17) as
following:
…The molar ratio of methanol to LA varied from 1:1 to 9:1, and
the conversions obtained are shown in Figure 2. The greater the
amount of methanol added was, the higher the conversion of LA to
methyl laurate obtained in the same reaction time. The LA conversion
rapidly increased as the molar ratio up to 6:1 and decreased thereafter.
The highest conversion of lauric acid achieved was 96.87% with a
methanol to LA molar rate of 6:1 in 4 h. Further increases in this molar
ratio did not result in an increase in the conversion, which could be
because of the excess methanol, which diluted the concentration of
hydrogen ions in the reaction mixture.…
4. The detailed data of the catalyst recyclability should be shown and
discussed explicitly.
Response:
Thank you for your comments. The detailed data of the catalyst
recyclability have been shown and discussed explicitly in our revised
version. Section 3.5 (Page 7, lines 44 to 49) has been revised as
following:
To reduce the cost of the experiment, the possibility of recycling
[Hnmp]HSO4 was investigated. The recycled IL was used in each
cycle after the removal of water and unreacted methanol. After five
recycles, the data shown in Figure 8 indicate that there is little
decrease in catalytic activity. The esterification rate of LA was still
above 95%, which was in accordance with the literature [23]. Its
performance in the esterification demonstrates the outstanding activity
and excellent operational stability of the [Hnmp]HSO4 catalyst.
However, as catalysts for the esterification of FFAs, other ILs, such as
[NMP][CH3SO3] and [BMIM][HSO4], could be recycled eight times
and five times, respectively [20,47].
Fig. 8. Effect of the number of cycles of the catalyst on the LA
conversion.
5.In conclusion section, the relevant insights are suggested to present,
so as to highlight the significance of this work.
Response:
Thank you for your comments. To highlight the significance of
this work, the conclusion section (P7, lines 54 to 59 and P8, lines 1 to
3) has been revised as following:
This study indicated that IL [Hnmp]HSO4 is an effective catalyst
for methyl laurate synthesis. The esterification procedure could be
carried out at mild temperature, and the esters produced could be
isolated conveniently. Response surface tests indicated that the optimal
conditions were as follows: [Hnmp]HSO4 dosage of 5.23%,
methanol/LA molar ratio of 7.68:1, reaction time of 2.27 h at 70 °C;
under these conditions, the LA conversion reached 98.35%. Moreover,
a simple kinetic model was proposed, and the kinetic parameters were
estimated by regression analysis. The activation energy and the
frequency factor were determined to be 68.45 kJ/mol and 1.9198×109
min-1, respectively. Notably, the catalytic activity of [Hnmp]HSO4 was
still high after 5 cycles. Therefore, the process could become a viable
alternative to the conventional process due to the uniqueness of the IL
[Hnmp]HSO4 as a green catalyst, and could provide reference for the
scale-up esterification of LA.
6. Kinetic study on the reaction system is suggested to further improve
its quality.
Response:
Thank you for your suggestion. We have carried out the kinetic
study on the reaction system and added this part of the content in our
revised version. These details have been added in the Section 2.7 and
3.4. Thus, we have modified the title of this paper as follows:
“Optimization and kinetic study of methyl laurate synthesis using ionic
liquid [Hnmp]HSO4 as a catalyst”.
7. How about the activity of the catalyst used for other substrates?
Response:
Thank you for your comments. We have also studied the activity
of the catalyst used for oleic acid. Under the conditions of catalyst
[Hnmp]HSO4 dosage 5%, methanol/oleic acid mole ratio 9:1, reaction
time 3 h at 70 °C, the oleic acid conversion reached 83.56%.
8. Please carefully check some writing errors or typos.
Response:
Thank you for your comments. The English has been improved in
our revised version, and the paper was also edited by Language
Editing Services at American Journal Experts (www.aje.com).
