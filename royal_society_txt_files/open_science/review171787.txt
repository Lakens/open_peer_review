The manuscript may be publishable once the authors improve the sensitivity of detection and
address the following concern:
1. PL emission spectra of cyclodextrin derivative (2) in presence and absence of DADP show a
very little change. This is due to the formation of poor inclusion complex between cyclodextrin
derivative and DADP. A similar argument is valid for TATP. Therefore, beta-cyclodextrin
derivates could not be suitable sensor for detecting DADP and TATP.
2. A controlled study should be shown using adamantane or other hydrophobic molecule which
form effective inclusion complex with cyclodextrin.
3. If it is a solubility issue, the author should perform experiments in other solvents to improve
the sensitivity.
4. All the PL spectra with increasing concentration of DADP and TATP should be shown.

The authors developed two fluorescent chemosensors for the detection of acetone peroxide
explosives - this is an important result. The manuscript is concise and clearly written. I
recommend it for publication, following some minor complements and corrections.
In Summary, I suggest (i) to mention the click reaction as the key step of the synthesis; (ii) to give
3
a hint on the difference between 1 and 2; (iii) to declare that the sensitivity of the adduct with the
longer linker was higher.
…’as expected for dansyl fluorophore’… some reference would be helpful here
(Caption for fig. 3, left) the concentration of added DAPD is missing
The concentrations of the DADP/TATP stock solutions is not presented
The addition of TATP/DADP analyte in methanol to the solution of the sensor in H2O-methanol
mixture changes the composition of the solvent mixture. How much the solvent composition
changed through the titrations?

Appendix A
Dear James Moore,
Thank you very much for your e-mail related with the manuscript RSOS-171787
entitled “Towards the fluorogenic detection of peroxide explosives through host-guest
chemistry”.
We have addressed the comments raised by the reviewers, which have helped to obtain
an improved version of the manuscript.
Please find below a point-by-point response to the referees’ comments including a
description of the new experiments carried out and a list of the changes we have
included in this new version of our manuscript. We have highlighted these changes in
the revised manuscript.
Reviewer 1
We would like to thank the reviewer for his/her comments and suggestions about the
research included in the manuscript. In response to the reviewer points:
1. PL emission spectra of cyclodextrin derivative (2) in presence and absence of DADP
show a very little change. This is due to the formation of poor inclusion complex
between cyclodextrin derivative and DADP. A similar argument is valid for TATP.
Therefore, beta-cyclodextrin derivates could not be suitable sensor for detecting DADP
and TATP.
We agree with the reviewer comment. In order to improve the sensitivity of the systems
towards TATP and DADP, in the titration experiments, the mixtures of sensor 1 and
peroxide explosives have been incubated at 40 ºC for 10 min before measuring their
fluorescence emission. With this new protocol, we could improve the fluorescence
response towards TATP from 2–3 % to almost 11 %. We have included this new
protocol and the new results in the revised manuscript. Accordingly, we have included
the new fluorescence spectra in the manuscript and we have moved the previous results
at room temperature to the Supporting Materials (Fig S1–S4)
2. A controlled study should be shown using adamantane or other hydrophobic
molecule which form effective inclusion complex with cyclodextrin.
As wisely suggested by the reviewer, titration experiments were undertaken with sensor
1 in the presence of increasing amounts of adamantane in MeOH, following the same
protocol used for TATP and DADP. Surprisingly, we obtained almost the same result as
for TATP when using the same equivalent amounts of analyte. These titration
experiments are mentioned in the revised manuscript and the corresponding
fluorescence spectra have been included in Supporting Materials (Fig S7)
3. If it is a solubility issue, the author should perform experiments in other solvents to
improve the sensitivity.
We have performed experiments with MeOH/H2O (90:10), MeCN/H2O (90:10) and
pure MeOH, but in all cases, the decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the sensor was
much smaller.
4. All the PL spectra with increasing concentration of DADP and TATP should be
shown.
As suggested by the reviewer, all the PL spectra with increasing concentrations of
DADP and TATP are shown in the manuscript (for 1 and TATP) or in the Supporting
Materials
5. a) There are grammatical, reference formatting errors, and other typos in the
manuscript and supporting information (SI).
We have tried to correct all the grammatical errors or typos thay we have found in the
text
b) 2nd sentence of Spectroscopic studies (on Page-4 of SI) is currently written as
“emission wavelength was 340 nm”. Please change ‘emission’ to ‘excitation’.
This change has been made
Reviewer 2
We would like to thank the reviewer for his positive comments about the research
included in the manuscript and his valuable suggestions. In response to the reviewer
points:
1) I suggest (i) to mention the click reaction as the key step of the synthesis
We have mentioned in the text that the click reaction is the key step of the synthesis
2) (ii) to give a hint on the difference between 1 and 2; (iii) to declare that the
sensitivity of the adduct with the longer linker was higher.
We had not enough compound 2 to repeat all the titration experiments using the new
protocol of incubation at 40 ºC. All the new experiments were performed only with
compound 1, except the detection of TATP which was been conducted with sensor 2
(results not shown in the manuscript). In this case, compound 1 showed higher
sensitivity towards TATP than compound 2, with a decrease in the fluorescence
intensity of 11 % (for compound 1) versus ca. 8 % (for compound 2). As we have no
more data to compare both sensing performances, we prefer not to comment on the
slight differences between them, which now seem to favor compound 1.
3)…’as expected for dansyl fluorophore’… some reference would be helpful here
We have included reference [10]
4) (Caption for fig. 3, left) the concentration of added DAPD is missing
We have change Fig 3 (left and right) and have included in the caption the
corresponding concentrations of TATP
5) The concentrations of the DADP/TATP stock solutions is not presented
The concentration of the DADP/TATP stock solutions is 5 x 10-4 M. This
concentrations have been included in Spectroscopic studies section in the Supplem.
Material
6) The addition of TATP/DADP analyte in methanol to the solution of the sensor in
H2O-methanol mixture changes the composition of the solvent mixture. How much the
solvent composition changed through the titrations?
The maximum change in volume through the titrations is less than 3 % (after the
addition of 15 equivalents of analyte in MeOH). This has been indicated in the
Supplementary Material, in the section of Spectroscopic studies.
We hope the experiments carried out and the changes included in the revised manuscript
will have adequately answered the points raised by referees, and that this new version
should be suitable for publication.

Dr. Pablo Gaviña
