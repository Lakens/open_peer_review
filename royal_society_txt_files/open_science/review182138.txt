This research by Xu Yu et al. provides an approach in the effect of chemical additives on EKR of
Cr-contaminated soil coupled with a PRB. Remediation technologies of contaminated soil are an
important topic and a cutting-edge research direction, especially EKR technology. Although there
are several studies in literature that have reported EKR of heavy metal in soil, there is still work
to be done regarding the choice of electrolyte solutions, the application of permeable reactive
barrier/PRB, the energy-saving of EKR and the mechanism of action of agent, etc. In this study,
CTMAB-Z and mixture of CTMAB-Z and Fe (0) were used as PRB reactive media, the effect of
chemical additives, such as di-tartaric and tween 80, on EKR of Cr-contaminated soil coupled
with PRB, and relatedly reactive mechanisms were discussed. In addition, the three factors
including repair time, voltage gradient and dl-tartaric acid concentration were investigated by
utilizing multifactor orthogonal experiment, and an optimal reactive condition was disclosed.
The manuscript is written clearly and concisely in good English, and it has certain academic
value. I would recommend publication of the article if the authors are willing to proceed to a few
changes/additions/corrections/ answers indicated below.
P3L43, why do you only add chemical additives into cathode electrolyte? Please add your
explanation in manuscript.
P3L56, what does the leaching efficiency refer to? How do you test and calculate? It’s not clear,
please add relatedly information in your manuscript.
P5L17, Explain why the electrolyte solution in anode compartment became darker with passage
of time, and please add your reasons in your manuscript.
P5L21, besides precipitation of heavy metal ions, I believe the tested soil became hardened is
mainly because of volatilization of soil moisture caused by thermal effect.
P5L41, the absolutely decrease of ion concentration and quantity in the system may be the main
reason, please you rethink the reason why the lowest current was observed in A5 group.
P5L58, please delete or correct the sentence “which indicated that soil was alkaline in nature and
had strong pH buffering capacity”; the logic is incorrect, and tested soil properties is not derived

Reviewer Recommendation and Comments
The manuscript “Effect of chemical additives on electrokinetic remediation of
Cr-contaminated soil coupled with a permeable reactive barrier” is clear and
follow a logic path. However, before it was accepted for publication in this journal,
there are some questions.
1. There were a few similar researches of the remediation of Cr-contaminated soil by
EKR-PRB coupled technology. Moreover, the same material (zeolite and
zero-valent iron) had also been used in the EKR-PRB remediation of
Cr-contaminated soil in the paper entitled “Electro-kinetic remediation of
chromium-contaminated soil by a three-dimensional electrode coupled with a
permeable reactive barrier. Rsc Advances, 2017. 7(86): 54797-54805”. To
distinguish this research from previous studies, authors should add some more
information to show the innovation of this research, in the introduction.
2. The specific analytical methods for Cr(VI) concentration in the soil have been
missed. And Cr(III) concentration need be obtained during the experiment.
3. Regarding analytical methodologies. Were some validation parameters (e.g.
recovery experiments, LOD, LOQ) carried out? The recovery experiments by
adding standard Cr samples should be carried out. What was the
average recovery ratio?
4. Can authors close the mass balance of total Cr in the experiments? Most likely it
is done but should be mentioned in the text. Please check other articles as example.

Dear reviewers,
We would like to express our sincere appreciation for your careful reading and helpful comments.
Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as
the important guiding significance to our researches. We have addressed the points.
Responses to Reviewer #1:
Comment 1: There were a few similar researches of the remediation of Cr-contaminated soil by
EKR-PRB coupled technology. Moreover, the same material (zeolite and zero-valent iron) had also
been used in the EKR-PRB remediation of Cr-contaminated soil in the paper entitled “Electro-kinetic
remediation of chromium-contaminated soil by a three-dimensional electrode coupled with a permeable
reactive barrier. Rsc Advances, 2017. 7(86): 54797-54805”. To distinguish this research from previous
studies, authors should add some more information to show the innovation of this research, in the
introduction.
Reply: Thank you for your valuable comments. Although zeolite has been widely used as PRB
materials, its adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) anions is limited by its native surface characteristics. These
negatively charged zeolite can be further modified with cationic surfactants to form micelle-like bilayer
structures, changing the zeta potentials, therefore enhancing the adsorbing capacity of anions. To
further improve the adsorption capacity, the zeolite in this study was modified with cetyl trimethyl
ammonium bromide (CTMAB), resulting in a better performance. Now, we have added some
information to show the innovation of this research in the introduction section according to your
guidelines. Now you can see on page (2) at the line (26-35).
Comment 2: The specific analytical methods for Cr(VI) concentration in the soil have been missed.
And Cr(III) concentration need be obtained during the experiment.
Reply:(1) we have added the specific analytical methods for Cr(VI) concentration, which can be found
in section 3.5(page: 3, line: 39-41; page: 4, line: 1-2).
(2)The concentration of Cr(III) in soil was indirectly determined by measuring the
concentration difference between the total Cr and the Cr(VI). The concentration of total Cr in soil was
determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer(ICP-OES). The initial concentration
of total Cr and Cr(III) in soil were 36475.32 mg/kg and 35971.32 mg/kg respectively. Now, we
presented the date of total Cr and Cr(III) in the two replicates of experiments under the optimum
combination, which was shown in the following table.
The concentration of total Cr and Cr(III) under the optimum combination
Total Cr concentration(mg/kg) Cr(III) concentration(mg/kg)
Group S1 S2 S3 Average S1 S2 S3 Average
C1 33245.61 33682.81 35246.67 34058.37 33136.39 33570.69 35183.89 33963.66

This paper focuses more on the remediation efficiency of Cr(VI) instead of total Cr and Cr(III).
From the viewpoint of removal rate, the removal rates of total Cr and Cr(III) are low due to their
chemical stability and resistivity of migration. According to the above table, even under the optimal
conditions, the removal rates of total Cr and Cr(III) are relatively low, the average removal rate of total
Cr and Cr(III) were 6.53% and 5.49% respectively. Luckily, the Cr(III) is stable in the soil and its low
toxicity brings less impact on the safety of environment. On the other hand, the concentration of Cr(VI)
is critical due to its high toxic, although it only represents a small part of total Cr. The remediation
efficiency of Cr(VI) is high as it is easy to migrate with EKR. Overall, this paper discussed the Cr(VI)
removal rate and leaching toxicity as the main indicators, but did not consider the two indicators of
total Cr and Cr(III).
Comment 3: Regarding analytical methodologies. Were some validation parameters (e.g. recovery
experiments, LOD, LOQ) carried out? The recovery experiments by adding standard Cr samples should
be carried out. What was the average recovery ratio?
Reply:(1) The LOD in this experiment was 0.007ug/ml, and the LOQ was 0.023 ug/ml.
(2) We used K2Cr2O7 and kaolin to prepare the simulated soil with the Cr(VI) concentration of
500 mg/kg. The experiment was carried out under the condition of a voltage gradient of 2.0V/cm,
repair time of 5d. The average removal rate of Cr(VI) reached 90%. Therefore, it can be concluded that
the EKR has a good effect on the remediation of the simulated soil. Based on this, the actual soil was
studied in this paper..
Comment 4: Can authors close the mass balance of total Cr in the experiments? Most likely it is done
but should be mentioned in the text. Please check other articles as example.{such as “J.G. Han, K.K.
Hong, Y.W. Kim, et al. Enhanced electrokinetic (E/K) remediation on copper contaminated soil by
CFW (carbonized foods waste),Journal of Hazardous Materials,177 (2010) 530-538”}.
Reply: In this paper, we used actual Cr-contaminated soil which had a high total Cr content and our
research focused on the Cr(VI). After the experiment, the removal rate of Cr(VI) was very high, but
more than 90% of total Cr remained in the soil after the experiment. On the other hand, it is difficult to
measure the heavy metal precipitation in the PRB and cathode regions. Therefore, we directly disposed
of the waste without analyzing the total Cr in each part. Thanks for your advice, we have found our
shortcomings in my current work. We will improve my scientific research level in accordance with
your suggestions in future work and make more achievements!
Responses to Reviewer #2:
Comment 1: The manuscript is not well written, many poor sentence construction and grammatical
errors. It is strongly recommended that the manuscript is further revised or reviewed by colleagues with
English as first language as it is sometimes hard to understand.
Reply: Thank you for your advice. We have made a detailed revision to the manuscript and we hope
these will be satisfactory.
Comment 2: What type of soil was used in this study? Please classify.
Reply: The soil was derived from a chemical plant which produced chromium salts. According to the
date of XRF(Table 4), the major elements in soil are Ca<U+3001>O<U+3001>Si<U+3001>Cr etc. The Cr(VI) content(504 mg/kg)
of the soil is high and the soil is classified as solid waste according to the environmental quality
standards for soils (GB15618-2008); According to the amount of sand, the soil is classified as loam;
Furthermore, according to the property of pollutants, the soil can be divided into inorganic pollutants -
heavy metal contaminated soil.
Comment 3: Lot of studies have been carryout on Cr contaminated soil and the some more recent
literature survey in this area is needed.It is always better to correlate the findings of the study with the
reported Literature.
Reply: Thank you very much for your advice. We have added more recent references the remediation
of Cr-contaminated soil in the introduction(page: 2, line: 11-15, line: 22-26). The references are given
below:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2017.01.092;

https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2017/ra/c7ra10913j
Comment 4: The error analysis of test data is needed
Rerly: Thank you for your valuable comments. Now, we have added the error analysis for two repeated
experiments under optimal conditions. The error analysis of the experiments was shown in Fig. 14.
Thanks for your comments.
Comment 5: The removal mechanisms of Cr(VI) is deficiency.
Reply: We have supplemented the removal mechanisms of Cr(VI) in section 5.1 and we hope these
will be satisfactory.
Comment 6 : The Cr morphology/forms is deficiency, other group soil is need.
Reply: we performed morphological analysis on all groups(having tween 80 or mixture) and the
parameters of morphology were close to each other. Considering the high performance, A4-S1 was
chosen as a typical region for the following experiment. It is reasonable to comprehensively understand
the migration of Cr and its effect on the remediation of environmental toxicity with the EKR. The
morphological comparison between the original soil sample and the A4-S1 group was also analyzed as
the exchangeable and carbonate fractions were decreased significantly and the residual fraction
increased after remediation.
Responses to Reviewer #3:
Comment 1 (P3 L43): Why do you only add chemical additives into cathode electrolyte? Please add
your explanation in manuscript.
Reply: Thank you for your comments. It was believed that catholyte can improve the remediation
effect by controlling pH and enhancing migration effect. We have explained the reason in section
3.4.2(page: 3, line: 27-28) and added some relevant references. The references are given below:
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.02.033;

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2005.05.040;
Comment 2 (P3 L56) : What does the leaching efficiency refer to? How do you test and calculate? It’s
not clear, please add relatedly information in your manuscript.
Reply: The leaching toxicity of solid waste refers to the concentration of pollutants in the leaching
solution of soild waste obtained through a leaching procedure. The leaching toxicity of Cr(VI) in soil
was analysed through the ultraviolet Spectrophotometer after acid solution in accordance with the
Chinese standard HJ/T299-2007 solid waste leaching toxicity-sulphuric acid & nitric acid method.
The soil was mixed with acid solution(sulphuric acid and nitric acid, pH=3.20±0.05) and shaken at
room temperature for 18±2 h at a speed of 120 rpm, then the supernatant after filtering was measured.
Now, we have We have explained the leaching efficiency in section 3.5(page: 4, line: 3-8), thanks for
your comments.
Comment 3 (P5 L17) : Explain why the electrolyte solution in anode compartment became darker with
passage of time, and please add your reasons in your manuscript.
Reply: The electrolytic solution in the anode compartment became darker with a passage of time due to
the migration of Cr(VI) from the cathode to the anode under the action of the electric field during EKR.
We have added the reason in section 4.3.1(page: 5, line: 18-19). We thank you for this comment.
Comment 4 (P5 L21): Besides precipitation of heavy metal ions, I believe the tested soil became
hardened is mainly because of volatilization of soil moisture caused by thermal effect.
Reply: We confessed this point and the modifications have been done according to your valuable
comments, which could be seen in section 4.3.1(page: 5, line: 22-23).
Comment 5 (P5L41): The absolutely decrease of ion concentration and quantity in the system may be
the main reason, please you rethink the reason why the lowest current was observed in A5 group.
Reply: Thank you for your qualitative comments. The lowest current was observed in A5 group
(having 0.1% tween 80), and the low ion concentration in the system was due to less concentration of
ions dissolved from the tween 80. We have modified the reason in section 4.3.2 a(page: 5, line: 36-37)
according to your guidelines.
Comment 6(P5L58):Please delete or correct the sentence “which indicated that soil was alkaline in
nature and had strong pH buffering capacity”; the logic is incorrect, and tested soil properties is not
derived from EKR experiments.
Reply: Thank you very much for your valuable suggestion. In spite of higher migration rate of H+ than
OH-, the native alkaline environment of soil with strong buffering capacity caused the partially alkaline
pH of the S2 region. Now, we have correct it in section 4.3.2 b(page: 6, line: 6-7) according to your
guidelines.
Comment 7( P6L6): Have you given any thought to the reduction of Cr (VI) by dl-tartaric acid?
Reply: Before the EKR experiment, we soaked the soil samples with dl-tartaric acid and detected a
large amount of Cr (VI) in the solution, which indicated that the Cr (VI) was released in the soil under
the acidification of dl-tartaric acid. Combined with previous studies, it is mainly explained from the
acidification of organic acids. Therefore, this paper mainly considered dl-tartaric acid had controlled
the pH and acidification effect. The references are given below:

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.09.104;
Comment 8(P7L20): Did you characterize CTMAB-Z supported by Fe (0) after the reaction to verify
your reasoning?
Reply: After the experiment, SEM analysis of PRB showed that some some flocculent particles
appeared on the surface of the zeolite, and the experimental results were similar to the
reference(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11270-016-2790-6). As this paper mainly discussed
the remediation efficiency of Cr(VI) from a macroscopic perspective, the PRB material was not
analyzed in detail. In the future experiments, we will focus on the mechanism of PRB through more
in-depth experiments.
Comment 9(P7L31): Why do you choose samples in the A4-S1 region to analyze Cr morphology?
Please add your reason in manuscript.
Reply: The A4 group, especially A4-S1 region achieved the best results in the contrast experiments and
was picked up for the following experiments. By conducting the morphological analysis of this typical
region (A4-S1), it is reasonable to comprehensively understand the migration of Cr and its effect on the
remediation of environmental toxicity with the EKR. We have added the reason in section 5.2(page: 7,
line: 28-31). Thanks for your comments.
Comment 10(P7L41): Please simplify and improve the conclusion, and delete experiment processes
and methods which is written in the conclusion.
Reply: The conclusion had been revised in section 6 accordingly. Thanks for your comments.
