The influence of the substrate morphology on the biological performances of implant coating is
very important.In this study, by harnessing the adhesion and reactivity of bioinspired
polydopamine, nano-silver were successfully anchored onto micro/nanoporous and smooth
titanium surfaces. Then the physicochemical properties, antibacterial activity and
cytocompatibility of the resulting coating on both surfaces were assessed and analyzed. The
results implied that there was really no different in antibacterial activity between both surfaces,
but the nano-Ag-loaded dopamine coating on porous surface induced more mineralization than
on smooth surface, and then promoted osteoblast functions. This research makes sense, but some
questions need to be answered:
1. Why the ZOI size of S. aureus in Fig. 7 was so small?
2. Bacterial growth curves in Fig.8 showed that there were a little microbial growth in three kinds
of oral microbes after incubation for 24 h, why don’t you take 48h?

In the present study, the coatings with dopamine was fabricated on porous as well as smooth
titanium surfaces via immersion in a dopamine solution, then the Ag nanoparticles were coated
on a dopamine-modified surface using catechol oxidation of dopamine. In addition, the
physicochemical properties of the fabricated samples were determined by SEM, XPS, and water
3
contact angle tests, and the effect of the Ag nanoparticle coating on antibacterial effect and
MC3T3-E1 proliferation were also investigated. Though the data did suggest that there was no
significant difference in antimicrobial properties between both coatings, more mineralization
happened on the micro/nanoporous surface than on the smooth surface, and then mineralized
surface significantly enhanced osteoblast-compatibility. These study revealed the effect of
substrate morphology on physicochemical characterization and biological functions of the
coating. The following suggestions need to be considered:
1. This seems like a reasonably interesting and original article about modification of titanium
implants. However, one important thing is the practicability of the coating. How about the in
vivo experiment data in your study.
2. I am very interesting in the next step of you and your team, maybe you can tell me something
about what and how you do to further modify the titanium implants on the road of ‘from bench
to bed’.
3. This research is closely related to the surface modification of biomaterials, thus several
important references are suggested to introduce in the background, for examples the poly-
dopamine deposition and/or the self-clear surface.

Functionalizing Ti surfaces with polydopamine and silver nanoparticle is a valuable approach to
solving biomedical device-associated infection and lack of osseointegration. This work reported
the relationship between substrate morphology and biological performances of Ti surfaces with
nano-silver-loaded dopamine coatings. The ms is a concise, well-written report of original
research and the experiments were well thought out. However, there are a few technical
comments, below.
1. The source of chemicals and reagents need to be specified in the materials and method section.
2. Furthermore, the data suggested that the fabricated samples with Ag nanoparticle coatings
showed obvious toxicities. Therefore, the prepared materials with Ag nanoparticle coatings might
also bring the toxicities after implantation in vivo.

The influence of the substrate morphology on the biological performances of implant
coating is very important. In this study, by harnessing the adhesion and reactivity of
bioinspired polydopamine, nano-silver were successfully anchored onto
micro/nanoporous and smooth titanium surfaces. Then the physicochemical properties,
antibacterial activity and cytocompatibility of the resulting coating on both surfaces

antibacterial activity between both surfaces, but the nano-Ag-loaded dopamine
coating on porous surface induced more mineralization than on smooth surface, and
then promoted osteoblast functions. This research makes sense, but some questions
need to be answered:
1. Why the ZOI size of S. aureus in Fig. 7 was so small?
Response: There were differences in ZOI sizes of different bacterial because of the
different proliferative capacity and Ag sensibility of bacterial. Here, the minimum
ZOI size of S. aureus in Fig. 7 indicated that S. aureus had high proliferative capacity
and low Ag sensibility. But the aim of this study focused on the broad antibacterial
spectrum of nano-silver, but not proliferative capacity and Ag sensibility of bacterial,
so we didn't discuss these issues in detail.
2. Bacterial growth curves in Fig.8 showed that there were a little microbial growth in
three kinds of oral microbes after incubation for 24 h, why don’t you take 48h?
Response: Most researchers consider 24h as the finish point of this experiment. Here,
after incubation for 24 h with oral microbes, these results had demonstrated the
noticeable antimicrobial activity of nano-silver modified surfaces, so we didn't take
48h as the finish point

the in vivo experiment will be done later.
2. I am very interesting in the next step of you and your team, maybe you can tell me
something about what and how you do to further modify the titanium implants on the
road of ‘from bench to bed’.
Response: First, we will do the in vivo experiment to verify our idea. Second, the
relationship between the content of AgNPs on the surface and antibacterial activity
need to study. Because the number of bacteria in local environment in vivo don't get
107CFU, it is necessary to optimize the content of AgNPs on the surface by the in
vivo experiment. Third, we will make this surface absorb some proteins (e.g.
Fibronectin or Laminin) to improve osteoblast-biocompatibility.
3. This research is closely related to the surface modification of biomaterials, thus
several important references are suggested to introduce in the background, for
examples the poly-dopamine deposition and/or the self-clear surface.

1. The source of chemicals and reagents need to be specified in the materials and

Response: Thank you for reviewer’s suggestion. The source of chemicals and

2. Furthermore, the data suggested that the fabricated samples with Ag nanoparticle
coatings showed obvious toxicities. Therefore, the prepared materials with Ag
nanoparticle coatings might also bring the toxicities after implantation in vivo.
Response: It is a good question. The data showed that this coating did not favor
osteoblast attachment, proliferation and differentiation, however we found that the
mineralized surface of this coating stimulated the proliferation of osteoblast and
enhanced ALP activity. Therefore, we hope that the coating with dopamine and
AgNPs can be effective against bacterial infections and facilitate mineralization
during the early post-operative period and then can promote osseointegration due to
the good osteoblast-biocompatibility of the mineralized surface. After getting
permission, we will do experiment in vivo later.
