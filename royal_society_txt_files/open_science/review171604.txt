This study aims to investigate the relationship between climatic yearly variations and
reproduction of a resident songbird (mountain chickadee). As the study is conducted on breeding
population at two different altitudes (1900 an 2400m) in the Sierra Nevada, this provides an
interesting starting point to compare a larger range of climatic variations, on populations facing
different constrains. While the study holds a very interesting data set, it does not reach its full
potential in the way it currently analyses and presents the data. Although the writing style is
certainly not bad, the results section is overly long and complicated due to a lack of focus. Figures
also become difficult to understand and should be presented differently in my opinion. The
discussion misses focus and has some trouble placing the findings in perspective with relevant
literature. I believe the data set and concept of the study certainly has merit, but I would analyse
the data in another way and give a more clear focus to the study itself.
The climate data is related to the data on bird reproduction by ranking the years in which the
study was conducted along a climatic gradient. Reproduction data are thus analysed by putting
(ranked) year as independent variable. By doing so, although you don’t have to correct for time
anymore, you lose the extent of variation in climate between years, and you cannot investigate
the correlation between reproduction and climate. Rather than ranking years, I would take the
climatic data of the years in your study, and use linear mixed models in which you analyse
reproduction variables over climatic variables, including year (and maybe also nest box number)
as random factors. In this way, you can uncover to what extent for example lay date depends on
snow depth or temperature, and whether this is different at different elevations. You note in your
discussion that it would be interesting to now which cues chickadees use at different elevations,
and you actually have the data at hand to make a first step towards answering this question. Also
your figures will gain in clarity when putting the climatic variables in the x-axis, rather than
ranked years.
Currently your story is focused in the large yearly variations (see also your title), and although
climatic extremes are your interest, I think the current way the results and discussion is
represented doesn’t really answer this question. If you analyse your reproduction data over
climatic variations, for example focusing on snow depth, this could give you more handles to
frame your story around climatic extremes, rather than an in-depth study of differences in
reproduction parameters between years (as you now spend much of the results section on). Now
the discussion hardly puts your results in the background of other literature, and you rarely
relate back to other literature. As your introduction is stuffed with references, I do not think this
is because a lack of relevant literature.
Some detailed comments:
L. 44 - 46: rather strong statement which you cannot prove in my opinion.
L. 71 – 73: There certainly are studies on the effect of climatic extremes, see studies by M van de
Pol 2010 and 2017 for example. It would be good to refer to these as well as this seems the interest
of this study.
3
L. 78 – 81: I would say this is not the unique aspects of these mountain ranges, as this is the case
for every mountain range. Better point out that this is a very arid area, and then make your point
that snow may have a large impact on these conditions. Now the point is not very clear.
L. 88: Why initial?
L. 99: “food-caching” and “that store food” is double.
1st paragraph methods: There is some irrelevant information in here, while more interesting
information (on average laying date for example) is missing.
L. 109 – 113: better move this forward to the part where you discuss the climatic variables. Also
make clear that you are talking about winter – spring weather
L. 121: How far where the SNOTEL stations from your field site?
L. 134: I don’t understand the reasoning why you excluded August. This may not be part of the
breeding season, but the same holds true for September – December. Try to explain clearly why
you think it can be excluded. You might even choose only to include climatic data from January
onwards, as that is more likely to impact the future breeding season, while winter climate may
only affect survival.
L. 143: I am missing some information in this part of the methods section. How often did you
visit nests? How did you derive start of egg laying, as I gather you did not always record the date
of the 1st egg but sometimes had to derive this from the number of eggs present? Did you include
predated / abandoned nests in your measurements of nest success?
L. 146 – 148: Difficult sentence, hard to follow what you did.
L. 157: As said above, I would chance there analyses for linear mixed models. Also, when you
include year, it is unclear whether this is year as a time variable or as a factor.
L. 169: The results are very long and complicated. I have described above how you can change
this, but have some more specific comments. You start each paragraph by phrasing which factors
were significant. Although this is statistically correct, I am missing the biologically relevant
information. If year was a significant factor, than what implications does that have? In what
direction where the significant effects? It would help a lot if you would include climatic factors
rather than years.
Also, when you include lay date as a co-variate, this might help in clarifying the patterns you
find. For later lay dates at high elevations, chickadees lay the same clutches, indicating that lay
date alone does not explain clutch size or other reproductive variables. I would standardize your
lay date per elevation, and then include the deviation from this standardized lay date.
L. 287 – 293: as said before, I think these ‘ main findings’ can become much more clear if you do
the analyses differently, as you can make clear correlations between climate and reproduction.

This is an interesting manuscript addressing an issue of global significance. This study represents
a valuable contribution to the literature, and is well written, although it takes careful reading
because of the multiple analyses. There are some methodological issues that need to be clarified
and more information on the statistical analyses is required. Some aspects of the discussion also
need clarification. For example, you suggest that ‘climate extremes were negatively associated
with reproductive success at both high and low elevations, but low elevation chickadees had the
worst reproductive success in the largest drought year while high elevation chickadees had the
worst reproductive success in the heaviest snow year.’ What is your measure or reproductive
success here? As far as I can see this is not defined anywhere – perhaps I missed it. It can’t be
fledging success as shown in Figure 6 because those data are not consistent with the statement
above. Specific comments below.
In the analysis, you mention that ‘analyses were run with and without biologically relevant
covariates’ but you do not mention which. At least give an example here so we know what is
meant. As it stands only when you get to the results is apparent what this means.
In the statistical models, I think you should include year (categorical) as a random term because it
is important to account for differences in sampling effort between years. It is valid to include year
as both a random term and a covariate in this case. Similarly, if you have female ID, it should be
included as a random term, assuming that the same females are re-nesting between years.
It is not clear why you did not include data for second clutches for individuals at low elevation,
given you draw conclusions about reproductive success. Please clarify whether second broods are
associated with nest failure, rather than following successful fledging of a first brood.
I would like to see the Figures also drawn in chronological order by year, perhaps included in the
supplementary material. Because there can be carry-over effects on reproduction between years,
for example, via female body condition, it would be useful to view the graphs in year order. It
would also be easier to see how breeding was affected in the year following the drought.
Explain in the methods why you calculated fledging success in the manner you have.
Table 1. provide more information in the legend as to how to read this table.
5
Is there a reason to include Table S1 in the Supplementary material – seems more relevant as part
of the main text.
I think the implications of using nest boxes in this study needs some discussion. Nest boxes are
likely to influence thermal performance and therefore affect nestling growth and body mass. In
the natural situation, birds may choose nest sites that are appropriate to the climate conditions of
the year, with potential differences in nest site selection at different elevations. How might this
affect your results, particularly comparisons between birds breeding at different elevations?
Further are there any comparisons in the literature of breeding performance or nesting success for
chickadees nesting in natural cavities versus nestboxes at the same site?
Do you have any information on food caching, particularly in the extreme years, and how this
may have affected nesting success?
Do you have any information on recruitment of offspring, rather than simply fledging success?
I think you need to mention in the abstract that this study is restricted to individuals using nest
boxes.

In this revision the authors performed additional analyses to include random effects, included
more references in the discussion and fixed many details. However, the manuscript as a whole
remains very long and still misses focus. For example, the results and discussion are very
elaborate, in contrast to the abstract which focuses on the main finding (different impact of
climatic extremes for high vs. low elevation birds). I think this shows that by focusing on one
main finding, the paper would be very much improved. In the results, the original analyses have
not been replaced but mixed model analyses are additional, and the authors present 15 figures as
a result. All taken together, I think this paper is not suitable for publication in its current form.
The study would benefit from a much clearer focus – focusing on 2 or 3 reproductive traits
(laying date, clutch size and fledgling success) in relation to climatic extremes.
The abstract and introduction are clear and well-written. Methods contain sometimes repeated
information, but are otherwise clear. For the mixed effect models the paper looks only to
significance of parameters, where it would be better to evaluate different models by AIC values.
As described above, my main issue with the paper lies in the results section, which is overly long
and contains too many figures. The way to solve this would be to change the level of detail. The
same holds for the discussion, which is also overly long and misses focus.

In this revision the authors performed additional analyses to include random effects, included
more references in the discussion and fixed many details. However, the manuscript as a whole
remains very long and still misses focus. For example, the results and discussion are very
elaborate, in contrast to the abstract which focuses on the main finding (different impact of
climatic extremes for high vs. low elevation birds). I think this shows that by focusing on one
main finding, the paper would be very much improved. In the results, the original analyses have
not been replaced but mixed model analyses are additional, and the authors present 15 figures as
a result. All taken together, I think this paper is not suitable for publication in its current form.
The study would benefit from a much clearer focus – focusing on 2 or 3 reproductive traits
(laying date, clutch size and fledgling success) in relation to climatic extremes.
The abstract and introduction are clear and well-written. Methods contain sometimes repeated
information, but are otherwise clear. For the mixed effect models the paper looks only to
significance of parameters, where it would be better to evaluate different models by AIC values.
As described above, my main issue with the paper lies in the results section, which is overly long
and contains too many figures. The way to solve this would be to change the level of detail. The
same holds for the discussion, which is also overly long and misses focus.

s study aims to investigate the relationship between climatic yearly variations and
roduction of a resident songbird (mountain chickadee). As the study is conducted on
eding population at two different altitudes (1900 an 2400m) in the Sierra Nevada, this
vides an interesting starting point to compare a larger range of climatic variations, on
ulations facing different constrains. While the study holds a very interesting data set, it does
reach its full potential in the way it currently analyses and presents the data. Although the
ting style is certainly not bad, the results section is overly long and complicated due to a lack
ocus. Figures also become difficult to understand and should be presented differently in my
nion. The discussion misses focus and has some trouble placing the findings in perspective
h relevant literature. I believe the data set and concept of the study certainly has merit, but I
uld analyse the data in another way and give a more clear focus to the study itself.
climate data is related to the data on bird reproduction by ranking the years in which the
dy was conducted along a climatic gradient. Reproduction data are thus analysed by putting
nked) year as independent variable. By doing so, although you don’t have to correct for time
more, you lose the extent of variation in climate between years, and you cannot investigate
correlation between reproduction and climate.
> We initially, ran models with breeding parameters as a response variable and year and
vation and their interaction as predictor variables. Years were ranked for the purposes of
alization (figures) and these ranks were categorical (i.e. identical results are obtained if you
ranked year or chronological year as predictor variables). Year is a very important variable,
ond just snow (or any one climatic variable). The extremes of climate that are represented
hese data are described by meteorologists and climatologists as some of the worse
remes seen in the Sierra Nevadas in recorded history. So comparing years with extremely
erent and well defined climate patterns (done by national weather service) does allow
clusions about how climatic extremes may be related to differences in reproduction. As
h we have retained all analyses with year as a predictor variable.
wever, as suggested, we have presented the x-axis of all figures presenting data by year
onologically by year and included year rank (drought-snow) in parentheses next to each
r.
suggested, we have included mixed effects models with snow depth (mean from January to
e – this is likely the critical times for breeding; winter snow for its impact on moisture and
eding snow for its effects during the breeding season), elevation and their interaction as
d effects using year as a random effect for each of the reproductive parameters. It is
ortant to note that given that effects of the extremes are predicted to have similarly
ative effects, the predicted relationship between weather and breeding parameters are
en nonlinear.
her than ranking years, I would take the climatic data of the years in your study, and use
ar mixed models in which you analyse reproduction variables over climatic variables,
uding year (and maybe also nest box number) as random factors. In this way, you can
over to what extent for example lay date depends on snow depth or temperature, and
ether this is different at different elevations. You note in your discussion that it would be
resting to now which cues chickadees use at different elevations, and you actually have the
a at hand to make a first step towards answering this question. Also your figures will gain in
ity when putting the climatic variables in the x-axis, rather than ranked years.
> We did not use ranked years as a continuous variable in our analyses. Rather we used year
ntioned in the statistical analyses section) as a categorical variable. However, categorical
ks and categorical years are identical. Other than that, posthoc Tukey analyses provide
cific statistical answers whether years with specific weather patterns were different in any
roduction characteristics.
suggested by the reviewer, we have added mixed model analyses of each breeding
ameter with year as a random effect and snow depth, elevation, and their interactions as
d effects. We have also included figures that show weather parameters plotted on X-axis
breeding parameters on the Y-axis.
results do not allow us to tease apart specific cues used to begin breeding. All climate
iables are highly correlated (e.g. snow and temperature are negatively correlated with an r2
67) and multicolinear. It may be abundance of invertebrates per se that drives beginning of
eding at low elevation. As such, we only used snow depth in analyses as it has the largest
iation across years and elevation.
have altered the X-axis of graphs to be in chronological order by year rather than ranked by
ate severity.
rently your story is focused in the large yearly variations (see also your title), and although
atic extremes are your interest, I think the current way the results and discussion is
resented doesn’t really answer this question. If you analyse your reproduction data over
atic variations, for example focusing on snow depth, this could give you more handles to
me your story around climatic extremes, rather than an in-depth study of differences in
roduction parameters between years (as you now spend much of the results section on).
> All years reported in our study were unique in climate parameters and the extremes of
se years have been described by California climatologists as some of the most extreme in
orded history. By showing differences among years and using posthoc tests to test for
erences between specific years characterized by very specific weather parameters we
tainly can address the question whether reproduction differed between years with
remely different climate patterns.
suggested, we have also included mixed effect models with year as a random variable and
w depth, elevation and their interaction as fixed variables.
w the discussion hardly puts your results in the background of other literature, and you
ely relate back to other literature. As your introduction is stuffed with references, I do not
k this is because a lack of relevant literature.
> There are no data that we know of addressing resident birds experiencing extreme,
osite fluctuations in climate events (certainly along elevation gradients), but there is lots of
oretical studies and discussions. We have used these theoretical papers to put our data into
theoretical frame.
me detailed comments:
4 - 46: rather strong statement which you cannot prove in my opinion.
>> We have altered the sentence to read: “It is too early to make specific predictions
arding how increased frequency of extreme climate fluctuation may impact chickadees,
ever, our data suggest that even the most common species may be susceptible.”
1 – 73: There certainly are studies on the effect of climatic extremes, see studies by M van
Pol 2010 and 2017 for example. It would be good to refer to these as well as this seems the
rest of this study.
> We agree that there are studies on singular climatic extremes (and have included
erences such as van de Pol 2010). We, however, are largely focused on extreme swings in
ate not just singular extreme weather events and this has been rarely studied.
8 – 81: I would say this is not the unique aspects of these mountain ranges, as this is the
e for every mountain range. Better point out that this is a very arid area, and then make
r point that snow may have a large impact on these conditions. Now the point is not very
ar.
>> We have altered the sentence to say that “...are unique in that most of the moisture for the
r falls in the form of snow with more snow and moisture occurring at high elevation…” We
eve these are unique features of semi-arid mountains as many other mountains (e.g. the
palachians) are wetter mountains that do not rely on high elevation snow for breeding season
isture (as many of these places get a lot of moisture during the breeding season).
8: Why initial?
> We have removed the word initial
9: “food-caching” and “that store food” is double.
> Removed “food-caching”
paragraph methods: There is some irrelevant information in here, while more interesting
rmation (on average laying date for example) is missing.
> We have removed some irrelevant information, but we fail to see what “more interesting
rmation” would be included. The data on lay date for Sierra Nevada (Mccallum et al. 1999)
ased on unpublished data and as such it is unclear what elevations this is referring to.
itionally, lay date analyses for our sites are part of the analyses and therefore it does not
ke sense to report them in the methods.
09 – 113: better move this forward to the part where you discuss the climatic variables. Also
ke clear that you are talking about winter – spring weather
> We have moved this to the climate data section as suggested. It does not apply specifically
winter – spring weather (although that is where the most dramatic differences are). For
mple, Aug and Sept precipitation. We are talking about yearly climate over all. However, we
uded that the climate is most dramatically different during winter/spring.
21: How far where the SNOTEL stations from your field site?
> The station at our high elevation site is exactly in the middle of our site and two stations
used for low elevation are 4.5 and 6 km away from our low elevation site (but all at the
e elevation within continuous forest). We have added these data.
34: I don’t understand the reasoning why you excluded August. This may not be part of the
eding season, but the same holds true for September – December. Try to explain clearly why
think it can be excluded. You might even choose only to include climatic data from January
wards, as that is more likely to impact the future breeding season, while winter climate may
y affect survival.
> We have added August into weather graphs and analyses. For analyses of breeding
ameters, we have only included the snow depth from Jan-June as this is likely the most
ortant time period for breeding in our area (as a result of snow accumulation during winter
its contribution to soil moisture during breeding)
43: I am missing some information in this part of the methods section. How often did you
t nests? How did you derive start of egg laying, as I gather you did not always record the
e of the 1st egg but sometimes had to derive this from the number of eggs present? Did you
ude predated / abandoned nests in your measurements of nest success?
> Nest boxes were visited several times a week until eggs were detected. If there were more
n one egg in the nest we estimated the date of the first egg based on one egg laid per day.
then detected when incubation started by assuming that it starts after the last egg was laid.
ce we estimated incubation start, we started checking the nests every day after 13th day of
ubation until we detected hatching. After that, we visited nests on day 16 (15 days after
ching) to weigh and band the young and after day 30 to make sure the young fledged. These
tences have been altered and expanded
dated nests were used in nest success estimates. If we excluded the predated nest our
ging success measure would essentially be the same as analyzing brood size with a clutch
covariate. For this analysis, we were more interested in seeing how a given amount of
estment in a clutch translated into successful fledglings and this is common place in many of
studies of avian breeding biology.
46 – 148: Difficult sentence, hard to follow what you did.
> Sentence has been broken up and expanded upon.
57: As said above, I would chance there analyses for linear mixed models. Also, when you
ude year, it is unclear whether this is year as a time variable or as a factor.
> Year was always used as a categorical variable. We have also included LMM with year as a
dom effect, as suggested.
69: The results are very long and complicated. I have described above how you can change
, but have some more specific comments. You start each paragraph by phrasing which
tors were significant. Although this is statistically correct, I am missing the biologically
vant information. If year was a significant factor, than what implications does that have? In
at direction where the significant effects? It would help a lot if you would include climatic
tors rather than years.
> We always followed all main results with posthoc tests associated with climate-related
elevation-related explanations. As such we linked differences to particular climate patterns
ociated with specific years and so we attempted to interpret all specific differences directly
elation to specific climate associated with different years.
ile we have retained analyses based on year differences, we have also added LMM models
h snow depth, elevation and their interaction as a fixed effect and year as a random effect.
o, when you include lay date as a co-variate, this might help in clarifying the patterns you
. For later lay dates at high elevations, chickadees lay the same clutches, indicating that lay
e alone does not explain clutch size or other reproductive variables. I would standardize
r lay date per elevation, and then include the deviation from this standardized lay date.
> We use elevation as a factor and a lay-date as a covariate, which estimates the
tionship between the dependent variable and a lay date WITHIN each elevation separately.
87 – 293: as said before, I think these ‘ main findings’ can become much more clear if you
the analyses differently, as you can make clear correlations between climate and
roduction.
> Given that all 5 years differed significantly in climate ranging between the two opposite
remes, that more than one climatic variable is varying, that climatic variables are highly
related/multicolinear (e.g. temperature and snow depth), and that most studies on the
cts of environmental variables include year as a categorical predictor and proxy for the
iable of interest, we feel that using year as a predictor variable makes intuitive sense and
ES address our driving hypotheses.
suggested, we have included a LMM with year as a random effect and a climate variable
uded in the fixed effects, which all support our main conclusions.

s is an interesting manuscript addressing an issue of global significance. This study
resents a valuable contribution to the literature, and is well written, although it takes careful
ding because of the multiple analyses. There are some methodological issues that need to
clarified and more information on the statistical analyses is required. Some aspects of the
ussion also need clarification. For example, you suggest that ‘climate extremes were
atively associated with reproductive success at both high and low elevations, but low
vation chickadees had the worst reproductive success in the largest drought year while high
vation chickadees had the worst reproductive success in the heaviest snow year.’ What is
r measure or reproductive success here? As far as I can see this is not defined anywhere –
haps I missed it. It can’t be fledging success as shown in Figure 6 because those data are not
sistent with the statement above. Specific comments below.
> We made all results very specific – in most case only some variables showed very large
erences – like clutch size and lay start.
dging success is not a measure of reproductive success in this study – it is a measure of how
ny chicks fledged given the initial investment for a given clutch size. Overall pre-fledging
od size is the best proxy for reproductive success in our data. The more fledglings = the
her the reproductive success, irrespective of clutch size or other parameters. What we found
s that both clutch size and brood size varied among the years – smaller clutches and smaller
ods were observed during extreme years. But since both clutch and brood size varied,
ging success (number of eggs/number of fledglings) stayed rather constant.

ariates’ but you do not mention which. At least give an example here so we know what is
ant. As it stands only when you get to the results is apparent what this means.

he statistical models, I think you should include year (categorical) as a random term because
important to account for differences in sampling effort between years. It is valid to include
r as both a random term and a covariate in this case. Similarly, if you have female ID, it

rs.

e included a statement as such in the statistical analysis section). We did not have female ID
il later seasons and as such, we cannot include Female ID as a random term.
suggested, we have added new analyses with year as a random variable in mixed effect
dels with snow depth and elevation as fixed effects. These analyses confirm our conclusions.
not clear why you did not include data for second clutches for individuals at low elevation,
en you draw conclusions about reproductive success. Please clarify whether second broods
associated with nest failure, rather than following successful fledging of a first brood.
> We were specifically interested in differences in first reproduction. High elevation birds
er had second clutches and at low elevation we only use the term ‘second’ clutches when
s bred second time after successfully finishing the first breeding event and this only
urred in one season (with the exception of 1 or 2 nests in one other season) and this season
s the average climate year (2015-16).
ould like to see the Figures also drawn in chronological order by year, perhaps included in
supplementary material. Because there can be carry-over effects on reproduction between
rs, for example, via female body condition, it would be useful to view the graphs in year
er. It would also be easier to see how breeding was affected in the year following the
ught.

ate rank of each year in parenthesis.

tract: Evidence suggests we are experiencing rapidly accelerating global climate change.
derstanding how climate change affects life and biodiversity is critical to identifying species
populations that are vulnerable. Most current research focuses on investigating how
anisms respond to gradual warming, but another effect of climate change is extreme annual
iation in precipitation associated with alternations between drought and unusually heavy
cipitation, like that exhibited in the western regions of North America. Understanding
ate change effects on reproductive behavior is especially important, since it directly
acts population persistence. Here, we present data on reproduction in resident mountain
ckadees inhabiting high and low elevations in the Sierra Nevada across five years. These five
rs of data represent the full range of climatic variation from the largest drought in five
turies to one of the largest snow years on record. There were significant differences in most
roductive characteristics associated with variation in climate. Both climate extremes were
atively associated with reproductive success at both elevations, but low elevation
ckadees had the worst reproductive success in the largest drought year while high elevation
ckadees had the worst reproductive success in the heaviest snow year. Considering that the
quency of extreme climate swings between drought and snow is predicted to increase, it is
sible that such swings can have negative effects on chickadee populations across the entire
vation gradient, as climatic extremes should favor different adaptations. Alternatively, it is
sible that climate fluctuations might favor preserving genetic variation allowing for higher
lience. It is too early to make specific predictions regarding how increased frequency of
reme climate fluctuation may impact chickadees, however, our data suggest that we should
concerned, even about the most common species.

r Editors,
nk you for evaluating our manuscript and for allowing us to resubmit a revised version. We
reciate the reviewer’s point of view and suggestions. We have made many of these
gested changes. More specifically, we have reduced the number of figures to 7 (from 16 in
original manuscript) by eliminating figures with values adjusted for covariates and by
bining the figures that plotted each response variable against yearly variation and snow
els into the same panels (two panels per graph for each variable).
Having panels allows directly comparing both yearly variation along consecutive years
variation associated with snow levels on a continuous scale. We strongly feel that keeping
h yearly variation and variation associated with a continuous snow levels is the most
rmative way to present the data given that in our case entire years are regularly quantified
ed on a drought-snow scale by official US weather service. Therefore, each year is
ociated with a unique climate pattern and comparing reproduction among years ranging
ween the two opposite extreme climate patterns is highly informative. We have shorted the
ults further by compressing the amount of comparisons.
We strongly disagree with the reviewer that we should focus on just 2-3 variables to
rove focus. All variables we measured can be affected by climate independently and each
asure is associated with fitness. For example, pre-fledging mass that the reviewer suggested
rop, is well documented to have a direct effect on survival, recruitment and hence on
ess. Even when there are no differences in brood sizes, differences in pre-fledging mass
uld result in differential reproductive success and fitness. We just do not see how removing
hly meaningful reproductive measures can improve the focus of the paper.
Overall, we find the reviewer’s criticism that our results are too long somewhat strange.
presented all results and all pairwise analyses that are all necessary to test which specific
erences are significant. Our Results section contains no other information, but the statistical
lyses of main reproduction variables. The reviewer seems to think that by just dropping
e biologically relevant measures (such as pre-fledging mass) would make the Results more
used, but that does not seem to make any sense to us. All variables we analyzed are always
d in analyses of breeding in birds and all have been well documented as important measures
ted to fitness. We are not sure why focusing on just 2 parameters and dropping others
en all of them were significantly associated with variation in climate would make a better
us when our aim is to understand how extreme variation in climate might affect
roductive success and hence fitness. We have specifically selected to submit to Royal Society
en Science because it does not have requirements for shorter manuscript. Our manuscript is
ger because we present more data, not because we discuss irrelevant things.
The Reviewer did not state that our analyses were incorrect or that our interpretation of
ults was incorrect, only that we had an overly lengthy Results section. We have removed
f of all Figures and we would be happy to move additional analyses and/or figures in
plementary material, if that is preferable. Additionally, we feel that our results section
uld not benefit from an AIC table. AIC is useful for looking at how many potential predictors
te to a specific response and to select the most parsimonious model that explains the most
iation. In our case, we have very specific predictions, all models have the same number of
iables, and most importantly, our response variables are different for each reproductive
ameter. An AIC table, in this situation, would not be useful in addressing whether and how
rly climatic extremes and snow relate to each particular breeding parameter.
Overall, we feel that we have made most changes suggested by the reviewer by
rtening the Results and Discussion, re-structuring and streamlining the Discussion and by
oving many figures. We also feel that removing biologically relevant measurements that are
l known to affect fitness and which we showed vary with climate is counterproductive. We
l that our manuscript presents highly novel data that would be of broad interest considering
ent need to understand how changing climate might affect biodiversity and we sincerely
e that our revision is acceptable for publication.
Sincerely,

his revision the authors performed additional analyses to include random effects, included
re references in the discussion and fixed many details. However, the manuscript as a whole
ains very long and still misses focus. For example, the results and discussion are very
borate, in contrast to the abstract which focuses on the main finding (different impact of
atic extremes for high vs. low elevation birds). I think this shows that by focusing on one
in finding, the paper would be very much improved. In the results, the original analyses have
been replaced but mixed model analyses are additional, and the authors present 15 figures
result.
>> We have not removed the original analyses of yearly variation because they are
ortant data used to evaluate how reproduction varies among successive years, which is
ortant for evaluating any carry over and cumulative effects. These analyses and figures
re directly asked for by one of the previous reviewers. We have removed all figures with
usted values and combined yearly data and snow level data into the same panels for each
iable – now it is easy to evaluate both yearly variation and the association with specific snow
els on a continuous scale. In our opinion, such a combination provides the best way to
luate our results and to associate them with yearly variation in extreme climate. We
ngly feel that keeping both yearly variation and variation associated with a continuous snow
els is the most informative way to present the data given that in our case entire years are
ularly quantified based on a drought-snow scale by official US weather service. Therefore,
h year is associated with a unique climate pattern and comparing reproduction among years
ging between two opposite extreme climate patterns is highly informative. We have shorted
Results further by compressing the amount of comparisons.
taken together, I think this paper is not suitable for publication in its current form. The study
uld benefit from a much clearer focus – focusing on 2 or 3 reproductive traits (laying date,
ch size and fledgling success) in relation to climatic extremes.
>> We have shorted the paper considerably by leaving only 7 figures, by eliminating one
lysis and by shortening and streamlining our results.
respectfully disagree that we should focus only on the three suggested variables as it would
ove data and discussion of pre-fledging mass and variation in pre-fledging mass, which are
l known (and included in hundreds of papers evaluating breeding success) to be critical for
ruitment success and fitness. In addition, we report differences in these variables, which are
hly relevant.
do have a clear focus – it is how reproduction differs among years with extreme climate
iation, and we use the variables that have been used in pretty much all studies of
roduction. We simply do not see how removing biologically relevant data would make the
er more focused. Lay date, clutch and brood size, and pre-fledging mass are ALL important
dictors of fitness. Even when there are no differences in brood sizes, differences in pre-
ging mass would result in different reproductive success and fitness.
did remove analyses of ‘reproductive success’ which was a derived variable using clutch size
brood size and is therefore, already largely addressed in the analysis of brood size with
ch size as a covariate.
abstract and introduction are clear and well-written. Methods contain sometimes repeated
rmation, but are otherwise clear. For the mixed effect models the paper looks only to
ificance of parameters, where it would be better to evaluate different models by AIC values.
>> The goal of the paper is not to evaluate different models but to present the first available
a on how reproduction in a resident species varies with variation in extreme weather events
racterized MAINLY by differences in snow levels. Extreme climate fluctuations in American
st is well known and characterized by fluctuations in precipitation – mainly snow. In our
er, we directly test whether (1) different years characterized by official US weather services
m the most extreme drought to the most extreme snow year are associated with differences
eproduction and (2) whether variation in snow levels is directly associated with differences
eproduction at different elevations. These are simply and straightforward tests that allow us
est whether reproduction parameters varied among years with different climate. The most
ortant thing here is that we do not have alternative models that need to be compared for fit
each analysis has a different response variable and as such an AIC table would miss the
ire basis of our predictions and analyses.
described above, my main issue with the paper lies in the results section, which is overly
g and contains too many figures. The way to solve this would be to change the level of
ail. The same holds for the discussion, which is also overly long and misses focus.
>> We have removed half of the figures and combined the figures with yearly data and
w data into the same graphs so it is clear to see (a) yearly progression in reproductive
ameters allowing to see if there are potential carry over and cumulative effects and (b) the
ociation between snow levels and reproduction. The revised version contains only 7 figures
ompared to the 16 figures in the previous version. If deemed necessary, we would be happy
move additional analyses and/or figures to supplemental material.
have also revised the results and discussion by shortening them and making them more
used.
rall, we find the criticism that our Results are too long strange, and unjustified. We report
logically meaningful results –We fail to see why too many relevant results are a bad thing?
w having analyses of yearly variation when each year is classified along the drought-snow
tinuum by official US weather services is not informative? And how the Discussion miss the
in focus of our paper when it discusses ALL results in light of climatic variation? Our focus is
nterpret our results of how all well-known and biologically meaningful breeding parameters
y with differences in climate.
