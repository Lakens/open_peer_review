In this work, the authors studied the HDPE crystals epitaxially grown on the surface of
UHMWPE fibers. The experiments were well designed and the data discussion was well
presented. Overall I think this is a useful work for the research field of polyolefin based
composites. I only have some minor comments for the authors to address.
1. The introduction can be polished to highlight the challenge and novelty of this work. The
current introduction, though informative, is a little lengthy and it is not easy to understand the
highlight of this work.
2. How does the HDPE morphology affect the final mechanical performance of the composite?

The manuscript entitled `High density polyethylene crystals with double melting peaks induced
by ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fiber’ is very good work. Few points need to be
looked in to:
1. What is the rationale behind selecting 0.05 wt% HDPE in xylene for crystal growth?
2. `There is more regularly folded chain crystals induced by UHMWPE fiber’. It is expected that
3
there will be gradation of regularity from UHMWPE surface towards outside. Is it possible to get
more data or more theoretical analysis?
3. The work will have application on composites and others. There must be some efforts to find
out the mechanical properties.
4. How the study gives more information as compared to earlier reports?
The manuscript is recommended for major revision

Responses to Referee 1’ comments
Comment 1. The introduction can be polished to highlight the challenge and novelty
of this work. The current introduction, though informative, is a little lengthy and it is
not easy to understand the highlight of this work.
Response: Thanks for the suggestion. We compressed the Introduction section and
attempted to highlight the important points more clearly. Please see the Introduction
section in this version.
Comment 2. How does the HDPE morphology affect the final mechanical
performance of the composite?
Response: Thanks for mentioning this problem. The purpose of this paper is to
investigate the components and orientation of crystals of semicrystalline polymers
growth epitaxially on highly oriented substrate. The mechanism of transcrystallization
induced by high oriented fiber has been an extremely active subject over the past few
decades, but none of the current research involves the component gradient induced by
the oriented substrate. So we focused on the components of epitaxial crystallization in
this paper to obtain a full understanding of orientation-induced crystallization.
Responses to Referee 2’ comments
Comment 1. What is the rationale behind selecting 0.05 wt% HDPE in xylene for
crystal growth?
Response: Thanks for mentioning this problem. In this paper, we pay close attention
to the components of crystals grown epitaxially on the surface of oriented substrate.
The solution crystallization is an efficient method to study the morphology and
structure of crystals formed on external interface, which can thoroughly remove the
impacts of ontology crystallization. The higher concentration of the polymer solution
will still cause the ontology crystals gathering at the front of the crystal growth,
interfering the study on induced crystals. This is also confirmed by experiments. A lot
of ontology crystals formed and covered at the surface of fiber in 0.5 wt%
HDPE/p-xylene solution as shown in Figure 1. Our previous studies have shown that
0.05 wt% polymer solution concentration can form regular crystals on fillers1-3.
Therefore, the concentration was employed in this paper to produce HDPE crystals
induced by UHMWPE fiber.

Comment 2. `There is more regularly folded chain crystals induced by UHMWPE
fiber’. It is expected that there will be gradation of regularity from UHMWPE surface
towards outside. Is it possible to get more data or more theoretical analysis?
Response: Thanks for the suggestion. According to the process of experiments, we
found that double components of crystals from UHMWPE surface towards outside
almost formed simultaneously in a short period of time. Therefore, crystals of
different components can not be acquired respectively by the way of choosing
corresponding isothermal time. The step by step analysis by thermal treatment is the
simplest and most effective way to research the components. And the results in our
experiments, morphologies, orientation and thermal behavior of HDPE crystals before
and after treated, all confirmed double components.
Comment 3. The work will have application on composites and others. There must be
some efforts to find out the mechanical properties.
Response: Thanks for the suggestion. Our purpose of this paper is to investigate the
components and orientation of crystals of semicrystalline polymers growth epitaxially
on highly oriented substrate. The mechanism of transcrystallization induced by high
oriented fiber has been an extremely active subject over the past few decades, but
none of the current research involves the component gradient induced by the oriented
substrate. So we focused on the components of epitaxial crystallization in this paper to
obtaining a full understanding of orientation-induced crystallization.
Comment 4. How the study gives more information as compared to earlier reports?
Response: Thanks for mentioning this problem. Earlier reports about crystallization
induced by fiber focused on the induced transcrystallization morphology and
formation mechanism. The induced crystallization components has been investigated
quite scarcely. The component gradient formed in shearing flow can not represent that
producted by epitaxy because of the chain entanglement in shear field. Therefore,
none of the current research involves the component gradient induced by the oriented
substrate. Please find it from Introduction in this version.
