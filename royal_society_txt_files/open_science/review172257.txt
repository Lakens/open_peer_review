This article is about a new method of ammonia nitrogen removal using sediments from
malodorous river. The efficiency of ammonia nitrogen removal was evaluated and the
mechanism was also studied. The article is well discussed, and data analysis is clear, genuine and
believable. Some suggestions for improving the manuscript:
(1) In introduction part, please provide a reference to support that the malodorous phenomenon
in urban rivers is becoming increasingly serious in developing countries.
(2) Please provide more information about Liangshui River.
(3) The reference format should be checked.
(4) In data analysis part, please check equation (4).

calcinations, anaerobic or aerobic?
(6) In section 3.1, the author evaluated the ammonia nitrogen removal. Please compare the results
with other similar studies.
(7) In conclusion, the last sentence “This study provides a new method for the utilization of
sediment resources and a theoretical foundation for NH3-N control in malodorous rivers.”
However, the experiments were not conducted in the malodorous conditions. Please rewrite this

This study examined NH4-N adsorption by four different sediment materials, PS, PS-D, PS-Na
and PS-DNa. The authors have studied well and provided many data. However, there is a lack of

novelty. There are so many reports on NH4-N adsorption by sediments, soils and other materials.
Introduction section is not logical and not convincing. It requires substantial improvement.
P2, L11-18: I can not understand your target. Removal NH4-N from river water or sediment?
P2, L27-29: Your objective is to develop the large-scale method for NH4-N removal?
P3, L13-16 and P9, L29-33: I can not understand “control eutrophication according to the
inhibition of algae growth”. In this study, you examined the effect of sediment materials on algal
growth?
P3, L22: In this study, you used the sediment sample from a malodorous river. You have to show
the water quality of the river and sediment characteristic (organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus,
pH …). And, the sediment sample must be containing highly-rich NH4-N. How was release
NH4-N from sediment sample?
P9, L32: What is “a new method”? Enhancement/modification of NH4-N adsorption is already

clear, genuine and believable. Some suggestions for improving the manuscript:
(1) In introduction part, please provide a reference to support that the malodorous
phenomenon in urban rivers is becoming increasingly serious in developing
countries.
Response: The references were provided following the reviewer’s suggestion (Line
35-36).
(2) Please provide more information about Liangshui River.
Response: The information and the position of Liangshui River have been provided in
the part of Introduction, and we also added the longitude and latitude in the revised
manuscript (Line 68-73).
(3) The reference format should be checked.
Response: We checked and updated the reference format of citation.
(4) In data analysis part, please check equation (4).
Response: We revised the equation (4) following the reviewer’s suggestion (Line
146).
(5) In 2.1 section, PS-D was obtained according to calcination. What is the condition
for calcinations, anaerobic or aerobic?
Response: The calcinations condition was provided following the reviewer’s
suggestion (Line 89-90).
(6) In section 3.1, the author evaluated the ammonia nitrogen removal. Please
compare the results with other similar studies.
Response: Zeolite is a common material of NH3-N removal. Therefore, we compared
the removal efficiency and economic benefits of modified sediment with zeolite (Line
194-199).
(7) In conclusion, the last sentence “This study provides a new method for the
utilization of sediment resources and a theoretical foundation for NH3-N control in
malodorous rivers.” However, the experiments were not conducted in the malodorous

Response: In this study, we used the sediments from malodorous rivers to removal
NH3-N. Therefore, we referred that this study provides a new method for the
utilization of sediment resources. we used the modified sediments to remove NH3-N
in water, and the results can provides a theoretical foundation for NH3-N removal.
We rewrote the sentence following the reviewer’s suggestion (Line 291-293).

This study examined NH4-N adsorption by four different sediment materials, PS,
PS-D, PS-Na and PS-DNa. The authors have studied well and provided many data.
However, there is a lack of novelty. There are so many reports on NH4-N adsorption
by sediments, soils and other materials. Introduction section is not logical and not
convincing. It requires substantial improvement.
Response: As the reviewer referred, there were so many reports on NH3-N sorption,
such as natural or modified zeolite. In the revised manuscript, we compared the
removal efficiency and economic benefits of modified sediment with zeolite (Line
194-199). In addition, in this study, we emphasized the sediment reutilization from
malodorous rivers (Line 77-78, 291-293) in Introduction and Conclusion.
P2, L11-18: I can not understand your target. Removal NH4-N from river water or
sediment?
Response: Removing NH3-N from river water is the target of this study. The sediment
in malodorous river is a source of NH3-N. Therefore, in this study, we used the
sediment from malodorous river to produce the materials of NH3-N removal. On the
one hand, the object of the sediment reutilization can be achieved, and on the other
hand, the materials can be used to NH3-N removal in water. We also revised the
sentences in Introduction (Line 40-44).
P2, L27-29: Your objective is to develop the large-scale method for NH4-N removal?
Response: The existing technologies for NH3–N removal are difficult to apply to
large-scale engineering applications, particularly in malodorous rivers. Comparing
with these technologies, this study aims to provide theoretical basis or foundation for
NH3-N removal, and new insights into sediment reutilization from malodorous rivers.
We also referred in Introduction and Conclusion (Line 77-78, 291-293).
P3, L13-16 and P9, L29-33: I can not understand “control eutrophication according to
the inhibition of algae growth”. In this study, you examined the effect of sediment
materials on algal growth?
Response: Ammonia nitrogen (NH3–N) is an essential nutrient that limits primary
production in aquatic ecology, and as one of the main indexes of malodorous rivers,
NH3–N can lead to eutrophication (Line 37-38). Therefore we referred that “control
eutrophication according to the inhibition of algae growth” in the original manuscript.
In the revised manuscript, we have revised the sentences in Introduction (Line 75-77),
and deleted the sentence about algal growth in Conclusion.
P3, L22: In this study, you used the sediment sample from a malodorous river. You
have to show the water quality of the river and sediment characteristic (organic carbon,
nitrogen, phosphorus, pH …). And, the sediment sample must be containing
highly-rich NH4-N. How was release NH4-N from sediment sample?
Response: We provided a new table (Table 1) concluding the physicochemical
properties of water and sediment in Lingshui river (TP, TN, NH3-N, DO and pH), and
added the illustration in the revised manuscript (Line 102-103). The table numbers
were updated in the revised manuscript.
P9, L32: What is “a new method”? Enhancement/modification of NH4-N adsorption
is already known.
Response: The new method is for sediment resources: the sediment from malodorous
river was used for NH3-N removal. We also revised the sentence in Conclusion (Line
291-293).

Response: In the part of “Effects of temperature on the removal of NH3-N using
