Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
Elahi and Hasan present a new method for parameter estimation in the modelling of GRNs with
Hill functions. Overall, the approach seems to be valid and potentially useful. I am therefore
generally in favour of proceeding towards publication.
There are, however, several points that should be addressed before I am fully satisfied.
1. The Journal has a requirement that all code is made available. Clearly, implementing the fitting
algorithm involves a substantial program (which may even be useful to readers). This is not,
however, made available.
2. The language, whilst understandable, is awkward in places and should be edited.
(a) Articles "the" and "a" are not used in a natural way, and are often missing (eg. the sentence
beginning with "Large" at the top of p2 should start "The large").
(b) The authors frequently use "whereas" in an awkward way, after a full stop that separates the
two features being compared.
(c) "the and" on p6 should just be "the".
3. I recommend that the authors take some more time to explain how a beta-spline basis system
can be applied, both in general and in the specific case here. In particular, the authors don't
discuss the order of the spine used. Similarly, they simply state that 100 knots are used, without
explaining the meaning of "knot" or how this number was chosen, and how it might relate to the
number of available data points.
4. Similarly, the authors might discuss how they chose the parameter lambda (to which all
lambda_i are apparently set).
5. There are some notational issues around eq. 2.6.
(a) What is the subscript s? Shouldn't this be N?
(b) why does \dot{phi} have a subscript i in eq. 2.6?
(c) why is c_i not c_i^T in the second term in eq. 2.6?
(d) is it wise to use t as both a continuous and a discrete variable in the same equation?
6. In several tables and graphs, data is presented without units. The text is also to small on the
axes of the graphs in Fig. 5.
7. I strongly recommend that the authors make their captions more descriptive. Someone
glancing at a table or figure should be able to understand the context and conclusion that they
should draw without having to dig to deeply into the text. "Comparison of steady state values"
tells us almost nothing!
8. How fast is the convergence of the proposed method? Are there any benchmarks to which it
could be compared?

Decision letter (RSOS-171226)
06-Dec-2017
Dear Dr Hasan,
The editors assigned to your paper ("A method for estimating Hill Function Based Dynamic
Models of Gene Regulatory Networks") have now received comments from reviewers.
Both reviewers find the work of interest, but they both raise substantive issues that will need
careful consideration. These comments include making available any new code, and it will be
important to address this point as well. We would like you to revise your paper in accordance

Author’s response to reviewer comments
e are extremely grateful to reviewer for their time and insightful comments. We have considered each
comment and amended our manuscript accordingly. Our detailed response is as follows

hi and Hasan present a new method for parameter estimation in the modelling of GRNs with
functions. Overall, the approach seems to be valid and potentially useful. I am therefore
erally in favour of proceeding towards publication.
re are, however, several points that should be addressed before I am fully satisfied.
he Journal has a requirement that all code is made available. Clearly, implementing the fitting
orithm involves a substantial program (which may even be useful to readers). This is not,
ever, made available.
hor’s Response: The code has been made available on Dryad Digital Repository and reference in the
uscript.
he language, whilst understandable, is awkward in places and should be edited.
Articles "the" and "a" are not used in a natural way, and are often missing (eg. the sentence
inning with "Large" at the top of p2 should start "The large").
The authors frequently use "whereas" in an awkward way, after a full stop that separates the
features being compared.
"the and" on p6 should just be "the".
hor’s Response: The above mentioned issues have been resolved. The revised manuscript has also
n proof read to improve the writing.
recommend that the authors take some more time to explain how a beta-spline basis system
be applied, both in general and in the specific case here. In particular, the authors don't
cuss the order of the spine used. Similarly, they simply state that 100 knots are used, without
laining the meaning of "knot" or how this number was chosen, and how it might relate to the
mber of available data points.
hor’s Response: In the first paragraph of Section 2(b) the reason to use beta splines in GPM has
n mentioned. A reference is also given that extensively covers the beta-splines.
ara 2 of Section 4(b), the order is now mentioned. It is also elaborated that the choice of knots
ends on the required smoothness of spline functions.
imilarly, the authors might discuss how they chose the parameter lambda (to which all
bda_i are apparently set).
hor’s Response: All the \lambda_i are chosen as 150. The mistake has been corrected in Section
. \lamba_i are weighting factors. In most of the research problems, the choice of such weighting
ors is somewhat subjective. In this paper the \lamba_i depends on how much weight is given to the
terms in equation 2.6.
here are some notational issues around eq. 2.6.
What is the subscript s? Shouldn't this be N?
why does \dot{phi} have a subscript i in eq. 2.6?
why is c_i not c_i^T in the second term in eq. 2.6?
is it wise to use t as both a continuous and a discrete variable in the same equation?
hor’s Response: Thank you for identifying the mistakes in the equation. They have been corrected.
variable t is used as a continuous variable because derivatives are involved in the equation.
ever, the experimental data is available only for some discrete values of time. Therefore, in eq. 2.6,
summation is over some discrete values of t.
n several tables and graphs, data is presented without units. The text is also to small on the
s of the graphs in Fig. 5.
hor’s Response: We have included the units in figures and table. The text size in Fig. 5 has also
n increased.
strongly recommend that the authors make their captions more descriptive. Someone glancing
table or figure should be able to understand the context and conclusion that they should draw
hout having to dig to deeply into the text. "Comparison of steady state values" tells us almost
hing!
hor’s Response: Complied.
ow fast is the convergence of the proposed method? Are there any benchmarks to which it
ld be compared?
hor’s Response: The algorithm converges in 4 iterations of the loop shown in Fig. 3 in the
nuscript. The details have now been included Section 4(b). We haven’t compared the result with any
chmarks as our focus is on the accuracy of estimated model.
iewer: 2
mments to the Author(s)
ase add a discussion turning around the computational cost of the proposed algorithm, and
m the analysis of the cost, compare your proposal with some well-known existing algorithms
hor’s Response: We agree that computational cost is one of the considerations for any new
rithm, especially if the algorithm is online or executed in real-time. However, the estimation of models
RNs is usually done offline. Therefore, we have omitted a detailed analysis of computational
plexity and focused on the accuracy of the estimated model, which is of more significance.
ection 4(b) of the revised manuscript we have included the number of iterations that the algorithm
s to converge and the total execution time of the algorithm in MATLAB.
