label_comment_1
The Delaware Bay is an interesting and famous site for IAV epidemiology, where scores of Arctic
shorebirds stopover during spring migration to feast and refuel on horseshoe crab eggs. Contrary
to other sites where IAV in shorebirds have been investigated, this site gives rise to repeated
annual outbreaks of IAV in staging birds and it has been speculated that certain characteristics of
the site (ecology plus physical environment) contribute to this pattern. The manuscript by
Poulson et al. investigates how IAV can be maintained in the beach environment, and make a
very nice combination of observations, field sample collections and experimental testing of virus
survival in sand and water microcosms. I really like this approach where field observations are
put to test in a controlled experiment with biological relevance. Well done!
Generally, it is a well written paper with a good structure and clear thoughts; hence, my
comments are fairly minor and mostly relate to things that the authors could make clearer for the
reader.
My first comment relates to sand sampling methodology. If I understand the described methods
right, sampling sites are very close to each other – at least for the Kimbles Beach in 2012 where
transects were separated by only 1.5 m (it is less clear how close sampling points were for the
previous seasons/site). What was the rational for this? A potential concern is that if hosts infected
with IAV (or similarly uninfected) show an aggregative distribution this could affect your data on
how common/rare IAV are in different sites and zones. For example, could the 17 H13N6 viruses
from one of the sampling sites have resulted from a flock of infected gulls, rather than be an
indication of widespread infection of this subtype in shorebirds? Maybe this is not a big issue, but
at least I would like the authors to make the sampling description in the material and method
section at bit clearer – and potentially briefly discuss this also in the discussion.
My second comment relates to statistics and replication. In this study, the authors compare the
effects of pH and treatment (sand vs water) over time on survival for three different viruses,
expressed either as viral titers or Ct-values using linear mixed models. The results look
convincing and biologically relevant, but I just want to know if I have understood it right and
that the test meets assumptions. I am not a statistics wizard, so my comment may be moot. I was
just concerned that response variable(s) is logarithmic, and that there are no replicates either in
the measurement (Ct-value and titer) or in the treatment (i.e. one tube per virus/treatment/pH)
and that some data is missing (NT, ND in table 2). Is the data compatible with the linear mixed
model, or should other tests be applied?
My third comment relates to the sand treatment. It wasn’t really clear to me whether the sand
used in the experiment was completely dry or if it contained water. I assume it was dry, as it had
been stored for a long time. This has some potential for the biological relevance, as I assume that
sand in the tidal zone will retain quite a lot of water, and that the ability to virus containing-water
to move laterally is lower in such a medium compared to a dry medium. Did you test this also? It
would be worth doing, or at least discuss in the discussion.
And then some minor-minor comments:
Line 32. Word choice “enhance”. Consider use promote, enable or sustain.
Line 43-46. It is true that dabbling ducks are surface feeders, but this statement is perhaps a bit
too simplistic. Dabbling ducks differ in feeding modes between species as well as in diet choice
3
during the year, and will include both skimming of surface water, grazing of underwater
vegetation, predation of invertebrates as well as grazing on land.
Line 65-73. Similar for turnstones, these birds utilize an array of different foraging techniques,
from pecking, turning stones, routing seaweed to probing. At Delaware Bay, I assume that
probing may be more common than in other areas if they go crab eggs. Anyway, I suggest to
rephrase slightly to make clear to the reader that it is not only a probing shorebird.
Line 245. Take away the word unique.

ow are my responses (red indented text) to editorial comments (copy and pasted below, left
ified).
iewer comments (only those that require changes or comment are copy and pasted below)
Sand sampling methodology: If I understand the described methods right, sampling sites are very
e to each other – at least for the Kimbles Beach in 2012 where transects were separated by only
m (it is less clear how close sampling points were for the previous seasons/site). What was the
onal for this? A potential concern is that if hosts infected with IAV (or similarly uninfected) show
aggregative distribution this could affect your data on how common/rare IAV are in different sites
zones. For example, could the 17 H13N6 viruses from one of the sampling sites have resulted
m a flock of infected gulls, rather than be an indication of widespread infection of this subtype in
rebirds? Maybe this is not a big issue, but at least I would like the authors to make the sampling
cription in the material and method section at bit clearer – and potentially briefly discuss this also
he discussion.
We agree that the sand sampling methods, as initially written, were not very clear, nor detailed.
We have revised this section (now, lines 88-94) to include more dimensions (including spacing of
samples from one another) for the 2010, 2011, and 2012 (Pierces Point) sand sampling events.
The rationale behind the spacing of samples was based largely on our assumption that recovery
of virus directly from the environment at this stopover site would be difficult. We wanted to
sample at distinct intervals and locations in a concise and methodical way to maximize our
chance at recovering IAV.
We further agree with the reviewer that an aggregate of infected (or not) shorebirds or gulls
could affect interpretation of data as related to abundance of IAV at these locations. As s/he
suggested, the isolation of 17 H13N6 viruses in 2010 is most likely an artifact of a group of
infected gulls at these transect sites. As such, we have avoided making any predictions related
to subtype diversity, IAV prevalence, etc. from these environmental isolations. Instead, our goal
here was simply to show that with enough sampling, IAV can be isolated from the DE Bay
environment, and further, that IAV can be isolated at several centimeters depth from the
surface—of potential relevance as a transmission mechanism of IAV for shorebirds that feed by
probing substrate. To our knowledge, this is the first description of the isolation of IAV at sub-
surface levels of substrate at DE Bay. We have revisited sampling methodology in the
discussion, as suggested, and incorporated a sentence related to the limitations of this method
of transect sampling (lines 268-273): “Environmental samples were taken in close proximity to
one another, and it is possible that viral recovery could be influenced by an aggregation of
infected hosts, which was likely the case with the isolation of 17 H13N6 viruses in 2010. Because
of such potential sampling artifacts, it is not prudent to extrapolate to estimates of IAV
prevalence or subtype diversity from this environmental data.”
Statistics and replication: In this study, the authors compare the effects of pH and treatment (sand
ater) over time on survival for three different viruses, expressed either as viral titers or Ct-values
g linear mixed models. The results look convincing and biologically relevant, but I just want to
w if I have understood it right and that the test meets assumptions. I am not a statistics wizard, so
comment may be moot. I was just concerned that response variable(s) is logarithmic, and that
re are no replicates either in the measurement (Ct-value and titer) or in the treatment (i.e. one
e per virus/treatment/pH) and that some data is missing (NT, ND in table 2). Is the data compatible
h the linear mixed model, or should other tests be applied? (response also requested from
ociate Editor)
We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify the details of the statistical analysis. The
reviewer is correct that the response variables are logarithmic in nature, which in this case is the
most appropriate form of these variables for statistical analysis. In terms of replication, the
three different viruses constitute independent biological replicates, so for most of the treatment
and pH combinations there were n = 3 replicates at each time point. Virus was included in the
models as a random effect to account for the within-subjects nature of the treatment, pH, and
dpi variables. With respect to missing data at some of the individual time points, it may not
have been clear in our original description of the models that day post-inoculation was being
included as a continuous predictor. This helps to alleviate problems with missing observations
at individual time points as the observed values at other time points (and for other viruses) can
still be used to estimate the treatment effects.
We have added a sentence to the statistical analysis section to clarify how the normality and
homogeneity of variance assumptions were evaluated for these models, and we have also
attempted to clarify that day post inoculation was included as a continuous predictor (lines 179-
184). In our opinion, using a linear mixed model is the most appropriate way to analyze these
data. We did also consider using generalized estimating equations (GEE) linear models, which
are sometimes considered to be more robust than linear mixed models, but the statistical
conclusions were the same. Considering that GEE models may be less accurate with small
numbers of ‘clusters’ (i.e., viruses), we felt that using a linear mixed model approach would be
more appropriate on a theoretical basis.
Sand treatment: It wasn’t really clear to me whether the sand used in the experiment was
pletely dry or if it contained water. I assume it was dry, as it had been stored for a long time. This
some potential for the biological relevance, as I assume that sand in the tidal zone will retain
e a lot of water, and that the ability to virus containing-water to move laterally is lower in such a
dium compared to a dry medium. Did you test this also? It would be worth doing, or at least
uss in the discussion.
Yes, the reviewer is correct in assuming the stored sand was dry (the word “dry” has been added
to line 151 in the methods) and was not treated nor characterized (biologically, chemically, etc)
in any way prior to beginning the laboratory trial. We agree that the characteristics of sand and
water along the tidal zone would be very different than this artificial laboratory microcosm. The
laboratory sand was fully saturated with water upon addition of virus, but not beforehand. This
comment gets at the heart of the difficulty of this laboratory trial, and why we tried to keep it
simple. There are many unknown variables, beyond the scope of this study, that would make for
interesting follow-up work as related to the movement/retention of virus in substrate: effect of
grain size of sand, the role of biotic components in a natural system, virus binding to substrate,
electrostatic relationships, etc. We tried to cover the role of some of these mechanisms in the
discussion, but agree that the biological relevance of our laboratory persistence work needs to
be taken with, well, a grain of sand!
nor” comments:
Line 32. Word choice “enhance”. Consider use promote, enable or sustain.
The word “enhance” has been replaced by “enable”.
Line 43-46. It is true that dabbling ducks are surface feeders, but this statement is perhaps a
bit too simplistic. Dabbling ducks differ in feeding modes between species as well as in diet
choice during the year, and will include both skimming of surface water, grazing of
underwater vegetation, predation of invertebrates as well as grazing on land.
Thank you for this comment, and we agree that there are differences related to feeding
habits amongst the Anatinae. We have revised this sentence slightly so as not to imply
that feeding on surface waters is the only mode of foraging amongst this diverse group
of ducks. The sentence (now lines 43-47) now reads: “Dabbling ducks, which perpetuate
most hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes [1-3], employ a range of feeding techniques that
include skimming surface waters and grazing underwater vegetation; when in close
contact/high densities such as might be found on migratory staging areas, such feeding
behaviors could lead to enhanced transmission of IAV via the fecal-oral route [4].”
Line 65-73. Similar for turnstones, these birds utilize an array of different foraging techniques,
from pecking, turning stones, routing seaweed to probing. At Delaware Bay, I assume that
probing may be more common than in other areas if they go crab eggs. Anyway, I suggest to
rephrase slightly to make clear to the reader that it is not only a probing shorebird.
We agree with this comment as well. This sentence [now, lines 66-68] has been
rewritten to incorporate some of the other strategies utilized by foraging Ruddy
Turnstones, and now reads: “In addition to pecking and turning over stones, Ruddy
Turnstones also utilize a foraging behavior that involves probing several centimeters
into sand and cobble [14] in an effort to locate invertebrates, and when available,
buried horseshoe crab eggs [13].”
