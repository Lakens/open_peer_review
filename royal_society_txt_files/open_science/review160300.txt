Faulty eyewitness identification leading to wrongful conviction is a problem that we must do
more to eliminate. This is an important study that can (and should) change public policy in the
UK. The study is well-conducted, properly analyzed, and well-written. I have only minor
suggestions for revision.
The only concern about the manuscript is that the retention interval for the UK lineup was longer
than for the US lineup. I realize that both procedures had an interpolated 5 minute TETRIS
distractor, which mitigates my concern. I also realize that the differing retention interval could be
viewed as inherent to the US-UK procedures. Yet the greater delay could contribute to the worse
UK discriminability and calibration. I do not view this as a major problem, but would like the
authors to address it briefly in the Introduction. Prior studies that have explored the impact of
retention interval on performance could be helpful in that regard.
Page 2, line 28 The authors indicate that confidence is not routinely collected. I thought in the US
it typically was collected.
I was pleased to see that the same fillers were used across the US and UK lineups. Otherwise,
difference in lineup fairness could be responsible for the effects. I assume that for the US lineups,
that a different 6 of 9 fillers were selected for each participant, but the authors do not state how
they handled this.
5, 57 Please add why ROC is preferred when both correct and false ID rates are lower for the UK
lineups.
I was initially confused about the two SDT models that were applied to the data, one that was fit
to the data and one (a null model?) that required that d’ be constant between the US and UK
conditions. Please make clearer the purpose of this second model and what it is accomplishing
(around 7, 32).
8,47 Consider moving the bootstrap section to a footnote or to the Supplementary materials.
In the Discussion, describe a couple of additional differences between the two ID procedures that
may be contribute to the findings.

The authors pose the question: “Is there any difference in the extent to which US and UK lineup
procedures differ diagnostically?” This is an important and under-explored issue, and a
difference is not inconceivable given the rather different procedures: 6-person simultaneous in
the case of the US versus 9-person sequential in the UK. To investigate this issue they test a large
student sample. The results are clear-cut: ROC analysis suggests that the US lineup procedure
yields higher discriminability, and at the same time CAC analysis suggests higher reliability.
Overall this is a very careful piece of research on an important topic. The sample size is clearly a
major strength, alongside the thorough data analysis via the two main methods employed.
The authors make almost no reference to the finding that predictive value increases with
confidence (Fig. 2). Since the confidence-accuracy debate has been such a significant one in the
literature – and one that the second author has herself contributed to – this omission seems odd.
I found the second sentence of the Abstract rather inappropriate. The article itself makes no
mention of DNA exoneration of innocent suspects. Without some supporting citation or evidence,
the statement reads as rather polemical.
On a small point, the legend for Table 1 refers explicitly to target-present lineups, but the Table
includes both target-present and target-absent data.

The editors assigned to your paper ("US Lineups Outperform UK Lineups") has now received
comments from reviewers. We would like you to revise your paper in accordance with the
referee and Subject Editor suggestions which can be found below (not including confidential
reports to the Editor). Please note this decision does not guarantee eventual acceptance.
Please submit a copy of your revised paper within three weeks (i.e. by the 24th July 2016). If we
do not hear from you within this time then it will be assumed that the paper has been withdrawn.

In exceptional circumstances, extensions may be possible if agreed with the Editorial Office in
advance.We do not allow multiple rounds of revision so we urge you to make every effort to
fully address all of the comments at this stage. If deemed necessary by the Editors, your

Associate Editor's comments:
Dear Dr Mickes,
We have now received the reviews of your manusript. As you will see both reviewers are
positive, both regarding the scope of the work and regarding its execution. They do provide some
valuable advice, which I believe needs to be addressed and which would improve the work.
I should like to emphasise in particular the request to clarify the purpose and contribution of the
models used (reviewer 1), and the request to temper the description of issues that are not
explicitly addressed in the work itself (reviewer 2).
I trust you will be able to address all of the reviewers' comments and suggestions
straightforwardly, and I look forward to receiving the revised manuscript.
Thank you for submitting your work to RSOS.

like the authors to address it briefly in the Introduction. Prior studies that have
explored the impact of retention interval on performance could be helpful in that
regard.
This is a very interesting point. Because the inherent differences in
retention intervals are on average about 1 minute, it seems like unlikely
that this accounts for the differences, but it is a point worth noting. And we
do so now.
Page 2, line 28 The authors indicate that confidence is not routinely collected. I
thought in the US it typically was collected.
This is a good point, and is now corrected. Despite the fact that confidence
is often collected in the US during the initial identification, later in courts,
jurors are often instructed to ignore statements of confidence. We
considered adding this, but did not want to detract from the main message
of the paper.
I was pleased to see that the same fillers were used across the US and UK lineups.
Otherwise, difference in lineup fairness could be responsible for the effects. I
assume that for the US lineups, that a different 6 of 9 fillers were selected for
each participant, but the authors do not state how they handled this.
You are correct! This important detail has now been added to the Method
section.
5, 57 Please add why ROC is preferred when both correct and false ID rates are
lower for the UK lineups.
We have added that this pattern may reflect a difference in response bias,
not necessarily in discriminability, which is why ROC analysis needs to be
conducted.
I was initially confused about the two SDT models that were applied to the data,
one that was fit to the data and one (a null model?) that required that d’ be
constant between the US and UK conditions. Please make clearer the purpose of
this second model and what it is accomplishing (around 7, 32).
We added a sentence clarifying the purpose of performing the second
model fit. Because the fit is significantly worse when d' is constrained to be
the same for both procedures means that the procedures differ in
discriminability. That result is in agreement with ROC analysis.
8,47 Consider moving the bootstrap section to a footnote or to the
Supplementary materials.
We did consider moving the bootstrap section to a footnote, but it was too
long. Then we considered moving the section to Supplementary materials,
but it seems too short. We will leave it for now, but happy to change based
on the editor’s recommendation.
In the Discussion, describe a couple of additional differences between the two ID
procedures that may be contribute to the findings.
Done.

Great point. We have added that PPV increases with confidence, consistent
with recent findings.
I found the second sentence of the Abstract rather inappropriate. The article

We added the appropriate citation.
On a small point, the legend for Table 1 refers explicitly to target-present lineups,
