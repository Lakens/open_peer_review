The manuscript describes the results of the computer simulations of nanoparticle uptake across
phospholipid membrane. The authors used continuum description together with an elastic theory
to evaluate the changes of membrane wrapping time caused by different ligand distribution on
the nanoparticle surface. The wrapping is found to be the fastest in the case of homogeneous
distribution. This is a useful and important finding.
The main issue of this manuscript is that the effect has been investigated and published before –

In the manuscript, the authors reported a statistical dynamics model of receptor-mediated
endocytosis to examine the influences of the distributions of ligands on the cellular uptake
process. Three cases, i.e., the harmonic, linear and periodic piecewise distributions, are
systematically investigated. The outcomes show that the ligand distribution of the nanoparticle is
an important factor of the cellular uptake process, and that the uniform ligand distribution of the
nanoparticle is the optimal distribution with the highest efficacy of cellular uptake. The method is

traditional, while the results are sound and reasonable. I would like to recommend the
publication of this paper after the authors addressing the following issues:
1. In the three ligand distribution patterns, what happens if the initial contact point between the
nanoparticle and the membrane changes?
2. What the insets in Figures 4, 6 and 7 stand for?
3. The authors should discuss the limitations of the model. For example, the nanoparticles are
cylindrical and the surface tension of the membrane is not considered.
4. The main novelty of the manuscript is that the ligand distribution is non-uniform. Although
there is no published work on the influence of the ligand distribution on the cellular uptake
process (as far as I know), there are similar theoretical works on the cell membrane spreading on
substrates coated with non-uniform ligands (e.g., Alireza S. Sarvestani and Esmaiel Jabbari, 2008,
Journal of Biomechanics 41, 921–925), the equations of which are almost the same with the
present manuscript. I suggest the authors to cite the related papers.
5. The references 33 and 34 are incorrect. In ref. 33, “Xin, Y” should be “Yi, X.” and the authors of
the ref. 34 are wrong.

Manuscript Title: Ligand-distribution-dependent efficiency of cellular uptake of
nanoparticles
Authors: Long Li, Yudie Zhang and Jizeng Wang
We would like to thank the Associate Editor and reviewers for their thoughtful comments.
The paper has been revised accordingly. Below is an itemized response to each specific
comment.
Associate Editor’s comments:
Comments to the Author:
Comments: It is imperative that whatever has remained “unclear” after the initial
publication of the effect is clearly delineated and discussed. Otherwise this MS is simply a
confirmative report.
Response: Thanks for the comments. We have added more results and descriptions to
delineate and discuss the difference of our study with previous results in the revised
manuscript. On the effect of ligand distribution to nanoparticle uptake, we have mainly
discussed the difference of our work with reference [R1] (corresponding to reference 42 in the
revised manuscript) by Schubertová et al.. We have emphasized in the revised manuscript the
differences as follows:
(1) The model problems are different: In our study, we have considered the wrapping
of nanoparticle by membrane with diffusible receptors of arbitrary density; In [R1]
(corresponding to reference 42 in the revised manuscript), they assumed that the receptor
density is extremely high so that diffusion can be hindered. However, in most cases, receptor
diffusion plays an important role in NP uptake into normal cells. For the
receptor-diffusion-mediated uptake of NPs, it remains unclear how the distribution of ligands
and the diffusion of mobile receptors may couple together to influence the cellular uptake of
NPs. Although Schubertová et al. [R1] (corresponding to reference 42 in the revised
manuscript) have taken account the effect of ligand diffusion. However, when both the
density of ligands and receptors are high, diffusion of either ligands or receptors becomes not
important. For other cases, effect of ligand diffusion to the NP uptake is quite different from
that of receptor diffusion. For example, in the case of very low receptor density, the NP still
can be completely wrapped in as long as the density of ligands is sufficiently large, receptor
diffusion makes this to happen and influences the total wrapping time. On the other hand, in
the case of very low ligand density, no matter the density of receptor to be low or high,
diffusion of ligands cannot make the NP to be wrapped in.
(2) The results are different: in our manuscript, our conclusions on the case of low
receptor density cannot be exactly predicted by the model in [R1] (corresponding to reference
42 in the revised manuscript), for example, we have found that the most efficient wrapping
case corresponds to a slightly wavy form distribution of ligands depending on receptor density.
Only when receptor density is high enough, then the optimized distribution of ligands can be
“exactly” uniform, which then becomes similar to the high density case as studied by [R1]
(corresponding to reference 42 in the revised manuscript); In addition to the optimal state, our
manuscript also studied how wavy form distribution quantitatively influences the wrapping
time of nanoparticles.
(3) The methods are different: We have adopted a continuum statistical mechanics
model to taking account the effect of receptor diffusion, receptor density and membrane
bending etc.. In our model, wrapping process can take arbitrary long time, and is controlled
by receptor diffusion; Reference [R1] (corresponding to reference 42 in the revised
manuscript) adopted a coarse-grained atomic dynamics model, which has many great
advantages. However, generally speaking, atomic dynamics simulations is usually difficult to
simulate very long time wrapping process, which corresponds to the low density of diffusible
receptors. In addition, effect of ligand diffusion is different from that of receptor diffusion
when average density of receptors is low as discussed above.
Reviewers’ Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s):
The manuscript describes the results of the computer simulations of nanoparticle uptake
across phospholipid membrane. The authors used continuum description together with an
elastic theory to evaluate the changes of membrane wrapping time caused by different ligand
distribution on the nanoparticle surface. The wrapping is found to be the fastest in the case of
homogeneous distribution. This is a useful and important finding.
We thank the reviewer for his positive assessment of the paper.
Comments: The main issue of this manuscript is that the effect has investigated and
published before-ref 42. The authors mention previous work in the introduction but after that,
they state that the effect of ligand distribution remains unclear, yet ending with the same
finding as ref 42. Therefore, the authors should:
1 – clarify in the introduction what remains unclear (page 4 line 42) and clearly state what
was found in ref 42.
Response: Thanks for the comment and suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have
clarified in the introduction what remains unclear and clearly stated what was found in
reference [R1] (corresponding to reference 42 in the revised manuscript). In the “Introduction”
section, we have added the following paragraph: “Recently, Schubertová et al. [R1]
(corresponding to reference 42 in the revised manuscript) performed extensive coarse-grained
molecular dynamics simulations to explore the effects of ligand distribution on
cellular-uptake rate of NPs, where receptor diffusion is prohibited by setting extremely high
density, and ligands on the NPs are either diffusible or immobile. By considering various
cases of different ligand distributions, they found that the NP with homogeneous ligand
distribution can be most efficiently wrapped by the cell membrane, as inhomogeneous
distribution of ligands may increase activation energy and reduce the uptake efficiency.
Although the finding is interesting, in most cases, receptor diffusion plays an important role in
NP uptake into normal cells [R2-R8]. For the receptor-diffusion-mediated uptake of NPs, it
remains unclear how the distribution of ligands and the diffusion of mobile receptors with low
average density may couple together to influence the cellular uptake of NPs.”
Comments: 2 – properly discuss their findings with respect to previous work, mainly the
reference 42
Response: Thanks. In the revised manuscript, we have added the following discussion in the
“Results and Discussions” section: “Interestingly, in the extreme case that receptor are
“immobile” due to large density, a “similar” conclusion on that uniform ligand distribution is
most favourable on NP uptake has been revealed by Schubertová et al. [R1] (corresponding to
reference 42 in the revised manuscript) through performing coarse-grained molecular
dynamics simulations. In the present study, once we increase the average receptor density
from 0.01 <U+F078>L0 to 0.1 <U+F078>L0 , we can observe from Fig. R1 (corresponding to Fig. 4 in the revised
manuscript) that uniform distribution becomes the most efficient case for NP uptake, which
becomes very similar to the case of “immobile” receptors as studied by Schubertová et al. [R1]
(corresponding to reference 42 in the revised manuscript). In contrast, when average receptor
density is low, the optimal distribution of ligands is no longer uniform, instead, it becomes a
slightly wavy form with amplitude not too far from zero. Although Schubertová et al. [R1]
(corresponding to reference 42 in the revised manuscript) did not consider the effect of
receptor diffusion at low density, they found that taking account effect of ligand diffusion will
not change the fact that uniform distribution of ligands corresponds to the fastest uptake. We
should note that effect of ligand diffusion to the NP uptake is quite different from that of
receptor diffusion. For example, in the case of very low receptor density, the NP still can be
completely wrapped in as long as the density of ligands is sufficiently large, receptor diffusion
makes this to happen and influences the total wrapping time. On the other hand, in the case of
very low ligand density, no matter the density of receptor to be low or high, diffusion of
ligands cannot make the NP to be wrapped in. When both the density of ligands and receptors
are high, diffusion of either ligands or receptors becomes not important at all [R1]
(corresponding to reference 42 in the revised manuscript).
We may wonder why it is slightly non-uniform not exact uniform distribution of ligands
corresponds to the most efficient wrapping when density of receptors is low. The mechanism
behind is that NP uptake under situation of low receptor density usually needs long time
diffusion to recruit enough receptors to the binding site. During this period, the optimized
local balance between adhesion energy as driving force and the configurational entropy
change of diffusible receptors as well as membrane bending as the resistance may change
over time, resulting in spatial distribution pattern of ligands.”

Comments: 3 – clearly state what is the novelty of this manuscript, e.g. confirmation of
previous findings by completely different method
Response: Thanks for this comment. We have further considered and interpreted our findings
by adding more quantitative predictions. After comparing with the interesting work in [R1]
(corresponding to reference 42 in the revised manuscript), we have achieved the following
recognitions to justify the novelty of our study: By using completely different method, we
have confirmed and further extended previous findings on how the ligand distribution may
influence nanoparticle uptake.
(1) From the aspect of model problem: In our study, we have considered the wrapping
of nanoparticle by membrane with diffusible receptors of arbitrary density; In [R1]
(corresponding to reference 42 in the revised manuscript), they assumed that the receptor
density is extremely high so that diffusion can be hindered. However, in most cases, receptor
diffusion plays an important role in NP uptake into normal cells. For the
receptor-diffusion-mediated uptake of NPs, it remains unclear how the distribution of ligands
and the diffusion of mobile receptors may couple together to influence the cellular uptake of
NPs. Although Schubertová et al. [R1] (corresponding to reference 42 in the revised
manuscript) have taken account the effect of ligand diffusion. However, when both the
density of ligands and receptors are high, diffusion of either ligands or receptors becomes not
important. For other cases, effect of ligand diffusion to the NP uptake is quite different from
that of receptor diffusion. For example, in the case of very low receptor density, the NP still
can be completely wrapped in as long as the density of ligands is sufficiently large, receptor
diffusion makes this to happen and influences the total wrapping time. On the other hand, in
the case of very low ligand density, no matter the density of receptor to be low or high,
diffusion of ligands cannot make the NP to be wrapped in.
(2) From the aspect of findings: In our manuscript, our conclusions on the case of low
receptor density cannot be exactly predicted by the model in [R1] (corresponding to reference
42 in the revised manuscript), for example, we have found that the most efficient wrapping
case corresponds to a slightly wavy form distribution of ligands depending on receptor density.
Only when receptor density is high enough, then the optimized distribution of ligands can be
“exactly” uniform, which then becomes similar to the high density case as studied by [R1]
(corresponding to reference 42 in the revised manuscript); In addition to the optimal state, our
manuscript also studied how wavy form distribution quantitatively influences the wrapping
time of nanoparticles.
(3) From the aspect of methodology: We have adopted a continuum statistical
mechanics model to taking account the effect of receptor diffusion, receptor density and
membrane bending etc.. In our model, wrapping process can take arbitrary long time, and is
controlled by receptor diffusion; Reference [R1] (corresponding to reference 42 in the revised
manuscript) adopted a coarse-grained atomic dynamics model, which has many great
advantages. However, generally speaking, atomic dynamics simulations is usually difficult to
simulate very long time wrapping process, which corresponds to the low density of diffusible
receptors. In addition, effect of ligand diffusion is different from that of receptor diffusion
when average density of receptors is low as discussed above.

Comments to the Author(s):
In the manuscript, the authors reported a statistical dynamics model of receptor-mediated
endocytosis to examine the influences of the distributions of ligands on the cellular uptake
process. Three cases, i.e., the harmonic, linear and periodic piecewise distributions, are
systematically investigated. The outcomes show that the ligand distribution of the
nanoparticle is an important factor of the cellular uptake process, and that the uniform ligand
distribution of the nanoparticle is the optimal distribution with the highest efficacy of cellular
uptake. The method is traditional, while the results are sound and reasonable. I would like to
recommend the publication of this paper after the author addressing the following issues:
We thank the reviewer for his positive assessment of the paper.
Comments: 1. In the three ligand distribution patterns, what happens if the initial contact
point between the nanoparticle and the membrane changes?
Response: Thanks for the constructive comments. After careful investigation, we found that
positions of initial contact points may significantly influence the wrapping process of NPs. In
the revised manuscript, we have added Figs. R2-R4 (corresponding to Figs. 10-12 in the
revised manuscript) and the following paragraphs to discuss this issue:
“We have determined the influence of ligand distribution characterized by wavy
amplitude and frequency on the cellular uptake of NPs. However, as the wrapping process is
highly nonlinear, therefore we hypothesize that even slight difference in the initial contact
position of a NP with fixed ligand distribution may lead to a notable change in the total
wrapping time. In order to justify this hypothesis, we consider the uptake of NPs with
different initial contact positions, for the cases of harmonic, periodic linear and periodic
piecewise distributions, respectively. The wrapping time is numerically determined and
plotted in Figs. R2-R4 (corresponding to Figs. 10-12 in the revised manuscript) as a function
of the normalized position of the contact point under different amplitude and frequency of
ligand distributions. We can obviously observe that the dynamic process of cellular uptake
can be significantly influenced by the position change of the initial contact point when the
distribution amplitude is large or distribution frequency is low. In contrast, when the wavy
amplitude is low or wavy frequency is large, the influence of positions of contact point on the
uptake process becomes small.
Figs. R2c, R3c and R4c (corresponding to Figs. 10c, 11c and 12c in the revised
manuscript) show the normalized initial boundary density of receptors as a function of the
normalized position of initial contact point for the cases of harmonic, periodic linear and
periodic piecewise distributions of ligands, respectively. It can be seen from Figs. R2-R4
(corresponding to Figs. 10-12 in the revised manuscript) that the fastest wrapping is
associated with the contact position of highest ligand density. Further, the highest ligand
density at the initial contact position corresponds to the largest gradient of initial receptor
distribution, furthermore the largest initial receptor diffusion flux and the fastest initial
wrapping speed. Hence, the contact point position – dependent wrapping process may be
interpreted as initial wrapping speed dependent. A similar mechanism has been revealed in
our previous study [18] on cellular uptake of cylindrical NPs with different orientations.”

Comments: 2. What the insets in Figures 4, 6 and 7 stands for?
Response: The insets in Figures 4, 6 and 7 are their zoomed in around the origin of the
coordinates. In the revised manuscript, we have replaced Fig. 4, 6 and 7 by new figures with
carefully selected coordinate ranges.
Comments: 3. The authors should discuss the limitations of the model. For example, the
nanoparticles are cylindrical and surface of the membrane is not considered.
Response: Thanks, we have added the following paragraph to discuss the limitation of the
model:
“There are several limitations in this study, including that the NPs are cylindrical and
surface tension of the membrane is not considered, and kinetic reaction between receptor and
ligand molecules [R9-R13] and viscoelastic deformation of cytoskeleton [R14, R15] are
neglected.”
Comments: 4. The main novelty of the manuscript is that the ligand distribution is
non-uniform. Although there is no published work on the influence of the ligand distribution
on the cellular uptake process (as far as I know), there are similar theoretical works on the
cell membrane spreading on substrates coated with non-uniform ligands (e.g., Alireza S.
Sarvestani and Esmaiel Jabbari, 2008, Journal of Biomechanics 41, 921-925), the equations
of which are almost the same with the present manuscript. I suggest the authors to cite the
related papers.
Response: Thanks to point out this. In the revised manuscript, we have cited the related
papers and added the following sentenses: “We note that a similar mathematical framework
has been developed in previous studies of biological membranes spreading on a substrate
coated with uniform [R16] (corresponding to the reference [44] in the revised manuscript) and
non-uniform ligands [R17] (corresponding to the reference [45] in the revised manuscript),
respectively.”
Comments: 5. The references 33 and 34 are incorrent. In ref. 33, “Xin, Y” should be “Yi, X.”
and the authors of the ref. 34 are wrong.
Response: Thanks, corrected.
