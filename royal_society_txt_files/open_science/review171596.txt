The submitted manuscript concerns the synthesis novel a series of 2-O-alkyl-substituted
adenosine analogues with indole moiety as human A3 adenosine receptor (AR) ligands. The
molecular modeling studies have also been performed to investigate the binding mode of the
potential compound in the ligand-binding pocket of human A3 receptor.
The authors described that results demonstrated that one of the analogues can interact with the
ASN250, GLN167, PHE168 and VAL178 through hydrogen bonding, which are shown to be
important for ligand-receptor interaction. The results are of interest to medicinal chemistry.

Structure of the compound was sufficiently well analyzed and confirmed. The synthesized
compounds have been well characterized. Specification of biological tests is properly done and
results obtained are well discussed.
The paper is generally well written, although there will be a need for a significant amount of
editing before publication:
1. N, via – must be written in italics, this mistake is repeated in the text;
2. Why are these substituents selected (R=Me, Bn)?
3. In the Scheme 1, there are missing reaction stages and a reference to literature;
4. In the Schemes 2, 3 and 4 also numbered substrates;
5. 4-bromo-1-indolecarbaldehyde (Scheme 4) – Is that the correct name of the compound?
Is it commercially available?
6. Did the ylide used in the reaction Wittig (Scheme 4) have been obtained, if so how?
In References the authors should post the following publication:

where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,

The reviewer has stated that the corrections incorporated are satisfactory and the manuscript can
be accepted as is.
Appendix A
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
1. Page 1, line 49. line should be as "It is also a neuromodulator..."
Answer: “It is also aneuromodulator….” has been changed into "It is also a neuromodulator..." as red color.
2. Page 2, line 17, Therefore, small molecule modulators.....anticancer, and cardioprotective agents. needs a
reference.
Answer: The references [19-21] have been added after this sentence as red color.
3. The experiment section of synthetic part should also be given with proper supporting data inducing yield of
reactions.
Answer: The synthetic parts in supporting information have proper characteristic data and procedures including
yield of reactions.
4. Page 3, line 24, it should be 5' bromo analogue.
Answer: “5’ bromo analogs” has been changed into 5' bromo analogue as red color.
6. Page 3, line 53 to 55, "dock into the binding pocket of the protein of interest" this line needs ref. or detail
about docking experiment may be included.
Answer: The detailed procedures of docking experiment are in supporting information.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
1. N, via – must be written in italics, this mistake is repeated in the text;
Answer: In the manuscript, all the N were written in italics as red color.
2. Why are these substituents selected (R=Me, Bn)?
Answer: We want to know whether small or big substituents can effect affinity of A3AR? Later perhaps can
synthesize more effective compounds based on this structure.
3. In the Scheme 1, there are missing reaction stages and a reference to literature;
Answer: In supporting information Scheme 1, the ref. 1 has been added as red color.
4. In the Schemes 2, 3 and 4 also numbered substrates;
Answer: In the Schemes 2, 3 and 4, there starting materials have been numbered.
5. 4-bromo-1-indolecarbaldehyde (Scheme 4) – Is that the correct name of the compound?
Is it commercially available?
Answer: The 4-bromo-1-indolecarbaldehyde is wrong name and should be 4-bromoindole-3-carboxaldehyde as
commercially available.
6. Did the ylide used in the reaction Wittig (Scheme 4) have been obtained, if so how?
Answer: The ylide used in the reaction Wittig is commercially available.
For recommed references I have added in this manuscript as references [19-21] in red color.
