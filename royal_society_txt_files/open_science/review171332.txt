This manuscript documents two scientifically sound and original research results of wide interest
across scientific disciplines, that 1) there is significant heterogeneity in the antimicrobial activity
of a diverse range of ant species, and that 2) the microbial activity does not appear to scale with
colony size. Both of these results are striking in that they are completely unexpected based on
existing theory.
Some additional comments:
Introduction, line 107: “We correct our models for worker body size and phylogenetic factors.”
Perhaps it is more accurate to say that these factors were taken into account than to say that the
models were corrected.
Methods, line 115: Instead of “Myrmycinae” I believe you mean “Myrmicinae”
Methods, line 116: Was a colony of 220,000 individuals actually counted to determine its size, or
were these size metrics taken from someplace such as Wilson and Hölldobler’s table?
Methods, line 117: What is meant by “independent”?
Methods, line 118: Perhaps clarify that this done with groups of 5, 10, 20, and 40 workers to test
varying levels of potential antimicrobial concentration.
Discussion, lines 201-213: In this discussion of the effects of colony (and body) size, some
attention could be focused on the (currently neglected) effects of allometry. Larger individuals
(and larger colonies) typically exhibit lower mass-specific metabolic rates. Would this pattern not
then suggest that larger individuals and larger colonies would invest less energy per-capita or
per-surface-area on antimicrobial defenses, just as is found for metabolism, growth rate, etc?
Large colony size also confers many other potential immune functions associated with spatial
heterogeneity, division of labor, and perhaps task specialization for antimicrobial policing.
Discussion, line 238: there is a period instead of a comma following the word example.
Discussion, line 268-69: Frankly, I’m not fully convinced about this colony size effect (or lack
thereof) since there are many uncontrolled variables including the size of the actual colonies these
workers were sampled from (assuming species-typical estimates were used), developmental
stage of the colonies, and age or behavioral caste of the actual workers which were tested.
Obviously, the authors’ statistical analysis is solid and their reporting of a negative result is
admirable and nothing should get in the way of this being published (especially sins RSOS has
publishing negative results as an explicit objective of the journal)… but some transparency with
regard to the potential shortcomings of this design and some attention to future colony-size
related research would be useful.
Figure 1: While this is an otherwise beautiful figure, the depiction of shaded circles for colony
3
size is not very useful. Perhaps the relevant metric could be log-transformed (and obviously
explained as such in the legend)?
Figure 1: Could the concentration columns proceed from smallest to greatest in a left-to-right
direction?
Figure S1-S3: These figures are excellent and should be included in the main manuscript, not
reserved for the supplement, especially Figure S1.

The authors have attempted to extract antimicrobials from the surface of ant bodies from various
species by soaking them in ethanol. Afterwards, they have used these extracts in exposure
experiments with Staphylococcus epidermis to determine their antimicrobial properties. The
hypothesis was that there would be a positive correlation between ant species and their
respective colony sizes and antimicrobial activity. The authors, however, have not been able to
demonstrate this.
This manuscript has been well written and I think the idea of mining ant-antimicrobials for new
antibiotics is an interesting one. I, furthermore, want to positively recognize the fact that this
study was done as part of an undergraduate course. This study has clearly been a great
undergraduate research experience. However, I do not think the manuscript is of the standard
needed to be published in this journal, in its current form.
I do not think that the conclusions being drawn from this study are supported by the data. In
addition, the introduction and the discussion could have benefitted from added information
regarding the pathogenic side of ant -microbe interactions and the actual compounds that might
be found in the ant extracts.
4
The authors mention that ants secrete antimicrobials multiple times but fail to mention what
those compounds would actually be. Is this information known? The introduction and Discussion
would benefit from this information. Additionally, both sections would benefit from more
background information on the various entomopathogenic microbes that ants are exposed to.
What could this mean for the bioactive compounds that ants might produce to protect
themselves? This reviewer understands that this study is more host-centered but the claims being
made are currently too vague and general, which leads to a Discussion that is not necessarily
sparking follow-up studies into this topic.
Line 55: ”secretion of antimicrobial compounds akin to our antibiotics.” What are these
compounds? Akin to which antibiotics?
Line 64-68: How were these mentioned studies done? The same material and methods as used
here? What microbes were these hymenopterans tested against?
Line 82: “are known to secrete antibiotic compounds…” Antibiotic against what? Or what
compounds were found and what is their bioactivity?
Line 86: “produce antimicrobial compounds via other glands” Do these compounds have the
same or different properties? Are these considered more or less advanced?
The microbe used in this study is Staphylococcus epidermis. While reading, I wondered about the
relevance of using this microbe with respect to ant communities and it only became clear in the
Discussion that this microbe is not even a pathogen. The authors validate the use of this organism
by stating that others used it in their studies (Lines 93-96). I, however, do not think this is enough.
The authors should have at least performed an experiment in which they challenge ants with this
microbe to see if their study would have any biological relevance. Especially, since the
antimicrobials produced by ants could have evolved to be very specifically working against true
pathogens only. The authors also correctly discuss this themselves in Lines 230-234. An
experiment to see if interaction with this species would elicit any reaction in the host at all would
be the minimum needed. It would, however, still have been better to use a true entomopathogen
(or even better, multiple entomopathogens) instead, because of the reason mentioned above. Co-
evolution between pathogens and hosts can lead to very species-specific strategies.
I could not find any information about how the ants for this study were collected. Were
individuals collected in the field and immediately placed in ethanol? Or were entire colonies
collected, and individuals taken from those colonies? I think this information could be relevant
with respect to antimicrobial compound production and thus the results. If ants were kept in the
lab for some time, where they are not challenged by pathogens etc., they might not necessarily
produce antimicrobials? Especially, if these compounds are costly to make. If individual ants
were collected, then the authors had no idea about the actual size of the colonies they were
collected from. Sure, we know from literature how large certain species’ colonies can get over
time, but ants might therefore produce less antimicrobials when the colony is still at a smaller
size. Including collection information could thus lead to an interesting discussion and questions
that could be tested in a follow up study.
Some more background information about the extract preparation techniques would also be
needed. Ethanol was used, but are all antimicrobials soluble in ethanol? Will they all be washed
off the ant using ethanol? Does ethanol change anything about the bioactive properties of the
compounds of interest? What about the evaporation process? It could be, for instance, that the
antimicrobials produced by Solenopsis species are different from those produced by some other
ants, and are more stable under the extraction conditions. Some more information is thus needed
here to interpret the results correctly.
5
Regarding the OD readings, it would be informative to know more about the growth curve of S.
epidermis. How does this organism grow over time under these conditions? What is the average
OD of the positive control after 24h? Is this at the stationary phase of the growth curve or still
within the exponential phase? This would inform the reader if 24h incubation under these
conditions is indeed sufficient.
To reiterate, the claims made in e.g. Lines 196-200 and 201-203 cannot be deduced from the
results in this study. As detailed above, there are too many unknown variables that could have
contributed here. One of the reasons for the results to be inconclusive being the use of a microbial
organism that is not necessarily biologically relevant with respect to ant-antimicrobial responses.

Associate Editor's comments:
This manuscript had divergent opinions from the reviewers, with one enthusiastic, and the other
skeptical that the results are truly meaningful for addressing the question at hand. The authors
have cogently defined an interesting problem regarding the antimicrobial secretions of ants (and
the potential lack thereof), but it is unclear if the conclusions are warranted. In the revision, I
recommend paying close attention to reviewer 2's comments, which will need to be satisfied in
order for the manuscript to move forward.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
Since my first review of this manuscript, the authors have revised it to address points raised by
myself and another reviewer.
Author responses to my review (#18-29) are satisfactory and I appreciate the changes that have
been made to address these points. The increased clarification with respect to colony size and
field sampling technique are especially useful. The only issue I would care to repeat is to urge the
authors and editor to include some of the supplemental figures in the main manuscript text,
space permitting.
I don’t believe it is good form to raise new issues in a follow-up review that weren’t mentioned in
the first pass, but an idea occurred to me while reading the revised manuscript and it may be
worth mentioning. The idea is that not all bacteria are bad. As the authors mention (l. 271-273),
11
the cultivation of beneficial microbes may be a key factor in why some ant taxa produce broad
spectrum antibiotics or not. Since the authors mention this possibility, it isn’t necessary to change
anything, but it might be worth more than passing mention in a sentence. Work on ant colony
bacterial mutualistic symbionts by Corrie Moreau and others could be cited and connecting to
that literature will definitely improve the impact of this manuscript.
Russell, J. A, Sanders, J. G. & Moreau, C. S. (2017). Hotspots for symbiosis: Function, evolution,
and specificity of ant-microbe associations from trunk to tips of the ant phylogeny (Hymenoptera:
Formicidae). Myrmecological News 24: 43-69.
With specific reference to concerns raised by the second reviewer, I find the authors’ responses
considerate and convincing. I address a few key comments from the second reviewer below:
(1) “The hypothesis that there would be a positive correlation between ant species and their
respective colony sizes and antimicrobial activity. The authors, however, have not been able to
demonstrate this… the claims made in lines 196-200 and 201-203 cannot be deduced from the
results in this study.” These remarks by the reviewer are simply incorrect. The authors used a
standard assay for general antimicrobial secretions and reported results that were contrary to the
general expectations from social insect literature. That the reviewer might’ve wished the study
was conducted differently does not change the fact that the authors have faithfully reported the
methods and results of an important study.
(2) The second reviewer thought it necessary to comment on some authors’ status as
undergraduate students. Is this appropriate? The reviewer brings it up in a positive way, but
nestled within a series of negative remarks as if the undergraduate students’ status should
somehow affect the fit of this manuscript for the journal. This is completely ridiculous - it is not
the point of peer review for reviewers to speculate on the trustworthiness of authors based on
their age or status. There is no shortage of individuals with a Ph.D. on the list of authors. The
methods and data speak for themselves and are perfectly suited for publication in this journal.
(3) The second reviewer repeatedly questions the authors’ selection of Staphylococcus epidermis.
As the authors state this selection was made because it is standard assay in the field and a
necessary method to enable addressing the broad comparative questions this study was designed
for. This study was conceived to directly follow-up on a series of papers in the literature that
speculated about colony size and social immunity without a data set to test these ideas. The
current authors have provided exactly such a data set and it has revealed some striking areas for
follow-up. The pathogenicity of S. epidermis for various ant species isn’t relevant since the focus
is on broad comparisons of antimicrobial secretions. To identify specific pathogens for each ant
species and specific antipathogenic compounds for each is work that could take more than a
lifetime. Following up with studies of particular species and their specific microbial interactions
is likely once this paper is published since it reveals some taxa as particularly interesting.

I was not a reviewer on the initial draft of this manuscript, but have carefully reviewed the
previous reviewer comments and how the authors have addressed those in the current draft.
I find that the authors have done a good job addressing the reviewer comments.
I also applaud the authors for 1) working to publish research done with undergraduates, and 2)
working to publish negative results.
The difficulty with this manuscript is precisely what I applaud above, that the results are
13
negative. Negative results are so difficult to interpret, but there is inherent value in putting them
out for criticism and critique - to move dialogue forward. To this end, the most important
concerns for me are 1) whether the experimental methods are sound, 2) whether the methods and
results (warts and all) are clear, and 3) whether the interpretation is honest and not overblown.
I think that all of these concerns are addressed in this manuscript. While I agree with the
previous reviewer that I have plenty of doubts in my mind as to what inhibition of a non-
pathogenic bacteria really means, the reasons for using this bacteria are well stated (as are the
limitations). And of course, there are many additional pieces to this story the authors could work
on, but I don't think these are pre-requisites for this manuscript (for example, whether there is a
trade-off between anti-microbial production and the culturing of a microbiome).
So, I think the manuscript achieves its purpose, to put the data out there for people to draw their
own conclusions - the data stimulate new hypotheses, but do not close doors on old ones.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
The comments of the reviewers have been addressed satisfactorily (although a few suggestions
remain). In addition, a third referee was invited to the review, and they had a positive view of the
manuscript. Overall, this manuscript addresses a deficiency in the social scaling literature, and
will be a nice addition to the field.

Prior to final acceptance, please consider the thoughtful comments of reviewer 1, who has
additional suggestions. Also, please consider moving figure S1 to the main text.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have addressed all my concerns appropriately
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Since my first review of this manuscript, the authors have revised it to address points raised by
myself and another reviewer.
Author responses to my review (#18-29) are satisfactory and I appreciate the changes that have
been made to address these points. The increased clarification with respect to colony size and
field sampling technique are especially useful. The only issue I would care to repeat is to urge the
authors and editor to include some of the supplemental figures in the main manuscript text,
space permitting.
I don’t believe it is good form to raise new issues in a follow-up review that weren’t mentioned in
the first pass, but an idea occurred to me while reading the revised manuscript and it may be
worth mentioning. The idea is that not all bacteria are bad. As the authors mention (l. 271-273),
the cultivation of beneficial microbes may be a key factor in why some ant taxa produce broad
spectrum antibiotics or not. Since the authors mention this possibility, it isn’t necessary to change
anything, but it might be worth more than passing mention in a sentence. Work on ant colony
bacterial mutualistic symbionts by Corrie Moreau and others could be cited and connecting to
that literature will definitely improve the impact of this manuscript.
Russell, J. A, Sanders, J. G. & Moreau, C. S. (2017). Hotspots for symbiosis: Function, evolution,
and specificity of ant-microbe associations from trunk to tips of the ant phylogeny (Hymenoptera:
Formicidae). Myrmecological News 24: 43-69.
With specific reference to concerns raised by the second reviewer, I find the authors’ responses
considerate and convincing. I address a few key comments from the second reviewer below:
(1) “The hypothesis that there would be a positive correlation between ant species and their
respective colony sizes and antimicrobial activity. The authors, however, have not been able to
demonstrate this… the claims made in lines 196-200 and 201-203 cannot be deduced from the
results in this study.” These remarks by the reviewer are simply incorrect. The authors used a
standard assay for general antimicrobial secretions and reported results that were contrary to the
general expectations from social insect literature. That the reviewer might’ve wished the study
was conducted differently does not change the fact that the authors have faithfully reported the
methods and results of an important study.
(2) The second reviewer thought it necessary to comment on some authors’ status as
undergraduate students. Is this appropriate? The reviewer brings it up in a positive way, but
nestled within a series of negative remarks as if the undergraduate students’ status should
17
somehow affect the fit of this manuscript for the journal. This is completely ridiculous - it is not
the point of peer review for reviewers to speculate on the trustworthiness of authors based on
their age or status. There is no shortage of individuals with a Ph.D. on the list of authors. The
methods and data speak for themselves and are perfectly suited for publication in this journal.
(3) The second reviewer repeatedly questions the authors’ selection of Staphylococcus epidermis.
As the authors state this selection was made because it is standard assay in the field and a
necessary method to enable addressing the broad comparative questions this study was designed
for. This study was conceived to directly follow-up on a series of papers in the literature that
speculated about colony size and social immunity without a data set to test these ideas. The
current authors have provided exactly such a data set and it has revealed some striking areas for
follow-up. The pathogenicity of S. epidermis for various ant species isn’t relevant since the focus
is on broad comparisons of antimicrobial secretions. To identify specific pathogens for each ant
species and specific antipathogenic compounds for each is work that could take more than a
lifetime. Following up with studies of particular species and their specific microbial interactions
is likely once this paper is published since it reveals some taxa as particularly interesting.
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
I was not a reviewer on the initial draft of this manuscript, but have carefully reviewed the
previous reviewer comments and how the authors have addressed those in the current draft.
I find that the authors have done a good job addressing the reviewer comments.
I also applaud the authors for 1) working to publish research done with undergraduates, and 2)
working to publish negative results.
The difficulty with this manuscript is precisely what I applaud above, that the results are
negative. Negative results are so difficult to interpret, but there is inherent value in putting them
out for criticism and critique - to move dialogue forward. To this end, the most important
concerns for me are 1) whether the experimental methods are sound, 2) whether the methods and
results (warts and all) are clear, and 3) whether the interpretation is honest and not overblown.
I think that all of these concerns are addressed in this manuscript. While I agree with the
previous reviewer that I have plenty of doubts in my mind as to what inhibition of a non-
pathogenic bacteria really means, the reasons for using this bacteria are well stated (as are the
limitations). And of course, there are many additional pieces to this story the authors could work
on, but I don't think these are pre-requisites for this manuscript (for example, whether there is a
trade-off between anti-microbial production and the culturing of a microbiome).
So, I think the manuscript achieves its purpose, to put the data out there for people to draw their
own conclusions - the data stimulate new hypotheses, but do not close doors on old ones.

Appendix A
Associate Editor's comments:
This manuscript had divergent opinions from the reviewers, with one enthusiastic, and the other
skeptical that the results are truly meaningful for addressing the question at hand. The authors have
cogently defined an interesting problem regarding the antimicrobial secretions of ants (and the potential
lack thereof), but it is unclear if the conclusions are warranted. In the revision, I recommend paying
close attention to reviewer 2's comments, which will need to be satisfied in order for the manuscript to
move forward.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE: We thank the editor for the chance to respond to the reviews and thank both
reviewers for their helpful comments. We paid special attention to the concerns that reviewer 2
expressed and felt that those concerns were helpful in seeing how the former state of the manuscript
might be interpreted. Their concerns have helped us revise the manuscript to include more specific
details that strengthen our manuscript and help make the intentions of this study clearer. We believe
that we have satisfied all of reviewers’ 1 & 2 concerns and believe that doing so helped improve this
manuscript. We have detailed all our changes below and included specific responses for every expressed
concern. We start with those from reviewer 2.

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have attempted to extract antimicrobials from the surface of ant bodies from various
species by soaking them in ethanol. Afterwards, they have used these extracts in exposure experiments
with Staphylococcus epidermis to determine their antimicrobial properties. The hypothesis was that
there would be a positive correlation between ant species and their respective colony sizes and
antimicrobial activity. The authors, however, have not been able to demonstrate this.
This manuscript has been well written and I think the idea of mining ant-antimicrobials for new
antibiotics is an interesting one. I, furthermore, want to positively recognize the fact that this study was
done as part of an undergraduate course. This study has clearly been a great undergraduate research
experience.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 1: Thank you
However, I do not think the manuscript is of the standard needed to be published in this journal, in its
current form.
I do not think that the conclusions being drawn from this study are supported by the data. In addition,
the introduction and the discussion could have benefitted from added information regarding the
pathogenic side of ant -microbe interactions and the actual compounds that might be found in the ant
extracts.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 2: We believe that our conclusions are warranted based on our results, and we
have addressed the reviewer’s points in detail below.
The authors mention that ants secrete antimicrobials multiple times but fail to mention what those
compounds would actually be. Is this information known? The introduction and Discussion would benefit
from this information.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 3: We have summarized what is known about the antimicrobials that ants excrete
and how it is relevant to our study by adding the following sentences to the third paragraph of the
discussion: “The few studies that have investigated major components of metapleural gland secretions
identified phenols, carboxylic acids, and fatty acids [21]. In this study, the source of the antimicrobial
compounds in the raw extracts we tested are not known, but our use of a polar solvent would have
extracted these known classes of active metapleural gland components.” Some information directly
speaking to this issue was already in the discussion, for example, discussion of formic acid and venom
compounds. We have now added specific reference to the classes of known venom antimicrobials: “ Ant
venoms, which can contain peptides and alkaloids, may be used as antimicrobials in those species that
have a stinger [24, 38], though not all”.
Additionally, both sections would benefit from more background information on the various
entomopathogenic microbes that ants are exposed to. What could this mean for the bioactive
compounds that ants might produce to protect themselves?
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 4: The fourth paragraph of our discussion does provide information of how
entomopathogen exposure influences antimicrobial usage. Because specific knowledge of both bacterial
entomopathogens and bioactive antimicrobial compounds is extremely limited, we are not able to make
these types of predictions. What we do know from some studies is that known sources of ant
antimicrobials inhibit a broad range of microbes (bacteria, fungi, and yeasts). There are more examples
of broad range efficacy than specific. This may be because specificity in both pathogens and active
antimicrobial compounds is not well investigated. We have added the following sentence to the 4th
paragraph of the discussion to reflect this: “Most known entomopathogens are fungal rather than
bacterial; however, most tests of antimicrobial secretions in ants have found broad- spectrum effects,
including the inhibition of bacteria, fungi, and yeasts [7, 21].”
This reviewer understands that this study is more host-centered but the claims being made are currently
too vague and general, which leads to a Discussion that is not necessarily sparking follow-up studies into
this topic.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 5: The focus of our manuscript is to directly follow up past studies that have
driven current theory about the evolution of sociality and disease-defense strategies (see paragraphs 1-
3 of the introduction). We do so by providing the largest comparative data set for a social insect group,
and we use the same methodologies as these previous studies. We very specifically conducted this study
to follow-up and advance a specific thread of comparative antimicrobial research. We find it unlikely that
this line of research will stop being followed-up on after this study. At a minimum, we ourselves are
currently following-up this work.
55: ”secretion of antimicrobial compounds akin to our antibiotics.” What are these compounds? Akin to
which antibiotics?
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 6: The function is akin to our antibiotics, not necessarily the compounds (there is
major variation in the compound classes of human antibiotics as well). We have changed this sentence
to read: “…secretion of antimicrobial compounds whose function is akin to our antibiotics.” We now
discuss the classes of known antimicrobial secretions in the Discussion [see author response 3 above].
Line 64-68: How were these mentioned studies done? The same material and methods as used here?
What microbes were these hymenopterans tested against?
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 7: We state in lines 94-97 that, “Testing inhibition of Staphylococcus bacteria is
the standard technique to measure antimicrobial activity of insect compounds, and it is the same
approach used for all of the comparative studies in insect groups described above [11-13, 25, 26].” We
have slightly altered this sentence so that it is clear that this is the standard assay and has been used
for every comparative study on antimicrobials in social insects. We explain our choice in using this assay
further in lines 99-103, where we state: “Yet, because so little is known about the pathogens that are
most likely to affect ant species, particularly bacterial pathogens, we take the conservative approach of
considering bacteria that have been studied in other insect systems. Doing so offers us a common
benchmark to compare the strength of antimicrobial compounds across taxa and to evaluate current
theory.”
Line 82: “are known to secrete antibiotic compounds…” Antibiotic against what? Or what compounds
were found and what is their bioactivity?
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 8: This, indeed, needed more clarification. We have changed this line to include
this information: “The ancestor to all modern ants possessed a special pair of glands, the metapleural
glands, which when assayed in a number of ant species were found to secrete antibiotic compounds
effective against bacteria, fungi, and yeasts [20-22].” [lines 81-83]. See also author response 3 for
additional relevant changes.
Line 86: “produce antimicrobial compounds via other glands” Do these compounds have the same or
different properties? Are these considered more or less advanced?
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 9: We have added the following line, which points readers to an additional
citation that is a review of venom and metapleural gland sources of antimicrobials and makes the point
that both glandular secretions share properties of inhibiting a broad range of microbes: “In particular,
the venom gland has been identified as a source of compounds that are effective against
entomopathogenic fungi and bacteria [24, 25].”
The microbe used in this study is Staphylococcus epidermis. While reading, I wondered about the
relevance of using this microbe with respect to ant communities and it only became clear in the
Discussion that this microbe is not even a pathogen. The authors validate the use of this organism by
stating that others used it in their studies (Lines 93-96). I, however, do not think this is enough.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 10: There are several reasons why we focused on the microbe Staphylococcus
epidermis for our comparisons of antimicrobials and why we believe this is the most
appropriate/informative course. First, the reviewer rightly notes that we are replicating the methods
used by all previous studies comparing social insect antimicrobials, which we explain in paragraph 4 of
the introduction. We chose to replicate this assay in ants so that we could directly compare our findings
with the previous body of literature. If we used another microbe and found little inhibition from ants, we
would not be able to conclude whether ants differed from other social insect taxa or not.
Second, we wanted to assay general antimicrobial defenses rather than those specific to certain
pathogens. Choosing a known entomopathogen could potentially present new confounding factors. For
example, some ant species may have faced stronger selective pressures from a particular
entomopathogen than other species, which would result in a stronger antimicrobial response for one
pathogen but potentially not others. Therefore, we chose S. epidermidis because it is not a known
entomopathogen and would allow us to test general antimicrobial strength
The authors should have at least performed an experiment in which they challenge ants with this
microbe to see if their study would have any biological relevance. Especially, since the antimicrobials
produced by ants could have evolved to be very specifically working against true pathogens only. The
authors also correctly discuss this themselves in Lines 230-234. An experiment to see if interaction with
this species would elicit any reaction in the host at all would be the minimum needed.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 11: The focus of our study was to measure general antimicrobial activity rather
than specific activity against known pathogens. While the latter question is interesting, it is not the focus
of our current study. As stated above (responses 7 and 10), assaying against a non-pathogenic microbe
is a standard practice in the literature and has been for decades (see Veal et al. 1992, ref 7). To note,
we are currently developing new assays to test the effect of ant antimicrobials against known pathogens
(e.g. Metarhizium), but this addresses a different question than the ones we test here (i.e., whether
species have evolved pathogen-specific defenses rather than general antimicrobials).
It would, however, still have been better to use a true entomopathogen (or even better, multiple
entomopathogens) instead, because of the reason mentioned above. Co-evolution between pathogens
and hosts can lead to very species-specific strategies.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 12: We agree that using a known entomopathogen would be interesting, but this
would be another independent study. The strength and novelty of our study rests in the size of our
comparative data set, our methodological connections to previous, smaller, comparative data sets, and
our results which differ from what the current comparative literature would predict.
I could not find any information about how the ants for this study were collected. Were individuals
collected in the field and immediately placed in ethanol? Or were entire colonies collected, and
individuals taken from those colonies? I think this information could be relevant with respect to
antimicrobial compound production and thus the results. If ants were kept in the lab for some time,
where they are not challenged by pathogens etc., they might not necessarily produce antimicrobials?
Especially, if these compounds are costly to make.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 13: Thanks for pointing out this missing methodological information. We have
added and modified the following lines in the methods: “The species we sampled covered a broad
spectrum of ant diversity with members representing 18 genera from the four major ant subfamilies
(Dolichoderinae, Formicinae, Myrmicinae, and Ponerinae), and species-specific average mature colony
sizes that varied from 80 to 220,000 individuals. Care was taken to avoid sampling incipient colonies,
and workers were collected from the periphery of mature nests or just inside mature subterranean
nests. Workers were taken back to the laboratory, provided with water, separated from any soil that
accompanied their collection, and extracted within 24hours of collection. To extract putative
antimicrobial compounds, we sampled workers from 5 different colonies per species.” We took all
reasonable care to control for differences due to colony size or worker age (by focusing on foragers or
older workers at the surface of the nest). Future studies may compare effects of exposing workers to
pathogens before sampling, which may potentially stimulate the production of antimicrobial compounds.
This, again, would answer a different question and not directly compare with past comparative studies
on social insect antimicrobial activity.
If individual ants were collected, then the authors had no idea about the actual size of the colonies they
were collected from.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 14: See revised text from author response 13. We selected mature colonies for
all species and used published accounts of average colony size (see Table S1 for references). This
approach is also most appropriate for testing the hypothesis that species-specific investment in
antimicrobials is related to differences in their average colony sizes, not differences in colony size
relative to colony ontogeny. For many of the species we studied, measuring colony size is extremely
difficult, especially for supercolonial species like Argentine ants and Asian needle ants. Colonies of these
species can cover vast areas and reach into the hundreds of thousands of individuals.
Sure, we know from literature how large certain species’ colonies can get over time, but ants might
therefore produce less antimicrobials when the colony is still at a smaller size. Including collection
information could thus lead to an interesting discussion and questions that could be tested in a follow up
study.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 15: Agreed. We have added to explain that we only collected workers from
mature colonies as opposed to small, incipient colonies.
Some more background information about the extract preparation techniques would also be needed.
Ethanol was used, but are all antimicrobials soluble in ethanol? Will they all be washed off the ant using
ethanol? Does ethanol change anything about the bioactive properties of the compounds of interest?
What about the evaporation process? It could be, for instance, that the antimicrobials produced by
Solenopsis species are different from those produced by some other ants, and are more stable under the
extraction conditions. Some more information is thus needed here to interpret the results correctly.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 16: See author response 3 for the revisions made to explicitly state that the
known classes of compounds found in metapleural gland secretions would have been captured via our
extraction technique. Additionally, we agree with the reviewer that additional caveats are needed in the
discussion of these data to be clear that our study is not a definitive characterization of all possible
antimicrobials in ants. We have added the following to the third paragraph of the discussion:
“Furthermore, the sample extraction and preparation methods used in this study were modeled after
previous studies [11-13, 25, 26] for purposes of making this research comparable to those data sets.
However, it is possible that these methodologies obstruct our ability to fully assay all of the antimicrobial
compounds these species are producing.” We saw a trade off in either using published methodologies for
extracting surface compounds and comparing our data to those studies or focusing on a smaller set of
species and cataloguing their antimicrobial compounds as discussed in the last paragraph of the
introduction. The later path has already been taken in a few studies focused on individual ant species;
however, a broad comparison across many ant species had not. Therefore, we chose to use a
methodology that was already in the literature for doing these types of broad comparisons.
Regarding the OD readings, it would be informative to know more about the growth curve of S.
epidermis. How does this organism grow over time under these conditions? What is the average OD of
the positive control after 24h? Is this at the stationary phase of the growth curve or still within the
exponential phase? This would inform the reader if 24h incubation under these conditions is indeed
sufficient.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 17: We provided a schematic of this information in Supplemental figure 2, and
hope that the reviewer was able to access this. All of the growth curve data and inhibition data were
controlled for and compared to non-treatment growth curves from within one 96 well plate. Each of
those plates used the same bacterial stock. Any differences in each particular stock were therefore
accounted for in the data set. To be clearer, we have included an additional supplemental figure (Fig.
S3) that shows an example of the raw OD curve output for a complete plate (including staph controls
and treatments).
To reiterate, the claims made in e.g. Lines 196-200 and 201-203 cannot be deduced from the results in
this study. As detailed above, there are too many unknown variables that could have contributed here.
One of the reasons for the results to be inconclusive being the use of a microbial organism that is not
necessarily biologically relevant with respect to ant-antimicrobial responses.
AUTHOR RESPONSE 18: Our leading statement in these lines that “40% of the ant species we tested
exhibited no detectable inhibition of S. epidermidis growth” is purely an objective reporting of our data,
without any subjective interpretation. We understand the reviewer’s qualms about the interpretations
that followed, that they may have not fully acknowledged some untested variables. We hope that the
above responses and revisions to the manuscript have improved the presentation of our results and
interpretations to the reviewer’s liking. Secondly, we have revised the text referenced in this final
comment so that all of the stated conclusions are appropriately framed in the context of our paper’s
methodology (the underlines point out changes to that effect, especially indicating our focus on “general
antimicrobial activity” rather than pathogen-specific responses): “However, 40% of the ant species we
tested exhibited no detectable inhibition of S. epidermidis growth. This result is counter to our prediction
that social species generally invest in strong antimicrobials, which was based on previous comparative
studies of social insect antimicrobial inhibition of Staphylococcus bacteria. Instead, we found broad
variation in antimicrobial investment among lineages. Clearly, not all social insect species invest in
general antimicrobials and must therefore use alternative means for pathogen defense. Our analyses
indicate investment in general antimicrobials has evolved multiple times across the ant phylogeny (Fig.
1), but investment in antimicrobials seems to be independent of differences in colony size.”
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript documents two scientifically sound and original research results of wide interest across
scientific disciplines, that 1) there is significant heterogeneity in the antimicrobial activity of a diverse
range of ant species, and that 2) the microbial activity does not appear to scale with colony size. Both of
these results are striking in that they are completely unexpected based on existing theory.
Some additional comments:
Introduction, line 107: “We correct our models for worker body size and phylogenetic factors.” Perhaps it
is more accurate to say that these factors were taken into account than to say that the models were
corrected.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 19: changed to “We incorporate worker body size and phylogenetic factors into
our models.”
Methods, line 115: Instead of “Myrmycinae” I believe you mean “Myrmicinae”
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 20: changed
Methods, line 116: Was a colony of 220,000 individuals actually counted to determine its size, or were
these size metrics taken from someplace such as Wilson and Hölldobler’s table?
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 21: We have rewritten this statement to clarify that these are average sizes of
mature colonies. See author response 13 above for more details. We also report citations for average
colony size in Table S1.
Methods, line 117: What is meant by “independent”?
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 22: changed “independent” to “different” to be clearer
Methods, line 118: Perhaps clarify that this done with groups of 5, 10, 20, and 40 workers to test
varying levels of potential antimicrobial concentration.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 23: We rewrote the sentence to read: “To test different concentrations of
external compounds we extracted groups of 5, 10, 20, and 40 workers from each colony in 95% ethanol
for 24 hours”
Discussion, lines 201-213: In this discussion of the effects of colony (and body) size, some attention
could be focused on the (currently neglected) effects of allometry. Larger individuals (and larger
colonies) typically exhibit lower mass-specific metabolic rates. Would this pattern not then suggest that
larger individuals and larger colonies would invest less energy per-capita or per-surface-area on
antimicrobial defenses, just as is found for metabolism, growth rate, etc? Large colony size also confers
many other potential immune functions associated with spatial heterogeneity, division of labor, and
perhaps task specialization for antimicrobial policing.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 24: This is a really interesting point, but one that we might not be able to
address with our current dataset. One reason why we do not discuss this is that we did not find
correlations between antimicrobial investment and colony size or body size. If there was an allometry,
then we would expect to see reduced antimicrobial strength in species that form large colonies. This
captures our general point, though, which is that ant species are likely to use strategies other than
antimicrobials to control pathogens in their colonies. Further work on species that live in large, complex
colonies may shed light on the reviewer’s point, which is a good opportunity for follow up.
Discussion, line 238: there is a period instead of a comma following the word example.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 25: Corrected
Discussion, line 268-69: Frankly, I’m not fully convinced about this colony size effect (or lack thereof)
since there are many uncontrolled variables including the size of the actual colonies these workers were
sampled from (assuming species-typical estimates were used), developmental stage of the colonies, and
age or behavioral caste of the actual workers which were tested. Obviously, the authors’ statistical
analysis is solid and their reporting of a negative result is admirable and nothing should get in the way
of this being published (especially sins RSOS has publishing negative results as an explicit objective of
the journal)… but some transparency with regard to the potential shortcomings of this design and some
attention to future colony-size related research would be useful.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 26: We agree, we could be more explicit about our efforts to control for colony-
level variation. We have added the following sentence to the methods to further clarify our sampling
protocol and why we used estimates of mature colony sizes for our comparisons: “Care was taken in
avoiding sampling incipient colonies and samples consisted of workers taken at the periphery or just
inside subterranean nests of the largest nests in the collection location.” See author response 13 above
for more details about how this section was revised.
Figure 1: While this is an otherwise beautiful figure, the depiction of shaded circles for colony size is not
very useful. Perhaps the relevant metric could be log-transformed (and obviously explained as such in
the legend)?
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 27: Thanks. We agree that only large differences in colony size are visible in Fig.
1, which is why we show these differences more explicitly in Fig. 2 and present the raw numbers in
Table S1. We believe that leaving colony size in the current format for Fig. 1 accomplishes our general
goal of providing a broad overview of species differences without adding information that might be more
difficult to interpret, such as taking log values of colony size.
Figure 1: Could the concentration columns proceed from smallest to greatest in a left-to-right direction?
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 28: We have considered doing this both ways, and we prefer the current
approach. In its current form, the figure shows the values from weakest-inhibiting to strongest-
inhibiting.
Figure S1-S3: These figures are excellent and should be included in the main manuscript, not reserved
for the supplement, especially Figure S1.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE 29: We thank the reviewer for their complements. We would like to keep the
manuscript as focused and uncluttered as possible. For us, that means keeping methodological details
like the supplementary figures, out of the main manuscript. They are not needed for the reader to
understand our main points, but they are helpful when a reader would like to dive deeper into the
methodologies of the paper. Therefore, we feel they are best kept supplemental.
Appendix B
Associate Editor Comments to Author:
The comments of the reviewers have been addressed satisfactorily (although a few suggestions remain).
In addition, a third referee was invited to the review, and they had a positive view of the manuscript.
Overall, this manuscript addresses a deficiency in the social scaling literature, and will be a nice addition
to the field.
Prior to final acceptance, please consider the thoughtful comments of reviewer 1, who has additional
suggestions. Also, please consider moving figure S1 to the main text.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE – We are pleased with the decision, and we would like to thank you and the three
reviewers for their helpful comments that have improved our manuscript. We have added Fig. S1 to the
main text and addressed Reviewer 1’s additional comment below.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have addressed all my concerns appropriately
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Since my first review of this manuscript, the authors have revised it to address points raised by myself
and another reviewer.
Author responses to my review (#18-29) are satisfactory and I appreciate the changes that have been
made to address these points. The increased clarification with respect to colony size and field sampling
technique are especially useful. The only issue I would care to repeat is to urge the authors and editor to
include some of the supplemental figures in the main manuscript text, space permitting.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE – We have moved Figure S1 to the main text (now Fig. 1).
I don’t believe it is good form to raise new issues in a follow-up review that weren’t mentioned in the
first pass, but an idea occurred to me while reading the revised manuscript and it may be worth
mentioning. The idea is that not all bacteria are bad. As the authors mention (l. 271-273), the
cultivation of beneficial microbes may be a key factor in why some ant taxa produce broad spectrum
antibiotics or not. Since the authors mention this possibility, it isn’t necessary to change anything, but it
might be worth more than passing mention in a sentence. Work on ant colony bacterial mutualistic
symbionts by Corrie Moreau and others could be cited and connecting to that literature will definitely
improve the impact of this manuscript.

Formicidae). Myrmecological News 24: 43-69.
**AUTHOR RESPONSE – This is a great reference to include. We have added the following sentence to
the second to last paragraph of the discussion: “Ants also host a diversity of endosymbiotic microbes,
and similar to our findings for antimicrobial investment, certain ant lineages appear to be “hotspots” of
microbial diversity, while others harbor very few microbial symbionts [55].”
