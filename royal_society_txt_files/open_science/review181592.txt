The paper contains original material but is written unclearly. Overall, I think the paper can be
accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science if the authors should clarify the following
unclear questions.
1) What‘s the thickness of the CoMoO4 nanoflower-like structures? Is there any relationship
between the thickness and capacitance? I read the manuscript several times and found it very
preliminary with little data. To optimize synthesis condition, I strongly suggest the authors make
the performance comparison among more samples.
2) The title is unclear, and the English in text should be finely polished.

Hu et al described the fabrication of a layered hierarchical nano-structured CoMoO4 on nickel
foam by a facile two-step hydrothermal reaction following annealing treatment and their
applications for supercapacitor. The LH-CoMoO4 shows a high areal capacitance of 6.79 F cm-2,
which is much higher than the SL-CoMoO4 of 2.47 F cm-2. The nanostructured LH-CoMoO4
exhibits good conductivity and excellent cycle performance, which confirmed the importance of
nanostructures reported herein. This work affords an emerging and facile method to obtain
advanced energy materials. The reason for the excellent performance is also demonstrated. This
work is a very important contribution to Royal Society Open Science. It can be appeared as a full
paper after following revisions:
1. What is the areal loading of LH-CoMoO4? How they anchoring onto the Ni foam?
3
2. In Figure 3, ‘um’ should be updated as ‘µm’.
3. Figure 4e exhibits the cycle performance at 50 mA cm-2. The areal density is divided by the
surface of electrode or the active materials?
4. The recent advances in nanostructured electrode for supercapacitor application (e.g.
CoMoO4/Co1-xS hybrid on Ni foam for high-performance supercapacitors reported in J Energy
Chem 2018, 2, 478-485; CoMoO4–3D graphene hybrid electrodes reported in Adv Mater 2013, 26,
1044-1051; Hollow CoMoO4 spheres for supercapacitors reported in Chem Commun 2018, 54,

form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Dear editor and reviewers,
I am very pleased to hear from you, thank you very much for your
comments to my manuscript! According to your comments, a revision
is made for my paper, corrected sentences and words are marked with
red color in the revised paper. Some explanations are shown as follow:
REVIEWER REPORT(S):
Reviewer: 1
Comments:
The paper contains original material but is written unclearly.
Overall, I think the paper can be accepted for publication in Royal
Society Open Science if the authors should clarify the following
unclear questions.
Reply: We appreciate the reviewer for the encouraging comments, we
hope the revised manuscript can be more valuable and interesting to
the readers of Royal Society Open Science.
1. What‘s the thickness of the CoMoO4 nanoflower-like structures?
Is there any relationship between the thickness and capacitance? I
read the manuscript several times and found it very preliminary
with little data. To optimize synthesis condition, I strongly suggest
the authors make the performance comparison among more
samples.
Reply: We have marked the thickness of the CoMoO4 nanoflower-like
structures in Fig. 3f, and the thickness is about 4 µm. Yes, the
capacitive behavior of electrode can be effected by the thickness.
However, in this work, we only investigated the effects the loading
mass of the layered hierarchical CoMoO4 nano-structured arrays on
the areal capacitance.
2. The title is unclear, and the English in text should be finely
polished.
Reply: We agree with the reviewer’s comments. We have modified
the title and the English with red color in the revised paper.

1. What is the areal loading of LH-CoMoO4? How they anchoring
onto the Ni foam?
Reply: The areal loading of LH-CoMoO4 is 4.95 mg cm-2. The layered
hierarchical CoMoO4 nanostructured on the array is formed via
heterogeneous nucleation in the solution. After that, the nanostructured
CoMoO4 were deposited on the array by surface absorption.
2. In Figure 3, ‘um’ should be updated as ‘µm’.
Reply: Thanks for the reviewer’s remanding. We have updated ‘um’
with ‘µm’ in Figure 3.
3. Figure 4e exhibits the cycle performance at 50 mA cm-2. The
areal density is divided by the surface of electrode or the active
materials?
Reply: The areal density is divided by the surface of electrode, which
is also the active materials. This is because the surface of electrode is
fully covered by the active materials.
4. The recent advances in nanostructured electrode for
supercapacitor application (e.g. CoMoO4/Co1-xS hybrid on Ni foam
for high-performance supercapacitors reported in J Energy Chem
2018, 2, 478-485; CoMoO4–3D graphene hybrid
electrodes reported in Adv Mater 2013, 26, 1044-1051; Hollow
CoMoO4 spheres for supercapacitors reported in Chem Commun
2018, 54, 10355-10358) should be introduced in the revised
backgrounds.
Reply: Thanks for the reviewer’s remanding. The papers mentioned
by the reviewer are excellent works, and we have supplemented these
references, please see references 11, 12 and 13.
The manuscript has been revised according to your comments. We
hope the revised paper would satisfy you and the reviewers. If there
are any problems, please do not hesitate to contact me.
We are looking forward to hearing from you soon.
