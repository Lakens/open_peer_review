The manuscript entitled ‘Thermal behavior of walnut shells by TG-GC-MS analysis’ characterized
the pyrolysis behaviours of walnut shells. The paper was well written and structured. Minor
revisions are required prior to its acceptance.
Introduction: Beside the limitations presented by authors, TG-FTIR actually has some other
limitations
Page 3, Line 31-35: The final oven temperature (200°C) is recommended be higher in the future to
prevent the deposition of contaminants.
Page 3, Line 45: Authors please define the ‘conversion rate’.
Page 4, Line 29-38: Revise the symbol in parentheses after ‘first stage’, ‘second stage’ and ‘last
stage’. Authors please indicate the T ranges for the three pyrolysis stages. According to DTG
curve, in this work, the second stage should be around 200–500 °C.
Section 3.1: In terms of DTG curve, authors should also have some brief discussion on the effect
of heating rate on the peak temperature shift. The relevant references can be "Effect of the
Heating Rate on the Thermochemical Behavior and Biofuel Properties of Sewage Sludge
Pyrolysis." Energy & Fuels 2016, 30(3): 1564-1570 & "Catalytic Pyrolysis of Coffee Grounds Using
NiCu-Impregnated Catalysts." Energy & Fuels 2014, 28(1): 228-235.
Page 5, Line 23-28: Fig.4 and Table 2 rather than Fig.2 and Table 1 should be correct.
Table 2: Please also include the peak area percentage % of the compounds under each
temperature, and have some discussions as well.

The manuscript deals with the thermal behavior of walnut shells using TG-GC/MS. The authors
have made a relatively relevant discussion which makes this paper relevant to biomass thermal
decomposition. However, the degree of novelty and originality of this article is not so good. The
literature references is not up to date. And English language should be revised again.
Some details should be major revised as followed:
General:
The work on literature review is good but can be extended; however, the originality of this paper
is not so clear, since there are many articles available on the pyrolysis of biomass.
The scope of the investigation could have been more clearly stated, i.e. how this investigation
does contributes to new knowledge and what are the new results.
Discussion:
The result shows that a majority of the volatiles and gaseous compounds with different groups
from GC/MS data during walnut shells degradation. Could you explain this result from
substrate decomposition reaction and investigate pyrolysis mechanism? Please add walnut shells
pyrolysis kinetic analysis and give more relevant discussions or experimental data.

The authors studied the thermal degradation behaviour of walnut shells in pyrolysis conditions
by a thermogravimetric system at four different heating rates of 10, 20, 40 and 60 °C/min. They
calculated activation energy values by using distributed activation energy model. They
investigated pyrolysis products of walnut shells by a GC-MS system connected to
thermogravimetric system at four different temperatures (268, 347, 467 and 695°C).
The authors stated that reaction kinetic parameters were investigated by using DAEM. However,
the only kinetic parameter calculated was activation energy. The authors should correct their
statement throughout the manuscript, or they should give the values of other calculated kinetic
parameter such as frequency factor.
The first sentence (page 1, line 19-21) of the abstract should be reorganized to improve lucidity.
For instance: “The present study introduces thermogravimetry with gas chromatography – mass
spectrometry at four different heating rates to investigate the kinetic and thermal degradation
behaviour of walnut shell pyrolysis.”
The last sentence of the abstract (page 1, line 31-32) should be given in introduction part.
Page 2 line 10-11 (to analyse …. [9]) should be reorganized to improve lucidity.
In “Results and Discussion” part, page 4 line 41-42, the authors wrote that the peak of DTG
curves were shifted from 347 to 385 °C as the heating rate increased. The authors should give a
brief explanation about this shifting since the present work investigates the thermal degradation
behaviour at four different heating rates.
The authors may compare their calculated activation energy values with other available literature
data (For instance, “Thermogravimetric analysis of walnut shell as pyrolysis feedstock, J Therm
Anal Calorim (2011) 105:145–150)
The authors stated (page 5 line 22) that a matching degree >60% was accepted in detecting
products. In my opinion, for this kind of tentative assignments in GC-MS characterization, a
higher matching degree should be considered since 60% matching is pretty close to the situation
where a matching is 50% percent available and 50% of unmatching is also available. Thus, the
authors may consider to increase matching degree in order to enhance reliability of tentative
assignments in GC-MS characterization.
Page 5 line 53-54 (At 467°….. temperature.) should be reorganized to improve lucidity.
The noticed grammer/spelling mistakes are given below:
1) Page 2 line 15: “… were quantitatively and qualitatively analysis [9, 10, 11]” should be
corrected as “… were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed [9-11]”.
2) Page 3 line 12: “… and oxygen content was calculated with dry ash-free base by difference.”
should be corrected as “… and oxygen content was calculated on dry ash-free basis by
difference.”.
3) Page 3 line 16: “… at the heating rate of 10, 20, 40 and” should be corrected as “… at the
heating rates of 10, 20, 40 and”.
4) Page 3, line 26: “… thermos scientific” should be corrected as “… Thermo Scientific”.
5) Page 3, line 36: “… impsct” should be corrected as “… impact”.
6) Page 5, line 47: “… but amounts is increased.” should be corrected as “… but amounts were
increased.”.
7) Page 9 line 52: “TG (a) and DTG (b) curves of pyrolysis from walnut shells at different heating
rates” should be corrected as “TG (a) and DTG (b) curves of walnut shell pyrolysis at different
heating rates”

Response to comments:
Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript entitled ‘Thermal behavior of walnut shells by TG-GC-MS
analysis’ characterized the pyrolysis behaviours of walnut shells. The paper was well
written and structured. Minor revisions are required prior to its acceptance.
1. Introduction: Beside the limitations presented by authors, TG-FTIR actually has
some other limitations
According to the comments, the author added the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
2. The final oven temperature (200°C) is recommended be higher in the future to
prevent the deposition of contaminants.
Thanks to the reviewer's opinion, the author will improve in future research.
3. Page 3, Line 45: Authors please define the ‘conversion rate’.
According to the comments, the author added the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
4. Page 4, Line 29-38: Revise the symbol in parentheses after ‘first stage’, ‘second
stage’ and ‘last stage’. Authors please indicate the T ranges for the three pyrolysis
stages. According to DTG curve, in this work, the second stage should be around
200–500 °C.
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
5. Section 3.1: In terms of DTG curve, authors should also have some brief
discussion on the effect of heating rate on the peak temperature shift. The relevant
references can be "Effect of the Heating Rate on the Thermochemical Behavior and
Biofuel Properties of Sewage Sludge Pyrolysis." Energy & Fuels 2016, 30(3):
1564-1570 & "Catalytic Pyrolysis of Coffee Grounds Using NiCu-Impregnated
Catalysts." Energy & Fuels 2014, 28(1): 228-235.
According to the comments, the author added the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
6. Page 5, Line 23-28: Fig.4 and Table 2 rather than Fig.2 and Table 1 should be
correct
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
7. Table 2: Please also include the peak area percentage % of the compounds under
each temperature, and have some discussions as well.
In this paper, pyrolysis process were analyzed by TG-GC-MS. Pyrolysis products
were analyzed qualitatively rather than quantitative analysis. So there is no peak area
in Table 2. At the same time, the author also referred to the relevant literature, and
did not calculate the peak area.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript deals with the thermal behavior of walnut shells using TG-GC/MS.
The authors have made a relatively relevant discussion which makes this paper
relevant to biomass thermal decomposition. However, the degree of novelty and
originality of this article is not so good. The literature references is not up to date.
And English language should be revised again.
Most of the literature references are in recent 5 years, and the paper has been revised
by English native speakers.
1. The work on literature review is good but can be extended; however, the
originality of this paper is not so clear, since there are many articles available on the
pyrolysis of biomass.
In the second and third sections of Introduction, the author explains the methods,
mechanism, application of pyrolysis technology (TG-FTIR and TG-MS) in detail,
and explains the purpose and innovation of this research (TG-GC-MS). In the
revised manuscript, the author added corresponding contents based on reviewer’s
opinions.
2.The scope of the investigation could have been more clearly stated, i.e. how this
investigation does contributes to new knowledge and what are the new results.
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
3. The result shows that a majority of the volatiles and gaseous compounds with
different groups from GC/MS data during walnut shells degradation. Could you
explain this result from substrate decomposition reaction and investigate pyrolysis
mechanism? Please add walnut shells pyrolysis kinetic analysis and give more
relevant discussions or experimental data.
According to the comments, the author added the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
4. The reference style is based on the Journal.
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
Reviewer: 3
1. The authors stated that reaction kinetic parameters were investigated by using
DAEM. However, the only kinetic parameter calculated was activation energy. The
authors should correct their statement throughout the manuscript, or they should give
the values of other calculated kinetic parameter such as frequency factor.
According to the comments, the author corrected the statement throughout
manuscript.
2. The first sentence (page 1, line 19-21) of the abstract should be reorganized to
improve lucidity. For instance: “The present study introduces thermogravimetry with
gas chromatography – mass spectrometry at four different heating rates to
investigate the kinetic and thermal degradation behaviour of walnut shell pyrolysis.”
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
3. The last sentence of the abstract (page 1, line 31-32) should be given in
introduction part.
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
4. Page 2 line 10-11 (to analyse …. [9]) should be reorganized to improve lucidity.
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
5. In “Results and Discussion” part, page 4 line 41-42, the authors wrote that the
peak of DTG curves were shifted from 347 to 385 °C as the heating rate increased.
The authors should give a brief explanation about this shifting since the present
work investigates the thermal degradation behaviour at four different heating rates.
According to the comments, the author added the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
6. The authors may compare their calculated activation energy values with other
available literature data (For instance, “Thermogravimetric analysis of walnut shell
as pyrolysis feedstock, J Therm Anal Calorim (2011) 105:145–150)
According to the comments, the author added the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
7. The authors stated (page 5 line 22) that a matching degree >60% was accepted in
detecting products. In my opinion, for this kind of tentative assignments in GC-MS
characterization, a higher matching degree should be considered since 60%
matching is pretty close to the situation where a matching is 50% percent available
and 50% of unmatching is also available. Thus, the authors may consider to increase
matching degree in order to enhance reliability of tentative assignments in GC-MS
characterization.
In order to specify the matching degree of the product, the related contents were
reintroduced in the revised manuscript.
8. Page 5 line 53-54 (At 467°….. temperature.) should be reorganized to improve
lucidity.
The noticed grammer/spelling mistakes are given below:
1) Page 2 line 15: “… were quantitatively and qualitatively analysis [9, 10, 11]”
should be corrected as “… were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed [9-11]”.
2) Page 3 line 12: “… and oxygen content was calculated with dry ash-free base by
difference.” should be corrected as “… and oxygen content was calculated on dry
ash-free basis by difference.”.
3) Page 3 line 16: “… at the heating rate of 10, 20, 40 and” should be corrected as
“… at the heating rates of 10, 20, 40 and”.
4) Page 3, line 26: “… thermos scientific” should be corrected as “… Thermo
Scientific”.
5) Page 3, line 36: “… impsct” should be corrected as “… impact”.
6) Page 5, line 47: “… but amounts is increased.” should be corrected as “… but
amounts were increased.”.
7) Page 9 line 52: “TG (a) and DTG (b) curves of pyrolysis from walnut shells at
different heating rates” should be corrected as “TG (a) and DTG (b) curves of
walnut shell pyrolysis at different heating rates”
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
