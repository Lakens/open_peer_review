There is a (probably small, given the much larger external factors) mistake in the calculations. The
effect of this should be double checked and corrections carried out:
15-20 cm/s = 0.054-0.072 km/h is in error; it should be: 15-20 cm/s = 0.54-0.72 km/h.
(unless, the values were used before their erroneous conversion).
Otherwise the paper is well written and the data are convincing. Nevertless, I would be reluctant
to consider any conclusion - especially when our information content is limited (as in this case) -
as a "final solution".
Minor comments:
- In legends to SFigs: successes is
- In some figures some trajectories hit (and go through) Iceland and N-Scotland. These should
either be eliminated or commented.

In this work the authors aim at providing a final answer whether Vikings were potentially able to
navigate between nowadays' Norway and Greenland by solely relying on skylight polarization.
The hypothesis of polarimetric Viking navigation was raised quite some decades ago and the
research group of Gabor Horvath has already demonstrated a significant contribution to this
peculiar topic during recent years, and it clearly seems that with the current work they finally
attempt to arrive at a conclusion.
3
The prinicipal method employed in this paper is computer simulation of Viking sailing, using
previously obtained data that characterize the accuracy of orientation via the proposed procedure
for polarimetric navigation under various conditions of cloudiness. The simulation has a fair
number of variable input parameters and it was repeated 1000 times for a given "sunstone"
crystal type, part of the year (equinox/solstice) and periodocity of orientation procedure during
each simulated day.
The authors arrive at a very interesting conclusion, that is, by exclusively using the proposed
method of skypolarimetric navigation, and reorienting with a sufficient freuqency in the day, one
can securely arrive on a westbound route from Norway to the shores of Greenland, despite
cloudy conditions when the Sun cannot be seen. This is indeed a surprising discovery, given that
polarization signals can be weak in such conditions and there are numerous other factors that can
cause a significant orientation error based on the polarimetric method. The reason for this
unexpected success, as the authors discuss it, seems to be that the orientation errors during
forenoon and afternoon, even if one-by-one they can be significant, more or less cancel out each
other by the end of the day. The result is a zigzagging route, biasing northward in the forenoon
and southward in the afternoon, which sums up to remain straight in the west direction.
What is striking in the findings is that the simulations point to a 100% navigation success rate,
when orienation periodicity is high enough, regardless of all other conditions, however.
Now, of course, what needs to be checked, especially that the conclusions are quite surprising,
whether the simulations represent the various scenarios of polarimetric Viking voyage well. I'm
convinced that the authors introduced simulation parameters and set/varied their settings in a
meaningful way so that they could resemble sufficiently realistic scenarios, while at the same
time trying to avoid an overly complex simulation. Since it cannot be expected that such a
simulation be all-encompassing with respect to all kinds of physical/environmental/behavioral
conditions involved in the secific tasks, it naturally remains a compromise. The question
remains, however, if simulated polarimetric navigation-based voyages in the presented way are
capable of close resemblance to such a navigation if it were performed in reality (1) in themselves
and (2) in their statistical distribution. In this regard, although the authors try to provide
justficiation to certain paremeter settings and to the omission of some other conditions (e.g. drift
caused by wind, sea currents), I would say that it still remains somewhat arbitrary how the
relevant parameters were chosen and tuned throghout the simulations.
Specifically, I would need the authors to more elaboretaly answer and discuss:
- Whether simulating 1000 routes is enough (for a given set of conditions), that is, if it sufficiently
approximates the case of simulating infinite number of routes?
- Would it alter the results and conclusions, if strong changes in cloudiness condition within
small time were allowed, as opposed to the more conservative setting used in the paper?
- Is there any realworld data regarding the variation of cloudiness during a day, in various
seasons of the year in the relevant geographic region that could be used in the simulation and
what effect the authors would expect to their results?
- The simulations employ a fixed velocity of 11 km/h. If this were instead varied, either with a
random distribution or a distribution that is not symmetric with regard to forenoons and
afternoons, then what conclusions could be expected?
- If there were low visibility conditions in the vicinity of the Greenland shore so that mountains
cannot be seen despite in theory the curvature of the Earth allows for it, then would it represent a
hazard for a successful arrival of Viking sailors relying on polarimetric navigation?
- Would it be a fair conclusion, based on what the findings suggest, that it is not the periodicity of
navigation in itself what is important for higher success rates, but rather that the distribution of
4
times when the navigation procedur is carried out is as symmetric as possible with respect to the
timepoint of real noon?
On top of these questions I would suggest the authors to try to follow an alternative approach in
evaluating the question of how robust the found very high success rates are, with respect to
altering various parameters, conditions and potentially introducing some others, which are not
present in the current model. In such an evaluation the aim would be to find those parameter
settings, which result in a breakdown of the success rates. The paper explicitly shows such
example with the Delta_T periodicity, but it would be interesting to check other parameters as
well. If it can consistently shown that the breakdown of successful navigation only occurs with
simulated conditions that are far from (or rare) in reality, that would well show the robustness of
the presented findings.
I note that I would not expect that the authors perform yet another broad set of simulations for
this paper, but I do find it important that they elaborate their discussion on justifying the
arbitrary settings of simulation parameters, about the potential bias of simulated scenario
distributions vs. reality and on the question of robustness as per the very high navigation success
rates. I also have the opinion that the conclusion that can be drawn from such simulations, might
need to be refined and tuned down somewhat in order to avoid potentially premature claims
about a final answer that polarimetric navgiation method indeed works with a 100% success rate
(with frequent measurements).
Apart from this, probably it would be interesting to extend these kind of simulations to other
parameters and add more complexity for future work in a separate paper, and a realworld test of
the polarimetric navigation method were even more interesting.
That said, I find the paper definitely worth for publishing after a minor revision.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
This is a fascinating topic, to which the authors have already contributed greatly. In this paper,
the authors draw together some of their previous analyses of elements of the navigational process
to establish the overall performance of the polarimetric technique for simulated voyages between
Norway and Greenland. It is certainly publishable work, although the manuscript would benefit
from some revision.
My comments fall into three categories: the structure of the manuscript; the scientific method and
results; and detailed comments and corrections.
Structure
Ramskous suggestion that the Vikings could have navigated under cloud by determining the
polarization of daylight, and the investigations, hypotheses and analyses that it prompted, make
a great story and, perhaps in the spirit of the Norse sagas, the authors delight in repeating it in
full in each of their papers. This previously-described background material could be addressed
more succinctly.
The paper then has two separate strands: the main focus is the theoretical accuracy of the
polarimetric navigation technique, derived using the uncertainties established in the authors
extensive research; and the authors also consider some practical difficulties, solutions and rather
more speculative considerations of the likely success. The paper loses clarity in places by
muddling these two aspects together. It would be clearer to reserve comments about winds,
storms, currents etc. until after the discussion of the simulation results. It might then be
appropriate to mention supporting and mitigating navigational methods  wave direction, solar
midday elevation, erring to the north, proximity of the Faroes or Shetland Isles etc.  that might
have improved the overall navigational reliability, and perhaps some of the difficulties that
would have been encountered too.
Scientific method and results
I was puzzled by the measurements of ref [14] and how they were used in the simulations of this
paper. The caption to the colour matrices of [14] state that they show the mean uncertainties and
their standard errors, whereas p2 line 54 of the manuscript refers to the average deviation and its
standard error. Perhaps the confusion is over the distinction between a navigational deviation
and a statistical standard deviation. It would be helpful for the authors to clarify this. Reference
to the standard error adds to the confusion, since this depends upon the number of samples over
which the result is averaged; here it is presumably the distribution that is of interest.
It would be interesting and appropriate to include more details of the simulation results. What
was the uncertainty (standard deviation) in latitude by the time the ships reached or were abeam
Greenland? Why was the distribution not symmetrical about the target destination? What were
the relative contributions of the different uncertainties to the overall variation, and which were
dominant or insignificant?
The authors appear to have assumed all errors to have been randomly distributed about the true
values. In a linear process, such errors can always be reduced to an arbitrarily low level by
performing enough measurements. Here, one would expect the nonlinearity of the great circle
extrapolation and sun-compass processes in determining the latitude to result in an asymmetrical
distribution about the ideal; but what of other systematic, rather than random, errors? It would
be interesting to know the navigational error that resulted from a 1 degree error in the crystal
marking, for example, or if the deduced solar elevation were consistently over/under-estimated
by 5%. Should the phase of the navigation times relative to sunrise or midday have been
randomized to avoid the temporal interference artefacts?
6
The detailed structure in the blue visibility borderlines of Figs 1 and 3 (and supplementary
figures) is curious: given that the only object to block the view is the spherical ocean surface, one
would expect a series of arcs around the mountain peaks. The authors might note that the
calculation of dipping distances (Supp. Fig. S37) is a standard component of visual maritime
navigation, albeit rarely tabulated for objects as high as mountains; in determining the elevations
of heavenly bodies, atmospheric refraction is also taken into account.
Detailed comments
title final solution is a somewhat extravagant claim, and to older memories unhappily
reminiscent of Nazi atrocities
p2 line 6 sun-compass is unlikely to be universally familiar; suggest giving a reference
p2 line 7 spelling: intensely
p2 line 16 rodlet is not, to the best of my knowledge, a word commonly used beyond
cell biology. Suggest small rod  or omit and stick to gnomon
p2 line 41 I suspect the authors mean his minds eye; but it might be clearer to explain
that the navigator extrapolates by eye to find the intersection
p2 line 54 The final ... enigma of its success seems rather purple prose for a scientific
publication. Suggest omitting this sentence and modifying the following sentence to explain that
the authors here combine their previous results, together with simulations of navigated passages,
to determine the likelihood that the voyages would successfully reach their intended destinations
p3 line 1 simulated a thousand
p3 line 7 approached within a critical distance of the coastline of Greenland/of the
Greenland coastline
p3 line 36 The navigation errors cause the sailing route to deviate
p3 line 56 error functions might be misinterpreted as the mathematical functions of that
name; rephrase
p4 line 7 it would be helpful to explain explicitly the meanings of tau and Delta t
p4 line 8 watch could be confused with the nautical meaning; suggest timepiece
p4 line 9 (and elsewhere) error could mean uncertainty or mistake/inaccuracy; suggest
using more precise terminology
p4 line 17 how is (rho + Delta rho) constrained to the range 0-8?
p4 line 23 the Vikings were assumed to stop their ships
p4 line 24 assumed to be constant
p4 line 41 unlikely to be 1000 km; 10 or 100 km perhaps?
p6 line 11 pulled off is strange phrasing; would the conventional lowered their sails be
appropriate? Also lines 14, 15
p6 line 12 Polaris, presumably
p6 line 12 omit not

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a fascinating topic, to which the authors have already contributed greatly. In this paper,
the authors draw together some of their previous analyses of elements of the navigational process
to establish the overall performance of the polarimetric technique for simulated voyages between
Norway and Greenland. It is certainly publishable work, although the manuscript would benefit
from some revision.
My comments fall into three categories: the structure of the manuscript; the scientific method and
results; and detailed comments and corrections.
12
Structure
Ramskous suggestion that the Vikings could have navigated under cloud by determining the
polarization of daylight, and the investigations, hypotheses and analyses that it prompted, make
a great story and, perhaps in the spirit of the Norse sagas, the authors delight in repeating it in
full in each of their papers. This previously-described background material could be addressed
more succinctly.
The paper then has two separate strands: the main focus is the theoretical accuracy of the
polarimetric navigation technique, derived using the uncertainties established in the authors
extensive research; and the authors also consider some practical difficulties, solutions and rather
more speculative considerations of the likely success. The paper loses clarity in places by
muddling these two aspects together. It would be clearer to reserve comments about winds,
storms, currents etc. until after the discussion of the simulation results. It might then be
appropriate to mention supporting and mitigating navigational methods  wave direction, solar
midday elevation, erring to the north, proximity of the Faroes or Shetland Isles etc.  that might
have improved the overall navigational reliability, and perhaps some of the difficulties that
would have been encountered too.
Scientific method and results
I was puzzled by the measurements of ref [14] and how they were used in the simulations of this
paper. The caption to the colour matrices of [14] state that they show the mean uncertainties and
their standard errors, whereas p2 line 54 of the manuscript refers to the average deviation and its
standard error. Perhaps the confusion is over the distinction between a navigational deviation
and a statistical standard deviation. It would be helpful for the authors to clarify this. Reference
to the standard error adds to the confusion, since this depends upon the number of samples over
which the result is averaged; here it is presumably the distribution that is of interest.
It would be interesting and appropriate to include more details of the simulation results. What
was the uncertainty (standard deviation) in latitude by the time the ships reached or were abeam
Greenland? Why was the distribution not symmetrical about the target destination? What were
the relative contributions of the different uncertainties to the overall variation, and which were
dominant or insignificant?
The authors appear to have assumed all errors to have been randomly distributed about the true
values. In a linear process, such errors can always be reduced to an arbitrarily low level by
performing enough measurements. Here, one would expect the nonlinearity of the great circle
extrapolation and sun-compass processes in determining the latitude to result in an asymmetrical
distribution about the ideal; but what of other systematic, rather than random, errors? It would
be interesting to know the navigational error that resulted from a 1 degree error in the crystal
marking, for example, or if the deduced solar elevation were consistently over/under-estimated
by 5%. Should the phase of the navigation times relative to sunrise or midday have been
randomized to avoid the temporal interference artefacts?
The detailed structure in the blue visibility borderlines of Figs 1 and 3 (and supplementary
figures) is curious: given that the only object to block the view is the spherical ocean surface, one
would expect a series of arcs around the mountain peaks. The authors might note that the
calculation of dipping distances (Supp. Fig. S37) is a standard component of visual maritime
navigation, albeit rarely tabulated for objects as high as mountains; in determining the elevations
of heavenly bodies, atmospheric refraction is also taken into account.

p of these questions I would suggest the authors to try to follow an alternative approach in
ting the question of how robust the found very high success rates are, with respect to altering
s parameters, conditions and potentially introducing some others, which are not present in the
t model. In such an evaluation the aim would be to find those parameter settings, which result in
kdown of the success rates. The paper explicitly shows such example with the Delta_T
icity, but it would be interesting to check other parameters as well. If it can consistently shown
e breakdown of successful navigation only occurs with simulated conditions that are far from (or
n reality, that would well show the robustness of the presented findings.
r: The Editor and the other two Reviewers required only minor revision within 7 days. The
suggested additional very time-consuming computer simulations cannot be performed within 7
Furthermore, if we performed all these new simulations, their results would be so voluminous
ey could not be embedded into our revised paper which is already long in its present form. All
new simulations can be the subject of future studies and their results can be published in a
te paper. As suggested by Referees 2 and 3, in the revised Discussion we wrote the following:
We simulated 100, 500 and 1000 Viking sailing routes for the six different situations (equinox +
e, calcite + cordierite + tourmaline sunstone crystals), and experienced that the navigation
ses converged toward the values presented in this work (obtained for 1000 routes). For
rison, we also performed 10000 sailing route simulations for some parameter settings, but did
tain significant differences in the success rate compared to the corresponding 1000 simulations,
2
e computation time increased tenfold. From this we concluded that simulating 1000 routes was
h (for a given set of conditions), that is, it sufficiently approximated the case of simulating much
(infinite) route numbers and the computation time could be kept optimally low.
Let us estimate the realistic total number of routes of a Viking ship during the nearly 300 years
Viking era: The duration of a complete route from Norway to Greenland and back to Norway
be minimum 6 weeks. The sailing period might have been between April and September (when
lantic Ocean was iceless along the 61o latitude), meaning yearly 6 × 4 = 24 weeks, during which
plete to-and-back routes could be done with a given ship. Thus, during 300 years, a given ship
perform 4 × 300 = 1200 complete routes between Norway and Greenland. Due to ship
zation and bad weather conditions this is an overestimated number. More realistic is about 1000
ete routes for a ship, if it was always more or less repaired after every route.
During a pilot simulation we have varied the constant velocity v of the Viking ship, the typical
of which was 11 km/h (5). We obtained the trivial result that a decrease/increase of v resulted in
e increase/decrease of the time after which the simulated ship reached Greenland from Norway
t any significant change in the navigation success. In future studies, the ship velocity v could be
either with a random distribution or according to a function of cloudiness or a distribution that
symmetric with regard to forenoons and afternoons. However, according to our pilot simulations,
not expect significant changes of the navigation success from the randomization of v. On the one
an asymmetry of the distribution of v-values relative to forenoons and afternoons could trivially
e or decrease the navigation success, if the forenoon or afternoon v-values were tendentiously
, because the sailing routes would tendentiously deviate northward (helping to reach somewhere
astline of Greenland) or southward (hindering to reach Greenland). On the other hand, we do not
any physical/meteorological phenomenon that could result in such an asymmetry of v.
In our simulations we assumed that the visibility of the coastline of Greenland is good and
nt. The calculated borderline-coastline distance used by us (Supplementary Fig. S37) is valid
or a clear atmosphere. It can be reduced up to zero in fog or heavy rain. If there were low
ty conditions in the vicinity of the Greenland shore (so that mountains cannot be seen despite in
the curvature of the Earth allows for it), the navigation success would obviously decrease. In
worlds, this would represent a hazard for a successful arrival of Viking sailors relying on sky-
metric navigation. Note that the calculation of dipping distances is a standard component of
maritime navigation (albeit rarely tabulated for objects as high as mountains), and in determining
vations of heavenly bodies, atmospheric refraction is also taken into account. We neglected the
tmospheric optical effect in our simulation.
As a logical continuation of our present simulations, in the future it would also be interesting to
m the following studies:
How would the navigation success change, if strong changes in cloudiness condition within
small time period(s) were allowed, as opposed to the more conservative setting used in this
work?
If some real-world data regarding the variation of cloudiness during a day, in various seasons of
the year in the relevant geographic region (along the 61o latitude) would be accessible
(presently we do not know such data source), new simulations could be done. However, we
expect that with such a study only the trivial result could be obtained that more frequently occur
strongly cloudy skies, the larger is the decrease of the navigation success.
It would also be interesting to know (i) the navigational uncertainty that resulted from a given
(e.g. ±1o) error in the sunstone crystal marking, or (ii) how the change of the (constant or
randomized) phase of the first navigation time relative to sunrise influences the navigation
success. Note that in our simulations this phase was always zero, that is the first navigation
3
procedure (i.e. determination of the intended sailing direction) happened immediately after
sunrise. It is logical to assume, that Vikings set sail immediately at sunrise when they had the
opportunity to continue their journey. The effect of consistent over/underestimations of the
deduced solar elevation was measured by Száz et al. (20) and was included in the computation
of the <U+03B8>-<U+03C1> matrix of the North uncertainties (21).
Further simulations could also answer the question: How robust the found very high navigation
success rates are, with respect to altering various parameters and environmental/meteorological
conditions? The aim of such an approach could be to find those parameter settings, which result
in a breakdown of the success rates. Our present paper explicitly shows such an example for
navigation periodicities <U+0394>t = 4, 5 and 6 hours (Fig. 2), but it would be interesting to check other
parameters as well. If it could be consistently shown that the breakdown of successful
navigation only occurs with simulated conditions that are far from (or rare) in reality, that
would well demonstrate the robustness of our findings presented here.
e 2 wrote: - Would it be a fair conclusion, based on what the findings suggest, that it is not the
icity of navigation in itself what is important for higher success rates, but rather that the
ution of times when the navigation procedur is carried out is as symmetric as possible with
t to the timepoint of real noon?
r: We thank Referee 2 for this valuable remark, on the basis of which we wrote the following in
ised Discussion:
ndings suggest that it is not only the navigation periodicity <U+0394>t in itself that is important for higher
tion success rates, but also the distribution of times when the navigation procedure is carried out
mmetrical as possible with respect to the time point of real noon.
e 2 wrote: I note that I would not expect that the authors perform yet another broad set of
tions for this paper, but I do find it important that they elaborate their discussion on justifying the
ry settings of simulation parameters, about the potential bias of simulated scenario distributions
lity and on the question of robustness as per the very high navigation success rates. I also have
inion that the conclusion that can be drawn from such simulations, might need to be refined and
down somewhat in order to avoid potentially premature claims about a final answer that
metric navgiation method indeed works with a 100% success rate (with frequent measurements).
Apart from this, probably it would be interesting to extend these kind of simulations to other
eters and add more complexity for future work in a separate paper, and a realworld test of the
metric navigation method were even more interesting.
r: As mentioned above, in the revised Discussion we addressed the above-suggested new
tion possibilities, the results of which will be published in a separate paper. At the end of the
Discussion we wrote:
mous theory/hypothesis of sky-polarimetric Viking navigation (8) is frequently cited (3, 5, 9-22,
. Now, we showed that this navigation method can function well under cloudy skies on a voyage
varying cloudiness, if the navigation periodicity <U+0394>t is small enough and is distributed
etrically before and after the time point of the real noon. Nobody knows whether the Vikings
have used this method. However, if they have, they could navigate with it precisely. Further
(simulations) could decide whether the found high (90-100%) navigation success rates for small
tion periodicities <U+0394>t = 1-3 hours are robust enough under various environmental conditions.

Point-by-Point Response to the Comments of Reviewer 3

e 1, Referee 2 and Referee 3 are marked by blue, green and red, respectively. Below we give our
se to the points of Reviewer 3.
e 3 wrote: Structure - Ramskou's suggestion that the Vikings could have navigated under cloud
ermining the polarization of daylight, and the investigations, hypotheses and analyses that it
ted, make a great story and, perhaps in the spirit of the Norse sagas, the authors delight in

sed more succinctly.
r: As suggested, the Introduction was considerably shortened by deleting the following two
aphs:
ompass was composed of a disc and a small rod, called gnomon, oriented normal to the disc. In a
day at a given latitude the disc was held horizontally and the trajectory of the tip of the
ns shadow was engraved into the disc from sunrise to sunset. At least two gnomonic curves
ngraved: a straight line and a hyperbola belonging to the day of spring equinox (21 March) and
er solstice (21 June), respectively (17). The mirror symmetry axis of these gnomonic curves is
ographic north-south direction that was also marked on the disc (17). If a Viking sailor wanted to
ine the northern direction as the basis of his navigation, in sunshine he rotated the horizontal
ound its vertical gnomon until the gnomons tip reached the appropriate gnomonic curve, and
e engraving meaning north on the disc pointed towards the geographic north. Experimental tests
roven the reliability of this method called solar Viking navigation (17).
h the following four steps (1, 14): (i) After the calibration of two sunstones in clear weather
cloudless sky) by marking the direction pointing towards the sun in a well recognizable crystal
ent (e.g. where the intensity of transmitted skylight is minimal or maximal), the Viking
tor adjusted the sunstones in cloudy weather at two different celestial points by rotating both in
f his eyes, through which he could determine the directions perpendicular to the local direction
light polarization. (ii) At this sunstone alignment, the previously carved markings gave the
ons of two celestial great circles, in the intersection of which the occluded sun is found. The
tor found this intersection with extrapolating by eye these great circles. (iii) After the position of
isible sun was found, the navigator measured the solar elevation above the horizon with his fists
gers to reproduce the gnomons shadow for the sun-compass. (iv) Finally, a shadow-stick of the
mpass was aligned parallel to the meridian of the invisible sun.
e 3 wrote: The paper then has two separate strands: the main focus is the theoretical accuracy of
larimetric navigation technique, derived using the uncertainties established in the authors'
ive research; and the authors also consider some practical difficulties, solutions and rather more
ative considerations of the likely success. The paper loses clarity in places by muddling these
pects together. It would be clearer to reserve comments about winds, storms, currents etc. until
he discussion of the simulation results. It might then be appropriate to mention supporting and
ting navigational methods - wave direction, solar midday elevation, erring to the north, proximity
Faroes or Shetland Isles etc. - that might have improved the overall navigational reliability, and
s some of the difficulties that would have been encountered too.
