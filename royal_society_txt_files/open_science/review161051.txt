Lin et al reported a simple electrochemical way to prepare carbon QDs and the application in
building a carbon QDs/TiO2 hybrids photoelectrode for water oxidation. It was observed that the
anodic photocurrent was evidently enhanced in comparison with that without carbon dots,
which showed the importance of carbon dots in the effective separation of excited charger-
carriers in the light irradiation. In general, the results are technique sound and supported by the
experimental along with proper discussions. However, to improve the quality of the manuscript,
I would like to recommend its publication in Royal Society Open Science with a major revision as
listed as follows:
(1) The experimental details of how to deposit carbon QDs on TiO2 nanowires should be
given. Moreover, it is better to show a scheme to make the presentation more vivid.
(2) The HRTEM image of carbon QDs is of low quality. It is difficult to see any dots of
uniform distribution. Moreover, the crystallinity of carbon QDs is interesting, for instance, the
graphitic lattice was observed in the HRTEM images?
(3) It is suggested to compare the proposed technique with previous electrochemical way
(e.g. ref. 7: Angewandte Chemie International Edition. 2010, 49, 4430) to prepare carbon QDs.
How about the stability and PL quantum yield?
(4) 0 V vs. AgAgCl in a three electrode system does not mean the absolute biased potential
between working electrode and counter electrode in practical applications is zero. Thus, it is
suggested to show the influence of the biased potential on the photocurrent via a LSV curve
under a chopped light (cf. Lou et al., ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2016, 8, 22287) along with
proper discussion of the results.
(5) To given readers a more comprehensive research background, the progress of preparation of
carbon dots, including the surface passivation and doping (e.g. Zhou et al., ACS Nano 2015, 9,
12480) should be included in the introduction.

The authors reported the development of carbon quantum dots-decorated TiO2 nanowires for
water photooxidation. The work is interesting and I believe that it will receive wide readerships
especially in the field of photocatalysis, energy and materials science. This work could be
considered for the publication in Royal Society Open Science after appropriate revisions from the
authors to further improve the quality of the manuscript. Specific comments are shown below:
1. I would suggest the authors to make modification to the present title. It should be
“titanium dioxide” instead of “titanium”, since both show different meanings.
2. There is a lack of recent important works on the carbon dots provided in the
introduction. More emphasis on the recent works should be paid.

4. FTIR spectra of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and the CQD/TiO2 hybrid should be
provided in the revised manuscript.
5. XPS analysis for the studied samples (CQD and CQD/TiO2) should be conducted for
examining the chemical status and environment of each element, i.e. C, O, and Ti.

lattice spacing of both CQD and TiO2 to prove the formation of heterojunction structure in the
nanocomposite.
7. The authors have performed the EIS Nyquist plot analysis. Fitting to the EIS Nyquist
plots is essential. A table summarizing the resistivity value of each element should be provided.
Please provide the discussion on this section.
8. Based on the transient photocurrent analysis, the photocurrent of CQD/TiO2 was
greater than that of TiO2 nanowires. I would suggest the authors to perform steady state PL
analysis to study the charge carrier trapping and recombination process.
9. Since the manuscript title mentions the photooxidation of H2O, the evolution rate of O2
should be studied and determined for both TiO2 nanowires and CQD/TiO2 samples. This piece
of information should be included in the revised manuscript.

Appendix A
Dear editor and reviewers:
Thank you for your decision letter on Feb. 08, 2017 concerning the manuscript of
label_version_2
RSOS-161051. The manuscript has been revised according to the all of comments.
The major corrections are as follows:
Reviewer: 1
(1) The experimental details of how to deposit carbon QDs on TiO2 nanowires should
be given. Moreover, it is better to show a scheme to make the presentation more
vivid.
<U+2192> The experimental details of fabrication of CQDs/TiO2 NW was add in manuscript
(the description is on page 3, line 28<U+2015>31). Furthermore, a scheme of the three
electrode system for preparation of CQDs/TiO2 NWwas provide in supporting
information, figure S1, please go through it.
(2) The HRTEM image of carbon QDs is of low quality. It is difficult to see any dots
of uniform distribution. Moreover, the crystallinity of carbon QDs is interesting, for
instance, the graphitic lattice was observed in the HRTEM images?
<U+2192> The resolution of TEM image was adjusted to 300 dpi* 300dpi and 300 ppi* 300
ppi by Photoshop. From HRTEM images, as show in figure 1d and 1e, the size
distribution of CQDs is from 0.5-4 nm and it present the average lattice spacing of
CQDs as 0.323 nm, corresponding to (002) planes of graphite.
Figure 1. (d) and (e) HRTEM images of CQDs.
(3) It is suggested to compare the proposed technique with previous electrochemical
way (e.g. ref. 7: Angewandte Chemie International Edition. 2010, 49, 4430) to prepare
carbon QDs. How about the stability and PL quantum yield? (Reminder: ref. 7 in
previous manuscript is the ref. 31 in new one.)
<U+2192> In this manuscript, the significantly different between this work and previous
report is the usage of ultra-pure water as electrolyte. It does not need chemicals
(strong acid or base, solvents), surface passive agents and post-treatment (the detail
description is on page 2, line 26<U+2015>34). The luminescence properties and appearance of
as-prepared CQDs solution remains unchanged after storing for 10 month in air at
room temperature (figure S2). Therefore, it exhibits good stability. Usually, the
quantum yield of CQDs is related lower than semiconductor QDs. Therefore, we do
not further investigate PL quantum yield of CQD solution.
Figure S2. PL spectra of CQD solution on 2016.06 and 2017.03.
(4) 0 V vs. AgAgCl in a three electrode system does not mean the absolute biased
potential between working electrode and counter electrode in practical applications is
zero. Thus, it is suggested to show the influence of the biased potential on the
photocurrent via a LSV curve under a chopped light (cf. Lou et al., ACS Appl. Mater.
Interfaces 2016, 8, 22287) along with proper discussion of the results.
<U+2192> Sorry about the description of parameters for measuring is not clear and definite.
Actually, the LSV curve and I-t curve were measured in every experiment. The 0V vs.
AgAgCl was a voltage which was select for comparing photocurrent. It does not mean
that the experiment was perform on absolute biased potential is zero. Both LSV curve
and I-t curve were provide with proper discussion in revised manuscript.
Measurements of linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) and photocurrent density versus
elapsed time (I<U+2015>t) of CQDs/TiO2 NW and as-prepared TiO2 NW devices were carried
out under AM 1.5G sunlight illumination, as shown in figure 5a and 5b. It is
important to note that a photocurrent density of 160 µA/cm2 at 0 V vs.Ag/AgCl for
CQDs/TiO2 NW was remarkably obtained and a net enhancement ratio of 6.4 was
achieved as compared with as-prepared TiO2 electrode (25 µA/cm2). From figure 5b,
both of two photoanode devices represented a good reproducibility and stability as the
illumination was continually turned on and off. Furthermore, the sharp spike in the
photocurrent during the on/off illumination cycles demonstrates the predominant
transport of photo generated electron in the CQDs/TiO2 NW.
Figure 5. (a) LSV curve and (b) I<U+2015>t curve of TiO2 NW and CQDs/TiO2 NW under

(5) To given readers a more comprehensive research background, the progress of
preparation of carbon dots, including the surface passivation and doping (e.g. Zhou et
al., ACS Nano 2015, 9, 12480) should be included in the introduction.
<U+2192> Thank you for your suggestion. The progress of preparation of carbon dots were
described in the introduction, please go through it. (the description is on page 2, line
26<U+2015>34).

1. I would suggest the authors to make modification to the present title. It should be
“titanium dioxide” instead of “titanium”, since both show different meanings.
<U+2192> Thank you for your reminder. We’ve modified it.
2. There is a lack of recent important works on the carbon dots provided in the
introduction. More emphasis on the recent works should be paid.

<U+2192> Thank you for your suggestion. The introduction was revised as your suggestion
and the references were cite in manuscript, please go through it.
3. The authors should introduce TiO2 as the semiconductor photocatalysts in the
introduction. Relevant important works on TiO2 should be given merits for wider
readerships.

(6) Nanoscale, 2013, 5, 3601-3614
<U+2192> Thank you for your suggestion. The introduction was revised as your suggestion
and the references were cite in manuscript, please go through it.
4. FTIR spectra of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and the CQD/TiO2 hybrid should be
provided in the revised manuscript.
<U+2192> FTIR spectra was record by FTIR spectrometer (BRUKER/Vertex 70V). Few
drops of CQD solution were dried on FTO for measuring FTIR spectra. However, it is
difficult to obtain observable signal of CQDs which may due to technical problem or
sample preparation.
CQDs
Intensity (a.u.)
800 1200 1600 2000 2400 2800 3200 3600 4000
Wavenumber (cm-1)
Instead of CQD’s sample, the FTIR spectra of TiO2 NW and CQDs/TiO2 NW were
received as show in figure 3c. As shown in figure 3c, the peak for Ti-O-Ti and Ti-O
was present in the range of 600-800 and 1024 cm-1, respectively. The characteristic
transmittance peaks of the CQD/TiO2 at 1648 cm-1 associated with the C=O
stretching vibration, indicate the existence of CQDs in the composites. Moreover, the
broad peak at 3369 cm-1 was attributed to vibrations of surface adsorbed water.
Figure 3. (c) FTIR spectra of TiO2 NW and CQDs/TiO2 NW.
5. XPS analysis for the studied samples (CQD and CQD/TiO2) should be conducted
for examining the chemical status and environment of each element, i.e. C, O, and Ti.
<U+2192> XPS of CQD/TiO2 was conducted by ULVAC-PHI, PHI 5000 VersaProbe /
Scanning ESCA Microprobe. Fitting of the XPS data was accomplished using
XPSPEAK41 software. XPS was carried out to investigate the components and
surface properties of CQD/TiO2 composite which show in figure 4. The full survey
spectrum of figure 4a indicates the presence of titanium (Ti 2p), carbon (C 1s), and
oxygen (O 1s) in the CQD/TiO2 composites. The Ti 2p spectra were deconvoluted and
resolved into four spin orbit components at 2p3/2 binding energies 457.6, 458.14 eV
and their corresponding 2p1/2 components (463.21, 464.0 eV) which are assigned as
Ti3+ (TiOOH/ coordinatively unsaturated) and Ti4+ (TiO2), respectively. The large ratio
of Ti3+ suggested due to the increase electron content of lattice surface of TiO2 within
the voltage-driven reduction process. The peaks at 284.24, 285.44 and 287.99 eV for
C 1s spectrum are ascribed to C–C bond with sp2 orbital, C–O and C=O bonds,
respectively. The main peak of O 1s spectrum at 529.06, 530.49 and 531.49 eV is
attributed to Ti=O, C=O and C–OH, respectively.
Figure 4. XPS spectra of CQDs/TiO2 NW. (a) Full survey. (b) Ti 2p spectra. (c) C 1s
spectra. (d) O 1s spectra.
6. I would suggest the authors to provide the HRTEM image of CQD/TiO2 to show
the lattice spacing of both CQD and TiO2 to prove the formation of heterojunction
structure in the nanocomposite.
<U+2192> It was observed that TiO2 NWs have a diameter of 30 nm and the dark dots in the
TEM image represent the CQDs. Moreover, the distance between the adjacent lattice
fringes is 0.325 nm and 0.223 nm, which can be assigned to the interplane distance of
the rutile TiO2 (110) plane and (101) planes of graphite (JCPDS card: No 65-6212)
(figure S3).
Figure S3. HRTEM images of CQDs/TiO2 NW.
7. The authors have performed the EIS Nyquist plot analysis. Fitting to the EIS
Nyquist plots is essential. A table summarizing the resistivity value of each element
should be provided. Please provide the discussion on this section.
<U+2192> EIS spectra show that both of photoanodes revealed an obviously semicircle of
Nyquist plot at the high frequencies and a Warburg type line at low frequencies under
illumination. The equivalent circuit modes applied to fit the experimental EIS data of
the as-prepared TiO2 NW and CQD/TiO2 composite electrode was shown in the inset
of figure 5c. The fitting results of all parameters of the equivalent circuit were listed
in Table 1. It should be noted that a larger charge transfer resistance (Rct) for TiO2
electrode (520.6 O) was observed as compared with that of the CQD/TiO2 electrode
(337.9 O). In addition, the Warburg resistance for CQD/TiO2 electrode (1273 O) is
apparent smaller than that of TiO2 electrode (4921 O). This illustrated that better
electronic and ionic conduction of CQD/TiO2 which is attributed to the decomposing
of toxic H2O2 on the photo anode.
Figure 5. (c) Nyquist plot of TiO2 NW and CQDs/TiO2 NW under AM 1.5G sunlight
illumination.
Table 1. EIS fitting parameters of as prepared TiO2 NW and CQDs/TiO2 NW.
8. Based on the transient photocurrent analysis, the photocurrent of CQD/TiO2 was
greater than that of TiO2 nanowires. I would suggest the authors to perform steady
state PL analysis to study the charge carrier trapping and recombination process.
<U+2192> Thank you for your suggestion. It will be an interested study for giving kinetic
information of CQDs/TiO2 NW. However, we lack the experimental instrument to
carry out the measurement. Instead of steady state PL analysis, EIS analysis was
respect to investigate charge/electron transport properties.
9. Since the manuscript title mentions the photooxidation of H2O, the evolution rate of
O2 should be studied and determined for both TiO2 nanowires and CQD/TiO2 samples.
This piece of information should be included in the revised manuscript.
<U+2192> The evolution rate of H2/O2 is one of data that we hope to measure in this research.
But, we lack equipment to carry out. Therefore, we are still looking for cooperation to
do it in this moment. We think the tittle of origin one is not appropriate due to we
can’t provide the information of photo oxidation of water. So, the tittle was revised
into “Green Synthesis of Carbon Quantum Dots Embedded onto Titanium Dioxide
Nanowires for Enhancing Photocurrent”.
