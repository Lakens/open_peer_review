Manuscript entitled “A novel Polyamine-type starch / GMA copolymer for adsorption of Pb(II),
Cu(II),Cd(II) and Cr(III) ions from aqueous solutions” submitted by Youning Chen, Wei
Zhao,Huan Wang, Xiaohua Meng, can be accepted for publishing in the Royal Society Open
Science Journal, after major revision.
In this study, a novel polyamine-type starch / GMA copolymer was prepared, detailed
characterized and tested as adsorbent for the removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous media.
The manuscript presents original results, which are relatively well organized and systematized.
Unfortunately some aspects need to be corrected before that the manuscript to be accepted for
publication.
Here is a list of my comments:
1. Page 1, Introduction: This section is too brief. Please provide a more detailed description of the
state of art in this field, such that the necessity of this study to be highlighted.
2. Page 3, line 3: What is the “initiator” used in these experiments.
3. Page 3, 2.5 Batch of adsorption experiment: “The adsorption performance of resin on…”. How
was obtained the resin particles after preparation of PAMS and which was their grain-size?
Please provide some details about these aspects.
4. Page 4, 3.1 Preparation of polyamin-type starch / GMA copolymer: This section should be
reformulated. Here some details related to the synthesis procedure of the resin, its separation and
particles grain size must be added.
5. Page 4, line 30: “As can be seen from SEM(Fig.3), the starch granules are spherical…”. How
were obtained these spherical granules? What is their grain-size?
6. Page 6, 3.3.2 Adsorption kinetics: Why for the kinetics modelling was used only the pseudo-
second order kinetics model? It is recommended that the modelling to be done for several kinetics
models in order to found the best model for the experimental results. For details, please see the

biomass, Open Chemistry, 14, (2016), 175-187.

In this manuscript, these authors reported their research on the synthesis and application of a
novel polyamine type starch / GMA copolymer for capturing heavy meta cations. Their work is
important to remove the contaminants from wastewater. I have the following suggestions: (1)
these authors need to improve their English of this manuscript (2) there are many minor errors
and format issues. I suggest these authors revise carefully their manuscript before publication (3)
The selective removable efficiencies for Cd(II) and Cr(III) are low. I suggest that these authors can
discuss the difference among these four elements they studied from the atomic structure.

amount of experimental work in this study. However, there are a lot of drawbacks in the text and
I recommend that the manuscript can be considered for publication after a major revision. Some
of these items are as below:
1.The part of Experimental Section and Results and discussion are too disorderly , the author

Dear editor,
Thank you and the reviewers for the comments concerning to our
manuscript (RSOS-180281) and giving us a chance to re-submit.
According to your and the reviewers’ suggestions, we have significantly
revised our manuscript. The detail responses to the reviewer’s comments
are as follows:
To reviewer 1
Q. 1. Page 1, Introduction: This section is too brief. Please provide a
more detailed description of the state of art in this field, such that the
necessity of this study to be highlighted.
Response: More detailed description of the state of art in this field has
been provided in the revised manuscript.Thank you for your advice.
Q. 2. Page 3, line 3: What is the “initiator” used in these experiments.
Response: The “initiator” used in these experiments is potassium
persulfate,which has been added in the revised manuscript.
Q. 3. Page 3, 2.5 Batch of adsorption experiment: “The adsorption
performance of resin on…”. How was obtained the resin particles after
preparation of PAMS and which was their grain-size? Please provide
some details about these aspects.
Response: We are sorry that there are many parts in the paper miss-used
the term "resin" instead of "cornstarch".We have checked the whole paper
carefully and made correction in the revised manuscript.
Q. 4. Page 4, 3.1 Preparation of polyamin-type starch / GMA copolymer:
This section should be reformulated. Here some details related to the
synthesis procedure of the resin, its separation and particles grain size
must be added.
Response: As mentioned above, we synthesize a copolymer rather than a
resin. We are very sorry for the mistakes caused by our carelessness.
Q. 5. Page 4, line 30: “As can be seen from SEM(Fig.3), the starch
granules are spherical…”. How were obtained these spherical granules?
What is their grain-size?
Response: This section describes scanning electron microscopy of raw
corn starch before modification.
Q. 6. Page 6, 3.3.2 Adsorption kinetics: Why for the kinetics modelling
was used only the pseudo-second order kinetics model? It is
recommended that the modelling to be done for several kinetics models in
order to found the best model for the experimental results. For details,
please see the paper: Optimization of process parameters for heavy metals
biosorption onto mustard waste biomass, Open Chemistry, 14, (2016),
175-187.
Response:Thank you for your advice. The results of our research have
shown that the mechanism of PAMS adsorbing heavy metal ions is
through the chelation of amine groups with heavy metal ions. The
pseudo-second model includes all processes of adsorption, such as
external liquid film diffusion, surface adsorption, and intra-particle
diffusion, which more accurately reflect the adsorption mechanism.So we
only used the pseudo-second order kinetics model to explain the kinetics
modelling.
Q. 7. Page 7, 3.3.3 Adsorption isotherm: The same observation as above.
Response: The experimental data of adsorption isotherm were analyzed
by Langmuir model and Freundlich model respectively.
Q. 8. Page 8, line 31: “The HSAB principle”. Please explain this
abbreviation.
Response: “The HSAB principle” means the theory of hard and soft
acids and bases, which has been explained in the revised manuscript.
To reviewer 2
Q. 1. these authors need to improve their English of this manuscript
Response: Thank you for your advice.We have carefully checked and
significantly revised our manuscript.
Q. 2. there are many minor errors and format issues. I suggest these
authors revise carefully their manuscript before publication.
Response: Some minor errors and format issues have been corrected in
the revised manuscript.
Q. 3. The selective removable efficiencies for Cd(II) and Cr(III) are low.
I suggest that these authors can discuss the difference among these four
elements they studied from the atomic structure.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. The reasons of selective
removable efficiencies for Cd(II) and Cr(III) have been explained in the
revised manuscript.
To reviewer 3
Q. 1. The part of Experimental Section and Results and discussion are too
disorderly , the author should reorder them.
Response: We have reorder the part of Experimental Section and Results
and discussion in the revised manuscript. Thank you very much.
Q. 2. The manuscript does not show a proper comparison of the results
with other studies, as also stated by the extremely low amount of citations
in the Results and discussion section. Please, revise this section.
Response: Table 2 shows the comparison of Cu(<U+2161>)<U+3001>Pb(<U+2161>)<U+3001>Cd(<U+2161>) and
Cr(<U+2162>)adsorption on PAMS with other adsorbents.Thank you for your
advice.
Q. 3. There are several typos in the manuscript that need to be fixed.
Response: Several typos have been fixed in the revised manuscript.
Thank you very much.
