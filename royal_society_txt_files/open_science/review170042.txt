This is a very interesting study and I found it compelling. It is one of those "of course, what a
great idea to look at this!" This is a straightforward demonstration of genetic influences on
aggression, with the added benefit of demonstrating pleiotropy, and with plausible proximate
(mechanistic) and ultimate (evolutionary) explanations.
The basic question is both interesting and simple: is allelic variation associated with variation in
larval foraging strategy also associated with adult aggression? Given the lines maintained by
Sokolowski, this can be addressed in a straightforward way. There are several reasons why this
may be true which the authors cover in the introduction. One possibility (almost the null) is that
all mutations are pleiotropic and therefore you expect universal pleiotropy. The other is that
pleiotropic effects are modular and predictable.
I think one prediction tested, discussed in part in the discussion but not really raised in the intro,
is that feeding and fighting strategies may well be expected to be co-adapted or modular. I
thought that you might expect rover dads to be more aggressive to create less dense patches for
their offspring. The reason this is interesting is that it cuts across life-history stages (larval and
adult) and generations (parents affecting offspring environment).
I think food deprivation may make more sense in discussion of how it increases the value of the
food patch they defend. This assumes that they are there to feed. However, if they are there to
influence larval environment (density) then making them hungry won't make them more
aggressive as it doesn't change the value (for the larva). So in my mind, this tested the function of
"for" in adult aggression - aggression for personal food or aggression for larval resource. It gets at
the modularity.
Finally, I am confused over the use of discriminant function analysis. I think you wanted
principle components analysis, which would create a linear combination of variables allowing
you to examine this multicomponent trait. DFA separates groups, PCA provides a new variable.
They are closely related (in fact, I couldn't tell but you may have done PCA and called it the
wrong thing) so I don't think anything would change. If you do PCA, your should report
loadings and eigenvalues for the variables and the PCs. You shouldn't really interpret PCs with
eigenvalues less than 1, but I bet PC1 is all positive (showing overall levels of agression) and PC2
is likely to be a mix with different behavior having opposite sign loadings, showing trade-offs in
behavior (or "aggressive strategy").
Minor comments:
line 41-42: In abstract (and throughout the manuscript) I think it is important to label foraging
(feeding) strategy as "larval" and aggression as "adult" behaviour. It is interesting to document
pleiotropic effects across insect life history stages in any case. Also (e.g.) line 79 and line 83 -
which of these are larval traits and which are adult?
Line 57: I think universal pleiotropy, which really is Wright's idea and not Fisher's, is that all
genes are pleiotropic not that all genes affect all traits.
Line 245 redundant with line 244.
Line 295 "was predicted to" rather than "might have"?
I think this is a really interesting paper. Well done.

Comment:
I think one prediction tested, discussed in part in the discussion but not
really raised in the intro, is that feeding and fighting strategies may well be expected
to be co-adapted or modular. I thought that you might expect rover dads to be more
aggressive to create less dense patches for their offspring. The reason this is

(parents affecting offspring environment). I think food deprivation may make more

as it doesn't change the value (for the larva). So in my mind, this tested the function
of "for" in adult aggression - aggression for personal food or aggression for larval
resource. It gets at the modularity.”
Response:
This is an interesting idea. We did not explicitly test the offspring larval
density/environment in this study, so we could not make the argument about the value of
aggressive behavior from the perspective of larval benefit. However, we do agree that
your idea contributes to our postulation about the coadaptation between feeding and
fighting strategies, which would be meaningful for future investigation.
Hence we made modifications in line 363-370: “Rover-‘offensive’ and sitter-
‘defensive’ aggressive strategies could potentially be maintained by negative frequency
dependent selection. When sitters are rare, the rover aggressive strategy is costly due to
harmful fights with abundant rovers opponents. However, when rovers are rare, adult
aggressive strategy can be beneficial, since it will dominate foraging and mating
opportunities among ‘defensive’ sitters. Such aggressive rover parents could guard
spacious larval food patches that favor rover larvae that tend to move around when
foraging. This negative frequency-dependent coadaptation of feeding and fighting
strategies might occur across life history stages and generations.”
Also, in line 373-375, we included the following: “Future study should test this
idea by tracking fitness, aggression, and foraging path length across life-history stages in
populations with varying rover-to-sitter frequencies.”
Comment:
“Finally, I am confused over the use of discriminant function analysis. I think you
wanted principle components analysis, which would create a linear combination of
variables allowing you to examine this multicomponent trait. DFA separates groups,
PCA provides a new variable. They are closely related (in fact, I couldn't tell but
you may have done PCA and called it the wrong thing) so I don't think anything
would change. If you do PCA, your should report loadings and eigenvalues for the
variables and the PCs. You shouldn't really interpret PCs with eigenvalues less than
1, but I bet PC1 is all positive (showing overall levels of agression) and PC2 is likely
to be a mix with different behavior having opposite sign loadings, showing trade-offs
in behavior (or "aggressive strategy").”
Response:
Thanks for pointing this out. In fact, we employed DFA instead of PCA. DFA is
similar to PCA (as you mentioned): it finds a linear combination of predictors to examine
this multiple component trait. However DFA searches for the linear combination of
variables such that it minimizes the within-group variance and maximizes the between-
group distance. Our goal was to reduce dimensionality among behavior variables in order
to get a collective representation of offensive behavior with the knowledge of the a priori
treatment groups. We thus found linear discriminant axis that pulls out between-treatment
variation in offensive behavior to test treatment effect with ANOVA. Your comments
made us realize that this method might result in false positives due to inflation of
between-group variance.
Therefore we changed the method and conducted PCA instead. As expected, this
change increased p-values, although it did not change the main conclusion of the study:
there is significant strain effect on the PC axes that effectively represent the variations in
offensive or defensive behavior. There is no food-deprivation effect on offensive
behaviors as a whole, although food-deprivation reduced intermediate aggressive
behaviors.
We made the corresponding change in the method (from line 202 on), result (from
line 220 on), and discussion (line 275, 298-302, 315, 320-322), as well as Figure 3. We
included eigenvalue and loading report in Table S1. Thank you again for your suggestion.
Minor comments:
“line 41-42: In abstract (and throughout the manuscript) I think it is important to
label foraging (feeding) strategy as "larval" and aggression as "adult" behaviour. It
is interesting to document pleiotropic effects across insect life history stages in any

“Also (e.g.) line 79 and line 83 - which of these are larval traits and which are
adult?”
Response:
In line 82, we added “larval” and “adult” and summarized the distinctive
phenotypes in adults, so that it reads as, “(reviewed in [14]), such as larval foraging path
length, adult behavioural and physiological responses to food-deprivation [15], learning
and memory, sleeping patterns, stress responses [16].”
“Line 57: I think universal pleiotropy, which really is Wright's idea and
not Fisher's, is that all genes are pleiotropic not that all genes affect
all traits.”
Response:
We double checked this and found that Fisher’s Geometric model (Fisher 1930)
described ‘universal pleiotropy’ as one locus mutation affecting all traits, which
explained how the fitness effect of a mutation vary as phenotypes become more
independent. Sewall Wright (1968) provided more evidence and expanded the idea.

behaviours”.
