The manuscript contains experimental results on the ultrasonically-assisted cementation of Pb(II)
on Zn. The reviewer thinks that this is an interesting work and the conclusion was well-
supported by data. However, it has misconceptions and some points should be better described:
The authors claim that in the leach “PbSO<sub>4</sub> is initially converted into soluble
PbCl<sub>2</sub>”, however, they use the redox potentials of Pb<sup>2+</sup> and
Zn<sup>2+</sup> aqua complex (Table 2) to explain the cementation process. Indeed, chloride-
metal complexes must form at the studied conditions. Please include the appropriate redox pair
couples. In addition, it is very important to show the reaction that describe the redox process
studied (i.e. cementation).
Please verify the following reference:

lead-silver residue. Multi. Utiliz. of Min. Res. 3, 15-20.
I tried finding above reference but it seems that it does not exist. This reference is important
because justify the investigation.
Throughout the paper, there are many sentences where English grammar need to fixed.

This work reported the ultrasonic augmented replacement of lead by zinc in lead leaching
solution, which is promising to reduce the energy consumption in hydrometallurgical industry.
The results are effective and convincing, and I recommend the publication after the minor
revision.
1. The error bars should be added to the figures.
2. The cost calculation on this new method should be provided that should be compared with
traditional process. I am concerning the cost for electricity during the ultrasonic would be large.
3. The applicability of the ultrasonic method into a large-scale industrial application should be
commented.
4. Is it possible that the high temperature during the ultrasonic would induce a dense toxic vapor
of metal? This should be discussed that may have a large impact on the environment.
5. A recent publication in this field should be cited: Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2017, 56, 9331.

Statement
The revised sentences and words are indicated in red in this revised manuscript, and the
statement of what has been done in this revised manuscript to each comment of the reviewers and
the editor is as follow:
Reviewer 1:
Question 1: The authors claim that in the leach “PbSO4 is initially converted into soluble PbCl2”,
however, they use the redox potentials of Pb2+ and Zn2+ aqua complex (Table 2) to explain the
cementation process. Indeed, chloride-metal complexes must form at the studied conditions.
Please include the appropriate redox pair couples. In addition, it is very important to show the
reaction that describe the redox process studied (i.e. cementation).
Response: I have revised the part and added chemical reactions of the process.
Question 2: Please verify the following reference:[12] Li T. 2012 Experimental research on
comprehensive recovery of lead, zinc and silver from a lead-silver residue. Multi. Utiliz. of Min.
Res. 3, 15-20.
Response: This is a Chinese document, and the author has added relevant information.
Reviewer 2:
Question 1: The error bars should be added to the figures.
Response: The single factor experimental data of this experiment is obtained by three experiments
to obtain the average value. After reviewing the original data, the maximum and minimum values
of all the data have been added to the original image.
Question 2: The cost calculation on this new method should be provided that should be compared
with traditional process. I am concerning the cost for electricity during the ultrasonic would be
large.
Response: I have added a discussion about energy consumption in 3.6.
Question 3: The applicability of the ultrasonic method into a large-scale industrial application
should be commented.
Response: Ultrasonic instruments can be used in large-scale by parallel to meet industrial needs.
Our team has invented a new technology for ultrasonic treatment of uranium-containing
wastewater with deep uranium removal, which solves the problem of conventional ultrasonic rod
corrosion and noise. This technology can handle different concentrations of uranium wastewater,
easy to operate in industry, safe and stable treatment line, high degree of automation, good
uranium removal efficiency, uranium content reduced to 4.8µg/L in 6min wastewater treatment,
far superior to uranium processing and fuel manufacturing facility radiation protection 50 µg/L as
specified in the Regulations (EJ1056-2005). As shown in the figure, the industrialization process
picture shows that the installed power of the equipment is 12kW, the purification time is shortened
by 60%, and the processing capacity is 15m3/h. The experimental process is basically the same as
the principle of the uranium removal process, and the replacement process is further industrialized.
Experimental principle is feasible. The author has supplemented the relevant commentes in
“introduction”.

Question 4: Is it possible that the high temperature during the ultrasonic would induce a dense
toxic vapor of metal? This should be discussed that may have a large impact on the environment.
Response: The high temperature generated by the ultrasonic wave is an instantaneous process,
and the temperature is quickly lowered by the surrounding solution. The high temperature
only causes the solution to instantaneously rise to about 40 °C. Although the temperature will
also volatilize, the volatilization is small, and the subsequent process can be performed by the
exhaust gas treatment device. So this problem can be effectively solved.
Question 5: A recent publication in this field should be cited: Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2017, 56,
9331.
Response: I have read this document, and quoted in [12]
