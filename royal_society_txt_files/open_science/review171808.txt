In this study, a method for the immuoassay of tau protein, a key marker for the Alzheimer's
disease was developed. The high quality of the study could be identified in the detection
principle of fluorescence quenching of labelled tau-protein on antibody modified GO, which
seems to lead high specific binding and low limit of detection. This advances the knowledge in
the detection method of Alzheimer's disease under molecular level and provided an alternative
approach to traditional ELISA. The work has been well planned and discussed, and consequently
deserves publication in RSOS. I recommend publication after minor modifications:
Below are some particular comments:
1 There are 6 isoforms of tau protein, why they chose tau441 as their target?
2 The scan rate of AFM image seems too high and caused noises.
3 Is there any particular reason why all assay optimization was performed using a 100 ng/mL
tau-FITC concentration?
4 Have the authors planed to test real human CSF samples?

Nicholas Geitner, Duke University. The authors have presented a work utilizing graphene oxide
(GO) as a quenching substrate, conjugated with targeted antibodies for the detection of tau
proteins. The work is performed well, and is likely of interest. I have a few concerns outlined
below.

1. My primary concern is the claim made about the utility of the technique in the proposed
clinical application. The LOD of the proposed method is approximately equal to the highest
reported concentration in the diseased state, which is already approximately 1 order of
magnitude higher than the reported threshold for the diseased state. It is therefore not only
possible, but very likely, that a disease state sample would go completely undetected by this
method. The authors must discuss this point more openly in the manuscript, and further propose
ways in which significant improvements may be made in further study. The reference technique,
SERS, has a much lower LOD, as noted in the present work. The limitations of SERS in terms of
method complexity may be overstated.
2. While the authors did perform competition studies, and the method performed adequately,
there was certainly a decrease in fluorescence intensity. The authors should comment on how this
further impacts the method LOD. Please also include a more complete statistical analysis of the
change in detection and intensity under competition. This is important, as any clinical sample
will be highly complex, mixed samples.

Appendix A
Point-by-Point Response
Dear editors and reviewers:
The manuscript RSOS-171808 had been carefully revised. We appreciate the detailed
and useful comments and suggestions from you and reviewers. The point-by-point
answers to the comments and suggestions were listed as below.
Reviewer #1:
1 There are 6 isoforms of tau protein, why they chose tau441 as their target?
Response and revision: According to literature mentioned below, there are 4 main
amino fragments that played the most important role in forming PHFs. Some of the
isoforms of tau protein only contains part of these amino fragments. The longest one
was Tau441 that contained all the disease relating structure, this was the reason that it
was chosen as the detecting target of our work.

neurodegenerative disorders. Brain. Res. Rev. 33, 95–130.doi:
/10.1016/S0165-0173(00)00019-9
2 The scan rate of AFM image seems too high and caused noises.
Response and revision: We appreciate the reviewer's kind suggestion. AFM tip were
checked before sample scanning using a standard sample. The noise in the image are
mostly due to instrument noise. We have previously tried samples with various GO
concentrations to determine the scanning rate. The main difference among them was
in the difficulties of locating a tiny area with GO flake for imaging, with dilute
sample more difficult to find a GO flake. However, we think the images made by
current scanning rate can still show the differences among the GO samples.
3 Is there any particular reason why all assay optimization was performed using a 100
ng/mL tau-FITC concentration?
Response and revision: The concentration is chosen based on two reasons. First we
intended to get a LOD around ng mL-1 or pg mL-1, if the concentration of tau-FITC
was too high, the signal of low concentration would be covered by the strong
fluorescence signal of tau-FITCs, the LOD would be raised. The other reason is if the
concentration of tau-FITC were too low, the fluorescence signal would be too low to
be detected. As we have mentioned in our manuscript, the quality of antibodies and
percentage of FITC labeling on tau may vary in different batches, even in the same
manufacturers. We believe the LOD would be much lower if we can get a
well-labeled antigen that could emit strong fluorescence signal even in pg mL-1 scale.
4 Have the authors planed to test real human CSF samples?
Response and revision: The reviewer's suggestion is what we are seeking now. We
had tried to contact with Huashang Hospital and Rengji Hospital to get real samples.
Due to the limit of ethics committee, we have not yet get real human cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) samples. CSF samples usually taken from patients' spine by using a long
needle stab into the neck, looks terrifying. That's why many patients rejected our
request for the sample collection. Without patients' direct permeation the ethics
committee would not allow us to use real samples. Due to our experiment aiming to
detect the Tau protein in human brain, this is the only way to get direct evidence.
According to literature (mentioned below), the concentration of tau protein in human
CSF is usually around 0~100 pg mL-1, when serious problems happen, the
concentration of CSF could raise to hundreds even thousands of pg mL-1( Momoko
Oka et al. reported for as high as 6.3 ng mL-1), reaching the LOD of our route (6.4 ng
mL-1). Since the concentration of Tau protein is so low in human CSF, the sample
would not be diluted and used directly without any pretreatment in commercial
ELISA practices.

Reviewer #2:
1. My primary concern is the claim made about the utility of the technique in the
proposed clinical application. The LOD of the proposed method is approximately
equal to the highest reported concentration in the diseased state, which is already
approximately 1 order of magnitude higher than the reported threshold for the
diseased state. It is therefore not only possible, but very likely, that a disease state
sample would go completely undetected by this method. The authors must discuss this
point more openly in the manuscript, and further propose ways in which significant
improvements may be made in further study. The reference technique, SERS, has a
much lower LOD, as noted in the present work. The limitations of SERS in terms of
method complexity may be overstated.
Response and revision: We appreciate the reviewer's kind suggestion. A more
openly discussion was added in the end of section 4.3, in which we committed the
lack that the reviewer had point out and proposed a possible improvement that may be
made in further study as follows:
"Since the molecular weight of tau protein is over 50 kDa, a concentration of
tau-FITC ranging 0-100 pg mL-1 (the base line level of tau concentration in human
CSF means there are about 2 fmol mL-1 FITC groups in the solution, which is too low
to be detected by fluorescence spectrophotometer. This is the main aspect that limits
the current LOD of our method, which is approximately equal to the highest reported
concentration of diseased state in human CSF. An amplifying system of fluorescence
is needed in this case in order to get a LOD ranging 0-100 pg mL-1, which will be
explored in our future studies."
The overstated comment of SERS were deleted, we comitted the advancement of
SERS in detecting biosamples.
2. While the authors did perform competition studies, and the method performed
adequately, there was certainly a decrease in fluorescence intensity. The authors
should comment on how this further impacts the method LOD. Please also include a
more complete statistical analysis of the change in detection and intensity under
competition. This is important, as any clinical sample will be highly complex, mixed
samples.
Response and revision: The reliability of our experiment data is based on the quality
of the antibodies and percentage of FITC labeling on tau protein, which varies in
different patches of product provided by even the same manufacturer. The expiration
date of protein samples is limited once they are unsealed. That means all the
experiments should be re-performed by new patches of antibodies and tau proteins in
order to provide unified fluorescence intensity in our article. Though the reviewer's
advice is highly reasonable, we could not perform all the data in 7 days. The
reviewer's brilliant comment will be taken in our further research of biosensors.
