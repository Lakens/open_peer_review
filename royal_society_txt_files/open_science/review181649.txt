This paper describes new bone-hemostatic materials and it is very valuable.
Please correct the following careless mistakes before acceptance.
1. The number in the section "3.1 Fabrication of porous composite sheet" is 2.1.
2. The number in the section "3.2 Evaluation" is 2.2.
3. In section 3.3, it is better to unify unit notation of 1,426%, 750 mass% and 521%.

This paper describes the fabrication of novel bone hemostasis sheet by using sugar-containing
hydroxyapatite and plant-derived polymer. As this paper contains the novel findings in the
bioceramics field, it values to publish in the Royal Society Open Science. However, I think that
the authors should revise the manuscript on the basis of the following comments.
1) What is “sugar-containing hydroxyapatite (s-HAp)”? Please explain it in detail. I think that
there are many kinds of sugars in this study.
2) Please replace “bio-absorbability (bio-absorbable)” with “bioresorbability (bioresorbable)”.
3) Page 2, line 16 from top:
The authors have used “human blood” in this work. The authors should make clear how did
3
obtain it.
4) Vertical axis in Figs. 7 and 11:
The authors should revise the “Mass lose / %” to “Weight loss / mass%”.
5) Page 5, line 7 from bottom:
The “SBF” is used in this work. The authors should explain the composition and preparation
method in the section of 2. Materials and Methods.

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
5
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.

March 25, 2019
Dear Sirs:
Thank you very much for the useful response to the following manuscript submitted to the
Royal Society Open Science (Special issue for ISIEM2018).
Auhors: Y. NOH, T. UMEDA, Y. MUSHA and K. ITATANI
Title: Fabrication of novel bone hemostasis sheet by using sugar-containing hydroxyapatite
and plant-derived polymer (Manuscript ID : RSOS-181649)
Please find our responses to the comments described below.
Sincerely,
Yeonjeong Noh
Department of Materials and Life Sciences
Sophia University
We have revised our manuscript on the basis of the reviewers’ comments as follows:
Response to Reviewer: 1
1-1. The number in the section "3.1 Fabrication of porous composite sheet" is 2.1.
Response: Thank you very much for pointing it out. We have revised the section number.
1-2. The number in the section "3.2 Evaluation" is 2.2.
Response: Thank you very much for pointing it out. We have revised the section number.
1-3. In section 3.3, it is better to unify unit notation of 1,426%, 750 mass% and 521%.
Response: In section 3.3, we unify unit notation of the amounts of SBF uptakes as follows:
The uptake amounts of SBF solution were: 1,426 mass% (80LBG-20GG/AG/s-HAp
composite sheet) > 750 mass% (80LBG-20GG/AG/POs-Ca composite sheet) > 521 mass%
(80LBG-20GG/AG composite sheet).
1.4. Also is there any correlation between the tensile strength of the composite and the
stanching performance? What is the optimal composition when considering the balance
between the two? Please comment if possible.
Response: The tensile strength of the sheet is related to the stanching performance, and is
needed for the handling to cover the bleeding sites and hemostasis. Relating to the
optimum composition for the balance between chemical composition and tensile strength,
we have to take into the considerations of the performances of (i) tensile strength for the
handling, (ii) large amount of blood uptakes and (iii) excellent bioresorbability. On the
basis of such consideration, we added the explanation in the text as follows:
“The tensile strength of the sheet is related to the stanching performance, and needed for
the handling to cover the bleeding sites and hemostasis. Relating to the optimum
composition for the balance between chemical composition and tensile strength, we have to
further take into the considerations of the performances of (i) tensile strength for the
handling, (ii) large amount of blood uptakes and (iii) excellent bioresorbability.”
Response to Reviewer: 2
2-1. What is “sugar-containing hydroxyapatite (s-HAp)”? Please explain it in detail. I
think that there are many kinds of sugars in this study.
Response: We added the details of sugar-containing hydroxyapatite (s-HAp) in
Introduction. “Such POs-Ca may be partially hydrolysed to form a POs-Ca-derived organic
compounds and hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2; HAp), i.e., sugar-containing HAp (s-HAp)
which helps assisting the bone regeneration [2,3].”
2. Please replace “bio-absorbability (bio-absorbable)” with “bioresorbability
(bioresorbable)”.
Response: We replace the word “bio-absorbability (bio-absorbable)” with “bioresorbability
(bioresorbable)”.
3. Page 2, line 16 from top: The authors have used “human blood” in this work. The authors
should make clear how did obtain it.
Response::We added the following sentence in the text as follows:
“The fresh human blood was collected from the adult male immediately before the test of
hemostasis.”
4. Vertical axis in Figs. 7 and 11: The authors should revise the “Mass loss / %” to “Weight
loss / mass%”.
Response: We revised the Figs. 7 and 11, on the basis of the reviewer’s suggestion.
5. Page 5, line 7 from bottom: The “SBF” is used in this work. The authors should explain
the composition and preparation method in the section of 2. Materials and Methods.
Response: We added the composition and preparation method of SBF solution in the
section 2.2 as follows:
“The specimen was immersed into the simulated body fluid (SBF) solution, and checked the
uptake amount of SBF solution. The standard SBF solution was prepared by dissolving
appropriate amounts of the chemicals in deionized water, i.e., NaCl, NaHCO3, KCl,
K2HPO4<U+0387>3H20, MgCl2<U+0387>6H20, CaCl2, HCl, Na2SO4 and (CH2OH)3CNH2), using 1 mol<U+0387>dm-3 of HCl.
The concentrations of inorganic ions in the SBF solution were almost the same as the human
blood plasma.”
