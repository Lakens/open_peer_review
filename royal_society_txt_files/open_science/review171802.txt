Associate Editor's comments (Dr Punidan Jeyasingh):
This manuscript reports substantial variation in size at maturity among management regions in
Alaska. The ms was reviewed by two experts, both of whom are enthusiastic about the work.
Nevertheless, both experts raised several important issues that need to be addressed. I believe the
comments were fair and highly constructive, and invite the authors to carefully address them in a
revision. In addition to a point-by-point consideration of reviewer comments, the authors should
make sure the data is readily accessible in Dryad (none of us were able to access it). With much
gratitude to the expert reviewers, I invite the authors to submit a revised version of this ms
carrying an important message.

his manuscript, the authors describe an investigation of the relationship between various external
ors on size at maturity of male golden king crabs. They estimate male size-at-maturity for regions of
Alaskan peninsula using the classical 50% maturity measure based on changes in morphometric
tionships. They search for correlations (but actually using linear regressions) between size-at-
urity and depth, water temperature, and harvest history. None of these factors were related to their
served variation in size-at-maturity among regions. They offer suggestions for further research to
lain their observed variation and discuss two management measures that could be adapted to deal with
inadvertent harvest of immature males in two of the regions.
m a broad perspective, this research is important because, although the authors did not find
tionships between the external factors and size-at-maturity, they searched such relationships.
nuscripts reporting nonsignificant results are just as important as those reporting significant results
ause they document research that may not need to be repeated or, at least, allows future researchers to
ritize similar research. To my knowledge, the statistical methods are sound, and the researchers offer
iple suggestions for future research and management options.
comments in the manuscript center principally on sentences that are difficult to understand, multiple
eats of the same equation in the Results, repeats of references to tables in the Discussion, and repeated
presented in more than one table. The manuscript needs to be “cleaned up” by clarifying confusing
ences and streamlined by removing all repeats throughout but could be published without a great deal
odification.
d not thoroughly check to see if the data were available. I did Google the Dryad Digital Repository
could get into that website.

27 Golden king crab (Lithodes aequispinus) supports a
28 commercial fishery in Southeast Alaska and legal
29 size is based on growth and maturity information
30 from other parts of their range. We found size at
31 maturity varied for crabs among seven management
32 areas in Southeast Alaska, where male maturity sizes
33 increased with latitude and differed from published
34 estimates across their North Pacific range, where size
35 at maturity decreased with increasing latitude. Depth,
36 temperature, and harvest history were not related
37 to variation observed in male maturity estimates.
38 Management implications from this research include
39 reducing legal size in some areas to maximize harvest
40 potential and increasing in others to allow male crab
41 the opportunity to reproduce before being harvested.
42 A more conservative strategy would incorporate the
43 largest maturity size, increasing the legal size which
44 would have a negative to the commercial fishery, but
45 allow male crab the opportunity to reproduce before
46 being harvested. This study shows the importance of
47 understanding how life history characteristics change
48 over space and the challenge incorporating spatial
49 variability for improved fisheries management.

8 Minimum size limits are an established fisheries management tool that has been utilized to

help ensure long term sustainability of fishery stocks. A minimum size limit for legal size
10 allows for individuals to reproduce and contribute to future populations and prevent recruitment
11 overfishing [1,2]. Legal size is used in male-only crab fisheries in the North Pacific and is primarily
12 based on size at maturity while incorporating other life history parameters such as growth and
13 molting frequency. Sex and size-selectivity in crab fisheries allows for long-term reproductive
14 viability and sustainability by allowing a proportion of males from a stock to be harvested while
15 females are left to continually reproduce [1,3]. Size at maturity in males for some crab species can
16 be estimated by using the breaking point in the ratio between chela height (CH) and carapace
17 length (CL), also known as size at 50% morphometric maturity (SMM), because claw size in
..............................................................
18 males is one of the secondary sexual characteristics that changes at the onset of morphological
19 maturity [4–7]. While in females, size at 50% maturity (SAM) is estimated by examining the
20 presence of embryos or embryo cases attached to the pleopods [8,9]. Examining size at maturity in
21 both males and females may inform how size at maturity may be influenced by fisheries between
22 a harvested and unharvested proportion of a stock within the same species.
23 Size at maturity can vary within or among geographic areas, leading to challenges in fisheries
24 management. Spatial variability in size at maturity has been observed in high latitude crab
25 species such as, Tanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi) [10], snow crab (C. opilio) [11], red king crab
26 (Paralithodes camtschaticus) [12], blue king crab (P. platypus) [13], and golden king crab (Lithodes
27 aequispinus) [9,14]. Size at maturity estimates were generally found to decrease with latitude,
28 except for Tanner crab, which varied by longitude [10,15]. Interestingly, the latitudinal pattern
29 observed of decreased size at maturity is contrary to Bergmann’s rule, which states that animals
30 living in lower latitudes and warmer climates are generally smaller than animals living in higher
31 latitudes and colder climates [16]. Spatial variation in size at maturity for crab species in the North
32 Pacific has been hypothesized to be dependent upon 1) temperature, which is associated with
33 metabolic rate, growth rate, molt timing, and molt increment, 2) size-selective historical fishing
34 pressure [10,15,17,18], and 3) genetic variation [11].
35 Variation in size at maturity can be influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors, such
36 as temperature, food availability, and size-selective fishing pressure. Temperature and food
37 availability are key environmental variables that can influence size at maturity. In ectotherms,
38 cooler temperatures retard growth and delay maturity, causing individuals to mature at a larger
39 size compared to species in warmer environments [19]. Growth rate and size at maturity are
40 also influenced by food availability, in which increased food availability can result in earlier
41 maturation due to increased amounts of reserved energy [20]. Whether temperature, food
42 availability, or their interaction is most influential on size at maturity continues to be debated
43 among scientists and is commonly known as the Berrigan-Charnov puzzle [20,21]. Size selectivity
44 of fishing gear may remove faster maturing and growing individuals, while allowing late
45 maturing and slow growing individuals to avoid harvest and reproduce, causing an overall
46 decline in size and age at maturity [22,23]. If growth rate is heritable, this resultant evolutionary
47 effect can decrease population growth, greatly impeding recovery in an overfished population
48 and lead to fishery closures [24]. Evidence of this effect exists for many species, including Pacific
49 salmon (Salmonidae) [23] and gastropods in Southern California [25]. However, the effects of
50 fishing pressure on SAM have not been examined in many commercially important species,
51 especially crab.
52 Golden king crab are widely distributed across the North Pacific and largely lack biological
53 information to help inform fisheries management. Golden king crab life history attributes include:
54 morphometrically mature at approximately 8 years, 20 month reproductive cycle, lecithotrophic
55 larvae that remain at depth, mature females molt approximately every 1.5 to 2 yr, and mature
56 males molt every 10 to 33 mo [26–29]. Slow growth and late maturation make golden king crab
57 vulnerable to overfishing. Golden king crab inhabit a very inaccessible environment distributed

across the North Pacific at depths ranging from 100 to 1,000 m and thus lack much of the basic

biological information to inform fisheries management [8,9,30].

eastern Bering Sea, and Southeast Alaska that emerged after the collapse of the red and blue
10
king crab commercial fisheries in Alaska in the early 1980s [8,9,31,32]. The commercial fishery
11
further developed in Southeast Alaska with harvest peaking twice in 1987 (461 t) and 2010 (332
12
t) and has undergone a period of collapse in the 1990s and is currently in a collapsed state with a
13
harvest of 107 t in 2014 [29]. Management of the Southeast Alaska golden king crab commercial
14
fishery is conducted based on a 3-S (sex, size, and season) management system and has further
15
developed by limiting the number participants, establishing a catch quota per management area,
16
and allowing management to close areas if there are stock health concerns. The fishing season
17
..............................................................
typically occurs from February to May or until the catch quota is obtained [29]. The current
18 management areas for the Southeast Alaska golden king crab fishery consist of Lynn Canal, Icy
19 Strait, North Stephens Passage, Frederick Sound, Mid-Chatham Strait, Lower Chatham Strait, and
20 Clarence Strait (Fig 1). Male-only harvest is allowed using a minimum legal size of 177.8 mm/7.0
21 in carapace width (CW), intended to allow crab to mature and reproduce at least once before
22 being harvested.
23 The historical process on setting the minimum harvest size limit in Southeast Alaska is not
24 very clear; however, information on a variety sources was considered. The minimum size limit
25 for male golden king crab was originally based on growth and maturity information for red king
26 crab from the Gulf of Alaska, which is a different species from a different location [33,34], due
27 to the lack of biological information on golden king crab. This size limit was later justified using
28 biological data on golden king crab life history [29] as it became available, which consisted of
29 growth information primarily from Frederick Sound and Lynn Canal in Southeast Alaska using
30 a tagging study [31] and SMM estimates most likely from the southeastern Bering Sea (130.0 mm
31 CL) [9]. While SAM and growth are the main components of legal size, spine lengths on a crab’s
32 carapace play a critical role in determining if a specimen is legal for harvest and also requires
33 a closer look. Spine length is included in harvest size limits, and thus variability in spine length
34 could influence the impact of size limits on the fished population. Many invertebrate species, such
35 as the red sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) [35], mud crab (Rhithropanopeus harrisii) [36],
36 and blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) [37], have increased survival attributed to spine morphology
37 that reduces predation risk [38]. Potential predators avoid prey with longer spines due to their
38 unpalatability, and spine length is plastic and can respond to predation pressure [35,37,38]. How
39 spine length varies in golden king crab remains unknown.
40 In Southeast Alaska, golden king crab size at maturity has not been estimated and information
41 on basic life history parameters specific to Southeast Alaska is needed to ensure that fisheries
42 management reflects the regionally specific biology. In this study, we estimate spatial variability
43 in SMM and SAM, the influence of temperature, depth and harvest on spatial variation in SMM
44 estimates, and mean spine contribution to legal sized males with the overall goal to better inform
45 fisheries management to sustainably manage the golden king crab fishery.

8 Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) observers measured golden king crab during
9
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
the commercial fishery (February–May) in Southeast Alaska. Male golden king crab CL and CH
10 were measured to the nearest 1 mm during 2007–2014 (n=9,786). Female CL was measured and
11 pleopods inspected to determine maturity during 1998–2015 (n=14,242). Crabs that were visually
12 infected with Briarosaccus auratum (n=448) were excluded from the analysis, because they are
13 known to suppress growth, potentially hindering maturity [39–41]. Observer coverage included
14 at least one trip in one of the seven management areas in Southeast Alaska each year (Fig 1). Male
15 SMM was estimated by fitting a piece-wise linear regression model to the relationship between CL
16 (independent variable) and CH (dependent variable) by least squares. Male SMM was estimated
17 as the breakpoint of the following model:
..............................................................
18
19
20 y = ß0 + ß1 (X) + ß2 (X - C)+ +  (2.1)
21 where y=CH (mm), ß0 , ß1 , and ß2 are estimated regression parameters, X=CL (mm), C represents
22 the breakpoint, the term (X - C)+ takes the value of zero if the argument is negative and the
23 value of the argument if it is positive, and  is the error term. Parameters were estimated using the
24 statistical program R 3.1.3 [42] and the extension package SiZer: Significant Zero Crossings [43]
25 and 95% confidence intervals for the breakpoint and the slope parameters were obtained using
26 a bootstrap procedure. One thousand bootstrap samples were taken by resampling the raw data
27 points and refitting the piece-wise linear regression model to calculate 50% SMM for each of
28 the 1,000 estimates [44]. We compared SMM among management areas using the Fisher-Behrens
29 statistic:
30
31
32 |Cˆ - Cˆ2 |
z = q1 (2.2)
33 s21 + s22
34
35 where C1 and C2 are size at morphometric maturity estimates from different areas and s1 and
36 s2 are standard errors associated with these estimates. The Fisher-Behrens statistic was then
37 compared to the critical value of a normal distribution, z1- 1-a , adjusted for multiple tests using a
2
38 Bonferroni correction, which replaces a with a n , where a=0.05 and n=total number of hypotheses
39 to be tested (21) [45,46].
40 Female SAM was determined based on the presence of embryos or empty embryo cases
41 attached to the pleopods [8,9]. Maturity was estimated by fitting a logistic regression model to
42 the proportion of mature females at a given CL (mm):
43
44 1
45 P= (2.3)
1 + e-a(CL-b)
46
47 where P is the predicted proportion of mature females at a given CL (mm), and a and b are
48 estimated parameters. Parameter a represents the shape of the curve and parameter b is the SAM
49 CL (mm). The negative log-likelihood was estimated at each maturity proportion as:
50
51
- loge CL = -[M loge (P + 0.0001) + I loge (P + 0.0001)] (2.4)
52
53 where M =number of mature crab and I = number of immature crab at a given CL (mm). The
54 Excel SOLVER feature was used to find the values of parameters a and b that minimize the sum
55 of the negative log-likelihoods [47]. The fitted logistic model was then evaluated to determine the
56 CL that corresponds with 50% SAM [4], and 95% confidence intervals were determined using
57 bootstrapping with 1,000 replicates, implemented in the statistical program R 3.1.3 [4,42]. To
58 determine if SAM differed significantly among areas, a log-likelihood ratio test was used [46,48]:

where CLR is the reduced model with a SAM estimate from a given area and CLF is the full
10

11
Male SMM estimates and female SAM estimates from their geographic distribution from
12
published literature (Japan, eastern Russia, eastern Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and British
13
Columbia, Canada) as well as from the seven management areas in Southeast Alaska were
14
analyzed together and separately (only Southeast Alaska management areas) as a function of
15
latitude using a linear regression model:
16
17
..............................................................
18 y = ß0 + ß1 x +  (2.6)
19
20 where y=size at maturity estimates (male SMM or female SAM), ß0 and ß1 are estimated
21 regression parameters, x=mean latitude (degrees), and =error terms. Size at morphometric
22 maturity for male golden king crab in Prince William Sound, Alaska [49] was estimated using
23 a method that differed from those used in the rest of the literature and, because of this, were
24 excluded from this analysis.
25 Because removals of males in the fishery could result in variation in SMM estimates, we
26 examined variation in commercial harvest using ADF&G landing data from management areas to
27 determine if fishery harvest was related to variation observed in SMM estimates. Effects of fishery
28 harvest on male SMM estimates from Southeast Alaska were analyzed using linear regression
29 models by comparing the total harvest for each management area from two different time periods,
30 1972–2014 or 2005–2014, to maturity estimates:
31
32 y = ß0 + ß1 x +  (2.7)
33
34 where y=size at maturity estimates for male crab from seven management areas, ß0 and ß1
35 are estimated regression parameters, x=total harvest (t) from 1972–2014 or 2005–2014 for each
36 management area, and =error terms.
37
38 (b) Environmental Variability
39
40 Depth and temperature, which may vary across management areas and influence variation in
41 SMM for golden king crab, were measured from February to May during commercial fishing
42 seasons. ADF&G observers recorded crab pot depth from 1998–2014 from fishing vessel sonar
43 measurements, which ranged from 40–750 m (n=6,804) (Table 1).

31
32 To determine if temperature varied significantly among management areas, mean
33 temperatures determined for each management area were compared using standard deviations.
34 Pot depth and temperature were then used to determine if they may be related to SMM for male
35 golden king crab for all management areas by fitting a linear regression model for depth and
36 temperature using month as a covariate for the temperature analysis:
37
38
39 y = ß0 + ß1 x +  (2.9)
40 where y=size at morphometric maturity, ß0 and ß1 are estimated regression parameters, x=mean
41 depth, and =error terms and,
42
43
44 y = ß0 + ß1 X1 + ß2 X2 +  (2.10)
45 where y=size at morphometric maturity, ß0 , ß1 , and ß2 are estimated regression parameters,
46 x1 =mean temperature, x2 =month and =error terms.
47 Because temperature data were opportunistically collected by fishery observers and varied
48 by which months and years were sampled across management areas, we examined seasonal
49 and yearly variation in near-bottom temperature at 250 m, a depth representative of golden
50 king crab habitat, using a long-term time series from a mooring station in the northern Gulf of
51 Alaska. The temperature data were retrieved from a publicly available database maintained by
52 the University of Alaska Fairbanks School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences (http://www.ims.
53 uaf.edu/gak1/). The Gulf of Alaska (GAK1) mooring station is located adjacent to the coast
54 near Seward (59<U+25E6> 50.7’ N, 149<U+25E6> 28.0’W) at a depth of 250 m. Temperature measurements at 250 m,
55 recorded every quarter hour (n=200,299), were averaged by month during 2008-2013 (January–
56 December, n=72). Mean monthly temperatures from GAK1 (n=72) were evaluated by fitting a
57 one-way repeated measures ANOVA and compared using Tukey’s HSD pairwise comparisons
58 (a<0.05). Then monthly mean temperatures for GAK1 and Southeast Alaska (GAK1: February

using Tukey’s HSD pairwise comparisons (a<0.05). These analyses were used to determine 1)

consistency in temperature at depth across months and 2) whether opportunistic intermittent
10
sampling by fisheries observers (February–May from 2008–2014) are representative of those
11
measured consistently in the northern Gulf of Alaska.
12
13
14 (c) Crab Size and Spine Contribution
15 We investigated the CW, CL and spine contribution to size of legal male golden king crab to
16 determine variation among and to develop growth equations for management areas of Southeast
17
..............................................................
Alaska. ADF&G observers and port samplers sampled legal sized males during 2013–2014
18 (n=1,592) and measured CL and CW to the nearest 1 mm with and without spines at the widest
19 point of the carapace. Additionally, port samplers measured CL of legal size males (n=93,075)
20 during 1972–2014 to quantify the size of crab commercially harvested. Spine contribution was
21 calculated as the difference in CW with and without spines and includes contribution of spines
22 on both sides of the carapace. Estimates of spine contribution, CW and CL were compared across
23 management areas using an ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD pairwise comparisons (a<0.05) using JMP
24 11.0.0 statistical software [50].
25
26
27 (d) Legal Size
28 To reassess the current legal size in each of the management areas in Southeast Alaska, estimates
29 of mean spine contribution, SMM, and an area wide growth increment (16.3 mm CL, SD=3.0,
30 n=45 from Lynn Canal, Icy Strait, and Frederick Sound) [31] were used to generate a spatially-
31 specific legal size. These metrics were then used in conjunction with CL and CW measurements
32 to develop a CL-CW model in all 7 management areas to determine if golden king crab males
33 have at least one opportunity to reproduce before being harvested under the current fishery legal
34 size of 177.8 mm/7.0 in CW. The relationship between CL and CW was used in order to convert
35 CL measurements (morphometric maturity and molt increment) into CW because the commercial
36 fishery uses CW for legal size determinations:
37
38
39 CW = mCL - b (2.11)
40 where CW is given carapace width (mm), CL is a given carapace length (mm), m is the slope,
41 and b is the CW intercept. Equation 2.11 was then modified to incorporate SMM estimates, a molt
42 increment, and mean spine contribution:
43
44
45 CW = (m(SM Ma + molt increment) - b) + mean spine contributiona (2.12)
46 where SM M is the size at 50% morphometric maturity estimate, a is the area of interest, and b is
47 the CW intercept from Eq. 2.11, and mean spine contribution.
48
49
50 3. Results
51
52 (a) Size at Maturity
53 Male SMM estimates varied significantly across management areas, with the largest difference of
54 40.1 mm occurring between Icy Strait and Lower Chatham Strait. Icy Strait crabs had the largest
55 SMM estimate (158.0 mm CL), followed by Lynn Canal (147.3 mm CL), Clarence Strait (138.5 mm
56 CL), Frederick Sound (137.6 mm CL), North Stephens Passage (131.9 mm CL), Mid-Chatham
57 Strait (127.3 mm CL), and Lower Chatham Strait (117.9 mm CL) (Fig 2 and Table 3). Fisher-
58 Behrens statistics showed significant differences among many of the management areas (Fig

Maturity estimates of golden king crab decreased with increasing latitude over their

geographic distribution when excluding Southeast Alaska, for both males (F =16.75, p-
8
value=0.003, R2 =0.677) and females (F =48.22, p-value=0.0001, R2 =0.858) (Fig 3). Male SMM
9
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
in Southeast Alaska was not related to latitude when the most southerly area, Clarence Strait,
10
was included in the analysis (F =3.092, p-value=0.139, R2 =0.382) (Fig 4A). However, when
11
Clarence Strait was removed from the analysis, SMM increased with increasing latitude (F =10.94,
12
p-value=0.0297, R2 =0.665) (Fig 4B). For females latitude was not related to SAM (F =1.64, p-
13
value=0.256, R2 =0.247) (Fig 4A), even when crabs from Clarence Strait were removed from the
14
analysis (F =0.310, p-value=0.586, R2 =0.080) (Fig 4B). Interestingly, for Clarence Strait both male

SMM and female SAM estimates did not fit the increasing latitudinal cline observed in Southeast
16
Alaska indicating that Clarence Strait is a uniquely different area among the other managements

areas.
18 Fishery harvest varied among management areas but was not related to variation in SMM.
19 Total harvest during 1972–2014 was highest in Frederick Sound (3,671 t) and Lynn Canal (2,054
20 t), followed by Mid-Chatham Strait (1,499 t), Icy Strait (741 t), North Stephens Passage (306 t),
21 Lower Chatham Strait (304 t), and Clarence Strait (161 t). Fishery harvest, using total harvest from
22 the commercial fishery from 1972–2014, did not explain the variation observed in male golden
23 king crab SMM estimates for Southeast Alaska (F =0.1624, p-value=0.704, R2 =0.032). Additionally,
24 harvest from a more recent time period (2005–2014) did not explain the variation observed in
25 SMM estimates (F =0.205, p-value=0.670, R2 =0.039). Total harvest from 2005–2014 was highest
26 in Frederick Sound (1,131 t) and Lynn Canal (639 t) followed by Mid-Chatham Strait (427 t), Icy
27 Strait (211 t), North Stephens Passage (79 t), Clarence Strait (76 t), and Lower Chatham Strait (65
28 t).

31 Figure 3. Latitudinal variation in SMM and SAM for golden king crab from the published literature. Male maturity estimates
32 were determined using SMM and female maturity estimates were determined using SAM. Maturity estimates from the
33 published literature include: Japan (J) [8,51]; the southern, central, and northern Kuril Islands (SK, CK, and NK) [14] and
34 eastern Sakhalin Island (ES) [52], Russia; Seguam Pass (SP), Bowers Ridge (BR) [32]; south, central, and northeastern
35 Bering Sea (SEBS, CEBS, and NEBS) with 95% confidence intervals for males [10] Alaska; and Canada (BC) with 95%
36 confidence intervals [8]. Note that the Japanese estimated SAM for females reflects the estimated size at which 60% of
37 the females were found to be mature [8,51]. A linear regression line for male (solid) and female (dotted) golden king crab
38 is plotted to represent the strength in the latitudinal cline across Japan, eastern Russia, the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands,
39 and Canada. Both male (R2 =0.677) and female (R2 =0.858) golden king crab exhibited strong patterns in latitudinal
40 variation with SMM and SAM estimates decreasing as latitude increased.

53 The mean depth of pots sampled during the commercial fishery varied significantly among
54 management areas with five groupings (Table 4). Pots sampled in Mid-Chatham Strait and Lower
55 Chatham Strait were the deepest, with mean depths below 500 m, followed by Lynn Canal and
56 Clarence Strait with depths approximately 350 m. Mean depth of pots in Frederick Sound, Icy

21 The mean monthly bottom temperature sampled during the golden king crab commercial
22 fishery (February–May) varied within a range of 5.1–6.0<U+25E6> C among management areas and the 250
23 m depth GAK1 mooring station (Fig 5). Monthly mean temperatures for GAK1 throughout the
24 year ranged from a low of 5.3<U+25E6> C in May, June, August, and September to a high of 6.1<U+25E6> C in January
25 (Fig 6). When GAK1 and pooled Southeast Alaska temperatures were analyzed for monthly
26 variation between locations during the timing of the golden king crab commercial fishery, there
27 was a significant interaction between location and month (F =5.28, p-value=0.006). During the
28 month of February, temperatures measured in Southeast Alaska were significantly cooler than
29 at GAK1 (p-value=0.0013), but these differences did not occur in March, April, or May (Fig 6).
30 Additionally, SMM was not related to variation in depth across management areas (F =1.778,
31 p-value=0.240, and R2 =0.262) and did not relate to variation in mean monthly temperature by
32 management area from Southeast Alaska (F =0.492, p-value=0.5, R2 =0.0394) and month was a
33 non-significant covariate (p-value=0.979).

54
Frederick Sound (8.9 mm), and Icy Strait (8.9 mm). Clarence Strait mean spine contribution to
55
legal size was larger than Lynn Canal, Mid-Chatham Strait, Frederick Sound and Icy Strait (Table

Using the CL–CW relationship for each area and incorporating SMM estimates, growth increment
23
from Southeast Alaska (16.3 mm CL), and mean spine contribution to legal size, and assuming
24
that reproduction occurs after molting, we calculated that crab are capable of reproducing at
25
least once before being harvested and reaching the current legal size (177.8 mm CW) in five
26
out of seven areas (Table 6). Projected area-specific legal size estimates (CW) for Clarence Strait
27
(177.6 mm), Frederick Sound (173.4 mm), North Stephens Passage (168.8 mm), Mid-Chatham
28
Strait (163.2 mm), and Lower Chatham Strait (159.8 mm) remain under the current legal size.
29
Projected area-specific legal size estimates (CW) for Icy Strait (196.5 mm) and Lynn Canal (186.0
30
mm) substantially exceeded current legal size (177.8 mm). Area-specific CL-CW models, which
31
were used to convert SMM in CL to CW, were significant for all areas (p-value<0.001). North
32
Stephens Passage had the strongest relationship between CL and CW (n= 152, F =1,803, R2 =0.92),

allow crabs to reproduce at least once and thus prevent overharvest. The explanation for spatial
7 13
variation in SMM estimates of male golden king crab in Southeast Alaska is not immediately
8
apparent, as SMM was unrelated to depth, temperature, harvest pressure, and spine length.
9
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
Estimates of male SMM generally increased with latitude within Southeast Alaska, but the
10
relationship was not significant, while estimates of female SAM did not vary with latitude. This
11
intriguing pattern, which is the opposite of what is observed over a broad geographic area (Fig
12
2) and Bergmann’s rule, may result from the glacial fjord system and unique habitats of golden
13
king crab in Southeast Alaska. Female SAM in Southeast Alaska was smaller than male SMM,
14
and the differences among management areas varied less for females than for males. The small
15
differences across management areas for females suggest that female golden king crab become
16
sexually mature over a narrow size range. Interestingly, Aleutian Islands female golden king crab
17
..............................................................
populations sampled in 1981–1984 have a smaller SAM range (106.4 mm–110.7 mm) [9,32] than
18 those in Southeast Alaska (100.4 mm–119.0 mm).
19 Estimates of male golden king crab location-specific mature CWs which incorporated SMM,
20 growth increment, and mean spine contribution to legal size in Southeast Alaska revealed that
21 the current legal size of 177.8 mm/7.0 in CW may not allow crab to reproduce at least once before
22 being harvested in two of the seven management areas: Icy Strait and Lynn Canal. This indicates
23 that the current legal size for the golden king crab commercial fishery in Southeast Alaska could
24 be improved to incorporate area-specific maturity; however a revised management approach is
25 not clear. Adoption of area-specific legal sizes for each management area would be ideal as it
26 would maximize harvest for each area, but this is not practical because fishermen harvest from
27 multiple management areas at the same time, thus it would be difficult to enforce. The most
28 conservative option would be to increase the legal size throughout the region to exceed the largest
29 area specific legal size CW (Icy Strait (196.5 mm/7.7 in CW)), so that no single area is potentially
30 overexploited. If the legal size was increased to 196.5 mm/7.7 in CW, the potential harvest loss
31 based on historical harvest from 1972–2014 would differ across management areas, with greatest
32 harvest loss in Lower Chatham (84%) and least in Lynn Canal (38%) (Table 7). To alleviate the high
33 potential loss of harvest in Lower Chatham Strait, which has the smallest SMM estimate (117.9
34 mm CL) and area-specific legal size (159.8 mm/6.3 in CW), an alternative management strategy
35 could be applied by opening this area to a reduced legal size when all other management areas are
36 closed. We did not calculate long-term harvest loss owing to a reduction in reproductive output
37 associated with harvest of males before they had a chance to reproduce. This issue and the recent
38 decline in harvest and large size at morphometric maturities, especially in Icy Strait and Lynn
39 Canal, are worthy of future study.
40 Male SMM estimates in Southeast Alaska varied spatially among contiguous waterways,
41 including Frederick Sound, Mid-Chatham Strait, and Lower Chatham Strait. This variation may
42 indicate that crabs may segregate by size or could be spatially separate populations. In contrast,
43 areas that were spatially separated had crabs with similar SMM; crabs from Clarence Strait
44 were surprisingly not significantly different in SMM from Frederick Sound and North Stephens
45 Passage. Low power resulting from a small sample size and lack of immature crabs may explain
46 this result for North Stephens Passage and more samples may reveal a difference. We initially
47 planned to examine SMM estimates over time for each management area to reveal temporal
48 variability and elucidate mechanisms for variability in size at morphometric maturity. However,
49 variable sampling effort across management areas and years by fishery observers and declines
50 in population levels over the past few years resulted in too small sample sizes when data were
51 subdivided by years.
52 We could not detect an influence of depth or temperature on SMM for male golden
53 king crab. Mean depth varied among management areas and ranged from 246 m to 514 m.
54 Mean temperature measured on crab pots and at a long term mooring at 250 m depth was
55 relatively constant and ranged only over 1<U+25E6> C, from 5.1 <U+25E6> C to 6.1 <U+25E6> C. Significant differences in
56 mean temperature occurred in February between Southeast Alaska and the mooring at GAK1,
57 suggesting that winter temperatures may be colder in the protected inner waters of Southeast

29 Alaska than offshore in the Gulf of Alaska. Bottom temperature data were only available at the
30 time of the fishery in Southeast Alaska and seasonal variation in temperature at depth could be
31 further investigated. It was surprising that temperature was not related to the variability in male
32 SMM estimates observed for golden king crab in Southeast Alaska, but this result may arise from
33 the lack of variation in temperature at deep depths.
34 We found no relationship between total harvest of golden king crab over two different time
35 periods, from 1972–2014 or 2005–2014, and SMM estimates across management areas. We were
36 not able to resolve shorter-term patterns, due to small sample sizes of crabs in any given year. The
37 relationship between maturity and harvest pressure could be further investigated to determine if
38 temporal variability in harvest pressure may have an effect on size at maturity for golden king
39 crab and to better inform current size at maturity estimates. The influence of harvest pressure
40 on SMM can have important implications for fisheries management [7,23]. Removing larger
41 and more reproductively viable individuals can result in decreased size at maturity, which then
42 requires an adjustment to harvest strategy to maintain harvest rates and spawning biomass [7].
43 Reductions in size at maturity can exacerbate population declines, leading to a collapse if fisheries
44 management does not adapt by adjusting minimum legal size and gear selectivity in order
45 maintain fishery sustainability [24]. The sustainability of the Southeast Alaska golden king crab
46 fishery is questionable, as it has collapsed multiple times, thus monitoring SMM to detect possible
47 temporal changes could potentially inform of future sustainability concerns. If a larger legal size
48 were to be adopted, future studies could investigate if spatial variation in SMM changes over time
49 and across management areas.
50 A similar study was conducted in Southeast Alaska looking at influences of latitude,
51 temperature, depth, and harvest pressure on size at maturity estimates for male and female
52 Tanner crab [53]. Variability in maturity estimates was observed across Southeast Alaska, but did
53 not follow a latitudinal cline as we observed for populations of golden king crab. Interestingly,
54 neither temperature, depth, or harvest pressure explained the variability observed in Tanner crab
55 maturity estimates, similar to our results here. Siddon and Bednarski [51] attributed the lack of
56 a relationship between these factors and maturity estimates to temperature influences on growth
57 and the limiting effects of food availability. As temperature increases, molting frequency and
58 overall growth increase in the lab for Tanner crab and blue crab [54,55]. When food availability

is limited, less energy is available for growth and reproduction, which can cause delays in size at
7 15
maturation [56,57]. Temperature in golden king crab habitat at depth varied by location, but by
8
less than 1.0 <U+25E6> C, indicating temperature effects on growth and food availability may be minimal.
9
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
However, competition for prey resources and predator influences on golden king crab could
10
cause variation in food availability and potentially spatial variation in size at maturity, but this
11
hypothesis needs to be further investigated.
12
Predation may be influential in determining size at maturity through direct and indirect effects.
13
High levels of predation can increase the rate of growth and speed at which a prey species
14
reaches maturity in order to contribute to future populations with the trade-off of having a
15
higher mortality rate [58,59]. On the other hand predators can indirectly influence prey foraging
16
behavior and through reduced foraging opportunity limit food availability, with the result of
17
..............................................................
reduced growth rate and ultimately delaying the onset of maturity [60]. A variety of predators
18 consume golden king crab, such as Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), Pacific cod (Gadus
19 macrocephalus), and sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), based on anecdotal reports from the fishing
20 community and observations of stomach contents in processed fish (L. Norheim, fisherman,
21 Petersburg, AK, personal communication, 2015). Published information on groundfish predation
22 rates on king crab is limited; however, an analysis of stomach contents conducted by Livingston
23 (1989) from 1981–1984 looked at trends in Pacific cod predation on three commercially important
24 crab species in the eastern Bering Sea: red king crab, snow crab, and Tanner crab. Female red king
25 crab only made up a small portion of the Pacific cod diet (1.4%–3.8%), while snow crab and Tanner
26 crab at age 1 made up a large proportion of their diet (84%–95% and 27%–57%, respectively) [61].
27 Similar studies conducted in Kodiak Alaska from 1973-1975 looked at groundfish stomachs of
28 Pacific cod (n=4,000), sculpins (Myoxocephalus spp., n=320), and Yellow Irish lord (Hemilepidotus
29 jordani, n=535) and found that less than 2% of the stomach contents contained red king crab, while
30 Tanner crab were the dominant prey crab species [62]. These results indicate that these groundfish
31 species are not major predators on red king crab, which is similar in size and morphology to
32 golden king crab.
33 Mean spine contribution (mm) to legal sized male golden king crab ranged from 8.9–10.1 mm
34 and varied across management areas, but whether this variation is biologically meaningful is
35 not clear. The 1.2 mm difference between the largest and smallest estimates does not have any
36 resulting management implications. Studies of hatchery-raised and wild juvenile red king crab in
37 Southeast Alaska [63] and blue crab in Maryland [64] suggest that crab spine length can be plastic
38 and become larger in the presence of predators. Future studies could investigate the influence of
39 predators on spine lengths for golden king crab in Southeast Alaska. It is interesting that even
40 though spine length for golden king crab varied slightly among management areas, the pattern
41 was different from the spatial pattern in SMM variation.
42 Variable growth rates could influence golden king crab size at maturity. In Southeast Alaska
43 historical data on mean growth increment per molt lacked sufficient spatial resolution to
44 determine if variability exists across management areas, as data are available from limited areas,
45 primarily from Frederick Sound and Lynn Canal [31]. Growth increment per molt for male golden
46 king crab in the eastern Aleutian Islands (Amukta, Chagulak, and Yunaska) was 14.5 mm CL
47 (n=517, SD=2.95) [65,66]. Unfortunately, data on growth in the Aleutian Islands were not spatially
48 identified, so spatial resolution to determine variability in growth rates was not available [66].
49 Growth of golden king crab greater than 90 mm CL from the Aleutians was relatively constant,
50 indicating that growth rates may stabilize once a certain size is reached [66]. In the Beagle
51 Channel, Argentina southern king crab (Lithodes santolla) growth increment per molt was 11.4 mm
52 CL (n=66, SD=1.7) [65]. However, other growth studies from the Strait of Magellan and Beagle
53 Channel found that crab >70 mm CL on average had a growth increment of 11.1 mm and 9.3
54 mm CL, respectively, indicating spatial variability in growth [67,68]. To determine if growth is
55 spatially variable for golden king crab across Southeast Alaska, mark-recapture studies could be
56 conducted in different management areas.

Another possible explanation that may be influencing golden king crab growth is the parasite
7 16
B. auratum, previously identified as B. callosus, a parasitic barnacle that suppresses growth,
8
feminizes and castrates male crab and sterilizes female crab [41]. This parasite has a root system
9
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
(interna) that runs through the inside of its host taking over their body and produces multiple
10
egg sacs (externa) under the abdominal flap [39]. Because B. auratum suppresses growth, it could
11
potentially hinder the size at which crabs become mature, resulting in very few infected crab that
12
would recruit to the fishery and be removed to prevent further infections [39,69,70]. In Southeast
13
Alaska, from 1998–2014 observers documented the highest incidence rate of infection in Clarence
14
Strait (3.7%, n=6,011), while the remaining management areas combined from 2000-2014 had a
15
much lower infection rate (0.3%, n=65,043) (A. Olson, personal observation). In the most recent
16
years, from 2011 to 2014, fishery observers documented 176 infected crabs in Clarence Strait, while
17
..............................................................
in contrast, only 27 crabs from the remaining management areas combined were infected.
18 Research on golden king crab genetics could reveal stock structure and provide management
19 information to create biologically representative management areas to better manage the fishery.
20 Genetic studies of red king crab in the North Pacific revealed three distinct genetic groupings:
21 1) Adak Island, 2) Bering Sea-Gulf of Alaska, and 3) Southeast Alaska, with Southeast Alaska
22 having the lowest levels of genetic diversity and mtDNA, but significant genetic heterogeneity
23 among populations over a small geographic scale [71,72]. This result suggests that the glacial fjord
24 system and enclosed bays of Southeast Alaska may result in decreased connectivity among king
25 crab populations, with potentially limited larval dispersal and limited gene flow resulting in self-
26 recruiting populations [71–73]. The current management areas in Southeast Alaska are based on
27 historical harvest patterns and are derived from statistical areas that are entirely used for salmon
28 management. Thus, the spatial arrangement of these statistical areas dictates possible boundaries
29 for management areas for golden king crab and may not be representative of biologically distinct
30 stocks. Future genetic studies of golden king crab could determine if heterogeneity among
31 management areas exists and inform if the current management areas in Southeast Alaska truly
32 represent separate stocks.
33 Sampling bias in size at maturity in this study is possible because crab were caught using pots,
34 which are known to capture a disproportionately greater number of larger mature crab than small
35 immature crab [74]. Sampling bias from pot sampling could result in size at maturity estimates
36 that are biased towards mature individuals due to the size bias of the pot. One of the management
37 areas in this study, North Stephens Passage, contained few small crabs. This maturity estimate
38 may be biased because the likelihood of obtaining smaller crab in the re-sampling of the bootstrap
39 procedure was low and resulted in a large upper bound confidence interval. Because all crabs in
40 this study were captured with pots, this sampling bias applies throughout and therefore does not
41 simply explain the spatial variability in maturity estimates observed. An alternative sampling
42 method, such as trawling, could potentially sample both small and large crab; but trawling is not
43 feasible due to the narrow channels and rocky shores of the fjord system in Southeast Alaska.
44 Information on life history is a critical to the successful long-term sustainability and
45 management of a fishery. Parameters such as maturity, growth, and reproduction provide a
46 basis for defining fishing seasons, legal size, and harvest levels without adversely affecting the
47 reproductive potential of a fished stock. In Southeast Alaska, golden king crab is a prime example
48 of the effect of gaps in our understanding of life history on a fishery. Incorporating life history
49 parameters into management and increasing legal size will improve sustainability of the golden
50 king crab fishery and hopefully allow recovery of a collapsed fishery.

31 e-mail: andrew.olson@alaska.gov maturity varied for crabs among seven management
32 areas in Southeast Alaska, where male maturity sizes
33 increased with latitude and differed from published
34 estimates across their North Pacific range, where size
35 at maturity decreased with increasing latitude. Depth,
36 temperature, and harvest history were not related
37 to variation observed in male maturity estimates.
38 Management implications from this research include
39 reducing legal size in some areas to maximize harvest
40 potential and increasing in others to allow male crab
41 the opportunity to reproduce before being harvested.
42 A more conservative strategy would incorporate the
43 largest maturity size, increasing the legal size which
44 would have a negative to the commercial fishery, but
45 allow male crab the opportunity to reproduce before
46 being harvested. This study shows the importance of
47 understanding how life history characteristics change
48 over space and the challenge incorporating spatial
49 variability for improved fisheries management.

8 Minimum size limits are an established fisheries management tool that has been utilized to
9
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
help ensure long term sustainability of fishery stocks. A minimum size limit for legal size
10 allows for individuals to reproduce and contribute to future populations and prevent recruitment
11 overfishing [1,2]. Legal size is used in male-only crab fisheries in the North Pacific and is primarily
12 based on size at maturity while incorporating other life history parameters such as growth and
13 molting frequency. Sex and size-selectivity in crab fisheries allows for long-term reproductive
14 viability and sustainability by allowing a proportion of males from a stock to be harvested while
15 females are left to continually reproduce [1,3]. Size at maturity in males for some crab species can
16 be estimated by using the breaking point in the ratio between chela height (CH) and carapace
17 length (CL), also known as size at 50% morphometric maturity (SMM), because claw size in
..............................................................
18 males is one of the secondary sexual characteristics that changes at the onset of morphological
19 maturity [4–7]. While in females, size at 50% maturity (SAM) is estimated by examining the
20 presence of embryos or embryo cases attached to the pleopods [8,9]. Examining size at maturity in
21 both males and females may inform how size at maturity may be influenced by fisheries between
22 a harvested and unharvested proportion of a stock within the same species.
23 Size at maturity can vary within or among geographic areas, leading to challenges in fisheries
24 management. Spatial variability in size at maturity has been observed in high latitude crab
25 species such as, Tanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi) [10], snow crab (C. opilio) [11], red king crab
26 (Paralithodes camtschaticus) [12], blue king crab (P. platypus) [13], and golden king crab (Lithodes
27 aequispinus) [9,14]. Size at maturity estimates were generally found to decrease with latitude,
28 except for Tanner crab, which varied by longitude [10,15]. Interestingly, the latitudinal pattern
29 observed of decreased size at maturity is contrary to Bergmann’s rule, which states that animals
30 living in lower latitudes and warmer climates are generally smaller than animals living in higher
31 latitudes and colder climates [16]. Spatial variation in size at maturity for crab species in the North
32 Pacific has been hypothesized to be dependent upon 1) temperature, which is associated with
33 metabolic rate, growth rate, molt timing, and molt increment, 2) size-selective historical fishing
34 pressure [10,15,17,18], and 3) genetic variation [11].
35 Variation in size at maturity can be influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors, such
36 as temperature, food availability, and size-selective fishing pressure. Temperature and food
37 availability are key environmental variables that can influence size at maturity. In ectotherms,
38 cooler temperatures retard growth and delay maturity, causing individuals to mature at a larger
39 size compared to species in warmer environments [19]. Growth rate and size at maturity are
40 also influenced by food availability, in which increased food availability can result in earlier
41 maturation due to increased amounts of reserved energy [20]. Whether temperature, food
42 availability, or their interaction is most influential on size at maturity continues to be debated
43 among scientists and is commonly known as the Berrigan-Charnov puzzle [20,21]. Size selectivity
44 of fishing gear may remove faster maturing and growing individuals, while allowing late
45 maturing and slow growing individuals to avoid harvest and reproduce, causing an overall
46 decline in size and age at maturity [22,23]. If growth rate is heritable, this resultant evolutionary
47 effect can decrease population growth, greatly impeding recovery in an overfished population
48 and lead to fishery closures [24]. Evidence of this effect exists for many species, including Pacific
49 salmon (Salmonidae) [23] and gastropods in Southern California [25]. However, the effects of
50 fishing pressure on SAM have not been examined in many commercially important species,
51 especially crab.
52 Golden king crab are widely distributed across the North Pacific and largely lack biological
53 information to help inform fisheries management. Golden king crab life history attributes include:
54 morphometrically mature at approximately 8 years, 20 month reproductive cycle, lecithotrophic
55 larvae that remain at depth, mature females molt approximately every 1.5 to 2 yr, and mature
56 males molt every 10 to 33 mo [26–29]. Slow growth and late maturation make golden king crab
57 vulnerable to overfishing. Golden king crab inhabit a very inaccessible environment distributed

across the North Pacific at depths ranging from 100 to 1,000 m and thus lack much of the basic

biological information to inform fisheries management [8,9,30].

eastern Bering Sea, and Southeast Alaska that emerged after the collapse of the red and blue
10
king crab commercial fisheries in Alaska in the early 1980s [8,9,31,32]. The commercial fishery
11
further developed in Southeast Alaska with harvest peaking twice in 1987 (461 t) and 2010 (332
12
t) and has undergone a period of collapse in the 1990s and is currently in a collapsed state with a
13
harvest of 107 t in 2014 [29]. Management of the Southeast Alaska golden king crab commercial
14
fishery is conducted based on a 3-S (sex, size, and season) management system and has further
15
developed by limiting the number participants, establishing a catch quota per management area,
16
and allowing management to close areas if there are stock health concerns. The fishing season
17
..............................................................
typically occurs from February to May or until the catch quota is obtained [29]. The current
18 management areas for the Southeast Alaska golden king crab fishery consist of Lynn Canal, Icy
19 Strait, North Stephens Passage, Frederick Sound, Mid-Chatham Strait, Lower Chatham Strait, and
20 Clarence Strait (Fig 1). Male-only harvest is allowed using a minimum legal size of 177.8 mm/7.0
21 in carapace width (CW), intended to allow crab to mature and reproduce at least once before
22 being harvested.
23 The historical process on setting the minimum harvest size limit in Southeast Alaska is not
24 very clear; however, information on a variety sources was considered. The minimum size limit
25 for male golden king crab was originally based on growth and maturity information for red king
26 crab from the Gulf of Alaska, which is a different species from a different location [33,34], due
27 to the lack of biological information on golden king crab. This size limit was later justified using
28 biological data on golden king crab life history [29] as it became available, which consisted of
29 growth information primarily from Frederick Sound and Lynn Canal in Southeast Alaska using
30 a tagging study [31] and SMM estimates most likely from the southeastern Bering Sea (130.0 mm
31 CL) [9]. While SAM and growth are the main components of legal size, spine lengths on a crab’s
32 carapace play a critical role in determining if a specimen is legal for harvest and also requires
33 a closer look. Spine length is included in harvest size limits, and thus variability in spine length
34 could influence the impact of size limits on the fished population. Many invertebrate species, such
35 as the red sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) [35], mud crab (Rhithropanopeus harrisii) [36],
36 and blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) [37], have increased survival attributed to spine morphology
37 that reduces predation risk [38]. Potential predators avoid prey with longer spines due to their
38 unpalatability, and spine length is plastic and can respond to predation pressure [35,37,38]. How
39 spine length varies in golden king crab remains unknown.
40 In Southeast Alaska, golden king crab size at maturity has not been estimated and information
41 on basic life history parameters specific to Southeast Alaska is needed to ensure that fisheries
42 management reflects the regionally specific biology. In this study, we estimate spatial variability
43 in SMM and SAM, the influence of temperature, depth and harvest on spatial variation in SMM
44 estimates, and mean spine contribution to legal sized males with the overall goal to better inform
45 fisheries management to sustainably manage the golden king crab fishery.

8 Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) observers measured golden king crab during
9
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
the commercial fishery (February–May) in Southeast Alaska. Male golden king crab CL and CH
10 were measured to the nearest 1 mm during 2007–2014 (n=9,786). Female CL was measured and
11 pleopods inspected to determine maturity during 1998–2015 (n=14,242). Crabs that were visually
12 infected with Briarosaccus auratum (n=448) were excluded from the analysis, because they are
13 known to suppress growth, potentially hindering maturity [39–41]. Observer coverage included
14 at least one trip in one of the seven management areas in Southeast Alaska each year (Fig 1). Male
15 SMM was estimated by fitting a piece-wise linear regression model to the relationship between CL
16 (independent variable) and CH (dependent variable) by least squares. Male SMM was estimated
17 as the breakpoint of the following model:
..............................................................
18
19
20 y = ß0 + ß1 (X) + ß2 (X - C)+ +  (2.1)
21 where y=CH (mm), ß0 , ß1 , and ß2 are estimated regression parameters, X=CL (mm), C represents
22 the breakpoint, the term (X - C)+ takes the value of zero if the argument is negative and the
23 value of the argument if it is positive, and  is the error term. Parameters were estimated using the
24 statistical program R 3.1.3 [42] and the extension package SiZer: Significant Zero Crossings [43]
25 and 95% confidence intervals for the breakpoint and the slope parameters were obtained using
26 a bootstrap procedure. One thousand bootstrap samples were taken by resampling the raw data
27 points and refitting the piece-wise linear regression model to calculate 50% SMM for each of
28 the 1,000 estimates [44]. We compared SMM among management areas using the Fisher-Behrens
29 statistic:
30
31
32 |Cˆ - Cˆ2 |
z = q1 (2.2)
33 s21 + s22
34
35 where C1 and C2 are size at morphometric maturity estimates from different areas and s1 and
36 s2 are standard errors associated with these estimates. The Fisher-Behrens statistic was then
37 compared to the critical value of a normal distribution, z1- 1-a , adjusted for multiple tests using a
2
38 Bonferroni correction, which replaces a with a n , where a=0.05 and n=total number of hypotheses
39 to be tested (21) [45,46].
40 Female SAM was determined based on the presence of embryos or empty embryo cases
41 attached to the pleopods [8,9]. Maturity was estimated by fitting a logistic regression model to
42 the proportion of mature females at a given CL (mm):
43
44 1
45 P= (2.3)
1 + e-a(CL-b)
46
47 where P is the predicted proportion of mature females at a given CL (mm), and a and b are
48 estimated parameters. Parameter a represents the shape of the curve and parameter b is the SAM
49 CL (mm). The negative log-likelihood was estimated at each maturity proportion as:
50
51
- loge CL = -[M loge (P + 0.0001) + I loge (P + 0.0001)] (2.4)
52
53 where M =number of mature crab and I = number of immature crab at a given CL (mm). The
54 Excel SOLVER feature was used to find the values of parameters a and b that minimize the sum
55 of the negative log-likelihoods [47]. The fitted logistic model was then evaluated to determine the
56 CL that corresponds with 50% SAM [4], and 95% confidence intervals were determined using
57 bootstrapping with 1,000 replicates, implemented in the statistical program R 3.1.3 [4,42]. To
58 determine if SAM differed significantly among areas, a log-likelihood ratio test was used [46,48]:

where CLR is the reduced model with a SAM estimate from a given area and CLF is the full
10
model that estimates maturity for the combined data and is compared to the reduced model.
11
Male SMM estimates and female SAM estimates from their geographic distribution from
12
published literature (Japan, eastern Russia, eastern Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and British
13
Columbia, Canada) as well as from the seven management areas in Southeast Alaska were
14
analyzed together and separately (only Southeast Alaska management areas) as a function of
15
latitude using a linear regression model:
16
17
..............................................................
18 y = ß0 + ß1 x +  (2.6)
19
20 where y=size at maturity estimates (male SMM or female SAM), ß0 and ß1 are estimated
21 regression parameters, x=mean latitude (degrees), and =error terms. Size at morphometric
22 maturity for male golden king crab in Prince William Sound, Alaska [49] was estimated using
23 a method that differed from those used in the rest of the literature and, because of this, were
24 excluded from this analysis.
25 Because removals of males in the fishery could result in variation in SMM estimates, we
26 examined variation in commercial harvest using ADF&G landing data from management areas to
27 determine if fishery harvest was related to variation observed in SMM estimates. Effects of fishery
28 harvest on male SMM estimates from Southeast Alaska were analyzed using linear regression
29 models by comparing the total harvest for each management area from two different time periods,
30 1972–2014 or 2005–2014, to maturity estimates:
31
32 y = ß0 + ß1 x +  (2.7)
33
34 where y=size at maturity estimates for male crab from seven management areas, ß0 and ß1
35 are estimated regression parameters, x=total harvest (t) from 1972–2014 or 2005–2014 for each
36 management area, and =error terms.
37
38 (b) Environmental Variability
39
40 Depth and temperature, which may vary across management areas and influence variation in
41 SMM for golden king crab, were measured from February to May during commercial fishing
42 seasons. ADF&G observers recorded crab pot depth from 1998–2014 from fishing vessel sonar
43 measurements, which ranged from 40–750 m (n=6,804) (Table 1).

47 Because temperature data were opportunistically collected by fishery observers and varied
48 by which months and years were sampled across management areas, we examined seasonal
49 and yearly variation in near-bottom temperature at 250 m, a depth representative of golden
50 king crab habitat, using a long-term time series from a mooring station in the northern Gulf of
51 Alaska. The temperature data were retrieved from a publicly available database maintained by
52 the University of Alaska Fairbanks School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences (http://www.ims.
53 uaf.edu/gak1/). The Gulf of Alaska (GAK1) mooring station is located adjacent to the coast
54 near Seward (59<U+25E6> 50.7’ N, 149<U+25E6> 28.0’W) at a depth of 250 m. Temperature measurements at 250 m,
55 recorded every quarter hour (n=200,299), were averaged by month during 2008-2013 (January–
56 December, n=72). Mean monthly temperatures from GAK1 (n=72) were evaluated by fitting a
57 one-way repeated measures ANOVA and compared using Tukey’s HSD pairwise comparisons
58 (a<0.05). Then monthly mean temperatures for GAK1 and Southeast Alaska (GAK1: February

8
using Tukey’s HSD pairwise comparisons (a<0.05). These analyses were used to determine 1)

consistency in temperature at depth across months and 2) whether opportunistic intermittent
10
sampling by fisheries observers (February–May from 2008–2014) are representative of those
11
measured consistently in the northern Gulf of Alaska.
12
13
14 (c) Crab Size and Spine Contribution
15 We investigated the CW, CL and spine contribution to size of legal male golden king crab to
16 determine variation among and to develop growth equations for management areas of Southeast
17
..............................................................
Alaska. ADF&G observers and port samplers sampled legal sized males during 2013–2014
18 (n=1,592) and measured CL and CW to the nearest 1 mm with and without spines at the widest
19 point of the carapace. Additionally, port samplers measured CL of legal size males (n=93,075)
20 during 1972–2014 to quantify the size of crab commercially harvested. Spine contribution was
21 calculated as the difference in CW with and without spines and includes contribution of spines
22 on both sides of the carapace. Estimates of spine contribution, CW and CL were compared across
23 management areas using an ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD pairwise comparisons (a<0.05) using JMP
24 11.0.0 statistical software [50].
25
26
27 (d) Legal Size
28 To reassess the current legal size in each of the management areas in Southeast Alaska, estimates
29 of mean spine contribution, SMM, and an area wide growth increment (16.3 mm CL, SD=3.0,
30 n=45 from Lynn Canal, Icy Strait, and Frederick Sound) [31] were used to generate a spatially-
31 specific legal size. These metrics were then used in conjunction with CL and CW measurements
32 to develop a CL-CW model in all 7 management areas to determine if golden king crab males
33 have at least one opportunity to reproduce before being harvested under the current fishery legal
34 size of 177.8 mm/7.0 in CW. The relationship between CL and CW was used in order to convert
35 CL measurements (morphometric maturity and molt increment) into CW because the commercial
36 fishery uses CW for legal size determinations:
37
38
39 CW = mCL - b (2.11)
40 where CW is given carapace width (mm), CL is a given carapace length (mm), m is the slope,
41 and b is the CW intercept. Equation 2.11 was then modified to incorporate SMM estimates, a molt
42 increment, and mean spine contribution:
43
44
45 CW = (m(SM Ma + molt increment) - b) + mean spine contributiona (2.12)
46 where SM M is the size at 50% morphometric maturity estimate, a is the area of interest, and b is
47 the CW intercept from Eq. 2.11, and mean spine contribution.
48
49
50 3. Results
51
52 (a) Size at Maturity
53 Male SMM estimates varied significantly across management areas, with the largest difference of
54 40.1 mm occurring between Icy Strait and Lower Chatham Strait. Icy Strait crabs had the largest
55 SMM estimate (158.0 mm CL), followed by Lynn Canal (147.3 mm CL), Clarence Strait (138.5 mm
56 CL), Frederick Sound (137.6 mm CL), North Stephens Passage (131.9 mm CL), Mid-Chatham
57 Strait (127.3 mm CL), and Lower Chatham Strait (117.9 mm CL) (Fig 2 and Table 3). Fisher-
58 Behrens statistics showed significant differences among many of the management areas (Fig

Maturity estimates of golden king crab decreased with increasing latitude over their
7 10
geographic distribution when excluding Southeast Alaska, for both males (F =16.75, p-
8
value=0.003, R2 =0.677) and females (F =48.22, p-value=0.0001, R2 =0.858) (Fig 3). Male SMM
9
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
in Southeast Alaska was not related to latitude when the most southerly area, Clarence Strait,
10
was included in the analysis (F =3.092, p-value=0.139, R2 =0.382) (Fig 4A). However, when
11
Clarence Strait was removed from the analysis, SMM increased with increasing latitude (F =10.94,
12
p-value=0.0297, R2 =0.665) (Fig 4B). For females latitude was not related to SAM (F =1.64, p-
13
value=0.256, R2 =0.247) (Fig 4A), even when crabs from Clarence Strait were removed from the
14
analysis (F =0.310, p-value=0.586, R2 =0.080) (Fig 4B). Interestingly, for Clarence Strait both male
15
SMM and female SAM estimates did not fit the increasing latitudinal cline observed in Southeast
16
Alaska indicating that Clarence Strait is a uniquely different area among the other managements

areas.
18 Fishery harvest varied among management areas but was not related to variation in SMM.
19 Total harvest during 1972–2014 was highest in Frederick Sound (3,671 t) and Lynn Canal (2,054
20 t), followed by Mid-Chatham Strait (1,499 t), Icy Strait (741 t), North Stephens Passage (306 t),
21 Lower Chatham Strait (304 t), and Clarence Strait (161 t). Fishery harvest, using total harvest from
22 the commercial fishery from 1972–2014, did not explain the variation observed in male golden
23 king crab SMM estimates for Southeast Alaska (F =0.1624, p-value=0.704, R2 =0.032). Additionally,
24 harvest from a more recent time period (2005–2014) did not explain the variation observed in
25 SMM estimates (F =0.205, p-value=0.670, R2 =0.039). Total harvest from 2005–2014 was highest
26 in Frederick Sound (1,131 t) and Lynn Canal (639 t) followed by Mid-Chatham Strait (427 t), Icy
27 Strait (211 t), North Stephens Passage (79 t), Clarence Strait (76 t), and Lower Chatham Strait (65
28 t).

31 Figure 3. Latitudinal variation in SMM and SAM for golden king crab from the published literature. Male maturity estimates
32 were determined using SMM and female maturity estimates were determined using SAM. Maturity estimates from the
33 published literature include: Japan (J) [8,51]; the southern, central, and northern Kuril Islands (SK, CK, and NK) [14] and
34 eastern Sakhalin Island (ES) [52], Russia; Seguam Pass (SP), Bowers Ridge (BR) [32]; south, central, and northeastern
35 Bering Sea (SEBS, CEBS, and NEBS) with 95% confidence intervals for males [10] Alaska; and Canada (BC) with 95%
36 confidence intervals [8]. Note that the Japanese estimated SAM for females reflects the estimated size at which 60% of
37 the females were found to be mature [8,51]. A linear regression line for male (solid) and female (dotted) golden king crab
38 is plotted to represent the strength in the latitudinal cline across Japan, eastern Russia, the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands,
39 and Canada. Both male (R2 =0.677) and female (R2 =0.858) golden king crab exhibited strong patterns in latitudinal
40 variation with SMM and SAM estimates decreasing as latitude increased.

53 The mean depth of pots sampled during the commercial fishery varied significantly among
54 management areas with five groupings (Table 4). Pots sampled in Mid-Chatham Strait and Lower
55 Chatham Strait were the deepest, with mean depths below 500 m, followed by Lynn Canal and
56 Clarence Strait with depths approximately 350 m. Mean depth of pots in Frederick Sound, Icy
57 Strait, and North Stephens Passage ranged from 240 to 305 m (Table 4).

21 The mean monthly bottom temperature sampled during the golden king crab commercial
22 fishery (February–May) varied within a range of 5.1–6.0<U+25E6> C among management areas and the 250
23 m depth GAK1 mooring station (Fig 5). Monthly mean temperatures for GAK1 throughout the
24 year ranged from a low of 5.3<U+25E6> C in May, June, August, and September to a high of 6.1<U+25E6> C in January
25 (Fig 6). When GAK1 and pooled Southeast Alaska temperatures were analyzed for monthly
26 variation between locations during the timing of the golden king crab commercial fishery, there
27 was a significant interaction between location and month (F =5.28, p-value=0.006). During the
28 month of February, temperatures measured in Southeast Alaska were significantly cooler than
29 at GAK1 (p-value=0.0013), but these differences did not occur in March, April, or May (Fig 6).
30 Additionally, SMM was not related to variation in depth across management areas (F =1.778,
31 p-value=0.240, and R2 =0.262) and did not relate to variation in mean monthly temperature by
32 management area from Southeast Alaska (F =0.492, p-value=0.5, R2 =0.0394) and month was a
33 non-significant covariate (p-value=0.979).

50
Mean spine contribution to legal size measurements varied among areas, but the magnitude of the

differences was very small and not likely biologically relevant (approximately 1 mm). Clarence
52
Strait had the largest spine contribution (10.1 mm) followed by North Stephens Passage (10.0
53
mm), Lower Chatham Strait (9.6 mm), Lynn Canal (9.2 mm), Mid-Chatham Strait (9.0 mm),
54
Frederick Sound (8.9 mm), and Icy Strait (8.9 mm). Clarence Strait mean spine contribution to
55
legal size was larger than Lynn Canal, Mid-Chatham Strait, Frederick Sound and Icy Strait (Table
56

57
larger than Mid-Chatham Strait, Frederick Sound, and Icy Strait (Table 5).

21 (d) Legal Size
22
Using the CL–CW relationship for each area and incorporating SMM estimates, growth increment
23
from Southeast Alaska (16.3 mm CL), and mean spine contribution to legal size, and assuming
24
that reproduction occurs after molting, we calculated that crab are capable of reproducing at
25
least once before being harvested and reaching the current legal size (177.8 mm CW) in five
26
out of seven areas (Table 6). Projected area-specific legal size estimates (CW) for Clarence Strait
27
(177.6 mm), Frederick Sound (173.4 mm), North Stephens Passage (168.8 mm), Mid-Chatham
28
Strait (163.2 mm), and Lower Chatham Strait (159.8 mm) remain under the current legal size.
29
Projected area-specific legal size estimates (CW) for Icy Strait (196.5 mm) and Lynn Canal (186.0
30
mm) substantially exceeded current legal size (177.8 mm). Area-specific CL-CW models, which
31
were used to convert SMM in CL to CW, were significant for all areas (p-value<0.001). North
32
Stephens Passage had the strongest relationship between CL and CW (n= 152, F =1,803, R2 =0.92),
33
followed by Frederick Sound (n=623, F =4,362, R2 =0.88), Icy Strait (n=121, F =818.5, R2 =0.87),
34
Clarence Strait (n=171, F =995.6, R2 =0.85), Lynn Canal (n=187, F =1,064, R2 =0.85), Mid-Chatham

allow crabs to reproduce at least once and thus prevent overharvest. The explanation for spatial
7 13
variation in SMM estimates of male golden king crab in Southeast Alaska is not immediately
8
apparent, as SMM was unrelated to depth, temperature, harvest pressure, and spine length.
9
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
Estimates of male SMM generally increased with latitude within Southeast Alaska, but the
10
relationship was not significant, while estimates of female SAM did not vary with latitude. This
11
intriguing pattern, which is the opposite of what is observed over a broad geographic area (Fig
12
2) and Bergmann’s rule, may result from the glacial fjord system and unique habitats of golden
13
king crab in Southeast Alaska. Female SAM in Southeast Alaska was smaller than male SMM,
14
and the differences among management areas varied less for females than for males. The small
15
differences across management areas for females suggest that female golden king crab become
16
sexually mature over a narrow size range. Interestingly, Aleutian Islands female golden king crab
17
..............................................................
populations sampled in 1981–1984 have a smaller SAM range (106.4 mm–110.7 mm) [9,32] than
18 those in Southeast Alaska (100.4 mm–119.0 mm).
19 Estimates of male golden king crab location-specific mature CWs which incorporated SMM,
20 growth increment, and mean spine contribution to legal size in Southeast Alaska revealed that
21 the current legal size of 177.8 mm/7.0 in CW may not allow crab to reproduce at least once before
22 being harvested in two of the seven management areas: Icy Strait and Lynn Canal. This indicates
23 that the current legal size for the golden king crab commercial fishery in Southeast Alaska could
24 be improved to incorporate area-specific maturity; however a revised management approach is
25 not clear. Adoption of area-specific legal sizes for each management area would be ideal as it
26 would maximize harvest for each area, but this is not practical because fishermen harvest from
27 multiple management areas at the same time, thus it would be difficult to enforce. The most
28 conservative option would be to increase the legal size throughout the region to exceed the largest
29 area specific legal size CW (Icy Strait (196.5 mm/7.7 in CW)), so that no single area is potentially
30 overexploited. If the legal size was increased to 196.5 mm/7.7 in CW, the potential harvest loss
31 based on historical harvest from 1972–2014 would differ across management areas, with greatest
32 harvest loss in Lower Chatham (84%) and least in Lynn Canal (38%) (Table 7). To alleviate the high
33 potential loss of harvest in Lower Chatham Strait, which has the smallest SMM estimate (117.9
34 mm CL) and area-specific legal size (159.8 mm/6.3 in CW), an alternative management strategy
35 could be applied by opening this area to a reduced legal size when all other management areas are
36 closed. We did not calculate long-term harvest loss owing to a reduction in reproductive output
37 associated with harvest of males before they had a chance to reproduce. This issue and the recent
38 decline in harvest and large size at morphometric maturities, especially in Icy Strait and Lynn
39 Canal, are worthy of future study.
40 Male SMM estimates in Southeast Alaska varied spatially among contiguous waterways,
41 including Frederick Sound, Mid-Chatham Strait, and Lower Chatham Strait. This variation may
42 indicate that crabs may segregate by size or could be spatially separate populations. In contrast,
43 areas that were spatially separated had crabs with similar SMM; crabs from Clarence Strait
44 were surprisingly not significantly different in SMM from Frederick Sound and North Stephens
45 Passage. Low power resulting from a small sample size and lack of immature crabs may explain
46 this result for North Stephens Passage and more samples may reveal a difference. We initially
47 planned to examine SMM estimates over time for each management area to reveal temporal
48 variability and elucidate mechanisms for variability in size at morphometric maturity. However,
49 variable sampling effort across management areas and years by fishery observers and declines
50 in population levels over the past few years resulted in too small sample sizes when data were
51 subdivided by years.
52 We could not detect an influence of depth or temperature on SMM for male golden
53 king crab. Mean depth varied among management areas and ranged from 246 m to 514 m.
54 Mean temperature measured on crab pots and at a long term mooring at 250 m depth was
55 relatively constant and ranged only over 1<U+25E6> C, from 5.1 <U+25E6> C to 6.1 <U+25E6> C. Significant differences in
56 mean temperature occurred in February between Southeast Alaska and the mooring at GAK1,
57 suggesting that winter temperatures may be colder in the protected inner waters of Southeast

29 Alaska than offshore in the Gulf of Alaska. Bottom temperature data were only available at the
30 time of the fishery in Southeast Alaska and seasonal variation in temperature at depth could be
31 further investigated. It was surprising that temperature was not related to the variability in male
32 SMM estimates observed for golden king crab in Southeast Alaska, but this result may arise from
33 the lack of variation in temperature at deep depths.
34 We found no relationship between total harvest of golden king crab over two different time
35 periods, from 1972–2014 or 2005–2014, and SMM estimates across management areas. We were
36 not able to resolve shorter-term patterns, due to small sample sizes of crabs in any given year. The
37 relationship between maturity and harvest pressure could be further investigated to determine if
38 temporal variability in harvest pressure may have an effect on size at maturity for golden king
39 crab and to better inform current size at maturity estimates. The influence of harvest pressure
40 on SMM can have important implications for fisheries management [7,23]. Removing larger
41 and more reproductively viable individuals can result in decreased size at maturity, which then
42 requires an adjustment to harvest strategy to maintain harvest rates and spawning biomass [7].
43 Reductions in size at maturity can exacerbate population declines, leading to a collapse if fisheries
44 management does not adapt by adjusting minimum legal size and gear selectivity in order
45 maintain fishery sustainability [24]. The sustainability of the Southeast Alaska golden king crab
46 fishery is questionable, as it has collapsed multiple times, thus monitoring SMM to detect possible
47 temporal changes could potentially inform of future sustainability concerns. If a larger legal size
48 were to be adopted, future studies could investigate if spatial variation in SMM changes over time
49 and across management areas.
50 A similar study was conducted in Southeast Alaska looking at influences of latitude,
51 temperature, depth, and harvest pressure on size at maturity estimates for male and female
52 Tanner crab [53]. Variability in maturity estimates was observed across Southeast Alaska, but did
53 not follow a latitudinal cline as we observed for populations of golden king crab. Interestingly,
54 neither temperature, depth, or harvest pressure explained the variability observed in Tanner crab
55 maturity estimates, similar to our results here. Siddon and Bednarski [51] attributed the lack of
56 a relationship between these factors and maturity estimates to temperature influences on growth
57 and the limiting effects of food availability. As temperature increases, molting frequency and
58 overall growth increase in the lab for Tanner crab and blue crab [54,55]. When food availability

is limited, less energy is available for growth and reproduction, which can cause delays in size at
7 15
maturation [56,57]. Temperature in golden king crab habitat at depth varied by location, but by
8
less than 1.0 <U+25E6> C, indicating temperature effects on growth and food availability may be minimal.

However, competition for prey resources and predator influences on golden king crab could
10
cause variation in food availability and potentially spatial variation in size at maturity, but this
11
hypothesis needs to be further investigated.
12
Predation may be influential in determining size at maturity through direct and indirect effects.
13
High levels of predation can increase the rate of growth and speed at which a prey species
14
reaches maturity in order to contribute to future populations with the trade-off of having a
15
higher mortality rate [58,59]. On the other hand predators can indirectly influence prey foraging
16
behavior and through reduced foraging opportunity limit food availability, with the result of
17
..............................................................
reduced growth rate and ultimately delaying the onset of maturity [60]. A variety of predators
18 consume golden king crab, such as Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), Pacific cod (Gadus
19 macrocephalus), and sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), based on anecdotal reports from the fishing
20 community and observations of stomach contents in processed fish (L. Norheim, fisherman,
21 Petersburg, AK, personal communication, 2015). Published information on groundfish predation
22 rates on king crab is limited; however, an analysis of stomach contents conducted by Livingston
23 (1989) from 1981–1984 looked at trends in Pacific cod predation on three commercially important
24 crab species in the eastern Bering Sea: red king crab, snow crab, and Tanner crab. Female red king
25 crab only made up a small portion of the Pacific cod diet (1.4%–3.8%), while snow crab and Tanner
26 crab at age 1 made up a large proportion of their diet (84%–95% and 27%–57%, respectively) [61].
27 Similar studies conducted in Kodiak Alaska from 1973-1975 looked at groundfish stomachs of
28 Pacific cod (n=4,000), sculpins (Myoxocephalus spp., n=320), and Yellow Irish lord (Hemilepidotus
29 jordani, n=535) and found that less than 2% of the stomach contents contained red king crab, while
30 Tanner crab were the dominant prey crab species [62]. These results indicate that these groundfish
31 species are not major predators on red king crab, which is similar in size and morphology to
32 golden king crab.
33 Mean spine contribution (mm) to legal sized male golden king crab ranged from 8.9–10.1 mm
34 and varied across management areas, but whether this variation is biologically meaningful is
35 not clear. The 1.2 mm difference between the largest and smallest estimates does not have any
36 resulting management implications. Studies of hatchery-raised and wild juvenile red king crab in
37 Southeast Alaska [63] and blue crab in Maryland [64] suggest that crab spine length can be plastic
38 and become larger in the presence of predators. Future studies could investigate the influence of
39 predators on spine lengths for golden king crab in Southeast Alaska. It is interesting that even
40 though spine length for golden king crab varied slightly among management areas, the pattern
41 was different from the spatial pattern in SMM variation.
42 Variable growth rates could influence golden king crab size at maturity. In Southeast Alaska
43 historical data on mean growth increment per molt lacked sufficient spatial resolution to
44 determine if variability exists across management areas, as data are available from limited areas,
45 primarily from Frederick Sound and Lynn Canal [31]. Growth increment per molt for male golden
46 king crab in the eastern Aleutian Islands (Amukta, Chagulak, and Yunaska) was 14.5 mm CL
47 (n=517, SD=2.95) [65,66]. Unfortunately, data on growth in the Aleutian Islands were not spatially
48 identified, so spatial resolution to determine variability in growth rates was not available [66].
49 Growth of golden king crab greater than 90 mm CL from the Aleutians was relatively constant,
50 indicating that growth rates may stabilize once a certain size is reached [66]. In the Beagle
51 Channel, Argentina southern king crab (Lithodes santolla) growth increment per molt was 11.4 mm
52 CL (n=66, SD=1.7) [65]. However, other growth studies from the Strait of Magellan and Beagle
53 Channel found that crab >70 mm CL on average had a growth increment of 11.1 mm and 9.3
54 mm CL, respectively, indicating spatial variability in growth [67,68]. To determine if growth is
55 spatially variable for golden king crab across Southeast Alaska, mark-recapture studies could be
56 conducted in different management areas.

Another possible explanation that may be influencing golden king crab growth is the parasite
7 16
B. auratum, previously identified as B. callosus, a parasitic barnacle that suppresses growth,
8
feminizes and castrates male crab and sterilizes female crab [41]. This parasite has a root system
9
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
(interna) that runs through the inside of its host taking over their body and produces multiple
10
egg sacs (externa) under the abdominal flap [39]. Because B. auratum suppresses growth, it could
11
potentially hinder the size at which crabs become mature, resulting in very few infected crab that
12
would recruit to the fishery and be removed to prevent further infections [39,69,70]. In Southeast
13
Alaska, from 1998–2014 observers documented the highest incidence rate of infection in Clarence
14
Strait (3.7%, n=6,011), while the remaining management areas combined from 2000-2014 had a
15
much lower infection rate (0.3%, n=65,043) (A. Olson, personal observation). In the most recent
16
years, from 2011 to 2014, fishery observers documented 176 infected crabs in Clarence Strait, while
17
..............................................................
in contrast, only 27 crabs from the remaining management areas combined were infected.
18 Research on golden king crab genetics could reveal stock structure and provide management
19 information to create biologically representative management areas to better manage the fishery.
20 Genetic studies of red king crab in the North Pacific revealed three distinct genetic groupings:
21 1) Adak Island, 2) Bering Sea-Gulf of Alaska, and 3) Southeast Alaska, with Southeast Alaska
22 having the lowest levels of genetic diversity and mtDNA, but significant genetic heterogeneity
23 among populations over a small geographic scale [71,72]. This result suggests that the glacial fjord
24 system and enclosed bays of Southeast Alaska may result in decreased connectivity among king
25 crab populations, with potentially limited larval dispersal and limited gene flow resulting in self-
26 recruiting populations [71–73]. The current management areas in Southeast Alaska are based on
27 historical harvest patterns and are derived from statistical areas that are entirely used for salmon
28 management. Thus, the spatial arrangement of these statistical areas dictates possible boundaries
29 for management areas for golden king crab and may not be representative of biologically distinct
30 stocks. Future genetic studies of golden king crab could determine if heterogeneity among
31 management areas exists and inform if the current management areas in Southeast Alaska truly
32 represent separate stocks.
33 Sampling bias in size at maturity in this study is possible because crab were caught using pots,
34 which are known to capture a disproportionately greater number of larger mature crab than small
35 immature crab [74]. Sampling bias from pot sampling could result in size at maturity estimates
36 that are biased towards mature individuals due to the size bias of the pot. One of the management
37 areas in this study, North Stephens Passage, contained few small crabs. This maturity estimate
38 may be biased because the likelihood of obtaining smaller crab in the re-sampling of the bootstrap
39 procedure was low and resulted in a large upper bound confidence interval. Because all crabs in
40 this study were captured with pots, this sampling bias applies throughout and therefore does not
41 simply explain the spatial variability in maturity estimates observed. An alternative sampling
42 method, such as trawling, could potentially sample both small and large crab; but trawling is not
43 feasible due to the narrow channels and rocky shores of the fjord system in Southeast Alaska.
44 Information on life history is a critical to the successful long-term sustainability and
45 management of a fishery. Parameters such as maturity, growth, and reproduction provide a
46 basis for defining fishing seasons, legal size, and harvest levels without adversely affecting the
47 reproductive potential of a fished stock. In Southeast Alaska, golden king crab is a prime example
48 of the effect of gaps in our understanding of life history on a fishery. Incorporating life history
49 parameters into management and increasing legal size will improve sustainability of the golden
50 king crab fishery and hopefully allow recovery of a collapsed fishery.

Appendix C
Reviewer comments: Spatial variability in Size at Maturity of Golden King Crab…
On the whole, this paper is well-written and the implications for fishery management of golden
king crab in southeast Alaska are well-reasoned. My main criticisms are in regard to the
presentation of male size-at-morphometric maturity (SMM).
Major comments
1. Data availability is listed as a prerequisite for publication. Search results for
doi:10.5061/dryad.jq344 on the DataDryad.org website (the address listed in the “Data
Availability” section of the manuscript) yielded “no results found”. This may be due to
an incorrect address being given, or the inexperience of this reviewer using the
DataDryad website.
2. The analysis of male size-at-morphometric maturity (SMM) is predicated on an assumed
linear relationship between chela height and carapace length that changes slope (and
intercept) at morphometric maturity. A previous study of golden king crab in the eastern
Bering Sea (Somerton and Otto, 1986) assumed that similar linear relationships existed,
but on log scales for both CH and CL. The authors do not show the fits of the
relationships they developed to the data they collected, but I think the fits are critical to
understanding and appreciating the rest of the results and arguments the authors present
for male SMM.
3. The authors refer to SMM several times as “50% SMM”, implying that 50% of males
reach morphometric maturity at the CL identified as the break point in the linear
relationships between CH and CL. However, this is incorrect. The breakpoint in their
analysis identifies the CL at which ALL, not 50% of, males achieve morphometric
maturity. Essentially, their analysis does not allow for a mixture of morphometrically
immature and mature males at the same CL (in contrast to Corgos and Freire, 2006, who
used PCA and discriminant analysis to identify the size at which 50% of male Maja
brachydactyla achieved morphometric maturity.
4. The SizeR package in R used to fit the breakpoint model consists of a number of
functions—it would simplify things to identify the function(s) used (presumably
piecewise.linear), but perhaps this is available on the DataDryad.org archive I was unable
to access.
5. The issue of sampling bias, p. 17 starting at line 33, as far as the analysis for SMM goes
could have been reduced by bootstrapping on residuals to the piecewise linear
regression/breakpoint analysis, rather than on resampling the original data which was
biased toward larger crab.
Editorial comments/suggestions
1. There are a number of small grammatical errors or perhaps typos in the manuscript. It
should be given a fresh “once over” by the principal author before final publication (see
2-4 below as examples).
2. P. 1, line 9: “A minimum size limit for legal size…” should be “Aminimum legal size
limit…”
3. A new paragraph should be started on p. 1, line 15 prior to “Size at maturity…”.
4. P. 1, line 16: “using the breaking point “ should be “using a break point”
5. P. 1, line 54: “…morphometric maturity…a 20 month…mature females molting…mature
males molting….
6. The sentence starting on p. 1, line 35 (first sentence of paragraph 3) should be deleted—
it’s redundant with the last sentence in the previous paragraph.
7. P. 1, line 44: faster growth does not necessarily imply earlier maturity—faster growth
may mean maturity occurs at a larger size if maturity is principally determined by age,
not size.
8. Eq. 2.4: the second “P” should be “1-P”.
9. I think the term “reduced model” (p. 6, line 10) is incorrectly applied here to the “model
with a SAM estimate from a given area”, although I may be misinterpreting what was
done. My interpretation is that a model for area-specific SAMs was fit (incorrectly
referred to as the “reduced model”) and compared, via a likelihood ratio test, with a
model for a single (non area-specific) SAM (incorrectly referred to as the “full model”)—
if this interpretation is correct, the “reduced model” in the terms of likelihood ratios is
actually the model with the fewer number of fitted parameters (i.e., non area-specific
model).
10. Eq. 2.10: X’s should be lower case.

Responses to Reviewer Comments
1) Data is on the DataDryad website and was uploaded using the journal integration feature which links
it to my original manuscript submission. I checked this via the link provided from the editors and
DataDryad verified that RSOS171801 had a data repository linked to it. If there is still an issue accessing
the data please let me know and I will re-upload the data and publish it without using the integrated
journal feature. It is important to note that latitude and longitude data is excluded from the data
repository since locations reflect specific locations of commercial fishery harvest and is thus
confidential.
2) The new Fig 2 in the manuscript displays male SMM estimates for all 7 management areas which
shows the piece-wise linear regression fit and scatter plot of the data from the piecewise.linear function
from the SizeR package. The dotted line in each figure represents the estimated CL for SMM.
3) Reference to “50% SMM” has been removed from manuscript and male maturity estimates are now
referred to as size at morphometric maturity or SMM.
4) An example R script is posted via DataDryad on how male SMM is calculated via the piecewise-linear
function in the package SizeR.
5) Adjusting the source code for the function piecewise.linear in the SiZer package was explored to be
able to adjust the function to bootstrap on the residuals rather than on the observed samples in R.
Unfortunately, being able to adjust the script to resample on the residuals could not be done and is
beyond the author’s ability to correctly adjust and possible re-write the function. Therefore, the sampling
bias based on the bootstrapping procedure was added in the discussion per the reviewer’s comments.
6) Table 7 which displayed the historical harvest of GKC and the impact of changing legal size for given
management areas has now been moved to the results with appropriate methods mentioned. Previously
this table was in the Discussion section.
7) Table 3 which displays the results from the SMM and SAM analyses has years associated with sample
sizes to show that sampling effort was variable from year to year and was contingent on whether
observers were able to get out sampling on a fishing boat, hence the reasoning why temporal variability
in maturity estimates was not feasible, which is mentioned in the Discussion.
8) In reference to the reviewers comment as to why CL is used as the biological measurement vs CW,
which used in the commercial fishery. For king crab species, CL is utilized as it is a more consistent less
variable measurement since biologists use calipers that can easily fit into the right eye socket slot and
measure to the back center of the carapace, where the commercial fishery uses “crab sticks” that are a
pre-determined length that are much thicker than a caliper and are designed to fit the legal CW size and
enable quick sorting of crab and reduce handling time.
9) In response to the reviewer’s comments in regards to providing assumption test results before
pursuing ANOVA analyses and post-hoc tests.
a. For GAK1 temperature analysis the ANOVA conducted was in fact a one-way ANOVA and not a
repeated measures ANOVA, this was a typo. The data met the assumptions of normality (QQ-Plot and
Shaprio-Wilk test) and homogeneity of variances (Bartlett Test).
b. For GAK1 and pooled SEAK temperatures by month this analysis was conducted a two-way ANOVA
and not a repeated measures version due to the pooling of the data by month and separated by location.
The interaction effects originally reported had a typo in the R code and have now been updated (i.e.
aov(Temp ~ Location + Month + Location:Month, data = GAK1vsSEAK), where there was still a
significant interaction between month and location , but the only significant difference between GAK1
and SEAK occurred in February which is reflected in Fig 7. The data met the assumptions of normality
(QQ-plot and Shapiro-Wilk test) and homogeneity of variances (Levene’s test).
c. For spine contribution to legal size running assumption test revealed that using the difference
between CW and CW without spines to estimate spine length caused violations of normality and
homogeneity of variances. A visual analysis using a QQ-plot for spine lengths revealed a stair/gap
pattern due to the roundness/discreteness of the data. However, the spine length data did have a
normal distribution/bell shaped curve. Therefore, due to the violations and the stair pattern in the QQ-
plot spine contributions among areas were compared using the standard deviations of the means. The
author did search out non-parametric tests to apply to the spine data (i.e. Welch test and K-W test),
however, due to the gapping pattern in the data these tests could not be utilized. Due to the complexity
of the issues mentioned and the author’s statistical knowledge spine contribution to legal size is
presented as a mean and standard deviation for each area.
