The topic of this paper is very distinctive and I’m personally interested in it. In this paper, the
authors have done a meaningful work about EGR system design and performance test, and an
optimal EGR decision-making optimization method based on grey correlation coefficient
modified is firstly proposed. The case studies have illustrated that the venture tube EGR system
achieve good results and the method proposed by the authors can effectively solve the EGR
performance evaluation problem, which has great potential application value for EGR
performance optimization and diesel engine performance improvement. In general, the
manuscript is well organized and I recommend to be accepted after minor revised. There are
some comments on your paper after review:
1. The written English is suggested to be modified to avoid grammatical errors.
2. The authors need to add the measurement precision of the test instrument, and it is suggest to
check the manuscript carefully to avoid spelling mistakes such as ‘NOX’.
3. The method proposed by the authors is rarely used in diesel engine field and can solve the
practical problem of performance optimization, the final result also proves the feasibility of the
method. If it can be extended to the performance optimization of automobile engine, the practical
value of the method will be greatly improved.

Appendix A
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers' comments concerning my manuscript entitled
" Experimental study on diesel engine EGR performance and Optimum EGR Rate
Determination Method "(ID: RSOS-181907).
I am very grateful to your valuable advice and the comments are all helpful for revising and
improving my paper, as well as the important guiding significance to my researches. I have studied
comments carefully and have made correction which we hope meet with approval. Revised portion
are marked in red in the paper. The main corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s
comments are as flowing:
Reviewer #1
Comment #1: The written English is suggested to be modified to avoid grammatical errors..
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
I am very sorry for my incorrect writing and the written English is modified carefully by an
expert.
Comment #2: The authors need to add the measurement precision of the test instrument,
and it is suggest to check the manuscript carefully to avoid spelling mistakes such as ‘NOX’..
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
The measurement precision of the test instrument has been added and the spelling mistakes has
been modified carefully.
Comment #3: The method proposed by the authors is rarely used in diesel engine field and
can solve the practical problem of performance optimization, the final result also proves the
feasibility of the method. If it can be extended to the performance optimization of automobile
engine, the practical value of the method will be greatly improved.
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
First of all, I agree with the expert's opinion. However, due to the different characteristics of
EGR requirements for vehicle engines and marine engines and the method in this paper is based on
test data. If it is required to be applied to a vehicle engine, it is necessary to provide test data for the
vehicle engine, while this paper is mainly for marine engines. Since there is no test data for the
vehicle engine, there is no way to implement it currently. However, I believe that the research
ideas in this paper can provide a certain reference for vehicle engines.
Reviewer #2
Comment #1: The authors should explain in detail the design of Venturi Tube EGR System
with calculations, citing the references.
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments. The design and calculation of Venturi Tube EGR
System has been explained as follows:
The main parameters that affecting the performance of the venturi are the throat area and the
cone angle of the diffuser. The throat area determines the ejector capacity of the venture and the
cone angle of the diffuser determines the recovery of the gas pressure after mixing. To simplify the
calculation, the flow is considered to be a constant flow situation, and the gas dynamics formula is
applied[23]:
Equation of state for ideal gas: p=<U+F072> RT
(1)
Flow continuous equation m=<U+F072> Av
(2)
Intake sound velocity equation a = <U+F067> RT
(3)
v
Mach number calculation equation M<U+F03D>

(4)
Where p ——intake pressure, MPa.
<U+F072> ——intake density, kg/m3.
R ——gas constant, J/ <U+F028> kg K <U+F029> .
T ——the absolute temperature of the intake air, K .
m ——intake air mass flow, kg/s .
A ——pipe cross-sectional area, m 2 .
v ——intake air flow rate, m/s ;
a ——local speed of sound, m/s .
<U+F067> ——specific heat ratio.
M ——Mach number.
In this paper, the rated working condition of diesel engine (1800r/min, 444kW) was selected
as the venturi tube design condition. The selection of this operating point is based on the following
considerations: The flow in the pipe is simplified to constant flow, when the diesel engine is working
in the design working condition and the opening degree of the EGR valve is adjusted from fully
closed to fully open, the venturi can be started. By the action of the pressure-reducing ejector, the
EGR rate required can be achieved, and when the EGR valve is fully opened, the throat portion of
the venturi tube will not occluded. Due to the limitation of the original machine structure, the
medium-cold high-pressure exhaust gas circulation system is selected in this test.
The basic boundary conditions are determined as follows::the diameter of the inlet and outlet
of the venturi tube should be equal to the diameter of the intake pipe d1 = d 2 =115mm,the air
pressure at the outlet of the compressor p1 =0.157MPa,the temperature T1 =345K,the flow rate
of the intake air m1 =0.529kg/s,the pressure of the exhaust gas before the turbine p2 =0.15 MPa,
According to the gas dynamics equation, it can be calculated:
= 1.57 <U+F0B4>10 =1.5854 kg/m3 ;

Mach number: M <U+F03D> v1 = 32.124 =0.08627 ;

According to the Mach number, linear interpolation is used to check the gas dynamic function
table:
A1 p1 d<U+F02A> =44mm
=6.7598 =0.9948
A<U+F02A> p0
Where: A<U+F02A> ——critical section area,m3; p0 ——stagnation pressure,MPa<U+3002>
The magnitude of the pre-turbine exhaust pressure determines the design value of the venturi
throat pressure. In order to achieve a good ejector effect, it is necessary to form a certain pressure
difference between the exhaust pipe and the throat portion of the venturi. According to empirical
data, a pressure of 3 to 10 KPa is generally required[24] , as a result:
pt = <U+F028> 0.15-0.01<U+F029> <U+F0B4>106 =0.14Mpa
p1 0.157
= =1.1214
pt 0.14
pt p /p 0.9948
= 1 0= =0.8871
p0 p1/pt 0.1214
According to the Mach number, linear interpolation is used to check the gas dynamic function
table:
At

A<U+F02A>
At A1 At / A<U+F02A> 1.5372

<U+F070> /4 <U+F070> /4 A1 / Acr 6.7598
Therefore, the design meets the requirements. After determining the throat area, the nozzle
length of the venturi L1 , the length of the mixing section Lt and the length of the diffuser L2 are
determined according to the empirical formula. In order to balance the space arrangement of the
test bench, the selection of the total length L must be feasible.
In this test, the shrinkage cone angle <U+F061> =24°which meet the empirical value 10<U+F0B0><<U+F061> <40<U+F0B0> .
d1 -dt 0.115-0.05484
L1 = = =0.1415m=141.5mm
2tg <U+F028><U+F061> /2 <U+F029> 2tg12<U+F0B0>
Considering the overall size layout of the test bench ,set L =441.5mm, Lt =50mm
L2 =L <U+F02D> L1 <U+F02D> Lt <U+F03D> 400 <U+F02D> 141.5 <U+F02D> 50 <U+F03D> 245mm
Therefore, the diffuser angle:
d1 -dt 0.115-0.05484
<U+F062> =2arctan =2arctan =14<U+F0B0>
2 <U+F0B4> L2 2 <U+F0B4> 245
According to experience, the diffuser angle <U+F062> should be within the range 11<U+F0B0><<U+F062> <18<U+F0B0> [25],
so the designed diffuser section meets the requirements. The total calculated parameters are shown
in table 2.
