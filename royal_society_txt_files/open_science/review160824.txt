The paper ‘Changeable camouflage: how well can flounder resemble the colour and spatial scale
of substrates in their natural habitats?’ presents interesting and novel data, is technically sound
and well written. The authors suggest a novel method of calculating the quality of camouflage.
Specific comments
1. XY chromatic diagram. The XYZ colour space does not show the discriminabitly of
colours. I suggest either to replace it by Luv or Lab diagrams or present data in the McLeod
Boynton diagram or use the diagrams used in aniamls research (X1, X2 or Maxwell triangle).
2. While the spread of spectra is shown in Human chromatic diagram, colours in chromatic
diagrams for animals are not shown. Please add the spread of spectra in chromatic diagrams for
animals using ether X1 X2 space as described in Kelber et al or using Maxwell triangle (or a line
in the case of crab). Also, the present the distributions of lightness (all these date can be shown in
Fig 5 to complement human chromatic diagram).
3. I am confused by the scale on axes for DS and DL plots (figures 6,7). The median values
are around 0.01. If the data are given in JND then 1 JND corresponds to threshold. This
demonstrates that all spectra are virtually the same in colour and brightness. The same applies to
the angle between spectra (fig 3). I suspect that there is a mistake in plotting.
4. Figure 2. The spectral sensitivities are not normalised to 1 at the maximum. Please either
explain the reason or normalise to 1. How were the intraocular filtering and selfscreening
accounted for?
5. It would be interesting to compare the results based on physical similarity of spectra and
difference in colour as viewed through the eyes of different animals. Also, since you calculated
the human appearance of colour it would be interesting to add the same analysis for human eyes.
6. Discussion is focussed on hyprerspectral imaging, which is not related to the topic of this
paper. I think it would be more relevant to discuss the results and the method used. For
example, does the colour vision of trichromatic fish helps to break camouflage? If fish better
camouflaged for fish eyes than for our eyes?
7. Statistics. The null hypothesis states that the two distributions are equal, i.e. the data
come from the same population. Standard statistical tests reject the null hypothesis, when the
probability of null hypothesis being correct is less than 5%. Therefore the null hypothesis cannot
be accepted if it is not rejected. I did not understand the logic behind proving that the two
distributions are not different. I think that this method can statistically prove that camouflage
can be broken but cannot show that camouflage is good. To demonstrate that camouflage is good
you need to demonstrate that the difference between distributions is less than a certain criterion.
This criterion should not depend on the sample size.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors present a small study of flounder camouflage, specifically background matching in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. They apply both abiotic (spectral angle mapper) and
biologically relevant (predator/prey visual modeling) metrics to color matching, and apply a
spatial analysis metric that has been utilized in other systems.
The paper has promise and I would like to see it as a contribution to the field, however I have
several concerns as it currently stands, most of which can be addressed with simple revision and
others that are more serious. The more serious issues give the manuscript an overall feeling that it
is preliminary work and more rigorous technique and larger sample size are required before
publication. That said, however, this study does advance flatfish camouflage research by
applying objective spectral/spatial techniques (specifically reflectance measurements and visual
modeling) which has been somewhat lacking. The authors test the observed camouflage abilities
of their subjects against theoretically “ideal” matches, which is interesting and likely to be useful
to other researchers. The visual modeling must be improved, which can be achieved relatively
simply (specific comments below).
More seriously, while I recognize the difficulty in obtaining and working with animals, the
sample size of 3 individuals per species is extremely small. This is particularly true given the
acknowledged variability in camouflage ability between individuals of the same species.
During the course of the experiments, the authors utilized laboratory fluorescent lighting,
supplemented by outdoor light from large windows. Fluorescent lighting is not spectrally
smooth. It produces such large, narrow-band radiance peaks that it is completely useless for
reflectance measurements. While the supplemental outdoor illumination may have been enough
to overcome this, I would be concerned that it might impart artifacts into the reflectance data. I
would need to see an irradiance spectrum, i.e. a Spectralon reference spectrum taken within the
tank to be convinced that the light source was adequate. The noisy reflectance spectra the authors
report (which could be smoothed with a boxcar or Savitzky-Golay), particularly in the blue,
seems indicative of low illumination. Further, fluorescent lighting will not necessarily be
perceived by flounder as natural lighting would. Since the flounder albedo response is dependent
on the ambient light field, this represents a large unknown in the methodology.
Specific Comments – line numbers may be incorrect as they did not align with text in the pdf
Pg3ln8: in the marine environment, crabs have also been well studied for camouflage and color
change, especially fiddler crabs.
Pg3ln24: how are the other classes of pigment cells controlled?
4
Pg5ln1: reports are varied, but not necessarily conflicting since they come from different groups,
and they describe a gradient of response.
Pg6ln37: emphasize that this study is novel in flatfish research
Pg6ln56: what does this size range mean in terms of growth stage? Particularly important since
camouflage ability may change with fish development
Pg7ln10: what was the color/substrate of the tank? How long did regular feeding take to occur?
Pg9ln15: what was the reflectance value of the spectralon? Were measurements taken underwater
in the same place that the flounder would be measured?
Pg10ln29: CIE chromaticity and human visual perception may be interesting, but they are not
relevant to the flounder from an evolutionary perspective. This aspect of data processing could
likely be left out without harming the paper.
Pg12 – modeling: more details of your modeling might help some readers, though the equations
have been well described elsewhere and may not be necessary here. The Weber fraction used
(0.05) is generally accepted, but citations justifying this should be added. The von-kries coefficient
should be better described. What illumination spectrum was used? Laboratory illumination
would be irrelevant, a naturalistic spectrum could be easily measured or modeled and should be
used. The figure with sensitivity spectra should be referenced here.
Pg12ln39: There is additional literature justifying the threshold of 1 JND that can be cited.
Pg14ln1: the approach you take is certainly useful, not convinced it is “more objective and
repeatable.”
Pg16ln21: describe the reflectance matching more fully. What wavelengths were closest? Are
there any spectral regions or features which may be important to discrimination by
predator/prey sensitive to it?
Pg17: the paragraph describing figures 6 and 7 should be woven into the following chapters.
Better to describe the results and reference figures than describe figures.
Discussion – good comparison of HSI/fiber optics and the limits/strengths, possible mixed use.
Add a comment about water types and transmission of reflected light through the water column
to observer. Your results represent a close-up “worse-case scenario” for flounder matching and
they might be doing an even better job in natural water. The water column has been ignored in
this treatment.
Pg19ln15: not just live in same habitat, but put evolutionary pressure on flounder to evolve
matching
Pg23ln39: true spectral resolution of USB2000 is listed as lower, I believe it’s interpolated to the
reported interval but this should be checked. Hyperspectral imagers with far better resolution
than the ones listed here are commercially available AND IN USE for camouflage research, see
Chiao et al. 2011 or Russell and Dierssen 2015. Also, imagers typically require higher levels of
illumination (lower signal to noise) which strengthens your point.
Figures: Axis labels/demarcations are generally far too small to read, and not always uniform.
Box plots seem to run over the x axis in some places. Greyscale values of “theoretical” boxes are
too light to properly view.

would like to thank this reviewer for the constructive comments. We have carefully incorporated all

XY chromatic diagram. The XYZ colour space does not show the discriminabitly of colours. I suggest either
eplace it by Luv or Lab diagrams or present data in the McLeod Boynton diagram or use the diagrams used in
mls research (X1, X2 or Maxwell triangle).
thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have taken the advice and have have replaced the CIE chromaticity
ram with a Maxwell triangle drawn for the peak wavelengths of the human visual system (now Figure 5), and
updated the corresponding parts in text.
While the spread of spectra is shown in Human chromatic diagram, colours in chromatic diagrams for
mals are not shown. Please add the spread of spectra in chromatic diagrams for animals using ether X1 X2
e as described in Kelber et al or using Maxwell triangle (or a line in the case of crab).
thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now added these diagrams to Fig 5.
, the present the distributions of lightness (all these date can be shown in Fig 5 to complement human
matic diagram).
nk you for this suggestion. For lightness, we have used the relative quantum catch (magnitude arbitrary) long-
elength receptor of each animal and plotted their distribution in Fig. 5. We have overlaid these data for both
ies on the same distribution for easy comparison.
I am confused by the scale on axes for DS and DL plots (figures 6,7). The median values are around 0.01. If
data are given in JND then 1 JND corresponds to threshold. This demonstrates that all spectra are virtually
same in colour and brightness. The same applies to the angle between spectra (fig 3). I suspect that there is
istake in plotting.
magnitudes are between 0 and 1 because we normalized the distributions for probability in each bin, by
ding by the sample size N in that bin. We had failed to mention this in the text at the time of previous
mission, but now we have updated it. We thank the reviewer for this correction.
Figure 2. The spectral sensitivities are not normalised to 1 at the maximum. Please either explain the
on or normalise to 1. How were the intraocular filtering and selfscreening accounted for?
thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have normalized the figures to 1 at the maximum.
did not include ocular media spectral transmission properties in our equations. We are not aware of published
on ocular media transmission properties for the model species we used, although we agree that this is a good
t and, for completeness of this type of modelling, all researchers should probably take this into consideration.
ever, regarding our study, including ocular media data into our analysis would most certainly not change the
ome of our analysis. The ocular media transmission data that have been published (see e.g., Siebeck &
shall 2000) show that light in the visible part of the spectrum is transmitted well; whether UV light is
smitted is species dependent. If ocular media transmission data were to affect our analysis, this would have
n notable only in the UV part of the spectrum. In our analysis, we did not include UV wavelengths because UV
was not available in the experimental setup. Therefore, we deem it safe not to include ocular media
smission data.
It would be interesting to compare the results based on physical similarity of spectra and difference in
ur as viewed through the eyes of different animals. Also, since you calculated the human appearance of
ur it would be interesting to add the same analysis for human eyes.
this would certainly be interesting. However, given the extent of the analysis to this point, we would rather
to leave this type of analysis for a different paper.
Discussion is focussed on hyprerspectral imaging, which is not related to the topic of this paper. I think it
ld be more relevant to discuss the results and the method used. For example, does the colour vision of
romatic fish helps to break camouflage? If fish better camouflaged for fish eyes than for our eyes?
nk you for this suggestion. The reason for discussing our method in relation to HSI is that this is currently the
d in the field of animal camouflage and we felt that an objective comparison of the two methods, highlighting
articular the advantages of using spectrometers, was a valuable contribution. Furthermore, we know that
eagues are currently working on camouflage of one of the flounder species we used, and are applying HSI
niques, so our study paves the way for such future publications. We are particularly keen to keep this part of
discussion in the manuscript (another reviewer also liked it).
have also added another sentence in the discussion to point out that yes, according to our data analysis, colour
n DOES help break camouflage; however, as previously mentioned in the discussion, the statistical results have
e taken with caution. Also, as requested by another reviewer, we have added a section on water quality, which
so an important consideration for overall detectability. Most likely, the flounder are even better camouflaged
ature, compared to our dataset, which was taken at a distance of 1cm, which is not a realistic distance from
ch an observer would see a flounder.
thermore, while our data analysis may suggest that colour vision is more likely to help break flounder
ouflage, we need to consider these statistical criteria before we can be confident that this is truly the case, and
a statement should certainly not be generalized. “
Statistics. The null hypothesis states that the two distributions are equal, i.e. the data come from the
e population. Standard statistical tests reject the null hypothesis, when the probability of null hypothesis
g correct is less than 5%. Therefore the null hypothesis cannot be accepted if it is not rejected. I did not
erstand the logic behind proving that the two distributions are not different. I think that this method can
istically prove that camouflage can be broken but cannot show that camouflage is good. To demonstrate
camouflage is good you need to demonstrate that the difference between distributions is less than a
ain criterion. This criterion should not depend on the sample size.
are confused by this comment from our reviewer. Our intention in testing whether the “ideal” and “actual”
ributions of DL and DS were similar or not was to see if the animal’s colors could have been a subset of those
the background (in the eye of the relevant observer). We did not intend to analyze how good the animal’s
ouflage was, rather, whether most of the colors on the animal were discriminable from the background or not.
intended to explain in Fig. 9 that even if the animal and background show chromatic similarities, simple
rangement of the background can expose the animal, indicating “bad” camouflage.

authors present a small study of flounder camouflage, specifically background matching in both spectral and
ial dimensions. They apply both abiotic (spectral angle mapper) and biologically relevant (predator/prey
al modeling) metrics to color matching, and apply a spatial analysis metric that has been utilized in other
ems.
paper has promise and I would like to see it as a contribution to the field, however I have several concerns
currently stands, most of which can be addressed with simple revision and others that are more serious.
more serious issues give the manuscript an overall feeling that it is preliminary work and more rigorous
nique and larger sample size are required before publication. That said, however, this study does advance
ish camouflage research by applying objective spectral/spatial techniques (specifically reflectance
surements and visual modeling) which has been somewhat lacking. The authors test the observed
ouflage abilities of their subjects against theoretically “ideal” matches, which is interesting and likely to be
ul to other researchers. The visual modeling must be improved, which can be achieved relatively simply
cific comments below).
e seriously, while I recognize the difficulty in obtaining and working with animals, the sample size of 3
viduals per species is extremely small. This is particularly true given the acknowledged variability in
ouflage ability between individuals of the same species.
would like to thank the reviewer for the constructive comments. We have followed all of the reviewer’s
estions in the revised manuscript. Specific actions are described below.
arding this reviewer’s most serious concern of sample size, we recognize, that a sample size of 3 appears small
ny scientific endeavor; however, we would like to clarify this point (and we have also clarified this in the
uscript). Previously, we stated in the manuscript, that the fish “(…) spectra show considerable variation (…)”
ted previously on p16, line 32). Understandably, the reviewer criticizes that a sample size of 3 cannot fully
ribe these variations and that a larger sample size is needed. Our statement needs clarification. All individuals
particular species have a particular phenotype (excluding mutations here). Specific to the flounder we worked
, they all have the four specific body areas that we recognized and described in our manuscript. These specific
y areas are composed of the same types of pigments and reflector cells, making the individuals of each species
the same, and the measured spectra are also the same. The “white spots” on individual A do not look or
sure differently compared to the “white spots” on individual B, etc. The same is true for the other body areas.
body pattern response that we measured appears to be elicited solely by background; there is no apparent
itional control mechanism in these fish (not like cuttlefish). In cuttlefish, body pattern can change for a series of
ons – camouflage is not the only reason; and cuttlefish changes are fast – yet, their changes are restricted
in specific body regions. Like cuttlefish, flounder cannot randomly change colour or pattern whenever and
ever they want, and changes are restricted to the four specific body regions described in our paper. What
ds to be clarified for this reviewer, and has been clarified in the manuscript for future readers, is that the
iation” we talk about is really the range of observed spectra for all body areas. We plot all four areas in one
(Figs 2 and 3), and this obviously results in a plot that shows a wide range of colours, which could be mis-
rpreted as “variation”, when in actual fact, it shows the range of colours that are seen across the entire fish;
this range is observed on each fish. Importantly, there is no individual spectral variation to a given background;
e spots are white on all fish, black spots are black on all fish. To clarify this in the manuscript, we have added a
ion to the first paragraph of the results.
is the main reason for why we chose to take three individuals for each species. Increasing the sample size
ld not have changed the outcome of this study.
size was another reason for why we were only able to use three individuals per species. We wanted fish that
e the same size, and not all fish available to us at the time fit into the same size category. The last reason was
e constraint. These are large fish that need large holding tanks. To keep track of individual fish for the duration
n experiment, fish need to be kept individually in sufficiently large tanks, which poses a space (and financial)
lenge. For behavioural work of any complexity (which we did not consider our experiment to be), there are of
rse ways to overcome these challenges, but our study falls more under the category of “descriptive anatomy”
“behaviour”; thus, we deemed 3 individuals sufficient.
ing the course of the experiments, the authors utilized laboratory fluorescent lighting, supplemented by
door light from large windows. Fluorescent lighting is not spectrally smooth. It produces such large, narrow-
d radiance peaks that it is completely useless for reflectance measurements. While the supplemental
door illumination may have been enough to overcome this, I would be concerned that it might impart
acts into the reflectance data. I would need to see an irradiance spectrum, i.e. a Spectralon reference
ctrum taken within the tank to be convinced that the light source was adequate. The noisy reflectance
ctra the authors report (which could be smoothed with a boxcar or Savitzky-Golay), particularly in the blue,
ms indicative of low illumination. Further, fluorescent lighting will not necessarily be perceived by flounder
atural lighting would. Since the flounder albedo response is dependent on the ambient light field, this
esents a large unknown in the methodology.
respective sentence in the methods should have been stated the other way around. The holding and
erimental tanks were situated in an alcove surrounded by large windows, eight windows in total, five windows
e-by (approx.. 3m), three windows at the periphery, each about 3m by 3m in size. The majority of the
ination was from natural daylight coming through those windows. The light field was supplemented by one
or fluorescent ceiling light, which was situated equidistant to one of the windows (a small double tube 1.5m
ng light, which made extremely little difference; at midday, the USB2000 was unable to detect whether this
rescent light was turned on or off). Due to the windows, the usable waveband of our dataset was restricted to
-700nm. Below 400nm and above 700nm, data were too noisy. The below graph shows a Spectralon
surement taken in the tank. The image below is a panoramic shot of the surrounding windows, taken from the
tion of the experimental tank. Note that the fluorescent light that supplemented the light field for our
eriment can be seen in the top left of the images. Three other fluorescent lights can be seen in the distance,
too far to contribute to the light field at the tank.

n8: in the marine environment, crabs have also been well studied for camouflage and color change,
ecially fiddler crabs.
nk you for pointing this out – we added crabs to the list, as well as Hemmi et al 2006 (fiddler crab) and Stuart-
& Moussalli 2009 (review).

n24: how are the other classes of pigment cells controlled?
nk you for pointing out missing information. We reworded that sentence to read:
anophores, as well as xanthophores and erythrophores, are predominantly under neural control, so that the
tive visibility of these darker chromatophores that overlay chromatophores of lighter shades determines the
earance of a flatfish (Scott, 1965; Lanzing, 1977; Burton, 2002).
n1: reports are varied, but not necessarily conflicting since they come from different groups, and they
cribe a gradient of response.
nk you – we changed it to “varied” instead of “conflicting”. The sentence now reads:
re are varying reports in the literature regarding the time it takes for a flatfish to change its
our or pattern; and these times are likely to be species-specific.
n37: emphasize that this study is novel in flatfish research
nk you – we did. Sentence now reads:
restingly, the question of whether flatfish match backgrounds spectrally and spatially has not
n addressed quantitatively, and our objective was to fill this gap in knowledge.
n56: what does this size range mean in terms of growth stage? Particularly important since camouflage
ty may change with fish development
three individuals for each species were the same size, so there was no size range. However, the size question is
nteresting thought – we added a sentence to this effect in the discussion.
p.21, we added:
other interesting aspect is flounder size relative to camouflage ability. We used adult animals in our study but it
ld be valuable to compare our results across other life history stages. “
n10: what was the color/substrate of the tank? How long did regular feeding take to occur?
tank was subdivided into 4 compartments using grey PVC sheets. The tank itself was a blue/green colour. The
om of the tank was covered by substrate. We added some more explanation in the manuscript.
n15: what was the reflectance value of the spectralon? Were measurements taken underwater in the same
e that the flounder would be measured?
nk you for pointing this out and sorry we forgot to state this piece of method information in the first place. Yes,
measurements were taken underwater (we added this to the methods). The spectralon was placed adjacent to
area that was being measured, and regular white balancing was done. This was particularly important, since
light field changed occasionally, because the tank was situated next to very large windows. We added the
wing sentence:
ular white balancing was done using a Diffuse Reflectance Standard (Ocean Optics, WS-1).
reflectance standard was placed adjacent to the area that was being measured, so that both
ectance standard and object of interest were in the same light field.
0ln29: CIE chromaticity and human visual perception may be interesting, but they are not relevant to the
nder from an evolutionary perspective. This aspect of data processing could likely be left out without
ming the paper.
nk you for this suggestion. We have now removed the CIE chromaticity diagram and instead used chromaticity
rams relevant for animal vision. This was also a change suggested by Reviewer 1.
2 – modeling: more details of your modeling might help some readers, though the equations have been well
cribed elsewhere and may not be necessary here. The Weber fraction used (0.05) is generally accepted, but
tions justifying this should be added. The von-kries coefficient should be better described. What illumination
ctrum was used? Laboratory illumination would be irrelevant, a naturalistic spectrum could be easily
sured or modeled and should be used. The figure with sensitivity spectra should be referenced here.
nk you for this suggestion. We are not entirely sure how we can answer: The Weber fraction of 0.05 seems to
sed by all publications we are aware of and we are not sure what the justification might be. If the reviewer has
ecific suggestion, we are most happy to include it in the manuscript. The illumination spectrum and modeling
ils are described above and have also been updated in the manuscript.
2ln39: There is additional literature justifying the threshold of 1 JND that can be cited.
have added Vorobyev et al 2001 and Lind & Kelber 2009 as examples for further literature where a JND
shold of 1 is used/discussed.
4ln1: the approach you take is certainly useful, not convinced it is “more objective and repeatable.”
have reworded this sentence: It now reads: “…we have taken a more structured approach…”.
6ln21: describe the reflectance matching more fully. What wavelengths were closest? Are there any spectral
ons or features which may be important to discrimination by predator/prey sensitive to it?
have incorporated this suggestion and included a new sentence (see below). Overall, since the spectra were all
er non-distinct broad-band (“brown”), there were no wavelengths that were closer than others. Also, the
tral regions or features that may be important for discrimination by a predator/prey, really depend on the
al system in question.
following sentence was added:
rms of wavelength, the spectra (both flounder and substrates) are broad-band, with very few distinct spectral
des. Overall, most of the spectra are a general “brown” shade (specifically, the spectra with low y-axis values).
e spectra with higher y-axis values are typical for lighter tan or white objects. In Fig. 2C; D and Fig. 3C; D, the
trometer identified red rocks, which clearly stand out in the substrate spectral plots (see spectral peak in the
-650nm).
7: the paragraph describing figures 6 and 7 should be woven into the following chapters. Better to describe
results and reference figures than describe figures.
thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We tried to restructure it along the lines of what this reviewer
ested but all authors agree that the information is easiest to digest in a confined paragraph that references
figures. By working through each figure step by step, the reader is easily led through the results.
ussion – good comparison of HSI/fiber optics and the limits/strengths, possible mixed use. Add a comment
ut water types and transmission of reflected light through the water column to observer. Your results
esent a close-up “worse-case scenario” for flounder matching and they might be doing an even better job in
ural water. The water column has been ignored in this treatment.
nk you for this suggestion. We have incorporated it and written a new paragraph (p. 21):
, it should be pointed out that our spectral dataset was taken at a distance of approximately 1cm from the
nder/substrate and that it is extremely unlikely that any observer would be this close to a target. More likely, a
ator would be many centimeters, even meters, away when swimming over, or moving by a flounder
ouflaged on a substrate, thus visually taking in a much larger scene. Optical water type and turbidity also play a
or role in underwater visibility. The natural habitats of these flounder are particularly turbid near-shore waters
ov, 1976). Therefore, it is conceivable that flounder might be even better camouflaged to potential observers
eir natural habitats, where reduced visibility makes detection less likely.
ov, N. G. (1976). Marine Optics: Amsterdam: Elsevier.
9ln15: not just live in same habitat, but put evolutionary pressure on flounder to evolve matching
d point – we added it; sentence now reads:
wever, we are interested in assessing this resemblance through the eyes of biologically
vant observers that live in the same aquatic habitat, thus putting evolutionary pressure on
nder camouflage.
3ln39: true spectral resolution of USB2000 is listed as lower, I believe it’s interpolated to the reported
rval but this should be checked. Hyperspectral imagers with far better resolution than the ones listed here
commercially available AND IN USE for camouflage research, see Chiao et al. 2011 or Russell and Dierssen
5. Also, imagers typically require higher levels of illumination (lower signal to noise) which strengthens your
t.
thank the reviewer for this comment. We have clarified the point about resolution in the text.
res: Axis labels/demarcations are generally far too small to read, and not always uniform. Box plots seem to
over the x axis in some places. Greyscale values of “theoretical” boxes are too light to properly view.
nk you for pointing this out and our apologies for submitting them with such small labels in the first place. We
ld like to assure the reviewer that we will update all axes labels and fonts at the time of final submission. For
time frame of this revision (due January 2, 2017), our lead author has been away in the field with limited time
internet connection, and it has been logistically impossible to upload/send large files. Sorry to still
