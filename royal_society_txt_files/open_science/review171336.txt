The manuscript by Ward et el. presents a combination of MSIM with difference microscopy. The
authors offer no experimental data nor a mathematical model of their approach. They only show
simulated images of test patterns – however those test patterns are not ideal for resolution
estimations (a Siemens star target is preferable). The simulations are presented without
accompanying simulation parameters. As far as I can tell does the simulation software not use
physical parameters. Also, no details on the actual reconstruction algorithm are provided in the
text and the Github repository does not provide the used PSF or ground truth sample.
The authors also use ambiguous notation (“auto-cross-correlation”) or contradictory lines of
thought (line 31 “post-acquisition pattern estimation [is] less susceptible to sample-specific
aberrations”, line 36 “Post-acquisition estimation [..] can often be unstable given different
samples and aberrations”).
Also, to spare the authors unfruitful further work, I’d like to invite them to re-read their reference
[8], which introduces the concept of difference microscopy. There it is written:
“Some negative intensity values will inevitably appear in the difference image after subtraction.
We simply exclude these negative intensities from the image to improve the imaging quality”.
This is equal to stating a FWHM measured above the half maximum. This only virtually sharpens
point- and line-like images without the addition of new spatial frequencies. As every SIM method
is based on frequency mixing between the sample and pattern frequencies, it is impossible to gain
new information with this approach.
I can only recommend to reject the manuscript, but I’d like to encourage the authors to work
towards a more rigorous and detailed paper focused on their novel pattern estimation algorithm,
which might be of interest to the community.

Appendix A
It is very important to get a better resolution microscopy image with high speed, SIM
microscope has provide us a possible way, but the resolution of SIM is limit by the 2 times of
objective. How to improve the resolution of the SIM is a important subject. This paper has
used fluorescence difference method for enhancing the structure light, and then using
Fourier-Ptychography method to get higher resolution image, it is interesting. But some
point needs to be added and make the paper more clear.
1. It needs to demonstrate more detail in the principle of the imaging method, it is best
way to analysis theoretically.
2. The title of the paper “multi focal structured illumination” gives an impression of multi
distance focal, I think it is different from the author’s meaning, I think here is the
concept of multi-point, is that right?
3. Please give the analysis or experimental result of this method has better imaging speed?
4. Intensity weight is important point in this method, please give more detail on the weight
factor decision, how to decide the intensity weight?
5. Please give more detail on the improvement of artifact effect comparing with classical
SIM?
Appendix B
Reviewer 1:
The manuscript by Ward et el. presents a combination of MSIM with difference microscopy. The
authors offer no experimental data nor a mathematical model of their approach.
For simplicity and brevity we chose to minimise the mathematics of the technique, focussing on
results of simulations and possible practical implementation. Taking on board the advice given
we have now included a mathematical model of image formation and the basic SIM procedure
to show resolution improvement with excitation pattern frequency. The technique is only in its
theoretical stage and we hope that we made this recognisable in the manuscript. We have tried
to be realistic on the limitations of the simulations and how the real-world conditions may
affect this method.
They only show simulated images of test patterns – however those test patterns are not ideal for
resolution estimations (a Siemens star target is preferable).
We have now included the results on a Siemen’s star as well a graphical display of resolution
differences obtained for simple comparison. We have chosen to keep the results on the
previous resolution targets as well as they do demonstrate performance on more intuitive
structures.
The simulations are presented without accompanying simulation parameters.
We have taken this on board and have now incorporated the details of the simulation
conditions along with the results.
As far as I can tell does the simulation software not use physical parameters.
Indeed we chose to exclude physical parameters as the results were sufficiently qualitative.
Following your advice we have now included scale bars, the PSFs used are now in the repository
along with a description of their calculation and physical parameters.
Also, no details on the actual reconstruction algorithm are provided in the text and the Github
repository does not provide the used PSF or ground truth sample.
We have now included a description of simulation parameters. The PSFs used along with
resolution targets are now in the repository too.
The authors also use ambiguous notation (“auto-cross-correlation”)
We have tried to give a more detailed description of the pattern estimation process although
this has now been improved since initial submission. This is reflected in the repository and the
text.
or contradictory lines of thought (line 31 “post-acquisition pattern estimation [is] less susceptible to
sample-specific aberrations”, line 36 “Post-acquisition estimation [..] can often be unstable given
different samples and aberrations”).
This could have been described more clearly as we are in fact referring to two different things.
We have altered the text to make this more obvious.
Also, to spare the authors unfruitful further work, I’d like to invite them to re-read their reference [8],
which introduces the concept of difference microscopy. There it is written:
“Some negative intensity values will inevitably appear in the difference image after subtraction. We
simply exclude these negative intensities from the image to improve the imaging quality”.
This is equal to stating a FWHM measured above the half maximum. This only virtually sharpens point-
and line-like images without the addition of new spatial frequencies.
We respectfully wish to disagree with the reviewer over this point and we apologise if our text
(or that of reference [8 now 10]) was misleading. Difference microscopy does not increase
resolution solely though subtraction of a uniform intensity which we agree would artificially
sharpen point and line targets. We have altered our resolution target, bringing the point
sources closer together (at twice the resolution limit distance) to demonstrate that there is a
true increase in resolving power (even using pattern estimation). These results are backed up by
the intensity plot of the siemens star target showing the spokes are clearly resolved with e
MSIM and where deteriorated when using MSIM. When the authors of reference [10] refer to
ignoring negative values they are not suggesting that this is the source of the resolution
increase rather how to handle an inevitable (and meaningless) mathematical artefact. The
reasoning behind simply ignoring these values has been discussed previously by (Hewlett, S.
&Wilson, T. Resolution enhancement in three-dimensional confocal microscopy. Mach. Vis.
Appl. 4, 233–242 (1991)) where it is made apparent that no resolution increase is obtained
through this method.
As every SIM method is based on frequency mixing between the sample and pattern frequencies, it is
impossible to gain new information with this approach.
Using image subtraction to achieve super resolution is a well-tested and widely accepted
technique, forming the basis of not just 2D and 3D FED but also switching laser mode (SLAM)
microscopy and dark-beam imaging. Since no resolution improvement is obtained from the
structured illumination information in these techniques, they use pointillistic detectors (PMT or
APD) the increase in resolution in must be due to a tighter effective excitation PSF. By
definition this must therefore contain higher spatial frequencies than classically allowed.
Building on this, reference [9] details a mathematical proof (which we invite our more curious
readers to familiarise themselves with) that structured illumination information can then be
obtained from effectively reduced PSFs (which is the principle behind eMSIM).
More intuitively one could consider that the origin of the increased resolution increase in
eMSIM is in the higher spatial frequencies in the ‘doughnut’ PSFs. This is clear when you
consider that the full-width-half-minima of the doughnuts is narrower than the full-width-half-
maxima of an unmodified diffraction-limited PSF. (Such a narrow structure would be
impossible without higher spatial frequencies.) These higher spatial frequencies are transferred
into the smaller effective PSF by the subtraction.
The use of the combination of the two PSFs can be justified when considering realistic imaging
environments. Given that these doughnut beams are axially extended in comparison to regular
PSFs, using just the doughnut beams would introduce more out-of-focus light into the acquired
image and limit the use of digital pinholing. As the deconvolution method(s) are explicitly 2D,
the extra out-of-focus light in real-world conditions would likely degrade the performance. The
ability to demonstrate the improved resolution in a subtraction-based scheme also opens the
possibility to expand to 3D super-resolution based on 3D FED microscopy. This has been added
to the discussion.
I can only recommend to reject the manuscript, but I’d like to encourage the authors to work towards
a more rigorous and detailed paper focused on their novel pattern estimation algorithm, which might
be of interest to the community.
We hope the amendments have clarified our attempt to present the theoretical aspect of our
work with clear cut simulations backing our claims regarding its usability and resolution
improvement. We hope that our extensive revision now satisfies the reviewer to that extent
that he/she reconsiders the initial decision of rejection.

Edward N. Ward and his coauthors introduced a novel enhanced multi-focal structured illumination
technique. With this technique, 1.5 times increase in resolution over conventional structured
illumination could be obtained. The authors also provided some pictures with higher resolution to
validate this technique. I think this is an interesting technology and worth popularizing. While I also
think, more details about this process should be introduced.
We have included a mathematical description of the SIM/MSIM process which we hope will
provide extra detail on the origin of the increased resolution. We have also given more details
on the pattern estimation and proposed practical setup.
The device diagram should be provided in the manuscript to make more researchers understand and
use this new technology. So, the authors should provide the detail experiment process for the
potential readers who are interested in the new technique.
We have now included a model diagram for the layout needed for the necessary pattern
projection. We hope in the future to include hologram calculation and control software for the
equipment in the repository.
Additionally, the authors also should provide the scale bar in the Fig 1, Fig 2 and Fig 3. With this scale
bar, the readers could get a more intuitive feel for the higher resolution technique.
We have now include scale bars on the diagrams and included in the text the physical
conditions simulated in the images. We have based this on wavelengths and emitters familiar to
the imaging community.
Some listed literatures maybe help you to introduce this new technology. These literatures also
introduce some new technologies, but also provided the details about the devices and experiments.

We thank the reviewer for the suggested literature. However, on consideration, we felt that the
suggested articles – which focussed mainly on the application of nano-particles with some use
of single molecule localisation – was not directly related to our technique which is aimed at
live-cell microscopy. We have however now included a comparison of SIM to PALM/STORM in
biological imaging to put our technique into better perspective.
Reviewer: 3
It is very important to get a better resolution microscopy image with high speed, SIM microscope has
provide us a possible way, but the resolution of SIM is limit by the 2 times of objective. How to
improve the resolution of the SIM is a important subject. This paper has used fluorescence
difference method for enhancing the structure light, and then using Fourier-Ptychography method
to get higher resolution image, it is interesting. But some point needs to be added and make the
paper more clear.
1. It needs to demonstrate more detail in the principle of the imaging method, it is best way to
analysis theoretically.
We have now included some of the equations describing diffraction-limited image formation
and the dependence of excitation pattern frequencies on resolution improvement.
2. The title of the paper “multi focal structured illumination” gives an impression of multi distance
focal, I think it is different from the author’s meaning, I think here is the concept of multi-point, is
that right?
Indeed, ‘multi-point’ or ‘multi-spot’ is a more logical description however we chose to stick to
‘multi-focal’ which was the original terminology first used to describe the MSIM method
(references 5, 6, 12). Since then we agree multi-focal has somewhat been redefined for multi-
plane imaging so we have followed the reviewers kind advice and altered our terminology to
‘multi-spot’.
3. Please give the analysis or experimental result of this method has better imaging speed?
Currently, since the method is only in the theoretical and (very early experimental phases) we
felt that speculating on potential imaging times might have been construed as misleading.
However we have now included what we believe to be a conservative estimate of imaging time,
primarily based on reference 5.
4. Intensity weight is important point in this method, please give more detail on the weight factor
decision, how to decide the intensity weight?
The choice of weighting is indeed important to the technique and this has now been described
in the text. We have excluded the intensity-weighted approach as this led to minimal
improvement for extra complexity. We have also justified the choice of subtraction constant
based on what would be most likely in biological imaging.
5. Please give more detail on the improvement of artefact effect comparing with classical SIM?
Following the advice of reviewer 1 we have removed the filaments test target and comparison
of artefacts in favour of analysis of siemens star target and close point sources.
We hope that we have addressed all points raised by our reviewers at full extent and by
substantially increase the content and quality of our manuscript it will receive positive reception
and will be found suitable for publication.
Appendix C
Dear Editor please find our responses to reviewer No. 3 and our revised manuscript. Thank you
Response to reviewer No.3:
1) Yes we agree that correct pattern projection is vital for this method. The advantage of using
holography is that the location of the spots can be controlled very precisely and the only issue in in
maintaining a uniform brightness. We have now described this in the text along with possible solutions
and referenced an excellent paper which describes the background on the necessary hologram

2) Sorry, this was a simple typo in the referencing as you spotted. This has now been corrected and
reference No. 10 has been incorporated and cited at it’s relevant location in the text.
3) Thank you for the clarification of your feedback. We tried to avoid including images of the PSFs and
excitation patterns in the paper to focus on the results. We have now included a more detailed
description of these excitation patterns, addressing spot size, pattern spacing, shift number and
contrast as suggested. Since some readers may already have the necessary equipment to implement
this technique on their own systems we have also expanded the documentation on the repository to
give more detail on how readers can calculate their own PSFs and simulate images with characteristics
in line with any setups they might already have.
