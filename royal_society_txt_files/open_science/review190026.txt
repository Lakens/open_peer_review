The authors used a land cover change model to simulate future broadleaf expansion in Wales
under two scenarios. I found the paper very interesting to read and very well done. I have only
some minor suggestions before recommending it to publication. In detail:
- line 89: I would argue against using the word "predict" when it comes to modeling future land
cover change. In reality these models can "project", but not really "predict" as they are blind to
antecipate several socio-economic dynamics that surely impact future land cover change (e.g.
predicting the impact of Brexit). Also, it would be important to add a sentence to the
introduction on how these models assume that the relationships found between the explanatory
variables and the observed change remains stable over time, which is also not the case in real life
(socio-economic dynamics tend to vary over time, e.g. dietary changes vary over time leading to
different impacts on land use dynamics; focus on restoration may increase due to policy changes).
- line 105: I would also argue that these models are not necessarily providing a "high level of
accuracy". It depends on how these are (usually poorly) validated. If you compare projected with
observed and considered all the landscape, surely the accuracy is high because 90% of the
landscape doesn't change. If you compare observed and predicted CHANGE, then their accuracy
is quite low actually (see, for example, Rosa et al. 2014 Global Change Biology.
- I was surprised that the authors did not attempt to test the correlation between the explanatory
variables. Surely, Distance to Access Points and Distance from Roads are correlated variables. Is
this not the case?
- line 222: I would recommend avoiding qualitative statements such as "fairly well", because to
me, a 50% accuracy is not a good accuracy. Also, given that you know how well these variables
explain the different transitions, why not just focus on the good ones to project the future? Or
better yet, why not use the quality of the model (% accuracy) to weigh the projections? It seems a
bit odd to me that then the authors mix the results of really good and bad models in the same
map...
- It was also not clear to me how the authors converted the transition probabilities to an actual
change in area (Figure 2). It would be important to clarify that under section 2.2.5. Was the
highest transition probability in each pixel chosen to be the one projected to occur?
- line 295: where does the 79% accuracy come from? Is it the average of all models? If so, please
add the standard error as well
- in Figure 1b, it is not clear to me why there is such a big difference between the BAU scenario
and the historical changes in Improved Grassland... shouldn't it be relatively similar? Since BAU
is an extrapolation of the historical trends.
- It's almost impossible to visualize anything in Figure 3... I would consider removing this figure
as it doesn't seem to add much to the main messages of the manuscript. Or replace it by another
type of visualization highlighting the main message, i.e. the areas where you historically had
broadleaf expansion and not necessarily the same as those projected to occur in the future. Or
combine existing figure with Figure 4, by placing the projected change (in black) on top off the
potential for change.
- Figure 4 - is this displaying the rate of conversion (more area) or the potential for conversion
(higher probability). It is unclear to me at the moment.
- I know it is a bit the "elephant in the room", but perhaps it would make sense to at least mention
Brexit in the Discussion of the paper, and how its uncertainty might impact the British landscape.
Further, it would highlight the useful characteristics of scenario modeling and scenario analysis
for dealing with uncertainties such as those associated with Brexit.

Overview:
The submitted manuscript describes an alternative futures scenario modeling study designed to
understand how broadleaf forests and other natural ecosystems in Wales will change under
different policy scenarios. The authors evaluate two scenarios, “business as usual” and a
conservation scenario. The results of the modeling show that Broadleaf forests in Wales are likely
to increase at a greater rate under the conservation scenario due to increased Conifer-to-Broadleaf
conversion and reduced levels of Broadleaf loss. The results of the modeling yield a range of
insights about the expected future distribution of future forest and grassland ecosystems,
including that the current rate of forest expansion will meet current policy goals. The results of
this study also provide a dataset that can be used to better understand expected future changes in
related ecosystem services and biodiversity. The authors also highlight the seriousness of loss
with respect to bog ecosystems and that new policy-based effort is needed urgently to address
this situation. Notwithstanding the potential concerns discussed below, the future scenarios are
well constructed and empirically rigorous. In particular, the variable selection process is robust
and the accuracy assessment scores and process are sound. Also, the academic writing is strong
and the background information and description of the modeling processes undertaken are well
described.
Concerns/Suggestions:
My main concern is that the conservation scenario assumes that Broadleaf conversion will stop,
but it is not stated how this would take place in terms of existing or expected policies.
Specifically, the authors note there is a public policy goal to increase Broadleaf forest cover and a
4
general aspiration in support of this goal, but nothing is said about a parallel goal or aspiration to
decrease Broadleaf forest loss. This model assumption can theoretically be acceptable, but adding
to my confusion is how the authors expect this outcome to occur because related policy proposals
or findings are not addressed in the scenario assumptions of the conservation model or in the
discussion, where potential Broadleaf expansion policies are discussed, such as decreased
harvesting rotations to accelerate the conversion of Conifer forests to Broadleaf forests.
All told, given that the rate of Broadleaf loss was significant 2007-2015, more attention should be
given to (a) justifying how no new Broadleaf loss would occur through 2030 from a policy
perspective and/or (b) offering recommendations based on this research or other research that
indicates how ending the historic drivers of Broadleaf conversion can be achieved. In the absence
of discussing either of these elements, the proposed conservation future scenario appears
unlikely to be achievable and thus the model’s results offer less value and accuracy than would
be true otherwise.
The second item of concern is that the description of the assumption for the conservation
transition probability for ‘Mountain, Heath and Bog’ appears to be cut off (Page 9 line 254). This
means the adjustments made to the related transition probabilities in Table 2 cannot be fully
understood or verified.
The last item of note is that some LULC categories and transitions were excluded because they
were “not relevant to our objectives (e.g., urban areas).” I presume that urbanization was a factor
in driving historic Broadleaf forest loss. Either way, this paper could be improved in supporting
its policy recommendations by better describing the causes of ecosystem conversion historically
and by offering more discussion about how these factors could/would be mitigated in the
conservation scenario, especially given the conservation scenario assumption of no net Broadleaf
forest loss. Also, if there was no significant historic loss of ecosystems due to “Built Areas,” I
suggest noting this in the paper.

Appendix A
Reviewer 1
Comment 1: line 89: I would argue against using the word "predict" when it comes to modelling
future land cover change. In reality these models can "project", but not really "predict" as they are
blind to anticipate several socio-economic dynamics that surely impact future land cover change (e.g.
predicting the impact of Brexit). Also, it would be important to add a sentence to the introduction on
how these models assume that the relationships found between the explanatory variables and the
observed change remains stable over time, which is also not the case in real life (socio-economic
dynamics tend to vary over time, e.g. dietary changes vary over time leading to different impacts on
land use dynamics; focus on restoration may increase due to policy changes).
Response: As rightly pointed out, the difference in predict and project is important to understand.
Changes made in line 90 and in other parts of the manuscript where project is a more suitable term
in place of predict.
The point about the dynamic nature of socio-economic drivers is a very good one and we have now
highlighted this in the paper (lines 110-112). Moreover, as explained in lines 198-202, variables can
be both static and dynamic. Values of a dynamic variables change at each time step of the model
run and thus need to be recalculated (e.g. the distance from broadleaf forest as these forests
expand). By contrast, static variables remain constant over time (e.g. altitude, slope, soil type). In
Table 1, all variables are labelled as either static or dynamic.
Comment 2: line 105: I would also argue that these models are not necessarily providing a "high level
of accuracy". It depends on how these are (usually poorly) validated. If you compare projected with
observed and considered all the landscape, surely the accuracy is high because 90% of the landscape
doesn't change. If you compare observed and predicted CHANGE, then their accuracy is quite low
actually (see, for example, Rosa et al. 2014 Global Change Biology.)
Response: Changes made in line 106-107, as suggested.
Comment 3: I was surprised that the authors did not attempt to test the correlation between the
explanatory variables. Surely, Distance to Access Points and Distance from Roads are correlated
variables. Is this not the case?
Response: In this study, we used Multilayer-Perceptron (MLP) algorithm, and following the
instructions in the user manual of the Terrset software, we included all possible variables likely to
explain the past transitions and then selected the variables in two steps: In the first step, we
dropped variables of low explanatory power based on Cremer V value and in the second step the
MLP used a backwards stepwise variable selection to use the minimum number of least correlated
variables to be included in the final model (added to line 231-233 now). The second step thus
corresponds to testing the correlation between variables to reduce model overfitting. However,
could have been interesting to manually test for correlation and compare the two methods to see if
a different selection of variables would be suggested.
Comment 4: line 222: I would recommend avoiding qualitative statements such as "fairly well",
because to me, a 50% accuracy is not a good accuracy. Also, given that you know how well these
variables explain the different transitions, why not just focus on the good ones to project the future?
Or better yet, why not use the quality of the model (% accuracy) to weigh the projections? It seems a
bit odd to me that then the authors mix the results of really good and bad models in the same map...
Response: Changes made as suggested (lines 227-228). We included all possible variables likely to
explain the land use change. The Multilayer-Perceptron algorithm used a stepwise selection of
variables for each transition sub-model, retaining the most powerful variables. Therefore, instead
of selecting variables for individual land use changes, we automated this process by letting the
algorithm choose the best set of variables to explain each change.
There are 2 sub-models which failed to accurately predict some transitions (for example, broadleaf
to improved and semi-natural grasslands were predicted with an accuracy of 50%). Luckily, these
sub-models were of low importance since only a small land area changed from broadleaf forest to
these two classes (and this is actually the reason why model couldn’t predict them accurately since
only a few pixels were available for training and testing). But despite being inaccurate, we had to
include these sub-models in the final ensemble, or the model would consider no transition
between these classes. But since our main focus was on the transitions to and from broadleaf and
conifer forest, we included these sub-models in the final model.
Comment 5: It was also not clear to me how the authors converted the transition probabilities to an
actual change in area (Figure 2). It would be important to clarify that under section 2.2.5. Was the
highest transition probability in each pixel chosen to be the one projected to occur?
Response: The transition probability matrix is calculated from the transition sub models (table 1)
and this matrix is then translated into transition potential maps (supplementary data S2, Fig S3.).
The transition potential map is used to allocate land class to each pixel.
We used the Markov Chain algorithm to determine the amount of change that will occur until
2030. The Markov Chain determines the amount of change using the earlier and later landcover
maps along with the date specified. The procedure determines how much land would be expected
to transition from the later date to the prediction date based on a projection of the transition
potentials into the future and creates a transition probabilities file. The transition probabilities file
is a matrix that records the probability that each landcover category will change to every other
category.
Comment 6: line 295: where does the 79% accuracy come from? Is it the average of all models? If so,
please add the standard error as well
Response: 79% is the average of the accuracies of the sub-models of the transitions among all the
classes considered in this study (supplementary data S1, Table S2), we explain this point now in
lines 306-307.
Comment 7: In Figure 1b, it is not clear to me why there is such a big difference between the BAU
scenario and the historical changes in Improved Grassland... shouldn't it be relatively similar? Since
BAU is an extrapolation of the historical trends.
Response: This is an interesting observation. Clearly, the area gained/lost by Improved Grasslands
is much more between 2015-2030 (B.A.U) as compared to the past (2007-2015). In Wales, Improved
grassland and semi-natural grassland are the largest land use classes occupying nearly 70% of the
Welsh landscape. Between 2007-2015, the largest contribution to the expansion of improved
grassland came from the semi-natural grassland. If this trend continues (as assumed in the B.A.U
scenario) the change in the area would have the same direction (net change positive) but the
amount of change would be larger as compared to past since the period of projection is double the
time of the past analysis (the past analysis shows area gained/lost in 8 years while the future
projections show area likely to be gained/lost in next 15 years). Therefore, we would expect the
extrapolation to show a net positive gain in the area (as it shows) but a larger number of hectares in
terms of transition occurring.
Comment 8: It's almost impossible to visualize anything in Figure 3... I would consider removing this
figure as it doesn't seem to add much to the main messages of the manuscript. Or replace it by
another type of visualization highlighting the main message, i.e. the areas where you historically had
broadleaf expansion and not necessarily the same as those projected to occur in the future. Or
combine existing figure with Figure 4, by placing the projected change (in black) on top off the
potential for change.
Response: As suggested, figure 3 has been removed from the manuscript.
Comment 9: Figure 4 - is this displaying the rate of conversion (more area) or the potential for
conversion (higher probability). It is unclear to me at the moment.
Response: Figure 4 shows the spatial trend of conifer to broadleaf forest conversion in Wales. The
intention of this figure is to provide a means of generalizing about the pattern of change. The
numeric values (0-1) do not have any special significance. The surface is created by coding areas of
change with 1 and areas of no change with 0 and treating them as if they were quantitative values.
In other words, this figure is a qualitative representation of the quantitative change (number of
pixels which underwent change).
Comment 10: I know it is a bit the "elephant in the room", but perhaps it would make sense to at least
mention Brexit in the Discussion of the paper, and how its uncertainty might impact the British
landscape. Further, it would highlight the useful characteristics of scenario modelling and scenario
analysis for dealing with uncertainties such as those associated with Brexit.
Response: One of the scenarios we originally considered (and may still attempt to run, even
though the likelihood of any Brexit at all is receding fact) was projecting land use in Wales in the
event of a near-complete collapse of sheep farming. We have added a short description of this to
the discussion, it is an important point (lines 529-532).
Reviewer 2
Comment 1: My main concern is that the conservation scenario assumes that Broadleaf conversion
will stop, but it is not stated how this would take place in terms of existing or expected policies.
Specifically, the authors note there is a public policy goal to increase Broadleaf forest cover and a
general aspiration in support of this goal, but nothing is said about a parallel goal or aspiration to
decrease Broadleaf forest loss. This model assumption can theoretically be acceptable, but adding to
my confusion is how the authors expect this outcome to occur because related policy proposals or
findings are not addressed in the scenario assumptions of the conservation model or in the
discussion, where potential Broadleaf expansion policies are discussed, such as decreased harvesting
rotations to accelerate the conversion of Conifer forests to Broadleaf forests.
Response: The E.C (ecosystem conservation scenario) assumes an extreme case where other land
use categories will continue to convert to Broadleaf forest, but the existing broadleaf forest will
remain intact (no more deforestation). Of course, such this scenario is practically nearly
impossible, but it meant to give the theoretically maximum possible conservation/increase of
broadleaf forest in future. We have highlighted this point in the paper now as it is an important
one. To our knowledge, stated policy is to expand broadleaf woodland. We assume the corollary,
that there is an intention not to allow further losses to existing broadleaf woodland.
Comment 2: All told, given that the rate of Broadleaf loss was significant 2007-2015, more attention
should be given to (a) justifying how no new Broadleaf loss would occur through 2030 from a policy
perspective and/or (b) offering recommendations based on this research or other research that
indicates how ending the historic drivers of Broadleaf conversion can be achieved. In the absence of
discussing either of these elements, the proposed conservation future scenario appears unlikely to be
achievable and thus the model’s results offer less value and accuracy than would be true otherwise.
Response: It is emphasized in forest policy statements that without significantly reducing the rates
of deforestation, there is a danger of net deforestation occurring, given that new woodland creation
is continuing only at a low rate [1]. Moreover, to abide by the international commitments to
prevent deforestation, the Forestry Acts (since 2010) declare it illegal to remove more than 5 cubic
meters of growing trees per quarter in Great Britain, without approval [1]. In addition to this,
different organizations working on developing a network of healthy and resilient ecosystems in
the UK (i.e. The Scottish Wildlife Trust) focus on expanding the existing communities of native
species by restoring the degraded habitats and protecting the existing habitat from further loss [1].
Therefore, the current policies revolve around the notion of decreasing the deforestation and the
assumption of “no broadleaf deforestation” in the E.C. scenario – though only theoretical and
perhaps not achievable by 2030 – makes a sense just to visualize the possible outcomes of the
maximum broadleaf forest protection in Wales.

Comment 3: The second item of concern is that the description of the assumption for the conservation
transition probability for ‘Mountain, Heath and Bog’ appears to be cut off (Page 9 line 254). This
means the adjustments made to the related transition probabilities in Table 2 cannot be fully
understood or verified.
Response: Thank you for pointing out this extremely important mistake. It was a typing error. We
assumed that in 2015-2030, the probability of the LULC class, ‘Mountain, Heath and Bog’ persisting
itself will increase by 50%. The changes have been made in line 273-274.
Comment 4: The last item of note is that some LULC categories and transitions were excluded
because they were “not relevant to our objectives (e.g., urban areas).” I presume that urbanization
was a factor in driving historic Broadleaf forest loss. Either way, this paper could be improved in
supporting its policy recommendations by better describing the causes of ecosystem conversion
historically and by offering more discussion about how these factors could/would be mitigated in the
conservation scenario, especially given the conservation scenario assumption of no net Broadleaf
forest loss. Also, if there was no significant historic loss of ecosystems due to “Built Areas,” I suggest
noting this in the paper.
Response: The exclusion of built areas was based on the observation that this class had a
negligible contribution to the gain/loss of all other classes between 2007-2015. This has been added
in the manuscript now (lines 152-155).
