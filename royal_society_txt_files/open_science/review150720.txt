Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
In this lab-based study the authors tackle an interesting topic by showing that in two different
species of water bugs with paternal egg care, females prefer to mate with males that are carrying
a reduced number of eggs over males with all eggs removed. The findings have been placed in
the relevant context of sexually selected paternal care.
The study has potential to make a valuable contribution to its field. However, the exact value of
the study is difficult to judge from the current version of the manuscript because too much of
essential information has been placed as the supplementary material (comments 3, 5, and 9,
below) and a key method detail is missing (comment 2). Furthermore, the authors should more
explicitly discuss the possibility that their results could also have resulted from behavioural
differences between individuals experiencing different treatment procedures (comments 7 and 8).
I note that the authors have already partially addressed this question by showing - solely in the
supplementary material - that the males assigned to the two contrasting treatments did not
significantly differ in their courtship rates (see comment 8). However, it would nevertheless be
good to discuss the possibility of any other behavioural differences and move the courtship
assessment in the main text. Finally, although the text is completely understandable, it is a bit
clumsy at places (particularly in the introduction), and the readability of the manuscript could
therefore be further improved by editing the language.
For further details, please refer to my numbered comments, below.
1. Page 5, lines 5-7
It seems to me that the number of eggs deposited by the female was used as a measure (proxy) of
her mate preference. It would be helpful to explicitly state that somewhere.
2. Page 5, line 16-18
Please explain how the reversal in egg carrying was performed. This information is important for
understanding your study design. In particular, how did the male without any eggs (i.e.
'uncaring') receive new eggs in the case it did not get any in experiment 1? What about the other
male?
3. Page 5. Consider placing Figure S1 in the actual manuscript, if there is space for it.
4. Page 5, lines 25-32
Did you check for overdispersion? If you did, it would be good to explicitly note that here. In
particular, if the data are overdispersed, a model with a Poisson distribution gives unreliable
results. (However, if overdispersion is not an issue with your data-set, a Poisson distribution
seems like the correct approach to me.). See e.g. Zuur et al. 2013 for further details. - Zuur AF,
Hilbe J, Ieno EN. 2013 A Beginner's guide to GLM and GLMM with R: a frequentist and Bayesian
perspective for ecologists. Newburgh, UK: Highland Statistics.
5. Pages 5-6, Results
Currently all result details (except for Figure 1) are given as supplementary material, with the
result section of the manuscript including only verbal statements of the direction of the results.
With the greatest respect, I find such an approach unacceptable. More generally, a major part of
the key information on the study is currently placed as the ESM, which is not helpful for the
reader. Indeed, the models you run were so simple (in a positive way) that it would not take
much more space to give the results in the text. For example in the case of the significant
3
interaction, you do not need to give the main effects from that model: the significance levels of
the two main effects are not relevant when there is a significant interaction between them.
6. Pages 5-6, Results
Currently the verbal result description focuses on the 'technical' results of the generalized mixed
models. However, I think you should, in each case, also explain what the results mean in practice
(with respect to female mating decision). For example, what does it mean in practice that "In A.
japonicus, significant effects of egg bearing, of a test, and their interaction were detected by
GLMM (Table S1)."? (Page 6, lines 8-10)
7. Result interpretation
Is it possible that the removed eggs, or the egg-removal procedure in general, could leave odour
cues on the backs of males that females could use in their choice? (Relevant literature on the
effects of egg removal and egg-related odour cues on mate choice: [i] Lindström & Kangas 1996.
Egg presence, egg loss, and female mate preferences in the sand goby (Pomatoschistus minutus).
Behav. Ecol. 7, 213–217. [ii] Lehtonen & Kvarnemo 2015. Odour cues from suitors’ nests
determine mating success in a fish. Biol. Lett. 11: 20150021.)
8. Result interpretation
Another obvious concern is the presence of any behavioural differences between the males in
relation to how many eggs were removed from their backs. Any such differences could contribute
to the differences between the two treatment groups. It seems that this concern has, at least
partially, been addressed by testing for differences in male courtship behaviour. However, this
key information has been given solely as supplementary material. If manuscript length limits by
the journal allow placing these courtship assessments in the actual manuscript, I think it would
important to do so. If there are any restrictions that do not allow this, you should still much more
clearly refer to these assessments in the main manuscript.
9. Page 7, lines 16-45
This last paragraph of the discussion seems to focus on differences in the pattern of female
preference between the two species. However, the only place where I found any reference to a
test for such species differences is Table S2. Indeed, I did not find any actual method descriptions
for this assessment. It seems strange to me to use a complete paragraph to discuss a result that is
solely based on a table placed as the supplementary material. Hence, I think you should either
give full method and result details for the species comparison in the main manuscript, or
alternatively remove the paragraph discussing species differences.
10. Page 7, Conclusions
I suggest you add a short concluding or summarising paragraph, in which you highlight the take-
home message of your study.
11. Page 10, Figure legend & Figure 1
Please tell what the error bars indicate. In addition, I suggest you at least consider removing the
stars indicating the significance levels from the figure, because it is too ambiguous to which
test(s) they refer. (Alternatively, please give an unambiguous explanation about the topic.)
12. Data table (supplementary material)
The column headings could be clearer. For example, it would be helpful to add units to 'malesize'.
It also took me a while to realise that the column 'female' simply denotes identity of each female.
With this regard, I recommend coding the identities with non-integers for the case that the
statistical software used for analyses considers the integers (values) in the analysis (which could
be a source of error, because the identity 'values' are not meaningful).

13. A few minor suggestions for improving the introduction:
Page 2, line 32
Consider rephrasing the section "...females; therefore, males are prevented from investing in care"
with something more circumspect that does not use the word 'prevent. For example, "...females,
in which case males are not selected to invest in care" - or some other wording along those lines.
Page 2, line 36
Remove the extra dot before the reference
Page 2, line 39
Consider replacing ''since' with 'when'.
Page 2, line 50
Has the hypothesis been commonly tested already earlier? If yes, add other references in addition
to this single case study. If not, rephrase the sentence.
Page 2, line 52
Consider adding a reference to the statement ('most commonly observed in fish') and remove the
extra dot.
Page 5, line 43
Please give the version of R used for performing the analyses.

Review of “sexual selection of male parental care in giant water bugs”
5
This neat experiment is well designed as far as I can see. It controls nicely for male mating status
and experimental intervention. The results are potentially very interesting, adding to our
currently poor knowledge of female choice for parental traits, outside of birds and fish.
However, I have several problems with the reporting of the methods and statistics, the
interpretation of the results, and with the paper generally, that collectively prevent me from
recommending publication as-is. The MS would have to be extensively revised, but I believe this
is only a problem for the statistics and reporting, and potentially not for the data, and thus am
recommending major revision. I think this has a decent chance of becoming publishable, but the
authors need to be very careful and thorough in their revisions as this MS is currently quite
sloppily reported.
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS
The authors’ main conclusion – i.e. that females of one study species showed a stronger
preference for caring males than females of the other species – is supported by the statistics only
in a limited way, despite the data being available to test this hypothesis. First, the main analysis
(number of eggs laid) does not test this hypothesis even though the relevant interaction could
easily have been included in the analysis. In fact the statistics that they do have suggest that the
situation is more complex than their interpretation. Table S1 (although see statistical concerns
below) and Figure 1 both suggest that there may be a caring/trial interaction for A. japonicus but
not for A. major. This means we can’t simply interpret the results as “A. major showed a stronger
preference for caring males” but rather A. japonicus showed increasing preference over time,
whereas A. major showed a preference all the time. It is debatable whether the sample size
supports such a complex conclusion, but this should at least be discussed. Second, this hypothesis
is tested in the analysis given in Table S2, but this is not mentioned in the results section and it is
unclear how relevant this analysis is - the response variable "proportion of eggs" is not
sufficiently described to be able to evaluate its relevance.
Importantly the authors do not distinguish between evolution and maintenance of male parental
care anywhere in the manuscript. This is critical to interpretation of their result because, while
sexual selection may very clearly maintain male care in a population, it is not obvious at all how
it may promote its initial evolution. For example, the authors cite Tallamy (2001) as a key
reference for the idea that sexual selection may “drive the evolution of male care.” Yet a recent
paper by Gilbert & Manica (2014, Evolution) comprehensively rejected this idea. Logically, males
cannot benefit from a female preference for caring males unless males are already caring in the
population. Thus female preference for caring males is unlikely to drive the initial evolution of
male care, although, once evolved, female choice may very well maintain male care. The authors
should be careful to distinguish between evolution and maintenance – what they have here
suggests that sexual selection may simply maintain male care.
The manuscript generally lacks a lot of necessary detail, having clearly been heavily cut to satisfy
space constraints with much information farmed out to ESM and much information simply
missing. For example, much basic natural history information on the relevant species is missing
which would be necessary for me to be able to evaluate the methods and results properly. I
would like to see, for instance, some more information on what (if anything) is known about their
life history and mating system. Do males and females mate multiply? Do males commonly
receive eggs from more than one female? Does one female typically completely fill up a male’s
back with eggs or is there often space for other females to add eggs? (i.e. is the experimental
design biologically relevant?) Are females semelparous or iteroparous (i.e. is the two-sequential-
trials design appropriate for the species’ life history?) What is the typical longevity? Inter-brood
interval? Egg development period? How do we know that the ~12-day interval between trials is
6
appropriate? The reader needs some natural history for context so that these kinds of
unanswered questions do not undermine the integrity of the study.
Methods and Results
Moreover, much methodological detail is missing or in the ESM that is necessary for the text. For
example, the inter-trial period (of ~12 days) is not mentioned in the main text. This is crucial.
Also, the eggs on the backs of the males in the second trial. Were they the exact same eggs as used
in the first trial (but transferred onto the other male)? Or were they new eggs that were laid in the
first trial – and if so, on whose back? Either way, are age of eggs, original recipient of eggs, ID of
egg donor, etc., factors that need accounting for in the models? If not, why not?
Finally I’m not happy that one entire interesting result (effect of eggs upon male courtship) is
placed completely in the ESM, despite the fact that it is included in the discussion. The main text
should at the very least be interpretable as a stand-alone document. What if a reader has the
printed paper but no access to the ESM? If it’s interesting enough to be discussed, then it is
interesting enough to be in the main text.
Statistical concerns
Although clearly lots of thought has gone into the statistics, they are presented very confusingly.
There are no statistics mentioned in the results section. Although the authors have clearly
considered carefully their choice of models and the distribution of the response variable, there is
no information about how model fit was assessed nor whether either distribution is appropriate.
The reader is merely referred to Table S1 where he/she finds a GLMM table, which is a table of
coefficients only. There is bo mention of Table S2 in the Results. Now, Table S1 to me looks
suspiciously like a cut-and-pasted summary table of R output. If this is indeed the case, the p-
values displayed in this table are not appropriate to gauge the significance of terms in the model.
The authors need to have compared GLMMs with and without the term of interest using an
appropriate test statistic. For GLMMs, there are now a number of ways to obtain these statistics
in R and the authors should choose the most appropriate – for guidance they can consult the
information in the lme4 package: “help("pvalues", package="lme4")”. Just to clarify, I need to see
the statistics associated with removing each model term (including interactions) from the full
model – NOT from the summary table output by R, but from specifically conducting the
comparison of GLMMs with and without the terms of interest. These statistics should be reported
in the main text, and the reader should then be referred to the table of coefficients (which should
not contain any p-values, unless specific contrasts have been performed).
In Table S1, why were two separate GLMMs conducted per species instead of one GLMM for
both? One GLMM can account for the interaction of “species” and “trial”, so the authors could
actually test whether or not their conclusion is valid (i.e. whether female A. major showed a
stronger preference for caring males than female A. japonicus).
The GLMM in Table S2 does in fact test for a species-trial interaction. But in this model, the
response variable is “proportion of eggs” - and it is never stated what it is a proportion of (i.e.
what is the denominator?) nor why this test was included at all. What is the point of this
analysis? How do we know this distribution is appropriate? Furthermore this table is not
mentioned in the results, only in the discussion – and the citation is to Table S2 (modelling the
proportion of eggs, whatever that means) and to Figure 1 (which shows number of eggs), making
the job of interpreting this result very hard for the reader.
7
Discussion
The discussion is insubstantial, which is unsurprising given the lack of detail elsewhere, but this
is frustrating given that the result is potentially very interesting. One decent point is made: that
population density may affect mate encounter rate, changing the costs and benefits of female
selectivity between these two species. However, this needs unpacking and explaining further. All
of the points I mention above should be discussed: evolution versus maintenance of male care
and how the results can be interpreted in either light; the interaction of egg-bearing and trial in A.
japonicus but not in A. major; the lack of effect of eggs upon courtship behaviour.
MINOR COMMENTS
Line numbers would have aided the review process!
Change “uncaring” to “non-caring” throughout. (Uncaring means “heartless”!)
P2 para 1: Clutton-Brock 1991 is referenced here but this is now an old review reference; I would
suggest using more recent ones e.g. Costa (2006) The Other Insect Societies, or Trumbo 2014 in
Royle et al’s book Evolution of Parental Care.
P2 para 2: “often tested in fish”. If something is mentioned as having have been “often tested”,
there should be more than 1 citation here – e.g. Forsgren et al (1996 Behav Ecol Sociobiol), Ridley
& Rechten (1981 Behaviour), etc.
P2 para 2: “observed in fish species.” There is an extra full stop here that needs removing.
P3 para 2: “natural and sexual selection in the evolution”
P3 para 2: “evolution of paternal care” – see comment about evolution vs. maintenance above.
P3 para 3: “which have been representatives of” – you mean “which represent classic examples
of”
P4 para 3. “bellied abdomen” should (I think) be “swollen abdomen”
ESM 2. Courtship rate analysis. “Data regarding the proportion of ‘pumping display’ (courtship
rate) were analyzed using a GLMM model”. Proportion of what? Proportion of males
performing the display? Proportion of time spent displaying? The response variable is
insufficiently described for me to be able to judge the appropriateness of the test performed. (If it
is in fact proportional data, as they suggest, then the test is appropriate). However, why is this in
the supplementary information rather than the main text? It’s relevant and interesting.
Figure 1 – What statistical comparison do the asterisks represent? It is not clear. Are they the
result of post-hoc tests or contrasts? Where are these mentioned in the text? How is the reader to
see that there is an interaction in A. japonicus but not in A. major?

This is a straightforward and interesting study that addresses the question of whether female
belostomatines prefer to mate with males that already have some eggs on their backs. The
methods are appropriate (and I thought clever) for the question and the results are very clear.
Although the discussion veers heavily into speculation, the speculation is warranted based on the
associated literature about why males provide exclusive post copulatory care in diverse species.
I have several specific questions and concerns and a few general comments and questions.
Page 2, Line 30. I think the authors should elaborate on the cost of care to males, specifically the
cost of diminished mating opportunities while caring (and why evolutionarily this is not as costly
to females). Also, I think it would be more accurate to say that male fitness may be diminished by
care rather than phrasing it as a prevention. In other words, males either care or they do not, and
if this variation is heritable, one has higher reproductive success than the other.
Page 2, Line 34. I believe this has been suggested for quite a while in animals like stickleback fish
in which males provide care and females prefer traits that are associated with paternal success, as
well as songbirds in which male color may be indicative of his success as a forager (and feeder) of
offspring. Is this really a “new” idea?
Page 3, Line 23. “family oriented” seems a bit anthropomorphic/colloquial. Perhaps just “males
caring for young”?
Page 3, Line 39. Perhaps to clarify the point, instead of “taxa” substitute “subfamily” as the larger
family Belostomatidae includes the lethocerines that do not back brood.
General comment: there is some speculation that males with small egg pads will stop seeking
additional eggs when the length of hatching asynchrony between eggs received from two
subsequent females becomes too long. Do you see evidence of this in either A. japonicus or A.
major? If so, it seems as though the length of time a male has held a small clutch might be
9
associated with his “attractiveness” as a potential mate. It also seems as though it might be
associated with the discarding behavior that males with small pads disproportionately exhibit – if
females are less likely to mate with a male with an older partial pad, one can imagine selection
favoring males that remove them and seek females with larger complements of eggs.
Also: do males in these populations ever receive full complements of eggs from a single female? It
would be interesting to know if the number of unfertilized eggs present in a gravid female might
be associated with mate choice. What if a female has enough eggs to fill an empty back? Would
she prefer a male with no eggs over a male with some eggs?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
The clarity of the manuscript has much improved in the revision. In this regard, moving
important details from supplementary material into the main manuscript has helped a lot.
However, one of my more major concerns (original comment number 4) was not properly
addressed in the revision, possibly due to a misunderstanding - I apologize for not explaining my
concern more clearly. In particular, as explained for example in the text book that I pointed out
(Zuur et al. 2013), Poisson distribution is relevant for count data (such the numbers of eggs here),
but only when the data are NOT overdispersed. As a response to my original comment, the
following sentence had been added "GLMM was an appropriate method because the response
variables show overdispersion [29]." (starting on page 6, line 24). I grant that a GLMM was
appropriate, but a Poisson distribution was not, if the data were, indeed, overdispersed. In such
a case, for example a negative binomial distribution would be a better alternative (see e.g. Zuur et
al. 2013) that gives more reliable results. (You find negative binomial distribution for example in
the 'glmmADMB' package.)
I'd also like to make the following minor suggestions:
Abstract, Lines 22-23 "Our results suggest that the maintenance of elaborate paternal care in giant
water bugs is driven by sexual selection."
Please reword this in a more conservative manner. In particular, your results do, indeed, indicate
that sexual selection plays a role, but because the benefits of parental care (not assessed here) may
be even more important, it is too early to conclude that "parental care is driven by sexual
selection". In this regard, the new wording in the concluding paragraph of the discussion is much
better.

“Sexual selection of male parental care in giant water bugs”
The authors have revised their analysis and interpretation and, subject to some important but
easily resolved statistical issues, I think this is a very nice study. I am happy to recommend
publication after the authors address my remaining statistical concerns. Apart from these, the
authors have done a good job of recasting their interpretation in terms of the maintenance of care
rather than its initial evolution (although see some very minor comments), have brought all
relevant findings into the manuscript rather than the supplementary information, and have
generally addressed my comments well. I look forward to seeing it in print.
STATISTICAL CONCERNS
In the mate choice experiment, only the first GLMM (containing the 3-way interaction) is
necessary. Breaking it down afterwards into two species-specific GLMMs is unnecessary and a
waste of space: the data are already all presented in the first analysis.
12
Moreover, in this first GLMM, having determined that the 3-way interaction is significant in the
full model, no further analysis of this model is necessary (or possible). Assessment of the main
effects is impossible (because, owing to the interaction, the effect of each term depends upon the
state of the other terms in the model).
Given the significance of the interaction, the task is then to assess which combinations of levels
are driving the interaction. This is done using orthogonal contrasts (preferably planned contrasts,
but post-hoc contrasts are also possible). It is here that you can assess whether each species shows
an effect of eggs, trial, which effect is larger, etc. and not by fitting separate models to each
species. Note also that this approach avoids Type 1 error by limiting you to the number of
possible orthogonal contrasts among the permutations of the levels of each term in the model.
Table 1 specific comments (largely recapitulating the above):
1. The S x E x T interaction is significant. This tells us all we need to know – one model is all
you need. The subsequent GLMM models in the mate choice experiment are superfluous.
2. However, you can’t then interpret the significance of main effects and lower-order
interactions in a model that contains a significant higher-order interaction. Therefore (as I said in
reviewing the previous version of this MS), the P-values for main effects and 2-way interactions
presented in this table are not meaningful. Only the effect of removing the 3-way interaction is
interpretable and only this P-value should be presented. The level combinations of interest can be
compared using planned or post-hoc contrasts.
3. Unless the authors have specifically asked R to output something else, which should be
stated clearly and explained, then the table footnotes pertaining to the coefficients are incorrect.
For the default R output, they should read as follows:
†The coefficient indicates the relative effect of EGG-BEARING A. major DURING TEST 1
compared with EGG-BEARING A. japonicus DURING TEST 1.
††The coefficient indicates the relative effect of non-caring male A. JAPONICUS DURING TEST 1
compared with caring male A. JAPONICUS DURING TEST 1.
†††The coefficient indicates the relative effect of 2nd test FOR EGG-BEARING A. JAPONICUS
compared with 1st test FOR EGG-BEARING A. JAPONICUS.
NB. Although the species-specific GLMMs should be removed, I note also that their
interpretation is not quite correct either:
Table 2. The AICs presented here indicate that you cannot rule out the full model in this case, as it
is within 2 AIC points of the lowest AIC in the model set. Under these circumstances, under an
AIC approach, model averaging is appropriate (see Burnham & Anderson 2002). However, these
models are unnecessary as your first model encompasses the whole story (see above).
MINOR COMMENTS AND TYPOS
The text still has a lot of typos and awkward phrasing, especially in the newly added sections,
and would benefit from proof reading.
Abstract – change “evolve” to “be maintained”
P2L16 proposed the idea
P2L22-24 Although I agree, it is not clear how this follows from the previous points in the
paragraph
13
P3L2-5 – Gilbert & Manica (2015, Evolution) is just such a study, and would be appropriate to cite
in this context; see also Manica & Johnstone (2004, Am Nat).
P4:
L12 and L14 – univoltine
L15 “back of the male, who broods them until hatching” or “backs of males, who brood them
until hatching”

“Consecutive egg pads are typically acquired within a few days”, “After mating, the egg pad is
laid on his back within a few days” “after mating with several females, they all lay egg pads on

Comments to the Author(s)
The clarity of the manuscript has much improved in the revision. In this regard, moving
important details from supplementary material into the main manuscript has helped a lot.
However, one of my more major concerns (original comment number 4) was not properly
addressed in the revision, possibly due to a misunderstanding - I apologize for not explaining my
concern more clearly. In particular, as explained for example in the text book that I pointed out
(Zuur et al. 2013), Poisson distribution is relevant for count data (such the numbers of eggs here),
but only when the data are NOT overdispersed. As a response to my original comment, the
following sentence had been added "GLMM was an appropriate method because the response
variables show overdispersion [29]." (starting on page 6, line 24). I grant that a GLMM was
appropriate, but a Poisson distribution was not, if the data were, indeed, overdispersed. In such
a case, for example a negative binomial distribution would be a better alternative (see e.g. Zuur et
al. 2013) that gives more reliable results. (You find negative binomial distribution for example in
the 'glmmADMB' package.)
I'd also like to make the following minor suggestions:
Abstract, Lines 22-23 "Our results suggest that the maintenance of elaborate paternal care in giant
water bugs is driven by sexual selection."
Please reword this in a more conservative manner. In particular, your results do, indeed, indicate
that sexual selection plays a role, but because the benefits of parental care (not assessed here) may
be even more important, it is too early to conclude that "parental care is driven by sexual
selection". In this regard, the new wording in the concluding paragraph of the discussion is much
better.
Page 4, lines 11-12 "Previous reports showed that A. major and A. japonicus were fundamentally
univoltinism [25-27]"
I don't understand this sentence - please explain the topic with everyday language.
Page 4, line 13 "In this study site,...."
No information about the study site has been given before this point. Please either give the
information here or refer to information that will be given later (e.g. "see below")

Comments to the Author(s)
“Sexual selection of male parental care in giant water bugs”
The authors have revised their analysis and interpretation and, subject to some important but
easily resolved statistical issues, I think this is a very nice study. I am happy to recommend
publication after the authors address my remaining statistical concerns. Apart from these, the
authors have done a good job of recasting their interpretation in terms of the maintenance of care
rather than its initial evolution (although see some very minor comments), have brought all
relevant findings into the manuscript rather than the supplementary information, and have
generally addressed my comments well. I look forward to seeing it in print.
STATISTICAL CONCERNS
In the mate choice experiment, only the first GLMM (containing the 3-way interaction) is
necessary. Breaking it down afterwards into two species-specific GLMMs is unnecessary and a
waste of space: the data are already all presented in the first analysis.
17
Moreover, in this first GLMM, having determined that the 3-way interaction is significant in the
full model, no further analysis of this model is necessary (or possible). Assessment of the main
effects is impossible (because, owing to the interaction, the effect of each term depends upon the
state of the other terms in the model).
Given the significance of the interaction, the task is then to assess which combinations of levels
are driving the interaction. This is done using orthogonal contrasts (preferably planned contrasts,
but post-hoc contrasts are also possible). It is here that you can assess whether each species shows
an effect of eggs, trial, which effect is larger, etc. and not by fitting separate models to each
species. Note also that this approach avoids Type 1 error by limiting you to the number of
possible orthogonal contrasts among the permutations of the levels of each term in the model.
Table 1 specific comments (largely recapitulating the above):
1. The S x E x T interaction is significant. This tells us all we need to know – one model is all
you need. The subsequent GLMM models in the mate choice experiment are superfluous.
2. However, you can’t then interpret the significance of main effects and lower-order
interactions in a model that contains a significant higher-order interaction. Therefore (as I said in
reviewing the previous version of this MS), the P-values for main effects and 2-way interactions
presented in this table are not meaningful. Only the effect of removing the 3-way interaction is
interpretable and only this P-value should be presented. The level combinations of interest can be
compared using planned or post-hoc contrasts.
3. Unless the authors have specifically asked R to output something else, which should be
stated clearly and explained, then the table footnotes pertaining to the coefficients are incorrect.
For the default R output, they should read as follows:
†The coefficient indicates the relative effect of EGG-BEARING A. major DURING TEST 1
compared with EGG-BEARING A. japonicus DURING TEST 1.
††The coefficient indicates the relative effect of non-caring male A. JAPONICUS DURING TEST 1
compared with caring male A. JAPONICUS DURING TEST 1.
†††The coefficient indicates the relative effect of 2nd test FOR EGG-BEARING A. JAPONICUS
compared with 1st test FOR EGG-BEARING A. JAPONICUS.
NB. Although the species-specific GLMMs should be removed, I note also that their
interpretation is not quite correct either:
Table 2. The AICs presented here indicate that you cannot rule out the full model in this case, as it
is within 2 AIC points of the lowest AIC in the model set. Under these circumstances, under an
AIC approach, model averaging is appropriate (see Burnham & Anderson 2002). However, these
models are unnecessary as your first model encompasses the whole story (see above).
MINOR COMMENTS AND TYPOS
The text still has a lot of typos and awkward phrasing, especially in the newly added sections,
and would benefit from proof reading.
Abstract – change “evolve” to “be maintained”
P2L16 proposed the idea
P2L22-24 Although I agree, it is not clear how this follows from the previous points in the
paragraph
18
P3L2-5 – Gilbert & Manica (2015, Evolution) is just such a study, and would be appropriate to cite
in this context; see also Manica & Johnstone (2004, Am Nat).
P4:
L12 and L14 – univoltine
L15 “back of the male, who broods them until hatching” or “backs of males, who brood them
until hatching”
L17 “After all eggs hatch, male mates with females, and then brood next egg pad on his back
within a few days” – the English is not quite correct here and it is slightly ambiguous exactly
what you mean – “one male mates with several females”? “one male mates with one female”?
“Consecutive egg pads are typically acquired within a few days”, “After mating, the egg pad is
laid on his back within a few days” “after mating with several females, they all lay egg pads on
his back within a few days”, etc? Please rephrase to be a bit more clear and specific.
L19 under field conditions
L20 remove space before “mean”
L23 add full stop after japonicus
P6 L5: If you want a reference to justify using eggs laid as a proxy for mate preference, use Ridley
& Rechten (1981, Behaviour) (for an insect example we also did this in our paper: Gilbert et al
2010, Ecol Ent, and in Thomas & Manica 2005, Anim Behav, but don’t feel any pressure to cite us
here!)
P6 L21 onward: see Statistical concerns

??
L16 No need for extra GLMM here – see Statistical concerns

The authors have improved their interesting manuscript on each round of revisions. In the latest
revision, they also addressed the stat issue I had earlier pointed out.
While the clarity of the text has also improved during the revisions, I have nevertheless provided
a couple of minor language suggestions, which the authors may still consider addressing.
Introduction, lines 6-7
I recommend removing the part "which is not common among animals" from this sentence. While
the part is true, the overall statement remains correct even without it. The flow of the rest of the
sentence, in turn, would be better after the removal.
Introduction, lines 12-14 "In addition, parental individuals are usually prevented from acquiring
new mates while caring for offspring, leading to diminished mating opportunities in the future..."
20
The verb 'to prevent' seems to imply that other individuals are preventing parental individuals
from acquiring new mates. However, I assume this is not what was meant here. I therefore
recommend replacing the passage with something like:
"In addition, parental individuals usually have fewer re-mating opportunities due to a reduced
ability to attract new mates while caring for offspring..."
Introduction, lines 18-20 "Female preference for caring males is unlikely to drive the initial
evolution of paternal care, although, once evolved, female choice may maintain paternal care."
For clarity, I recommend adjusting this sentence to something like:
"While female mate preferences are unlikely to drive the emergence of paternal care, they may
impact the maintenance and further evolution of care behaviours."

Firstly can I apologise to both the authors and the editor for the delay in receiving this review; I
was kept off work by an infection for much longer than anticipated.
The authors have now largely addressed my concerns and I am now pretty much happy for this
to be published.
The way the statistical contrasts have been handled (using post-hoc Wilcoxon tests) is not exactly
what I recommended, but is a more-or-less acceptable substitute to which I have no particularly
strong objections. The experimental data are sound and the story is convincing; I have no wish to
subject the authors to a laborious third round of review for the sake of pedantry.
Although I have no wish to see this again, and am recommending only minor revisions, I have
one remaining question that the authors should answer. In this second revision, the statistical
interaction in the GLMM is now no longer significant, which is a change from the previous
21
revision in which it was significant and had therefore been retained in the model. This in itself is
fine as the authors' interpretation of this result is appropriate. However, looking at the new Table
1, it appears that neither the S x T interaction nor the E x T interaction was significant (p=0.47 and
p=0.48, respectively). Why were these interactions retained in the model? If the authors are
using a different criterion for comparing models, such as AIC (which they were using in a
previous revision of the MS), then this needs to be made clear in the methods section. If they are
using the p-values shown in Table 1, then it appears as if they are retaining non-significant
interaction terms in the model, and they should explain why they have chosen to do that.
This concern aside, I am happy to recommend publication and look forward to seeing this in
print - it will be a valuable contribution to the literature.

‘Sexual selection of male parental care in giant water bugs’ by Shin-ya Ohba, Noboru Okuda and Shin-ichi
Kudo
Dear Sir,
Thank you for your letter regarding the above-mentioned manuscript, which was originally submitted on 3
July 2015. The reviewers’ suggestions were very helpful, and we have carefully revised the manuscript in
accordance with their comments. The former version of the manuscript included many electronic
supplementary materials (ESMs) because we had submitted it to Biology Letters before submitting it to
Royal Society Open Science. In this revision, we have added the supplements as figures and tables in the
main document. We hope the revised manuscript is now acceptable for publication.
Yours sincerely,
Shin-ya Ohba

Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
The study has potential to make a valuable contribution to its field. However, the exact value of the
study is difficult to judge from the current version of the manuscript because too much of essential
information has been placed as the supplementary material (comments 3, 5, and 9, below) and a key
method detail is missing (comment 2). Furthermore, the authors should more explicitly discuss the
possibility that their results could also have resulted from behavioural differences between individuals
experiencing different treatment procedures (comments 7 and 8). I note that the authors have already
partially addressed this question by showing - solely in the supplementary material - that the males
assigned to the two contrasting treatments did not significantly differ in their courtship rates (see
comment 8). However, it would nevertheless be good to discuss the possibility of any other
behavioural differences and move the courtship assessment in the main text. Finally, although the text
is completely understandable, it is a bit clumsy at places (particularly in the introduction), and the
readability of the manuscript could therefore be further improved by editing the language.
>>We are grateful to reviewer 1 for the critical comments and useful suggestions that have helped
us to improve our manuscript considerably. In this revision, we have added the electronic supplementary
materials as figures and tables in the main document. We have discussed the behavioural differences, and the
revised manuscript has been checked by a native English speaker. Please see the revised text.
For further details, please refer to my numbered comments, below.
1. Page 5, lines 5-7
It seems to me that the number of eggs deposited by the female was used as a measure (proxy) of her
mate preference. It would be helpful to explicitly state that somewhere.
>>We have revised this as below (P. 6, line 5):
We counted the number of eggs added to the back of each of these two males as a proxy of female mate
preference.
2. Page 5, line 16-18
Please explain how the reversal in egg carrying was performed. This information is important for
understanding your study design. In particular, how did the male without any eggs (i.e. 'uncaring')
receive new eggs in the case it did not get any in experiment 1? What about the other male?
>>We have added a detailed explanation (P. 6, lines 10–16).

>>We have added Figure S1 (as Figure 1) to the main document.

Did you check for overdispersion? If you did, it would be good to explicitly note that here. In
particular, if the data are overdispersed, a model with a Poisson distribution gives unreliable results.
(However, if overdispersion is not an issue with your data-set, a Poisson distribution seems like the
correct approach to me.). See e.g. Zuur et al. 2013 for further details. - Zuur AF, Hilbe J, Ieno EN.

random effect in each species. Thus, we used a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a Poisson
distribution, rather than a simple GLM. GLMM can account for such overdispersion in the data.
To clarify these issues, we have also added the following sentences (P. 6, line 24–P. 7, line 1):
GLMM was an appropriate method because the response variables show overdispersion ([29]). Each female
was considered as a random effect.
5. Pages 5-6, Results
Currently all result details (except for Figure 1) are given as supplementary material, with the result
section of the manuscript including only verbal statements of the direction of the results. With the
greatest respect, I find such an approach unacceptable. More generally, a major part of the key
information on the study is currently placed as the ESM, which is not helpful for the reader. Indeed,
the models you run were so simple (in a positive way) that it would not take much more space to give
the results in the text. For example in the case of the significant interaction, you do not need to give
the main effects from that model: the significance levels of the two main effects are not relevant when
there is a significant interaction between them.
>>We have added the details of the results to the main document.
6. Pages 5-6, Results
Currently the verbal result description focuses on the 'technical' results of the generalized mixed
models. However, I think you should, in each case, also explain what the results mean in practice (with
respect to female mating decision). For example, what does it mean in practice that "In A. japonicus,
significant effects of egg bearing, of a test, and their interaction were detected by GLMM (Table
S1)."? (Page 6, lines 8-10)
>>We have revised this as below (P. 8, lines 23–24):
Significant effects of egg bearing, of a test, and their interaction were detected using GLMM (Table 3),
indicating that the female mate preferences differ between tests in each species.
7. Result interpretation
Is it possible that the removed eggs, or the egg-removal procedure in general, could leave odour cues
on the backs of males that females could use in their choice? (Relevant literature on the effects of egg
removal and egg-related odour cues on mate choice: [i] Lindström & Kangas 1996. Egg presence, egg
loss, and female mate preferences in the sand goby (Pomatoschistus minutus). Behav. Ecol. 7, 213–217.
[ii] Lehtonen & Kvarnemo 2015. Odour cues from suitors’ nests determine mating success in a fish.
Biol. Lett. 11: 20150021.)
>>If females preferred non-caring males or showed no preference, we would need to check for
odour cues, but since females preferred caring males in both species, we doubt that odour cues are
important.
8. Result interpretation
Another obvious concern is the presence of any behavioural differences between the males in relation
to how many eggs were removed from their backs. Any such differences could contribute to the
differences between the two treatment groups. It seems that this concern has, at least partially, been
addressed by testing for differences in male courtship behaviour. However, this key information has
been given solely as supplementary material. If manuscript length limits by the journal allow placing
these courtship assessments in the actual manuscript, I think it would important to do so. If there are
any restrictions that do not allow this, you should still much more clearly refer to these assessments in
the main manuscript.
>>We added a new section about courtship behaviour (methods: P. 7, line 13–P. 8, line 6, results: P.
9, lines 5-10).
9. Page 7, lines 16-45
This last paragraph of the discussion seems to focus on differences in the pattern of female preference
between the two species. However, the only place where I found any reference to a test for such species
differences is Table S2. Indeed, I did not find any actual method descriptions for this assessment. It
seems strange to me to use a complete paragraph to discuss a result that is solely based on a table
placed as the supplementary material. Hence, I think you should either give full method and result
details for the species comparison in the main manuscript, or alternatively remove the paragraph
discussing species differences.
>>We added Table S2 as Table 1 in the main document.
10. Page 7, Conclusions
I suggest you add a short concluding or summarising paragraph, in which you highlight the
take-home message of your study.
>>We have added it as below (P. 11, lines 22–P. 12, line 1):
In conclusion, our results, together with the existing evidence, indicate that sexual selection plays a
significant role in the maintenance of elaborate paternal care in giant water bugs, but the importance of egg
bearing by males in female mate choice varies among species.
11. Page 10, Figure legend & Figure 1
Please tell what the error bars indicate. In addition, I suggest you at least consider removing the stars
indicating the significance levels from the figure, because it is too ambiguous to which test(s) they
refer. (Alternatively, please give an unambiguous explanation about the topic.)
>>We have revised the figure and added more information to the figure legend (P. 18, lines 2–4).
12. Data table (supplementary material)
The column headings could be clearer. For example, it would be helpful to add units to 'malesize'. It
also took me a while to realise that the column 'female' simply denotes identity of each female. With
this regard, I recommend coding the identities with non-integers for the case that the statistical
software used for analyses considers the integers (values) in the analysis (which could be a source of
error, because the identity 'values' are not meaningful).
>>We have revised this accordingly.
13. A few minor suggestions for improving the introduction:
Page 2, line 32
Consider rephrasing the section "...females; therefore, males are prevented from investing in care"
with something more circumspect that does not use the word 'prevent. For example, "...females, in
which case males are not selected to invest in care" - or some other wording along those lines.
>>We have revised this as below (P. 2, lines 13–15):
…and such a mating cost can be greater for males than for females, in which case males are not selected to
invest in care [1, 6].

Review of “sexual selection of male parental care in giant water bugs”
This neat experiment is well designed as far as I can see. It controls nicely for male mating status and
experimental intervention. The results are potentially very interesting, adding to our currently poor
knowledge of female choice for parental traits, outside of birds and fish.
However, I have several problems with the reporting of the methods and statistics, the interpretation
of the results, and with the paper generally, that collectively prevent me from recommending
publication as-is. The MS would have to be extensively revised, but I believe this is only a problem
for the statistics and reporting, and potentially not for the data, and thus am recommending major
revision. I think this has a decent chance of becoming publishable, but the authors need to be very
careful and thorough in their revisions as this MS is currently quite sloppily reported.
>>We are grateful to reviewer 2 for the critical comments and useful suggestions that have helped
us to improve our manuscript considerably. In this revision, we have revised our statistical methods and their
reporting. Please see the revised text.
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS
The authors’ main conclusion – i.e. that females of one study species showed a stronger preference for
caring males than females of the other species – is supported by the statistics only in a limited way,
despite the data being available to test this hypothesis. First, the main analysis (number of eggs laid)
does not test this hypothesis even though the relevant interaction could easily have been included in
the analysis. In fact the statistics that they do have suggest that the situation is more complex than
their interpretation. Table S1 (although see statistical concerns below) and Figure 1 both suggest that
there may be a caring/trial interaction for A. japonicus but not for A. major. This means we can’t
simply interpret the results as “A. major showed a stronger preference for caring males” but rather A.
japonicus showed increasing preference over time, wheras A. major showed a preference all the time.
It is debatable whether the sample size supports such a complex conclusion, but this should at least be
discussed. Second, this hypothesis is tested in the analysis given in Table S2, but this is not mentioned
in the results section and it is unclear how relevant this analysis is - the response variable "proportion
of eggs" is not sufficiently described to be able to evaluate its relevance.
>>First issue (statistical analysis and interpretation): We have revised our statistical methods and
their reporting. Species (A. major and A. japonicus), ‘Egg-bearing’ (caring versus non-caring), test (first
versus second), and their interactions were incorporated into GLMM as an explanatory variable. GLMMs
were performed separately for each species because third order interaction (species*egg-bearing*test) was
significant. The best model for each species was selected by a stepwise method on the basis of the Akaike’s
information criterion (AIC) from the full model. We also clarified the differences between observations of
the two species (P. 8, lines 13-15).
>>Second issue (Table S2): This result has been removed from the revised manuscript.
Importantly the authors do not distinguish between evolution and maintenance of male parental care
anywhere in the manuscript. This is critical to interpretation of their result because, while sexual
selection may very clearly maintain male care in a population, it is not obvious at all how it may
promote its initial evolution. For example, the authors cite Tallamy (2001) as a key reference for the
idea that sexual selection may “drive the evolution of male care.” Yet a recent paper by Gilbert &
Manica (2014, Evolution) comprehensively rejected this idea. Logically, males cannot benefit from a
female preference for caring males unless males are already caring in the population. Thus female
preference for caring males is unlikely to drive the initial evolution of male care, although, once
evolved, female choice may very well maintain male care. The authors should be careful to distinguish
between evolution and maintenance – what they have here suggests that sexual selection may simply
maintain male care.
>>We have considered the reviewer’s comments. We did not intend to emphasize ‘evolution of
parental care by sexual selection,’ as our study only showed female choice based on paternal care by males.
Accordingly, we have carefully revised the manuscript and avoided confusing ‘evolution’ and ‘maintenance’.
We have also addressed the comment by adding a statement in the Introduction section to clarify our
intention (P. 2, lines 22–24).
The manuscript generally lacks a lot of necessary detail, having clearly been heavily cut to satisfy
space constraints with much information farmed out to ESM and much information simply missing.
For example, much basic natural history information on the relevant species is missing which would
be necessary for me to be able to evaluate the methods and results properly.
I would like to see, for instance, some more information on what (if anything) is known about their
life history and mating system. Do males and females mate multiply? Do males commonly receive eggs
from more than one female? Does one female typically completely fill up a male’s back with eggs or is
there often space for other females to add eggs? (i.e. is the experimental design biologically relevant?)
Are females semelparous or iteroparous (i.e. is the two-sequential-trials design appropriate for the
species’ life history?) What is the typical longevity? Inter-brood interval? Egg development period?
How do we know that the ~12-day interval between trials is appropriate? The reader needs some
natural history for context so that these kinds of unanswered questions do not undermine the integrity
of the study.
>>We have added a paragraph that described the basic natural history of Appasus species (P. 4,
lines 5–14).
Methods and Results
Moreover, much methodological detail is missing or in the ESM that is necessary for the text. For
example, the inter-trial period (of ~12 days) is not mentioned in the main text. This is crucial. Also, the
eggs on the backs of the males in the second trial. Were they the exact same eggs as used in the first
trial (but transferred onto the other male)? Or were they new eggs that were laid in the first trial –
and if so, on whose back? Either way, are age of eggs, original recipient of eggs, ID of egg donor, etc.,
factors that need accounting for in the models? If not, why not?
>>We have added these missing details to the description of our experimental methods (P. 6, lines
10–16).
Finally I’m not happy that one entire interesting result (effect of eggs upon male courtship) is placed
completely in the ESM, despite the fact that it is included in the discussion. The main text should at
the very least be interpretable as a stand-alone document. What if a reader has the printed paper but
no access to the ESM? If it’s interesting enough to be discussed, then it is interesting enough to be in
the main text.
>>We have added the electronic supplementary materials as figures and tables in the main
document.
Statistical concerns
Although clearly lots of thought has gone into the statistics, they are presented very confusingly.
There are no statistics mentioned in the results section. Although the authors have clearly considered
carefully their choice of models and the distribution of the response variable, there is no information
about how model fit was assessed nor whether either distribution is appropriate. The reader is merely
referred to Table S1 where he/she finds a GLMM table, which is a table of coefficients only. There is
bo mention of Table S2 in the Results. Now, Table S1 to me looks suspiciously like a cut-and-pasted
summary table of R output. If this is indeed the case, the p-values displayed in this table are not
appropriate to gauge the significance of terms in the model. The authors need to have compared
GLMMs with and without the term of interest using an appropriate test statistic. For GLMMs,
there are now a number of ways to obtain these statistics in R and the authors should choose the most
appropriate – for guidance they can consult the information in the lme4 package: “help("pvalues",
package="lme4")”. Just to clarify, I need to see the statistics associated with removing each model
term (including interactions) from the full model – NOT from the summary table output by R, but
from specifically conducting the comparison of GLMMs with and without the terms of interest. These
statistics should be reported in the main text, and the reader should then be referred to the table of
coefficients (which should not contain any p-values, unless specific contrasts have been performed).
>>We confirmed that the data were overdispersed, and we considered replication (female) to be a
random effect in each species. Thus, we used a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a Poisson
distribution rather than a simple GLM. GLMM can account for such overdispersion in the data. To clarify
these issues, we have also added an explanation of our approach to the Materials and Methods section (P. 6,
line 24–P. 7, line 1). For the results shown in Table S1, which is now Table 3 (P. 19), we judged that the
p-values are appropriate (not inappropriate) because our analysis encompasses two treatments (caring vs.
non-caring, and first vs. second test). Therefore, the p-values show a significant difference between the two
and significant effect. In addition, the stepwise method using the stepAIC package was used for model
selection (P. 7, line 5-9).
In Table S1, why were two separate GLMMs conducted per species instead of one GLMM for both?
One GLMM can account for the interaction of “species” and “trial”, so the authors could actually test
whether or not their conclusion is valid (i.e. whether female A. major showed a stronger preference
for caring males than female A. japonicus).
>>Because the two species gave different results concerning the strength of female choice, it is
difficult to interpret the result of a GLMM including ‘species’. Therefore, we conducted separate GLMMs
for each species. To clarify, we first created a full model that included ‘species’ as an explanatory variable,
and then used separate GLMMs after confirming the significant effect of ‘species’.
The GLMM in Table S2 does in fact test for a species-trial interaction. But in this model, the
response variable is “proportion of eggs” - and it is never stated what it is a proportion of (i.e. what is
the denominator?) nor why this test was included at all. What is the point of this analysis? How do
we know this distribution is appropriate? Furthermore this table is not mentioned in the results,
only in the discussion – and the citation is to Table S2 (modelling the proportion of eggs, whatever
that means) and to Figure 1 (which shows number of eggs), making the job of interpreting this result
very hard for the reader.
>>This result was removed from the revised manuscript.
Discussion
The discussion is insubstantial, which is unsurprising given the lack of detail elsewhere, but this is
frustrating given that the result is potentially very interesting. One decent point is made: that
population density may affect mate encounter rate, changing the costs and benefits of female
selectivity between these two species. However, this needs unpacking and explaining further. All of the
points I mention above should be discussed: evolution versus maintenance of male care and how the
results can be interpreted in either light; the interaction of egg-bearing and trial in A. japonicus but
not in A. major; the lack of effect of eggs upon courtship behaviour.
>>We have added the electric materials supplements as figures and tables in the main document.
Based on the reviewer’s suggestion, we have revised Introduction and Discussion substantially. Please see
the revised text.
MINOR COMMENTS
Line numbers would have aided the review process!
Change “uncaring” to “non-caring” throughout. (Uncaring means “heartless”!)
>>We have revised the manuscript accordingly.
P2 para 1: Clutton-Brock 1991 is referenced here but this is now an old review reference; I would
suggest using more recent ones e.g. Costa (2006) The Other Insect Societies, or Trumbo 2014 in Royle
et al’s book Evolution of Parental Care.
>>We have included more recent references, as recommended by the reviewer (P. 2, line 6-9).
P2 para 2: “often tested in fish”. If something is mentioned as having have been “often tested”, there
should be more than 1 citation here – e.g. Forsgren et al (1996 Behav Ecol Sociobiol), Ridley &
Rechten (1981 Behaviour), etc.
>>We have added more references (P. 2, line 8).
P2 para 2: “observed in fish species.” There is an extra full stop here that needs removing.
>>We have deleted this (P. 3, line 1).
P3 para 2: “natural and sexual selection in the evolution”
>>We have revised this (P. 3, lines 7–9).
P3 para 2: “evolution of paternal care” – see comment about evolution vs. maintenance above.
>>We carefully revised the manuscript and avoided confusing ‘evolution’ and ‘maintenance’. We
also addressed the reviewer’s comment by adding a statement in the Introduction section to clarify our
intention (P. 2, line 22–24).
P3 para 3: “which have been representatives of” – you mean “which represent classic examples of”
>>We have revised this (P. 3, line 19).
P4 para 3. “bellied abdomen” should (I think) be “swollen abdomen”
>>We have revised this (P. 6, line 2).
ESM 2. Courtship rate analysis. “Data regarding the proportion of ‘pumping display’ (courtship rate)
were analyzed using a GLMM model”. Proportion of what? Proportion of males performing the
display? Proportion of time spent displaying? The response variable is insufficiently described for me
to be able to judge the appropriateness of the test performed. (If it is in fact proportional data, as
they suggest, then the test is appropriate). However, why is this in the supplementary information
rather than the main text? It’s relevant and interesting.
>>We used ‘proportion of males performing the display’ as the response variable. We have added a
sentence to clarify our methods (P. 8, lines 1-4).
Figure 1 – What statistical comparison do the asterisks represent? It is not clear. Are they the result
of post-hoc tests or contrasts? Where are these mentioned in the text? How is the reader to see that
there is an interaction in A. japonicus but not in A. major?
>>We have revised the figure and added more information to the figure legend (P. 18, lines 2–4).
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
This is a straightforward and interesting study that addresses the question of whether female
belostomatines prefer to mate with males that already have some eggs on their backs. The methods
are appropriate (and I thought clever) for the question and the results are very clear. Although the
discussion veers heavily into speculation, the speculation is warranted based on the associated
literature about why males provide exclusive post copulatory care in diverse species.
>>We are grateful to reviewer 3 for the critical comments and useful suggestions that have helped
us to improve our manuscript considerably.
I have several specific questions and concerns and a few general comments and questions.
Page 2, Line 30. I think the authors should elaborate on the cost of care to males, specifically the cost
of diminished mating opportunities while caring (and why evolutionarily this is not as costly to
females). Also, I think it would be more accurate to say that male fitness may be diminished by care
rather than phrasing it as a prevention. In other words, males either care or they do not, and if this
variation is heritable, one has higher reproductive success than the other.
>>We have added the explanation of ‘the cost of care to males’ as below (P. 2, lines 11–15):
In addition, parental individuals are usually prevented from acquiring new mates while caring for offspring,
leading to diminished mating opportunities in the future [7], and such a mating cost can be greater for males
than for females, in which case males are not selected to invest in care [1, 6].
Page 2, Line 34. I believe this has been suggested for quite a while in animals like stickleback fish in
which males provide care and females prefer traits that are associated with paternal success, as well
as songbirds in which male color may be indicative of his success as a forager (and feeder) of offspring.
Is this really a “new” idea?
>>Based on the reviewer’s suggestion, we have deleted ‘new’ from the sentence (P. 2, line 16).
Page 3, Line 23. “family oriented” seems a bit anthropomorphic/colloquial. Perhaps just “males
caring for young”?
>>We have revised this as below (P. 3, line 11-13):
The conclusions of these studies are inconsistent: female preference for caring males was observed in
assassin bugs [16] and harvestmen [17], whereas sea spider females preferred non-caring males over males
caring for eggs [18].
Page 3, Line 39. Perhaps to clarify the point, instead of “taxa” substitute “subfamily” as the larger
family Belostomatidae includes the lethocerines that do not back brood.
>>We have revised this (P. 3, line 20).
General comment: there is some speculation that males with small egg pads will stop seeking
additional eggs when the length of hatching asynchrony between eggs received from two subsequent
females becomes too long. Do you see evidence of this in either A. japonicus or A. major? If so, it
seems as though the length of time a male has held a small clutch might be associated with his
“attractiveness” as a potential mate. It also seems as though it might be associated with the discarding
behavior that males with small pads disproportionately exhibit – if females are less likely to mate with
a male with an older partial pad, one can imagine selection favoring males that remove them and seek
females with larger complements of eggs.
>>No, we did not test whether males with small egg pads will stop seeking additional eggs when
the length of hatching asynchrony becomes too long. In this study, we observed breeding behaviour in the
middle of the breeding season for both Appasus species, so all males received additional eggs, with no
exceptions. In future studies, we will consider this comment.
Also: do males in these populations ever receive full complements of eggs from a single female? It
would be interesting to know if the number of unfertilized eggs present in a gravid female might be
associated with mate choice. What if a female has enough eggs to fill an empty back? Would she
prefer a male with no eggs over a male with some eggs?
>>A single male can carry many more eggs than the maximum that a single female can lay. We
have added this information to the manuscript (P. 10, lines 19–P. 11, lines 2). In future studies, we will
consider this comment, as well. We find this idea interesting.

‘Sexual selection of male parental care in giant water bugs’ by Shin-ya Ohba, Noboru Okuda and Shin-ichi
Kudo
Dear Dr. Matthew Allinson,
Thank you for your letter regarding the above-mentioned manuscript, which was resubmitted on the 25th
of December 2015. The reviewers’ suggestions were very helpful, and we have carefully revised the
manuscript in accordance with their comments. We re-analysed our data using a method suggested by
Reviewer 1, followed by more simple analyses based on the comment by Reviewer 2. The results became
clearer and more robust as compared to the results of the previous version. We would like to acknowledge
the insightful comments of the two reviewers.
We re-analysed the data using glmmADMB, with a negative binomial distribution, as suggested by
Reviewer 1. This GLMM revealed an interspecific difference in the degree of female mate preference for
caring males between two species. Following this result, we adopted two post-hoc analyses. First, we used
a non-parametric paired test to compare female preference between caring and non-caring males for each
species, and adjusted the overall significance level using a sequential Bonferroni method. Second, we
compared female preference between caring and non-caring males in each test within each species using
the same non-parametric paired test. Because the new GLMM did not detect a significant effect of the
“test”, the first analysis pooling “test” for each species will be appropriate for the post-hoc analysis.
However, the second analysis was also carried out because we would like to compare the results of each
test within each species, as shown in Figure 3. We included the results of the second analysis in main text
(P. 8, Line 14-19), and those of the first analysis can be found in Electronic Supplement Material 2. If the
editor judges that these two results are redundant, we would agree to delete one of them.
We hope the revised manuscript is now acceptable for publication.
Yours sincerely,
Shin-ya Ohba

Comments to the Author(s)
The clarity of the manuscript has much improved in the revision. In this regard, moving important details
from supplementary material into the main manuscript has helped a lot. However, one of my more major
concerns (original comment number 4) was not properly addressed in the revision, possibly due to a
misunderstanding - I apologize for not explaining my concern more clearly. In particular, as explained for
example in the text book that I pointed out (Zuur et al. 2013), Poisson distribution is relevant for count
data (such the numbers of eggs here), but only when the data are NOT overdispersed. As a response to
my original comment, the following sentence had been added "GLMM was an appropriate method because
the response variables show overdispersion [29]." (starting on page 6, line 24). I grant that a GLMM was
appropriate, but a Poisson distribution was not, if the data were, indeed, overdispersed. In such a case,
for example a negative binomial distribution would be a better alternative (see e.g. Zuur et al. 2013) that
gives more reliable results. (You find negative binomial distribution for example in the 'glmmADMB'
package.)
>>Again, we are grateful to Reviewer 1 for the constructive comments, detailed explanation about
statistical analysis, and useful suggestions, which have helped us to improve our manuscript. We have re-
analysed our data using glmmADMB with a negative binomial distribution. As suggested by Reviewer 1,
this analysis yields more reliable results. We have revised the explanation concerning statistical analysis
(P. 6, Line 23-). Please see the revised text.
I'd also like to make the following minor suggestions:
Abstract, Lines 22-23 "Our results suggest that the maintenance of elaborate paternal care in giant water
bugs is driven by sexual selection."
Please reword this in a more conservative manner. In particular, your results do, indeed, indicate that
sexual selection plays a role, but because the benefits of parental care (not assessed here) may be even
more important, it is too early to conclude that "parental care is driven by sexual selection". In this
regard, the new wording in the concluding paragraph of the discussion is much better.
>>We have revised this as below (P. 1, Lines 22–24), but last paragraph of the discussion (P. 11, Lines
18-21) was not revised, because it needed to be conserved with the first.
Our results suggest that sexual selection plays an important role in the maintaining elaborate paternal
care in giant water bugs, but the...

univoltinism [25-27]"
I don't understand this sentence - please explain the topic with everyday language.
>>We have revised this as below (P. 4, Lines 12-13):
Previous reports showed that A. major and A. japonicus were fundamentally univoltine (having one
generation in a year) [27-29].

No information about the study site has been given before this point. Please either give the information
here or refer to information that will be given later (e.g. "see below")

Comments to the Author(s)
“Sexual selection of male parental care in giant water bugs”
The authors have revised their analysis and interpretation and, subject to some important but easily
resolved statistical issues, I think this is a very nice study. I am happy to recommend publication after the
authors address my remaining statistical concerns. Apart from these, the authors have done a good job of
recasting their interpretation in terms of the maintenance of care rather than its initial evolution (although
see some very minor comments), have brought all relevant findings into the manuscript rather than the
supplementary information, and have generally addressed my comments well. I look forward to seeing it
in print.
>>We are grateful to Reviewer 2 for constructive comments and useful suggestions that have helped us

reporting. Please see the revised text.
STATISTICAL CONCERNS
In the mate choice experiment, only the first GLMM (containing the 3-way interaction) is necessary.
Breaking it down afterwards into two species-specific GLMMs is unnecessary and a waste of space: the
data are already all presented in the first analysis.
Moreover, in this first GLMM, having determined that the 3-way interaction is significant in the full model,
no further analysis of this model is necessary (or possible). Assessment of the main effects is impossible
(because, owing to the interaction, the effect of each term depends upon the state of the other terms in
the model).
Given the significance of the interaction, the task is then to assess which combinations of levels are
driving the interaction. This is done using orthogonal contrasts (preferably planned contrasts, but post-hoc
contrasts are also possible). It is here that you can assess whether each species shows an effect of eggs,
trial, which effect is larger, etc. and not by fitting separate models to each species. Note also that this
approach avoids Type 1 error by limiting you to the number of possible orthogonal contrasts among the
permutations of the levels of each term in the model.
>> We re-analysed the data using glmmADMB with a negative binomial distribution, as suggested by
Reviewer 1. This GLMM revealed an interspecific difference in the degree of female mate preference for
caring males between two species. Following this result, we adopted two post-hoc analyses. First, we used
a non-parametric paired test to compare female preference between caring and non-caring males for each
species, and adjusted the overall significance level using a sequential Bonferroni method. Second, we
compared female preference between caring and non-caring males in each test within each species using
the same non-parametric paired test. Because the new GLMM did not detect a significant effect of the
“test”, the first analysis pooling “test” for each species will be appropriate for the post-hoc analysis.
However, the second analysis was also carried out because we would like to compare the results of each
test within each species, as shown in Figure 3. We have included the results of the second analysis in main
text (P. 8, Line 14-22), and those of the first analysis can be found in Electronic Supplement Material 2.
Furthermore, we would like to thank the reviewers for helping us understand the analysis flow of GLMM.
Table 1 specific comments (largely recapitulating the above):
1. The S x E x T interaction is significant. This tells us all we need to know – one model is all you need.
The subsequent GLMM models in the mate choice experiment are superfluous.
>>We have removed subsequent GLMM.
2. However, you can’t then interpret the significance of main effects and lower-order interactions in a
model that contains a significant higher-order interaction. Therefore (as I said in reviewing the previous
version of this MS), the P-values for main effects and 2-way interactions presented in this table are not
meaningful. Only the effect of removing the 3-way interaction is interpretable and only this P-value should
be presented. The level combinations of interest can be compared using planned or post-hoc contrasts.
>>We have revised the manuscript accordingly. Because our data set had a complicated structure, we
adopted a non-parametric paired test for the post-hoc analysis.
3. Unless the authors have specifically asked R to output something else, which should be stated clearly
and explained, then the table footnotes pertaining to the coefficients are incorrect. For the default R
output, they should read as follows:
†The coefficient indicates the relative effect of EGG-BEARING A. major DURING TEST 1 compared with
EGG-BEARING A. japonicus DURING TEST 1.
††The coefficient indicates the relative effect of non-caring male A. JAPONICUS DURING TEST 1 compared
with caring male A. JAPONICUS DURING TEST 1.
†††The coefficient indicates the relative effect of 2nd test FOR EGG-BEARING A. JAPONICUS compared
with 1st test FOR EGG-BEARING A. JAPONICUS.
NB. Although the species-specific GLMMs should be removed, I note also that their interpretation is not
quite correct either:
>>We have revised the manuscript accordingly.
Table 2. The AICs presented here indicate that you cannot rule out the full model in this case, as it is
within 2 AIC points of the lowest AIC in the model set. Under these circumstances, under an AIC
approach, model averaging is appropriate (see Burnham & Anderson 2002). However, these models are
unnecessary as your first model encompasses the whole story (see above).
>>We have revised the manuscript accordingly.
MINOR COMMENTS AND TYPOS
The text still has a lot of typos and awkward phrasing, especially in the newly added sections, and would
benefit from proof reading.

....back of the male, who broods them until hatching.
L17 “After all eggs hatch, male mates with females, and then brood next egg pad on his back within a few
days” – the English is not quite correct here and it is slightly ambiguous exactly what you mean – “one
male mates with several females”? “one male mates with one female”? “Consecutive egg pads are
typically acquired within a few days”, “After mating, the egg pad is laid on his back within a few days”
“after mating with several females, they all lay egg pads on his back within a few days”, etc? Please
rephrase to be a bit more clear and specific.
>>We have revised the explanation of breeding systems of Appasus as below (P. 4, Line 16-21).
Female Appasus lay their eggs on the back of the male, who broods them until hatching. An egg-pad is
laid on the back of the male by multiple females. Egg development periods depend on water temperature;
they can last about a month in spring and about a week in mid-summer. After all eggs hatch, the male
again mates with some females, and the females lay egg pads on his back within a few days [27].

‘Sexual selection of male parental care in giant water bugs’ by Shin-ya Ohba, Noboru Okuda and Shin-ichi
Kudo
Dear Drs. Andrew Dunn and Kevin Padian,
Thank you for your letter regarding the above-mentioned manuscript. The reviewers’ suggestions were very
helpful, and we have carefully revised the manuscript in accordance with their comments. We re-analysed
our data using a method suggested by Reviewer 1, followed by more simple analyses based on the comment
by Reviewer 2. The new results became clearer and more robust as compared to the results of the previous
version. We would like to acknowledge the insightful comments of the two reviewers.
We hope the revised manuscript is now acceptable for publication.
Yours sincerely,
Shin-ya Ohba

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have improved their interesting manuscript on each round of revisions. In the latest
revision, they also addressed the stat issue I had earlier pointed out.
While the clarity of the text has also improved during the revisions, I have nevertheless provided a
couple of minor language suggestions, which the authors may still consider addressing.
>>We are grateful to Reviewer 1 for the useful suggestions.
Introduction, lines 6-7
I recommend removing the part "which is not common among animals" from this sentence. While the
part is true, the overall statement remains correct even without it. The flow of the rest of the sentence,
in turn, would be better after the removal.
>> We have removed it (P. 2, Line 6).
Introduction, lines 12-14 "In addition, parental individuals are usually prevented from acquiring new
mates while caring for offspring, leading to diminished mating opportunities in the future..."
The verb 'to prevent' seems to imply that other individuals are preventing parental individuals from
acquiring new mates. However, I assume this is not what was meant here. I therefore recommend
replacing the passage with something like:
"In addition, parental individuals usually have fewer re-mating opportunities due to a reduced ability
to attract new mates while caring for offspring..."
>> We have revised the manuscript accordingly (P. 2, Lines 12-14).
Introduction, lines 18-20 "Female preference for caring males is unlikely to drive the initial evolution
of paternal care, although, once evolved, female choice may maintain paternal care."
For clarity, I recommend adjusting this sentence to something like:
"While female mate preferences are unlikely to drive the emergence of paternal care, they may impact
the maintenance and further evolution of care behaviours."
>> We have revised the manuscript accordingly (P. 2, Lines 17-19).

Comments to the Author(s)
Firstly can I apologise to both the authors and the editor for the delay in receiving this review; I was
kept off work by an infection for much longer than anticipated.
The authors have now largely addressed my concerns and I am now pretty much happy for this to be
published.
The way the statistical contrasts have been handled (using post-hoc Wilcoxon tests) is not exactly what
I recommended, but is a more-or-less acceptable substitute to which I have no particularly strong
objections. The experimental data are sound and the story is convincing; I have no wish to subject
the authors to a laborious third round of review for the sake of pedantry.
Although I have no wish to see this again, and am recommending only minor revisions, I have one
remaining question that the authors should answer. In this second revision, the statistical interaction
in the GLMM is now no longer significant, which is a change from the previous revision in which it
was significant and had therefore been retained in the model. This in itself is fine as the authors'
interpretation of this result is appropriate. However, looking at the new Table 1, it appears that
neither the S x T interaction nor the E x T interaction was significant (p=0.47 and p=0.48,
respectively). Why were these interactions retained in the model? If the authors are using a different
criterion for comparing models, such as AIC (which they were using in a previous revision of the MS),
then this needs to be made clear in the methods section. If they are using the p-values shown in Table 1,
then it appears as if they are retaining non-significant interaction terms in the model, and they should
explain why they have chosen to do that.
This concern aside, I am happy to recommend publication and look forward to seeing this in print - it
will be a valuable contribution to the literature.

>>We are grateful to Dr. James Gilbert for constructive comments and useful suggestions that have
helped us to improve our manuscript considerably. In this revision, we have revised our statistical
reporting again. As shown in the text (P. 8, Line 8-11), we removed ALL interactions (P > 0.05)
from the model and made new ESM 2 (AIC comparing among models) and 3 (initial full model).
The new results became clearer and more robust as compared to the results of the previous version.
We would like to acknowledge the insightful comments.
