Mokkapati et. al. give a contradictory report regarding the anti-bacterial activity of graphene,
graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). However, non-anti-bacterial activity is
barely justified by these evidences simply. Thus, the manuscript in its present form is not ready
yet for publication in Royal Society Open Science. The authors need address the following points
before further submission.
1) The anti-bacterial activity of GO and rGO depend on their content in agar. Low content of GO
and rGO can hardly show the anti-bacterial activity. How about the agar with high content of GO
and rGO?
2) How to prepared the agar plates with GO and rGO? During the preparing of agar plates? High
temperature (above 80oC) is required to dissolve the agar plates, in which GO and rGO reunite
easily. If not, how to control the uniform of GO and rGO in agar plates.
3) As shown in Figure 3 and Figure 5, bacterial biofilm area is much smaller when concentration
of GO and rGO is higher, verifying the anti-bacterial activity of GO and rGO.
4) As shown in Figure 4, the amount of B. subtilis in Day 1 is much higher than in Figure 3.

In this paper, the author studied the anti-bacterial activity of graphene oxide and reduced
graphene oxide against Bacillus subtilisand and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It was found that rGO
3
was toxic to both Bacillus subtilisand and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas GO is not. The
manuscript still needs to be markedly improved before acceptance.
1<U+3001>When P. aeruginosa treated GO was isolated and tested for ATR-FTIR, the author claim
that they couldn’t detect any rGO, which is attributed to the few quantities of rGO. The
conclusion are not convincing enough. Why the author didn’t try another characterization
technique. Such as raman.
2<U+3001> The author claim that initially P. aeruginosacells on GO integrated in agar plates started to
proliferate, and were unaffected for the first 24 hours. With higher concentration of GO and
longer time, bacterial growth became limited. But B. subtilis is resistant to GO. Wherther it is
possible that the threshold value of B. subtilis is larger. When the concentration of GO or time
was further increased, bacterial growth for B. subtilis may be limited.
3<U+3001>Figure 2 should be reprepared. The y-coordinate has no units. In addition, the position of the
mark in diagram is not appropriate. In the paper,all the figure didn’t mark “A, B…” The readers
can't understand the meaning clearly.
4<U+3001>There are many gramma errors. The language has to be polished. In addition, there are a lot of
unit problems. Such as “2µl” “300µg/ml”

Comments to the Author(s)
Mokkapati et. al. give a contradictory report regarding the anti-bacterial
activity of graphene, graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO).
However, non-anti-bacterial activity is barely justified by these evidences
simply. Thus, the manuscript in its present form is not ready yet for
publication in Royal Society Open Science. The authors need address the
following points before further submission.
1) The anti-bacterial activity of GO and rGO depend on their content in
agar. Low content of GO and rGO can hardly show the anti-bacterial
activity. How about the agar with high content of GO and rGO?
The authors would appreciate this valuable comment. It is true that the anti-
bacterial activity depends on the content of GO and rGO and in this regard we
also have prepared GO and rGO integrated agar plates with up to 0.8% (10
times higher concentrations than the reported ones). We have observed that
GO and rGO at higher concentrations aggregate and form islands on the agar
(image below shows an example of the prepared rGO integrated agar plates).
Due to this, we may not be able to completely rely on the obtained data
because the bacteria on the aggregates and in the inter-aggregate part would
react differently. This was the main reason for not going beyond the
concentrations of 0.08%. On the other hand, the stock GO and rGO that was
used for these experiments is highly concentrated (6 grams/L).
2) How to prepared the agar plates with GO and rGO? During the
preparing of agar plates? High temperature (above 80oC) is required to
dissolve the agar plates, in which GO and rGO reunite easily. If not, how to
control the uniform of GO and rGO in agar plates.
We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment. We have briefly discussed
this concern and the troubleshooting process under Preparation of agar
plates with GO/rGO. To elaborate, once the agar, tryptone and yeast extract
were mixed in the di-water, the solution was autoclaved. Separately, in
different glass bottles GO and rGO were taken in different concentrations.
Immediately after the autoclave process was finished (the temperature would
be around 800C), the agar solution was equally distributed in different glass
bottles (50 ml each) and different concentrations of the pre-prepared GO and
rGO solutions of different concentrations were added to these glass bottles
and left under continuous shaking in a standard incubator (this is to avoid the
solidification of agar immediately and for the mixing of GO/rGO with agar).
These samples were left for approximately 10 mins under shaking followed by
pouring the solution in to the petri plates and solidifying them.
Basically, we do have a margin of 20-25 mins from post-autoclave to
solidification of the agar and we make use of this time frame to integrate
GO/rGO in to the plates.
3) As shown in Figure 3 and Figure 5, bacterial biofilm area is much
smaller when concentration of GO and rGO is higher, verifying the anti-
bacterial activity of GO and rGO.
4) As shown in Figure 4, the amount of B. subtilis in Day 1 is much
higher than in Figure 3. Photograph of B. subtilis colonies cultivated in first
half day are highly required.
We thank the reviewer for pointing out this error where the control of B.
subtilis colony in figure 4 was much higher than the one in figure 3. We have
repeated the experiment to understand where the error was and it was
realized that it was an experimental error during sub-inoculation of bacterial
suspension on agar plate. The manuscript has been updated with new figure.
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we
have repeated the experiment and acquired
images for first 8 hours of bacterial growth
which shows significantly smaller colony
compared to 24 hours culture.

Comments to the Author(s)
In this paper, the author studied the anti-bacterial activity of graphene oxide
and reduced graphene oxide against Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. It was found that rGO was toxic to both Bacillus subtilis and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas GO is not. The manuscript still needs to
be markedly improved before acceptance.
1<U+3001>When P. aeruginosa treated GO was isolated and tested for ATR-
FTIR, the author claim that they couldn’t detect any rGO, which is
attributed to the few quantities of rGO. The conclusion are not convincing
enough. Why the author didn’t try another characterization technique. Such
as raman.
The authors appreciate this comment by the reviewer. Infact, our initial
characterization technique was RAMAN and when it didn’t work, we switched
to FTIR. When we tried to characterize the agar + rGO samples with RAMAN,
we have come across 2 main issues:
1. During RAMAN characterization, the intensity of laser was melting the agar
+ rGO and there was no consistency in the data we were recording.
2. When characterized with less intensity there was a variable shift with D
and G peaks and 2D peak was not even detected.
For this reason, we tried to detect the rGO content using FTIR.
2. The author claim that initially P. aeruginosa cells on GO integrated in agar
plates started to proliferate, and were unaffected for the first 24 hours.
With higher concentration of GO and longer time, bacterial growth became
limited. But B. subtilis is resistant to GO. Wherther it is possible that the
threshold value of B. subtilis is larger. When the concentration of GO or
time was further increased, bacterial growth for B. subtilis may be limited.
Following up with the reviewer’s comment that with increasing GO
concentrations and/or time, B. subtilis growth might be limited; but as can be
seen from the cultured plates, after 5 days the plates are already saturated
with bacterial colonies and there is no further space for the bacteria to grow
reaching a spacial threshold. We also have repeated these experiments with
bigger plates and the result has been the same.
In this case the main comparison is between the control of B. subtilis and B.
subtilis colonies on GO after 5 days which clearly shows that the control has
smaller colonies compared to the cultures after 5 days.
On the other hand as explained in the manuscript text (page 3 reference 19),
P. aeruginosa can reduce GO to rGO without the help of any redox mediator
unlike B. subtilis which needs a redox mediator. This immediate reduction by
P. aeruginosa is also the major cause for the anti-bacterial activity of GO
towards P. aeruginosa.
3. Figure 2 should be reprepared. The y-coordinate has no units. In addition,
the position of the mark in diagram is not appropriate. In the paper,all the
figure didn’t mark “A, B…” The readers can't understand the meaning
clearly.
Figure 2 has been re-prepared and the corrections have been made according
to the reviewer’s recommendation. Where necessary, the figures are marked
with a, b and c and the same has been updated within the manuscript.
4. There are many gramma errors. The language has to be polished. In
addition, there are a lot of unit problems. Such as “2µl” “300µg/ml”
The language has been thoroughly checked and the corrections are
highlighted.
