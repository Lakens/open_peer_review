This is a well-produced, well-researched and interesting paper on the genomics of mouse
hybridization in New Zealand. Only two very minor things to do:
The reference list needs to be formatted in a consistent way appropriate for the journal.

Veale and collaborators present an study of the genetic diversity in house mice in New Zealand
using a large set of samples (the majority of them coming from previous studies) widely
distributed and a genotyping array with a very large number of markers. The resulting data are
compared to publicly available data sets. The study shows a complex history of admixture of
divergent lineages resulting in mice predominantly with M. m. domesticus genes, but with
extensive and introgression of M. m. musculus and M. m. castaneus in some regions and
practically complete replacement of mitochondrial DNA sequences in other regions. There results
are very interesting and attractive, specially those shown in Figures 3 and 4. Unfortunately, the
paper seems written for readers in New Zealand and people like me, that have never been there,
may have a hard to follow the study.
The text refers to lots of sampling locations, regions and islands and it is very difficult to get a
general picture by reading the results and discussion. I had to read each paragraph several times,
often looking at maps at the same time and doing internet searches. If I was not reviewer for this
paper, I doubt that I would have had the patience to read it. I would encourage the authors to
dramatically reduce the length of the Results and Discussion sections. Instead of focusing on
single localities I would recommend discussing more general patterns in the maps in Figure 4
(almost not cited in the text) and the results presented in Figure 3. I think that the text could gain
3
in interest without loosing any of the main results if the length of these sections was just 1/3 of
the current length.
Another major concern refers to the study of runs of homozygosity ROH. The analyses do not
provide enough information to understand what is going on. I was expecting that these runs of
homozygosity would be defined, for example, as runs of a minimum number of SNPs, spanning
at least XXX kb, found in homozygous state (or with 1 or less heterozygous SNPs). It is not clear
what the authors take as minimum possible length, how they deal with missing data or variable
spacing between markers … In addition, the results are very difficult to understand. Assuming
that the mouse genome is about 2.8x10e9 bp, the results presented are surprising:
-Total length of the runs of homozygosity for one individual was more than half of the entire
genome (1.5x10e6 kb = 1.5x10e9 bp). This would be expected only in cases of extremely inbred
populations (fullsib matings for several generations) … or deficient genotyping resulting in many
missing alleles.
-Average ROH size > 5000 kb (= 5x10e6) for ten individuals. This also seems exceedingly large for
natural populations of mice.
These weird results make me think about problems with the genotyping, possible ascertainment
bias (what individuals gave very long ROH?) or very small and inbred populations (but this is
not what the population structure analyses suggest).
In addition ROH are the result of recent inbreeding and also effective population size. This means
that a partially isolated population can have very long ROH independently of a recent or ancient
origin. I think that the relationship between ROH and founding / dispersal is not clear. This is
specially the case when very divergent lineages (not only referring to subspecies, but also
lineages of different origin within M. m. domesticus) can have arrived at different times and ROH
are heavily impacted by this population diversity. Consequently, I do not think that low ROH can
be taken as evidence of a low founding population instead of lower admixture between lineages.
I think that the authors should explain very carefully how can they interpret founding history
from ROH. At this point this sounds like speculation and I would suggest deleting all text
referring to ROH. Given the small sample size per location, and the dubious interpretation of
ROH, a large part of the discussion sounds like speculation.
Multiple datasets are used for the analyses. The logic of using the different datasets is nicely
explained in Material and Methods. However, It is not completely clear what dataset is used for
the different analyses in Results. This needs to be clearly explained. For example, in “Results /
Data filtering and statistics” the authors say “...leaving the most differentiated 9,501 SNPs for
high-accuracy subspecies genomic assignment, and these were scattered across all chromosomes
(Supplementary Table ST2)”. However, this supplementary table contains information about
more than 12,400 loci. Also it seems that ADMIXTURE was run with different datasets, but the
results are only shown for one.
The authors infer completely different founding histories for three islands that appear
differentiated in Figure 3a (Chatham, Antipodes, Auckland). However, strong drift due to small
population size can lead to differentiation even in populations of very recent origin from a closely
related one. Also, these analyses can be affected by the sample size for each population. This
could explain weird results (from my point of view, just based on looking at maps and
information in Google) such as the very large difference between Chatham and Pitt islands (it is
hard for me to imagine that the history of these two populations may be independent from each
other). Inference of very different demographic histories should be based on more robust
analyses.
Trying to identify the populations of origin of M. m. domesticus implies a more extensive survey
and population structure than is shown in this study. Inferences about the origin of the lineages
in New Zealand would need information to show the quality and coverage of the reference
samples. Without this information it is difficult to assess the reliability of the inferences.

Other comments:
-In the introduction, the discussion about previous results of studies on New Zealand mice using
just a few markers seems that could be very much shorter.
-Please, indicate initial sample size in the section “Materials and Methods/Sample collection”
-In the second paragraph in section “Materials and Methods / Bioinformatic filtering and
analyses” the authors say “Once merged, for both of these datasets we then filtered for a
MAXIMUM minor allele frequency of 0.05.” Should it be MINIMUM instead of maximum? This
is particularly confusing because in the same paragraph they also say “This takes values between
0 and 1 and reaches its maximum value for a site with minor-allele frequency 0.5 ...” This is not
possible if the maximum minor allele frequency has to be lower than 0.05. The filtering is not
clear.
-In this same paragraph the authors should try to improve the explanation of the measure of
information content.
-Supplementary Tables and figures do not have captions / legends.
-Supplementary Figure SF3 not provided
-Is it possible to provide any short of confidence interval to the estimate of the proportion of the
genome deriving from each subspecies for each one of the studied samples?

Associate Editor's comments:
While reviewer 1 fully agrees with the manuscript, reviewer 2 listed several major concerns. One
point is the length of the manuscript and the difficulty to get acquainted with the geography of
the sampling sites. I also found that this diminishes the pleasure of reading this interesting
manuscript, and hope that the authors find a way to summarize the genetic structure and other
results in a manner that is accessible to non-locals. Perhaps it would be possible to provide some
of the details in a supplementary text.
Similarly, the chronology of New Zealand mouse research (currently part of the introduction)
could be provided as a supplementary text, while the information available prior to the current
study could be summarized more briefly in the introduction.
Other major issues of Reviewer 2 concern the ROH results and their interpretation with regard to
founding history, the inferences regarding populations of origin, and missing information on
methods. Please address all points raised by the reviewer carefully in your revision.

Veale et al present a revised version of their paper. I think that the new version is very
understandable and I appreciate the efforts to clarify geographical aspects for readers (such as
myself) that do not know New Zealand.
I think that the text is ready to be published and I only indicate here a small number of minor
corrections:
-Sample collection, line 5: Insert "mitochondrial" before "control region"
-Data filtering and statistics, line 2: replace "sequenced" by "analyzed"
-Genetic population structure, end of 3rd paragraph: I think that the authors should acknowledge
that clusters do not necessarily imply different introduction events and they could also derive
from a period of relative isolation.
-Page 7, 3rd paragraph, 4th line: Could "sterility" be used instead of "infertility"
-Page 8, 2nd paragraph: "All mice in New Zealand other than those on Antipodes and Auckland
Islands genetically clustered together with each other (and with Sydney, Australia), indicating
similar origins, or significant mixing among locations post introduction." As far as I can see, mice
from Antipodes and Auckland islands cluster with the other mice.
-Page 8, line 3 from bottom: "the discordance between the same two subspecies runs in the

-The Editor should decide if the text should be reduced in length. I think that the sections
"Limitations of the Gigamuga SNP array" and "Future directions" could be completely removed.
It also feels that the rest of the discussion could be significantly reduced to 1/2 of the current
length, but the current text is easy to read and nice.

Appendix A
Dear Dr Power,
Thank you kindly for your comments and encouragement. We have significantly altered the manuscript
to address the points raised by yourself and the reviewers. The primary analytical issue brought up by
the reviewers (Reviewer 2) is the difficulty and complexity in interpreting the Runs of Homozygosity
analyses. Reviewer 2 recommended that we remove this analysis, due to this difficulty, and the already
large size of the manuscript. We agree that this is a complex area with many interpretations, and
therefore we have agreed to remove these analyses – seeing that a more thorough analysis of ROHs is
probably warranted, and difficult to do without greatly expanding the present manuscript.
Beyond this, both you and Reviewer 2 pointed to the difficulty in reading the manuscript without more
information on the geography and the over-arching trends. We have completely re-written the results
and discussion and added a figure so that readers less familiar with the region can follow the relatively
complex story with greater ease.
We have also edited the introduction cutting a lot of the detail of the history of previous studies in the
region, while keeping a more succinct summary of the present knowledge. Similarly, the results and
discussion have been cut down and made more succinct. We kept a section in the discussion featuring
relatively specific details regarding the probable invasion routes to some locations, and while we
acknowledge that this is relatively specific information, we feel it is going to be interesting to many
readers, and that it is supported by the data – with appropriate caveats in terms of interpreting the
historical record and the genetic signals.
Overall, I think the manuscript is greatly improved for your inputs, and we hope that we have
adequately addressed the points and can move forward to publish in your journal.
Thank you for this opportunity and your help.
Dr Andrew Veale
Below are the specific points brought up, and our responses to them:
Dear Dr Veale,
Associate Editor's comments:
While reviewer 1 fully agrees with the manuscript, reviewer 2 listed several major concerns. One point is
the length of the manuscript and the difficulty to get acquainted with the geography of the sampling
sites. I also found that this diminishes the pleasure of reading this interesting manuscript, and hope that
the authors find a way to summarize the genetic structure and other results in a manner that is
accessible to non-locals. Perhaps it would be possible to provide some of the details in a supplementary
text.
Similarly, the chronology of New Zealand mouse research (currently part of the introduction) could be
provided as a supplementary text, while the information available prior to the current study could be
summarized more briefly in the introduction.
Response: We have reduced this section to half the size, summarising more briefly the current state of
knowledge. (Page 2 line 36 – page 3 line 2)
Other major issues of Reviewer 2 concern the ROH results and their interpretation with regard to
founding history, the inferences regarding populations of origin, and missing information on methods.
Please address all points raised by the reviewer carefully in your revision.

This is a well-produced, well-researched and interesting paper on the genomics of mouse hybridization
in New Zealand. Only two very minor things to do:
The reference list needs to be formatted in a consistent way appropriate for the journal.
Page 7, line 46: "is" rather than "in"
Response: Thank you, both issues are now fixed.

Comments to the Author(s)
Veale and collaborators present an study of the genetic diversity in house mice in New Zealand using a
large set of samples (the majority of them coming from previous studies) widely distributed and a
genotyping array with a very large number of markers. The resulting data are compared to publicly
available data sets. The study shows a complex history of admixture of divergent lineages resulting in
mice predominantly with M. m. domesticus genes, but with extensive and introgression of M. m.
musculus and M. m. castaneus in some regions and practically complete replacement of mitochondrial
DNA sequences in other regions. There results are very interesting and attractive, specially those shown
in Figures 3 and 4. Unfortunately, the paper seems written for readers in New Zealand and people like
me, that have never been there, may have a hard to follow the study.
The text refers to lots of sampling locations, regions and islands and it is very difficult to get a general
picture by reading the results and discussion. I had to read each paragraph several times, often looking
at maps at the same time and doing internet searches. If I was not reviewer for this paper, I doubt that
I would have had the patience to read it. I would encourage the authors to dramatically reduce the
length of the Results and Discussion sections. Instead of focusing on single localities I would recommend
discussing more general patterns in the maps in Figure 4 (almost not cited in the text) and the results
presented in Figure 3. I think that the text could gain in interest without losing any of the main results if
the length of these sections was just 1/3 of the current length.
Another major concern refers to the study of runs of homozygosity ROH. The analyses do not provide
enough information to understand what is going on. I was expecting that these runs of homozygosity
would be defined, for example, as runs of a minimum number of SNPs, spanning at least XXX kb, found
in homozygous state (or with 1 or less heterozygous SNPs). It is not clear what the authors take as
minimum possible length, how they deal with missing data or variable spacing between markers … In
addition, the results are very difficult to understand. Assuming that the mouse genome is about
2.8x10e9 bp, the results presented are surprising:
-Total length of the runs of homozygosity for one individual was more than half of the entire genome
(1.5x10e6 kb = 1.5x10e9 bp). This would be expected only in cases of extremely inbred populations
(fullsib matings for several generations) … or deficient genotyping resulting in many missing alleles.
-Average ROH size > 5000 kb (= 5x10e6) for ten individuals. This also seems exceedingly large for
natural populations of mice.
Response: As recommended, we have decided to remove the ROH analyses based on the reviewer’s
comments, so that we can perform a more thorough analysis of these results. We do however feel given
the extremely low missing data from genotyping, and consistent patterns of ROHs within each
population that these analyses and patterns are indicative of demographic histories (along with mixing of
lineages as suggested). These are not ‘natural populations’ in terms of demographic histories as the
reviewer suggests. Many of these island populations must have been heavily bottlenecked on ships
coming from Europe for months or years, and for some islands, very few mice from a single shipwreck,
or from row boats with sealing gangs which will have founded the populations. Inbreeding equivalent of
full-sib matings for several generations would not surprise us under these circumstances. These points
however will be addressed in a separate manuscript in the future.
These weird results make me think about problems with the genotyping, possible ascertainment bias
(what individuals gave very long ROH?) or very small and inbred populations (but this is not what the
population structure analyses suggest).
In addition ROH are the result of recent inbreeding and also effective population size. This means that a
partially isolated population can have very long ROH independently of a recent or ancient origin. I think
that the relationship between ROH and founding / dispersal is not clear. This is specially the case when
very divergent lineages (not only referring to subspecies, but also lineages of different origin within M.
m. domesticus) can have arrived at different times and ROH are heavily impacted by this population
diversity. Consequently, I do not think that low ROH can be taken as evidence of a low founding
population instead of lower admixture between lineages. I think that the authors should explain very
carefully how can they interpret founding history from ROH. At this point this sounds like speculation
and I would suggest deleting all text referring to ROH. Given the small sample size per location, and the
dubious interpretation of ROH, a large part of the discussion sounds like speculation.
Response: We agree with the reviewer that ROH will be affected by the mixing of lineages, and about
the complexity of interpreting these results. Given the size and complexity of the paper already we have
removed these analyses as advised to do a more thorough analysis of this data in a subsequent paper.
Multiple datasets are used for the analyses. The logic of using the different datasets is nicely explained
in Material and Methods. However, It is not completely clear what dataset is used for the different
analyses in Results. This needs to be clearly explained. For example, in “Results / Data filtering and
statistics” the authors say “...leaving the most differentiated 9,501 SNPs for high-accuracy subspecies
genomic assignment, and these were scattered across all chromosomes (Supplementary Table ST2)”.
However, this supplementary table contains information about more than 12,400 loci. Also it seems that
ADMIXTURE was run with different datasets, but the results are only shown for one.
Response: Good point well spotted on the different number of loci. The Supplementary table contained
all of the loci identified by Morgan et al as having a Shannon Index of 0.5 or greater, however our data
was filtered beyond this for coverage and linkage, reducing the dataset from 12,400 to 9,501. This error
has now been corrected.
The authors infer completely different founding histories for three islands that appear differentiated in
Figure 3a (Chatham, Antipodes, Auckland). However, strong drift due to small population size can lead
to differentiation even in populations of very recent origin from a closely related one. Also, these
analyses can be affected by the sample size for each population. This could explain weird results (from
my point of view, just based on looking at maps and information in Google) such as the very large
difference between Chatham and Pitt islands (it is hard for me to imagine that the history of these two
populations may be independent from each other). Inference of very different demographic histories
should be based on more robust analyses.
Response: While some of these results are indeed unusual, they are well supported by multiple lines of
reasoning. For instance, the difference between Chatham and Pitt Islands is well known from previous
studies. King et al. 2016 found no shared mitochondrial haplotypes between these islands, and in fact all
mice from Chatham Island had M. m. castaneus mitochondria while all from Pitt Island have M. m.
domesticus. While they are close geographically being only 25km apart, they have different and irregular
shipping patterns, and they clearly have genetically distinct mouse populations. For all of these islands
we infer different histories not solely based on high genetic differentiation, but on where these mice
clade on the phylogenetic trees, which are based on regions of identity by state, and also by
mitochondrial haplotypes. Almost certainly genetic drift in the small founding populations have affected
these populations, but genetic drift won’t have made them resemble mice from elsewhere. More
discussion of these results has been added. Page 8 – line 38 – page 9 line 19.
Trying to identify the populations of origin of M. m. domesticus implies a more extensive survey and
population structure than is shown in this study. Inferences about the origin of the lineages in New
Zealand would need information to show the quality and coverage of the reference samples. Without this
information it is difficult to assess the reliability of the inferences.
Response: These interpretations are largely based on the PCA analyses, and Admixture analyses, and in
particular the Neighbour Joining trees – featured in the Supplementary Material. These trees are based
on Identity by State regions between individuals and should be a good representation of overall genetic
relatedness. Ideally, we would include these trees in the body of the manuscript, but given the size of
them this is impractical, therefore having them in the Supp materials at full size is more useful. We have
also removed some of the speculation in the discussion, and addressed the uncertainties in these
assessments to a greater degree.
Other comments:
-In the introduction, the discussion about previous results of studies on New Zealand mice using just a
few markers seems that could be very much shorter.
Response: This has been edited down significantly.
-Please, indicate initial sample size in the section “Materials and Methods/Sample collection”
Response: Added, Page 3 line 8
-In the second paragraph in section “Materials and Methods / Bioinformatic filtering and analyses” the
authors say “Once merged, for both of these datasets we then filtered for a MAXIMUM minor allele
frequency of 0.05.” Should it be MINIMUM instead of maximum? This is particularly confusing because in
the same paragraph they also say “This takes values between 0 and 1 and reaches its maximum value
for a site with minor-allele frequency 0.5 ...” This is not possible if the maximum minor allele frequency
has to be lower than 0.05. The filtering is not clear.
Response: As the reviewer points out, we meant minimum minor allele frequency, somehow this slipped
through – fixed, page 3 line 39.
-In this same paragraph the authors should try to improve the explanation of the measure of
information content.
Response: Done Page 3 line 43 – 45.
-Supplementary Tables and figures do not have captions / legends.
Response: Fixed
-Supplementary Figure SF3 not provided
Good point, now added.
-Is it possible to provide any short of confidence interval to the estimate of the proportion of the genome
deriving from each subspecies for each one of the studied samples?
Response: Sadly not, the outputs of Amixture are single estimates so for a given individual there is only
one number. While there may be some error in these methods, we use and report several estimates –
both from ‘diagnostic’ SNPs and from the Admixture model results. Both methods converge on low
amounts of ancestry from M. m. musculus and M. m. castaneus across all individuals, with the exception
of those in the upper South Island as noted.
Appendix B
Dear Dr Power
Thank you for accepting the manuscript, below we discuss the final revisions recommended and
undertaken:
-Sample collection, line 5: Insert "mitochondrial" before "control region"
Done
-Data filtering and statistics, line 2: replace "sequenced" by "analyzed"
Done
-Genetic population structure, end of 3rd paragraph: I think that the authors should acknowledge that
clusters do not necessarily imply different introduction events and they could also derive from a period
of relative isolation.
Added a short statement to this affect.
-Page 7, 3rd paragraph, 4th line: Could "sterility" be used instead of "infertility"
Sterility is generally referring to a complete lack of ability to conceive, while infertility infers more of a
gradient with decreased reproductive success. I think our results indicate infertility is the more
appropriate term - though potentially some genetic combinations may be completely sterile.
-Page 8, 2nd paragraph: "All mice in New Zealand other than those on Antipodes and Auckland Islands
genetically clustered together with each other (and with Sydney, Australia), indicating similar origins, or
significant mixing among locations post introduction." As far as I can see, mice from Antipodes and
Auckland islands cluster with the other mice.
This statement is referring to the trees as described in the results and displayed in the supplementary
figures. This link has now been reiterated in the discussion with this statement.
-Page 8, line 3 from bottom: "the discordance between the same two subspecies runs in the opposite
direction". Seems the same to me.
No, the previous paragraph was about populations with M. m. castaneus mitochondrial DNA but no
nuclear ancestry, this population has traces of M. m. castaneus nuclear ancestry but no mitochondrial
ancestry. This is now further explained.
-The Editor should decide if the text should be reduced in length. I think that the sections "Limitations of
the Gigamuga SNP array" and "Future directions" could be completely removed. It also feels that the
rest of the discussion could be significantly reduced to 1/2 of the current length, but the current text is
easy to read and nice.
I have reduced the size of the Limitations section, though we feel that keeping it is informative to
readers both showing the need for caution in similar studies, and in using our data for future analyses.
The future directions section is important, as it clearly outlines what is still to know and how to do this,
and the potential applications of the work.
