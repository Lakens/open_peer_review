In the manuscript presented by Wang et al., the authors investigate the best spreading strategy on
scale-free networks composed of different number of nodes and hubs. They have also proposed
some new hybrid strategies utilizing from the advantages of well-known strategies (LS and SL).
Their results indicate that the proposed hybrid strategies are effective and efficient for spreading
information in scale-free networks.
The topic of this manuscript is of importance, the results presented in this manuscript are
interested and the statistical analysis could be reliable, but some minor points stated below
should be addressed conscientiously.
1-The authors should give the degree distribution of the networks on double logarithmic scale for
a better presentation. In literature, the presentation trend for degree distribution is log-log scale.
2-What are the average degrees of the networks composed of different vertices numbers? In my
opinion, it will be better that the author present the results demonstrating the effects of average
degree instead of hub numbers. In case of hub numbers, what are the degrees of the hubs? It will
be better to use well-known scale-free networks algorithm ( Barabasi-Albert algorithm ) instead
of Anylogic software.
3-In the manuscript the author state that in 2000 people network, the hub numbers are 4,6 and 8.
But in Fig.5 it is 6,9, and 12. There is an inconsistency.
4-The experimental setup should be given in detail. How the authors measure the Frequency
count depending on bin center or convergence time?
5-It is interesting that while the best strategy is changing with the increasing of hub number,
convergence time decreases with the increasing hub number. What can be the reason behind this
result?

Comment:
In addition to the reviewers' comments could you also provide more
details on Anylogic software that you have used for the experiments,
especially which version have you used and if your experiments can be
recreated with free available version. Could you also give more details
on parameters in Anylogic that you have used for creating your
networks and running the simulations.
Response:
Thank you so much for your comments. The Anylogic is a half-open
source software based on Java. Some Java API documents in Anylogic
can be used to build the multi-agent model, and we need to build
algorithms for our model in most situations. We have purchased the
version of Anylogic for University Researcher, and we can publish the
relevant research papers in which the Anylogic is used to conduct the
experiments.
The Personal Learning Edition of Anylogic is completely free for
students. And the features that are required for recreating our
experiments are all available in the Personal, Free version of Anylogic.
So, interested researchers can use this free version to repeat all the
experiments. In addition, the developed model using Anylogic will be
submitted with the raw data for the public usage.
We have described more details on parameters of our experiments in
the manuscript, and the revised parts can be seen in Subsection 3.2.2
and Section 4.

Comment # 1:
The authors should give the degree distribution of the networks on
double logarithmic scale for a better presentation. In literature, the
presentation trend for degree distribution is log-log scale.
Response:
First, thank you so much for giving this very critical and valuable
comment!
This is definitely a great idea! And we revised those figures on
single logarithmic scale (i.e., the y-axis). It is because that, we find
that the figures on y-logarithmic scale are more clear. See Figure R1.
And the example figure on double-logarithmic scale can be seen in
Figure R2.

Comment # 2:
What are the average degrees of the networks composed of
different vertices numbers? In my opinion, it will be better that the
author present the results demonstrating the effects of average degree
instead of hub numbers. In case of hub numbers, what are the degrees
of the hubs?
Response:
The average degrees of the networks can be seen in Table R1.
With the increasing of hub number, the average degrees of networks
are increased, and the average degrees cannot be affected by the
increasing of network size. Theoretically, the average degrees of
network synthesize the effects of network size and hub number,
however, the average degrees do not perform the effects of network
size, and we want to know the effects of network size and number of
hub, respectively. In addition, the hub number is a parameter in our
experiments, it is reasonable to present the results demonstrating the
effects of hub number.

In the case of hub number, the degrees of hubs are different in
different simulations of a Monte Carlo experiment, and we calculate
the average degrees of the hubs in a Monte Carlo experiment. Table
R2 represents the average degrees of hubs. We can find that: (1) with
the increasing of the hub number, the average degrees of hubs are
increased; (2) with the increasing of the network size, the average
degrees of hubs are increased.

Comment # 3:
It will be better to use well-known scale-free networks algorithm
( Barabasi-Albert algorithm ) instead of Anylogic software.
Response:
It is fine to use the well-known scale-free networks algorithm
(Barabasi-Albert algorithm), and the primary reasons that we use the
scale-free network instead of the BA model as follows:
(1) The typical characteristics of the BA model are (a) the Growth
and (b) the Preferentially Attachment, and the initial network in the BA
model is un-known, we cannot ensure that the characteristics of the
scale-free network are apparent and typical when the network size is
500 people, 1000 people and 2000 people, respectively. And the
scale-free network with any size can be generated in Anylogic, and the
characteristics of the scale-free networks are apparent and typical.
(2) The scale-free networks which are generated in Anylogic have
the typical characteristics of therotical scale-free networks. It is
reasonable to use those scale-free networks which are generated in
Anylogic to conduct experiments. In addition, we could rapidly
generate a series of scale-free networks by setting the number of hubs
and the network size which are the primary parameters in our
experiments.
Comment # 4:
In the manuscript the author state that in 2000 people network, the
hub numbers are 4,6 and 8. But in Fig.5 it is 6,9, and 12. There is an
inconsistency.
Response:
There are several mistakes in Figure 5 of the manuscript, and we
have revised it.
Comment # 5:
The experimental setup should be given in detail. How the authors
measure the Frequency count depending on bin center or convergence
time?
Response:
We have revised the experimental setup in the manuscript, and the
revised part can be seen in Section 4.
The Monte Carlo experiment in Anylogic can automatically
generate a frequency distribution of convergence time according to the
results of all simulations in each Monte Carlo experiment. When the
convergence time of a simulation is in the scope of an interval of the
frequency distribution, the corresponding frequency count will be
added 1.
Comment # 6:
It is interesting that while the best strategy is changing with the
increasing of hub number, convergence time decreases with the
increasing hub number. What can be the reason behind this result?
Response:
For the phenomenon that the best strategy is changing with the
increasing of hub number, it is possibly caused by the change of
connections between vertices. The first step of our proposed hybrid
strategy is to sort all vertices by degree in descending order, and with
the increasing of hub number, for the top 20% or 50% vertices, the
number of connections is increased, and the increasing is more
significant than the increasing of connection number for the other
vertices. That means, the difference of connection numbers between
the top 20% or 50% vertices and the other vertices becomes bigger, the
fitted curve of degree distribution becomes steeper. In this case: (1) the
diffusion of the top 20% or 50% become stronger, and (2) the
consumed time for spreading the small-degree vertices is increased.
The best strategy is capable of evaluating the balance of the two
changes. When the effect of the first change is stronger than the effect
of the second change, the LSSL strategy is more efficient. On the
contrary, the SLLS strategy is more efficient.
For the phenomenon that the convergence time decreases with the
increasing hub number, it is also possibly caused by the change of
connections between vertices. With the increasing of hub number, we
have known that the connection number of the top 20% or 50% is
increased, and the connection number of the other vertices is also
increased, that means, the connection number of vertices in the
network is increased with the increasing of hub number. And the
spreading is obviously faster when there are more connections in the
network.
