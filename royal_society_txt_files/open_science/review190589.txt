This manuscript outlines the exploitation of two-photon excitation (TPE) and adaptive optics
(AO) for imaging fluorescent nanodiamonds (NDs). It presents, in relatively clear terms (and
language that is accessible), the advantage of combining these three components to well-surpass
the diffraction limit. By adopting the SRRF approach to image analysis, the authors emphasise the
importance of proper aberration correction for achieving the promised super resolution. I would
like the authors to address the following points.
Minor concerns:
1. Line 7 of page 3 outlines the benefits of AO by citing 3 papers. In comparison to the benefits of
TPE outlined in the previous page, this section does not adequately introduce the principles or
the applications of AO, particularly to the naïve reader.
2. Line 22 of page 7: What are the specifications of the coverslips used?
3. Line 42 of page 7: The authors equate the optical fibre in the emission light path to an effective
pinhole. What is the effective pinhole size? Does this do anything to improve the contrast of the
recorded image?
4. The description of the optical path and the deformable mirrors have been described briefly in
the text. A schematic diagram (in the form of a supplement) would be useful for a non-specialist
reader.
5. Looking at the raw data for Figure 1, it looks as though the structures in the TPE images are
better-shaped (more compact and less ringing) compared to SPE. Why is this?
Major concerns:
1. I appreciate that the authors use the in-built drift correction function in NanoJ. For the benefit
of those who are not familiar with NanoJ, it is perhaps important to outline how this correction
works. The raw daw that have been shared appear to drift by 90+ nm. What is the limit of drift
tolerance with this approach?
2. The Fourier ring correlation (FRC) has been used to characterise the improvement in the
resolution gained through the aberration correction in the primary data used for SRRF. FRC,
however, is also very sensitive to drift. Were these datasets corrected for drift before splitting into
two independent time-stacks for SRRF?
General considerations:
1. The authors outline the potential issues of photobleaching in using (conventional) fluorophores
in combination with TPE and AO. Demonstrating this point through a side-by-side comparison
with a bleach-susceptible marker (e.g. fluorescent latex microspheres) would have added value in
demonstrating this point, particularly to readers who are not familiar with NDs. The lack of this
comparison however does not diminish the validity of the point made in this manuscript.
2. The authors conclude that this methodology offers strong promise for super-resolution
imaging biological samples. It would have been more confidence inspiring to see an application
of this. From the text of the paper, I gather this to be a future development planned by the
authors.

label_comment_2
The manuscript by Johnstone, Cairns and Patton describes the use of nanodiamond as a
fluorophore in 2photon imaging, also demonstrating super-resolution imaging via the SRRF
technique. The manuscript is well written and referenced, and contains interesting experimental
findings. There is a high level of consideration given to understanding the results, which is
refreshing. The work is well suited to RS Open Science and I would recommend it for
publication. I have several points that the authors may wish to comment on:
1. In the conclusion, it states “Furthermore, we demonstate that its photostability gives it
significant advantages when performing adaptive-optics or computational super-resolution
images.” In fact, I couldn’t see any data in the manuscript on photostability, which should really
be added, rather than just asserted.
2. Page 8, line 51. The authors say that they correct for in-plane sample drift, they should give
what this value typically is- this will give some indication of the z drift present, which will
probably be at least as bad. On an associated theme, it would be useful to state the acquisition
time for 100 frames.
3. Figure 4 shows a 2d slice the two photon PSF. While in this system, it does correspond to the
TPE PSF, this could be slightly misleading as this microscope is highly unusual for a two photon
system in that it has a confocal pinhole for the detection. This is particularly the case when
demonstrating the adaptive optics addition of aberration, since the DM adds the astigmatism in
the detection path also.
4. The 4x enhancement of the emission in the two-photon excitation is very interesting. Is it
definitely the same isolated ND being imaged? While the rep. rate can be used to explain some of
this, there is still a big enhancement and no sign of saturation. Why would there be no NV0
emission on the 1pE, but it becomes apparent in 2PE? Are the authors sure the 2PE signal is
indeed NV or could there be something else here?
5. Figure 7 – perhaps it is also useful here to provide count rates. How does this correspond to the
estimated Strehl given the wavefront error? Page 10, line 45, is the sigma measured?
6. I found the FRC discussion very interesting. However, I am unsure how reliable the FRC might
be as a characterisation tool? The authors state that the FRC may be used to better characterise the
effective resolution. For Strehl ratio of 0.3, the result is given as 49 nm, but in Fig 7d, it seems we
are no longer able to resolve the pair of NDs at the top of the image? The FRC for Strehl of 0.1 is
184nm, still very respectable in terms of resolution, but the SRRF image appears as noise with
many artefacts, and I am not sure it really offers any improvement over the raw image?

Introduction
The biocompatibility of diamond [1], combined with the ability to make nanoscopic particles of
<100 nm diameter, has led to research into the use of nanodiamond (ND) for a variety of biological
applications [2], including drug delivery [3,4] and use as a fluorescent marker for microscopy
[5,6]. The surface chemistry of ND allows it to be functionalised by chemically attaching a range
of different molecules to the ND surface [7,8]. Examples of functionalisation strategies include
antibody [9,10] and DNA [11] binding. The benefits arise by allowing efficient targetting of ND to
..............................................................
subcellular features of interest, thereby allowing effective labelling for fluorescent microscopy [2].
The fluorescence of ND is due to defects in the diamond structure [12]. A large number of
defects are known to show fluorescent properties [8], but of particular interest is the nitrogen-
vacancy (NV) defect, which occurs when two neighbouring carbon atoms are replaced by a
nitrogen atom and a vacant space in the crystal lattice. This defect is most commonly found in
a negatively charged state, referred to as NV-, and is efficiently imaged with a single photon
excitation of 532 nm that results in emission over a wide wavelength band from 637 nm to
approximately 800 nm. A particular advantage of NV- emission is that, unlike most conventional
fluorophores used for microscopy, it is completely photostable, allowing imaging of individual
cells labelled with ND over periods of a week or more [13]. The brightness of an individual ND is a
function of the number of defects it contains. This number can be increased during the production
of nanodiamond, allowing for even brighter labelling, and is typically correlated with the size of
the ND: particles smaller than 5 - 10 nm are unlikely to be able to support a fluorescently active
NV [14,15] without specific processing [16]. By contrast, 100 nm particles may have hundreds
of active NV centres. This flexbility allows a tradeoff between the intrinsic brightness of the
ND (improving signal to noise for a given image acquisition rate) and the potential impact of
the ND on the local biological processes (due either to physical blocking or surface chemistry
effects). There have been many studies demonstrating the use of ND with standard microscopy
techniques, including confocal microscopy [17] and super-resolution imaging in the form of
stimulated emission depletion microscopy [18,19].
An additional driver for the interest in NV as a fluorophore relates to the quantum mechanical
properties that can be accessed optically [20]. By combining optical excitation and readout (as is
performed when imaging in a microscope) with some pulsed microwave (˜2.88 GHz) electronic-
spin manipulation, it is possible to use the NV- centre as a sensor that can detect a number of
features of the local environment, such as the temperature [6,21] and the presence of magnetic
fields [22–25]. Active sensing of environmental changes induced by biological processes at a
sub-micron scale, with NV centres, would extend the usefulness of ND in a range of imaging
applications. However, while the emission of NV- is in a wavelength range with low scattering
and absorption by water, the single photon excitation wavelength of 532 nm poses problems
related both to scattering and autofluorescence effects that will decrease the effective sensitivity
of the ND to the signals of interest.
One alternative approach is to take advantage of two-photon excitation (TPE) microscopy,
which has the ability to image at a greater depth than single photon microscopy [26] due to
decreased scattering and absorption. There is also a better signal to noise ratio as the fluorescence
is only generated at the excitation focus and not throughout the whole illumination cone, giving
significant benefits in autofluorescent samples. It has recently been shown that NV centres in
bulk diamond samples can fluoresce with TPE [27] and likewise for NV in fragments of diamond
of sizes 10 - 100 µm [28]. Tuning the excitation wavelengths in a range from 1030 to 1310 nm
allows preferential excitation of NV- or the neutral NV0 state. There have been initial reports of
TPE fluoresence in nanodiamonds [29–31], showing that they are compatible with this mode of
imaging.
In this paper we further demonstrate TPE imaging of NV centres in ND and show how ND 3
is particularly suited to computational super-resolution techniques, such as that enabled by the
super-resolution radial fluctuations (SRRF) [32] approach.To allow high quality super-resolution
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
imaging, we take advantage of the adaptive optics technology incorporated in our microscope.
By using deformable mirrors, which can introduce controllable distortions to the wavefront of
the light that propagates through the microscope, it is possible to compensate for the optical
aberrations introduced by the inhomogenous nature of the samples we wish to image. For further
understanding of the requirements for implementation of adaptive optics within microscopy,
we recommend Refs. [33,34]. While multi-photon microscopy is inherently suited to imaging
in optically aberrating samples, it nevertheless benefits from adaptive optical image correction
[35–37]. With this in mind, we also demonstrate adaptive optic control of the excitation focal
..............................................................
volume and the resulting changes in the images obtained from single ND crystals. By combining
adaptive-optics and computational super-resolution imaging, we also show that ND is a superb
fluorophore with significant potential for applications in which efficient correction of aberrations
deep within an aberrating medium (such as tissue) is essential.
Experimental
Materials and sample preparation
The nanodiamonds used in these experiments were produced by Adamas Nanotechnologies. We
prepared slides for imaging from a mix of two monodisperse suspensions (both 0.1%w/v) of
40 nm and 100 nm diameter ND. The 40 nm ND each contain approximately 10 NV while there
are closer to 400 NV per 100 nm ND as per the manufacturers calibration information. To prepare
a suspension suitable for deposition on a coverslip we first sonicated each source of NDs to break
up larger aggregates before adding 10 µl of each ND suspension to 100 µl of distilled water. The
resulting suspension was then deposited onto a #1.5 microscope glass cover slip and allowed to
dry to ensure some ND adhered to the coverslip before being mounted on to a microscope slide
using a small amount of distilled water as a mountant medium and finally sealing the sample
with nail polish.
Microscope and imaging equipment
The microscope that provided all of the imaging for this work is a custom-designed, confocal
microscope. A 1.35NA oil immersion objective lens was used for imaging in an epi-flourescence
geometry. We used two excitation lasers for the work presented in this paper:
• A <50 ps pulse-duration 532 nm Picoquant laser running at a repetition rate of 40 MHz.
This laser was used for single photon excitation of NV- centres.
• A Coherent Fidelity 2 pulsed fibre laser with a wavelength centred on 1070 nm, a
bandwidth of 70 nm and a pulse duration of 40 fs at the laser’s output. A chirp
compensator allows optimisation of the pulse duration at the sample by maximising the
observed multi-photon signal.
The fluorescent light emitted from the sample was coupled via an optical fibre (acting as the
confocal pin hole for the single photon excitation) to a single pixel detector, a Laser Components
avalanche photodiode (Count-50).The final lens before the optical fibre was chosen to set an
effective pinhole size of 1 Airy unit. This may give a slight increase in contrast in two-photon
imaging mode, however the effect of the pinhole will be dominated by the inherent optical
sectioning provided by the TPE process. Images were created by raster scanning the beam across
the sample using a Newport Fast Steering Mirror (FSM-300) and axial-imaging was performed
by moving the objective which was mounted on a Physik Instrumente piezo positioner (P-725
PIFOC). We have chosen the detection path to have a wavelength sensitivity of 650-750 nm.
This range corresponds with the peak of the emission from NV- centres. As will be discussed 4
further in section 4, a Boston Micromachines Corporation deformable mirror (Multi-DM) with
140 actuators and 3.5µm stroke is used for aberration correction of both the excitation and signal
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
paths. Control of the microscope was performed by custom-written Labview software driving a
National Instruments FPGA.
Two Photon Imaging
We begin by demonstrating the effectiveness of two-photon imaging with our system. Figure
1 shows a comparison of one-photon and two-photon imaging on our mixed ND sample. We
processed the data initially in Fiji [38,39] and then generated the output figures for publication
..............................................................
in OriginPro. We present the images using “CubeHelix” [40], a colourmap that increases linearly

Figure 1 shows the comparison between single-photon and multi-photon imaging of a single
region of our sample. Sub-figures 1 a) and c) show that there is excellent correlation between
the ND’s that appear when imaging with 532 nm excitation and those present with 1070 nm
excitation, respectively. To show the comparable resolution in both cases, Figs. 1 b) and d) show a
higher resolution scan of the same pair of ND within the larger scan.
An advantage of multi-photon excitation is that it provides intrinsic sectioning when imaging,
due to the excitation only occuring in the central volume of the excitation point-spread function
(PSF). We include a video, (Supplemental Material 1), which shows multiple ND at different z-
positions within the sample when imaged with the 1070 nm excitation.
While Fig. 1 demonstrates that we are seeing multi-photon excitation of the NV within our
ND, we also wanted to confirm that it is a two-photon process. To confirm this, the beam was
centred on a single ND and the detected photon counts were measured versus excitation power
for both single- and multi-photon excitation modes. The results are shown in figure 2 for the
532 nm excitation and in figure 3 for the 1070 nm excitation. In the 532 nm excitation case, and
at low input powers, the number of counts increases linearly with the power of the excitation
laser. This is as expected for single photon fluorescence. For all fluorophores, as the excitation
power increases further, the emitted fluorescence increases sub-linearly and starts to plateau -
it saturates [41]. Figure 2 shows exactly this behaviour in the single-photon excitation of ND,
with saturation already apparent at 100 µW incident power and an estimated peak count rate of
approximately 80,000 s-1 . The inset of Fig. 2, plotting count rate and power on logarithmic scales,
shows a power law fit with power parameter n = 0.8 at low excitation power. That the value of n is
less than one likely reflects the fact that we included points where saturation is already beginning
to occur. It is worth noting here that it is often undesirable to image fluorophores in the saturation
regime as it increases the probability of a photo-bleaching event due to inter-system crossings
when the fluorophore is in the excited state. However, the photostability of NV centres means
that it is possible to image them indefinitely even when well into the saturation regime. This is
particularly relevant when seeking to use the emission properties of the NV as an environmental
sensor. Knowing the relationship between excitation power and degree of saturation is useful
as it allows us to maximise the photons being detected while decreasing the possibility of other
phototoxicity effects from the excitation laser.
In the case of the 1070 nm excitation, Fig. 3, we see a super-linear dependence of the emission
on the excitation power. For a pure two photon process the count rate should be quadratic with the
excitation intensity. Performing a power law fit we recover a power parameter of n = 1.84 ± 0.02
indicating that we are seeing TPE as the mechanism for generating fluorescence at this excitation
wavelength. There are two phenomena here that are worth commenting on. Firstly, we do not see
saturation in the TPE power dependence. As discussed in the description of the microscope, we
are limited to 12 mW power at the sample for the 1070 nm excitation laser, so this is likely a result

of insufficient available laser power. The second point of note is that the TPE appears to show
higher fluorescence counts than the single-photon excitation at saturation. We do not currently
have a full explanation for this. One contribution to the observed count rates comes from the
fact that the 1070 nm laser was operated at a higher pulse repetition rate than the 532 nm laser
(70 MHz vs 40 MHz). For short-duration laser pulses (tP ulse < tN V - ) this is equivalent to stating
that each pulse results in one photon being emitted. Therefore, for repetition rates < 1/tN V - , as
is the case here, we would expect the count rate to be proportional to the laser repetition rate.
Reference [28] also shows that, even with the 650 nm long pass filter in our system, there can still
be significant NV0 emission leaking into the NV- channel. Furthermore, with 1070 nm excitation
there is a significant cross-section for NV0 excitation. We did not have appropriate spectroscopic
equipment to unambiguously determine the contribution of the NV0 to this excess count rate.
However, we note that this would mainly be an issue for the use of the NV- spin properties in

local field sensing. For general two-photon imaging, the apparent brightness of the ND with the
excitation wavelength and power demonstrated here is beneficial. Should the application require
efficient NV- only excitation, then reference [28] suggests longer wavelength excitation (>1150 nm)
will improve the emission from NV-.
Adaptive Optics
Typical implementations of adaptive optics in two-photon microscopy [35] use active elements
in the excitation path only and, due to the signal being generated only at the focal volume,
employ wavefront sensors to directly detect the aberrations. As we are using a confocal detection
scheme, the microscope used for these measurements has a deformable mirror (DM) installed
in the common beam path and in such a way that it is imaged onto the back aperture of the
objective. Deformations of the mirror can therefore be used to implement adaptive optical control
of the PSF, with particular emphasis on correcting aberrations induced by the sample and which
degrade image quality. Orthogonal control modes for the DM are derived from the individual
actuator influence functions as described in references [42,43] and we use a sensorless correction
procedure [36,44] in which image-based metrics are used to measure the optimal shape of the DM.
A driver for the development of efficient AO correction schemes has been the desire to minimise
the photons lost to the correction process; if the sample undergoes significant photobleaching
during the aberration estimation then it may call into question the use of AO in that particular
sample. The lack of photobleaching of the NV centre therefore makes it an ideal candidate for
implementing and testing aberration correction techniques.

In figure 4 we demonstrate control over the PSF of our two-photon confocal imaging system.
All sub-figures are of the same ND, differing in the abberation applied to the DM and with a
colour scale normalised to the maximum pixel value shown in the sub figure. Since aberrations
are expected to decrease the peak intensity of the PSF, we also show this peak value as referenced
to the peak intensity of the unaberrated PSF, Fig. 4 a). For this demonstration we have applied
modes corresponding to the two primary astigmatism aberrations (Zernike modes 5 and 6, using
Noll indices) . Fig. 4 b) shows vertical astigmatism, while Fig. 4 c) and d) show positive and
negative amounts of oblique astigmatism. The fidelity with the expected PSF shape is good, with
little cross-talk between modes. The combination of two photon excitation microscopy, ND as a
fluorophore and adaptive optics will allow deeper imaging in tissue than possible with either
technique alone and we look forward to further exploring the possibilities in future work.
Superresolution imaging of two photon excitation microscopy
The photostability of the NV defect makes it particularly suited to computational super-resolution
techniques such as Super-Resolution Radial Fluctuations (SRRF) imaging. The algorithm and
theory underlying the method is described in Reference [32], and a plug-in module for ImageJ
makes it a particularly user-friendly technique. SRRF makes use of the radial symmetry of the
PSF to generate a radiality map that locates the fluorophore within the image. By then taking
advantage of correlations in naturally occurring fluctuations in the radial symmetry measured
over a large number images of the same object, the SRRF algorithm can extract super-resolution
images. In practice, a minimum of 100 standard resolution images are synthesised into a single

SRRF image. It is worth noting that current versions of the SRRF algorithm do not offer any
resolution enhancement along the optical axis.
Figure 5 a) shows a pair of ND clusters imaged using two photon excitation microscopy.
This image was generated by repeating 100 times and processed by correcting for in-plane
sample drift, using the NanoJ-Core algorithm [45], followed by summing the 100 frames. With
a 1.5 ms pixel dwell time, and an image size of 101x101 pixels, each frame takes approximately
18 s to complete (including line flyback time), with the full image stack therefore taking
approximately 30 minutes. To generate the SRRF image shown in Fig. 5 b) we again applied the
drift-correction routine before using the NanoJ-SRRF plugin with settings: Ring Radius = 0.5,
Radiality Magnification = 6, Axes in Ring = 7 and Temporal Radiality Average. The resultant
image shows significant increase in resolution, however there are some artefacts present; along
with the lines joining individual NDs, inspection of the raw data shows predominant sample
drift along the Z axis and the presence of two distinct layers of ND separated in the Z-axis. From

the drift correction table generated by NanoJ, which corrects only for lateral drift, we see this
corroborated with a maximum lateral drift of 45 nm. Supplemental Movie 1 shows the results of
a 3D stack of this cluster.
To better demonstrate the quality of SRRF imaging possible with ND, we performed further
measurements on the upper cluster of nanodiamond imaged in Fig. 5. By keeping the pixel size
approximately the same (70 nm versus 80 nm in Fig. 5) but decreasing the image boundaries, we
hoped that the resulting shorter scan times would decrease the sample drift along the optical
axis. Drift in this axis cannot be efficiently corrected on our hardware and has a significant
deleterious effect on the SRRF processing algorithm. The results of these measurements are shown
in Figure 6, with the 100 drift-corrected and summed standard resolution TPE frames shown in
Fig. 6 a) and the SRRF processed image in Fig. 6 b). In this case the frame time is about 5 s and
while the maximal lateral drift as determined by the drift correction routine is now 63 nm, there
is much less Z-axis drift apparent in the raw data. As is the case with the larger clusters in
Fig. 5, the SRRF algorithm is able to recover significant extra resolution, and the higher quality
initial imaging translates into higher SRRF resolutions. We will return to this point below. To
show the enhancement in resolution, Fig. 6 b) includes insets that enlarge two 250 nm square
regions of interest. In the lower region we show that there is structure now visible within the
brightest diffraction-limited spot within the TPE image of Fig. 6 a). The lateral extent of this
emitting region is of the order of 100 nm, however we do not have sufficient information to
know unambiguously whether we are observing structured emission from a single 100 nm ND
or emission from a small cluster of 40 nm ND. The upper region highlighted on Fig. 6 b) appears
to be clearer in interpretation; there are two closely spaced emitters that the SRRF map shows as
being distinguishable. To gain an initial estimation of the resolution of the SRRF image, we show
a vertical slice through the left emitter of the pair along the green dashed line. Fitting this intensity
profile to a Gaussian gives a 44 nm full-width-half-maximum (FWHM), consistent with this being
a single 40 nm ND.
We have shown that sample drift can adversely affect the quality of a SRRF reconstruction.
An advantage of our microscope, when combined with the lack of photobleaching of the ND, is
that we can also explore the effects of optical aberrations on the SRRF process. Figure 7 shows
a demonstration of how this can be put into practice. As a reference, the upper row of Fig. 7
(a) and b)) shows the unaberrated TPE and SRRF images. We then acquired further TPE image

sets with identical imaging conditions apart from a known aberration being applied to the DM.
For the middle row (Fig. 7 c) and d)) we applied 1 unit each of astigmatism and coma (Zernike
Noll indices 6 and 7). To further quantify the effect of the aberration, we consider the effective
RMS wavefront error, s, being applied by the DM. In this case s = 1.10 rad. From this, we
2
can also estimate the Strehl ratio as S = e-s . The Strehl ratio gives an indication of image
quality, with S = 1 representing perfect (unaberrated) imaging conditions and decreasing values
of S corresponding to increasing image degradation due to aberrations. For general imaging
S < 0.8 is considered to represent poor imaging conditions. For s = 1.10 rad, this results in a
Strehl ratio of 0.30. This is comparable to the Strehl ratio previously observed [46] when imaging
at a depth of 10 µm in cleared Drosophila melanogaster brain tissue. The resulting SRRF images
show more noise, no clear structure in the features highlighted in Fig. 6 b) and artefacts that
appear to link previously distinct features. To demonstrate the effects of even higher aberrations,
s = 1.43, S = 0.12, we applied 3 units each of coma and astigmatism, with the results being shown
in Fig. 7 e) and f). While SRRF still recovers some features with this level of aberration, the image
is significantly degraded when compared to either of the other two aberration cases. It is worth
noting that the Strehl ratio can also be calculated as the ratio of the peak aberrated intensity to
the peak unaberrated intensity. From the peak intensities in Fig. 7a,c,e), and assuming that a) is
a reasonable approximation of the no-aberration case, we find that the measured low aberration
Strehl ratio is 0.54, while the high aberration is 0.13. We attribute the difference between the
expected Strehl ratios and the empirical ones to be due to drift in the calibration of the deformable
mirror. While Fig. 4 shows that the applied modes behave according to their expected aberration
class, we did not obtain sufficient quantitative information to confirm the modal amplitude
calibration of the DM. Once more, we would like to emhasise that the photostability of the ND
emission allows us to obtain high quality and trustworthy data, such as that being discussed
in this paragraph, that is invaluable in the alignment and characterisation of complex optical
microscopy experiments.
To better quantify the effective resolution of the SRRF images in all three cases shown in
Fig. 7, we applied the Fourier Ring Correlation technique (FRC) [47]. This works on a pair of

images that differ only in noise: at low spatial frequencies which are dominated by the (identical) 12
structure of the sample there is a high degree, F RC ˜ 1, of correlation, which decreases with
increasing spatial frequency until reaching a point at which the images are dominated entirely by
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
uncorrelated noise. The spatial frequency at which this crossover occurs, often referred to as the
FRC resolution, is a measure of the maximum spatial frequency (minimum feature size) that still
contains information in the images. Figure 8 shows the FRC curves derived from each aberration
case, with the FRC value plotted against inverse pixels as the unit of spatial frequency. To generate
the FRC curve, we performed drift correction on the original TPE image sequences, deinterleaved
the resulting odd and even frames and processed them in the SRRF algorithm. The resulting pair
of SRRF images was then used for the FRC algorithm. Our chosen SRRF parameters resulted in a
pixel size of 11.4 nm, which can be used to convert from spatial frequency to resolution.

FRC resolutions given in the text refer to when each curve first crosses the threshold.
Also shown on Fig. 8 is the threshold curve used to determine the FRC resolution. Common
approaches to determine the FRC resolution use a fixed value of 1/7 as the threshold for the
FRC resolution: the spatial frequency at which the FRC curve first falls under 1/7 is given as the
resolution. A problem with this is, for low spatial frequencies, the FRC curve is derived from
Fourier-domain rings that contain fewer pixels than those for higher spatial frequencies. There
is therefore a difference in the statistical behaviour in these two conditions [48,49] for which a
better threshold is the curve defining the FRC level at which each pixel contains half of one bit of
information. We include this "Half-bit Threshold" on Fig. 8 and use it to determine the resolution
for each of our images. The resulting resolutions are given in Table 1

That the FRC resolution agrees with the FWHM of the Gaussian fit in Fig. 6 b) is gratifying.
We note that the FRC measures self-similarity of images, and does so in a manner that averages
across the entire image. As such, the number obtained from the FRC curve, and which is generally
..............................................................
considered to be equivalent to the resolution, does not necessarily hold across the entire image.
Indeed, despite the FRC resolution of 49 nm, the upper central pair of ND in Fig. 7 d) are not
resolved. We therefore emphasise again that the FRC is a useful tool, but that there is still
a widely acknowledged, and unsolved, problem of the definition of image resolution in super-
resolution microscopy. What is nevertheless surprising is the robustness of the SRRF algorithm
to aberrations - we see evidence of resolution enhancement even in the case of strongly aberrated
images, although it is doubtful how much information can usefully be extracted from the SRRF
image in the high aberration case.
Nanodiamond photostability
To further demonstrate the exceptional photostability of ND, we prepared a sample of 70 nm
ND (Sigma Aldrich) on a #1.5 coverslip using immersion oil as the mounting medium. Under
532 nm excitation we were able to image a single ND over multiple hours without any loss of
signal. Figure 9 shows an example of this photostability; there is little change in the fluorescence
detected over a period of 100 s of continuous excitation of a single ND using 1 mW of average
power at 532 nm. Each data point was taken sequentially with a 2 ms integration time: this
plot shows 5 × 104 fluorescence measurements. The small loss of signal by the end of the run is
entirely due to sample drift and can be fully recovered by realigning the excitation laser to the ND
location. Under TPE conditions we observed directly equivalent stability. By way of comparison
with conventional fluorphores, with our microscope we typically observe a permanent decrease
in fluorescence of 50% in samples labelled with Alexa 488 after 100 frames of 1.5 ms pixel
duration and 100 µW of excitation power. With twice-Nyquist sampling conditions, this implies
an effective photobleaching half-life of 2.4 s. Thus, after an equivalent 100 s duration experiment
to that shown in Fig. 9, the Alexa 488 would be emitting at an intensity 3 × 10-13 of which it
began.
Conclusion
Nanodiamond has been shown to have much promise as a fluorophore for use in biological
imaging. With this study we have shown that it is not only an exceptional fluorophore in
single photon imaging, but that it is also superb when used with two-photon excitation
microscopes. Furthermore, we demonstate that its photostability gives it significant advantages
when performing adaptive-optics or computational super-resolution images. Indeed, we saw
evidence for a ten-fold resolution increase when generating SRRF images from our two-photon
data.
