The mechanism of telomere length regulation in human cells is still poorly understood. While
several protein factor have been shown to contribute to this process, the extent by which telomere
length is regulated specifically at individual telomeres, while documented, remains unclear, both
in terms of its determinants and its general conservation across evolution.
In this report the authors aim to address the latter question, using two previously published
datasets containing telomere length form a range of mammals. Based on previous data in the
literature, the working hypothesis is put forward that average chromosome size positively
correlates with telomere length size. If I understand correctly, the data analysis rests entirely on
average chromosome sizes estimated form C-value content, rather than sequenced genome sizes.
Certainly, for several of the species studied here there must genome sequence data available, and
it would be interesting to use these to asses the reliability of the C-value estimates. More
importantly, I think that the study is severely limited by having to rely on average, inferred,
chromosome size, rather than on precise and specific data on individual chromosomes. For
example, given the reported effect of arm length on telomere length, one would expect the latter
to be affected not just by overall chromosome size but also by chromosome structure, with
acrocentric chromosomes being differently affected at telomeres compared to metacentric ones of
similar size. Given these considerations, and the low level of statistical confidence in their
conclusions (which the authors themselves acknowledge), I think that the study is of limited
general interest. The strongest message of the study is that better datasets are needed to address
the role of chromosome size in affecting telomere length.

This manuscript by Klegarth and Eisenberg is a very useful addition to a somewhat neglected
area of telomere biology: influence of whole chromosome length or chromosome arm length on
3
setting telomere length. The study is designed and conducted in a careful manner, statistical
analysis is sound and data interpretation is logical and supported by the good grasp of telomere
biology and phylogenetics. In my opinion this study is the most comprehensive so far in its
phylogenetic coverage of mammalian telomere biology.
However, there are several details that should be improved in the text of the manuscript so that
readers get a more rounded picture of the relationship between telomere length, chromosome
size and karyotype evolution.
I have listed some concerns below that the authors should consider when revising the
manuscript:
1. The key question is this: what is the telomere? In line with the large majority of published
studies the authors have taken the genomic view i.e. that telomere is a DNA sequence with
identity by virtue of its universal presence at chromosomal ends. However, the alternative view
is that the telomere is a functional element required for effective chromosome segregation. There
is strong evidence that the sequence identity of the functional element is conserved (all
vertebrates share the same sequence). However, there is also evidence that the sequence is not
important for the function in species with non-canonical telomeres (e.g. drosophila). Therefore,
there is a need to precisely define the functional part of the telomere in the context of the current
study. Given that the study focused only on mammals the authors must have confidence that
their data are derived from studies which identify functional parts of telomeres as part of
telomere length measurement procedures. Unfortunately, the methodology in studies used by the
authors as the source for data analysis are somewhat problematic because the TRF method for
measuring telomere length may include degenerate telomeric sequences (probably subtelomeric)
which are not required fro telomere function (telomeric proteins bind exclusively to telomeric
sequence). Therefore, the authors should indicate more explicitly this possibility as a limitation of
their analysis.
2. Recent studies suggest that telomere length measurement in human cells by methods such as
Southern blot (TRF analysis) or qPCR have some limitations in a sense that they detect interstitial
telomeric sequences leading to a somewhat false picture. Interstitial telomeric sequences may be
widespread throughout the human genome. They not part of telomeres as functional elements.
The presence of these sequences complicates the relationship between chromosome length and
telomeres as functional elements of chromosomes.
3. The authors must also explicitly state that their analytical approach has limits from the
perspective of cell biology. For example, to test the relationship between telomere length and
chromosome size the authors calculated average size of the chromosome for each genome.
However, there is no genome in nature in which chromosomes are equal in length.
4. Authors also neglect the role of telomeres and chromosome size in the organisation of the
nucleus. It is well known that chromosomes are not randomly arranged in the nucleus
(chromosome territories). Certain chromosomes in the human genome tend to locate in the
interior of the nucleus whereas their counterparts of similar size locate at the periphery. It is
likely that telomeres play a role in the interphase nuclei organisation. Randomising the size of
chromosomes as the authors did in their analysis ignores the non-randomness of chromosome
organisation in the nucleus and the role of telomeres in this process.
5. One would hope that with more sequenced genomes the relationship between telomere size
and chromosome size will be clarified with time. Unfortunately, sequencing technologies in their
present stage of development cannot fully cover telomeres and centromeres. The result is that
measuring telomere length precisely remains a problem. Each technique has limitations. Perhaps
a single technique which provides the most reliable results is qFISH.
Overall, the study is scientifically sound, the manuscript is well written but I suggest that the
authors state limitations of their analytical approach more explicitly in the revised manuscript.

Comments to the Author:
Dear Dr. Klegarth,
Thank you for your submission to the Royal Society's Open Science.
I apologize for the substantial time it has taken to have your manuscript assessed due to the
availability of reviewers. As you will see, two expert reviewers have assessed your work and
while both find the topic highly suitable and important, both make substantial comments about
critical parameters in estimating chromosome size using the C-value rather than actual genome

size, the relationship between chromosomal arm length and telomere length (reviewer 1) as well
as the measurement of the telomere itself (reviewer 2).
Having considered these comments as well as that several statistical analyses revealed weak
associations, I am afraid that we cannot accept the manuscript.
If you can address the substantial issues raised by the reviewers then we would be pleased to
look at the research again. This would be as a new submission since the points raised are so
substantial.
I am sorry this will come as a disappointment but hope you will consider Open Science in the
future.
Yours sincerely,

Author response to reviewers:
We would like to thank both reviewers for their thoughtful evaluation of our manuscript. We
gree with a great many of their critiques and have edited our manuscript to reflect, in particular,
reas where caveats needed additional highlighting. We also list our responses in bolded text
elow the individual critiques here. Lines of text amended to address reviewer concerns are

) If I understand correctly, the data analysis rests entirely on average chromosome sizes
stimated form C-value content, rather than sequenced genome sizes. Certainly, for several of
he species studied here there must genome sequence data available, and it would be interesting
o use these to assess the reliability of the C-value estimates.
We agree that the usage of C-value estimates should be more clearly discussed. Past
esearch has found a tight correlation (r = 0.95) between C-value measured via traditional
ytogenetic methods and those measured via sequencing and assembly (Elliott and Gregory
015). Elliott and Gregory (2015) also found a systematic underestimation of genome size
ia sequencing as genomes increased in size. This is likely due to the inability of
ioinformatic pipelines to distinguish stop and start points of repetitive, non-coding

onic regions of the genome. Larger genomes can be expected to have larger spans of
-coding DNA.
ditionally, relying on sequenced genomes would reduce an already limited sample size
mmals with consistent, available telomere length measurements). The best compilation
ssembled mammalian sequenced genomes (Kapusta et al. 2017) would limit the study to
n of 10. Given the tight correlation found between cytogenetic and sequencing based
asures of genome size and the increasing disparity between the measures based on
rall genome size, we find it most appropriate to utilize C-values derived from traditional
ogenetic methods and compiled within the animal genome size database (Gregory 2016)
riginally used within the manuscript.
have added a passage to the manuscript explaining these points on lines 68-72 which
ds:
These C-values estimated via traditional cytogenetic methods strongly correlate to
genome sizes measured via sequencing and assembly (34). Due to the systemic
underestimation of larger genomes when measured via sequencing (34) as well as the
limited number of available sequenced mammalian genomes with corresponding TL
measures, C-values were deemed the most appropriate metric for estimating mean
chromosome size.
More importantly, I think that the study is severely limited by having to rely on average,
rred, chromosome size, rather than on precise and specific data on individual
omosomes. For example, given the reported effect of arm length on telomere length, one
ld expect the latter to be affected not just by overall chromosome size but also by
omosome structure, with acrocentric chromosomes being differently affected at telomeres
pared to metacentric ones of similar size.
agree wholeheartedly with this point. Indeed, we spent considerable time and effort
king for such data to add to this manuscript. However, with chromosome-specific
mere length being largely unavailable for most mammalian species, this is an
voidable limitation. We believe this was succinctly acknowledged in the original
nuscript upfront in lines 6-10. We also addressed this limitation while discussing recent
ion, fusion events in what are now lines 189-192 of the discussion. We now include
her discussion of these issues in lines 201-209 to address this issue as noted below:
In addition to the proposed evolutionary mechanisms that may obscure the relationship
between chromosome size and TL, we must also note some additional methodological
limitations. The limited data available on TL for specific chromosomes and chromosome
arms across mammalian taxa may mask a stronger relationship between chromosome
size and TL. Moreover, the largest datasets on TL in mammals (30, 31) both utilized TRF,
a method which cannot perfectly disentangle terminal TL (or functional telomeres) from
degenerate or interstitial telomeric sequences. Future multi-species studies should
consider employing more precise methodologies such as Q-FISH paired with confocal
microscopy (51) to better characterize chromosome arm specific TLs.
iven these considerations, and the low level of statistical confidence in their conclusions
ich the authors themselves acknowledge), I think that the study is of limited general interest.
strongest message of the study is that better datasets are needed to address the role of
omosome size in affecting telomere length.
ile we agree that the narrative of this paper would be more compelling if our hypothesis
firmly supported by our results, we believe it is important for papers to be judged not
heir results, but on their hypotheses and experimental design. Telomere biology is of
ad interest, but a prominent aspect of telomere length variation that we explore in this
er is little understood. We agree with the reviewer in the hope that this paper helps to
ire further explorations of the strong association between chromosome size and TL

s manuscript by Klegarth and Eisenberg is a very useful addition to a somewhat neglected
of telomere biology: influence of whole chromosome length or chromosome arm length on
ing telomere length. The study is designed and conducted in a careful manner,
istical analysis is sound and data interpretation is logical and supported by the good grasp of
mere biology and phylogenetics. In my opinion this study is the most comprehensive so far in
hylogenetic coverage of mammalian telomere biology.
wever, there are several details that should be improved in the text of the manuscript so that
ers get a more rounded picture of the relationship between telomere length, chromosome size
karyotype evolution.
ve listed some concerns below that the authors should consider when revising the
uscript:
he key question is this: what is the telomere? In line with the large majority of published
ies the authors have taken the genomic view i.e. that telomere is a DNA sequence with
tity by virtue of its universal presence at chromosomal ends. However, the alternative view
at the telomere is a functional element required for effective chromosome segregation. There
rong evidence that the sequence identity of the functional element is conserved (all
ebrates share the same sequence). However, there is also evidence that the sequence is not
ortant for the function in species with non-canonical telomeres (e.g. drosophila). Therefore,
e is a need to precisely define the functional part of the telomere in the context of the current
y. Given that the study focused only on mammals the authors must have confidence that their
are derived from studies which identify functional parts of telomeres as part of telomere
th measurement procedures. Unfortunately, the methodology in studies used by the authors
he source for data analysis are somewhat problematic because the TRF method for measuring
mere length may include degenerate telomeric sequences (probably subtelomeric) which are
required for telomere function (telomeric proteins bind exclusively to telomeric sequence).
refore, the authors should indicate more explicitly this possibility as a limitation of their
lysis.
ecent studies suggest that telomere length measurement in human cells by methods such as
thern blot (TRF analysis) or qPCR have some limitations in a sense that they detect
rstitial telomeric sequences leading to a somewhat false picture. Interstitial telomeric
uences may be widespread throughout the human genome. They not part of telomeres as
ctional elements. The presence of these sequences complicates the relationship between
omosome length and telomeres as functional elements of chromosomes.
understand and appreciate the reviewers concerns regarding how TL is measured in
datasets we rely upon in this study. However, data using alternative measurement
niques is not available across a wide-enough range of mammalian taxa to incorporate
the study of this particular question. We have added this consideration to the
ussion in lines 201-206 as stated here:
In addition to the proposed evolutionary mechanisms that may obscure the relationship
between chromosome size and TL, we must also note some additional methodological
limitations. The limited data available on TL for specific chromosomes and chromosome
arms across mammalian taxa may mask a stronger relationship between chromosome
size and TL. Moreover, the largest datasets on TL in mammals (30, 31) both utilized TRF,
a method which cannot perfectly disentangle terminal TL (or functional telomeres) from
degenerate or interstitial telomeric sequences.
he authors must also explicitly state that their analytical approach has limits from the
pective of cell biology. For example, to test the relationship between telomere length and
omosome size the authors calculated average size of the chromosome for each genome.
wever, there is no genome in nature in which chromosomes are equal in length.
have amended our discussion to include an explicit statement of this limitation in lines
-204:
In addition to the proposed evolutionary mechanisms that may obscure the relationship
between chromosome size and TL, we must also note some additional methodological
limitations. The limited data available on TL for specific chromosomes and chromosome
arms across mammalian taxa may mask a stronger relationship between chromosome
size and TL.
omosome size and structure is largely available for a wide range of mammalian taxa,
ever, the corresponding TL at specific chromosomes (or chromosome arms) is not.
ce, there would be no way to incorporate that metric without the corresponding TL
a.
strongly suspect these limitations are contributing to a reduced r-value between
omosome size and TL and as TL and TL measurements are made at the level of the
ividual chromosome this relationship will be clarified.
uthors also neglect the role of telomeres and chromosome size in the organisation of the
leus. It is well known that chromosomes are not randomly arranged in the nucleus
omosome territories). Certain chromosomes in the human genome tend to locate in the
rior of the nucleus whereas their counterparts of similar size locate at the periphery. It is
ly that telomeres play a role in the interphase nuclei organisation. Randomising the size of
omosomes as the authors did in their analysis ignores the non-randomness of chromosome
anisation in the nucleus and the role of telomeres in this process.
agree that chromosome organization may contribute to the association between TL and
omosome size. However, since data about TL at specific chromosome ends and
rmation on chromosome arrangements within the nucleus are largely unavailable
oss species, we are unable to test these ideas in our manuscript. We now reference this
a in the discussion on lines 209-211 where we state:
Associations between chromosome specific TL and chromosome size may also be
impacted by telomere and chromosome positional effects within the nucleus (52).
ne would hope that with more sequenced genomes the relationship between telomere size
chromosome size will be clarified with time. Unfortunately, sequencing technologies in their
ent stage of development cannot fully cover telomeres and centromeres. The result is that
suring telomere length precisely remains a problem. Each technique has limitations. Perhaps
ngle technique which provides the most reliable results is qFISH.
agree that qFISH is an important method to be incorporated into future cross-species
lyses and we now further emphasize this point on lines 207-209:
Future multi-species studies should consider employing more precise methodologies such
as Q-FISH paired with confocal microscopy (51) to better characterize chromosome arm
specific TLs.
rall, the study is scientifically sound, the manuscript is well written but I suggest that the
ors state limitations of their analytical approach more explicitly in the revised manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
The overall message form the paper is that the dataset available in ordet to assess the proposed
hypothesis is limited. In this iregard it would be useful to see some comments about the quality
of the data as well. For example, is the overlap in the data indicative of reproducibility between
the two sets? Also, I was surprised, for example, that Mus spretus was not included in the
analysis as telomere length data on this rodent is surely available, and possibly more extensive
than for many of the species included here.
We agree that noting the concordance in telomere length measures between the two
datasets is a good idea and have added this analysis to Lines 65-67:

In the five species which overlapped between datasets a 1 kb longer TL in the Gomes et
al dataset predicted a 1.46 kb longer TL (95% CI: +0.72 to +2.21) in the Seluanov
dataset with a y-intercept of 4.41 (95% CI: -21.52 to +30.34).
also comment about data quality and comparability issues in multiple places in the
uscript:
es 78-84:
Telomere length data was measured via telomere restriction fragment (TRF) analysis for
both studies but with some variations in the TRF assay between the two studies (e.g.
different restriction enzymes). TL data were from cultured fibroblasts in Gomes et al.
(31), whereas data from Seluanov et al. (29) were from liver DNA. Due to these
differences in cell types and measurement technique between these two studies, we opted
to conduct our analysis separately in each TL dataset.
es 203-13:
In addition to the proposed evolutionary mechanisms that may obscure the relationship
between chromosome size and TL, we must also note some additional methodological
limitations. The limited data available on TL for specific chromosomes and chromosome
arms across mammalian taxa may mask a stronger relationship between chromosome
size and TL. Moreover, the largest datasets on TL in mammals (30, 31) both utilized TRF,
a method which cannot perfectly disentangle terminal TL (or functional telomeres) from
degenerate or interstitial telomeric sequences. Future multi-species studies should
consider employing more precise methodologies such as Q-FISH paired with confocal
microscopy (51) to better characterize chromosome arm specific TLs. Associations
between chromosome specific TL and chromosome size may also be impacted by
telomere and chromosome positional effects within the nucleus (52).
e 217-225:
Sample size limitations and disparities in TL measurements between studies and
quantification methods (53-54) underscores the need for more cross-species analyses to
occur within individual labs using well-calibrated and standardized methodologies for
TL quantification. Larger, well-calibrated, multi-species datasets will be necessary to
further explore these intrinsic properties of TL evolution to further inform basic TL
biology. Moreover, as molecular tools are continually refined, chromosome-specific
analyses will become available for a wider breadth of species and enable the
examination of these dynamics at much finer phylogenetic scales.
are aware that there are multiple mammalian species for which telomere lengths have been
sured, including in Mus spretus, that are not included in our analysis. Because of the
hodological concerns commented on above, we do not think it would be prudent to combine
e measures across different laboratories using different tissues, laboratory techniques and
analysis methods.
