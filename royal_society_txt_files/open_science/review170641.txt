This manuscript suggests a general framework to identify social avoidance in animal social networks. It is
based on an existing R package, and the authors suggest, in general, that building null spatial models can
account for the locations of individuals and help researchers determine if animals that were not seen
together, or seen only a few times, do so by chance or due to active avoidance of each other. Potentially,
this is an interesting and timely contribution, because most work in this field has focused on social
preference, usually ignoring the issue of avoidance. Nevertheless, I am not fully convinced that the current
work fully addresses this gap. Below I provide some general and more focused comments.
General:
One issue that is not addressed in the current framework is that home range does not only influence social
interactions, but may also be influenced by them. For example, if you analyze the spatial activity of a
married couple, you might find that their home ranges significantly overlap. However, this overlap is
actually a result of their decision to live together. Therefore, not every social association should be assessed
while controlling for spatial activity. It would be useful to address this complexity and suggest alternative
routes of analysis.
A more step-by-step description of the simulation model is required for readers to understand how it is
implemented. The current explanations of the simulation are rather cumbersome and hard to follow. A
diagram could be helpful.
Since VI is being used quite extensively, a more comprehensive explanation of its calculation and utility
would be helpful.
I could not find the data on Dryad
Detailed:
L 25-28: This sentence makes an unnecessary comparison between the two species, that I believe is not the
purpose of this study. No one would be surprised that different results come from these very different
species.
L 100: How is the distance threshold determined?
L 94: When describing the general framework, it is better to begin with a description of the framework
instead of referring to a package that would probably be unfamiliar to most readers. The technical details
of the implementation can come later.
L 121: The section about UD does not actually explain what is it and how it is used in this framework. The
minimum should be to cite a relevant paper.
L 154-155: The half-weight index (HWI) is suggested as a general applicable measure. However, this index
was developed to account for some biases in collecting data that can be study-specific. Why aren’t other
measures, such as the simple-ratio index, not applicable?
L171-173: Indeed it is a common and recommended practice to remove individuals that were not observed
enough times. Why, then, to remove them only at a later stage of the analysis? These individuals should be
removed beforehand.
L 244: The sentence mentions a number of sightings but the numbers look like area sizes - please clarify.
L 247-249: This sentence is a bit unclear. How was accuracy measured to determine the minimum number?
Table 1: This table needs reformatting to keep the rows intact. Currently it is very confusing.
Table 2: Row names could be helpful to understand this table.
Fig.1: The text is too small and almost unreadable. Also, it looks like dragons stabilize at 20, not 25.
3
Box 1: Why should random social avoidance be considered as avoidance? If individuals do not actively
avoid each other, I would say that avoidance is absent.
L 365: Did you mean Carter et al.?

The manuscript ‘A framework for the identification of long-term social avoidance in longitudinal datasets’
presents and tests a method for robustly characterising the social avoidance in studies of animal sociality.
The study is a useful contribution to an interesting and under-studied topic, it is generally well-written and
well-presented.
My background is in social structure and social preferences, and presumably someone with my
background is the intended audience of this study. Most of my comments are highlighting places where I
where I was unclear and required clarification- in the hope that this will help guide the authors when
redrafting the manuscript to make it clear to a general readership. My major and minor comments are
presented below.
Major comments
Defining avoidance: Given that the study address ‘social avoidance’ I feel it is imperative for the authors to
definitively and unambiguously define it. Social avoidance is defined piecemeal at various points through
the introduction, but mostly in terms of what it is not (lines 38-39), measurement (lines 47-57) or examples
(lines 63-67). I think a clear statement of definition would greatly increase the clarity of the manuscript. Of
particular importance is to differentiate between ‘social avoidance’ and simply lack of social preference-
which is not the same as the difference between avoidance and random association (lines 78+).
Alternative explanations: The authors do not discuss possible alternative, non-social, explanations for
individual’s appearing to avoid each other. In particular, individuals may have different resource
requirements based on, for example, age, sex, reproductive state or resource competition. This could result
in individuals foraging in different areas at different times, for example, for entirely non-social reasons.
Though clearly truly social avoidance is likely to occur (for the reasons outlined in lines 47-49) it is
important to be able to differ ate this from other alternative explanations. I feel it is worth the author’s
discuss this consideration in the manuscript.
4
Description of the method: In places I found the description of the methods was unclear and required prior
knowledge that might not be common to the general readership of Royal Society Open Science. Specific
example are pointed out in the minor comments below. But in particular I found the dirst paragraphs of
‘general framework’ unclear. I found myself reading the description of the Digiroo package to understand
what the null model is and how it is usually implemented. The authors highlight that the ‘null association
model has been previously described elsewhere’ (line 111), but I feel this is insufficient as the rest of the
manuscript discusses and tests the implementation of this null model, it is critical for readers to understand
exactly what is being discussed.
Minor comments
Line 99. Define home range
Line 100. Define utilisation distribution
Line 121-128. As above what is a utilisation distribution and how is it calculated?
Line 148. Degree is a dangerous word to use in the context of sociability as it is often usual as a measure of
centrality. (number of associates)
Line 156-165. I am unclear the justification for not simply using the same distance that individuals are
grouped together in the real data cannot also be used for the null distribution.
Line 178. I recommended the authors clearly define how the p value was calculated as per the
recommendation in this paper (Ruxton and Neuhäuser 2013).
Line 198-200. Could individuals observed in close association therefore not be acting aggressively- and
therefore individuals in close association (and therefore by these methods with a high social preference or
tolerance) not actually be acting aggressively.
Line 209- How accurate is this GPS? Given its importance in calculating UD and therefore the null
associations? Especially as for the dragons the smallest territory sizes are only 5m2.
Line 216- which species is being studied here, indo-pacific or common?
Line 307- 116 of how many?
Line 313- og how many?
Line 343-360. Not only p value but also some measure of effect size is usual in statistical analysis. Is there a
way to quantify the ‘strength’ of social avoidance?
Line 403. What is an ‘open social network’?
Figure 1. The y axis of these graphs is the only place HR is used as acronym for home range. Personally I
feel it isn’t very necessary to introduce an acronym here, but if if is used it should be defined in the legend.

Comments to the Author:
Dear Dr. Strickland,
I have now received comments from two expert reviewers. Both reviewers agreed that the intent of the
study to explore social avoidance was interesting and a valuable contribution to the literature. However
each raise several major concerns. The primary issues raised include: 1) there are alternative explanations
that you should consider (each reviewer mentioned different examples of this), 2) the presentation of your
methods and model were very difficult to follow and should be discussed more deliberately in a step-by-
step fashion to make it more accessible to a general audience. A refocusing of your paper will greatly
improve the readability and accessibility. At this time, unfortunately, my recommendation is to reject your
manuscript but allow for resubmission after you have considered and addressed these and the other
concerns that the reviewers raised.

I was happy to see this interesting manuscript again. The authors have responded positively to my
previous comments and I feel the manuscript is much improved. I found the new figure (figure 1)
particularly useful. My remaining comments are all minor.
Line 43-44. Slightly confusing, I initially read the ‘not’ as also applying to the ‘likely to leave groups’. I
suggest rewording for clarity.
Line 51-52. I think segregation due to differing resources requirements is also important to mention here.
Line 52. This paper (Carter et al. 2016) might provide a useful reference for avoidance by dominance
hierarchy.
Line 86. As the authors point out later Whitehead and James (ref 28) do include space, as the current
sentence is structured it implies that they do not.
Line 100 Acronym UD should be introduced here.
Line 129. Here ‘Utilisation’ is spelt with a z here, elsewhere with an s. (though I have not checked the full
document)
Line 176. ‘gprox’ is not defined in the manuscript.

Appendix A
Dear Editor,
Thank you very much for your helpful comments, and those of both reviewers. We have now
addressed all comments. Please find below the details of how each of the comments were
addressed and where in the revised manuscript such changes can be found.
Kind regards,
Kasha Strickland
___________________________________________________________________________
Editor’s comments:
Comment 1: there are alternative explanations that you should consider (each reviewer
mentioned different examples of this),
Response: This comment has been addressed. We have now incorporated within the
discussion of the revised ms the alternative explanations noted by both reviewers.
Please see revised ms lines 425 – 441:
“In agreement with Best et al. (1), we found that the most reliable way to optimise the null
model was to alter the grouping distance proxy used within the model to ensure the null
model matched the observed level of sociability. In both species, this resulted in a grouping
distance proxy larger than is used in the observed data. This indicates, as expected, that
individuals do not move randomly. For example, the distribution of resources influences how
individuals move within their home range. Similarly, an individual’s movement may also be
influenced by the distribution of conspecifics; in particular, individuals’ spatial distribution
may not only influence social interactions, but may also, in part, be determined by them.
Disentangling whether the formation of social relationships is caused by overlapping spatial
distributions, or overlapping distributions are caused by social relationships would be
extremely challenging. Some might argue that social relationships should therefore be
assessed without controlling for spatial activity (e.g. using the Manly-Bejder permutations
implemented in SOCPROG software (2, 3)). However, in dolphins, for instance, social
preferences have been shown to exist in spite of very little spatial overlap (4, 5). Moreover,
the confounded effects of spatial distribution and social relationships would not affect the
identification of
s given that these are identified as pairs of individuals which do not associate despite sharing
significant portions of their home range.”
And lines 464 – 471:
“The causality of the social avoidances identified here is likely diverse. For instance, it may
be that some avoidances are caused by the need to avoid conflict (e.g. avoidance of large of
aggressive individuals). Alternatively, some avoidances may be driven by groups of
individuals (e.g. ages of sexes) using space and/or resources at different times. Even so, the
study of avoidance has hitherto been unexplored, and in using this framework to identify
social avoidances, future research can focus on exploring the biology, and causality, of the
avoidances found here.”
Comment 2: the presentation of your methods and model were very difficult to follow and
should be discussed more deliberately in a step-by-step fashion to make it more accessible to
a general audience.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Following the advice of both reviewers,
we have re-written the explanation of the model at the beginning of the General
framework section so that it is presented in a more step-by-step fashion. We have also
included a diagram to help explain the step-by-step protocol (see figure 1).
Furthermore, we have clarified the methods at points as per either of the reviewers’
comments. Please see specific comments below.
Please see lines 98 – 119
“The null association model used here produces expected social associations between dyads
which result from random use of space use (Fig 1). The model does so by randomising
individuals’ spatial positions within their home ranges (the area in which individuals live),
using either home range contours or utilisation distributions. Random points are then
generated according to individuals UD (supplementary figure A1), as well as the probability
of being sighted, and random pairwise associations are extracted based on proximity between
random spatial positions (see figure 1 and section iv. for how to identify this threshold).
Spatial proximity between animals is a well-accepted method of estimating pairwise
associations in studies of social species where interactions are infrequent and/or difficult to
observe (6, 7). With both the observed and the randomly generated social groupings, the
strength of the pairwise associations can then be estimated and compared using an
appropriate association index (e.g. simple ratio index, twice-weight index, social affinity
index). Here, we used the half-weight index (HWI) because it is the most suitable index for
both systems (see 8). HWI is calculated using the following formula:
HWI = Nab/0.5(Na + Nb)
where Nab is the number of times individuals a and b were seen associated, and Na and Nb are
the number of times each individual was seen in total (8). Applying this model iteratively
allows us to generate a random probability distribution against which the observed value can
be statistically compared. In other words, a P value for each dyad is calculated as the
proportion of times the random association index was smaller (or greater for preferences)
than the observed. Avoidances can therefore be defined as instances where 95% (or more) of
random HWIs were greater than the observed HWI.”
Please also see figure 1.
Figure 1. Diagram describing the steps involved with the simulations. The example, based on
two individuals, illustrates the steps and the parameters that are important to consider. HWI
refers to association index half-weight index calculated as HWI = Nab/0.5(Na + Nb) where Nab
is the number of times individuals a and b were seen associated, and Na and Nb are the
number of times each individual was seen in total.
Reviewer: 1
R1, comment 1: One issue that is not addressed in the current framework is that home range
does not only influence social interactions, but may also be influenced by them. For example,
if you analyze the spatial activity of a married couple, you might find that their home ranges
significantly overlap. However, this overlap is actually a result of their decision to live
together. Therefore, not every social association should be assessed while controlling for
spatial activity. It would be useful to address this complexity and suggest alternative routes of
analysis.
Response: This comment has been addressed.
Please see revised ms lines 425 – 441:

R1, comment 2: A more step-by-step description of the simulation model is required for
readers to understand how it is implemented. The current explanations of the simulation are
rather cumbersome and hard to follow. A diagram could be helpful.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please refer to editor’s comment 2.
R1, comment 3: Since VI is being used quite extensively, a more comprehensive explanation
of its calculation and utility would be helpful.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 274 - 276:
“VI is a commonly used index of pairwise home range overlap. It measures the amount of
overlap between two UDs and calculates a value between 0 (no overlap) and 1 (complete
overlap).”
R1, comment 4: I could not find the data on Dryad
Response: This comment is addressed. Data should now be available at the following
doi:
doi:10.5061/dryad.71bm0
Detailed:
R1, comment 5: L 25-28: This sentence makes an unnecessary comparison between the two
species, that I believe is not the purpose of this study. No one would be surprised that
different results come from these very different species.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see line 26.
“Using this model allowed us to identify the presence of social avoidances in both species.”
R1, comment 6: L 100: How is the distance threshold determined?
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 104 and fig 1.
“random pairwise associations are extracted based on proximity between random spatial
positions (see figure 1 and section iv. for how to identify this threshold).”
R1, comment 7: L 94: When describing the general framework, it is better to begin with a
description of the framework instead of referring to a package that would probably be
unfamiliar to most readers. The technical details of the implementation can come later.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please refer to response to editor’s
comment 2.
R1, comment 8: L 121: The section about UD does not actually explain what is it and how it
is used in this framework. The minimum should be to cite a relevant paper.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 134 - 136
“UDs are home ranges that describe the frequency distribution of an individual’s location
data (37), estimating an individual’s probability of occurrence within an area across a grid of
the study sites coordinates.”
R1, comment 9: L 154-155: The half-weight index (HWI) is suggested as a general
applicable measure. However, this index was developed to account for some biases in
collecting data that can be study-specific. Why aren’t other measures, such as the simple-ratio
index, not applicable?
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 110 - 113
“strength of the pairwise associations can then be estimated and compared using an
appropriate association index for the study species (e.g. simple ratio index, twice-weight
index, social affinity index). Here, we used the half-weight index (HWI) because it is the
most suitable index for both systems”
R1, comment 10: L171-173: Indeed it is a common and recommended practice to remove
individuals that were not observed enough times. Why, then, to remove them only at a later
stage of the analysis? These individuals should be removed beforehand.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 187 – 199.
“When building the null model, we subset the data to include individuals with enough
sightings to accurately estimate their home range. However, in most cases, to obtain reliable
assignment of relationships (e.g. avoid – random – prefer), more sightings will be needed
than to gain accurate home range estimations. First, we subsetted the data to include only
individuals that had enough sightings to accurately estimate their UD (see section i.). Second,
for post-hoc analysis we selected only individuals which had the minimum number of
sightings required to classify pairwise relationships (e.g. avoidance – random/neutral –
preference) accurately. We selected individuals for identification of avoidance (and
preference) post-hoc because in the null model it is important to retain as many individuals as
possible in order to optimise the null accurately (i.e. to match observed sociability).
Nonetheless, selecting individuals with enough social data post-simulations results in
confident identification of pairwise relationships.”
R1, comment 11: L 244: The sentence mentions a number of sightings but the numbers look
like area sizes - please clarify.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 281
“(dragons from 5 to 40 sightings; dolphins from 20 to 70 sightings).”
R1, comment 12: L 247-249: This sentence is a bit unclear. How was accuracy measured to
determine the minimum number?
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 284 – 286.
“However, in order to be confident that we have measured home ranges accurately, we
identified the minimum number of sightings required at which the size of the home range
area stabilises (i.e. stop increasing) (Fig 2).”
R1, comment 13: Table 1: This table needs reformatting to keep the rows intact. Currently it
is very confusing.
Response: This comment has been addressed. We have reformatted table so that it is
clearer for the reader. Please see table 1.

This table shows the average half weight association index (HWI) for the observed dataset, and from random iterations. Random iterations use
increasing pairwise geographic proximity as a proxy for social associations (gprox). The gprox which matches the observed value was then used
in the final iterations (shown in bold).

R1, comment 15: Fig.1: The text is too small and almost unreadable. Also, it looks like dragons stabilize at 20, not 25.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see figure 2.
R1, comment 16: Box 1: Why should random social avoidance be considered as avoidance? If individuals do not actively avoid each other, I
would say that avoidance is absent.
Response: This comment has been addressed. We agree with the reviewer and have removed this from the box as it does not represent a
type of avoidance behaviour. Please see box 1.
Type of avoidance Definition
Spatial avoidance Individuals avoid sharing any space with each other
Individuals immediately withdraw from interacting (either
Short-term social avoidance socially or aggressively) with another individual. The
individuals may interact at a later stage.
Individuals avoid each other consistently over a long period
Long-term social avoidance (spatio-temporal avoidance) of time. Despite sharing significant portion of space, they
either do not associate, or associate very little.

Major comments
R2, comment 1: Defining avoidance: Given that the study address ‘social avoidance’ I feel it
is imperative for the authors to definitively and unambiguously define it. Social avoidance is
defined piecemeal at various points through the introduction, but mostly in terms of what it is
not (lines 38-39), measurement (lines 47-57) or examples (lines 63-67). I think a clear
statement of definition would greatly increase the clarity of the manuscript. Of particular
importance is to differentiate between ‘social avoidance’ and simply lack of social
preference- which is not the same as the difference between avoidance and random
association (lines 78+).
Response: This comment has been addressed. We have provided a definition in first
paragraph making a specific distinction between social avoidance and lack of social
preference.
Please see lines 39 – 45
“Here, we define social avoidance by the relative absence of association between individuals
that overlap geospatially. This differs from a lack of social preference in that, here,
individuals do not seek each other out, but might show mutual tolerance and occasionally
associate (e.g. as a by-product of other relationships). In social avoidance, we would predict
that individuals would not join, or be likely to leave groups, containing individuals they
avoid. Social avoidance may be one-sided or reciprocated, but with the same effect.”
R2, comment 2: Alternative explanations: The authors do not discuss possible alternative,
non-social, explanations for individual’s appearing to avoid each other. In particular,
individuals may have different resource requirements based on, for example, age, sex,
reproductive state or resource competition. This could result in individuals foraging in
different areas at different times, for example, for entirely non-social reasons. Though clearly
truly social avoidance is likely to occur (for the reasons outlined in lines 47-49) it is
important to be able to differ ate this from other alternative explanations. I feel it is worth the
author’s discuss this consideration in the manuscript.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 464 - 471
“The causality of the social avoidances identified here is likely diverse. For instance, it may
be that some avoidances are caused by the need to avoid conflict (e.g. avoidance of large of
aggressive individuals). Alternatively, some avoidances may be driven by groups of
individuals (e.g. ages of sexes) using space and/or resources at different times. Even so, the
study of avoidance has hitherto been unexplored, and in using this framework to identify
social avoidances, future research can focus on exploring the biology, and causality, of the
avoidances found here.”
R2, comment 3: Description of the method: In places I found the description of the methods
was unclear and required prior knowledge that might not be common to the general
readership of Royal Society Open Science. Specific example are pointed out in the minor
comments below. But in particular I found the first paragraphs of ‘general framework’
unclear. I found myself reading the description of the Digiroo package to understand what the
null model is and how it is usually implemented. The authors highlight that the ‘null
association model has been previously described elsewhere’ (line 111), but I feel this is
insufficient as the rest of the manuscript discusses and tests the implementation of this null
model, it is critical for readers to understand exactly what is being discussed.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please refer to editor comment 2.

“(e.g. sociability of the population),”
R2, comment 8: Line 156-165. I am unclear the justification for not simply using the same
distance that individuals are grouped together in the real data cannot also be used for the null
distribution.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 177 - 179
“This will, in most instances, result in a larger gprox than is used in the observed data. This is
because in most instances using the same distance will result in under estimating the
sociability of the population.”
and also 425 - 441 in discussion.
“In agreement with Best et al. (1), we found that the most reliable way to optimise the null
model was to alter the grouping distance proxy used within the model to ensure the null
model matched the observed level of sociability. In both species, this resulted in a grouping
distance proxy larger than is used in the observed data. This indicates, as expected, that
individuals do not move randomly. For example, the distribution of resources influences how
individuals move within their home range. Similarly, an individual’s movement may also be
influenced by the distribution of conspecifics; in particular, individuals’ spatial distribution
may not only influence social interactions, but may also, in part, be determined by them.
Disentangling whether the formation of social relationships is caused by overlapping spatial
distributions, or overlapping distributions are caused by social relationships would be
extremely challenging. Some might argue that social relationships should therefore be
assessed without controlling for spatial activity (e.g. using the Manly-Bejder permutations
implemented in SOCPROG software (2, 3)). However, in dolphins, for instance, social
preferences have been shown to exist in spite of very little spatial overlap (4, 5). Moreover,
the confounded effects of spatial distribution and social relationships would not affect the
identification of social avoidances given that these are identified as pairs of individuals which
do not associate despite sharing significant portions of their home range.”
R2, comment 9: Line 178. I recommended the authors clearly define how the p value was
calculated as per the recommendation in this paper (Ruxton and Neuhäuser 2013).
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 204
“P = <U+2211>Bj = 1 ( xj = X ) / B”
R2, comment 10: Line 198-200. Could individuals observed in close association therefore not
be acting aggressively- and therefore individuals in close association (and therefore by these
methods with a high social preference or tolerance) not actually be acting aggressively.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 234.
“Data are, however, filtered to remove those instances where aggressiveness is observed to
ensure that close social proximity reflects social tolerance.”
R2, comment 11: Line 209- How accurate is this GPS? Given its importance in calculating

Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 212 – 215
“The strength of pairwise avoidances may be assessed by using a measure of pairwise home
range overlap. For example, a pair of individuals that avoid each other and share 100% of
their home ranges could be seen to be a stronger social avoidance than in instances where a
pair share 30% of their home ranges.”

Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 459.
“(where affiliative interactions extend beyond the individuals social group to members of
other groups)”

acronym for home range. Personally I feel it isn’t very necessary to introduce an acronym
here, but if if is used it should be defined in the legend.

Dear Editor,
Thank you for the helpful feedback from both reviewers. Please find below our responses to
the reviewers comments.
Sincerely,
Kasha Strickland
Reviewer 1
R1 Comment 1: As a methods paper, the chances of other researchers adopting this
framework will be much higher if the authors share the code of their analysis, especially
because this method includes multiple stages.
Response: This comment has been addressed. All code has been shared at Dryad. Please
use temporary link http://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.tn36j Following
publication, the following link will be made available:
http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.tn36j
R1 Comment 2. L 85-87: To emphasize the novelty of the current study it will be helpful to
elaborate more about those previous cited papers about social avoidance. What was different
in their approach from the current one?
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 85 - 90.
“Other authors have offered ways to measure social avoidances (e.g. 28, 29), such as by
randomising the membership of groups, or by using pairwise spatial overlap measures as a
predictor of associations. However, we propose that the use of a spatially explicit null model
is most appropriate. This is because by accounting for individuals’ observed space use and
spatial heterogeneity, this method allows for more robust predictions of random association
patterns (27).”
R1 Comment 3. L 169: I did not understand the need to increase these measures. Please
explain why it is needed.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 170 – 175.
“Animals do not move randomly. As such, when simulations move animals randomly within
their home range (as in the null model), the number of social associations will be greatly
reduced. As a result, to optimise the null model to retain the sociability of the population, we
must manipulate certain parameters of the observed data. This can be done in a number of
ways, but we focused on two major options: increasing the distance proxy used for social
associations, or increasing the number of individuals sighted per random sampling period.@
R1 Comment 4. Fig 2: My previous comment that the number of sightings needed is 20 and
not 25 was not addressed.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 292 – 293.
“Although estimates at 20 and 25 sightings were comparable, we selected 25 sightings as a
conservative estimate in order to increase the accuracy of home range measurements.”
R1 Comment 5. L 353: How could the full home range require a smaller value than the core
home range? It doesn’t make sense.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 433 – 438.
“In dolphins, this distance was slightly larger at the core range than at the full range. This
may be because there are fewer social associations within dolphins’ core ranges in
comparison to their full, thus to obtain comparable levels of associations in the null model the
distance must be increased. Alternatively, it may be that there is less overlap between
dolphins’ core home ranges. This would also result in a greater distance proxy required to
group individuals in the null model.”

R1 Comment 7. Fig A1: What do the colours depict?
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see revised figure caption for fig
A1.
“Fig A1. Randomised points created by digiroo2, overlaid on utilisation distributions, for two
individual dolphins. Colour gradient represents the probability distribution of the individual
being sighted at different coordinates.”

R2 comment 1. Line 43-44. Slightly confusing, I initially read the ‘not’ as also applying to
the ‘likely to leave groups’. I suggest rewording for clarity.
Response. This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 44.
“. In social avoidance, we would predict that individuals would be likely either to leave or not
join groups containing individuals that they avoid.
R2 comment 2. Line 51-52. I think segregation due to differing resources requirements is
also important to mention here.
Response. We appreciate this comment from the reviewer, and have carefully
considered the suggestion. However, line 51 discusses the types of avoidance rather that
what factors may influence them. We do, however, discuss these factors in the
discussion. As such, no changes were made.
R2 comment 3. Line 52. This paper (Carter et al. 2016) might provide a useful reference for
avoidance by dominance hierarchy.
Response. This comment has been addressed. We have incorporated the suggested
reference into the revised manuscript. Please see lines 53.
“To date, such avoidance behaviour has most frequently been studied in the context of
inbreeding avoidance [11], sex segregation [12], avoidance of diseased conspecifics [13, 14]
and dominance hierarchies [15].”
R2 comment 4. Line 86. As the authors point out later Whitehead and James (ref 28) do
include space, as the current sentence is structured it implies that they do not.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 85 - 89.
“Other authors have offered ways to measure social avoidances (e.g. 28, 29), such as by
randomising the membership of groups, or by using pairwise spatial overlap measures as a
predictor of associations. However, we propose that the use of a spatially explicit null model
is most appropriate. This is because by accounting for individuals’ observed space use and
spatial heterogeneity, this method allows for more robust predictions of random association
patterns (27).”
R2 comment 5. Line 100 Acronym UD should be introduced here.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 103.
“The model does so by randomising individuals’ spatial positions within their home ranges
(the area in which individuals live), using either home range contours or utilisation
distributions (UD).”
R2 comment 6. Line 129. Here ‘Utilisation’ is spelt with a z here, elsewhere with an s.
(though I have not checked the full document)
Response: This comment has been addressed. We have corrected spelling throughout
the manuscript to read “utilization”.
R2 comment 7. Line 176. ‘gprox’ is not defined in the manuscript.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 180.
“Therefore, we suggest that to achieve comparable HWI’s, the distance at which individuals
are grouped together (gprox) should be adjusted.”
R2 comment 8. line 224-226. Word missing here ‘without ever seen associating’.
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 229.
“their home range without ever being seen to associate”
R2 comment 9: Line 230-232. This is very unclear. So ‘all individuals’ within this distance
react aggressively but some don’t?
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 234 - 236.
“Third, our observations have shown that individuals which do not tolerate each other will
react aggressively to one another within this distance.”
R2 comment 10: Line 300-301. Which average and what is the error?
Response: This comment has been addressed. Please see lines 304 - 307.
“during which an average of 54 unique individuals (± 12 individuals) and 17 pairs (± 12
pairs) were sighted per survey.”
R2 comment 11. References need to be checked. I spotted some mistakes. Especially
italisation of species name.
Response: This comment has been addressed. All references have been checked and
corrected.
R2 comment 12. Dryad: The dryad link still did not work for me
Response: This comment has been addressed. Data has been made available at Dryad.
