This paper proposed two kinds of partial least squares methods, i.e., PLS1 with polynomial basis
function and PLS2 with trigonometric polynomial basis function, for the typical interpolated and
extrapolated predictions. Experiments shows that the proposed two partial least squares
modeling method has better prediction performance than existing methods. The detailed
comments are as follows:
1. The main contribution of this paper is the construction of PLS methods for the compressor map
regression modeling. So, in the Introduction and Methodology, the authors should present some
related literature rather than the neural networks.
2. The description on PLS should be clarified. “PLS˜multiple linear regression
analysis+canonical-correlation analysis+ principal component analysis”??

This paper focuses on the prediction of the compressor performance map and proposes two kinds
of partial least squares modeling methods. This work is interesting, and proposes a feasible and
good engineering method to cope with the problem compressor modeling. Some suggestions are
as follows,
1. In section of case study, the author do not give the detailed description that how the
experiments are conducted, such as the experiment data processing.
2. As a traditional method, there is no innovation for PLS in this work. Similar works had been
published in similar journals[1,2]. What are the novel findings in the present work? The author
should give a clear description and outline what are the benefits of proposed methods.
3. There are some format problems, such as Eq.(9) and (14), please check.

In this paper, a novel compressor performance estimation approach using a new PLS model was
proposed based on trigonometric functions. The proposed approach can efficiently and
effectively predict the compressor performance under different speed and mass flow rate. The
overall technical route is reasonable with some innovation. I recommend the paper be accepted
with minor revision as follows.
1. The paper should be polished, since there are a number of typos/grammar errors. In general,
the English throughout the paper is good, however, in some sections it is hard to understand
because the English needs work. The English in the abstract needs to be touched up throughout..
2. All the parameters in the equations should be defined.
3. The format of your paper should be carefully considered according to the journal requirements.

Appendix A
Dear editor,
Thank you for your useful comments and suggestions on the language and the
structure of our manuscript. We have modified the manuscript accordingly, and
the detailed corrections are listed below point by point:
Reviewer: 1
1. The main contribution of this paper is the construction of PLS methods for
the compressor map regression modeling. So, in the Introduction and
Methodology, the authors should present some related literature rather than
the neural networks.
Response: some research of PLS has been added into the introduction section.
2. The description on PLS should be clarified. “PLS˜multiple linear regression
analysis+canonical-correlation analysis+ principal component analysis”??
Response: this excess part is deleted in the revised paper
3. Please improve the English.
“Component t and u is “
“These two requirements shows”
…….
Response: the grammatical errors have been corrected in this paper.
4. The key point in the PLS is the final regression coefficient B. Please provide a
specific formula for B.
<U+F0E5>w r
m
Response: the coefficient B is matrix, B <U+F03D>
* '
j j ,it is can be found in
j <U+F03D>1
formulation (6)
5 Please check the Eq. (16).
Response: equation (16) has been corrected
6 The time in Table 2, 8E-04 ---> 8x10^{-4}
Response: the time has been corrected
7. In the field of chemometrics, PLS is one of the most famous methods, where
PLS1 refers to the PLS with univariate regression and PLS2 refers to the
multivariate regression.
Response: in this paper, the PLS1 and PLS2 both are multivariate regression,the
difference is their basic function, the basic function is polynomial and
trigonometric function respectively.
8. Why the PLS2 shows better performance than PLS1.
Response: because the no-linear of the trigonometric function, which is more
acceptable for strong no-linear compressor performance than polynomial. The
results also show PLS2 has a better prediction accuracy and short computational
time.
Reviewer: 2
1. In section of case study, the author do not give the detailed description
that how the experiments are conducted, such as the experiment data
processing.
Response: the experiment data is derived from manufacturer, and the
experiment data are divided into three portions: sample data for building
predicting model, interpolation data and extrapolation data for verifying the
prediction accuracy of the prediction model.
2. As a traditional method, there is no innovation for PLS in this work. Similar
works had been published in similar journals[1,2]. What are the novel findings
in the present work? The author should give a clear description and outline
what are the benefits of proposed methods.
Response: in this paper, a new PLS prediction model base on trigonometric
function is proposed. Compared to traditional PLS with polynomial, the
prediction accuracy is improved greatly and the computational time is shorted
significantly. Compared to reference[1] and reference[2],the new PLS has a
similar prediction accuracy, even a little better. And avoids complex structure of
ANN-PLS and complicated kernel function of KPLS. In a word, the new PLS has a
high prediction accuracy with a simple structure simultaneously.
3. There are some format problems, such as Eq.(9) and (14), please check.
Response: these error has been corrected.
4. A careful proofreading is necessary to improve the English presentation.
For example: the problem of uppercase and lowercase letters, “3. Conclusion
and Discussion” should be “4. Conclusion and Discussion”.
Response: the revised paper has been polished carefully and the mistake has
been corrected.

Dear editor:
Thank you for your useful comments and suggestions on
the language and the structure of our manuscript. We have
modified the manuscript accordingly, and the detailed
corrections are listed below point by point:
(1) In addition to addressing all of the reviewers' and
editor's comments please also ensure that your
revised manuscript contains the following sections
before the reference list<U+3002>
Response: Ethics statement .etc explanation is

native speaker of English or a language polishing service (for
example, https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/languag

Response: according to the advice of editor, we
choose American Journal Experts as our language
polishing servicer, and grammatical errors is carefully
corrected. The order number is MF1NGX68.
Reviewer: 1
(1) In the abstract, “one make polynomial form as basis
function(PLS1), the other make trigonometric polynomial
form as basis function(PLS2).” Does the polynomial
include the
trigonometric polynomial?? This may confuse the reader.
The authors should pay attention to their expressions.
Response: the PLS1 uses a Power function polynomial as the
basis function, and the PLS2 uses a trigonometric function
polynomial as the basis function. These unclear error has
been revised. The detailed information can be find in the
second section of my manuscript.
(2) There still exist many grammatical errors in the
manuscript. The authors should carefully revise them.
Response: the grammatical errors have been revised by
language polishing servicer carefully and Comprehensively.
(3)8×10^{-4} means 8×10-4
Response: the structure of this number and similar number
has been changed and checked carefully.
(4)I have said that PLS1 and PLS2 have specific meaning in
chemometrics. Please use different
abbreviations in the manuscript.
Response: the PLS1 has been revised to PLSO, which means
old partial least squares modelling. the PLS2 has been
revised to PLSN, which means new partial least squares
modelling.
