This is an outstanding piece of anatomy. The few remark I have are all labelled in the PDF. Some
of the images are really too dark but this might be due the files accessible to me. If not, they
should be improved by either selectin a light gray background or lighter photos. Some of the
photos would be easier to read with the help of line drawings. The work is worth it. See

This MS represents a very thorough redescription of the braincase of a taxon that is particularly
important in terms of what it can reveal about archosaur evolution. This redescription not only
confirms or refutes earlier interpretations of _Euparkeria_ cranial anatomy, but provides
evidence that is crucial for determining character acquisition/loss in archosauromorphs, and
therefore polarity for future phylogenetic analyses. The authors stop short of providing such an
analysis, and in my view this is justified given the work is extensive enough as it stands. My
particular interest is in the palaeoneurological observations, and this MS provides evidence that
fuels my ideas about archosaur neurosensory evolution.
In short, the MS should be published, and I stop short of recommending acceptance without
revision only because there are some areas where it could be (slightly) improved.
3
1) The descriptions are detailed and well considered, and represent solid anatomical work.
The use of µCT to see this anatomy more clearly is well justified, but the description and
supporting figures essentially follow traditional lines. This is no bad thing, but since the late
1990s it has become normal to provide the reader with images of virtual casts of endocranial
surfaces, which are often easier to interpret on paper. These need not be complete. This has been
done to an extent in Figure 16, although I would like to see the cochlear duct as part of the
labyrinth to get some kind of idea of *how* elongate it really is. If this can only be conveyed to
the reader by providing a line drawing reconstruction, this would be VERY useful. Why do the
supplementary data include no mesh model files 3D PDFs so that the reader can investigate the
specimens using one of the many free viewers? Stereopairs are useful if only a hard copy is
available, but given the reader already has to be online to download them, there is also no reason
the full 3D morphology should not also be available to investigate.
2) Related to 1), measurements are needed. Linear measurements, angles, volumes etc. are
valuable raw data and incredibly useful for future comparison – please at least add a table
containing them. Of course, if accurate 3D models are included, the reader can take their own
measurements.
3) Without wishing to push my own work, I’m surprised the authors discuss cochlear duct
length in relation to what it can tell about hearing in extinct animals, and the floccular fossa in
relation to locomotion and VOR/VCR processing in archosaurs without citing two works that
deal with this (see below). In particular, the reason for why the flocculus might have been
expressed through the rostral SSC in archosaurs is discussed in Walsh et al. (2013).

flying ability in birds. PLoS ONE, 8(6), e67176.
The MS is well written, but there are some minor points:
General: be careful when using verbs in the active voice for anatomical description (e.g., the
dorsal margin of the cultriform process “moves” dorsally (P12, ln. 8) – it doesn’t move.
P2, ln. 59: “crocodilian” should be plural.
P4, ln. 3: Is there a word missing after “bipedal”?
P21, ln. 48: Should “bring” be ‘being’?
P30, ln. 14: Should “that” be ‘those’?
P44, ln. 27: Do you really mean “pneumatic pneumatic”?
P56, lns 45-7: You suggest the changes leading to _Euparkeria_ led to development of increased
cognitive abilities, but this comment comes somewhat out of the blue. I would recommend
expanding on why you suggest this, or delete that part of the sentence. There are theoretical
4
reasons why increased sensory and locomotory ability may be accompanied by increases in
cognitive ability, but these would need unpacking from the statement as it stands.
P74, caption for Figure 1: what is the red squiggle in part B? Caption for Figure 6: it would be
worth stating that the bone has been rendered transparent, though this really should be obvious
to the reader.

The manuscript of Sobral et al. redescribes in detail the braincase of the iconic early
archosauriform Euparkeria capensis from the Anisian of South Africa. This manuscript provides
an extremely detailed description of the osteology of this anatomical region including, for the first
time, all available specimens, mCT data from multiple specimens, and a reconstruction of the
inner hear anatomy. I congratulate the authors for this high quality piece of work that will
become a landmark at the time of studying Triassic archosauriform braincases.
The text is well written and the figures are very informative, but the drawings are very flat and it
is difficult to distinguish the overall morphology of the structures and several anatomical
features. I strongly recommend the reviewers to re-draw the interpretative drawings of the
braincase (e.g. figures 4, 8, 10) using different line thicknesses – thicker lines for borders closer to
the eye and thinner lines for more distant margins. In addition, I suggest not making continuous
margins that extend behind others because in this way the eye will notice that one line is behind
the other. If the drawings are redone following these suggestions they will have a “more 3D
appearance” than in their current form and the figure quality of the manuscript will be
considerably improved.
The authors consider that Euparkeria possesses an anterior tympanic recess, contrasting with the
interpretation of several recent authors. I agree with the presence of a depression in this region of
the parabasisphenoid, but I am sceptical that they represent the same condition. The anterior
tympanic recess is relatively deep and occupies most of the lateral surface of the parabaisphenoid
5
anteriorly to the fenestra ovalis in Silesaurus, several early dinosaurs, and theropods. However,
in Euparkeria the lateral surface of the parabasisphenoid possesses a very shallow and
considerably smaller depression. As a result, although both conditions may be homologous, I
consider that a clear statement about the differences in the character-states of Euparkeria and
dinosauriforms should be made in the text (around page 44). This statement should seek to keep
the informativeness of the presence of the anterior tympanic recess of dinosauriforms in future
phylogenetic analyses, in agreement with the scorings of Nesbitt (2011).
I haven’t noticed other major issues regarding the technical content of the manuscript, but a few
comments and suggestions are included in an edited PDF version of the manuscript. I encourage
the authors to follow them and modify the manuscript accordingly.
Therefore, I consider that the manuscript is suitable to be published in your journal after minor
modifications.
Yours sincerely,
Martín Ezcurra

3 ABSTRACT
4
5 Since its discovery, Euparkeria capensis has been a key taxon for understanding the
6
7 early evolution of archosaurs. The braincase of Euparkeria was described based on a
8
9
10 single specimen, but much uncertainty remained. For the first time, all available
11
12 braincase material of Euparkeria are reexamined through micro-computed
13
14 tomography scanning. Contrary to previous work, the parabasisphenoid does not
15
16 form the posterior border of the fenestra ovalis, but bears a dorsal projection forming
17
18
19
its anteroventral half laterally. No bone pneumatisation was found, but the lateral
20
21 depression of the parabasisphenoid may have been pneumatic. We propose the
22
23 depression likely corresponds to the anterior tympanic recess present in crown
24
25 archosaurs. Presence of a laterosphenoid is confirmed for Euparkeria. It largely
26
27 conforms to the crocodilian condition, but shows some features which make it
28
29
30 relatively more similar to the avemetatarsalian laterosphenoid. The cochlea of
31
32 Euparkeria is elongate. The metotic foramen is much enlarged and regionalized,
33
34 indicating an increase in its pressure-relief mechanism. The anterior semicircular
35
36 canal is extended and corresponds to an enlarged floccular fossa. These aspects of
37
38
39
the braincase morphology may both be related to the development of a more upright
40
41 posture and active lifestyle, and indicate further adaptations of the diapsid hearing
42
43 system to terrestriality.

52 INTRODUCTION
53
54 Archosauria, a crown group of diapsid reptiles represented today by birds and
55
56 crocodilians and including the extinct dinosaurs, is highly speciose (with over 9,000
57
58
59
species of bird and crocodilian – [1]) and has been so since the Late Triassic.

2
3 Archosaurs filled most large-bodied terrestrial ecological niches for over 150 million
4
5 years [2–4], from the Late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous. The rise of the
6
7 archosaurs to this position of ecological dominance took place following diversity
8
9
10 decline among therapsids, which had previously filled most macroscale terrestrial
11
12 niches (e.g. [2, 4, 6–13]). This faunal transition began at the end of the Permian and
13
14 continued through the Triassic [4, 13, 14]. The rise of archosaurs is a landmark
15
16 terrestrial faunal transition and an outstanding example of an ecological radiation
17
18
19
over geological timescales [3].
20
21 Euparkeria capensis is a small (known individuals reaching c. 1 m in length [15])
22
23 stem archosaur represented by the remains of over 10 individuals collected from a
24
25 single locality in Subzone B of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone [16,17] (the
26
27 uppermost biozone of the Burgersdorp Formation and the Beaufort Group), close to
28
29
30 Aliwal North, Eastern Cape, South Africa [15, 18]. Subzone B is probably Anisian
31
32 (Middle Triassic) in age (see [17]). Since its discovery, Euparkeria has been
33
34 considered to be an important taxon for our understanding of the rise and early
35
36 evolution of archosaurs. Euparkeria is nearly universally found to be either the sister
37
38
39
taxon to, or a very close relative of, Archosauria in phylogenetic analyses [3, 19–29].
40
41 For this reason Euparkeria is often used as an outgroup in phylogenetic and
42
43 evolutionary analyses of crown taxa (e.g. [30–42]), allowing the sequence and
44
45 direction of morphological changes during the radiation of Archosauria to be
46
47 understood.
48
49
50 Given its phylogenetic position and lack of striking autapomorphies, the
51
52 morphology of Euparkeria has been considered to potentially approach that of the
53
54 ancestor of Archosauria, and thus may shed light on the early evolution of archosaurs
55
56 (see [43]). The gracile, cursorial body plan of Euparkeria represents a morphological
57
58
59
stage intermediate between more “sprawling” non-archosaurian archosauromorph

3 taxa and the fully erect, and often bipedal [13, 44, 45]. Beyond this, Euparkeria itself
4
5 represents a part of the broader radiation of archosauromorphs, within which the
6
7 crown radiation is nested. Although often used as a phylogenetic outgroup to
8
9
10 Archosauria, Euparkeria can also be seen as displaying a relatively derived
11
12 braincase morphology (e.g. relatively high, dorsoventrally elongated
13
14 parabasisphenoid, elongated semicircular canals – see below) representing the
15
16 culmination of morphological developments which begin further down the archosaur
17
18
19
stem.
20
21 The braincase of Euparkeria was originally described by Ewer [15], based on the
22
23 holotype – SAM-PK-5867, SAM-PK-7696, and UMZC T.692 (“Watson’s specimen A”;
24
25 formerly R 527), in a monographic treatment of the taxon. Subsequently an isolated
26
27 braincase from specimen SAM-PK-7696 was further acid prepared, and was
28
29
30 described by Cruickshank [46]. Evans [47] figured this same isolated braincase and
31
32 used it as a comparator in her treatment of the braincase of Prolacerta broomi.
33
34 Welman [48] figured both SAM-PK-7696 and the braincase of the holotype, which
35
36 had been further mechanically prepared in the interim. Welman [48] compared the
37
38
39
morphology of the braincase of Euparkeria to that of birds, dinosaurs and
40
41 crocodilians, and came to the controversial conclusion that Euparkeria was more
42
43 closely related to birds than to dinosaurs or crocodilians, resurrecting the idea that
44
45 birds and dinosaurs had separate origins among the “thecodonts”, a paraphyletic
46
47 assemblage of stem archosaurs and early pseudosuchians [49]. Gower and Weber
48
49
50 [43] thoroughly redescribed the braincase of Euparkeria, based primarily on UMZC
51
52 T.692. In addition to providing a comprehensive reference work, these authors
53
54 presented evidence refuting the presence or importance of most of the anatomical
55
56 features used by Welman [48] to link Euparkeria to birds to the exclusion of other
57
58
59
archosaurs.

3 Here, we provide a thorough redescription of the osteology of the braincase of
4
5 Euparkeria, building on the work of Gower and Weber [43] and bringing new
6
7 clarification to points of doubt, documenting new information, and confirming areas
8
9
10 where our understanding is limited by the material. Although the work of Gower and
11
12 Weber [43] was thorough given the material available to the authors, recent
13
14 advances in computed tomography (CT) allow new insights. All material pertaining to
15
16 the braincase of Euparkeria was available for us to examine, and we were able to CT
17
18
19
scan the specimen available to Gower and Weber [43] (UMZC T.692), the holotype
20
21 (SAM-PK-5867), specimen SAM-PK-6047A, and the isolated braincase SAM-PK-
22
23 7696.
24
25 This approach allows us to provide additional information on sutures and contacts
26
27 between elements, as well as details of the internal structures of the braincase and
28
29
30 the morphology of the inner ear. Furthermore, we provide thorough documentation of
31
32 the element generally regarded as a laterosphenoid in Euparkeria, describing for the
33
34 first time the morphology of this element in SAM-PK-5867, and conducting an
35
36 extensive discussion of its morphology and potential homology.
37
38
39
Our contribution makes the braincase of Euparkeria one of the best-documented
40
41 early archosauriform braincases and provides a reference point for archosauriform
42
43 morphologists that will contribute to a growing understanding of the rise and
44
45 evolutionary radiation of the archosaurs.

37
38
39
Basioccipital
40
41 The basioccipital forms the majority of the occipital condyle, with only the
42
43 dorsolateral corners of the condyle formed by the exoccipitals. The entire occipital
44
45 condyle (including the exoccipital contribution) is hemispherical, with the dorsal
46
47 margin being very gently concave in posterior view (Figures 1B, 7B, 11B). There is no
48
49
50 pronounced ridge delimiting the condyle from the condyle neck (Figure 11B), unlike in
51
52 Dorosuchus neoetus [50], nor is there a notochordal pit. The contribution of the
53
54 basioccipital to the border of the foramen magnum is very limited, not accounting for
55
56 more than the middle-third of the ventral border of the foramen (Figures 1B, 6A, 11B).
57
58
59
Thus, the interpretation of Cruickshank [46] (fig. 2; also Gower and Weber [43], fig.
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 8 of 103
1
2
3 1b) to some extent exaggerated the basioccipital contribution to the foramen
4
5 magnum. The basioccipital articulates with the exoccipital in a dorsomedial-
6
7 ventrolateral orientated plane, below the foramen for cranial nerve (CN) XII (Figure
8
9
10 6A, C).
11
12 Anterior to the occipital condyle the basioccipital expands laterally to form the
13
14 basioccipital contribution to the basal tubera (Figures 7B, 8B). A low, rounded ridge
15
16 extends obliquely from the occipital condyle to about half way down the contribution
17
18
19
on each side, separating a more horizontally orientated ventral surface of the
20
21 basioccipital from a more vertically orientated dorsal surface (Figure 7B, ri). In UMCZ
22
23 T.692, the dorsal parts of the expanded part of the basioccipital contribution on each
24
25 side appear to be missing [43] (fig. 4). This ridge seems to be the posterior
26
27 counterpart of the concave articular surface (for the parabasisphenoid) that is located
28
29
30 on the anterior face of the contribution of the basioccipital to the basal tuber, as seen
31
32 in Prolacerta [47] (fig. 6).
33
34 The basal tubera are clearly separated in posterior view, but are connected to
35
36 each other by a low ridge (Figures 1D, 11A, ri) which formed the posterior margin of
37
38
39
the basioccipital–basisphenoid fossa [51]. This fossa forms the posterior part of the
40
41 ventral median pharyngeal recess (sensu Witmer [52]; Figure 7B, mpr); the posterior
42
43 surface of the parabasisphenoid lacks the ‘intertuberal plate’ that separates the
44
45 basioccipital-basisphenoid fossa from the rest of the median pharyngeal recess in
46
47 some other Triassic archosauriforms (see, for example [51]).
48
49
50 The basioccipital also forms the floor of the metotic foramen. The suture
51
52 between basioccipital and parabasisphenoid extends in a gently meandering line
53
54 transversely across the braincase, ending laterally close to the posteroventral corner
55
56 of the fenestra ovalis (Figure 3D). Thus the basioccipital contributes to the posterior
57
58
59
60

Page 9 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 portion of the floor of the fenestra ovalis; in lateral view, the suture line extends
4
5 straight ventrally (Figure 6C).
6
7 The lateral margin of the basioccipital dorsal to the basal tuber forms the
8
9
10 posterior margin of the “unossified gap” of Gower & Weber [43] (Figure 1E, 2E,
11
12 un.gp) also bounded by the ventral ramus of the opisthotic and the
13
14 parabasisphenoid; the gap is well preserved as an open channel on the right hand
15
16 side of SAM-PK-7696 and in SAM-PK-5867 (see below; Figure 9A, B, un.gp).
17
18
19
20
21 Parabasisphenoid
22
23 The parabasisphenoid forms the ventral part of the braincase anterior to the
24
25 basioccipital, ventral to the prootics. The basal tubera are displaced dorsally in
26
27 comparison to the basipterygoid processes (Figure 13B), and the part of the
28
29
30 parabasisphenoid between them can thus be described as vertically rather than
31
32 horizontally aligned (following Gower and Sennikov [51]). The basipterygoid
33
34 processes are well preserved in SAM-PK-K6047A (Figure 12B, C, E, F), in SAM-PK-
35
36 5867 (Figure 7B, 11A), and UMCZ T.692 (Figure 13A, B, E). They are slightly
37
38
39
anteroposteriorly elongated ovals in ventral view, and anterodorsally-posteroventrally
40
41 elongated ovals in lateral view. The distal tips of the basipterygoid processes are
42
43 ventrolaterally and slightly posteriorly directed.
44
45 The ventral surface of the parabasisphenoid forms the anterior two thirds of
46
47 the median pharyngeal recess (Figures 1D, 7B, mpr) between the basal tubera and
48
49
50 the basipterygoid processes. The recess bears no foramina. The suture with the
51
52 basioccipital extends across the recess in a gently meandering line which is slightly
53
54 anteriorly convexly curved in overall trajectory in ventral view (Figures 1D, 3D, 7B).
55
56 The anterior bases of the basal tubera are connected to each other by rounded lips
57
58
59
of bone that meet in the midline, forming the anterior border of the median
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 10 of 103
1
2
3 pharyngeal recess. They join with a median ridge extending from the ventral surface
4
5 of the cultriform process, and together form a tubercle which projects posteriorly
6
7 under the anterior part of the median pharyngeal recess (Figure 7B).
8
9
10 CT data show the suture between parabasisphenoid and prootic extends
11
12 obliquely from posterolaterally to anteromedially in dorsal view (Figure 6B, s.bs.pr).
13
14 However, the parabasisphenoid bears an ascending process posteriorly that
15
16 conceals part of the lateral surface of the prootic and which forms the anteroventral
17
18
19
border of the fenestra ovalis (Figure 2E, apB). Thus, in lateral view, the contact
20
21 between prootic and parabasisphenoid can be described in two parts: the first, more
22
23 posterior part, is anteroventrally inclined and extends from the fenestra ovalis to the
24
25 groove for CN VII; the second, more anterior part, is anterodorsally inclined and
26
27 starts anterior to the “lateral depression” of the parabasisphenoid and the groove for
28
29
30 CN VII (Figure 2B). This interpretation of the relationships between these two bones
31
32 differs from that of previous authors and is discussed below.
33
34 The basal tubera are mostly lost in SAM-PK-5867 and completely lost in SAM-
35
36 PK-7696. However, based on what remains in those two specimens and on UMZC
37
38
39
T.692 and SAM-PK-6047A, the parabasisphenoid contribution to the basal tubera
40
41 extends posteroventrally and laterally from near the anteroventral margin of the
42
43 fenestra ovalis (Figures 12F, 13B, D, E). On the right hand side of SAM-PK-7696, the
44
45 lateral surface of the parabasisphenoid contribution to the basal tuber bears a deep,
46
47 posteroventrally open sulcus - the semilunar depression of Gower and Weber [43]
48
49
50 and Evans [53] (Figure 1E, 2E, sd). This cannot have been an articulation for the
51
52 ventral ramus of the opisthotic (as suggested by Evans [53]), as the braincase is
53
54 articulated and the ventral ramus of the opisthotic instead ends more posteriorly,
55
56 close to the basioccipital contribution to the basal tuber, and connected to the
57
58
59
parabasisphenoid laterally by a thin strip of bone. Posterior to the semilunar
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 11 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 depression, and anterior to the distal end of the ventral ramus of the opisthotic, is the
4
5 “unossified gap” (Figure 1E, 2E, un.gp).
6
7 Anterior to the anterodorsal extremity of the basal tuber, the lateral surface of
8
9
10 the parabasisphenoid is deeply concave (the “lateral depression” of Gower and
11
12 Weber [43]; Figure 2E, ld). This concavity is confluent with the groove for the palatine
13
14 branch of cranial nerve VII (Figure 2E, CN VIIpal), which extends down the lateral
15
16 surface of the prootic and would have continued down the anterolateral surface of the
17
18
19
basipterygoid process as an osseous groove, as in other reptilians (e.g. Captorhinus
20
21 [54]; Ctenosaura [55]; Dysalotosaurus – [56]), but is not observable due to
22
23 preservation.
24
25 In lateral view, the posterior third of the braincase floor is relatively horizontal,
26
27 though convex (Figure 3B). More anteriorly, the floor slopes ventrally (Figure 3B), and
28
29
30 a low median ridge (Figure 3D, md.rd) divides this sloping section into left and right
31
32 halves, both of which are gently concave. The anterior third of the floor shows two
33
34 large, oval depressions (Figure 3B, D, ov.dp) with their longer axes extending
35
36 posterolaterally-anteromedially. These depressions are a little deeper anteriorly than
37
38
39
posteriorly, and they are separated by a thick, dorsally flat strip of the braincase floor,
40
41 which may have connected to the ridge seen more posteriorly on the braincase floor
42
43 (this cannot be ascertained because of damage to the braincase floor in SAM-PK-
44
45 7696).
46
47 The ventral surface of the parabasiphenoid between the basipterygoid
48
49
50 processes is very gently concave, with a pronounced median ridge extending from
51
52 the anterior margin of the median pharyngeal recess to the base of the cultriform
53
54 process (=rostrum) of the parabasisphenoid (Figure 11A). This ventral surface bears,
55
56 on each side, a foramen for the internal carotid artery (Figure 11A, ica), placed at the
57
58
59
posteromedial base of the basipterygoid process, immediately anterior to the lips of
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 12 of 103
1
2
3 bone connecting the basal tubera (see above). The cultriform process (Figure 12C–
4
5 E, 13, cp) is elongated and tapers to a distal point, and its dorsal margin dips slightly
6
7 ventrally close to its base then moves dorsally again yet further proximally. In cross
8
9
10 section the cultriform process is deeply excavated dorsally, forming a U shape in
11
12 anterior view.
13
14 In anterior view, the suture between the parabasisphenoid and the prootic
15
16 extends from ventrolaterally to dorsomedially, through the foramen of CN VI on each
17
18
19
side (the margin of which is thus formed half by the parabasisphenoid and half by the
20
21 prootic), meeting in an apex at the midline close to the dorsal border of the dorsum
22
23 sellae (Figure 2A, s.bs.pr). The posterior wall of the hypophyseal fossa is gently
24
25 concave transversely and has a central, low ridge extending dorsoventrally. The
26
27 clinoid processes (Figures 1A, 2A, cp) protrude a small distance medially over the
28
29
30 posterior wall of the hypophyseal fossa, concealing the lateral borders of the
31
32 foramina for CN VI when viewed directly anteriorly.
33
34
35
36 Exoccipital
37
38
39
The contact between exoccipital and basioccipital is very short (Figure 6),
40
41 confirming the observation of Gower and Weber [43] that the exoccipital is restricted
42
43 to the pillar between the foramen magnum and the metotic foramen. The lateral
44
45 surface of this pillar is smooth and shows no lateral ridge (sensu Gower [57]; Figure
46
47 1E). The exoccipitals form the dorsolateral corners of the occipital condyle, and in
48
49
50 SAM-PK-7696 do not meet at the midline to exclude the basioccipital from the
51
52 foramen magnum (Figures 1B, 2B). On first inspection SAM-PK-5867 presents the
53
54 impression that the exoccipitals did exclude the basioccipital from the foramen
55
56 magnum (Figure 7B), but this appears to be due to mediolateral compression of the
57
58
59
braincase compounded by a preparation artefact. In UMZC T.692 the left side of the
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 13 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 braincase is disarticulated and was not scanned with the main block of the material.
4
5 The right exoccipital, however, is preserved in contact with the basioccipital (Figure
6
7 14B) and a line of fracture likely represents their contact. In this specimen, the
8
9
10 exoccipital extends further medially than in SAM-PK-5867, almost reaching the
11
12 midline, but does not seem to contact its counterpart, as noted by Gower and Weber
13
14 [43]. Although the braincase is not laterally compressed, the exoccipital seems to be
15
16 somewhat displaced medially from its original position, decreasing the distance
17
18
19
between left and right elements. In addition, the exoccipital facets on the basioccipital
20
21 are directed slightly outwards, again indicating lack of contact. We thus conclude that
22
23 there is a basioccipital contribution to the foramen magnum, but this contribution
24
25 seems to be smaller in SAM-PK-5867 and UMZC T.692 than in SAM-PK-7696. The
26
27 basioccipital is missing in SAM-PK-6047A.
28
29
30 The anterior two-thirds of the suture between the exoccipital and opisthotic are
31
32 identifiable in CT scans of SAM-PK-7696, and in posterior view it is slanted
33
34 dorsomedially-ventrolaterally (Figure 6B, s.eo.op). Exactly where this suture emerges
35
36 posteriorly is not entirely clear in any specimen, but based on the part of the suture
37
38
39
visible internally in the scans, its path would roughly describe an arch that begins at
40
41 the base of the paroccipital process and reaches up to the dorsal border of the
42
43 foramen magnum. On the left side of SAM-PK-7696 there is a meandering line that
44
45 broadly follows this same arch (Figure 1B, red line; 2B); this line separates a more
46
47 ventral, smoother and depressed area from a more dorsal, rougher, and more convex
48
49
50 area. This line almost certainly represents the exoccipital-opisthotic suture as it
51
52 follows its expected trajectory, though its continuation cannot be traced internally; a
53
54 slight groove is visible in SAM-PK-5867 in a similar position to the line in SAM-PK-
55
56 7696 (Figure 11B, blue line). In SAM-PK-7696 the posterior surface of the exoccipital
57
58
59
is damaged at the point where this probable suture line would contact the border of

2
3 the foramen magnum, preventing clarity regarding the exact contribution of the
4
5 exoccipital to the foramen. However, it is probable, based on the suture line within the
6
7 bone, that the exoccipital formed the lateral rim of the foramen magnum as well as
8
9
10 the lateral parts of its dorsal rim. In SAM-PK-7696 the supraoccipital-opisthotic suture
11
12 cannot be located, but in SAM-PK-5867, the supraoccipital-opisthotic suture line hits
13
14 the probable exoccipital-opisthotic suture line immediately lateral to the border of the
15
16 foramen magnum (Figure 11B, red line), meaning that the opisthotic is excluded from
17
18
19
the foramen, and the suture between the supraoccipital and exoccipital consists of a
20
21 brief point contact at the border of the foramen magnum.
22
23 A depressed area (see above) below the exoccipital-opisthotic suture line is
24
25 clearly present on the posterior surface of the exoccipital in SAM-PK-7696, being
26
27 especially pronounced on the right hand side (Figure 1B). This feature is less
28
29
30 apparent in SAM-PK-5867 (Figure 11B). Whether this area represents a particular
31
32 functional feature is unclear, but it certainly does not represent any exit foramina, as
33
34 the CT scans show no traces of internal paths. In SAM-PK-7696, on the right lateral
35
36 surface of the exoccipital, there are two well-marked foramina for the anterior and
37
38
39
posterior branches of CN XII (Figure 5A, CN XIIa, CN XIIp) – the posterior foramen
40
41 (CNXIIp) is somewhat larger and more dorsally located. A short distance anterior and
42
43 ventral to these, there seems to be a third foramen, which, in the CT scans, does not
44
45 penetrate far into the bone (Figure 5A, ?CN XI). If a real feature, however, this
46
47 foramen could represent an independent exit for the accessory nerve (CN XI). On the
48
49
50 left side, the foramen for the posterior branch of CN XII is clearly visible, but because
51
52 the area anterior to it is somewhat damaged, the foramen for the anterior branch of
53
54 CN XII is located more medially. There is no corresponding foramen to the third
55
56 foramen seen on the right hand side. In SAM-PK-5867, only one foramen is clearly

10 Opisthotic
11
12 The opisthotic forms most of the paroccipital processes and the lateral wall of
13
14 the braincase between the fenestra ovalis and the metotic foramen. Contrary to
15
16 Cruickshank [46], the opisthotic does not participate in the borders of the foramen
17
18
19
magnum. The contact between opisthotic and prootic is broad (sensu Nesbitt [29],
20
21 state 0 of character 105), being dorsoventrally extended and reaching up to half the
22
23 length of the paroccipital process (Figure 6). However, the prootic contribution to the
24
25 paroccipital process is restricted to a sheet of bone covering the anterior surface of
26
27 the process, the bulk of the process being formed by the opisthotic (Figure 1A, E).
28
29
30 The paroccipital processes protrude posterolaterally and dorsally (Figures 1, 7,
31
32 11). They are oval in cross section and the shaft is gently twisted along its length, so
33
34 that the dorsal surface twists to face more posterodorsally at the distal end. The distal
35
36 tips are gently rounded and separated from the main shaft of the processes by a
37
38
39
slight constriction. The distalmost tip of the right process is missing in SAM-PK-7696.
40
41 The paroccipital processes are excavated postero- and anteroventrally by the dorsal
42
43 borders of the metotic foramen and the fenestra ovalis (recessus stapedialis),
44
45 respectively. These excavations are separated by a ridge (corresponding to the crista
46
47 interfenestralis of Oelrich [55]) ascending from the ventral ramus of the opisthotic and
48
49
50 ending approximately half way along the paroccipital process shaft (Figure 5A, ci).
51
52 The ventral ramus of the opisthotic (Figures 1B, F, 2B, F, vrop) descends
53
54 ventrally from the base of the paroccipital process and bends gently posteriorly. It
55
56 separates the fenestra ovalis anteriorly from the metotic foramen posteriorly. In
57
58
59
posterior view, the ventral ramus of the opisthotic is clearly visible, with its lateral
60

1
2
3 margin offset laterally from that of the exoccipital by a distance roughly equal to the
4
5 width of the exoccipital (Figures 1B, 2B, vrop). In posterior view, the lateral margin of
6
7 the ventral ramus of the opisthotic is laterally concave, and extends from
8
9
10 ventromedially to dorsolaterally. The distal end of the ventral ramus of the opisthotic
11
12 is roughly level with the dorsoventral midpoint of the occipital condyle. In transverse
13
14 cross section, the long axis of the ramus is anteromedially to posterolaterally
15
16 directed; the perilymphatic duct would thus have extended anterolaterally to
17
18
19
posteromedially (see below). On the anterior surface of the left ventral ramus of
20
21 SAM-PK-7696 the well-marked lagenar crest protrudes anteriorly (Figure 5A, B,
22
23 lg.cr), separating the vestibular region dorsally from the cochlear region ventrally.
24
25 This structure is missing on the right side. The distal end of the ventral ramus of the
26
27 opisthotic is expanded laterally, anteriorly and posteriorly compared to the rest of the
28
29
30 shaft, but this expansion does not compare to that seen in some other stem
31
32 archosaur taxa (e.g. Garjainia prima [51]).
33
34 On the ventral border of the right fenestra ovalis in SAM-PK-7696, there is a
35
36 thin sagittal bony contact between the ventral ramus of the opisthotic and the
37
38
39
posterior region of the parabasisphenoid (Figure 2E, bb). This bony contact forms the
40
41 lateral limit of a small foramen (Figure 2E, ug), the medial edge of which is delimited
42
43 by the lateral surfaces of the basioccipital and the parabasisphenoid forming the
44
45 braincase floor. The ventrolaterally open area ventral to this foramen was identified
46
47 by Cruickshank [46] as the lagenar recess, whereas Gower & Weber [43] identify it
48
49
50 as an “unossified gap”. This area was probably covered by cartilage, with the tip of
51
52 the lagena projecting through the foramen – see below.
53
54 On the dorsal part of the medial wall of the opisthotic, there are two confluent,
55
56 medially open depressions (Figure 3A, B, cc, psc). One is smaller and positioned
57
58
59
more anterodorsally than the other. The first corresponds to the common, dorsal
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 17 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 openings of the anterior and posterior semicircular canals, termed common crus. The
4
5 second, posteroventral one corresponds to the posterior ampulla, from which the
6
7 posterior semicircular canal leaves the vestibule. On the right hand side of SAM-PK-
8
9
10 7696, the ventral ramus of the opisthotic has a large, rounded notch occupying all of
11
12 the region ventral to the confluence of these two depressions (Figure 3C, 5C, pf).
13
14 This notch marks the border between the otic capsule and the occipital region,
15
16 through which passed the perilymphatic duct. The notch is, however, too large to be
17
18
19
considered only the lateral border of the perilymphatic foramen, and it may have
20
21 housed other structures such as part of the perilymphatic sac (see inner ear and
22
23 discussion sections below).
24
25
26
27 Prootic
28
29
30 The prootic forms the lateral wall of the braincase posterior to the
31
32 laterosphenoid and anterior to the fenestra ovalis (Figures 1E, F, 2E, F, pro).
33
34 Posterolaterally the prootic extends onto the anterior surface of the paroccipital
35
36 process in a laterally tapering sheet that reaches to just under half way along the
37
38
39
paroccipital process (Figure 1A, E, F). Anteriorly, the prootic contacts the
40
41 laterosphenoid, and forms the dorsal, posterior and ventral margins of the large
42
43 foramen for the trigeminal nerve (CN V), with the laterosphenoid forming the anterior
44
45 margin. The CN V foramen (Figure 1F, CN V) is oval, with its long axis extending
46
47 posteroventrally to anterodorsally. The anterodorsal extremity of the prootic forms the
48
49
50 ventral floor of a recess (Figures 1A, C, E, F, 3A, 5B, D, vcd) which was roofed by the
51
52 supraoccipital dorsomedially and, when in articulation, by the parietal dorsolaterally.
53
54 The laterosphenoid may have formed the anterior wall of this channel, though it is
55
56 disarticulated in all specimens. The smooth and rounded nature of this recess, and
57
58
59
the relationships of the cited elements as seen in other taxa suggest that it was not
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 18 of 103
1
2
3 simply an articulation for the parietal and/or laterosphenoid, but a channel for the
4
5 vena capitis dorsalis [56, 58–60], which would have connected the braincase cavity
6
7 with the temporal region. In the CT scans of SAM-PK-5867, whether such a channel
8
9
10 is present is difficult to assess, but there does appear to be a rounded opening which
11
12 may represent its lateral extreme (Figure 11B). A corresponding structure identified
13
14 as a venous sinus is found on the supraoccipital of Osmolskina czatkowicensis [61].
15
16 Immediately posterior to the lateral part of this recess is a small posterolaterally
17
18
19
directed depression with marked borders which appears to have been a facet for the
20
21 parietal (Figure 5A, fc.pa).
22
23 Posteroventral to the foramen for CN V, the prootic is slightly depressed,
24
25 indicating the position of a gasserian ganglion external to the brain cavity (Figures
26
27 1E, F, 2E, F, ggf). A sharp crest (here referred to as crest 1, to avoid terminological
28
29
30 confusion) extends ventrally down from the paroccipital process (Figure 2E, cr1),
31
32 forming the anterior margin of the stapedial groove and then, ventral to the dorsal
33
34 margin of the fenestra ovalis, the anterior margin of the groove for the hyomandibular
35
36 branch of CN VII (CN VIIhym, Figure 1E). A lower crest (crest 2; Figure 2E, cr2)
37
38
39
originates from this crest at the dorsal margin of the fenestra ovalis, and forms the
40
41 posterior margin of the dorsalmost part of the groove for CN VIIhym and then the
42
43 anterior margin of the fenestra ovalis. Crest 1 becomes much lower and arcs
44
45 anteriorly then posteriorly again just below the exit for CN VII, before descending
46
47 directly ventrally and approaching the posterior wall of the groove for the palatal
48
49
50 branch of CN VII (CN VIIpal). Further ventrally still, the wall of the groove for CN VIIpal
51
52 and crest 1 diverge once again below to form the posterior and anterior margins of
53
54 the lateral depression, respectively. A bulging ridge marking the path of the lateral
55
56 semicircular canal follows the line of crest 1 dorsal to the foramen for CN VII, but is
57
58
59
inset anterodorsally from the crest. Once it reaches a point level with the foramen for
60

1
2
3 CN VII, this ridge curves sharply anterodorsally, bordering the dorsal margin of the
4
5 depression for the gasserian ganglion (Figure 2E). In lateral view, the posterior
6
7 surface of the prootic forming the anterior border of the fenestra ovalis of SAM-PK-
8
9
10 7696 bears a lagenar crest (Figure 5A, B, lg.cr), a smoothly rounded protuberance
11
12 that marks the division of the vestibular and cochlear regions of the inner ear.
13
14 The medial wall of the prootic possesses a large, round and very deeply
15
16 marked fossa immediately dorsal and a short distance posterior to the foramen for
17
18
19
CN V - the floccular fossa (= fossa subarcuata, auricular fossa; Figure 1A, 3A, B, ff).
20
21 The posterior wall of the fossa has a marked, deeper subregion that seems to enter
22
23 the bone but does not lead off within it. Ventral to the floccular fossa, the left foramen
24
25 for CN V is separated from the inner ear by an elevated and rounded ridge (Figures
26
27 5B, 4, rd). Posterior to this ridge, close to its base, there seems to be a dorsoventral
28
29
30 sulcus, perhaps leading dorsally to the foramen for CN VII or ventrally to the brain
31
32 cavity (Figure 3B, su). The foramen for CN VII is connected to the oval depressions
33
34 (see above) on the anterior third of the braincase floor by a groove (Figure 4,
35
36 cg.ov.VII).
37
38
39
Ventral to the foramen for the trigeminal nerve, the prootic projects as a thin
40
41 process – the anterior inferior process (Figure 2E, aip). The left and right processes
42
43 are connected by a sheet of bone, the dorsum sellae (Figure 2A, ds). The dorsum
44
45 sellae is bordered laterally by ridges, which connect ventrally to the protruded
46
47 margins of the clinoid processes (Figure 2A, ri; see parabasisphenoid). The middle
48
49
50 third of the dorsal margin of the dorsum sellae dips ventrally to the midline, thus
51
52 forming a V-shape in anterior view (Figure 1A). The dorsum sellae forms the dorsal
53
54 rim of the foramen of the abducens nerve (Figure 2A, CN VI), and is directed
55
56 anteroventrally rather than anteriorly, unlike, for example, in Erythorosuchus
57
58
59
africanus [62]. On the dorsal part of the lateral surface of the anterior inferior process,
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 20 of 103
1
2
3 immediately ventral to the trigeminal opening, is a low, very slight anteroposteriorly
4
5 extending narrow ridge (Figure 2F, ri); it is less pronounced than in Dorosuchus
6
7 neoetus (PIN 1579/62), and is perhaps better described as a thickening of the bone
8
9
10 along the margin of the trigeminal foramen rather than a true ridge.
11
12
13
14 Supraoccipital
15
16 The supraoccipital is a broad, flat element that forms the posterodorsal part of
17
18
19
the roof of the braincase and forms the medial third of the dorsal border of the
20
21 foramen magnum (Figures 1B, C, 2, 7B, 9C, 11B, so). The supraoccipital partially
22
23 housed the common crus, the posterior portion of the anterior semicircular canal and
24
25 the anterior part of the posterior semicircular canal.
26
27 Laterally and posterolaterally, the supraoccipital contacts the opisthotics. The
28
29
30 entire line of this suture is unclear in SAM-PK-7696. In SAM-PK-5867 however, in
31
32 dorsal view, this suture extends in a laterally concave arc from the lateral margin of
33
34 the contact between the exoccipital and the supraoccipital at the lateral margin of the
35
36 foramen magnum to the anteromedial margin of the paroccipital process (Figure
37
38
39
11B). Anterior to the end of this suture, the supraoccipital contacts the prootic along
40
41 the dorsolateral extreme of the braincase (Figures 2E, F, 11B). The suture line could
42
43 not be identified in SAM-PK-7696, but in SAM-PK-5867 it describes a gentle,
44
45 medially concave arc from the lateralmost point of the suture between supraoccipital
46
47 and opisthotic to the anterior border of the supraoccipital, at the dorsomedial corner
48
49
50 of the recess of the vena capitis dorsalis (Figure 11B, vcd). The lateral part of the
51
52 dorsal margin of the supraoccipital thus forms the medial and posterior margins of the
53
54 recess (see Prootic above), which is anteriorly and dorsally open; immediately medial
55
56 to this, the supraoccipital also roofs the medial section of this hollow.

2
3 In posterior view (Figure 11B) the dorsal margin of the supraoccipital is raised
4
5 into a convexity at the midline and into another, smaller convexity laterally on either
6
7 side. Gentle ridges or raised strips extend back from each of these convexities
8
9
10 (Figure 11B, ridges), with those extending from the lateral convexities moving
11
12 towards the midline posteriorly (Figure 11B); all three of these ridges disappear
13
14 around half way to the border of the foramen magnum.

19
Laterosphenoid
20
21 In SAM-PK-5867, the braincase wall anterior to the prootic is fully ossified as
22
23 the laterosphenoid, although disarticulated from the remainder of the braincase
24
25 (Figure 15), indicating that it may not have been firmly sutured in life. In SAM-PK-
26
27 5867, the laterosphenoid is displaced anteriorly and (probably associated with the
28
29
30 lateral compression of the specimen seen on its left side) greatly tilted to the right in
31
32 relation to the occipital area of the skull, so it is visible in dorsal view through the right
33
34 orbit (Figures 15, 17A). A single disarticulated bone identified as a right
35
36 laterosphenoid has been described from SAM-PK-7696 (Clark et al. 1993); we find
37
38
39
that whether this is indeed a laterosphenoid (and/or the same ossification of the
40
41 anterior braincase wall as preserved in SAM-PK-5867) is difficult to assess.
42
43 Fragments of bone were attributed to the laterosphenoid in UMZC T.692 [43, 63] and
44
45 this attribution is confirmed by CT scans, but their poor preservation prevents
46
47 morphological information bring obtained from them. The laterosphenoid of SAM-PK-
48
49
50 6047A is missing entirely. The presence of a laterosphenoid was noted by Clark et al.
51
52 [63] for SAM-PK-5867, but that specimen was not fully prepared at that time to allow
53
54 a more complete description. Although we agree with these authors on the
55
56 identification of this structure as a laterosphenoid, we note some differences to the
57
58
59
laterosphenoid of extant crocodilians, potentially indicating presence of more
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 22 of 103
1
2
3 elements (fused together) in Euparkeria than the “true” laterosphenoid (see below).
4
5 Irrespective of homology, the laterosphenoid of Euparkeria will be described here as
6
7 a single element. The description is based on the right side of the laterosphenoid of
8
9
10 SAM-PK-5867, unless stated otherwise, as this is more clearly visible both visually
11
12 and in the CT scans.
13
14 The laterosphenoid of Euparkeria is fundamentally similar to that of
15
16 Proterosuchus alexanderi (NMQR 1484), but less anteroposteriorly elongated, and its
17
18
19
anterior part is more ventrally extended (Figure 15B, C). In dorsal view, the posterior
20
21 part of the dorsal rim extends straight anteriorly, then bends sharply anterolaterally to
22
23 form the posterior part of the capitate process, and then curves smoothly
24
25 anteromedially again (Figure 15A). In lateral view (Figure 15B), the dorsal half of the
26
27 posterior margin of the laterosphenoid is convexly rounded. Although it shows a
28
29
30 subtle projection, it has no posteriorly extending process as developed as that seen
31
32 in Proterosuchus [63]. The dorsal half of the posterior margin of the laterosphenoid is
33
34 separated from the ventral half by a notch, which forms the anterior rim of the
35
36 foramen for CN V (Figure 15B, CN V). The border of this notch is depressed laterally,
37
38
39
as seen in the prootic, marking the position of the Gasserian ganglion. The ventral
40
41 half of the posterior margin of the laterosphenoid is still in articulation with the anterior
42
43 inferior process of the prootic (Figure 9A, 15B, C); the laterosphenoid does not
44
45 extend below the articulation with the prootic, and would not have contacted the
46
47 parabasisphenoid. The lateral surface of the posterior part of laterosphenoid is
48
49
50 smooth and delimited anteriorly by two rounded crests: a more dorsal crest, the
51
52 laterosphenoid buttress (=cotylar crest of Clark et al. [63]; Figure 15 B, C, ls.bt), and
53
54 a more ventral crest, the tensor crest (sensu Holliday & Witmer [64]; Figure 15B, C,
55
56 tc).

2
3 The laterosphenoid buttress curves first anteroventrally and then
4
5 posteroventrally from the capitate process (Figure 15, cp) to form an anteriorly
6
7 convex outline with the tensor crest. Both structures, however, do not contact each
8
9
10 other, leaving a space between them flush with the lateral surface of the
11
12 laterosphenoid, at about its midheight. The capitate process (= postorbital process of
13
14 Holliday & Witmer [64]:718; Figure 15, cp) is very robust in comparison to the rest of
15
16 the laterosphenoid, and protrudes from the main body of the laterosphenoid laterally.
17
18
19
The tensor crest (Figure 15B, C, tc) of Euparkeria is very well marked compared to
20
21 that of Proterosuchus, where it appears to be absent (Clark et al. [63]). Anterior to the
22
23 tensor crest, the laterosphenoid extends as a medially directed process, the
24
25 dorsoventral extension of which is about half that of the tensor crest.
26
27 Anterior to the buttress and to the tensor crest, there is a large opening. The
28
29
30 posterior margin of this opening bears one sharp, distinct anterior projection, just
31
32 ventral to the end of the laterosphenoid buttress. On the right hand side, this
33
34 projection does not appear to reach the anterior margin of the opening, but on the left
35
36 hand side it reaches the anterior margin to form a small foramen dorsal to it. Although
37
38
39
visible in the specimen, the complete bar forming the foramen of the left hand side
40
41 could not be segmented out in the 3D model because, despite having a different
42
43 coloration from the matrix, the densities are not easily distinguishable. This bar would
44
45 represent the separation between the foramina of CN III ventrally from CN IV
46
47 dorsally.
48
49
50 The anteroventral borders of the CN III and IV foramina are formed by the
51
52 slender process. Compared to Proterosuchus (NMQR 1484; Clark et al. [63]), the
53
54 slender process of Euparkeria (Figure 15, sp) is wider and would have been more
55
56 posteriorly directed. The anterodorsal border of the slender process seems to be
57
58
59
slightly notched, probably corresponding to the point of exit of CN II (Figure 15B, C,
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 24 of 103

2
3 CN II). No ventral crest that would correspond to that identified in Proterosuchus [63]
4
5 is visible. The lateral surface of the anteriormost region of the laterosphenoid is
6
7 smooth and gently concave. The laterosphenoid tapers dorsoventrally at its

15
16 Inner ear
17
18
19
The inner ear (Figure 16) is very well preserved and when the overall size of
20
21 the braincase is taken into account, it is much enlarged (82.44 mm³) when compared
22
23 to that of Youngina capensis (62.69 mm³ [65]; the only non-saurian diapsid for which
24
25 the inner ear is segmented). The fenestra ovalis (Figure 16A, fo) is well defined and
26
27 dorsoventrally elongate when compared to that of Prolacerta ([47], fig. 1) and laterally
28
29
30 it is formed mostly by the prootic anteriorly and the opisthotic posteriorly, with
31
32 participation of the parabasisphenoid ventrally and anteroventrally (Figure 6C). The
33
34 basioccipital also contributes to the posteroventral part of the medial margin (Figure
35
36 6C). The lagenar crests (Figure 5A, B, lg.cr) are situated on the anterior and posterior
37
38
39
borders of the fenestra ovalis, at about its midheight. The lagenar crests mark the
40
41 dorsalmost limit of the lagenar recess and separate the vestibular and cochlear
42
43 regions of the inner ear (Figure 5A, B, lg.cr). The anterior lagenar crest is low and
44
45 rounded, while the posterior one is more prominent and thinner. The ventralmost tip
46
47 of the lagenar recess appears to lie in the “unossified gap” (sensu Gower & Weber
48
49
50 [43]), with the cochlea having passed medial to the bony bar connecting the ventral
51
52 ramus of the opisthotic and the posterodorsal region of the parabasisphenoid, and
53
54 lateral to the braincase floor (Figure 3D, F). The region connecting the otic capsule
55
56 and the occipital region in Euparkeria is marked by a rounded notch on the medial
57
58
59
side of the ventral ramus of the opisthotic (Figure 3; Figure 16E, F, pf). The
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 25 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 perilymphatic duct passed through this notch, likely through its narrowest part. This
4
5 part is located more laterally in comparison to that of Sphenodon (ROM R9298) and
6
7 the duct ran in a more anteroposterior direction in Euparkeria as opposed to
8
9
10 anterolateral to posteromedial in Sphenodon (see discussion below). The notch as a
11
12 whole is too large to have housed the perilymphatic duct alone. Thus, the
13
14 perilymphatic foramen was only partially laterally surrounded by bone (see
15
16 Opisthotic).
17
18
19
The semicircular canals (Figure 15A–D) are of roughly the same length as one
20
21 another. The posteroventral part of the vestibule is not enclosed by bone, in part
22
23 because of the elongated fenestra ovalis, and medially the internal auditory meatus is
24
25 largely unossified. The anterior semicircular canal exits the anterior ampulla anteriorly
26
27 and slightly laterally (Figure 16, asc), extending immediately dorsally and posteriorly,
28
29
30 and then medially, around the floccular fossa, entering the common crus
31
32 anterodorsally. Only the dorsalmost part of the common crus is surrounded by bone
33
34 (Figure 16E, F, cc), but its ventral connection to the utriculus is marked by a groove
35
36 on the right medial wall of the braincase (Figure 3A, gr.ut), allowing its course to be
37
38
39
reconstructed. The anterior and posterior semicircular canals meet at approximately
40
41 the midlength of the vestibule (Figure 16A, asc, psc), but the common crus enters the
42
43 utriculus just anterior to the dorsal rim of the fenestra ovalis, extending ventrally and
44
45 posteriorly. The posterior semicircular canal leaves the posterior portion of the
46
47 vestibule dorsolaterally and extends anteromedially into the common crus. In dorsal
48
49
50 view (Figure 16D), the paths of the anterior and posterior semicircular canals
51
52 describe arches whose concavities face opposite directions. The lateral semicircular
53
54 canal is a little shorter than the other semicircular canals. It leaves the posterolateral
55
56 portion of the anterior ampulla, describing a gentle arc in dorsal view, and enters the
57
58
59
vestibule laterally (Figure 16D).

3 Like the fenestra ovalis, the metotic foramen (Figures 1F, 5C, D, 7B, 16E, F,
4
5 mf) is also dorsoventrally elongate compared to Youngina [65] (fig. 9 – online
6
7 animated version) and Prolacerta [47] (fig. 1). The lateral border of the metotic
8
9
10 foramen is fairly uniform, but the posterior rim of the ventral part of the medial border
11
12 protrudes, so that the foramen is wider at its medial margin ventrally than dorsally.
13
14 The ventral portion comprises more than half of the foramen. The metotic foramen is
15
16 not subdivided into a fenestra pseudorotunda and a vagus foramen and there is also
17
18
19
no indication of an independent exit for the glossopharyngeal nerve, thus it is certain
20
21 that CN X and CN IX exited the braincase through the metotic foramen. The
22
23 accessory nerve (CN XI) and the vena cephalica posterior could have exited the
24
25 braincase through the metotic foramen, or, alternatively, through the faint,
26
27 anteriormost foramen found on the right exocciptal of SAM-PK-7696 (see above;
28
29
30 Figure 5A, ?CN XI) and through the foramen magnum, respectively. The irregular
31
32 medial shape of the metotic foramen potentially indicates the positions of the
33
34 structures housed by, and exiting through, the foramen: the ventral portion is wide
35
36 and rounded in posterolateral view, and likely represents the area where the
37
38
39
perilymphatic sac sat and bulged into – the area corresponding to the recessus
40
41 scalae tympani in taxa where the fenestra pseudorotunda is present. The
42
43 perilymphatic foramen, which connects this area to the lagenar recess, is only
44
45 ossified laterally, as described above. The nerves and the vein would have left dorsal
46
47 to the perilympahtic sac, where the metotic foramen is narrower medially.
48

50
51
52 Cranial Nerves & Some Vascular Elements
53
54 The optic nerve (CN II) would have entered the braincase anteromedially
55
56 through either a single foramen or through separate foramina for the right and left
57
58
59
nerves. The laterosphenoid of Euparkeria is fairly well preserved, thus the absence of
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 27 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 any medial structure, or indication thereof, seems to indicate that the CN II left the
4
5 braincase through a single medial foramen (Figure 16B, C, CN II), similar to the
6
7 situation in Proterosuchus [63]. The oculomotor (CN III) and trochlear (CN IV) nerves
8
9
10 are closely related motor nerves that may have confluent foramina in some archosaur
11
12 clades [66], with the CN III lying ventral to the CN IV. The nerves in Euparkeria, like in
13
14 Proterosuchus [63], had separate foramina (Figure 16B, C, CNIII, CNIV), but the
15
16 ventrolateral border of the foramen for CN III in Euparkeria seems to have been more
17
18
19
complete than in Proterosuchus. This is indicated by the presence of a small
20
21 projection of the laterosphenoid (Figure 15C) absent in Proterosuchus.
22
23 The trigeminal nerve (CN V) innervates a diverse group of tissues and
24
25 muscles that include the regions of the nose, mouth, facial skin, cornea, teeth, palate,
26
27 and pharynx, among others, and is, therefore, the largest of the cranial nerves [64]. In
28
29
30 Euparkeria, the margin of its foramen is formed by the prootic (Figure 1F, CN V),
31
32 except for the anterodorsal border, which was formed by the laterosphenoid (Figure
33
34 15, CN V). The lateral surface of the prootic bordering the posterior region of the
35
36 foramen is gently depressed, indicating the external position of the Gasserian
37
38
39
ganglion in relation to the brain cavity (Figure 2E, ggf). The ventral and anteroventral
40
41 borders of the trigeminal foramen are formed by the ossification of part of the base of
42
43 the embryonic pila antotica – the anterior inferior process of the prootic (Figure 2E,
44
45 aip).
46
47 As the suture between prootic and parabsisphenoid extends through the
48
49
50 foramina for the abducens nerve (CN VI), the prootic and parabasisphenoid thus form
51
52 the laterodorsal and ventromedial borders of these foramina, respectively (Figure 2A,
53
54 CN VI). The foramina for CN VI are located on the dorsum sellae, near its lateral
55
56 margin at about its midheight. The lateral borders of the foramina are partially
57
58
59
concealed in anterior view by the clinoid processes of the parabasisphenoid.

3 On the right hand side of SAM-PK-7696 the foramen for the facial nerve (CN
4
5 VII) is largely concealed by crest 1 of the prootic (Figure 1E, cr1). On the left hand
6
7 side, crest 1 does not obscure the foramen (there appears to have been post-mortem
8
9
10 distortion on the right hand side) but the foramen sits in a groove formed by crest 1
11
12 anteriorly (Figure 1F, CN VII; also seen on SAM-PK-5867 – Figure 9C). This groove
13
14 extends dorsally and ventrally, marking the routes of the hyomandibular (Figure 2E,
15
16 CN VIIhym) and palatine (Figures 2E, 11C, CN VIIpal) branches of CN VII, respectively.
17
18
19
As described above, the hyomandibular branch of the facial nerve would have left the
20
21 braincase from the posterodorsal part of the foramen, and continued posterodorsally
22
23 towards the base of the paroccipital process, whereas the palatine branch would
24
25 have exited the ventral part of the foramen, and extended ventrally and then medially
26
27 along the posterior margin of the basipterygoid process [47, 54–56].
28
29
30 As the medial wall of the otic capsule is mostly unossified, there are no
31
32 foramina for the branches of the auditory nerve (CN VIII). The glossopharyngeal (CN
33
34 IX), vagus (CN X), and likely also the accessory (CN XI) nerves exited the braincase
35
36 through the metotic foramen (Figures 1E, F; 3A, F; 6; 7B; 11A, B; 12B, mf). The
37
38
39
presence of a shallow recess that closely resembles a foramen on the right hand side
40
41 of SAM-PK-7696 may indicate a separate and independent route for the CN XI
42
43 (Figure 5A, ?CN XI). The dorsal portion of the metotic foramen is somewhat narrower
44
45 than its ventral portion, and the cranial nerves would have left the brain cavity
46
47 through the former, while the perilymphatic sac would have been sited on the latter.
48
49
50 In squamates, the anterior branch of the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) has
51
52 smaller fibres and innervates the tongue, whereas the posterior branch is
53
54 morphologically very similar to the first and second spinal nerves [55, 67]. The
55
56 hypoglossal nerve may leave the braincase as a single ramus, in which case the
57
58
59
exoccipital is pierced by only one foramen. However, the presence of two
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 29 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 independent foramina (Figure 6A, CN XIIa, CN XIIp) indicates that the divergence
4
5 between the branches took place before the CN XII exited the braincase in
6
7 Euparkeria.
8
9
10 Foramina for the ethmoidal and ophthalmic arteries were found in
11
12 Proterosuchus [63], but no similar structures could be identified in Euparkeria,
13
14 possibly due to the poorer preservation of the laterosphenoid. The vidian canals are
15
16 preserved in all specimens of Euparkeria except SAM-PK-7696. The canals are not
17
18
19
well preserved in any of the specimens although it is possible to verify that they make
20
21 a simple connection with the hypophyseal fossa, perforating the basisphenoid
22
23 ventrally (Figure 11A, 12F, ica), posteromedial to the bases of the basipterygoid
24
25 processes, and extending anterodorsally into the fossa. The vena capitis dorsalis
26
27 exited the brain cavity through a foramen located between the prootic, supraoccipital,
28
29
30 parietal, and laterosphenoid (Figure 1A, C, 3A, 5B, D, 11B, vcd).

33
34 DISCUSSION
35
36 In the light of the new data provided by CT scanning, and re-examination of all
37
38
39
available material of Euparkeria, it is now possible to clarify a number of points of
40
41 uncertainty remaining from previous studies regarding the braincase anatomy of
42
43 Euparkeria. We thus address these points, roughly in the morphological order of
44
45 description used above, in the discussion. Additionally, we examine and discuss
46
47 Euparkeria in the broader context of diapsid braincase evolution, with our
48
49
50 understanding again facilitated by the new data available to us. Furthermore, we
51
52 suggest new directions for future studies of archosauriform and diapsid evolution.

3 Basioccipital – The basioccipital of Euparkeria was described by Gower &
4
5 Weber [43] as contributing to the basal tubera with “relatively long and slender” ([43],
6
7 p.373) projecting tongues of bone in comparison to “other earliest archosaurs” ([43],
8
9
10 p.373). Examination of SAM-PK-5867 (Figures 7B, 11A), however, shows that whilst
11
12 the occiput of Euparkeria is overall more gracile than those of other crownward
13
14 archosauriforms, the basal tubera nonetheless have similar proportions to that of, for
15
16 instance, Xilousuchus sapingensis [51]. The basal tubera of Xilousuchus were
17
18
19
described as similar to those of Garjainia prima and Fugusuchus hejiapensis, which,
20
21 in turn, were considered “small, simple and ventrally projecting” ([51], p.884) and
22
23 “broad, flat, and simple” ([51], p.889) ventral projections respectively. Nesbitt [29]
24
25 introduced a new character describing the nature of the anteroposterior thickness of
26
27 the basioccipital portions of the basal tubera (character 106), in which non-
28
29
30 pseudosuchian archosauriforms including Euparkeria show basal tubera which are
31
32 “rounded and anteroposteriorly elongated” ([29], p. 89; state 0, contrasting with the
33
34 “bladelike and anteroposteriorly shortened” basal tubera of some crocodile-line taxa).
35
36 We agree with the scoring of Nesbitt [29] and find that the basal tubera of Euparkeria
37
38
39
cannot be described as exceptionally long and slender among stem and early
40
41 archosarus either in lateral or posterior view.
42
43
44
45 Parabasisphenoid – Welman [48] labelled the cerebral branch of the internal
46
47 carotid artery as extending into the parabasisphenoid through foramina located in the
48
49
50 semilunar depression. As indicated in the previous section, the entrance foramina of
51
52 the artery are located on the ventral surface of the bone, posteromedial to the base
53
54 of the basipterygoid processes (Figures 11A, 14F, ica). This is in agreement with the
55
56 scoring of character 95 of Euparkeria in Nesbitt [29]. Welman [48] also stated that the
57
58
59
basipterygoid processes of Euparkeria are more similar in shape to those of
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 31 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 palaeognath birds than to those of dinosauromorphs and pseudosuchians. We found
4
5 it difficult to assess this statement as little explanation of exactly what is regarded as
6
7 similar is provided. However, the basipterygoid processes of Euparkeria have little
8
9
10 particular resemblance with those of palaeognath birds. The processes of Struthio
11
12 camelus (ZMB 2000 2769), with which Welman [48] made extensive comparisons,
13
14 are short and laterally orientated (Figure 20A, bt). They are highly pneumatic and
15
16 anteroposteriorly elongated in cross section, with the long axis directed slightly
17
18
19
ventrally. This general morphology is in fact quite similar to that of Sphenosuchus
20
21 acutus [68], while the processes of Coelophysis bauri [29] are also small and
22
23 anteroposteriorly elongate, but ventrally orientated and with their long axes dorsally
24
25 directed.
26
27 The route of the suture line between the prootic and parabasisphenoid
28
29
30 described above contrasts with that described by Cruickshank [46], who indicated
31
32 that the parabasisphenoid formed part of the posterior margin of the fenestra ovalis
33
34 (a “small posteriormost process in front of the ventral ramus of the opisthotic” – [46],
35
36 p. 684) and a large part of its anterior margin. The suture between the prootic and the
37
38
39
parabasisphenoid was identified in the CT scans as extending directly
40
41 posterodorsally to anteroventrally from the anteroventral margin of the fenestra ovalis
42
43 (Figures 3E, 6C). However, the basisphenoid does have a small dorsal process
44
45 laterally that forms the anteroventral border of the fenestra ovalis (Figure 2E, dp.bs).
46
47 The suture identified by Cruickshank [46] is in fact the groove for the palatal branch
48
49
50 of CN VII, and the “posteriormost process” indicated by Cruickshank is absent. Ewer
51
52 [15] indicated the parabasisphenoid-prootic suture line broadly correctly, with the
53
54 parabasisphenoid ascending dorsally as a short posterior process anterior to the
55
56 fenestra ovalis, then descending again along the groove for CN VII. Gower & Weber
57
58
59
[43] excluded the dorsal process of the parabasisphenoid that contributes to the
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 32 of 103
1
2
3 fenestra ovalis from that element entirely, indicating the prootic-parabasisphenoid
4
5 suture line as extending anteroposteriorly; the posterior portion of the line indicated
6
7 by Gower & Weber [43] is likely a crack, with the fragment of bone immediately
8
9
10 dorsal to this crack also being part of the parabasisphenoid; it is also possible to
11
12 identify the ascending process of the parabasisphenoid on the left side of SAM-PK-
13
14 5867. A tall posterior ascending process of the parabasisphenoid was depicted by
15
16 Dzik [69] in the braincase of Silesaurus. Upon examination of the relevant
17
18
19
specimens, however, it is difficult to verify exactly the contribution of the
20
21 parabasisphenoid to the fenestra ovalis. On the right hand side of ZPAL Ab III/364 the
22
23 process seems robust and tall, but on the left side it is was not found. There are no
24
25 signs of processes on a second Silesaurus specimen, ZPAL Ab III/361. Stagonolepis
26
27 olenkae (ZPAL AbIII/466/17, right hand side) also shows the parabasisphenoid
28
29
30 participating in the anteroventral border of the fenestra ovalis, but the prootic-
31
32 parabasisphenoid suture is difficult to follow anterior to this and an ascending
33
34 process may have been absent.
35
36 We confirm the statement of Gower & Weber [43] that the lateral depression is
37
38
39
formed entirely by the parabasisphenoid (Figure 3E) and there is no participation of
40
41 another element, such as the alaparasphenoid [48] or the prootic [47]. We also
42
43 confirm that the lateral depression is not connected to any cavity within the
44
45 parabasisphenoid itself or within the basioccipital. This is confirmed not only upon
46
47 examination of SAM-PK-7696, but also of SAM-PK-5867 and UMZC T.692, and is
48
49
50 thus not a result, as suggested by Gower & Weber [43], of individual variation.
51
52 However, the braincase as a whole is lightly constructed; whilst this is exaggerated to
53
54 some extent in SAM-PK-7696 due to acid preparation, the entire braincase is formed
55
56 of trabeculate bone. In UMZC T692 and SAM-PK-6047A, the preserved parts of the
57
58
59
basipterygoid processes appear hollow in the CT scans; this may be either because
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 33 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 the delicate trabeculae were damaged or because the scan made was not sensitive
4
5 enough to detect them. We were not able to locate any foramen or channel
6
7 connecting these or other internal spaces to the outside (see below). With the
8
9
10 reevaluation of the dorsal extent of the parabasisphenoid and its subsequent
11
12 contribution to the anterior part of the lateral braincase wall, our perception of the
13
14 roles of the parabsisphenoid and prootic is also altered and is discussed below.
15
16 Other aspects of the lateral depression and of potentially pneumatic features, such as
17
18
19
its homologous nature with the anterior tympanic recess, will also be discussed
20
21 below.
22
23 Scans of SAM-PK-5867 and of the Cambridge specimen UMZC T.692 confirm
24
25 the conclusions of Gower & Weber [43] that Euparkeria possesses no intertuberal
26
27 plate, contrary to Nesbitt [29], who scores the intertuberal plate as present and
28
29
30 arched anteriorly. The anterior border of the medial pharyngeal recess of Euparkeria
31
32 is, however arched, and we thus suppose Nesbitt [29] must have mistaken this
33
34 border for an intertuberal plate; the intertuberal plate of some taxa, e.g.
35
36 Arizonasaurus (see [70]), is indeed both present and arched anteriorly, but the
37
38
39
distribution of this morphology is much more restricted than indicated by Nesbitt [29].
40
41
42
43 Exoccipital – Gower & Weber [43] tentatively described the exoccipitals as not
44
45 contacting medially. This was reconsidered in Gower [57], and based on the scoring
46
47 of this character for Euparkeria, Nesbitt [29] (p. 91) stated that “[p]lesiomorphically
48
49
50 among archosauriforms, the exoccipitals meet along the midline preventing the
51
52 basioccipital from participating in the endocranial cavity”, also scoring Euparkeria as
53
54 having contacting exoccipitals. By tracing the suture lines in CT data we can confirm
55
56 that the exoccipitals did not meet at the midline in SAM-PK-7696, with the ventral
57
58
59
border of the foramen magnum thus formed by the basioccipital (Figure 6A). In SAM-
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 34 of 103
1
2
3 PK-5867, the exoccipitals also do not meet, but they approach each other more than
4
5 in SAM-PK-7696 (Figure 7B), and we consider this to be the result of the lateral
6
7 compression suffered by the specimen. In UMZC T.692, however, the right exoccipital
8
9
10 extends further medially than in SAM-PK-5867 and almost reaches the midline
11
12 (Figure 15B), but does not contact its antimere. We can also confirm that there are
13
14 two foramina for CN XII in both SAM-PK-7696 and SAM-PK-5867, with a third
15
16 foramen in the region of SAM-PK-7696 potentially attributable to CN XI (Figure 5A).
17
18
19
We agree with Gower & Weber [43] that CN X would have left the braincase via the
20
21 metotic foramen as in all modern amniotes without a proper vagus foramen, contra
22
23 Ewer [15], who identified the upper portion of the CN XII foramina as being for CN X.
24
25
26
27 Opisthotic – The suture between opisthotic and exoccipital was identified with
28
29
30 the assistance of CT scans (Figure 6A), and it can be confirmed that the exoccipital is
31
32 restricted to the pillar between the metotic foramen and the foramen magnum, not
33
34 participating in the paroccipital process. We can confirm that Cruickshank [46] and
35
36 Welman [48] were correct in their identification of a delicate bony bridge connecting
37
38
39
the distal end of the ventral ramus of the opisthotic and the parabasisphenoid on the
40
41 right hand side of SAM-PK-7696 (Figures 3D, 11B, bd.bn). We also identify this
42
43 feature on the right hand side in SAM-PK-5867 (Figure 9B, bd.bn). Damage prevents
44
45 its identification on the left hand side in both specimens and in UMZC T.692 (see
46
47 below).
48
49
50
51
52 Prootic – Gower & Sennikov [51] reported a small ridge on the anterior inferior
53
54 process of the prootic of Euparkeria, but further examination of UMZC T.692 led
55
56 Gower & Weber [43] to reidentify it as a preservational artifact and to consider the
57
58
59
ridge absent in Euparkeria. The absence of such a ridge was also identified by
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 35 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 Nesbitt [29] as a synapormorphy of Archosauria (character 94). We confirm however
4
5 that the ridge is indeed present in Euparkeria in SAM-PK-7696 (Figure 2F, ri) and on
6
7 the left hand side of SAM-PK-5867 (although poorly preserved; damage prevents
8
9
10 accurate assessment in UMZC T.692 and in SAM-PK-6047A the prootic is not
11
12 preserved) and marks the ventral edge of the depression for the Gasserian ganglion.
13
14 Such a ridge also forms part of the raised border of the depression for the Gasserian
15
16 ganglion in other archosauriforms (e.g. Trilophosaurus buettneri [71]) and in most
17
18
19
achosaur taxa where the entire border of the trigeminal foramen is well known, e.g.
20
21 Dysalotosaurus lettowvorbecki [56], Stagonolepis olenkae (ZPAL AbIII/466/17) and
22
23 Adeopapposaurus mognai (PVSJ 568). We also disagree that this feature is absent
24
25 in Erythrosuchus africanus (BP/1/3893; contra [29, 62]), although the ridge is much
26
27 less prominent than in crown taxa. The phylogenetic informativeness of this feature is
28
29
30 thus, in our opinion, doubtful.
31
32 Two separate foramina for the palatine and hyomandibular branches of the
33
34 facial nerve were identified first by Ewer [15], and this was followed by Cruickshank
35
36 [46]. We agree with Gower and Weber [43] that only one foramen is present in UMZC
37
38
39
T.692, and could also identify only one opening for CN VII in SAM-PK-7696 (Figure
40
41 1E, F; 3B, E) and on the left hand side of SAM-PK-5867 (the right hand side is too
42
43 damaged for assessment). As correctly noted by Gower & Weber [43], the area
44
45 identified as housing the palatine foramen by Ewer [15] and Cruickshank [46] is
46
47 simply a blind depressed area on the lateral surface of the parabasisphenoid.
48
49
50 Separate foramina for the hyomandibular and palatine branches of the facial nerve
51
52 are not found with certainty in any taxa outside Theropoda, and it appears safe to
53
54 state that such a separation did not occur until much later in archosaurian
55
56 evolutionary history, and that there is no individual variation in Euparkeria (contra the
57
58
59
suggestion of Gower & Weber [43]).

4
5 Supraoccipital – Gower & Weber [43] (p.379) stated that “[i]f the medial suture
6
7 between the prootic and supraoccipital has been correctly identified, then the
8
9
10 posterodorsal end of the floccular recess just extends onto the supraoccipital on the
11
12 left of UMZC T.692, and the broken surface exposed above the recess on the right
13
14 side represents the prootic surface for articulation with the supraoccipital”. We
15
16 disagree that the floccular fossa extends onto the supraoccipital, but we agree that
17
18
19
the suture between prootic and supraoccipital should extend just dorsal to the recess.
20
21 We also find it difficult to understand how, if the floccular fossa extends dorsally onto
22
23 the supraoccipital, the articular surface of the prootic would be exposed dorsal to the
24
25 recess. Gower & Weber [43] also state that “[a] shallow groove on the left side
26
27 immediately anterior to the floccular recess (Figure 9) is interpreted as indicating the
28
29
30 probable path of the middle cerebral vein.” What we identify as the hollow for the
31
32 transverse sinus, more than the middle cerebral vein itself (see above), is not
33
34 preserved in UMZC T.692. The area indicated by Gower & Weber [43] instead
35
36 corresponds to the anterior part of the subarcuate fossa which has been
37
38
39
anteroposteriorly compressed, creating the appearance of a shallow groove.
40
41 Welman [48] identified an epiotic bone anterior to the dorsal part of the base of
42
43 the paroccipital processes in both in SAM-PK-5867 and SAM-PK-7696, though only
44
45 indicated the suture between it and the opisthotic and prootic in the latter. We can
46
47 find no evidence for a separate ossification in this region both using CT data and on
48
49
50 reexamination of the specimens. The anterolateral margins of the supraoccipital in
51
52 SAM-PK-5867 appear to be more rounded and extended than in SAM-PK-7696, and
53
54 this could be potentially indicative of an ossification separate from the supraoccipital
55
56 in this position that is absent in SAM-PK-7696. However, we can find no sutural
57
58
59
distinction between these areas of the skull roof and the rest of the supraoccipital in
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 37 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 SAM-PK-5867, and these differences in shape may be more readily explained by
4
5 mediolateral compression and the articulation with the interparietal and parietal in
6
7 SAM-PK-5867. We thus find no good evidence for the existence of a separate epiotic
8
9
10 in Euparkeria capensis.
11
12
13
14 Fenestra Ovalis and Metotic Foramen – Welman [48] used the size of the
15
16 fenestra ovalis as a synapormorphy uniting Euparkeria and birds with the exclusion of
17
18
19
dinosaurs. We agree with Gower & Weber [43] that, without quantification of “large”
20
21 or “small”, it is difficult to compare the state in Euparkeria with that in other taxa. Taxa
22
23 on both the archosaur stem – e.g. Mesosuchus browni (SAM-PK-6536) – and on the
24
25 crocodile line – e.g. Stagonolepis olenkae (ZPAL AbIII/466/17) - show a fenestra
26
27 ovalis just as extensive as that of Euparkeria, and we find Welman’s [48] conclusions
28
29
30 thus doubtful. We also agree with Gower & Weber [43] that there is no fenestra
31
32 pseudorotunda, rather only an unsubdivided metotic foramen. There is thus no
33
34 metotic strut – the structure which would subdivide the foramen [43, 52], formed from
35
36 the metotic cartilage and separating CN IX from CN X [73]. Although neither feature
37
38
39
is present in Euparkeria, we also wish to point out that the metotic strut is a distinct
40
41 feature from the lateral ridge of the exoccipital (which separates CN XIIa from CN
42
43 XIIp), contra Nesbitt [29].
44
45 Character 114 of Nesbitt [29] synonymizes the lateral ridge of the exoccipital of
46
47 Gower [57] with the metotic strut of theropods. There is, however, a misuse of the
48
49
50 term “metotic strut” here. The term seems to have been introduced in fossil avialan
51
52 literature by Witmer [72] to refer to the ossification of the metotic cartilage, a structure
53
54 related to the formation of the recessus scala tympani and located between the
55
56 nerves glossopharyngeal (CN IX) and vagus (CN X) [73]. Since the lateral ridge of
57
58
59
the exoccipital is, in turn, related to the anterior and posterior branches of the
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 38 of 103
1
2
3 hypoglossal (CN XII) nerve, these structures cannot possibly be related. It is out of
4
5 the scope of this work to find out where and in which context this misunderstanding
6
7 came to being, just as it is not our intention to infer whether or not a lateral ridge on
8
9
10 the exoccipital of pseudosuchians and a lateral ridge on the exoccipital that is called
11
12 metotic strut in theropods are homologous. We simply point out the potential for
13
14 confusion regarding this term. Gower [57] was very aware of the developmental
15
16 context in which the term “metotic strut” was coined and used, for it had been part of
17
18
19
the base of the argument of Gower & Weber [43] (section 3a-V ) for the absence of a
20
21 fenestra pseudorotunda in Euparkeria.
22
23
24
25 Inner Ear – We are also able to shed clarity on several aspects of the anatomy
26
27 of the inner ear. Gower & Weber [43] (p. 389) states that “there is no clearly ossified
28
29
30 differentiation between the canalicular and cochlear parts of the inner ear” in UMZC
31
32 T.692, but we do find a lagenar crest to be present in SAM-PK-7696 (Figure 5A, B).
33
34 However, we agree with Gower & Weber [43] that evidence regarding shape of the
35
36 cochlea is inconclusive. The otic capsule of diapsids is not extensively ossified as in
37
38
39
mammals [74], and thus the exact shape and length of the cochlea cannot be
40
41 indirectly assessed by the osteology alone, and Euparkeria is no exception. We also
42
43 agree with Gower & Weber [43] (p.389) that “part of the anteroventral limit of the
44
45 vestibule can be detected in Euparkeria as a subhorizontal ridge in UMZC T.692, on
46
47 the medial surface of the braincase immediately above the facial foramen”. The
48
49
50 lagenar recess is formed equally by the basioccipital and the basisphenoid medially,
51
52 and thus differs from the description of Welman [48]. Gower & Weber [43] were
53
54 unsure if the unossified gap would indicate the ventralmost part of the lagenar
55
56 recess, but, as we can confirm that it does (see below), the orientation of the cochlea
57
58
59
can be more precisely reconstructed based on the lagenar crests and the unossified
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 39 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 gap as being straight ventral. Nesbitt [29 (character 118) identified Euparkeria as
4
5 having no well-defined lagenar recess. This is however based on Gower [57], which
6
7 is, in turn based on the reluctance of Gower & Weber [43] to identify the unossified
8
9
10 gap as part of the lagenar recess.
11
12 A strong notch on the right medial wall of the opisthotic of SAM-PK-7696 is
13
14 likely an artefact. The surfaces of the ventral ramus of the opisthotic around this
15
16 notch are damaged on both sides, and CT scans show that disarticulated fragments
17
18
19
of bone are attached to them with what appears to be glue (Figure 16E, F). However,
20
21 the ventralmost portion of the medial surface of the ramus does seem to bear a
22
23 gently rounded broad notch, and a similar structure was found on the left hand side
24
25 of SAM-PK-5867. This leads to the conclusion that the lateral border of the
26
27 perilymphatic foramen is identifiable, but it is more ventrally located than the original
28
29
30 area pointed by Gower & Weber [43]. There is definitely no bony medial border,
31
32 similar to the condition in Sphenodon (ROM R9298 – Figure 20). However, several
33
34 differences appear when the structures of Euparkeria and Sphenodon are compared.
35
36 First, the perilymphatic foramen in Euparkeria would be more laterally located.
37
38
39
Second, the dorsal and ventral borders of the foramen in Euparkeria are less
40
41 ossified, while the medial extension of the ramus in Sphenodon is greater. Also, the
42
43 axis of the ventral ramus is slightly twisted in Sphenodon, so that the duct would have
44
45 extended in an anterolateral to posteromedial direction, whereas in Euparkeria it is
46
47 straighter, and the duct extends anteroposteriorly. Finally, in Sphenodon, the ventral
48
49
50 half of the perilymphatic foramen is formed by the basioccipital, while in Euparkeria it
51
52 is formed by the opisthotic. Thus, the position of the perilymphatic foramen identified
53
54 here agrees with the assumption of Gower & Weber [43] that a notch on the medial
55
56 surface of the ventral ramus of the opisthotic represents the lateral half of an
57
58
59
incompletely ossified foramen.

5 Unossified Gap – The open area between the ventralmost tip of the ventral
6
7 ramus of the opisthotic, the anterodorsal part of the basioccipital, and the
8
9
10 posterodorsal region of the parabasisphenoid was identified by Cruickshank [46] as
11
12 the lagenar recess and by Welman [48] as the fenestra pseudorotunda. Gower &
13
14 Weber [43] termed this structure as an “unossified gap” and homologised it with
15
16 similarly positioned unossified gaps of Sphenodon and other diapsids. Gower &
17
18
19
Weber [43] corrected Welman’s [48] interpretation of the presence of a fenestra
20
21 pseudorotunda, since this structure relates to the bony subdivision of the metotic
22
23 foramen and the formation of a true recessus scala tympani. The metotic foramen of
24
25 Euparkeria is not subdivided, and thus no fenestra pseudorotunda is present.
26
27 Although Gower & Weber [43] indicated that this unossified gap could
28
29
30 represent part of the lagenar recess, there remained some uncertainty. The specimen
31
32 UMCZ T.692 provides only a medial and a damaged lateral view of the braincase,
33
34 and Gower & Weber [43] had only a cast of SAM-PK-7696 and the work of
35
36 Cruickshank [46] at their disposal. With CT scans of SAM-PK-7696 and of SAM-PK-
37
38
39
5867 at hand, in the light of the growing literature on braincase and neuroanatomy of
40
41 fossil archosaurs [56, 60, 75] and based on comparisons to extant lepidosaurs [55],
42
43 we confirm that this space represents the ventralmost part of the lagenar recess.
44
45 We are also able to confirm that the bony bridge separating the aperture of the
46
47 gap from the margin of the fenestra ovalis is mostly formed by a thin, but marked
48
49
50 posterolateral process of the basisphenoid (Figure 3D, F). What unfortunately
51
52 remains unclear is whether there is a minor anterior contribution of the opisthotic. On
53
54 the right side of SAM-PK-7696, the cortex of the anterior surface of the distal part of
55
56 the ventral ramus of the opisthotic seems to have been worn away during preparation
57
58
59
(Figure 1F), together with the medial border of the unossified gap formed by
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 41 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 basioccipital and basisphenoid, whereas on the left side this structure is not
4
5 preserved. The left side of SAM-PK-5867 is severely damaged and on the right side
6
7 only the posterolateral process of the basisphenoid remains. If the opisthotic
8
9
10 contributed to this bridge, then it was probably just a small eminence for the
11
12 articulation with the basisphenoid.
13
14
15
16 Semilunar Depression – On the right hand side of SAM-PK-7696, immediately
17
18
19
anterior to the unossified gap there is a clear depression on the lateral surface of the
20
21 parabasisphenoid contribution to the basal tuber (Figure 1E). The posterodorsal
22
23 border of this depression is open. The anteroventral border is delimited by a crest of
24
25 bone of the parabasisphenoid on the proximal end of the basal tuber. This structure
26
27 was identified as the semilunar depression by Gower & Weber [43]. The term was
28
29
30 introduced by Evans [47] (p.186) for a similar feature in Prolacerta and Mesosuchus
31
32 and subsequently identified in other archosauriforms [51, 62, 61]. Evans [47] (fig. 7)
33
34 illustrated the abovementioned feature in SAM-PK-7696, but did not label it. We are
35
36 not able to locate this structure with certainty in SAM-PK-5867 because the basal
37
38
39
tubera of the parabasisphenoid are damaged. The form of the semilunar depression
40
41 in SAM-PK-7696 differs notably from other taxa, being much more pronounced and
42
43 more dorsally, as opposed to laterally, open than in Prolacerta (BPI 1 2675),
44
45 Proterosuchus alexanderi (NMQR 880), Osmolskina (ZPAL RV/413 and ZPAL
46
47 RV/424) and Dorosuchus (PIN 1579/62), but this may be exaggerated by loss of the
48
49
50 posteroventralmost part in this specimen.
51
52 Of the putative functions suggested for this structure, the function as an
53
54 articular facet for the ventral ramus of the opisthotic can probably be excluded as in
55
56 articulated specimens of both Euparkeria (SAM-PK-7696) and Proterosuchus goweri
57
58
59
(NMQR 880) the semilunar depression is exposed. Furthermore, in Prolacerta (BPI 1
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 42 of 103
1
2
3 2675) the ventral ramus is somewhat bent at its mid-portion, so that the distalmost
4
5 part is clearly ventrally directed and could not have articulated with the semilunar
6
7 depresion. Likewise, Evans [47] (fig. 7) illustrated the ventral ramus of Euparkeria as
8
9
10 anteroventrally directed towards the semilunar depression, but this is inaccurate. The
11
12 ventral ramus of the opisthotic is only slightly anteriorly directed and bends very
13
14 gently, extending ventrally until its distal tip (Figure 5A); no articulation with the
15
16 semilunar depression is present. The alternative functional suggestion of Evans [47]
17
18
19
for the semilunar depression is to serve as a “line of attachment for connective tissue
20
21 filling in the lower part of the overlying fenestra ovalis”. Considering this and the
22
23 definition of Gower & Weber [43] that a “lateral opening between opisthotic,
24
25 parabasisphenoid and basioccipital […] represents an unossified area […] that would
26
27 probably have been covered by cartilage in life”, then it would make the semilunar
28
29
30 depression of Evans [47] the anteroventral part of the unossified gap of Gower &
31
32 Weber [43] – or the parabasisphenoid contribution to the unossified gap. However, a
33
34 similar depression appears to be absent in crown archosaurs, non-archosauriform
35
36 archosauromorphs, and Sphenodon (ROM R9298 – Figure 20C, D), although an
37
38
39
unossified gap is often present. With the absence of a homologue in extant taxa we
40
41 cannot be certain as to the function of the semilunar depression.
42
43
44
45 Pneumatisation – No true pneumatic cavity was found in the sense of an
46
47 internal space within a bone connected through a foramen to other external spaces
48
49
50 such as the middle ear cavity or the pharyngeal sinus. However, CT scanning
51
52 revealed trabeculate, rather than compact, bone histology in the braincases of
53
54 Euparkeria. The pneumatic system often includes shallow recesses that do not
55
56 necessarily perforate adjacent bones (hereafter termed pneumatic sinuses), and in
57
58
59
the case of Euparkeria these may include the ventral median pharyngeal recess
60

2
3 (Figures 1D, 7B, 11A, 12F, 14B, D, mpr) and the lateral depression of the
4
5 parabasisphenoid (Figures 2E, F, 3E, 5A, B, 9A, 14E, ld). The median pharyngeal
6
7 recess (basisphenoid recess of Witmer & Ridgely [76]) is present in a number of non-
8
9
10 archosauriform reptiles such as Captorhinus laticeps [54], Youngina [65], and
11
12 Prolacerta [47], whereas the lateral depression is probably homologous with the
13
14 anterior tympanic recess of theropods and birds (see below; sensu Witmer & Ridgley
15
16 [76]), but unlike in coelurosaurs [76], it shows no pneumatisation of the surrounding
17
18
19
bones. Nesbitt [29] scored a median pharyngeal recess as absent in Euparkeria
20
21 (character 107), but his definition of this structure seems to correspond to a
22
23 pronounced depression at the anterior extreme of the ventral fossa at the midline.
24
25 Such a depression is indeed absent in Euparkeria, although appears to also be
26
27 absent in some of the taxa where this is scored as present by Nesbitt [29] (e.g.
28
29
30 Turfanosuchus dabanensis – see [77]). We would advocate using a different
31
32 nomenclature (e.g. pronounced midline fossa at anterior of median pharyngeal
33
34 recess) to describe this more pronounced recess to avoid confusion with the more
35
36 broadly applicable “median pharyngeal recess”.
37
38
39
Gower & Weber [43] described the deep lateral depression of the
40
41 parabasisphenoid as not being homologous with the anterior tympanic recess (ATR)
42
43 of birds (contra [48]), and Nesbitt [29] restricted the presence of a true anterior
44
45 tympanic recess to dinosauromorphs (character 101). However, whilst no pneumatic
46
47 sinuses leading from the lateral depression can be identified, we find that the lateral
48
49
50 depression in Euparkeria corresponds topologically to the ATR of dinosaurs and
51
52 birds. In dinosaurs and birds, the ATR arises in the region of the internal carotid
53
54 foramen, between the alaparasphenoid and the basisphenoid. The facial nerve exits
55
56 the braincase within or just posterior to the ATR and its palatine branch traverses the
57
58
59
recess [72, 76]. Similarly, the ATR of Euparkeria is located on the lateral surface of
60

1
2
3 the parabasisphenoid, posterodorsal to the basipterygoid process and just ventral to
4
5 the exit of the CN VII, and the palatine branch of the nerve also crosses the area. In
6
7 Euparkeria, the internal carotid artery does not enter the parabasisphenoid in the
8
9
10 ATR area, but in taxa where the internal carotid artery pierces the bone laterally
11
12 instead of ventrally it does so in this same region (e.g. [78] – see below). The ATR
13
14 identified in Silesaurus lacks pneumatic sinuses [29, 69], but is still classed as an
15
16 ATR [69] and is extremely similar both in terms of morphology and topology to the
17
18
19
lateral depression of Euparkeria. It is also located on the lateral surface of the
20
21 parabasisphenoid, posterodorsal to the basipterygoid process and ventral to the
22
23 foramen of the CN VII and on the course of its palatine branch.
24
25 We feel that the only meaningful distinction to be made between the ATR and
26
27 the lateral depression is whether pneumatic pneumatic sinuses are present leading
28
29
30 off into the braincase wall from the depression. Following this distinction, both
31
32 Silesaurus and Euparkeria would have a lateral depression whilst some dinosaurs
33
34 would show an ATR. A more straightforward way of describing this difference,
35
36 reflecting better the homology of these structures, may be an ATR lacking pneumatic
37
38
39
sinuses versus one showing pneumatic sinuses. Whilst we understand that caution is
40
41 warranted in homologizing pneumatic structures (see [72]), we do not see justification
42
43 for homologizing the recess of Silesaurus (and other taxa lacking pneumatic
44
45 pneumatic sinuses, e.g. Lewisuchus [79]) with that of dinosaurs if that of Euparkeria
46
47 is not homologized similarly. We would advocate two separate homology statements:
48
49
50 one homologizing the recess of Euparkeria, dinosaurs, and Silesaurus based on its
51
52 topological correspondence, and a second homologizing the presence of pneumatic
53
54 pneumatic sinuses (i.e. the condition seen in theropods). We also note that a very
55
56 similar structure, which we would homologize with the lateral depression of
57
58
59
Euparkeria, is present in some non-crocodylomorph pseudosuchians (e.g.

4
5 inexpectatus [81], Lehane [82]; Postosuchus [83]), and thus presence of a lateral
6
7 depression (=anterior tympanic recess) does not necessarily support
8
9
10 avemetatarsalian affinities for Euparkeria.
11
12
13
14 Laterosphenoid – The presence or absence of an ossified element forming the
15
16 anterior braincase wall of stem archosauriforms was a topic of some uncertainty until
17
18
19
the presence of such ossifications was demonstrated in Euparkeria and
20
21 Proterosuchus alexanderi by Clark et al. [63]. However, at the time of that publication,
22
23 further preparation to reveal the laterosphenoids of the holotype of Euparkeria was
24
25 not complete, and an apparent disarticulated laterosphenoid in SAM-PK-7696 was
26
27 relied upon to describe the element. On inspection of SAM-PK-7696 we find it difficult
28
29
30 both to confirm the identification of the element as a laterosphenoid and to identify
31
32 morphological features thereof with certainty. Examination of the laterosphenoids of
33
34 SAM-PK-5867 and UMZC T.692 provides confirmation of the morphology of this
35
36 element in specimens where there is no doubt regarding the identification as a
37
38
39
laterosphenoid.
40
41 The first usage of the term “laterosphenoid” was to refer to the anteriormost
42
43 ossification of the braincase of crocodilians [63], but subsequent usage of the term
44
45 included a non-homologous ossification in snakes, a partially homologous ossification
46
47 in non-ophidian lepidosaurs, and a probably homologous structure in birds. In fact,
48
49
50 the developmental definition of a laterosphenoid was based on the embryology of
51
52 non-ophidian lepidosaurs, a group in which this element seldomly ossifies [84].
53
54 According to this, the laterosphenoid represents the ossification of part of the
55
56 embryonic pila antotica (Figure 18), a cartilaginous structure located between the
57
58
59
exits of CN III and CN IV anteriorly and of the CN V posteriorly [85, 84, 86]. In
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 46 of 103
1
2
3 addition to the laterosphenoid, another element may ossify (or just calcify) in the
4
5 anterior braincase wall of non-ophidian lepidosaurs: the orbitosphenoid. The
6
7 orbitosphenoid is formed by the ossification of the pila metoptica (which forms the
8
9
10 anteriormost part of the embryonic braincase, between CN II anteriorly and CN III
11
12 and IV posteriorly) with some contribution from the taenia medialis – which connects
13
14 the pila metoptica to the structure supporting the olfactory bulb, the planum
15
16 supraseptale [84] (Figure 18). In contrast, the laterosphenoid of crocodilians does not
17
18
19
quite conform to this definition. It is composed of the pila antotica, the pila metoptica,
20
21 and part of the taenia medialis [84, 87]. If preference is given to the first usage, the
22
23 laterosphenoid and orbitosphenoid of non-ophidian squamates can thus be looked
24
25 upon as ossifications of subsets of the “true” laterosphenoid.
26
27 The ossifications of Euparkeria and Proterosuchus alexanderi appear to
28
29
30 fundamentally conform to the crocodilian condition, and thus presumably to include
31
32 all three embryonic elements. However, the laterosphenoids of Euparkeria and
33
34 Proterosuchus differ from those of crocodilians in that a slender process is present,
35
36 markedly separating the foramen of CN III and CN IV from that of CN II (Figure 15,
37
38
39
sp). By contrast, in crocodilians, the separation of these nerves by the laterosphenoid
40
41 is made by a very modest process, the ventral portion of which is completed by a
42
43 dorsal extension of the cultriform process of the parabasisphenoid (Figure 21A, B, C).
44
45 These differences can be interpreted as indicating a greater degree of ossification of
46
47 the pila metoptica in Euparkeria and Proterosuchus than in crocodilians.
48
49
50 Furthermore, the foramina for the olfactory and optic nerves are only separated by a
51
52 brief contact of the right and left laterosphenoids in crocodilians (Figure 21D).
53
54 In contrast, in Euparkeria, and yet further so in Proterosuchus, the contact is
55
56 more extensive and the laterosphenoids of the fossil taxa extend further anteriorly
57
58
59
between the orbits than the ossification in crocodilians, reaching as far as the anterior
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 47 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 third of the orbit (in crocodilians the laterosphenoid does not reach the middle of the
4
5 orbit – e.g. Alligator sp. specimen 238 of the Biological Sciences Collection of the
6
7 University of Birmingham, UK). Such an anterior extension suggests a greater degree
8
9
10 of ossification of the taenia medialis than in crocodilians, and also potentially that
11
12 another embryonic element may, at least in part, be involved in the formation of the
13
14 laterosphenoid of Euparkeria and Proterosuchus, namely the planum supraseptale
15
16 (Figure 18). The planum supraseptale results from the fusion of the embryonic orbital
17
18
19
cartilages and, as mentioned above, supports the forebrain. The planum
20
21 supraseptale may form a ventral keel, the interorbital septum, to connect to the basal
22
23 plate and together interorbital septum and planum supraseptale are considered to
24
25 ossify as a third element, the sphenethmoid [84, 86].
26
27 Sphenethmoids are common ossifications identified in reptiliomorphs close to
28
29
30 amniotes such as diadectomorphs [88, 89], and also in basal reptilians such as
31
32 captorhinids and parareptiles [54, 90, 91] that are thought to be subsequently lost in
33
34 saurians [92]. Although, in many instances the sphenoid ossification does not ossify
35
36 farther posteriorly at the anterior region of the braincase (e.g. [93]), the term
37
38
39
“sphenethmoid” does include ossifications that would in theory comprise parts of the
40
41 laterosphenoid – the pila antotica, the pila metoptica and the taenia medialis [92, 94].
42
43 Thus, the sphenethmoid would be homologous to the laterosphenoid of stem
44
45 archosaurs and crocodilians. As revealed by the CT scans of SAM-PK-5867 and
46
47 UMCZ T.692, ossifications of the anterior braincase wall are very thin and delicate
48
49
50 structures that can be easily prepared away and it may well be that such structures
51
52 are indeed present in other basal diapsids. In fact, a sphenethmoid has been
53
54 identified in the diapsid of uncertain affinities Elachistosuchus huenei [95] and also
55
56 tentatively in Youngina ([96]; although it was not mentioned by Gardner et al. [65]).

3 The anterior braincase wall ossification of some basal pseudosuchians (e.g.
4
5 Stagonolepis olenkae [78]; Shuvosaurus [81]; Lehane [82]) appears to have been
6
7 more similar to that of Euparkeria and Proterosuchus alexanderi than to that of
8
9
10 modern crocodilians, in lacking a contact between the cultriform process and the
11
12 slender process. However, other basal pseudosuchians do show such a contact
13
14 (Stagonolepis robertsoni [72]; Desmatosuchus spurensis [97]), though whether the
15
16 parabasisphenoid formed part of the margin of the CN II foramen is not clear. The
17
18
19
anterior braincase wall of other fossil taxa closer to (e.g. Prestosuchus [80]) or within
20
21 (e.g. Sphenosuchus [68]) Crocodylomorpha are more similar to that of crocodilians in
22
23 that the ventral border of the foramen of CN II is formed by the basisphenoid.
24
25 The condition in extant birds is more similar to the one found in Euparkeria
26
27 and Proterosuchus alexanderi than to that in crocodilians, in that all the embryonic
28
29
30 structures (namely the pila antotica, pila metoptica, taenia medialis, planum
31
32 supraseptale and interorbital septum) ossify [84, 86] (Figures 19, 22). However, in
33
34 avian terminology, instead of sphenethmoid it is more common to find the terms
35
36 “interorbital septum” and/or “mesethmoid” for the ossifications anterior to the foramen
37
38
39
of CN II [98, 99]. The presence of these ossifications in dinosaurs is well documented
40
41 in derived ornithischians [66], sauropods [100–102], and theropods [60]. An
42
43 orbitosphenoid distinguished from the laterosphenoid is often described, although in
44
45 most cases sutures are difficult to identify.
46
47 A laterosphenoid is documented for a number of less derived crown taxa [29],
48
49
50 but well-preserved and complete elements suitable for a more detailed analysis are
51
52 still somewhat rare. The laterosphenoid of Heterodontosaurus tucki appears similar
53
54 to that of some pseudosuchians [103], in that a short spur makes the contact with the
55
56 basisphenoid. However, the contribution of the basisphenoid to the foramen of CN II
57
58
59
is unclear. The degree of ossification, as well as the anterior extension of this
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 49 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 structure, seems to include not only the pila antotica, but also the pila metoptica and
4
5 taenia medialis – but not the planum supraseptale. A distinction is made between
6
7 laterosphenoid and orbitosphenoid in figs. 2B and 15B of Norman et al. [103], but no
8
9
10 description is provided.
11
12 On the other hand, the laterosphenoids of Coelophysis bauri [29],
13
14 Lesothosaurus diagnosticus [21], Tawa hallae [27], as well as that of basal
15
16 ornithopods Dysalotosaurus [56], Thescelosaurus neglectus [104], and
17
18
19
Hypsilophodon foxii [105] are strikingly different. In these taxa, the ossification seems
20
21 to be restricted to the posterior part of the pila antotica only. As a consequence, the
22
23 exits of the cranial nerves I–IV are not represented by foramina and there is also no
24
25 contact to the cultriform process of the parabasisphenoid. A foramen for CN III is
26
27 identified for Lesothosaurus [21] but we regard that as unlikely due to its posterior
28
29
30 position. In these taxa, the laterosphenoid seems to correspond to the ossification of
31
32 the pila antotica only, resembling the laterosphenoid sensu Bellairs & Kamal [84].
33
34 Whether the anterior part of the ossification was not present or has been prepared
35
36 away, (or if these represent juvenile individuals) is unknown, but it is likely that a
37
38
39
reduction in the degree of ossification of the anterior braincase wall occurred in some
40
41 taxa. Laterosphenoids of more derived theropods such as Alioramus altai [106] or
42
43 Troodon formosus [107] are again represented by complex and extensive structures,
44
45 likely encompassing multiple embryonic elements.
46
47 Irrespective of the terminology employed, our main intention here is to
48
49
50 demonstrate that the laterosphenoids of Euparkeria, Proterosuchus alexanderi, and
51
52 other basal archosaurs do not appear to be exactly the same structure as the
53
54 laterosphenoid of extant crocodilians and may be more similar to that of extant birds
55
56 than previously acknowledged. Also, given the delicate nature of the ossifications of
57
58
59
the anterior braincase wall and the presence of such structures in a diapsid incertae
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 50 of 103
1
2
3 sedis (Elachistosuchus huenei [95]), it may be that these elements were not lost in
4
5 the evolutionary history of reptilians and subsequently reappeared in
6
7 archosauriforms, but that it has been present throughout Diapsida, being lost only at
8
9
10 a certain stage within Lepidosauromorpha.
11
12
13
14 Euparkeria in the context of wider diapsid braincase evolution
15
16 Since the seminal work of Gower & Weber [43], our knowledge of fossil
17
18
19
archosauromorph braincases has increased substantially thanks to a large number of
20
21 new descriptions [56, 57, 65, 69, 70, 78, 100, 108–111], as has our understanding of
22
23 the phylogenetic relationships of early and stem archosaurs [3, 29, 112–114]. It is
24
25 thus appropriate to attempt to place the braincase of Euparkeria capensis in the
26
27 context of the wider archosauromorph and eureptilian radiation, and in the
28
29
30 morphological trends seen both stemward and crownward of the taxon.
31
32 Increasing braincase height relative to anteroposterior length is identifiable as
33
34 a trend in archosauromorph and diapsid braincase evolution, with Gower & Sennikov
35
36 [51] first attempting to capture this change via the character of a verticalized
37
38
39
parabasisphenoid, with the basal tubera dorsal to the basipterygoid processes.
40
41 However, another degree of verticalization is found in non-archosauromorph diapsids
42
43 in the contact between basioccipital and parabasisphenoid, so that the occipital
44
45 condyle lies dorsal to the basal tubera. The braincase of basal eureptilians is
46
47 anteroposteriorly flat in spite of a very subtle angle formed by the contact between
48
49
50 parasphenoid and basioccipital (e.g. Captorhinus [54]), and the dorsoventral distance
51
52 between occipital condyle and the basal tubera increases in basal diapsids (e.g.
53
54 Youngina [65, 87]). The angulation of the parabasisphenoid first appears in
55
56 archosauromorphs.

2
3 In Euparkeria, the basal tubera are placed noticeably dorsal to the
4
5 basipterygoid processes in lateral view, and the occipital condyle is in turn dorsal to
6
7 the basal tubera (Figures 9C, 10B, 14E). This contrasts with the state in the
8
9
10 archosauromorph Prolacerta (Evans 1986; Gower & Sennikov 1996) [47, 51], and the
11
12 archosauriforms Proterosuchus fergusi [51], and Fugusuchus [51], which show much
13
14 more horizontal braincases. A relatively tall, verticalized parabasisphenoid is typical
15
16 of crown archosaurs (e.g. Coelophysis rhodesiensis [116]; Stagonolepis robertsoni
17
18
19
[68]), but it is also found in many archosauriforms (e.g. Erythrosuchus [62];
20
21 Sarmatosuchus otschevi [51]) and some archosauromorphs (Trilophosaurus – UCMP
22
23 V6374; Mesosuchus – SAM-PK-6536). Some archosaurs, however, do show a lesser
24
25 degree of angulation between basioccipital and parabasisphenoid (e.g.
26
27 Desmatosuchus spurensis [97]; Lewisuchus admixtus [79]; Silesaurus [69]; and
28
29
30 Stagonolepis olenkae [78]).
31
32 Another trend in diapsid and archosauromorph evolution is the increase in the
33
34 participation of the basioccipital in the braincase floor. As the myelencephalon
35
36 appears to correlate with the basioccipital and the parabasisphenoid with the
37
38
39
metencephalon, this may reflect an increase in the posterior part of the hindbrain
40
41 relative to the anterior part. Basal eureptilians have a parasphenoid as long as two
42
43 thirds of the anteroposterior length of the braincase (e.g. Captorhinus [54]). The
44
45 contribution of both elements is more equal in basal diapsids (e.g. Araeoscelis
46
47 gracilis [117]; Youngina [65, 115]). The situation is similar in the archosauromorph
48
49
50 Prolacerta [47], but the basioccipital contribution is somewhat greater in the
51
52 archosauromorphs Trilophosaurus [71] and Mesosuchus (SAM-PK-6536),
53
54 demonstrating that this “trend” is not uniform, given that these taxa are generally
55
56 placed lower on the stem than Prolacerta (e.g. [118]). In Euparkeria capensis, and
57
58
59
many crown taxa (e.g. Silesaurus [69]; Stagonolepis robertsoni [119]) the contribution
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 52 of 103
1
2
3 of the parabasisphenoid to the braincase floor is limited to at most the anterior third
4
5 (Figure 6C).
6
7 The contribution of the parabasisphenoid to the lateral braincase wall also
8
9
10 tends to decrease towards the archosaur crown, as it is replaced by the anterior
11
12 inferior process of the prootic. This development reflects assimilation of the
13
14 embryonic pila antotica by the bone (see below). The parabasisphenoid forms the
15
16 anteroventral border of the trigeminal notch in basal eureptilians (e.g. Captorhinus
17
18
19
[54]), but in diapsids its contribution decreases due to the development of a small
20
21 anterior inferior process (e.g. Youngina [65, 115]). Participation of the
22
23 parabasisphenoid disappears completely in archosauromorphs (e.g. Trilophosaurus
24
25 [71]; Mesosuchus – SAM-PK-6536; Prolacerta [47]), including Euparkeria.
26
27 Further development of the prootic is exemplified by increased ossification
28
29
30 dorsal to the foramen for CN V, by the relative positions of the trigeminal foramen and
31
32 that for CN VII, and by the prootic contribution to the dorsum sellae. These are all
33
34 connected to assimilations of further embryonic structures by the prootic. The region
35
36 of the prootic dorsal to the trigeminal notch and anterior to the otic capsule is the alar
37
38
39
process [86], and appears to be absent, or very weakly developed, in early
40
41 eureptilians (e.g. Captorhinus [54]). The process becomes more ossified towards the
42
43 crown and in Euparkeria, Fugusuchus and Xilousuchus [51], and Erythrosuchus [62]
44
45 (BPI 3893) it shows an extensive degree of ossification. The prootic may continue to
46
47 expand anterodorsally in crown archosaurs, and eventually enclose the foramen of
48
49
50 CN V entirely (e.g. Dysalotosaurus [56]).
51
52 The ossification of the body of the prootic is related to the otic capsule and to
53
54 the prefacial and basicapsular commissures – connections of cartilage formed
55
56 between the otic capsule and the basal plate [86]. Its lateral wall is characterized by
57
58
59
the presence of the crista prootica, ventral to which the trigeminal and facial nerves
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 53 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 exit the braincase. In basal eureptilians, the foramina for the nerves lie in the same
4
5 horizontal plane, also indicated by a horizontal crest (e.g. Captorhinus [54]). In
6
7 diapsids (e.g. Youngina [115]), a shift occurs in the relative positions of these
8
9
10 foramina, with the facial foramen lying a short distance ventral to the trigeminal
11
12 foramen. The crest thus curves gently in an anteroventral direction. In
13
14 archosauromorphs the morphology is more varied, and some taxa show a roughly
15
16 horizontal crest (e.g. Prolacerta [47]), while the crest of others is strongly inclined
17
18
19
(e.g. Mesosuchus – SAM-PK-6536). The foramina in archosauriforms, including
20
21 Euparkeria, are also asymmetrically positioned, albeit not to the same degree as in
22
23 Mesosuchus (e.g. Fugusuchus, Garjania, Xilousuchus [51]; Erythrosuchus [62]). A
24
25 stronger anteroventral inclination of the crista is also found also in crown archosaurs
26
27 (e.g. Silesaurus [69]; Stagonolepis olenkae [78]).
28
29
30 The exact extent of the contribution of the prootic and parabasisphenoid to the
31
32 dorsum sellae is difficult to confirm in some taxa. It is formed by the basisphenoid
33
34 only in basal eureptilians (e.g. Captorhinus [54]), in basal diapsids (e.g. Youngina
35
36 [65]), and at least in some archosauromorphs (e.g. Prolacerta [47]). The participation
37
38
39
of the prootic in Euparkeria indicates assimilation of the embryonic basal plate by the
40
41 prootic [86].
42
43 The hearing system also shows considerable changes along the diapsid and
44
45 archosauromorph lineages. A pattern that has been extensively discussed in the
46
47 evolution of the hearing system is the identification of the elements forming the
48
49
50 border of the fenestra ovalis. The relative contributions of these bones are of
51
52 particular interest in the construction of homology statements [120]. In basal
53
54 eureptilians [54] and the basal diapsid Araeoscelis gracilis [117], the parasphenoid,

3 prootic anterodorsally. In Euparkeria capensis, the prootic and opisthotic form most of
4
5 the anterior and posterior borders of the fenestra ovalis respectively, with a small
6
7 posteroventral contribution by the basioccipital on the medial side of the fenestra,
8
9
10 and a contribution to the anterior rim by the posterodorsal process of the
11
12 parabasisphenoid (Figure 6C). In extant archosaurs the prootic and opisthotic alone
13
14 form the border of the fenestra ovalis [43], but in several extinct crown archosaurs
15
16 (e.g. [56, 69]) the basioccipital and parabasisphenoid are not completely excluded
17
18
19
from the fenestra ovalis, with very restricted contributions at its ventralmost extent,
20
21 whilst in other extinct crown taxa [97] and in erythrosuchids [62] a small basioccipital
22
23 contribution at least is reported. However, this trend is not clear cut, as in the basal
24
25 diapsid Youngina, and the archosauromorphs Prolacerta and Trilophosaurus the
26
27 basioccipital appears to have been totally excluded from the fenestra ovalis by the
28
29
30 opisthotic [47, 65, 71, 115].
31
32 Elongation of the semicircular canals is seen in crown archosaurs in
33
34 comparison to the only fossil basal diapsid for which the structure of the semicircular
35
36 canals is well known – Youngina [65]. Strongly elongated semicircular canals are
37
38
39
seen in flying and gliding taxa [121]. It indicates that elongation facilitates improved
40
41 locomotor agility, with elongation of a particular semicircular canal corresponding to
42
43 increased sensitivity in its plane of action [60, 75]. The inner ear of Euparkeria shows
44
45 relatively elongated semicircular canals with larger radii of curvature when compared
46
47 to Youngina, especially the posterior semicircular canal. They are, however, not as
48
49
50 strongly elongated as those of coelurosaurian theropods (especially birds; [75, 121,
51
52 122]) and pterosaurs [121], where the anterior semicircular canal is particularly
53
54 elongated. Similarly, the size of the floccular lobe, and thus the floccular fossa in
55
56 which it sits, has been hypothesized to facilitate agility [123], as it emits coordination-
57
58
59
related responses important in movements of the head and eyes [124]. In Euparkeria,
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 55 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 the floccular fossa is larger than in Youngina, but much smaller than in modern birds
4
5 [122]. Taken together, the form of the semicircular canals and floccular lobe may be
6
7 indicative of the more upright, agile locomotory pattern seen in Euparkeria than in
8
9
10 “sprawling” diapsids such as Youngina.
11
12 An increase in cochlear length is also evident when the cochlea of Euparkeria
13
14 and other basal taxa such as Youngina and Captorhinus are compared, indicating
15
16 improved hearing ability. Different groups of hair cells have stereocilia with varying
17
18
19
degrees of length and stiffness, and the mass of the basilar membrane itself changes
20
21 topologically. Thus, different parts of the cochlea resonate differently to the same
22
23 sound frequency and the auditory epithelium is said to be tonotopically arranged
24
25 along its axis [125, 126]. In order to expand the hearing range, an increased number
26
27 of cells are necessary, resulting in a longer cochlea. This is called mechanical tuning,
28
29
30 and is assumed to correspond to the plesiomorphic type of tonotopic discrimination in
31
32 amniotes [127, 128]. However, physiological tuning mechanisms such as electrical
33
34 resonance became predominant during the evolutionary history of birds and turtles.
35
36 In these, hair cells set up a voltage gradient via active K+/Ca2+ channels, oscillating in
37
38
39
response to a depolarizing stimulus [128]. Although the elongation of the cochlea is
40
41 also present in birds, and to a lesser extent also in crocodylians, it seems to be less
42
43 important for sound discrimination than the physiological properties of the inner ear.
44
45 Because mechanical tuning is an important property of the ear of extant
46
47 mammals and squamates [125, 127], but not so much for birds and turtles [128], it is
48
49
50 likely that basal archosauromorphs also relied on such mechanisms. A further,
51
52 indirect indication of the importance of mechanical tuning in hearing is extensive
53
54 ossification of the otic capsule. Increased ossification raises the stiffness of the
55
56 system and influences frequency response by reducing energy loss due to flexion
57
58
59
[129]. Increased ossification also promotes acoustic isolation, hindering sound
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 56 of 103
1
2
3 conduction along routes other than those where sound detecting tissues are located.
4
5 However, acoustic isolation without a compensatory mechanism for pressure-relief
6
7 can limit hearing capacity [74, 130]. Crown group archosaurs developed a
8
9
10 specialized pressure-relief window, a fenestra pseudorotunda, in which the metotic
11
12 foramen becomes subdivided into anterior and posterior regions [43]. The
13
14 compensatory mechanism of the fenestra pseudorotunda can, to a lesser extent, be
15
16 carried out by the undivided metotic foramen [86]. The medial wall of the otic capsule
17
18
19
of most eureptilians is extensively unossified, but the metotic foramen becomes
20
21 increasingly enlarged. The metotic foramen of Euparkeria is even more enlarged than
22
23 that of Captorhinus [54], Youngina [115] or Prolacerta [47], and there is further
24
25 differentiation of a pressure-relief region ventrally.
26
27 Some of the changes seen in the lineage leading to Euparkeria, and
28
29
30 subsequently within the archosaur crown, relate to the changing ecomorphology of
31
32 the taxa. A general increase in ossification of the braincase may be indicative of
33
34 development of the forebrain and improvement of terrestrial hearing. Furthermore,
35
36 increased length of the semicircular canals and increased size of the floccular lobe
37
38
39
are probably indicative of the change from a sprawling to upright gait. The changes
40
41 witnessed along the lineage leading to Euparkeria and beyond can thus be framed as
42
43 part of the broader terrestrial amniote pattern of increasing adaptation to terrestriality,
44
45 including locomotion and hearing, and of development of increased cognitive
46
47 abilities.

52 CONCLUSIONS
53
54 For the first time, a complete description of the braincase of Euparkeria capensis is
55
56 undertaken based on all available material. We were able confirm and correct several
57
58
59
details of descriptions published previously. For instance, we confirm the presence of
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 57 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 a laterosphenoid in the anterior braincase region of Euparkeria, and find that the
4
5 element may not be fully homologous with that present in extant crocodylians, with
6
7 the crocodilian condition being less ossified. We also homologise the anterior
8
9
10 tympanic recess of Eupakeria with that of other basal archosaurs. The elongation of
11
12 the semicircular canals (the anterior in particular) and the enlargement of the
13
14 floccular fossa may correspond to development of a more upright posture and a more
15
16 active lifestyle in Euparkeria than in basal diapsids and taxa further down the
17
18
19
archosaur stem. The enlargement of the fenestra ovalis and of the metotic foramen,
20
21 together with the regionalisation of the latter and the elongation of the cochlea, are
22
23 considered to be related to extension of the hearing range and improvements in the
24
25 impedance matching functions of the inner ear, pointing to further development of a
26
27 sense of hearing more adapted to terrestrial environments.

3 ABSTRACT
4
5 Since its discovery, Euparkeria capensis has been a key taxon for understanding the
6
7 early evolution of archosaurs. The braincase of Euparkeria was described based on a
8
9
10 single specimen, but much uncertainty remained. For the first time, all available
11
12 braincase material of Euparkeria are reexamined through micro-computed
13
14 tomography scanning. Contrary to previous work, the parabasisphenoid does not
15
16 form the posterior border of the fenestra ovalis, but bears a dorsal projection forming

its anteroventral half laterally. No bone pneumatisation was found, but the lateral
20
21 depression of the parabasisphenoid may have been pneumatic. We propose the
22
23 depression likely corresponds to the anterior tympanic recess present in crown
24
25 archosaurs. Presence of a laterosphenoid is confirmed for Euparkeria. It largely
26
27 conforms to the crocodilian condition, but shows some features which make it
28
29
30 relatively more similar to the avemetatarsalian laterosphenoid. The cochlea of
31
32 Euparkeria is elongate. The metotic foramen is much enlarged and regionalized,
33
34 indicating an increase in its pressure-relief mechanism. The anterior semicircular
35
36 canal is extended and corresponds to an enlarged floccular fossa. These aspects of
37
38
39
the braincase morphology may both be related to the development of a more upright
40
41 posture and active lifestyle, and indicate further adaptations of the diapsid hearing
42
43 system to terrestriality.

52 INTRODUCTION
53
54 Archosauria, a crown group of diapsid reptiles represented today by birds and
55
56 crocodilians and including the extinct dinosaurs, is highly speciose (with over 9,000
57
58
59
species of bird and crocodilian – [1]) and has been so since the Late Triassic.

3 Archosaurs filled most large-bodied terrestrial ecological niches for over 150 million
4
5 years [2–4], from the Late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous. The rise of the
6
7 archosaurs to this position of ecological dominance took place following diversity
8
9
10 decline among therapsids, which had previously filled most macroscale terrestrial
11
12 niches (e.g. [2, 4, 6–13]). This faunal transition began at the end of the Permian and
13
14 continued through the Triassic [4, 13, 14]. The rise of archosaurs is a landmark
15
16 terrestrial faunal transition and an outstanding example of an ecological radiation
17
18
19
over geological timescales [3].
20
21 Euparkeria capensis is a small (known individuals reaching c. 1 m in length [15])
22
23 stem archosaur represented by the remains of over 10 individuals collected from a
24
25 single locality in Subzone B of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone [16,17] (the
26
27 uppermost biozone of the Burgersdorp Formation and the Beaufort Group), close to
28
29
30 Aliwal North, Eastern Cape, South Africa [15, 18]. Subzone B is probably Anisian
31
32 (Middle Triassic) in age (see [17]). Since its discovery, Euparkeria has been
33
34 considered to be an important taxon for our understanding of the rise and early
35
36 evolution of archosaurs. Euparkeria is nearly universally found to be either the sister
37
38
39
taxon to, or a very close relative of, Archosauria in phylogenetic analyses [3, 19–29].
40
41 For this reason Euparkeria is often used as an outgroup in phylogenetic and
42
43 evolutionary analyses of crown taxa (e.g. [30–42]), allowing the sequence and
44
45 direction of morphological changes during the radiation of Archosauria to be
46
47 understood.
48
49
50 Given its phylogenetic position and lack of striking autapomorphies, the
51
52 morphology of Euparkeria has been considered to potentially approach that of the
53
54 ancestor of Archosauria, and thus may shed light on the early evolution of archosaurs
55
56 (see [43]). The gracile, cursorial body plan of Euparkeria represents a morphological
57
58
59
stage intermediate between more “sprawling” non-archosaurian archosauromorph
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 4 of 103
1
2
3 taxa and the fully erect, and often bipedal [13, 44, 45]. Beyond this, Euparkeria itself
4
5 represents a part of the broader radiation of archosauromorphs, within which the
6
7 crown radiation is nested. Although often used as a phylogenetic outgroup to
8
9
10 Archosauria, Euparkeria can also be seen as displaying a relatively derived
11
12 braincase morphology (e.g. relatively high, dorsoventrally elongated
13
14 parabasisphenoid, elongated semicircular canals – see below) representing the
15
16 culmination of morphological developments which begin further down the archosaur
17
18
19
stem.
20
21 The braincase of Euparkeria was originally described by Ewer [15], based on the
22
23 holotype – SAM-PK-5867, SAM-PK-7696, and UMZC T.692 (“Watson’s specimen A”;
24
25 formerly R 527), in a monographic treatment of the taxon. Subsequently an isolated
26
27 braincase from specimen SAM-PK-7696 was further acid prepared, and was
28
29
30 described by Cruickshank [46]. Evans [47] figured this same isolated braincase and
31
32 used it as a comparator in her treatment of the braincase of Prolacerta broomi.
33
34 Welman [48] figured both SAM-PK-7696 and the braincase of the holotype, which
35
36 had been further mechanically prepared in the interim. Welman [48] compared the
37
38
39
morphology of the braincase of Euparkeria to that of birds, dinosaurs and
40
41 crocodilians, and came to the controversial conclusion that Euparkeria was more
42
43 closely related to birds than to dinosaurs or crocodilians, resurrecting the idea that
44
45 birds and dinosaurs had separate origins among the “thecodonts”, a paraphyletic
46
47 assemblage of stem archosaurs and early pseudosuchians [49]. Gower and Weber
48
49
50 [43] thoroughly redescribed the braincase of Euparkeria, based primarily on UMZC
51
52 T.692. In addition to providing a comprehensive reference work, these authors
53
54 presented evidence refuting the presence or importance of most of the anatomical
55
56 features used by Welman [48] to link Euparkeria to birds to the exclusion of other
57
58
59
archosaurs.

3 Here, we provide a thorough redescription of the osteology of the braincase of
4
5 Euparkeria, building on the work of Gower and Weber [43] and bringing new
6
7 clarification to points of doubt, documenting new information, and confirming areas
8
9
10 where our understanding is limited by the material. Although the work of Gower and
11
12 Weber [43] was thorough given the material available to the authors, recent
13
14 advances in computed tomography (CT) allow new insights. All material pertaining to
15
16 the braincase of Euparkeria was available for us to examine, and we were able to CT
17
18
19
scan the specimen available to Gower and Weber [43] (UMZC T.692), the holotype
20
21 (SAM-PK-5867), specimen SAM-PK-6047A, and the isolated braincase SAM-PK-
22
23 7696.
24
25 This approach allows us to provide additional information on sutures and contacts
26
27 between elements, as well as details of the internal structures of the braincase and
28
29
30 the morphology of the inner ear. Furthermore, we provide thorough documentation of
31
32 the element generally regarded as a laterosphenoid in Euparkeria, describing for the
33
34 first time the morphology of this element in SAM-PK-5867, and conducting an
35
36 extensive discussion of its morphology and potential homology.
37
38
39
Our contribution makes the braincase of Euparkeria one of the best-documented
40
41 early archosauriform braincases and provides a reference point for archosauriform
42
43 morphologists that will contribute to a growing understanding of the rise and
44
45 evolutionary radiation of the archosaurs.

Basioccipital
40
41 The basioccipital forms the majority of the occipital condyle, with only the
42
43 dorsolateral corners of the condyle formed by the exoccipitals. The entire occipital
44
45 condyle (including the exoccipital contribution) is hemispherical, with the dorsal
46
47 margin being very gently concave in posterior view (Figures 1B, 7B, 11B). There is no
48
49
50 pronounced ridge delimiting the condyle from the condyle neck (Figure 11B), unlike in
51
52 Dorosuchus neoetus [50], nor is there a notochordal pit. The contribution of the
53
54 basioccipital to the border of the foramen magnum is very limited, not accounting for
55
56 more than the middle-third of the ventral border of the foramen (Figures 1B, 6A, 11B).
57
58
59
Thus, the interpretation of Cruickshank [46] (fig. 2; also Gower and Weber [43], fig.
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 8 of 103

2
3 1b) to some extent exaggerated the basioccipital contribution to the foramen
4
5 magnum. The basioccipital articulates with the exoccipital in a dorsomedial-
6
7 ventrolateral orientated plane, below the foramen for cranial nerve (CN) XII (Figure
8
9
10 6A, C).
11
12 Anterior to the occipital condyle the basioccipital expands laterally to form the
13
14 basioccipital contribution to the basal tubera (Figures 7B, 8B). A low, rounded ridge
15
16 extends obliquely from the occipital condyle to about half way down the contribution
17
18
19
on each side, separating a more horizontally orientated ventral surface of the
20
21 basioccipital from a more vertically orientated dorsal surface (Figure 7B, ri). In UMCZ
22
23 T.692, the dorsal parts of the expanded part of the basioccipital contribution on each
24
25 side appear to be missing [43] (fig. 4). This ridge seems to be the posterior
26
27 counterpart of the concave articular surface (for the parabasisphenoid) that is located
28
29
30 on the anterior face of the contribution of the basioccipital to the basal tuber, as seen
31
32 in Prolacerta [47] (fig. 6).
33
34 The basal tubera are clearly separated in posterior view, but are connected to
35
36 each other by a low ridge (Figures 1D, 11A, ri) which formed the posterior margin of
37
38
39
the basioccipital–basisphenoid fossa [51]. This fossa forms the posterior part of the
40
41 ventral median pharyngeal recess (sensu Witmer [52]; Figure 7B, mpr); the posterior
42
43 surface of the parabasisphenoid lacks the ‘intertuberal plate’ that separates the
44
45 basioccipital-basisphenoid fossa from the rest of the median pharyngeal recess in
46
47 some other Triassic archosauriforms (see, for example [51]).
48
49
50 The basioccipital also forms the floor of the metotic foramen. The suture
51
52 between basioccipital and parabasisphenoid extends in a gently meandering line
53
54 transversely across the braincase, ending laterally close to the posteroventral corner
55
56 of the fenestra ovalis (Figure 3D). Thus the basioccipital contributes to the posterior
57
58
59
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 9 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 portion of the floor of the fenestra ovalis; in lateral view, the suture line extends
4
5 straight ventrally (Figure 6C).
6
7 The lateral margin of the basioccipital dorsal to the basal tuber forms the
8
9
10 posterior margin of the “unossified gap” of Gower & Weber [43] (Figure 1E, 2E,
11
12 un.gp) also bounded by the ventral ramus of the opisthotic and the
13
14 parabasisphenoid; the gap is well preserved as an open channel on the right hand
15
16 side of SAM-PK-7696 and in SAM-PK-5867 (see below; Figure 9A, B, un.gp).
17
18
19
20
21 Parabasisphenoid
22
23 The parabasisphenoid forms the ventral part of the braincase anterior to the
24
25 basioccipital, ventral to the prootics. The basal tubera are displaced dorsally in
26
27 comparison to the basipterygoid processes (Figure 13B), and the part of the
28
29
30 parabasisphenoid between them can thus be described as vertically rather than
31
32 horizontally aligned (following Gower and Sennikov [51]). The basipterygoid
33
34 processes are well preserved in SAM-PK-K6047A (Figure 12B, C, E, F), in SAM-PK-
35
36 5867 (Figure 7B, 11A), and UMCZ T.692 (Figure 13A, B, E). They are slightly
37
38
39
anteroposteriorly elongated ovals in ventral view, and anterodorsally-posteroventrally
40
41 elongated ovals in lateral view. The distal tips of the basipterygoid processes are
42
43 ventrolaterally and slightly posteriorly directed.
44
45 The ventral surface of the parabasisphenoid forms the anterior two thirds of
46
47 the median pharyngeal recess (Figures 1D, 7B, mpr) between the basal tubera and
48
49
50 the basipterygoid processes. The recess bears no foramina. The suture with the
51
52 basioccipital extends across the recess in a gently meandering line which is slightly
53
54 anteriorly convexly curved in overall trajectory in ventral view (Figures 1D, 3D, 7B).
55
56 The anterior bases of the basal tubera are connected to each other by rounded lips
57
58
59
of bone that meet in the midline, forming the anterior border of the median
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 10 of 103
1
2
3 pharyngeal recess. They join with a median ridge extending from the ventral surface
4
5 of the cultriform process, and together form a tubercle which projects posteriorly
6
7 under the anterior part of the median pharyngeal recess (Figure 7B).
8
9
10 CT data show the suture between parabasisphenoid and prootic extends
11
12 obliquely from posterolaterally to anteromedially in dorsal view (Figure 6B, s.bs.pr).
13
14 However, the parabasisphenoid bears an ascending process posteriorly that
15
16 conceals part of the lateral surface of the prootic and which forms the anteroventral
17
18
19
border of the fenestra ovalis (Figure 2E, apB). Thus, in lateral view, the contact
20
21 between prootic and parabasisphenoid can be described in two parts: the first, more
22
23 posterior part, is anteroventrally inclined and extends from the fenestra ovalis to the
24
25 groove for CN VII; the second, more anterior part, is anterodorsally inclined and
26
27 starts anterior to the “lateral depression” of the parabasisphenoid and the groove for
28
29
30 CN VII (Figure 2B). This interpretation of the relationships between these two bones
31
32 differs from that of previous authors and is discussed below.
33
34 The basal tubera are mostly lost in SAM-PK-5867 and completely lost in SAM-
35
36 PK-7696. However, based on what remains in those two specimens and on UMZC
37
38
39
T.692 and SAM-PK-6047A, the parabasisphenoid contribution to the basal tubera
40
41 extends posteroventrally and laterally from near the anteroventral margin of the
42
43 fenestra ovalis (Figures 12F, 13B, D, E). On the right hand side of SAM-PK-7696, the
44
45 lateral surface of the parabasisphenoid contribution to the basal tuber bears a deep,
46
47 posteroventrally open sulcus - the semilunar depression of Gower and Weber [43]
48
49
50 and Evans [53] (Figure 1E, 2E, sd). This cannot have been an articulation for the
51
52 ventral ramus of the opisthotic (as suggested by Evans [53]), as the braincase is
53
54 articulated and the ventral ramus of the opisthotic instead ends more posteriorly,
55
56 close to the basioccipital contribution to the basal tuber, and connected to the
57
58
59
parabasisphenoid laterally by a thin strip of bone. Posterior to the semilunar
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 11 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 depression, and anterior to the distal end of the ventral ramus of the opisthotic, is the
4
5 “unossified gap” (Figure 1E, 2E, un.gp).
6
7 Anterior to the anterodorsal extremity of the basal tuber, the lateral surface of
8
9
10 the parabasisphenoid is deeply concave (the “lateral depression” of Gower and
11
12 Weber [43]; Figure 2E, ld). This concavity is confluent with the groove for the palatine
13
14 branch of cranial nerve VII (Figure 2E, CN VIIpal), which extends down the lateral
15
16 surface of the prootic and would have continued down the anterolateral surface of the
17
18
19
basipterygoid process as an osseous groove, as in other reptilians (e.g. Captorhinus
20
21 [54]; Ctenosaura [55]; Dysalotosaurus – [56]), but is not observable due to
22
23 preservation.
24
25 In lateral view, the posterior third of the braincase floor is relatively horizontal,
26
27 though convex (Figure 3B). More anteriorly, the floor slopes ventrally (Figure 3B), and
28
29
30 a low median ridge (Figure 3D, md.rd) divides this sloping section into left and right
31
32 halves, both of which are gently concave. The anterior third of the floor shows two
33
34 large, oval depressions (Figure 3B, D, ov.dp) with their longer axes extending
35
36 posterolaterally-anteromedially. These depressions are a little deeper anteriorly than
37
38
39
posteriorly, and they are separated by a thick, dorsally flat strip of the braincase floor,
40
41 which may have connected to the ridge seen more posteriorly on the braincase floor
42
43 (this cannot be ascertained because of damage to the braincase floor in SAM-PK-
44
45 7696).
46
47 The ventral surface of the parabasiphenoid between the basipterygoid
48
49
50 processes is very gently concave, with a pronounced median ridge extending from
51
52 the anterior margin of the median pharyngeal recess to the base of the cultriform
53
54 process (=rostrum) of the parabasisphenoid (Figure 11A). This ventral surface bears,
55
56 on each side, a foramen for the internal carotid artery (Figure 11A, ica), placed at the
57
58
59
posteromedial base of the basipterygoid process, immediately anterior to the lips of
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos

1
2
3 bone connecting the basal tubera (see above). The cultriform process (Figure 12C–
4
5 E, 13, cp) is elongated and tapers to a distal point, and its dorsal margin dips slightly
6
7 ventrally close to its base then moves dorsally again yet further proximally. In cross
8
9
10 section the cultriform process is deeply excavated dorsally, forming a U shape in
11
12 anterior view.
13
14 In anterior view, the suture between the parabasisphenoid and the prootic
15
16 extends from ventrolaterally to dorsomedially, through the foramen of CN VI on each
17
18
19
side (the margin of which is thus formed half by the parabasisphenoid and half by the
20
21 prootic), meeting in an apex at the midline close to the dorsal border of the dorsum
22
23 sellae (Figure 2A, s.bs.pr). The posterior wall of the hypophyseal fossa is gently
24
25 concave transversely and has a central, low ridge extending dorsoventrally. The
26
27 clinoid processes (Figures 1A, 2A, cp) protrude a small distance medially over the
28
29
30 posterior wall of the hypophyseal fossa, concealing the lateral borders of the
31
32 foramina for CN VI when viewed directly anteriorly.

The contact between exoccipital and basioccipital is very short (Figure 6),

41 confirming the observation of Gower and Weber [43] that the exoccipital is restricted
42
43 to the pillar between the foramen magnum and the metotic foramen. The lateral
44
45 surface of this pillar is smooth and shows no lateral ridge (sensu Gower [57]; Figure
46
47 1E). The exoccipitals form the dorsolateral corners of the occipital condyle, and in
48
49
50 SAM-PK-7696 do not meet at the midline to exclude the basioccipital from the
51
52 foramen magnum (Figures 1B, 2B). On first inspection SAM-PK-5867 presents the
53
54 impression that the exoccipitals did exclude the basioccipital from the foramen
55
56 magnum (Figure 7B), but this appears to be due to mediolateral compression of the
57
58
59
braincase compounded by a preparation artefact. In UMZC T.692 the left side of the
60

Page 13 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 braincase is disarticulated and was not scanned with the main block of the material.
4
5 The right exoccipital, however, is preserved in contact with the basioccipital (Figure
6
7 14B) and a line of fracture likely represents their contact. In this specimen, the
8
9
10 exoccipital extends further medially than in SAM-PK-5867, almost reaching the
11
12 midline, but does not seem to contact its counterpart, as noted by Gower and Weber
13
14 [43]. Although the braincase is not laterally compressed, the exoccipital seems to be
15
16 somewhat displaced medially from its original position, decreasing the distance
17
18
19
between left and right elements. In addition, the exoccipital facets on the basioccipital
20
21 are directed slightly outwards, again indicating lack of contact. We thus conclude that
22
23 there is a basioccipital contribution to the foramen magnum, but this contribution
24
25 seems to be smaller in SAM-PK-5867 and UMZC T.692 than in SAM-PK-7696. The
26
27 basioccipital is missing in SAM-PK-6047A.
28
29
30 The anterior two-thirds of the suture between the exoccipital and opisthotic are
31
32 identifiable in CT scans of SAM-PK-7696, and in posterior view it is slanted
33
34 dorsomedially-ventrolaterally (Figure 6B, s.eo.op). Exactly where this suture emerges
35
36 posteriorly is not entirely clear in any specimen, but based on the part of the suture
37
38
39
visible internally in the scans, its path would roughly describe an arch that begins at
40
41 the base of the paroccipital process and reaches up to the dorsal border of the
42
43 foramen magnum. On the left side of SAM-PK-7696 there is a meandering line that
44
45 broadly follows this same arch (Figure 1B, red line; 2B); this line separates a more
46
47 ventral, smoother and depressed area from a more dorsal, rougher, and more convex
48
49
50 area. This line almost certainly represents the exoccipital-opisthotic suture as it
51
52 follows its expected trajectory, though its continuation cannot be traced internally; a
53
54 slight groove is visible in SAM-PK-5867 in a similar position to the line in SAM-PK-
55
56 7696 (Figure 11B, blue line). In SAM-PK-7696 the posterior surface of the exoccipital
57
58
59
is damaged at the point where this probable suture line would contact the border of
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 14 of 103
1
2
3 the foramen magnum, preventing clarity regarding the exact contribution of the
4
5 exoccipital to the foramen. However, it is probable, based on the suture line within the
6
7 bone, that the exoccipital formed the lateral rim of the foramen magnum as well as
8
9
10 the lateral parts of its dorsal rim. In SAM-PK-7696 the supraoccipital-opisthotic suture
11
12 cannot be located, but in SAM-PK-5867, the supraoccipital-opisthotic suture line hits
13
14 the probable exoccipital-opisthotic suture line immediately lateral to the border of the
15
16 foramen magnum (Figure 11B, red line), meaning that the opisthotic is excluded from
17
18
19
the foramen, and the suture between the supraoccipital and exoccipital consists of a
20
21 brief point contact at the border of the foramen magnum.
22
23 A depressed area (see above) below the exoccipital-opisthotic suture line is
24
25 clearly present on the posterior surface of the exoccipital in SAM-PK-7696, being
26
27 especially pronounced on the right hand side (Figure 1B). This feature is less
28
29
30 apparent in SAM-PK-5867 (Figure 11B). Whether this area represents a particular
31
32 functional feature is unclear, but it certainly does not represent any exit foramina, as
33
34 the CT scans show no traces of internal paths. In SAM-PK-7696, on the right lateral
35
36 surface of the exoccipital, there are two well-marked foramina for the anterior and
37
38
39
posterior branches of CN XII (Figure 5A, CN XIIa, CN XIIp) – the posterior foramen
40
41 (CNXIIp) is somewhat larger and more dorsally located. A short distance anterior and
42
43 ventral to these, there seems to be a third foramen, which, in the CT scans, does not
44
45 penetrate far into the bone (Figure 5A, ?CN XI). If a real feature, however, this
46
47 foramen could represent an independent exit for the accessory nerve (CN XI). On the
48
49
50 left side, the foramen for the posterior branch of CN XII is clearly visible, but because
51
52 the area anterior to it is somewhat damaged, the foramen for the anterior branch of
53
54 CN XII is located more medially. There is no corresponding foramen to the third
55
56 foramen seen on the right hand side. In SAM-PK-5867, only one foramen is clearly

3 visible in this area of the exoccipital, corresponding to the exit of the posterior branch
4

9
10 Opisthotic
11
12 The opisthotic forms most of the paroccipital processes and the lateral wall of
13
14 the braincase between the fenestra ovalis and the metotic foramen. Contrary to
15
16 Cruickshank [46], the opisthotic does not participate in the borders of the foramen
17
18
19
magnum. The contact between opisthotic and prootic is broad (sensu Nesbitt [29],
20
21 state 0 of character 105), being dorsoventrally extended and reaching up to half the
22
23 length of the paroccipital process (Figure 6). However, the prootic contribution to the
24
25 paroccipital process is restricted to a sheet of bone covering the anterior surface of
26
27 the process, the bulk of the process being formed by the opisthotic (Figure 1A, E).
28
29
30 The paroccipital processes protrude posterolaterally and dorsally (Figures 1, 7,
31
32 11). They are oval in cross section and the shaft is gently twisted along its length, so
33
34 that the dorsal surface twists to face more posterodorsally at the distal end. The distal
35
36 tips are gently rounded and separated from the main shaft of the processes by a
37
38
39
slight constriction. The distalmost tip of the right process is missing in SAM-PK-7696.
40
41 The paroccipital processes are excavated postero- and anteroventrally by the dorsal
42
43 borders of the metotic foramen and the fenestra ovalis (recessus stapedialis),
44
45 respectively. These excavations are separated by a ridge (corresponding to the crista
46
47 interfenestralis of Oelrich [55]) ascending from the ventral ramus of the opisthotic and
48
49
50 ending approximately half way along the paroccipital process shaft (Figure 5A, ci).
51
52 The ventral ramus of the opisthotic (Figures 1B, F, 2B, F, vrop) descends
53
54 ventrally from the base of the paroccipital process and bends gently posteriorly. It
55
56 separates the fenestra ovalis anteriorly from the metotic foramen posteriorly. In
57
58
59
posterior view, the ventral ramus of the opisthotic is clearly visible, with its lateral
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 16 of 103
1
2
3 margin offset laterally from that of the exoccipital by a distance roughly equal to the
4
5 width of the exoccipital (Figures 1B, 2B, vrop). In posterior view, the lateral margin of
6
7 the ventral ramus of the opisthotic is laterally concave, and extends from
8
9
10 ventromedially to dorsolaterally. The distal end of the ventral ramus of the opisthotic
11
12 is roughly level with the dorsoventral midpoint of the occipital condyle. In transverse
13
14 cross section, the long axis of the ramus is anteromedially to posterolaterally
15
16 directed; the perilymphatic duct would thus have extended anterolaterally to
17
18
19
posteromedially (see below). On the anterior surface of the left ventral ramus of
20
21 SAM-PK-7696 the well-marked lagenar crest protrudes anteriorly (Figure 5A, B,
22
23 lg.cr), separating the vestibular region dorsally from the cochlear region ventrally.
24
25 This structure is missing on the right side. The distal end of the ventral ramus of the
26
27 opisthotic is expanded laterally, anteriorly and posteriorly compared to the rest of the
28
29
30 shaft, but this expansion does not compare to that seen in some other stem
31
32 archosaur taxa (e.g. Garjainia prima [51]).
33
34 On the ventral border of the right fenestra ovalis in SAM-PK-7696, there is a
35
36 thin sagittal bony contact between the ventral ramus of the opisthotic and the
37
38
39
posterior region of the parabasisphenoid (Figure 2E, bb). This bony contact forms the
40
41 lateral limit of a small foramen (Figure 2E, ug), the medial edge of which is delimited
42
43 by the lateral surfaces of the basioccipital and the parabasisphenoid forming the
44
45 braincase floor. The ventrolaterally open area ventral to this foramen was identified
46
47 by Cruickshank [46] as the lagenar recess, whereas Gower & Weber [43] identify it
48
49
50 as an “unossified gap”. This area was probably covered by cartilage, with the tip of
51
52 the lagena projecting through the foramen – see below.
53
54 On the dorsal part of the medial wall of the opisthotic, there are two confluent,
55
56 medially open depressions (Figure 3A, B, cc, psc). One is smaller and positioned
57
58
59
more anterodorsally than the other. The first corresponds to the common, dorsal
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 17 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 openings of the anterior and posterior semicircular canals, termed common crus. The
4
5 second, posteroventral one corresponds to the posterior ampulla, from which the
6
7 posterior semicircular canal leaves the vestibule. On the right hand side of SAM-PK-
8
9
10 7696, the ventral ramus of the opisthotic has a large, rounded notch occupying all of
11
12 the region ventral to the confluence of these two depressions (Figure 3C, 5C, pf).
13
14 This notch marks the border between the otic capsule and the occipital region,
15
16 through which passed the perilymphatic duct. The notch is, however, too large to be
17
18
19
considered only the lateral border of the perilymphatic foramen, and it may have
20
21 housed other structures such as part of the perilymphatic sac (see inner ear and
22
23 discussion sections below).
24
25
26
27 Prootic
28
29
30 The prootic forms the lateral wall of the braincase posterior to the
31
32 laterosphenoid and anterior to the fenestra ovalis (Figures 1E, F, 2E, F, pro).
33
34 Posterolaterally the prootic extends onto the anterior surface of the paroccipital
35
36 process in a laterally tapering sheet that reaches to just under half way along the
37
38
39
paroccipital process (Figure 1A, E, F). Anteriorly, the prootic contacts the
40
41 laterosphenoid, and forms the dorsal, posterior and ventral margins of the large
42
43 foramen for the trigeminal nerve (CN V), with the laterosphenoid forming the anterior
44
45 margin. The CN V foramen (Figure 1F, CN V) is oval, with its long axis extending
46
47 posteroventrally to anterodorsally. The anterodorsal extremity of the prootic forms the
48
49
50 ventral floor of a recess (Figures 1A, C, E, F, 3A, 5B, D, vcd) which was roofed by the
51
52 supraoccipital dorsomedially and, when in articulation, by the parietal dorsolaterally.
53
54 The laterosphenoid may have formed the anterior wall of this channel, though it is
55
56 disarticulated in all specimens. The smooth and rounded nature of this recess, and
57
58
59
the relationships of the cited elements as seen in other taxa suggest that it was not
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 18 of 103
1
2
3 simply an articulation for the parietal and/or laterosphenoid, but a channel for the
4
5 vena capitis dorsalis [56, 58–60], which would have connected the braincase cavity
6
7 with the temporal region. In the CT scans of SAM-PK-5867, whether such a channel
8
9
10 is present is difficult to assess, but there does appear to be a rounded opening which
11
12 may represent its lateral extreme (Figure 11B). A corresponding structure identified
13
14 as a venous sinus is found on the supraoccipital of Osmolskina czatkowicensis [61].
15
16 Immediately posterior to the lateral part of this recess is a small posterolaterally
17
18
19
directed depression with marked borders which appears to have been a facet for the
20
21 parietal (Figure 5A, fc.pa).
22
23 Posteroventral to the foramen for CN V, the prootic is slightly depressed,
24
25 indicating the position of a gasserian ganglion external to the brain cavity (Figures
26
27 1E, F, 2E, F, ggf). A sharp crest (here referred to as crest 1, to avoid terminological
28
29
30 confusion) extends ventrally down from the paroccipital process (Figure 2E, cr1),
31
32 forming the anterior margin of the stapedial groove and then, ventral to the dorsal
33
34 margin of the fenestra ovalis, the anterior margin of the groove for the hyomandibular
35
36 branch of CN VII (CN VIIhym, Figure 1E). A lower crest (crest 2; Figure 2E, cr2)
37
38
39
originates from this crest at the dorsal margin of the fenestra ovalis, and forms the
40
41 posterior margin of the dorsalmost part of the groove for CN VIIhym and then the
42
43 anterior margin of the fenestra ovalis. Crest 1 becomes much lower and arcs
44
45 anteriorly then posteriorly again just below the exit for CN VII, before descending
46
47 directly ventrally and approaching the posterior wall of the groove for the palatal
48
49
50 branch of CN VII (CN VIIpal). Further ventrally still, the wall of the groove for CN VIIpal
51
52 and crest 1 diverge once again below to form the posterior and anterior margins of
53
54 the lateral depression, respectively. A bulging ridge marking the path of the lateral
55
56 semicircular canal follows the line of crest 1 dorsal to the foramen for CN VII, but is
57
58
59
inset anterodorsally from the crest. Once it reaches a point level with the foramen for
60

1
2
3 CN VII, this ridge curves sharply anterodorsally, bordering the dorsal margin of the
4
5 depression for the gasserian ganglion (Figure 2E). In lateral view, the posterior
6
7 surface of the prootic forming the anterior border of the fenestra ovalis of SAM-PK-
8
9
10 7696 bears a lagenar crest (Figure 5A, B, lg.cr), a smoothly rounded protuberance
11
12 that marks the division of the vestibular and cochlear regions of the inner ear.
13
14 The medial wall of the prootic possesses a large, round and very deeply
15
16 marked fossa immediately dorsal and a short distance posterior to the foramen for
17
18
19
CN V - the floccular fossa (= fossa subarcuata, auricular fossa; Figure 1A, 3A, B, ff).
20
21 The posterior wall of the fossa has a marked, deeper subregion that seems to enter
22
23 the bone but does not lead off within it. Ventral to the floccular fossa, the left foramen
24
25 for CN V is separated from the inner ear by an elevated and rounded ridge (Figures
26
27 5B, 4, rd). Posterior to this ridge, close to its base, there seems to be a dorsoventral
28
29
30 sulcus, perhaps leading dorsally to the foramen for CN VII or ventrally to the brain
31
32 cavity (Figure 3B, su). The foramen for CN VII is connected to the oval depressions
33
34 (see above) on the anterior third of the braincase floor by a groove (Figure 4,
35
36 cg.ov.VII).
37
38
39
Ventral to the foramen for the trigeminal nerve, the prootic projects as a thin
40
41 process – the anterior inferior process (Figure 2E, aip). The left and right processes
42
43 are connected by a sheet of bone, the dorsum sellae (Figure 2A, ds). The dorsum
44
45 sellae is bordered laterally by ridges, which connect ventrally to the protruded
46
47 margins of the clinoid processes (Figure 2A, ri; see parabasisphenoid). The middle
48
49
50 third of the dorsal margin of the dorsum sellae dips ventrally to the midline, thus
51
52 forming a V-shape in anterior view (Figure 1A). The dorsum sellae forms the dorsal
53
54 rim of the foramen of the abducens nerve (Figure 2A, CN VI), and is directed
55
56 anteroventrally rather than anteriorly, unlike, for example, in Erythorosuchus
57
58
59
africanus [62]. On the dorsal part of the lateral surface of the anterior inferior process,
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 20 of 103
1
2
3 immediately ventral to the trigeminal opening, is a low, very slight anteroposteriorly
4
5 extending narrow ridge (Figure 2F, ri); it is less pronounced than in Dorosuchus
6
7 neoetus (PIN 1579/62), and is perhaps better described as a thickening of the bone
8
9
10 along the margin of the trigeminal foramen rather than a true ridge.
11
12
13
14 Supraoccipital
15
16 The supraoccipital is a broad, flat element that forms the posterodorsal part of
17
18
19
the roof of the braincase and forms the medial third of the dorsal border of the
20
21 foramen magnum (Figures 1B, C, 2, 7B, 9C, 11B, so). The supraoccipital partially
22
23 housed the common crus, the posterior portion of the anterior semicircular canal and
24
25 the anterior part of the posterior semicircular canal.
26
27 Laterally and posterolaterally, the supraoccipital contacts the opisthotics. The
28
29
30 entire line of this suture is unclear in SAM-PK-7696. In SAM-PK-5867 however, in
31
32 dorsal view, this suture extends in a laterally concave arc from the lateral margin of
33
34 the contact between the exoccipital and the supraoccipital at the lateral margin of the
35
36 foramen magnum to the anteromedial margin of the paroccipital process (Figure
37
38
39
11B). Anterior to the end of this suture, the supraoccipital contacts the prootic along
40
41 the dorsolateral extreme of the braincase (Figures 2E, F, 11B). The suture line could
42
43 not be identified in SAM-PK-7696, but in SAM-PK-5867 it describes a gentle,
44
45 medially concave arc from the lateralmost point of the suture between supraoccipital
46
47 and opisthotic to the anterior border of the supraoccipital, at the dorsomedial corner
48
49
50 of the recess of the vena capitis dorsalis (Figure 11B, vcd). The lateral part of the
51
52 dorsal margin of the supraoccipital thus forms the medial and posterior margins of the
53
54 recess (see Prootic above), which is anteriorly and dorsally open; immediately medial
55
56 to this, the supraoccipital also roofs the medial section of this hollow.

3 In posterior view (Figure 11B) the dorsal margin of the supraoccipital is raised
4
5 into a convexity at the midline and into another, smaller convexity laterally on either
6
7 side. Gentle ridges or raised strips extend back from each of these convexities
8
9
10 (Figure 11B, ridges), with those extending from the lateral convexities moving
11
12 towards the midline posteriorly (Figure 11B); all three of these ridges disappear
13
14 around half way to the border of the foramen magnum.

19
Laterosphenoid
20
21 In SAM-PK-5867, the braincase wall anterior to the prootic is fully ossified as
22
23 the laterosphenoid, although disarticulated from the remainder of the braincase
24
25 (Figure 15), indicating that it may not have been firmly sutured in life. In SAM-PK-
26
27 5867, the laterosphenoid is displaced anteriorly and (probably associated with the
28
29
30 lateral compression of the specimen seen on its left side) greatly tilted to the right in
31
32 relation to the occipital area of the skull, so it is visible in dorsal view through the right
33
34 orbit (Figures 15, 17A). A single disarticulated bone identified as a right
35
36 laterosphenoid has been described from SAM-PK-7696 (Clark et al. 1993); we find
37
38
39
that whether this is indeed a laterosphenoid (and/or the same ossification of the
40
41 anterior braincase wall as preserved in SAM-PK-5867) is difficult to assess.
42
43 Fragments of bone were attributed to the laterosphenoid in UMZC T.692 [43, 63] and
44
45 this attribution is confirmed by CT scans, but their poor preservation prevents
46
47 morphological information bring obtained from them. The laterosphenoid of SAM-PK-
48
49
50 6047A is missing entirely. The presence of a laterosphenoid was noted by Clark et al.
51
52 [63] for SAM-PK-5867, but that specimen was not fully prepared at that time to allow
53
54 a more complete description. Although we agree with these authors on the
55
56 identification of this structure as a laterosphenoid, we note some differences to the
57
58
59
laterosphenoid of extant crocodilians, potentially indicating presence of more
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 22 of 103
1
2
3 elements (fused together) in Euparkeria than the “true” laterosphenoid (see below).
4
5 Irrespective of homology, the laterosphenoid of Euparkeria will be described here as
6
7 a single element. The description is based on the right side of the laterosphenoid of
8
9
10 SAM-PK-5867, unless stated otherwise, as this is more clearly visible both visually
11
12 and in the CT scans.
13
14 The laterosphenoid of Euparkeria is fundamentally similar to that of
15
16 Proterosuchus alexanderi (NMQR 1484), but less anteroposteriorly elongated, and its
17
18
19
anterior part is more ventrally extended (Figure 15B, C). In dorsal view, the posterior
20
21 part of the dorsal rim extends straight anteriorly, then bends sharply anterolaterally to
22
23 form the posterior part of the capitate process, and then curves smoothly
24
25 anteromedially again (Figure 15A). In lateral view (Figure 15B), the dorsal half of the
26
27 posterior margin of the laterosphenoid is convexly rounded. Although it shows a
28
29
30 subtle projection, it has no posteriorly extending process as developed as that seen
31
32 in Proterosuchus [63]. The dorsal half of the posterior margin of the laterosphenoid is
33
34 separated from the ventral half by a notch, which forms the anterior rim of the
35
36 foramen for CN V (Figure 15B, CN V). The border of this notch is depressed laterally,
37
38
39
as seen in the prootic, marking the position of the Gasserian ganglion. The ventral
40
41 half of the posterior margin of the laterosphenoid is still in articulation with the anterior
42
43 inferior process of the prootic (Figure 9A, 15B, C); the laterosphenoid does not
44
45 extend below the articulation with the prootic, and would not have contacted the
46
47 parabasisphenoid. The lateral surface of the posterior part of laterosphenoid is
48
49
50 smooth and delimited anteriorly by two rounded crests: a more dorsal crest, the
51
52 laterosphenoid buttress (=cotylar crest of Clark et al. [63]; Figure 15 B, C, ls.bt), and
53
54 a more ventral crest, the tensor crest (sensu Holliday & Witmer [64]; Figure 15B, C,
55
56 tc).

3 The laterosphenoid buttress curves first anteroventrally and then
4
5 posteroventrally from the capitate process (Figure 15, cp) to form an anteriorly
6
7 convex outline with the tensor crest. Both structures, however, do not contact each
8
9
10 other, leaving a space between them flush with the lateral surface of the
11
12 laterosphenoid, at about its midheight. The capitate process (= postorbital process of
13
14 Holliday & Witmer [64]:718; Figure 15, cp) is very robust in comparison to the rest of
15
16 the laterosphenoid, and protrudes from the main body of the laterosphenoid laterally.
17
18
19
The tensor crest (Figure 15B, C, tc) of Euparkeria is very well marked compared to
20
21 that of Proterosuchus, where it appears to be absent (Clark et al. [63]). Anterior to the
22
23 tensor crest, the laterosphenoid extends as a medially directed process, the
24
25 dorsoventral extension of which is about half that of the tensor crest.
26
27 Anterior to the buttress and to the tensor crest, there is a large opening. The
28
29
30 posterior margin of this opening bears one sharp, distinct anterior projection, just
31
32 ventral to the end of the laterosphenoid buttress. On the right hand side, this
33
34 projection does not appear to reach the anterior margin of the opening, but on the left
35
36 hand side it reaches the anterior margin to form a small foramen dorsal to it. Although
37
38
39
visible in the specimen, the complete bar forming the foramen of the left hand side
40
41 could not be segmented out in the 3D model because, despite having a different
42
43 coloration from the matrix, the densities are not easily distinguishable. This bar would
44
45 represent the separation between the foramina of CN III ventrally from CN IV
46
47 dorsally.
48
49
50 The anteroventral borders of the CN III and IV foramina are formed by the
51
52 slender process. Compared to Proterosuchus (NMQR 1484; Clark et al. [63]), the
53
54 slender process of Euparkeria (Figure 15, sp) is wider and would have been more
55
56 posteriorly directed. The anterodorsal border of the slender process seems to be
57
58
59
slightly notched, probably corresponding to the point of exit of CN II (Figure 15B, C,
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 24 of 103
1
2
3 CN II). No ventral crest that would correspond to that identified in Proterosuchus [63]
4
5 is visible. The lateral surface of the anteriormost region of the laterosphenoid is
6
7 smooth and gently concave. The laterosphenoid tapers dorsoventrally at its
8
9
10 anteriormost end (Figure 15B, C), but, in relation to the width of the slender process,
11
12 it does not extend as far anteriorly as that in Proterosuchus [63].
13
14
15
16 Inner ear
17
18
19
The inner ear (Figure 16) is very well preserved and when the overall size of
20
21 the braincase is taken into account, it is much enlarged (82.44 mm³) when compared
22
23 to that of Youngina capensis (62.69 mm³ [65]; the only non-saurian diapsid for which
24
25 the inner ear is segmented). The fenestra ovalis (Figure 16A, fo) is well defined and
26
27 dorsoventrally elongate when compared to that of Prolacerta ([47], fig. 1) and laterally
28
29
30 it is formed mostly by the prootic anteriorly and the opisthotic posteriorly, with
31
32 participation of the parabasisphenoid ventrally and anteroventrally (Figure 6C). The
33
34 basioccipital also contributes to the posteroventral part of the medial margin (Figure
35
36 6C). The lagenar crests (Figure 5A, B, lg.cr) are situated on the anterior and posterior
37
38
39
borders of the fenestra ovalis, at about its midheight. The lagenar crests mark the
40
41 dorsalmost limit of the lagenar recess and separate the vestibular and cochlear
42
43 regions of the inner ear (Figure 5A, B, lg.cr). The anterior lagenar crest is low and
44
45 rounded, while the posterior one is more prominent and thinner. The ventralmost tip
46
47 of the lagenar recess appears to lie in the “unossified gap” (sensu Gower & Weber
48
49
50 [43]), with the cochlea having passed medial to the bony bar connecting the ventral
51
52 ramus of the opisthotic and the posterodorsal region of the parabasisphenoid, and
53
54 lateral to the braincase floor (Figure 3D, F). The region connecting the otic capsule
55
56 and the occipital region in Euparkeria is marked by a rounded notch on the medial
57
58
59
side of the ventral ramus of the opisthotic (Figure 3; Figure 16E, F, pf). The
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 25 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 perilymphatic duct passed through this notch, likely through its narrowest part. This
4
5 part is located more laterally in comparison to that of Sphenodon (ROM R9298) and
6
7 the duct ran in a more anteroposterior direction in Euparkeria as opposed to
8
9
10 anterolateral to posteromedial in Sphenodon (see discussion below). The notch as a
11
12 whole is too large to have housed the perilymphatic duct alone. Thus, the
13
14 perilymphatic foramen was only partially laterally surrounded by bone (see
15
16 Opisthotic).
17
18
19
The semicircular canals (Figure 15A–D) are of roughly the same length as one
20
21 another. The posteroventral part of the vestibule is not enclosed by bone, in part
22
23 because of the elongated fenestra ovalis, and medially the internal auditory meatus is
24
25 largely unossified. The anterior semicircular canal exits the anterior ampulla anteriorly
26
27 and slightly laterally (Figure 16, asc), extending immediately dorsally and posteriorly,
28
29
30 and then medially, around the floccular fossa, entering the common crus
31
32 anterodorsally. Only the dorsalmost part of the common crus is surrounded by bone
33
34 (Figure 16E, F, cc), but its ventral connection to the utriculus is marked by a groove
35
36 on the right medial wall of the braincase (Figure 3A, gr.ut), allowing its course to be
37
38
39
reconstructed. The anterior and posterior semicircular canals meet at approximately
40
41 the midlength of the vestibule (Figure 16A, asc, psc), but the common crus enters the
42
43 utriculus just anterior to the dorsal rim of the fenestra ovalis, extending ventrally and
44
45 posteriorly. The posterior semicircular canal leaves the posterior portion of the
46
47 vestibule dorsolaterally and extends anteromedially into the common crus. In dorsal
48
49
50 view (Figure 16D), the paths of the anterior and posterior semicircular canals
51
52 describe arches whose concavities face opposite directions. The lateral semicircular
53
54 canal is a little shorter than the other semicircular canals. It leaves the posterolateral
55
56 portion of the anterior ampulla, describing a gentle arc in dorsal view, and enters the
57
58
59
vestibule laterally (Figure 16D).

3 Like the fenestra ovalis, the metotic foramen (Figures 1F, 5C, D, 7B, 16E, F,
4
5 mf) is also dorsoventrally elongate compared to Youngina [65] (fig. 9 – online
6
7 animated version) and Prolacerta [47] (fig. 1). The lateral border of the metotic
8
9
10 foramen is fairly uniform, but the posterior rim of the ventral part of the medial border
11
12 protrudes, so that the foramen is wider at its medial margin ventrally than dorsally.
13
14 The ventral portion comprises more than half of the foramen. The metotic foramen is
15
16 not subdivided into a fenestra pseudorotunda and a vagus foramen and there is also
17
18
19
no indication of an independent exit for the glossopharyngeal nerve, thus it is certain
20
21 that CN X and CN IX exited the braincase through the metotic foramen. The
22
23 accessory nerve (CN XI) and the vena cephalica posterior could have exited the
24
25 braincase through the metotic foramen, or, alternatively, through the faint,
26
27 anteriormost foramen found on the right exocciptal of SAM-PK-7696 (see above;
28
29
30 Figure 5A, ?CN XI) and through the foramen magnum, respectively. The irregular
31
32 medial shape of the metotic foramen potentially indicates the positions of the
33
34 structures housed by, and exiting through, the foramen: the ventral portion is wide
35
36 and rounded in posterolateral view, and likely represents the area where the
37
38
39
perilymphatic sac sat and bulged into – the area corresponding to the recessus
40
41 scalae tympani in taxa where the fenestra pseudorotunda is present. The
42
43 perilymphatic foramen, which connects this area to the lagenar recess, is only
44
45 ossified laterally, as described above. The nerves and the vein would have left dorsal
46
47 to the perilympahtic sac, where the metotic foramen is narrower medially.
48
49
50
51
52 Cranial Nerves & Some Vascular Elements
53
54 The optic nerve (CN II) would have entered the braincase anteromedially
55
56 through either a single foramen or through separate foramina for the right and left
57
58
59
nerves. The laterosphenoid of Euparkeria is fairly well preserved, thus the absence of
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 27 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 any medial structure, or indication thereof, seems to indicate that the CN II left the
4
5 braincase through a single medial foramen (Figure 16B, C, CN II), similar to the
6
7 situation in Proterosuchus [63]. The oculomotor (CN III) and trochlear (CN IV) nerves
8
9
10 are closely related motor nerves that may have confluent foramina in some archosaur
11
12 clades [66], with the CN III lying ventral to the CN IV. The nerves in Euparkeria, like in
13
14 Proterosuchus [63], had separate foramina (Figure 16B, C, CNIII, CNIV), but the
15
16 ventrolateral border of the foramen for CN III in Euparkeria seems to have been more
17
18
19
complete than in Proterosuchus. This is indicated by the presence of a small
20
21 projection of the laterosphenoid (Figure 15C) absent in Proterosuchus.
22
23 The trigeminal nerve (CN V) innervates a diverse group of tissues and
24
25 muscles that include the regions of the nose, mouth, facial skin, cornea, teeth, palate,
26
27 and pharynx, among others, and is, therefore, the largest of the cranial nerves [64]. In
28
29
30 Euparkeria, the margin of its foramen is formed by the prootic (Figure 1F, CN V),
31
32 except for the anterodorsal border, which was formed by the laterosphenoid (Figure
33
34 15, CN V). The lateral surface of the prootic bordering the posterior region of the
35
36 foramen is gently depressed, indicating the external position of the Gasserian
37
38
39
ganglion in relation to the brain cavity (Figure 2E, ggf). The ventral and anteroventral
40
41 borders of the trigeminal foramen are formed by the ossification of part of the base of
42
43 the embryonic pila antotica – the anterior inferior process of the prootic (Figure 2E,
44
45 aip).
46
47 As the suture between prootic and parabsisphenoid extends through the
48
49
50 foramina for the abducens nerve (CN VI), the prootic and parabasisphenoid thus form
51
52 the laterodorsal and ventromedial borders of these foramina, respectively (Figure 2A,
53
54 CN VI). The foramina for CN VI are located on the dorsum sellae, near its lateral
55
56 margin at about its midheight. The lateral borders of the foramina are partially
57
58
59
concealed in anterior view by the clinoid processes of the parabasisphenoid.

3 On the right hand side of SAM-PK-7696 the foramen for the facial nerve (CN
4
5 VII) is largely concealed by crest 1 of the prootic (Figure 1E, cr1). On the left hand
6
7 side, crest 1 does not obscure the foramen (there appears to have been post-mortem
8
9
10 distortion on the right hand side) but the foramen sits in a groove formed by crest 1
11
12 anteriorly (Figure 1F, CN VII; also seen on SAM-PK-5867 – Figure 9C). This groove
13
14 extends dorsally and ventrally, marking the routes of the hyomandibular (Figure 2E,
15
16 CN VIIhym) and palatine (Figures 2E, 11C, CN VIIpal) branches of CN VII, respectively.
17
18
19
As described above, the hyomandibular branch of the facial nerve would have left the
20
21 braincase from the posterodorsal part of the foramen, and continued posterodorsally
22
23 towards the base of the paroccipital process, whereas the palatine branch would
24
25 have exited the ventral part of the foramen, and extended ventrally and then medially
26
27 along the posterior margin of the basipterygoid process [47, 54–56].
28
29
30 As the medial wall of the otic capsule is mostly unossified, there are no
31
32 foramina for the branches of the auditory nerve (CN VIII). The glossopharyngeal (CN
33
34 IX), vagus (CN X), and likely also the accessory (CN XI) nerves exited the braincase
35
36 through the metotic foramen (Figures 1E, F; 3A, F; 6; 7B; 11A, B; 12B, mf). The
37
38
39
presence of a shallow recess that closely resembles a foramen on the right hand side
40
41 of SAM-PK-7696 may indicate a separate and independent route for the CN XI
42
43 (Figure 5A, ?CN XI). The dorsal portion of the metotic foramen is somewhat narrower
44
45 than its ventral portion, and the cranial nerves would have left the brain cavity
46
47 through the former, while the perilymphatic sac would have been sited on the latter.
48
49
50 In squamates, the anterior branch of the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) has
51
52 smaller fibres and innervates the tongue, whereas the posterior branch is
53
54 morphologically very similar to the first and second spinal nerves [55, 67]. The
55
56 hypoglossal nerve may leave the braincase as a single ramus, in which case the
57
58
59
exoccipital is pierced by only one foramen. However, the presence of two
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 29 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 independent foramina (Figure 6A, CN XIIa, CN XIIp) indicates that the divergence
4
5 between the branches took place before the CN XII exited the braincase in
6
7 Euparkeria.
8
9
10 Foramina for the ethmoidal and ophthalmic arteries were found in
11
12 Proterosuchus [63], but no similar structures could be identified in Euparkeria,
13
14 possibly due to the poorer preservation of the laterosphenoid. The vidian canals are
15
16 preserved in all specimens of Euparkeria except SAM-PK-7696. The canals are not
17
18
19
well preserved in any of the specimens although it is possible to verify that they make
20
21 a simple connection with the hypophyseal fossa, perforating the basisphenoid
22
23 ventrally (Figure 11A, 12F, ica), posteromedial to the bases of the basipterygoid
24
25 processes, and extending anterodorsally into the fossa. The vena capitis dorsalis
26
27 exited the brain cavity through a foramen located between the prootic, supraoccipital,
28
29
30 parietal, and laterosphenoid (Figure 1A, C, 3A, 5B, D, 11B, vcd).

33
34 DISCUSSION
35
36 In the light of the new data provided by CT scanning, and re-examination of all
37
38
39
available material of Euparkeria, it is now possible to clarify a number of points of
40
41 uncertainty remaining from previous studies regarding the braincase anatomy of
42
43 Euparkeria. We thus address these points, roughly in the morphological order of
44
45 description used above, in the discussion. Additionally, we examine and discuss
46
47 Euparkeria in the broader context of diapsid braincase evolution, with our
48
49
50 understanding again facilitated by the new data available to us. Furthermore, we
51
52 suggest new directions for future studies of archosauriform and diapsid evolution.

3 Basioccipital – The basioccipital of Euparkeria was described by Gower &
4
5 Weber [43] as contributing to the basal tubera with “relatively long and slender” ([43],
6
7 p.373) projecting tongues of bone in comparison to “other earliest archosaurs” ([43],
8
9
10 p.373). Examination of SAM-PK-5867 (Figures 7B, 11A), however, shows that whilst
11
12 the occiput of Euparkeria is overall more gracile than those of other crownward
13
14 archosauriforms, the basal tubera nonetheless have similar proportions to that of, for
15
16 instance, Xilousuchus sapingensis [51]. The basal tubera of Xilousuchus were
17
18
19
described as similar to those of Garjainia prima and Fugusuchus hejiapensis, which,
20
21 in turn, were considered “small, simple and ventrally projecting” ([51], p.884) and
22
23 “broad, flat, and simple” ([51], p.889) ventral projections respectively. Nesbitt [29]
24
25 introduced a new character describing the nature of the anteroposterior thickness of
26
27 the basioccipital portions of the basal tubera (character 106), in which non-
28
29
30 pseudosuchian archosauriforms including Euparkeria show basal tubera which are
31
32 “rounded and anteroposteriorly elongated” ([29], p. 89; state 0, contrasting with the
33
34 “bladelike and anteroposteriorly shortened” basal tubera of some crocodile-line taxa).
35
36 We agree with the scoring of Nesbitt [29] and find that the basal tubera of Euparkeria
37
38
39
cannot be described as exceptionally long and slender among stem and early
40
41 archosarus either in lateral or posterior view.
42
43
44
45 Parabasisphenoid – Welman [48] labelled the cerebral branch of the internal
46
47 carotid artery as extending into the parabasisphenoid through foramina located in the
48
49
50 semilunar depression. As indicated in the previous section, the entrance foramina of
51
52 the artery are located on the ventral surface of the bone, posteromedial to the base
53
54 of the basipterygoid processes (Figures 11A, 14F, ica). This is in agreement with the
55
56 scoring of character 95 of Euparkeria in Nesbitt [29]. Welman [48] also stated that the
57
58
59
basipterygoid processes of Euparkeria are more similar in shape to those of
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 31 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 palaeognath birds than to those of dinosauromorphs and pseudosuchians. We found
4
5 it difficult to assess this statement as little explanation of exactly what is regarded as
6
7 similar is provided. However, the basipterygoid processes of Euparkeria have little
8
9
10 particular resemblance with those of palaeognath birds. The processes of Struthio
11
12 camelus (ZMB 2000 2769), with which Welman [48] made extensive comparisons,
13
14 are short and laterally orientated (Figure 20A, bt). They are highly pneumatic and
15
16 anteroposteriorly elongated in cross section, with the long axis directed slightly
17
18
19
ventrally. This general morphology is in fact quite similar to that of Sphenosuchus
20
21 acutus [68], while the processes of Coelophysis bauri [29] are also small and
22
23 anteroposteriorly elongate, but ventrally orientated and with their long axes dorsally
24
25 directed.
26
27 The route of the suture line between the prootic and parabasisphenoid
28
29
30 described above contrasts with that described by Cruickshank [46], who indicated
31
32 that the parabasisphenoid formed part of the posterior margin of the fenestra ovalis
33
34 (a “small posteriormost process in front of the ventral ramus of the opisthotic” – [46],
35
36 p. 684) and a large part of its anterior margin. The suture between the prootic and the
37
38
39
parabasisphenoid was identified in the CT scans as extending directly
40
41 posterodorsally to anteroventrally from the anteroventral margin of the fenestra ovalis
42
43 (Figures 3E, 6C). However, the basisphenoid does have a small dorsal process
44
45 laterally that forms the anteroventral border of the fenestra ovalis (Figure 2E, dp.bs).
46
47 The suture identified by Cruickshank [46] is in fact the groove for the palatal branch
48
49
50 of CN VII, and the “posteriormost process” indicated by Cruickshank is absent. Ewer
51
52 [15] indicated the parabasisphenoid-prootic suture line broadly correctly, with the
53
54 parabasisphenoid ascending dorsally as a short posterior process anterior to the
55
56 fenestra ovalis, then descending again along the groove for CN VII. Gower & Weber
57
58
59
[43] excluded the dorsal process of the parabasisphenoid that contributes to the
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 32 of 103
1
2
3 fenestra ovalis from that element entirely, indicating the prootic-parabasisphenoid
4
5 suture line as extending anteroposteriorly; the posterior portion of the line indicated
6
7 by Gower & Weber [43] is likely a crack, with the fragment of bone immediately
8
9
10 dorsal to this crack also being part of the parabasisphenoid; it is also possible to
11
12 identify the ascending process of the parabasisphenoid on the left side of SAM-PK-
13
14 5867. A tall posterior ascending process of the parabasisphenoid was depicted by
15
16 Dzik [69] in the braincase of Silesaurus. Upon examination of the relevant
17
18
19
specimens, however, it is difficult to verify exactly the contribution of the
20
21 parabasisphenoid to the fenestra ovalis. On the right hand side of ZPAL Ab III/364 the
22
23 process seems robust and tall, but on the left side it is was not found. There are no
24
25 signs of processes on a second Silesaurus specimen, ZPAL Ab III/361. Stagonolepis
26
27 olenkae (ZPAL AbIII/466/17, right hand side) also shows the parabasisphenoid
28
29
30 participating in the anteroventral border of the fenestra ovalis, but the prootic-
31
32 parabasisphenoid suture is difficult to follow anterior to this and an ascending
33
34 process may have been absent.
35
36 We confirm the statement of Gower & Weber [43] that the lateral depression is
37
38
39
formed entirely by the parabasisphenoid (Figure 3E) and there is no participation of
40
41 another element, such as the alaparasphenoid [48] or the prootic [47]. We also
42
43 confirm that the lateral depression is not connected to any cavity within the
44
45 parabasisphenoid itself or within the basioccipital. This is confirmed not only upon
46
47 examination of SAM-PK-7696, but also of SAM-PK-5867 and UMZC T.692, and is
48
49
50 thus not a result, as suggested by Gower & Weber [43], of individual variation.
51
52 However, the braincase as a whole is lightly constructed; whilst this is exaggerated to
53
54 some extent in SAM-PK-7696 due to acid preparation, the entire braincase is formed
55
56 of trabeculate bone. In UMZC T692 and SAM-PK-6047A, the preserved parts of the
57
58
59
basipterygoid processes appear hollow in the CT scans; this may be either because
60

Page 33 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 the delicate trabeculae were damaged or because the scan made was not sensitive
4
5 enough to detect them. We were not able to locate any foramen or channel
6
7 connecting these or other internal spaces to the outside (see below). With the
8
9
10 reevaluation of the dorsal extent of the parabasisphenoid and its subsequent
11
12 contribution to the anterior part of the lateral braincase wall, our perception of the
13
14 roles of the parabsisphenoid and prootic is also altered and is discussed below.
15
16 Other aspects of the lateral depression and of potentially pneumatic features, such as
17
18
19
its homologous nature with the anterior tympanic recess, will also be discussed
20
21 below.
22
23 Scans of SAM-PK-5867 and of the Cambridge specimen UMZC T.692 confirm
24
25 the conclusions of Gower & Weber [43] that Euparkeria possesses no intertuberal
26
27 plate, contrary to Nesbitt [29], who scores the intertuberal plate as present and
28
29
30 arched anteriorly. The anterior border of the medial pharyngeal recess of Euparkeria
31
32 is, however arched, and we thus suppose Nesbitt [29] must have mistaken this
33
34 border for an intertuberal plate; the intertuberal plate of some taxa, e.g.
35
36 Arizonasaurus (see [70]), is indeed both present and arched anteriorly, but the
37
38
39
distribution of this morphology is much more restricted than indicated by Nesbitt [29].
40
41
42
43 Exoccipital – Gower & Weber [43] tentatively described the exoccipitals as not
44
45 contacting medially. This was reconsidered in Gower [57], and based on the scoring
46
47 of this character for Euparkeria, Nesbitt [29] (p. 91) stated that “[p]lesiomorphically
48
49
50 among archosauriforms, the exoccipitals meet along the midline preventing the
51
52 basioccipital from participating in the endocranial cavity”, also scoring Euparkeria as
53
54 having contacting exoccipitals. By tracing the suture lines in CT data we can confirm
55
56 that the exoccipitals did not meet at the midline in SAM-PK-7696, with the ventral
57
58
59
border of the foramen magnum thus formed by the basioccipital (Figure 6A). In SAM-
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 34 of 103
1
2
3 PK-5867, the exoccipitals also do not meet, but they approach each other more than
4
5 in SAM-PK-7696 (Figure 7B), and we consider this to be the result of the lateral
6
7 compression suffered by the specimen. In UMZC T.692, however, the right exoccipital
8
9
10 extends further medially than in SAM-PK-5867 and almost reaches the midline
11
12 (Figure 15B), but does not contact its antimere. We can also confirm that there are
13
14 two foramina for CN XII in both SAM-PK-7696 and SAM-PK-5867, with a third
15
16 foramen in the region of SAM-PK-7696 potentially attributable to CN XI (Figure 5A).
17
18
19
We agree with Gower & Weber [43] that CN X would have left the braincase via the
20
21 metotic foramen as in all modern amniotes without a proper vagus foramen, contra
22
23 Ewer [15], who identified the upper portion of the CN XII foramina as being for CN X.
24
25
26
27 Opisthotic – The suture between opisthotic and exoccipital was identified with
28
29
30 the assistance of CT scans (Figure 6A), and it can be confirmed that the exoccipital is
31
32 restricted to the pillar between the metotic foramen and the foramen magnum, not
33
34 participating in the paroccipital process. We can confirm that Cruickshank [46] and
35
36 Welman [48] were correct in their identification of a delicate bony bridge connecting
37
38
39
the distal end of the ventral ramus of the opisthotic and the parabasisphenoid on the
40
41 right hand side of SAM-PK-7696 (Figures 3D, 11B, bd.bn). We also identify this
42
43 feature on the right hand side in SAM-PK-5867 (Figure 9B, bd.bn). Damage prevents
44
45 its identification on the left hand side in both specimens and in UMZC T.692 (see
46
47 below).
48
49
50
51
52 Prootic – Gower & Sennikov [51] reported a small ridge on the anterior inferior
53
54 process of the prootic of Euparkeria, but further examination of UMZC T.692 led
55
56 Gower & Weber [43] to reidentify it as a preservational artifact and to consider the
57
58
59
ridge absent in Euparkeria. The absence of such a ridge was also identified by
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 35 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 Nesbitt [29] as a synapormorphy of Archosauria (character 94). We confirm however
4
5 that the ridge is indeed present in Euparkeria in SAM-PK-7696 (Figure 2F, ri) and on
6
7 the left hand side of SAM-PK-5867 (although poorly preserved; damage prevents
8
9
10 accurate assessment in UMZC T.692 and in SAM-PK-6047A the prootic is not
11
12 preserved) and marks the ventral edge of the depression for the Gasserian ganglion.
13
14 Such a ridge also forms part of the raised border of the depression for the Gasserian
15
16 ganglion in other archosauriforms (e.g. Trilophosaurus buettneri [71]) and in most
17
18
19
achosaur taxa where the entire border of the trigeminal foramen is well known, e.g.
20
21 Dysalotosaurus lettowvorbecki [56], Stagonolepis olenkae (ZPAL AbIII/466/17) and
22
23 Adeopapposaurus mognai (PVSJ 568). We also disagree that this feature is absent
24
25 in Erythrosuchus africanus (BP/1/3893; contra [29, 62]), although the ridge is much
26
27 less prominent than in crown taxa. The phylogenetic informativeness of this feature is
28
29
30 thus, in our opinion, doubtful.
31
32 Two separate foramina for the palatine and hyomandibular branches of the
33
34 facial nerve were identified first by Ewer [15], and this was followed by Cruickshank
35
36 [46]. We agree with Gower and Weber [43] that only one foramen is present in UMZC
37
38
39
T.692, and could also identify only one opening for CN VII in SAM-PK-7696 (Figure
40
41 1E, F; 3B, E) and on the left hand side of SAM-PK-5867 (the right hand side is too
42
43 damaged for assessment). As correctly noted by Gower & Weber [43], the area
44
45 identified as housing the palatine foramen by Ewer [15] and Cruickshank [46] is
46
47 simply a blind depressed area on the lateral surface of the parabasisphenoid.
48
49
50 Separate foramina for the hyomandibular and palatine branches of the facial nerve
51
52 are not found with certainty in any taxa outside Theropoda, and it appears safe to
53
54 state that such a separation did not occur until much later in archosaurian
55
56 evolutionary history, and that there is no individual variation in Euparkeria (contra the
57
58
59
suggestion of Gower & Weber [43]).

4
5 Supraoccipital – Gower & Weber [43] (p.379) stated that “[i]f the medial suture
6
7 between the prootic and supraoccipital has been correctly identified, then the
8
9
10 posterodorsal end of the floccular recess just extends onto the supraoccipital on the
11
12 left of UMZC T.692, and the broken surface exposed above the recess on the right
13
14 side represents the prootic surface for articulation with the supraoccipital”. We
15
16 disagree that the floccular fossa extends onto the supraoccipital, but we agree that
17
18
19
the suture between prootic and supraoccipital should extend just dorsal to the recess.
20
21 We also find it difficult to understand how, if the floccular fossa extends dorsally onto
22
23 the supraoccipital, the articular surface of the prootic would be exposed dorsal to the
24
25 recess. Gower & Weber [43] also state that “[a] shallow groove on the left side
26
27 immediately anterior to the floccular recess (Figure 9) is interpreted as indicating the
28
29
30 probable path of the middle cerebral vein.” What we identify as the hollow for the
31
32 transverse sinus, more than the middle cerebral vein itself (see above), is not
33
34 preserved in UMZC T.692. The area indicated by Gower & Weber [43] instead
35
36 corresponds to the anterior part of the subarcuate fossa which has been
37
38
39
anteroposteriorly compressed, creating the appearance of a shallow groove.
40
41 Welman [48] identified an epiotic bone anterior to the dorsal part of the base of
42
43 the paroccipital processes in both in SAM-PK-5867 and SAM-PK-7696, though only
44
45 indicated the suture between it and the opisthotic and prootic in the latter. We can
46
47 find no evidence for a separate ossification in this region both using CT data and on
48
49
50 reexamination of the specimens. The anterolateral margins of the supraoccipital in
51
52 SAM-PK-5867 appear to be more rounded and extended than in SAM-PK-7696, and
53
54 this could be potentially indicative of an ossification separate from the supraoccipital
55
56 in this position that is absent in SAM-PK-7696. However, we can find no sutural
57
58
59
distinction between these areas of the skull roof and the rest of the supraoccipital in
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 37 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 SAM-PK-5867, and these differences in shape may be more readily explained by
4
5 mediolateral compression and the articulation with the interparietal and parietal in
6
7 SAM-PK-5867. We thus find no good evidence for the existence of a separate epiotic
8
9
10 in Euparkeria capensis.
11
12
13
14 Fenestra Ovalis and Metotic Foramen – Welman [48] used the size of the
15
16 fenestra ovalis as a synapormorphy uniting Euparkeria and birds with the exclusion of
17
18
19
dinosaurs. We agree with Gower & Weber [43] that, without quantification of “large”
20
21 or “small”, it is difficult to compare the state in Euparkeria with that in other taxa. Taxa
22
23 on both the archosaur stem – e.g. Mesosuchus browni (SAM-PK-6536) – and on the
24
25 crocodile line – e.g. Stagonolepis olenkae (ZPAL AbIII/466/17) - show a fenestra
26
27 ovalis just as extensive as that of Euparkeria, and we find Welman’s [48] conclusions
28
29
30 thus doubtful. We also agree with Gower & Weber [43] that there is no fenestra
31
32 pseudorotunda, rather only an unsubdivided metotic foramen. There is thus no
33
34 metotic strut – the structure which would subdivide the foramen [43, 52], formed from
35
36 the metotic cartilage and separating CN IX from CN X [73]. Although neither feature
37
38
39
is present in Euparkeria, we also wish to point out that the metotic strut is a distinct
40
41 feature from the lateral ridge of the exoccipital (which separates CN XIIa from CN
42
43 XIIp), contra Nesbitt [29].
44
45 Character 114 of Nesbitt [29] synonymizes the lateral ridge of the exoccipital of
46
47 Gower [57] with the metotic strut of theropods. There is, however, a misuse of the
48
49
50 term “metotic strut” here. The term seems to have been introduced in fossil avialan
51
52 literature by Witmer [72] to refer to the ossification of the metotic cartilage, a structure
53
54 related to the formation of the recessus scala tympani and located between the
55
56 nerves glossopharyngeal (CN IX) and vagus (CN X) [73]. Since the lateral ridge of
57
58
59
the exoccipital is, in turn, related to the anterior and posterior branches of the
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 38 of 103
1
2
3 hypoglossal (CN XII) nerve, these structures cannot possibly be related. It is out of
4
5 the scope of this work to find out where and in which context this misunderstanding
6
7 came to being, just as it is not our intention to infer whether or not a lateral ridge on
8
9
10 the exoccipital of pseudosuchians and a lateral ridge on the exoccipital that is called
11
12 metotic strut in theropods are homologous. We simply point out the potential for
13
14 confusion regarding this term. Gower [57] was very aware of the developmental
15
16 context in which the term “metotic strut” was coined and used, for it had been part of
17
18
19
the base of the argument of Gower & Weber [43] (section 3a-V ) for the absence of a
20
21 fenestra pseudorotunda in Euparkeria.
22
23
24
25 Inner Ear – We are also able to shed clarity on several aspects of the anatomy
26
27 of the inner ear. Gower & Weber [43] (p. 389) states that “there is no clearly ossified
28
29
30 differentiation between the canalicular and cochlear parts of the inner ear” in UMZC
31
32 T.692, but we do find a lagenar crest to be present in SAM-PK-7696 (Figure 5A, B).
33
34 However, we agree with Gower & Weber [43] that evidence regarding shape of the
35
36 cochlea is inconclusive. The otic capsule of diapsids is not extensively ossified as in
37
38
39
mammals [74], and thus the exact shape and length of the cochlea cannot be
40
41 indirectly assessed by the osteology alone, and Euparkeria is no exception. We also
42
43 agree with Gower & Weber [43] (p.389) that “part of the anteroventral limit of the
44
45 vestibule can be detected in Euparkeria as a subhorizontal ridge in UMZC T.692, on
46
47 the medial surface of the braincase immediately above the facial foramen”. The
48
49
50 lagenar recess is formed equally by the basioccipital and the basisphenoid medially,
51
52 and thus differs from the description of Welman [48]. Gower & Weber [43] were
53
54 unsure if the unossified gap would indicate the ventralmost part of the lagenar
55
56 recess, but, as we can confirm that it does (see below), the orientation of the cochlea
57
58
59
can be more precisely reconstructed based on the lagenar crests and the unossified
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 39 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 gap as being straight ventral. Nesbitt [29 (character 118) identified Euparkeria as
4
5 having no well-defined lagenar recess. This is however based on Gower [57], which
6
7 is, in turn based on the reluctance of Gower & Weber [43] to identify the unossified
8
9
10 gap as part of the lagenar recess.
11
12 A strong notch on the right medial wall of the opisthotic of SAM-PK-7696 is
13
14 likely an artefact. The surfaces of the ventral ramus of the opisthotic around this
15
16 notch are damaged on both sides, and CT scans show that disarticulated fragments
17
18
19
of bone are attached to them with what appears to be glue (Figure 16E, F). However,
20
21 the ventralmost portion of the medial surface of the ramus does seem to bear a
22
23 gently rounded broad notch, and a similar structure was found on the left hand side
24
25 of SAM-PK-5867. This leads to the conclusion that the lateral border of the
26
27 perilymphatic foramen is identifiable, but it is more ventrally located than the original
28
29
30 area pointed by Gower & Weber [43]. There is definitely no bony medial border,
31
32 similar to the condition in Sphenodon (ROM R9298 – Figure 20). However, several
33
34 differences appear when the structures of Euparkeria and Sphenodon are compared.
35
36 First, the perilymphatic foramen in Euparkeria would be more laterally located.
37
38
39
Second, the dorsal and ventral borders of the foramen in Euparkeria are less
40
41 ossified, while the medial extension of the ramus in Sphenodon is greater. Also, the
42
43 axis of the ventral ramus is slightly twisted in Sphenodon, so that the duct would have
44
45 extended in an anterolateral to posteromedial direction, whereas in Euparkeria it is
46
47 straighter, and the duct extends anteroposteriorly. Finally, in Sphenodon, the ventral
48
49
50 half of the perilymphatic foramen is formed by the basioccipital, while in Euparkeria it
51
52 is formed by the opisthotic. Thus, the position of the perilymphatic foramen identified
53
54 here agrees with the assumption of Gower & Weber [43] that a notch on the medial
55
56 surface of the ventral ramus of the opisthotic represents the lateral half of an
57
58
59
incompletely ossified foramen.

5 Unossified Gap – The open area between the ventralmost tip of the ventral
6
7 ramus of the opisthotic, the anterodorsal part of the basioccipital, and the
8
9
10 posterodorsal region of the parabasisphenoid was identified by Cruickshank [46] as
11
12 the lagenar recess and by Welman [48] as the fenestra pseudorotunda. Gower &
13
14 Weber [43] termed this structure as an “unossified gap” and homologised it with
15
16 similarly positioned unossified gaps of Sphenodon and other diapsids. Gower &
17
18
19
Weber [43] corrected Welman’s [48] interpretation of the presence of a fenestra
20
21 pseudorotunda, since this structure relates to the bony subdivision of the metotic
22
23 foramen and the formation of a true recessus scala tympani. The metotic foramen of
24
25 Euparkeria is not subdivided, and thus no fenestra pseudorotunda is present.
26
27 Although Gower & Weber [43] indicated that this unossified gap could
28
29
30 represent part of the lagenar recess, there remained some uncertainty. The specimen
31
32 UMCZ T.692 provides only a medial and a damaged lateral view of the braincase,
33
34 and Gower & Weber [43] had only a cast of SAM-PK-7696 and the work of
35
36 Cruickshank [46] at their disposal. With CT scans of SAM-PK-7696 and of SAM-PK-
37
38
39
5867 at hand, in the light of the growing literature on braincase and neuroanatomy of
40
41 fossil archosaurs [56, 60, 75] and based on comparisons to extant lepidosaurs [55],
42
43 we confirm that this space represents the ventralmost part of the lagenar recess.
44
45 We are also able to confirm that the bony bridge separating the aperture of the
46
47 gap from the margin of the fenestra ovalis is mostly formed by a thin, but marked
48
49
50 posterolateral process of the basisphenoid (Figure 3D, F). What unfortunately
51
52 remains unclear is whether there is a minor anterior contribution of the opisthotic. On
53
54 the right side of SAM-PK-7696, the cortex of the anterior surface of the distal part of
55
56 the ventral ramus of the opisthotic seems to have been worn away during preparation
57
58
59
(Figure 1F), together with the medial border of the unossified gap formed by
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 41 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 basioccipital and basisphenoid, whereas on the left side this structure is not
4
5 preserved. The left side of SAM-PK-5867 is severely damaged and on the right side
6
7 only the posterolateral process of the basisphenoid remains. If the opisthotic
8
9
10 contributed to this bridge, then it was probably just a small eminence for the
11
12 articulation with the basisphenoid.
13
14
15
16 Semilunar Depression – On the right hand side of SAM-PK-7696, immediately
17
18
19
anterior to the unossified gap there is a clear depression on the lateral surface of the
20
21 parabasisphenoid contribution to the basal tuber (Figure 1E). The posterodorsal
22
23 border of this depression is open. The anteroventral border is delimited by a crest of
24
25 bone of the parabasisphenoid on the proximal end of the basal tuber. This structure
26
27 was identified as the semilunar depression by Gower & Weber [43]. The term was
28
29
30 introduced by Evans [47] (p.186) for a similar feature in Prolacerta and Mesosuchus
31
32 and subsequently identified in other archosauriforms [51, 62, 61]. Evans [47] (fig. 7)
33
34 illustrated the abovementioned feature in SAM-PK-7696, but did not label it. We are
35
36 not able to locate this structure with certainty in SAM-PK-5867 because the basal
37
38
39
tubera of the parabasisphenoid are damaged. The form of the semilunar depression
40
41 in SAM-PK-7696 differs notably from other taxa, being much more pronounced and
42
43 more dorsally, as opposed to laterally, open than in Prolacerta (BPI 1 2675),
44
45 Proterosuchus alexanderi (NMQR 880), Osmolskina (ZPAL RV/413 and ZPAL
46
47 RV/424) and Dorosuchus (PIN 1579/62), but this may be exaggerated by loss of the
48
49
50 posteroventralmost part in this specimen.
51
52 Of the putative functions suggested for this structure, the function as an
53
54 articular facet for the ventral ramus of the opisthotic can probably be excluded as in
55
56 articulated specimens of both Euparkeria (SAM-PK-7696) and Proterosuchus goweri
57
58
59
(NMQR 880) the semilunar depression is exposed. Furthermore, in Prolacerta (BPI 1
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 42 of 103
1
2
3 2675) the ventral ramus is somewhat bent at its mid-portion, so that the distalmost
4
5 part is clearly ventrally directed and could not have articulated with the semilunar
6
7 depresion. Likewise, Evans [47] (fig. 7) illustrated the ventral ramus of Euparkeria as
8
9
10 anteroventrally directed towards the semilunar depression, but this is inaccurate. The
11
12 ventral ramus of the opisthotic is only slightly anteriorly directed and bends very
13
14 gently, extending ventrally until its distal tip (Figure 5A); no articulation with the
15
16 semilunar depression is present. The alternative functional suggestion of Evans [47]
17
18
19
for the semilunar depression is to serve as a “line of attachment for connective tissue
20
21 filling in the lower part of the overlying fenestra ovalis”. Considering this and the
22
23 definition of Gower & Weber [43] that a “lateral opening between opisthotic,
24
25 parabasisphenoid and basioccipital […] represents an unossified area […] that would
26
27 probably have been covered by cartilage in life”, then it would make the semilunar
28
29
30 depression of Evans [47] the anteroventral part of the unossified gap of Gower &
31
32 Weber [43] – or the parabasisphenoid contribution to the unossified gap. However, a
33
34 similar depression appears to be absent in crown archosaurs, non-archosauriform
35
36 archosauromorphs, and Sphenodon (ROM R9298 – Figure 20C, D), although an
37
38
39
unossified gap is often present. With the absence of a homologue in extant taxa we
40
41 cannot be certain as to the function of the semilunar depression.

45 Pneumatisation – No true pneumatic cavity was found in the sense of an
46
47 internal space within a bone connected through a foramen to other external spaces
48
49
50 such as the middle ear cavity or the pharyngeal sinus. However, CT scanning
51
52 revealed trabeculate, rather than compact, bone histology in the braincases of
53
54 Euparkeria. The pneumatic system often includes shallow recesses that do not
55
56 necessarily perforate adjacent bones (hereafter termed pneumatic sinuses), and in
57
58
59
the case of Euparkeria these may include the ventral median pharyngeal recess

3 (Figures 1D, 7B, 11A, 12F, 14B, D, mpr) and the lateral depression of the
4
5 parabasisphenoid (Figures 2E, F, 3E, 5A, B, 9A, 14E, ld). The median pharyngeal
6
7 recess (basisphenoid recess of Witmer & Ridgely [76]) is present in a number of non-
8
9
10 archosauriform reptiles such as Captorhinus laticeps [54], Youngina [65], and
11
12 Prolacerta [47], whereas the lateral depression is probably homologous with the
13
14 anterior tympanic recess of theropods and birds (see below; sensu Witmer & Ridgley
15
16 [76]), but unlike in coelurosaurs [76], it shows no pneumatisation of the surrounding
17
18
19
bones. Nesbitt [29] scored a median pharyngeal recess as absent in Euparkeria
20
21 (character 107), but his definition of this structure seems to correspond to a
22
23 pronounced depression at the anterior extreme of the ventral fossa at the midline.
24
25 Such a depression is indeed absent in Euparkeria, although appears to also be
26
27 absent in some of the taxa where this is scored as present by Nesbitt [29] (e.g.
28
29
30 Turfanosuchus dabanensis – see [77]). We would advocate using a different
31
32 nomenclature (e.g. pronounced midline fossa at anterior of median pharyngeal
33
34 recess) to describe this more pronounced recess to avoid confusion with the more
35
36 broadly applicable “median pharyngeal recess”.
37
38
39
Gower & Weber [43] described the deep lateral depression of the
40
41 parabasisphenoid as not being homologous with the anterior tympanic recess (ATR)
42
43 of birds (contra [48]), and Nesbitt [29] restricted the presence of a true anterior
44
45 tympanic recess to dinosauromorphs (character 101). However, whilst no pneumatic
46
47 sinuses leading from the lateral depression can be identified, we find that the lateral
48
49
50 depression in Euparkeria corresponds topologically to the ATR of dinosaurs and
51
52 birds. In dinosaurs and birds, the ATR arises in the region of the internal carotid
53
54 foramen, between the alaparasphenoid and the basisphenoid. The facial nerve exits
55
56 the braincase within or just posterior to the ATR and its palatine branch traverses the
57
58
59
recess [72, 76]. Similarly, the ATR of Euparkeria is located on the lateral surface of
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 44 of 103
1
2
3 the parabasisphenoid, posterodorsal to the basipterygoid process and just ventral to
4
5 the exit of the CN VII, and the palatine branch of the nerve also crosses the area. In
6
7 Euparkeria, the internal carotid artery does not enter the parabasisphenoid in the
8
9
10 ATR area, but in taxa where the internal carotid artery pierces the bone laterally
11
12 instead of ventrally it does so in this same region (e.g. [78] – see below). The ATR
13
14 identified in Silesaurus lacks pneumatic sinuses [29, 69], but is still classed as an
15
16 ATR [69] and is extremely similar both in terms of morphology and topology to the
17
18
19
lateral depression of Euparkeria. It is also located on the lateral surface of the
20
21 parabasisphenoid, posterodorsal to the basipterygoid process and ventral to the
22
23 foramen of the CN VII and on the course of its palatine branch.
24
25 We feel that the only meaningful distinction to be made between the ATR and
26
27 the lateral depression is whether pneumatic pneumatic sinuses are present leading
28
29
30 off into the braincase wall from the depression. Following this distinction, both
31
32 Silesaurus and Euparkeria would have a lateral depression whilst some dinosaurs
33
34 would show an ATR. A more straightforward way of describing this difference,
35
36 reflecting better the homology of these structures, may be an ATR lacking pneumatic
37
38
39
sinuses versus one showing pneumatic sinuses. Whilst we understand that caution is
40
41 warranted in homologizing pneumatic structures (see [72]), we do not see justification
42
43 for homologizing the recess of Silesaurus (and other taxa lacking pneumatic
44
45 pneumatic sinuses, e.g. Lewisuchus [79]) with that of dinosaurs if that of Euparkeria
46
47 is not homologized similarly. We would advocate two separate homology statements:
48
49
50 one homologizing the recess of Euparkeria, dinosaurs, and Silesaurus based on its
51
52 topological correspondence, and a second homologizing the presence of pneumatic
53
54 pneumatic sinuses (i.e. the condition seen in theropods). We also note that a very
55
56 similar structure, which we would homologize with the lateral depression of
57
58
59
Euparkeria, is present in some non-crocodylomorph pseudosuchians (e.g.

4
5 inexpectatus [81], Lehane [82]; Postosuchus [83]), and thus presence of a lateral
6
7 depression (=anterior tympanic recess) does not necessarily support
8
9
10 avemetatarsalian affinities for Euparkeria.
11
12
13
14 Laterosphenoid – The presence or absence of an ossified element forming the
15
16 anterior braincase wall of stem archosauriforms was a topic of some uncertainty until
17
18
19
the presence of such ossifications was demonstrated in Euparkeria and
20
21 Proterosuchus alexanderi by Clark et al. [63]. However, at the time of that publication,
22
23 further preparation to reveal the laterosphenoids of the holotype of Euparkeria was
24
25 not complete, and an apparent disarticulated laterosphenoid in SAM-PK-7696 was
26
27 relied upon to describe the element. On inspection of SAM-PK-7696 we find it difficult
28
29
30 both to confirm the identification of the element as a laterosphenoid and to identify
31
32 morphological features thereof with certainty. Examination of the laterosphenoids of
33
34 SAM-PK-5867 and UMZC T.692 provides confirmation of the morphology of this
35
36 element in specimens where there is no doubt regarding the identification as a
37
38
39
laterosphenoid.
40
41 The first usage of the term “laterosphenoid” was to refer to the anteriormost
42
43 ossification of the braincase of crocodilians [63], but subsequent usage of the term
44
45 included a non-homologous ossification in snakes, a partially homologous ossification
46
47 in non-ophidian lepidosaurs, and a probably homologous structure in birds. In fact,
48
49
50 the developmental definition of a laterosphenoid was based on the embryology of
51
52 non-ophidian lepidosaurs, a group in which this element seldomly ossifies [84].
53
54 According to this, the laterosphenoid represents the ossification of part of the
55
56 embryonic pila antotica (Figure 18), a cartilaginous structure located between the
57
58
59
exits of CN III and CN IV anteriorly and of the CN V posteriorly [85, 84, 86]. In
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 46 of 103
1
2
3 addition to the laterosphenoid, another element may ossify (or just calcify) in the
4
5 anterior braincase wall of non-ophidian lepidosaurs: the orbitosphenoid. The
6
7 orbitosphenoid is formed by the ossification of the pila metoptica (which forms the
8
9
10 anteriormost part of the embryonic braincase, between CN II anteriorly and CN III
11
12 and IV posteriorly) with some contribution from the taenia medialis – which connects
13
14 the pila metoptica to the structure supporting the olfactory bulb, the planum
15
16 supraseptale [84] (Figure 18). In contrast, the laterosphenoid of crocodilians does not
17
18
19
quite conform to this definition. It is composed of the pila antotica, the pila metoptica,
20
21 and part of the taenia medialis [84, 87]. If preference is given to the first usage, the
22
23 laterosphenoid and orbitosphenoid of non-ophidian squamates can thus be looked
24
25 upon as ossifications of subsets of the “true” laterosphenoid.
26
27 The ossifications of Euparkeria and Proterosuchus alexanderi appear to
28
29
30 fundamentally conform to the crocodilian condition, and thus presumably to include
31
32 all three embryonic elements. However, the laterosphenoids of Euparkeria and
33
34 Proterosuchus differ from those of crocodilians in that a slender process is present,
35
36 markedly separating the foramen of CN III and CN IV from that of CN II (Figure 15,
37
38
39
sp). By contrast, in crocodilians, the separation of these nerves by the laterosphenoid
40
41 is made by a very modest process, the ventral portion of which is completed by a
42
43 dorsal extension of the cultriform process of the parabasisphenoid (Figure 21A, B, C).
44
45 These differences can be interpreted as indicating a greater degree of ossification of
46
47 the pila metoptica in Euparkeria and Proterosuchus than in crocodilians.
48
49
50 Furthermore, the foramina for the olfactory and optic nerves are only separated by a
51
52 brief contact of the right and left laterosphenoids in crocodilians (Figure 21D).
53
54 In contrast, in Euparkeria, and yet further so in Proterosuchus, the contact is
55
56 more extensive and the laterosphenoids of the fossil taxa extend further anteriorly
57
58
59
between the orbits than the ossification in crocodilians, reaching as far as the anterior
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 47 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 third of the orbit (in crocodilians the laterosphenoid does not reach the middle of the
4
5 orbit – e.g. Alligator sp. specimen 238 of the Biological Sciences Collection of the
6
7 University of Birmingham, UK). Such an anterior extension suggests a greater degree
8
9
10 of ossification of the taenia medialis than in crocodilians, and also potentially that
11
12 another embryonic element may, at least in part, be involved in the formation of the
13
14 laterosphenoid of Euparkeria and Proterosuchus, namely the planum supraseptale
15
16 (Figure 18). The planum supraseptale results from the fusion of the embryonic orbital
17
18
19
cartilages and, as mentioned above, supports the forebrain. The planum
20
21 supraseptale may form a ventral keel, the interorbital septum, to connect to the basal
22
23 plate and together interorbital septum and planum supraseptale are considered to
24
25 ossify as a third element, the sphenethmoid [84, 86].
26
27 Sphenethmoids are common ossifications identified in reptiliomorphs close to
28
29
30 amniotes such as diadectomorphs [88, 89], and also in basal reptilians such as
31
32 captorhinids and parareptiles [54, 90, 91] that are thought to be subsequently lost in
33
34 saurians [92]. Although, in many instances the sphenoid ossification does not ossify
35
36 farther posteriorly at the anterior region of the braincase (e.g. [93]), the term
37
38
39
“sphenethmoid” does include ossifications that would in theory comprise parts of the
40
41 laterosphenoid – the pila antotica, the pila metoptica and the taenia medialis [92, 94].
42
43 Thus, the sphenethmoid would be homologous to the laterosphenoid of stem
44
45 archosaurs and crocodilians. As revealed by the CT scans of SAM-PK-5867 and
46
47 UMCZ T.692, ossifications of the anterior braincase wall are very thin and delicate
48
49
50 structures that can be easily prepared away and it may well be that such structures
51
52 are indeed present in other basal diapsids. In fact, a sphenethmoid has been
53
54 identified in the diapsid of uncertain affinities Elachistosuchus huenei [95] and also
55
56 tentatively in Youngina ([96]; although it was not mentioned by Gardner et al. [65]).

3 The anterior braincase wall ossification of some basal pseudosuchians (e.g.
4
5 Stagonolepis olenkae [78]; Shuvosaurus [81]; Lehane [82]) appears to have been
6
7 more similar to that of Euparkeria and Proterosuchus alexanderi than to that of
8
9
10 modern crocodilians, in lacking a contact between the cultriform process and the
11
12 slender process. However, other basal pseudosuchians do show such a contact
13
14 (Stagonolepis robertsoni [72]; Desmatosuchus spurensis [97]), though whether the
15
16 parabasisphenoid formed part of the margin of the CN II foramen is not clear. The
17
18
19
anterior braincase wall of other fossil taxa closer to (e.g. Prestosuchus [80]) or within
20
21 (e.g. Sphenosuchus [68]) Crocodylomorpha are more similar to that of crocodilians in
22
23 that the ventral border of the foramen of CN II is formed by the basisphenoid.
24
25 The condition in extant birds is more similar to the one found in Euparkeria
26
27 and Proterosuchus alexanderi than to that in crocodilians, in that all the embryonic
28
29
30 structures (namely the pila antotica, pila metoptica, taenia medialis, planum
31
32 supraseptale and interorbital septum) ossify [84, 86] (Figures 19, 22). However, in
33
34 avian terminology, instead of sphenethmoid it is more common to find the terms
35
36 “interorbital septum” and/or “mesethmoid” for the ossifications anterior to the foramen
37
38
39
of CN II [98, 99]. The presence of these ossifications in dinosaurs is well documented
40
41 in derived ornithischians [66], sauropods [100–102], and theropods [60]. An
42
43 orbitosphenoid distinguished from the laterosphenoid is often described, although in
44
45 most cases sutures are difficult to identify.
46
47 A laterosphenoid is documented for a number of less derived crown taxa [29],
48
49
50 but well-preserved and complete elements suitable for a more detailed analysis are
51
52 still somewhat rare. The laterosphenoid of Heterodontosaurus tucki appears similar
53
54 to that of some pseudosuchians [103], in that a short spur makes the contact with the
55
56 basisphenoid. However, the contribution of the basisphenoid to the foramen of CN II
57
58
59
is unclear. The degree of ossification, as well as the anterior extension of this
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 49 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 structure, seems to include not only the pila antotica, but also the pila metoptica and
4
5 taenia medialis – but not the planum supraseptale. A distinction is made between
6
7 laterosphenoid and orbitosphenoid in figs. 2B and 15B of Norman et al. [103], but no
8
9
10 description is provided.
11
12 On the other hand, the laterosphenoids of Coelophysis bauri [29],
13
14 Lesothosaurus diagnosticus [21], Tawa hallae [27], as well as that of basal
15
16 ornithopods Dysalotosaurus [56], Thescelosaurus neglectus [104], and
17
18
19
Hypsilophodon foxii [105] are strikingly different. In these taxa, the ossification seems
20
21 to be restricted to the posterior part of the pila antotica only. As a consequence, the
22
23 exits of the cranial nerves I–IV are not represented by foramina and there is also no
24
25 contact to the cultriform process of the parabasisphenoid. A foramen for CN III is
26
27 identified for Lesothosaurus [21] but we regard that as unlikely due to its posterior
28
29
30 position. In these taxa, the laterosphenoid seems to correspond to the ossification of
31
32 the pila antotica only, resembling the laterosphenoid sensu Bellairs & Kamal [84].
33
34 Whether the anterior part of the ossification was not present or has been prepared
35
36 away, (or if these represent juvenile individuals) is unknown, but it is likely that a
37
38
39
reduction in the degree of ossification of the anterior braincase wall occurred in some
40
41 taxa. Laterosphenoids of more derived theropods such as Alioramus altai [106] or
42
43 Troodon formosus [107] are again represented by complex and extensive structures,
44
45 likely encompassing multiple embryonic elements.
46
47 Irrespective of the terminology employed, our main intention here is to
48
49
50 demonstrate that the laterosphenoids of Euparkeria, Proterosuchus alexanderi, and
51
52 other basal archosaurs do not appear to be exactly the same structure as the
53
54 laterosphenoid of extant crocodilians and may be more similar to that of extant birds
55
56 than previously acknowledged. Also, given the delicate nature of the ossifications of
57
58
59
the anterior braincase wall and the presence of such structures in a diapsid incertae
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 50 of 103
1
2
3 sedis (Elachistosuchus huenei [95]), it may be that these elements were not lost in
4
5 the evolutionary history of reptilians and subsequently reappeared in
6
7 archosauriforms, but that it has been present throughout Diapsida, being lost only at
8
9
10 a certain stage within Lepidosauromorpha.
11
12
13
14 Euparkeria in the context of wider diapsid braincase evolution
15
16 Since the seminal work of Gower & Weber [43], our knowledge of fossil
17
18
19
archosauromorph braincases has increased substantially thanks to a large number of
20
21 new descriptions [56, 57, 65, 69, 70, 78, 100, 108–111], as has our understanding of
22
23 the phylogenetic relationships of early and stem archosaurs [3, 29, 112–114]. It is
24
25 thus appropriate to attempt to place the braincase of Euparkeria capensis in the
26
27 context of the wider archosauromorph and eureptilian radiation, and in the
28
29
30 morphological trends seen both stemward and crownward of the taxon.
31
32 Increasing braincase height relative to anteroposterior length is identifiable as
33
34 a trend in archosauromorph and diapsid braincase evolution, with Gower & Sennikov
35
36 [51] first attempting to capture this change via the character of a verticalized
37
38
39
parabasisphenoid, with the basal tubera dorsal to the basipterygoid processes.
40
41 However, another degree of verticalization is found in non-archosauromorph diapsids
42
43 in the contact between basioccipital and parabasisphenoid, so that the occipital
44
45 condyle lies dorsal to the basal tubera. The braincase of basal eureptilians is
46
47 anteroposteriorly flat in spite of a very subtle angle formed by the contact between
48
49
50 parasphenoid and basioccipital (e.g. Captorhinus [54]), and the dorsoventral distance
51
52 between occipital condyle and the basal tubera increases in basal diapsids (e.g.
53
54 Youngina [65, 87]). The angulation of the parabasisphenoid first appears in
55
56 archosauromorphs.

2
3 In Euparkeria, the basal tubera are placed noticeably dorsal to the
4
5 basipterygoid processes in lateral view, and the occipital condyle is in turn dorsal to
6
7 the basal tubera (Figures 9C, 10B, 14E). This contrasts with the state in the
8
9
10 archosauromorph Prolacerta (Evans 1986; Gower & Sennikov 1996) [47, 51], and the
11
12 archosauriforms Proterosuchus fergusi [51], and Fugusuchus [51], which show much
13
14 more horizontal braincases. A relatively tall, verticalized parabasisphenoid is typical
15
16 of crown archosaurs (e.g. Coelophysis rhodesiensis [116]; Stagonolepis robertsoni
17
18
19
[68]), but it is also found in many archosauriforms (e.g. Erythrosuchus [62];
20
21 Sarmatosuchus otschevi [51]) and some archosauromorphs (Trilophosaurus – UCMP
22
23 V6374; Mesosuchus – SAM-PK-6536). Some archosaurs, however, do show a lesser
24
25 degree of angulation between basioccipital and parabasisphenoid (e.g.
26
27 Desmatosuchus spurensis [97]; Lewisuchus admixtus [79]; Silesaurus [69]; and
28
29
30 Stagonolepis olenkae [78]).
31
32 Another trend in diapsid and archosauromorph evolution is the increase in the
33
34 participation of the basioccipital in the braincase floor. As the myelencephalon
35
36 appears to correlate with the basioccipital and the parabasisphenoid with the
37
38
39
metencephalon, this may reflect an increase in the posterior part of the hindbrain
40
41 relative to the anterior part. Basal eureptilians have a parasphenoid as long as two
42
43 thirds of the anteroposterior length of the braincase (e.g. Captorhinus [54]). The
44
45 contribution of both elements is more equal in basal diapsids (e.g. Araeoscelis
46
47 gracilis [117]; Youngina [65, 115]). The situation is similar in the archosauromorph
48
49
50 Prolacerta [47], but the basioccipital contribution is somewhat greater in the
51
52 archosauromorphs Trilophosaurus [71] and Mesosuchus (SAM-PK-6536),
53
54 demonstrating that this “trend” is not uniform, given that these taxa are generally
55
56 placed lower on the stem than Prolacerta (e.g. [118]). In Euparkeria capensis, and
57
58
59
many crown taxa (e.g. Silesaurus [69]; Stagonolepis robertsoni [119]) the contribution
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 52 of 103
1
2
3 of the parabasisphenoid to the braincase floor is limited to at most the anterior third
4
5 (Figure 6C).
6
7 The contribution of the parabasisphenoid to the lateral braincase wall also
8
9
10 tends to decrease towards the archosaur crown, as it is replaced by the anterior
11
12 inferior process of the prootic. This development reflects assimilation of the
13
14 embryonic pila antotica by the bone (see below). The parabasisphenoid forms the
15
16 anteroventral border of the trigeminal notch in basal eureptilians (e.g. Captorhinus
17
18
19
[54]), but in diapsids its contribution decreases due to the development of a small
20
21 anterior inferior process (e.g. Youngina [65, 115]). Participation of the
22
23 parabasisphenoid disappears completely in archosauromorphs (e.g. Trilophosaurus
24
25 [71]; Mesosuchus – SAM-PK-6536; Prolacerta [47]), including Euparkeria.
26
27 Further development of the prootic is exemplified by increased ossification
28
29
30 dorsal to the foramen for CN V, by the relative positions of the trigeminal foramen and
31
32 that for CN VII, and by the prootic contribution to the dorsum sellae. These are all
33
34 connected to assimilations of further embryonic structures by the prootic. The region
35
36 of the prootic dorsal to the trigeminal notch and anterior to the otic capsule is the alar
37
38
39
process [86], and appears to be absent, or very weakly developed, in early
40
41 eureptilians (e.g. Captorhinus [54]). The process becomes more ossified towards the
42
43 crown and in Euparkeria, Fugusuchus and Xilousuchus [51], and Erythrosuchus [62]
44
45 (BPI 3893) it shows an extensive degree of ossification. The prootic may continue to
46
47 expand anterodorsally in crown archosaurs, and eventually enclose the foramen of
48
49
50 CN V entirely (e.g. Dysalotosaurus [56]).
51
52 The ossification of the body of the prootic is related to the otic capsule and to
53
54 the prefacial and basicapsular commissures – connections of cartilage formed
55
56 between the otic capsule and the basal plate [86]. Its lateral wall is characterized by
57
58
59
the presence of the crista prootica, ventral to which the trigeminal and facial nerves
60

Page 53 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 exit the braincase. In basal eureptilians, the foramina for the nerves lie in the same
4
5 horizontal plane, also indicated by a horizontal crest (e.g. Captorhinus [54]). In
6
7 diapsids (e.g. Youngina [115]), a shift occurs in the relative positions of these
8
9
10 foramina, with the facial foramen lying a short distance ventral to the trigeminal
11
12 foramen. The crest thus curves gently in an anteroventral direction. In
13
14 archosauromorphs the morphology is more varied, and some taxa show a roughly
15
16 horizontal crest (e.g. Prolacerta [47]), while the crest of others is strongly inclined
17
18
19
(e.g. Mesosuchus – SAM-PK-6536). The foramina in archosauriforms, including
20
21 Euparkeria, are also asymmetrically positioned, albeit not to the same degree as in
22
23 Mesosuchus (e.g. Fugusuchus, Garjania, Xilousuchus [51]; Erythrosuchus [62]). A
24
25 stronger anteroventral inclination of the crista is also found also in crown archosaurs
26
27 (e.g. Silesaurus [69]; Stagonolepis olenkae [78]).
28
29
30 The exact extent of the contribution of the prootic and parabasisphenoid to the
31
32 dorsum sellae is difficult to confirm in some taxa. It is formed by the basisphenoid
33
34 only in basal eureptilians (e.g. Captorhinus [54]), in basal diapsids (e.g. Youngina
35
36 [65]), and at least in some archosauromorphs (e.g. Prolacerta [47]). The participation
37
38
39
of the prootic in Euparkeria indicates assimilation of the embryonic basal plate by the
40
41 prootic [86].
42
43 The hearing system also shows considerable changes along the diapsid and
44
45 archosauromorph lineages. A pattern that has been extensively discussed in the
46
47 evolution of the hearing system is the identification of the elements forming the
48
49
50 border of the fenestra ovalis. The relative contributions of these bones are of
51
52 particular interest in the construction of homology statements [120]. In basal
53
54 eureptilians [54] and the basal diapsid Araeoscelis gracilis [117], the parasphenoid,
55
56 basisphenoid and basioccipital contribute significantly to the ventral, anterior and
57
58
59
posterior rims of the fenestra ovalis respectively, with limited contribution by the
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 54 of 103
1
2
3 prootic anterodorsally. In Euparkeria capensis, the prootic and opisthotic form most of
4
5 the anterior and posterior borders of the fenestra ovalis respectively, with a small
6
7 posteroventral contribution by the basioccipital on the medial side of the fenestra,
8
9
10 and a contribution to the anterior rim by the posterodorsal process of the
11
12 parabasisphenoid (Figure 6C). In extant archosaurs the prootic and opisthotic alone
13
14 form the border of the fenestra ovalis [43], but in several extinct crown archosaurs
15
16 (e.g. [56, 69]) the basioccipital and parabasisphenoid are not completely excluded
17
18
19
from the fenestra ovalis, with very restricted contributions at its ventralmost extent,
20
21 whilst in other extinct crown taxa [97] and in erythrosuchids [62] a small basioccipital
22
23 contribution at least is reported. However, this trend is not clear cut, as in the basal
24
25 diapsid Youngina, and the archosauromorphs Prolacerta and Trilophosaurus the
26
27 basioccipital appears to have been totally excluded from the fenestra ovalis by the
28
29
30 opisthotic [47, 65, 71, 115].
31
32 Elongation of the semicircular canals is seen in crown archosaurs in
33
34 comparison to the only fossil basal diapsid for which the structure of the semicircular
35
36 canals is well known – Youngina [65]. Strongly elongated semicircular canals are
37
38
39
seen in flying and gliding taxa [121]. It indicates that elongation facilitates improved
40
41 locomotor agility, with elongation of a particular semicircular canal corresponding to
42
43 increased sensitivity in its plane of action [60, 75]. The inner ear of Euparkeria shows
44
45 relatively elongated semicircular canals with larger radii of curvature when compared
46
47 to Youngina, especially the posterior semicircular canal. They are, however, not as
48
49
50 strongly elongated as those of coelurosaurian theropods (especially birds; [75, 121,
51
52 122]) and pterosaurs [121], where the anterior semicircular canal is particularly
53
54 elongated. Similarly, the size of the floccular lobe, and thus the floccular fossa in
55
56 which it sits, has been hypothesized to facilitate agility [123], as it emits coordination-
57
58
59
related responses important in movements of the head and eyes [124]. In Euparkeria,
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 55 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 the floccular fossa is larger than in Youngina, but much smaller than in modern birds
4
5 [122]. Taken together, the form of the semicircular canals and floccular lobe may be
6
7 indicative of the more upright, agile locomotory pattern seen in Euparkeria than in
8
9
10 “sprawling” diapsids such as Youngina.
11
12 An increase in cochlear length is also evident when the cochlea of Euparkeria
13
14 and other basal taxa such as Youngina and Captorhinus are compared, indicating
15
16 improved hearing ability. Different groups of hair cells have stereocilia with varying
17
18
19
degrees of length and stiffness, and the mass of the basilar membrane itself changes
20
21 topologically. Thus, different parts of the cochlea resonate differently to the same
22
23 sound frequency and the auditory epithelium is said to be tonotopically arranged
24
25 along its axis [125, 126]. In order to expand the hearing range, an increased number
26
27 of cells are necessary, resulting in a longer cochlea. This is called mechanical tuning,
28
29
30 and is assumed to correspond to the plesiomorphic type of tonotopic discrimination in
31
32 amniotes [127, 128]. However, physiological tuning mechanisms such as electrical
33
34 resonance became predominant during the evolutionary history of birds and turtles.
35
36 In these, hair cells set up a voltage gradient via active K+/Ca2+ channels, oscillating in
37
38
39
response to a depolarizing stimulus [128]. Although the elongation of the cochlea is
40
41 also present in birds, and to a lesser extent also in crocodylians, it seems to be less
42
43 important for sound discrimination than the physiological properties of the inner ear.
44
45 Because mechanical tuning is an important property of the ear of extant
46
47 mammals and squamates [125, 127], but not so much for birds and turtles [128], it is
48
49
50 likely that basal archosauromorphs also relied on such mechanisms. A further,
51
52 indirect indication of the importance of mechanical tuning in hearing is extensive
53
54 ossification of the otic capsule. Increased ossification raises the stiffness of the
55
56 system and influences frequency response by reducing energy loss due to flexion
57
58
59
[129]. Increased ossification also promotes acoustic isolation, hindering sound
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 56 of 103
1
2
3 conduction along routes other than those where sound detecting tissues are located.
4
5 However, acoustic isolation without a compensatory mechanism for pressure-relief
6
7 can limit hearing capacity [74, 130]. Crown group archosaurs developed a
8
9
10 specialized pressure-relief window, a fenestra pseudorotunda, in which the metotic
11
12 foramen becomes subdivided into anterior and posterior regions [43]. The
13
14 compensatory mechanism of the fenestra pseudorotunda can, to a lesser extent, be
15
16 carried out by the undivided metotic foramen [86]. The medial wall of the otic capsule
17
18
19
of most eureptilians is extensively unossified, but the metotic foramen becomes
20
21 increasingly enlarged. The metotic foramen of Euparkeria is even more enlarged than
22
23 that of Captorhinus [54], Youngina [115] or Prolacerta [47], and there is further
24
25 differentiation of a pressure-relief region ventrally.
26
27 Some of the changes seen in the lineage leading to Euparkeria, and
28
29
30 subsequently within the archosaur crown, relate to the changing ecomorphology of
31
32 the taxa. A general increase in ossification of the braincase may be indicative of
33
34 development of the forebrain and improvement of terrestrial hearing. Furthermore,
35
36 increased length of the semicircular canals and increased size of the floccular lobe
37
38
39
are probably indicative of the change from a sprawling to upright gait. The changes
40
41 witnessed along the lineage leading to Euparkeria and beyond can thus be framed as
42
43 part of the broader terrestrial amniote pattern of increasing adaptation to terrestriality,
44
45 including locomotion and hearing, and of development of increased cognitive
46
47 abilities.

52 CONCLUSIONS
53
54 For the first time, a complete description of the braincase of Euparkeria capensis is
55
56 undertaken based on all available material. We were able confirm and correct several
57
58
59
details of descriptions published previously. For instance, we confirm the presence of
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 57 of 103 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 a laterosphenoid in the anterior braincase region of Euparkeria, and find that the
4
5 element may not be fully homologous with that present in extant crocodylians, with
6
7 the crocodilian condition being less ossified. We also homologise the anterior
8
9
10 tympanic recess of Eupakeria with that of other basal archosaurs. The elongation of
11
12 the semicircular canals (the anterior in particular) and the enlargement of the
13
14 floccular fossa may correspond to development of a more upright posture and a more
15
16 active lifestyle in Euparkeria than in basal diapsids and taxa further down the
17
18
19
archosaur stem. The enlargement of the fenestra ovalis and of the metotic foramen,
20
21 together with the regionalisation of the latter and the elongation of the cochlea, are
22
23 considered to be related to extension of the hearing range and improvements in the
24
25 impedance matching functions of the inner ear, pointing to further development of a
26
27 sense of hearing more adapted to terrestrial environments.

Reviewer: 1
The few remark I have are all labelled in the PDF.
These are answered individually below.
Some of the images are really too dark but this might be due the files accessible to me. If not,
hey should be improved by either selectin a light gray background or lighter photos.
Redone.
Some of the photos would be easier to read with the help of line drawings. The work is worth
t.
We agree that making line drawings out of the figures is the best way to present the reader with
he information available: the material as it stands, and our interpretations. However, given the
amount of materials, and figures, in this manuscript, this would make the final paper much
engthier than it already is. We have, therefore, selected the most informative ones or the most
difficult to understand ones to make line drawings out of them. We also chose to repeat some
igures to show different structures and avoid over-labelling. We believe this is the best way to
balance our manuscript.

unclear, what you exactly mean here
n some taxa, the parabsisphenoid extends far posteriorly as to reach, and contribute to, the
posterior border of the fenstra ovalis in lateral view. The same was assumed for Euparkeria in
previous works, but our evaluation of all specimens showed us this is not the case. However,
he bone still participates in the formation of the anteroventeal border of the fenestra by means
of a dorsal projection. The sentence was slightly modified.
which one?
The lateral depression. Sentence modified.
either it does or it doesn´t
The laterosphenoid of Eupakeria does not have the exact same anatomy of either birds or
crocodiles. However, as we argue later in the MS, it is more similar to the avian bone. We cut
he word “relatively” to avoid confusion.
what do you mean with this? Like a lagena or an extended cochlea?
The cochlear duct of diapsids has two different parts, the auditory papilla and the lagena macula
Wever 1978). Usually, “cochlea” is used to refer to both the cochlear duct as a whole, and to
he auditory papilla part of the duct only (as opposed to lagena). Since it not possible to
discriminate these two parts in fossil archosauromorphs, we used the term “cochlea” for the
“elongate”, i.e. forming a deep cochlear recess.
what is "much"?
n comparison to the ration metotic foramen/fenestra ovalis of other basal archosauromorphs
such as Prolacerta. Sentence slightly modified.
what do you mean?
By “regionalized” we meant that the vagus and recessus scalae tympani areas are well marked
and distinct from one another. We slightly modified the sentence, but the full explanation to
his is found later in the discussion.
Well, they shure were terrestrial. Do yo mean an enhanced terrestrial locomotion mode?
Also. There are two points in this sentence: locomotion and hearing, both of which are related
o anatomy of the braincase and inner ear of Euparkeria. The term “terrestriality” was used to
efer to the hearing sense. Hearing in a terrestrial environment is more complicated than in an
aquatic environment due to the strikingly different impedances of the aerial medium of the
environment and the aqueous medium of the vertebrate body. This difference accounts for much
of the energy loss when sound waves cross them both, making air-borne sounds much more
difficult to detect than aquatic ones. Terrestrial vertebrates have developed different, and often
convergent, ways to deal with this problem. The highlighted braincase anatomy aspects thus
make the hearing system of Euparkeria much more suited for terrestrial habitats than those of
axa without them. The sentence has been divided into two to make it clearer.
There are more than 10000 extant avian taxa alone, not to speak of the extinct ones!; modern;
To what does this refer to?
Rephrased. Archosaurs have taxonomically dominated terrestrial ecosystems since their origin.
eco niches cannot be large-bodied
Rephrased to “Archosaurs filled most terrestrial ecological niches for large-bodied vertebrates”.
They still exist.
But they have not filled the niches for large bodies organisms after that.
with respect to what? Size? Diversity?
This refers to the fact that archosaurs filled most macroscale terrestrial niches – we think this is
elatively clear from the text in fact; the concept of ecological dominance is of course at best
nebulous.
iterature
We don not think this needs literature – this sentence is elaborated on subsequently. It leads in
o sentences where literature is cited.
For the reason of being very closely related to archosaurs, irrespective of whether it is the
mmediate sister group or not. We think this is clear from the text.
What is the difference?
A phylogenetic analysis is an evolutionary analysis but not every evolutionary analysis is
phylogenetic.
are there un-striking ones?
Changed to “unique”. There are locally optimizing autapomorphies, but not anything not seen
anywhere else.

Broader than the crown radiation. Rephrased.

To other archosauromorphs. Rephrased.

We prefer elongate.

The sentence is complete as it stands.
why in quotes?
Because it refers to an expression coined by Gower & Weber (1998) to refer to a structure
whose function has not yet been made clear, and to which no formal name has been given. We
have now made this clearer by explicitly referring to the paper where the term was coined.
with respect to what?
With respect to the anterior two-thirds of the braincase. We rephrased to “sub-horizontal”.

he shadows appear a little dark. I also would do all labeling on the interpretive drawings in
order not to disturb the photos. Most of the labels are redundant anyway.
The brightness of the figures pointed out by the reviewer were corrected. Please check the newly
uploaded figures. As for the line drawings: whilst we understand, and agree with, the reviewer’s
points, we think providing a line drawing for each figure would make the MS much lengthier
han it already is. We have carefully thought about this before, and thus chosen to provide line
drawings for some figures only. We also consider that placing the labels only on the line

hese two are very clumsy for a schematic drawing. Please improve.
These drawings are not ours, we just modified them from the mentioned source. We however,
disagree with the reviewer, and think these are perfectly fine for their purpose.
1) The descriptions are detailed and well considered, and represent solid anatomical work. The
use of µCT to see this anatomy more clearly is well justified, but the description and supporting
igures essentially follow traditional lines. This is no bad thing, but since the late 1990s it has
become normal to provide the reader with images of virtual casts of endocranial surfaces, which
are often easier to interpret on paper.
The cranial endocast is something we intentionally left out, because it is going to be used in a
subsequent work from the authors. We thus focused on the anatomy of the braincase and the
nner ear.
These need not be complete. This has been done to an extent in Figure 16, although I would
ike to see the cochlear duct as part of the labyrinth to get some kind of idea of *how* elongate
t really is.
As stated in page 39 (discussion on the inner ear of Euparkeria), we agree with Gower & Weber
hat shaping the tip of the cochlea is impossible for Euparkeria with the evidence we have now.
We interpret it as passing ventrally on the lateral side of the parabasisphenoid and basioccipital,
but it is not possible to know where it should end. Therefore we have chosen not to reconstruct
t. However, considering that the cochlea of Youngina does not extend as much ventrally as that
of Euparkeria (i.e. does not extend ventrally lateral to the braincase floor), we consider it longer
han in the latter than in the former. The situation is unfortunately currently unknown in other
archosauriforms.
To clarify this issue, we modified the beginning of the corresponding paragraph in the
discussion section (page 56). It now reads: “In non-saurian diapsid taxa such as Captorhinus
and Youngina, there is no recess on the dorsal surface of the basioccipita/parabasisphenoid
ndicating that the cochlea would extend further ventrally than the limit of the braincase floor.
As we interpret the distal tip of the cochlea of Euparkeria passing lateral do the braincase floor
and medial to the bony bar connecting the ventral ramus of the opisthotic and the posterodorsal
egion of the parabasisphenoid, an increase in cochlear length is also evident in Euparkeria,
ndicating an improved hearing ability.”
f this can only be conveyed to the reader by providing a line drawing reconstruction, this would
be VERY useful. Why do the supplementary data include no mesh model files 3D PDFs so that
he reader can investigate the specimens using one of the many free viewers? Stereopairs are
useful if only a hard copy is available, but given the reader already has to be online to download
hem, there is also no reason the full 3D morphology should not also be available to investigate.
We think this is a great idea, but not sure RSOS supports it.
2) Related to 1), measurements are needed. Linear measurements, angles, volumes etc. are
valuable raw data and incredibly useful for future comparison – please at least add a table
containing them. Of course, if accurate 3D models are included, the reader can take their own
measurements.
A table with measurements was added at the end of the MS.
3) Without wishing to push my own work, I’m surprised the authors discuss cochlear duct
ength in relation to what it can tell about hearing in extinct animals, and the floccular fossa in
deal with this (see below). In particular, the reason for why the flocculus might have been
expressed through the rostral SSC in archosaurs is discussed in Walsh et al. (2013).
Walsh, S. A., Barrett, P. M., Milner, A. C., Manley, G., and Witmer, L. M. 2009. Inner
ear anatomy is a proxy for deducing auditory capability and behaviour in reptiles and birds.
Proceedings of the Royal Society B 276, 1355–1360.
Walsh, S. A., Iwaniuk, A. N., Knoll M. A., Bourdon, E., Barrett, P. M., Milner, A. C.,
Nudds, R., Abel, R. L. and Dello Sterpaio, P. 2013. Avian cerebellar floccular fossa size is not
a proxy for flying ability in birds. PLoS ONE, 8(6), e67176.
While it was not our intention to go much into details of the hearing capabilities or behavior of
Euparkeria in this manuscript, we understand the importance of pointing out these works for
he readers. In fact, one of us (GS) had already used Walsh et al. (2009) in earlier studies (Sobral
et al., 2012).
For the cochlear length discussion, we added the following sentence: “In fact, it has
been shown that cochlear length is predictive of both auditory capabilities and behaviour in
extant archosaurs [Walsh et al., 2009].”
For the floccular size, the corresponding part of the paragraph now reads: “Similarly,
he size of the floccular lobe, and thus the floccular fossa in which it sits, has been hypothesized
o facilitate agility [123], as it emits coordination-related responses important in movements of
he head and eyes [124] – although the floccular size alone may not be a good proxy for
predicting flying ability in birds [Walsh et al. 2013]. An enlarged foccular lobe may be a result
not only of the increase amount of floccular tissure itself, but also of other parts of the
vestibulocerebellum involved in postural and locomotor reflexes [Walsh et al. 2013]. Expansion
of these parts may be responsible for the expression of the floccular lobe through the anterior
semicircular canal, and its secondary enlargement. However, it may be difficult to discriminate
cause from consequence in these cases. In Euparkeria, the floccular fossa is much smaller than
n modern birds [122], but larger than in Youngina, as shown not only by the increased radius
of curvature of the anterior semicircular canal, but also by the depth of the fossa on the medial
side of the prootic. Taken together, both the form of the semicircular canals and the size of the
loccular lobe may be indicative of navigation in more complex, three-dimensional
environments, thus supporting a more upright, agile locomotory pattern seen in Euparkeria [18]
han in “sprawling” diapsids such as Youngina.”
The MS is well written, but there are some minor points:
General: be careful when using verbs in the active voice for anatomical description (e.g., the
dorsal margin of the cultriform process “moves” dorsally (P12, ln. 8) – it doesn’t move.
Changed to “rises”. We attempted to avoid these terms.
P2, ln. 59: “crocodilian” should be plural.
Corrected.
P4, ln. 3: Is there a word missing after “bipedal”?
Corrected. Sentence now reads “bipedal ones”.
Yes, corrected.
P30, ln. 14: Should “that” be ‘those’?
Yes, corrected.
P44, ln. 27: Do you really mean “pneumatic pneumatic”?
No. Corrected.
P56, lns 45-7: You suggest the changes leading to _Euparkeria_ led to development of increased
cognitive abilities, but this comment comes somewhat out of the blue. I would recommend
expanding on why you suggest this, or delete that part of the sentence. There are theoretical
easons why increased sensory and locomotory ability may be accompanied by increases in
cognitive ability, but these would need unpacking from the statement as it stands.
See above.
P74, caption for Figure 1: what is the red squiggle in part B?
The red line indicates the suture line between exoccipital and opisthotic/supraoccipital based
on CT scans. Added to caption. Identification of coloured lines also added to caption of figure
11.
Caption for Figure 6: it would be worth stating that the bone has been rendered transparent,
hough this really should be obvious to the reader.
Added. Also for the caption of figure 16.
The text is well written and the figures are very informative, but the drawings are very flat and
t is difficult to distinguish the overall morphology of the structures and several anatomical
eatures. I strongly recommend the reviewers to re-draw the interpretative drawings of the
braincase (e.g. figures 4, 8, 10) using different line thicknesses – thicker lines for borders closer
o the eye and thinner lines for more distant margins. In addition, I suggest not making
continuous margins that extend behind others because in this way the eye will notice that one
ine is behind the other. If the drawings are redone following these suggestions they will have
a “more 3D appearance” than in their current form and the figure quality of the manuscript will
be considerably improved.
Line drawing were re-done.
The authors consider that Euparkeria possesses an anterior tympanic recess, contrasting with
he interpretation of several recent authors. I agree with the presence of a depression in this
egion of the parabasisphenoid, but I am sceptical that they represent the same condition. The
anterior tympanic recess is relatively deep and occupies most of the lateral surface of the
parabaisphenoid anteriorly to the fenestra ovalis in Silesaurus, several early dinosaurs, and
heropods. However, in Euparkeria the lateral surface of the parabasisphenoid possesses a very
shallow and considerably smaller depression. As a result, although both conditions may be
homologous, I consider that a clear statement about the differences in the character-states of
Euparkeria and dinosauriforms should be made in the text (around page 44). This statement
should seek to keep the informativeness of the presence of the anterior tympanic recess of
dinosauriforms in future phylogenetic analyses, in agreement with the scorings of Nesbitt
2011).
We agree that there are differences between the ATR of Euparkeria and Silesaurus, and these
have been added to the text. However, we do not feel that our statement should keep the
nformativeness of a character supporting a node in a phylogenetic analysis, but the other way
ound: future studies should seek to confirm there is a consistent difference that separate these
clades from Euparkeria but unite them. The statement added reads: “It is however worth noting
hat the ATR of Silesaurus is deeper and larger than that of Euparkeria, with a lateral expansion
of the parabasisphenoid marking its anterior limit [118].”
haven’t noticed other major issues regarding the technical content of the manuscript, but a few
comments and suggestions are included in an edited PDF version of the manuscript. I
encourage the authors to follow them and modify the manuscript accordingly.
These are answered individually below.

Corrected.
Checking the scorings of character 100 of Nesbitt (2011) I infer that he considers that the
median pharyngeal recess is a posteriorly closed fossa on the ventral surface of the
parabasisphenoid. Check if this definition of pharyngeal recess fits with Nesbitt scorings and
how they are distributed among archosauriforms.
We are following the definition of Witmer, who has more extensively worked with braincase
pneumatic recesses, not Nesbitt. We did not really understand this comment.
prefer to have the description of the absence of the intertuberal plate in the section focused on

We think that, by doing so, we would break the information on the median pharyngeal recess

Can you label this "unossified gap" in figure 1E?
We consider labelling this structure in figure 1E would make it very cluttered. It is labelled in
ts line drawing, however, in Figure 2E.
