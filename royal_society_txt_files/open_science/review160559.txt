Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The authors investigated the relationship between stimulus contrast and changes in visual
crowding prior to a saccade. Observers reported the orientation of a Gabor at 15° eccentricity
while they either maintained fixation or executed a saccade to it. The targets were either low or
high contrast, and were presented with or without flankers that were high or low contrast. When
unflanked, observers’ performance was either unchanged (high contrast target) or declined (low
contrast target) prior to saccade onset. With low contrast flankers, performance worsened prior to
saccades; however, saccades seemed to have no clear or systematic effect on identification of a
flanked target when data were normalised by the unflanked performance. The authors conclude
that their data are consistent with effects of saccadic compression and suppression around the
time of a saccade.
The manuscript explores an important question, and it is very well written with the exception of
a few typos. The authors also improve upon limitations of previous work by comparing flanked
performance with unflanked performance prior to each eye movement, computing difference
scores, and using alternative binning analyses. However, the theoretical motivation is quite
unclear, and some previous work has been misinterpreted. There are also interpretations of the
data that are inconsistent.
The Introduction section is largely about peri-saccadic mislocalisations and suppression, leading
me to think that the authors quantified the interaction of these effects and visual crowding; it
would have been good to know if these effects help to explain previous reports (e.g. Harrison et
al, 2013). Instead, the authors manipulated stimulus contrast, known to covary with the
aforementioned effects. Because they did not state their expectations, I was confused as to the
experimental choices of the authors. For example, did the authors choose low contrast flankers
because they thought low contrast flankers were more likely to be suppressed and cause less
crowding, or because they would be compressed and cause more crowding? A priori either result
seems plausible, but without explicit measures of spatial compression nor suppression of the
flankers any interpretations are necessarily post-hoc. The authors appear to agree on lines 336-
337, noting that any interpretation about compression is speculative. The authors do not note that
speculation is similarly required for a suppression interpretation: the authors interpret the
decrease in performance for the unflanked low contrast target (top figure 6) as suppression, but
the authors then interpret that the same contrast stimuli were not suppressed, but instead were
compressed, when presented as flankers. This contradiction is problematic for the conclusions of
the paper, as is the lack of more clear measurements of what is given as the context of the
experiment. It does not seem that the question of the relationship between compression,
suppression and crowding has been addressed, leaving me as uncertain about the role of these
effects as before I read the manuscript.
Regardless of compression and suppression, the authors found no evidence that crowding
strength is weakened prior to a saccade, but that it may be exacerbated, in contrast to our report
(Harrison, Mattingley, & Remington, 2013). (Below I comment on other papers reporting a similar
effect.) Although it is important for this work to be published so as to avoid a potential file-
drawer effect, I do not believe the authors have good evidence that “saccadic uncrowding is not a
genuine effect” (line 385), though this may turn out to be the case with future research. In the
present study, the authors tested only one target-flanker separation. Although we found a
relatively large effect in our first experiment in which we also tested only one target-flanker
separation, we tested a range of separations in a second experiment and found only non-
significant effects at the two smallest target-flanker separations, and no effect at the two largest.
Wolfe and Whitney (2014) and Lin et al (2014) similarly showed that the pre-saccadic changes in
crowding depend on target-flanker separation. It is possible, therefore, that the submitted
experiment did not test over a broad enough range of parameters to find an effect. Indeed, in the
3
“both high” condition which is most similar to that used in our experiments, the performance
data (Figure 4) show a similar trend to our non-significant two small target-flanker conditions
(Figure 3 in Harrison et al). I am not suggesting the authors need to collect more data, but that
they do not have sufficient evidence to assert crowding is unchanged (or not released) prior to a
saccade; these comments need to be moderated.
Lines 347-349, the authors state that Harrison et al did not measure an unflanked baseline
condition. The authors should clarify that we did indeed measure an unflanked baseline
condition, but not during saccade preparation – is this what they mean? The authors further write
(line 355), “…it is inappropriate to make conclusions about crowding without a proper baseline
(unflanked condition) measurement.” What counts as a “proper baseline” is unclear, and seems
to depend on the specific question being asked. Assume the baseline is unflanked performance
measured prior to a saccade; “crowding strength” would remain unchanged by a saccade if
unflanked and flanked performance improved across time by the same amounts, yet such
improvements would be both theoretically interesting and potentially clinically relevant. This
hypothetical result of improved absolute performance but no change in crowding strength would
also not invalidate a claim that, relative to fixation, eye movement preparation alters crowding.
Line 358 onward, the authors state that Harrison et al backward masked their stimuli in both
experiments. This is incorrect: we used forward and backward masks in Experiment 1, and only
forward masks in Experiment 2; see paragraph starting “Stimuli and procedure” on pg 2928 of
our article. This error renders much of the commentary regarding backward masking a non
sequitur. The reference in 53 seems to contain critical information on this topic, and so it’s
unfortunate that paper is not yet published. However, two other studies have provided
conceptual replications of Harrison et al, using crowded faces instead of Gabors (Lin et al., 2014;
Wolfe & Whitney, 2014), and neither study used backward masks. This discussion therefore
needs to be removed or at the least given a more appropriate context.
Line 376 – Contrary to what the authors state, Yildrim et al did not investigate whether there was
a change in crowding strength prior to a saccade. Observers in that study were presented with
two crowded displays well before an eye movement was executed, and were asked to indicate
(with eyes or hand) which of the two contained the target. That is, they had to make their
perceptual decision before they executed the saccade.
In the Discussion, it is not clear to which set of results, Fig 4 or 6, the authors refer, and these
figures give inconsistent results in some cases. I suggest adding more frequent figure number
references to help the reader follow, and some commentary about which analysis should be
weighed more heavily.
Have the authors considered measuring performance for different saccadic errors? We found no
relationship between saccade endpoints and performance, but Wolfe and Whitney did (see Fig.
2F of their paper).
I wonder to what extent the eccentricity of the saccade target influences pre-saccadic changes?
Our study was motivated by the finding that identification of uncrowded targets improves prior
to a saccade, but I'm fairly sure the majority if not all of these study use saccade targets between
~3 - 10 degrees eccentricity; I can't think of a paper reporting an eccentricity effect. I would be
interested to know if the authors are aware of any literature suggesting that saccades influence
target processing similarly throughout the visual field, or if changes are eccentricity dependent.
The statistics section is confusing. For example, on line 138 the author mention planned t-tests,
but I can’t see these reported anywhere (only post-hoc t-tests). Why did you bootstrap the
performance data to derive a mean to enter into the t-test rather than just using the actual mean?
Sincerely,
Will Harrison

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors here examine the interplay between saccadic eye movements and crowding. Recent
studies have suggested that the preparation of a saccade to a crowded object may eradicate
crowding. Here the authors show that this is more likely to be a general performance
improvement than one specific to crowding, and that crowding itself is modulated by contrast
differences between the target and flankers. Overall this is a careful and well-executed study on
an interesting topic, though I have some misgivings about its contribution to the field.
The main issue with the paper is its focus. It is not clear to me what the novel contribution of this
manuscript is, and its message suffers as a result. The introduction is quite clear in terms of
laying out the prior literature on crowding and saccades, as well as the effects of contrast on both.
However, this is not carried throughout the manuscript. In particular, the discussion spends
considerable time focussing on the general effect of contrast on crowding to begin, and then
separately considers the effects of saccades on crowding for much of the rest. In the end it’s not
particularly clear how these results tie together. Though there is some discussion, this needs to be
expanded and made more of a focus of the manuscript.
5
This issue of focus is important because the two key component findings are largely reported by
prior studies. The effects of contrast on crowding have been demonstrated several times in
particular (e.g. Kooi, Toet, Tripathy & Levi, 1994). The effects of saccades on crowding are more
novel, but the authors fall back on a recent publication of theirs for much of the explanatory
strength (Agaoglu, Ögmen & Chung, 2016). These are interesting findings to be sure, and it is
clear to me that this paper expands on the effects of contrast on the interplay between crowding
and saccades, but there is not enough justification of the interaction between these factors to
make clear the contribution of this paper. I suspect part of this may be the null result that the
authors obtained for many of their saccadic effects, but I think these are interesting in light of
recent findings that argued for a release from crowding around the time of saccades (Harrison,
Mattingley & Remington, 2013), so this is not a failing of the paper. The attribution of these effects
largely to making (or unmasking) is convincing, but this is made in the other paper. What does
this paper add to that story? As well as the discussion, this is not made particularly clear in the
abstract either and I would suggest the authors revise each.
I also have several issues/questions surrounding the results and analyses. First, it’s not clear to
me why the effects of contrast and saccades are analysed using different ANOVA tests. The
authors conduct separate one-way ANOVAs (p8) to look at the effects of contrast on unflanked
and flanked performance, and then a separate two-way ANOVA (contrast x time-to-saccadic-
onset) to examine saccadic effects (p9). It is firstly unclear whether this latter ANOVA was
conducted on the flanked or unflanked data. Second, I don’t see why these need to be separate
ANOVA tests – can the authors not run a larger three-way ANOVA with contrast x crowding x
TSO and pull out the main effects, interactions, etc. to examine their data altogether? That would
seem a simpler approach to me rather than the current patchwork. The separation of these
analyses in this way also adds to some of the muddiness around whether contrast, saccades, or
their combination is the focus of the paper.
Second, the authors quite carefully examine the way in which their data is parcelled into different
time bins in the saccade conditions. Part of this involves examining distributions of trials for each
time bin across the different contrast conditions. They are obviously unequal bins and so the
authors conduct alternative analyses. I wonder whether these distributions could explain some of
the interactions between saccades and contrast – were the distributions significantly different
from each other in the different contrast conditions?
Third, more detail is also needed for the presentation of the data in the figures. In figure 3 for
instance there are differently coloured symbols for saccade starting and landing positions but no
legend nor description to tell us which conditions go where (or observers if that is the case?).
Similarly, the calculations to give the z-score differences are unclear – I can’t see whether that the
authors state the direction of this difference. This makes it difficult to discern whether the data
plotted in Figure 4 represents increases or decreases in the amount of crowding. This isn’t
mentioned in text or in the caption that I can see.
Finally there are some typographic errors:
-p1 line 18 “performances” -> “performance” (likewise p11 line 300 and p13 line 352)
-p2 line 33 “effects” -> “affects”
-p6 line 151 “not linear” -> “not a linear”
- p8 line 211 the authors state “post-hoc comparisons showed only one significantly pair” – I
assume this means only “one significant difference”.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
What we have here is failure to replicate Harrison, Mattingley & Remington's (2013) finding that
saccadic preparation reduces crowding.
The study maps orientation acuity performance as a function of pre-saccadic interval under
unflanked and various flanked conditions.
A series of analyses show that for a single condition (low contrast flankers, high contrast target)
performance fails to improve significantly as a function of pre-saccadic interval.
The modified paradigm used here is clearly explained and sets a new standard for the field.
So why the failure to replicate?
One suggestion might be that the target-flanker separations employed here might not be ideal.
This seems unlikely.
Harrison, et al. found presaccadic benefits at 1, 1.5 and 2 degrees separation (7 degrees
separation). As a Bouma fraction this range falls within this range.
7
More plausible explanations might be the vertical variation introduced on each trial in the current
study. From my reading no such variation was used by Harrison, et al.
Moreover, unlike Harrison, et al. who fixed target orientation across the testing period, the
current study varied the local angle in accordance to thresholds measured each day of testing.
I wonder whether the more rigid set of stimulus parameters used by Harrison et al. might have
encouraged their observers to adopt criteria and strategies which may have led to more efficient
performance than is available in the current paradigm.
It seems fair to ask that the authors present more explicitly the various methodological
differences between their study and Harrison et al. (2013), including those I've mentioned.
Minor comments and corrections:
The principled comparison of different binning techniques is fascinating....even if it proved
unimportant in this case.
Line 52: Should be "These radially elongated..."
210-213: I'm confused. The authors seem to be saying that there exits a statistically significant
difference between the z-score differences obtained in the both-high and target-high flankers-low
conditions. Is this correct. In Figure 4 they look indistinguishable.

The authors investigated the relationship between stimulus contrast and changes in visual
crowding prior to a saccade. Observers reported the orientation of a Gabor at 15° eccentricity
while they either maintained fixation or executed a saccade to it. The targets were either low or
high contrast, and were presented with or without flankers that were high or low contrast. When
unflanked, observers’ performance was either unchanged (high contrast target) or declined (low
contrast target) prior to saccade onset. With low contrast flankers, performance worsened prior to
saccades; however, saccades seemed to have no clear or systematic effect on identification of a
flanked target when data were normalised by the unflanked performance. The authors conclude
that their data are consistent with effects of saccadic compression and suppression around the
time of a saccade.
The manuscript explores an important question, and it is very well written with the exception of
a few typos. The authors also improve upon limitations of previous work by comparing flanked

because they thought low contrast flankers were more likely to be suppressed and cause less
crowding, or because they would be compressed and cause more crowding? A priori either result
seems plausible, but without explicit measures of spatial compression nor suppression of the
flankers any interpretations are necessarily post-hoc. The authors appear to agree on lines 336-

Regardless of compression and suppression, the authors found no evidence that crowding

Wolfe and Whitney (2014) and Lin et al (2014) similarly showed that the pre-saccadic changes in

experiment did not test over a broad enough range of parameters to find an effect. Indeed, in the
“both high” condition which is most similar to that used in our experiments, the performance
data (Figure 4) show a similar trend to our non-significant two small target-flanker conditions
(Figure 3 in Harrison et al). I am not suggesting the authors need to collect more data, but that
they do not have sufficient evidence to assert crowding is unchanged (or not released) prior to a
saccade; these comments need to be moderated.
Lines 347-349, the authors state that Harrison et al did not measure an unflanked baseline

hypothetical result of improved absolute performance but no change in crowding strength would
also not invalidate a claim that, relative to fixation, eye movement preparation alters crowding.
Line 358 onward, the authors state that Harrison et al backward masked their stimuli in both

forward masks in Experiment 2; see paragraph starting “Stimuli and procedure” on pg 2928 of

unfortunate that paper is not yet published. However, two other studies have provided
conceptual replications of Harrison et al, using crowded faces instead of Gabors (Lin et al., 2014;

Have the authors considered measuring performance for different saccadic errors? We found no

label_comment_6
The authors here examine the interplay between saccadic eye movements and crowding. Recent
studies have suggested that the preparation of a saccade to a crowded object may eradicate
crowding. Here the authors show that this is more likely to be a general performance
improvement than one specific to crowding, and that crowding itself is modulated by contrast
differences between the target and flankers. Overall this is a careful and well-executed study on
an interesting topic, though I have some misgivings about its contribution to the field.
The main issue with the paper is its focus. It is not clear to me what the novel contribution of this
manuscript is, and its message suffers as a result. The introduction is quite clear in terms of
laying out the prior literature on crowding and saccades, as well as the effects of contrast on both.
However, this is not carried throughout the manuscript. In particular, the discussion spends
considerable time focussing on the general effect of contrast on crowding to begin, and then
separately considers the effects of saccades on crowding for much of the rest. In the end it’s not
12
particularly clear how these results tie together. Though there is some discussion, this needs to be
expanded and made more of a focus of the manuscript.
This issue of focus is important because the two key component findings are largely reported by
prior studies. The effects of contrast on crowding have been demonstrated several times in
particular (e.g. Kooi, Toet, Tripathy & Levi, 1994). The effects of saccades on crowding are more
novel, but the authors fall back on a recent publication of theirs for much of the explanatory
strength (Agaoglu, Ögmen & Chung, 2016). These are interesting findings to be sure, and it is
clear to me that this paper expands on the effects of contrast on the interplay between crowding
and saccades, but there is not enough justification of the interaction between these factors to
make clear the contribution of this paper. I suspect part of this may be the null result that the
authors obtained for many of their saccadic effects, but I think these are interesting in light of
recent findings that argued for a release from crowding around the time of saccades (Harrison,
Mattingley & Remington, 2013), so this is not a failing of the paper. The attribution of these effects
largely to making (or unmasking) is convincing, but this is made in the other paper. What does
this paper add to that story? As well as the discussion, this is not made particularly clear in the
abstract either and I would suggest the authors revise each.
I also have several issues/questions surrounding the results and analyses. First, it’s not clear to
me why the effects of contrast and saccades are analysed using different ANOVA tests. The
authors conduct separate one-way ANOVAs (p8) to look at the effects of contrast on unflanked
and flanked performance, and then a separate two-way ANOVA (contrast x time-to-saccadic-
onset) to examine saccadic effects (p9). It is firstly unclear whether this latter ANOVA was
conducted on the flanked or unflanked data. Second, I don’t see why these need to be separate
ANOVA tests – can the authors not run a larger three-way ANOVA with contrast x crowding x
TSO and pull out the main effects, interactions, etc. to examine their data altogether? That would
seem a simpler approach to me rather than the current patchwork. The separation of these
analyses in this way also adds to some of the muddiness around whether contrast, saccades, or
their combination is the focus of the paper.
Second, the authors quite carefully examine the way in which their data is parcelled into different
time bins in the saccade conditions. Part of this involves examining distributions of trials for each
time bin across the different contrast conditions. They are obviously unequal bins and so the
authors conduct alternative analyses. I wonder whether these distributions could explain some of
the interactions between saccades and contrast – were the distributions significantly different
from each other in the different contrast conditions?
Third, more detail is also needed for the presentation of the data in the figures. In figure 3 for
instance there are differently coloured symbols for saccade starting and landing positions but no
legend nor description to tell us which conditions go where (or observers if that is the case?).
Similarly, the calculations to give the z-score differences are unclear – I can’t see whether that the
authors state the direction of this difference. This makes it difficult to discern whether the data
plotted in Figure 4 represents increases or decreases in the amount of crowding. This isn’t
mentioned in text or in the caption that I can see.
Finally there are some typographic errors:
-p1 line 18 “performances” -> “performance” (likewise p11 line 300 and p13 line 352)
-p2 line 33 “effects” -> “affects”
-p6 line 151 “not linear” -> “not a linear”
- p8 line 211 the authors state “post-hoc comparisons showed only one significantly pair” – I
assume this means only “one significant difference”.

What we have here is failure to replicate Harrison, Mattingley & Remington's (2013) finding that
saccadic preparation reduces crowding.
The study maps orientation acuity performance as a function of pre-saccadic interval under
unflanked and various flanked conditions.
A series of analyses show that for a single condition (low contrast flankers, high contrast target)
performance fails to improve significantly as a function of pre-saccadic interval.
The modified paradigm used here is clearly explained and sets a new standard for the field.
So why the failure to replicate?
One suggestion might be that the target-flanker separations employed here might not be ideal.
This seems unlikely.
Harrison, et al. found presaccadic benefits at 1, 1.5 and 2 degrees separation (7 degrees
separation). As a Bouma fraction this range falls within this range.
More plausible explanations might be the vertical variation introduced on each trial in the current
study. From my reading no such variation was used by Harrison, et al.
Moreover, unlike Harrison, et al. who fixed target orientation across the testing period, the
current study varied the local angle in accordance to thresholds measured each day of testing.
I wonder whether the more rigid set of stimulus parameters used by Harrison et al. might have
encouraged their observers to adopt criteria and strategies which may have led to more efficient
performance than is available in the current paradigm.
It seems fair to ask that the authors present more explicitly the various methodological
differences between their study and Harrison et al. (2013), including those I've mentioned.
Minor comments and corrections:
The principled comparison of different binning techniques is fascinating....even if it proved
unimportant in this case.
Line 52: Should be "These radially elongated..."
210-213: I'm confused. The authors seem to be saying that there exits a statistically significant
difference between the z-score differences obtained in the both-high and target-high flankers-low
conditions. Is this correct. In Figure 4 they look indistinguishable.

The authors do not appear to have addressed some of my main concerns, perhaps because I was
not clear enough in my first review. First, I was concerned that the lack of clarity in stimulus
choices makes interpretation of the data difficult. To explain the decrease in performance for the
unflanked low-contrast condition, the authors suggest suppression of the target. Unless I am
mistaken, the same contrast was used for the flankers-low conditions. In the target-high flankers
low condition, performance decreases with TSO. The authors speculate this is due to compression
of the low contrast flankers. So in one case a stimulus with a given attribute is suppressed, but in
another case it’s mislocalised. (Note that the decrease in performance for the both-low condition
could be explained by the worsening of the unflanked target.) The authors have not addressed
this contradiction. In their reply to my review, however, they stress that they already discussed in
detail why they think compression doesn’t explain unflanked performance, and yet it is this post-
hoc interpretation that is problematic considering neither compression nor suppression were
measured, and no clear expectation was given a priori for how the stimuli would be affected.
Again: why would the low-contrast flankers not be suppressed (on at least some trials, as we may
expect from e.g. Michels and Lappe) and release crowding? If the flankers are not suppressed
(but instead are compressed), why was the unflanked target suppressed?
15
Second, I suggested that crowding is more appropriately defined as a change in performance
with target-flanker distance, and it is possible the submitted study may have uncovered other
changes in crowding had they measured more target-flanker separations. The authors have
provided an informative summary of the parameters used across previous studies – I encourage
them to present this in tabular format because it provides a fantastic summary. Due to the
correspondence between the configural choices in the present study and our and others’
experiment, the authors state that small differences across study designs are “unlikely to be the
cause of the disagreement of results” (line 566). It is not the small differences I was concerned
about, but the one-shot characterisation of crowding. It is well understood that the extent of
crowding can vary greatly from person to person (Petrov & Meleshkevich, 2011; Toet & Levi,
1992), and so there’s not a clear reason to expect highly similar performance across studies even if
stimulus parameters were perfectly equated with previous studies. It remains an open empirical
question as to whether improvements in crowded performance would have occurred for other
target-flanker separations. I think this point needs to be acknowledged.
The new paragraph in the Introduction provides what I think is much needed context for this
study. However, the authors cite van Koningsbruggen and Buonocore’s commentary on our
earlier paper, but yet they don’t reference our reply to their commentary. In our reply (Harrison,
Mattingley, & Remington, 2013a), we highlight a number of points regarding the design and
results of our study that van Koningsbruggen and Buonocore seem to have overlooked, and
similar problems of logic remain in the present revised manuscript. Most importantly, our
original results showed an interaction between target-flanker spacing and eye movement, and so
pre-saccade “attention”, whatever that means, cannot account for our data (by the same logic, nor
can unmasking). I also do not think it’s appropriate to cite the conference abstract in reference 37,
which I know has many problems with its design and conclusions.
This result – that eye movement preparation affected performance differently across target-
flanker spacings – is critical. This finding largely addresses one of the main criticisms in the
present manuscript: that a “proper baseline” needs to be measured (line 402). Although we did
not measure unflanked performance during eye movement preparation, we did measure
crowded performance with very distant flankers and found no change in performance. This
result seems to be ignored by the authors, but it largely contradicts their speculations about the
cause of our results (see also Harrison et al 2013a). On lines 64 – 66 they state that we could not
conclude anything about crowding strength; but we can conclude that the area over which
crowding occurs changes, which to me seems analogous. I suggest the authors consider whether
a more appropriate baseline is pre-saccadic unflanked performance or pre-saccadic crowding
across target-flanker spacings (or both). This problem needs to be addressed in the manuscript. It
is disappointing the authors have also ignored this critical finding in their recent paper (Agaoglu,
Ögmen, & Chung, 2016). (This prior work also incorrectly states that unmasking can explain a
finding in our other paper (Harrison, Retell, Remington, & Mattingley, 2013b), in which we
actually found a worsening of performance – the authors seem confused about what we found
across different studies.)
(It seems something quite different from simple unmasking or “pre-saccadic attention” caused
our original finding. To play devil’s advocate, if our result does not show a genuine reduction in
crowding due to the eye movement per se, there must be at least an interaction with our stimulus
choices and the crowding zone – a simple main effect of masking, attention, whatever, cannot
explain what we found. In reference to line 563, the authors may also find it useful to know that,
after performing the permutation analyses we showed in our main Figure 3, I compared
performance for the no-saccade and the final time bin with a t-test, which came out significant for
all three smallest target-flanker spacings. However, I opted to report only the more conservative
permutation analyses to be more cautious.)
Another concern I have which I did not mention in my previous review is the lack of an
improvement in performance for the unflanked target. Finding better perceptual uncrowded
performance immediately before a saccade seems quite a robust result (a non exhaustive list of
16
papers includes Deubel, 2008; Deubel & Schneider, 1996; Kowler, Anderson, Dosher, & Blaser,
1995; Remington, 1980; Rolfs & Carrasco, 2012; Rolfs, Jonikaitis, Deubel, & Cavanagh, 2011).
However, upon re-visiting these studies as well as others, I found that they all use forward or
backward masks, if not both. In the case of these experiments, unmasking effects could play an
important role, but this does not seem to be acknowledged previously. I wonder if the authors
could comment on this potential problem in the context of the current study? Regardless, one
recent study did find improved performance at the saccade goal without the use of forward or
backward masks (Li, Barbot, & Carrasco, 2016). The lack of finding improved performance at the
saccade goal for even unflanked targets need to be commented on in the present manuscript,
given the body of prior positive findings.
Lines 523 – 525: I had to work hard to understand out how floor effects may be a culprit. If I
understand correctly, the authors are referring to the fact that crowding strength appears to
diminish in the target-low flankers-high condition because unflanked performance worsened,
whereas flanked performance remained the same. I think this is worth being explicit about.
For my review I’m also asked to comment on the accessibility of the supporting data. I tried the
link offered by the authors, but it doesn’t seem to lead to anything.
Finally, one small request: I would very much appreciate it if the authors could indicate where in
the revised manuscript changes have been made to facilitate tracking their attempts to clarify
issues.

My main issue with the initial submission was that the focus of the manuscript was not entirely
clear. The authors have now taken steps to improve this, and the specific contribution of the
manuscript to our understanding of crowding and the link with saccadic eye movements is now
much more clear. However, not all of the alterations to the manuscript are improvements, in my
opinion.
The discussion in particular is now exceedingly long, with extremely detailed descriptions of
prior studies that have investigated crowding and saccades. Four prior studies are given several
paragraphs each, beginning in each case with tedious amounts of detail to describe the studies
(stimulus sizes, eccentricity values, presentation times, etc.) which in most cases are never
referred to again. In cases where these parameters are deemed relevant to the discussion, they are
re-stated subsequently in any case (e.g. with eccentricity values). I suggest the discussion needs to
be cut back substantially, leaving only the details that are pertinent to the discussion. The level of
detail used to describe the authors previous work (Agaoglu et al 2016) is appropriate, and I
would take this as a guide. If the authors really wish to have this comparison of parameters laid
out, then a simple table of these values would surely suffice, rather than filling the text with
needless detail. Otherwise it once more obscures the focus of the paper.
Minor issues
-p2 line 28 – photoreceptors are described as having larger receptive fields in peripheral vision.
My understanding is that photoreceptors do not vary in receptive field size and that this is only
evident in subsequent levels from retinal ganglion cells onwards. A reference is needed here in
any case.
-A range of grammatical errors still remain:
18
-p11 line 316 should be ‘statistically identical’.
-There are still instances of the word ‘performances’ (lines 333 and 336) – in the context of data,
performance is an uncountable noun. Performances are concerts.
-p19 line 552 should be “the closest separations” and p19 line 554 “of the fraction”.

permutation analyses to be more cautious.)
Another concern I have which I did not mention in my previous review is the lack of an
improvement in performance for the unflanked target. Finding better perceptual uncrowded
performance immediately before a saccade seems quite a robust result (a non exhaustive list of
papers includes Deubel, 2008; Deubel & Schneider, 1996; Kowler, Anderson, Dosher, & Blaser,
1995; Remington, 1980; Rolfs & Carrasco, 2012; Rolfs, Jonikaitis, Deubel, & Cavanagh, 2011).
However, upon re-visiting these studies as well as others, I found that they all use forward or
backward masks, if not both. In the case of these experiments, unmasking effects could play an
important role, but this does not seem to be acknowledged previously. I wonder if the authors
could comment on this potential problem in the context of the current study? Regardless, one
recent study did find improved performance at the saccade goal without the use of forward or
backward masks (Li, Barbot, & Carrasco, 2016). The lack of finding improved performance at the
saccade goal for even unflanked targets need to be commented on in the present manuscript,
given the body of prior positive findings.
Lines 523 – 525: I had to work hard to understand out how floor effects may be a culprit. If I
understand correctly, the authors are referring to the fact that crowding strength appears to
diminish in the target-low flankers-high condition because unflanked performance worsened,
whereas flanked performance remained the same. I think this is worth being explicit about.
For my review I’m also asked to comment on the accessibility of the supporting data. I tried the
link offered by the authors, but it doesn’t seem to lead to anything.
Finally, one small request: I would very much appreciate it if the authors could indicate where in
the revised manuscript changes have been made to facilitate tracking their attempts to clarify
issues.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_12
My main issue with the initial submission was that the focus of the manuscript was not entirely
clear. The authors have now taken steps to improve this, and the specific contribution of the
manuscript to our understanding of crowding and the link with saccadic eye movements is now
much more clear. However, not all of the alterations to the manuscript are improvements, in my
opinion.
The discussion in particular is now exceedingly long, with extremely detailed descriptions of
prior studies that have investigated crowding and saccades. Four prior studies are given several
paragraphs each, beginning in each case with tedious amounts of detail to describe the studies
(stimulus sizes, eccentricity values, presentation times, etc.) which in most cases are never
referred to again. In cases where these parameters are deemed relevant to the discussion, they are
re-stated subsequently in any case (e.g. with eccentricity values). I suggest the discussion needs to
be cut back substantially, leaving only the details that are pertinent to the discussion. The level of
detail used to describe the authors previous work (Agaoglu et al 2016) is appropriate, and I
would take this as a guide. If the authors really wish to have this comparison of parameters laid
out, then a simple table of these values would surely suffice, rather than filling the text with
needless detail. Otherwise it once more obscures the focus of the paper.
Minor issues
-p2 line 28 – photoreceptors are described as having larger receptive fields in peripheral vision.
My understanding is that photoreceptors do not vary in receptive field size and that this is only
evident in subsequent levels from retinal ganglion cells onwards. A reference is needed here in
any case.
-A range of grammatical errors still remain:
-p11 line 316 should be ‘statistically identical’.
-There are still instances of the word ‘performances’ (lines 333 and 336) – in the context of data,
performance is an uncountable noun. Performances are concerts.
-p19 line 552 should be “the closest separations” and p19 line 554 “of the fraction”.

Reviewer: 1
The authors investigated the relationship between stimulus contrast and changes in
visual crowding prior to a saccade. Observers reported the orientation of a Gabor at
15° eccentricity while they either maintained fixation or executed a saccade to it. The
targets were either low or high contrast, and were presented with or without flankers
that were high or low contrast. When unflanked, observers’ performance was either
unchanged (high contrast target) or declined (low contrast target) prior to saccade
onset. With low contrast flankers, performance worsened prior to saccades; however,
saccades seemed to have no clear or systematic effect on identification of a flanked
target when data were normalized by the unflanked performance. The authors
conclude that their data are consistent with effects of saccadic compression and
suppression around the time of a saccade.
The manuscript explores an important question, and it is very well written with the
exception of a few typos. The authors also improve upon limitations of previous work
by comparing flanked performance with unflanked performance prior to each eye
movement, computing difference scores, and using alternative binning analyses.
nk you!
However, the theoretical motivation is quite unclear, and some previous work has been
misinterpreted. There are also interpretations of the data that are inconsistent. The
Introduction section is largely about peri-saccadic mislocalizations and suppression,
leading me to think that the authors quantified the interaction of these effects and
visual crowding; it would have been good to know if these effects help to explain
previous reports (e.g. Harrison et al, 2013). Instead, the authors manipulated stimulus
contrast, known to covary with the aforementioned effects. Because they did not state
their expectations, I was confused as to the experimental choices of the authors. For
example, did the authors choose low contrast flankers because they thought low
contrast flankers were more likely to be suppressed and cause less crowding, or
because they would be compressed and cause more crowding? A priori either result
seems plausible, but without explicit measures of spatial compression nor suppression
of the flankers any interpretations are necessarily post-hoc. The authors appear to
agree on lines 336-337, noting that any interpretation about compression is
speculative. The authors do not note that speculation is similarly required for a
suppression interpretation: the authors interpret the decrease in performance for the
unflanked low contrast target (top figure 6) as suppression, but the authors then
interpret that the same contrast stimuli were not suppressed, but instead were
compressed, when presented as flankers. This contradiction is problematic for the
conclusions of the paper, as is the lack of more clear measurements of what is given as
the context of the experiment. It does not seem that the question of the relationship
between compression, suppression and crowding has been addressed, leaving me as
uncertain about the role of these effects as before I read the manuscript.
thank the reviewer for the comment. We have now clarified in the text that the primary aim of the
sent study was to examine the relationship between pre-saccadic crowding and stimulus contrast.
ough the present study was not aimed at replicating Harrison et al.’s study on saccadic uncrowding,
are happy to address the reviewer’s criticism on the rationale of our study.
he introduction of the original manuscript, we outlined previous research showing contrast-
endent mislocalization and suppression before saccades. Since it is also known that contrast
ilarity affects crowding, we think that investigation of the link between these processes is justified. It
nalogous to looking for a saccadic release of crowding based on the literature indicating that there is
mpulsory shift of attention to the saccade target [1], V4 and FEF receptive fields get shrunk and
verge toward saccade target [2,3]. These findings do justify investigation of what happens to
wding before saccades. Indeed, these findings seem to be the starting point which justified the
ewer and his colleagues’ study on saccadic uncrowding (see Introduction of [4]). However, the
ewer and his colleagues did not attempt to quantify the effect of attention before saccades, nor did
y control for it by measuring performance with isolated targets. Obviously, they also did not measure
ral activity to tie the various neural processes to saccadic changes in percepts. However, they rightly
culated that the effect they found might be explained by shrinkage and convergence of receptive
ds of V4 cells [4]. These claims seem reasonable but following the logic presented above by the
ewer, their study leaves one uncertain about the role of these effects as before one reads the
nuscript. However, we think that the investigation of crowding before saccades was completely
ranted. Our study was a fruit of a similar thought process.
arding the specific point raised by the reviewer: As we discussed in detail in the original manuscript,
think that it is highly unlikely that compression would be responsible for the reduction in
formance when the target had low contrast and was presented alone. We cited several studies
wing no change in the perceived size of saccade targets before saccades. On the other hand, saccadic
pression seems to be the best candidate for performance reduction for low-contrast isolated target.
ertheless, we have expanded the Introduction and Discussion in the revised manuscript to clarify
se issues.
Regardless of compression and suppression, the authors found no evidence that
crowding strength is weakened prior to a saccade, but that it may be exacerbated, in
contrast to our report (Harrison, Mattingley, & Remington, 2013). (Below I comment
on other papers reporting a similar effect.) Although it is important for this work to be
published so as to avoid a potential file-drawer effect, I do not believe the authors have
good evidence that “saccadic uncrowding is not a genuine effect” (line 385), though
this may turn out to be the case with future research. In the present study, the authors
tested only one target-flanker separation. Although we found a relatively large effect
in our first experiment in which we also tested only one target-flanker separation, we
tested a range of separations in a second experiment and found only non-significant
effects at the two smallest target-flanker separations, and no effect at the two largest.
Wolfe and Whitney (2014) and Lin et al (2014) similarly showed that the pre-saccadic
changes in crowding depend on target-flanker separation. It is possible, therefore, that
the submitted experiment did not test over a broad enough range of parameters to
find an effect. Indeed, in the “both high” condition which is most similar to that used
in our experiments, the performance data (Figure 4) show a similar trend to our non-
significant two small target-flanker conditions (Figure 3 in Harrison et al). I am not
suggesting the authors need to collect more data, but that they do not have sufficient
evidence to assert crowding is unchanged (or not released) prior to a saccade; these
comments need to be moderated.
have listed all the eccentricities used in each and every single experiment in the studies of Harrison
l., Wolfe and Whitney (2014) and Lin et al. (2014), and compared them with the eccentricities used
ur previous paper (Agaoglu et al, 2016) and the present study in the Discussion (see the section The
sent Study). In addition, we also expressed the target-flanker separation as a fraction of the
entricity for all these studies. In short, the eccentricities (8 and 15 deg), as well as the ratios between
et-flanker separation and eccentricity we used in our previous study and the present study fall right
he ranges reported by Harrison et al., Wolfe and Whitney (2014) and Lin et al. (2014). Thus we do
believe that the differences in eccentricity or the fact that we only tested one target-flanker
aration were the main culprit of the discrepancy in findings.
Lines 347-349, the authors state that Harrison et al did not measure an unflanked
baseline condition. The authors should clarify that we did indeed measure an unflanked
baseline condition, but not during saccade preparation – is this what they mean? The
authors further write (line 355), “…it is inappropriate to make conclusions about
crowding without a proper baseline (unflanked condition) measurement.” What counts
as a “proper baseline” is unclear, and seems to depend on the specific question being
asked. Assume the baseline is unflanked performance measured prior to a saccade;
“crowding strength” would remain unchanged by a saccade if unflanked and flanked
performance improved across time by the same amounts, yet such improvements
would be both theoretically interesting and potentially clinically relevant. This
hypothetical result of improved absolute performance but no change in crowding
strength would also not invalidate a claim that, relative to fixation, eye movement
preparation alters crowding.
proper baseline” we meant measuring unflanked performance before saccades. Unfortunately, this
n important point missed by almost all studies on pre-saccadic crowding (see below). We agree that
ing similar improvements or impairments in unflanked and flanked recognition performance before
cades is not useless. It does inform theories of neural processing and perisaccadic perception.
wever, it may well show that these changes are not specific to crowded displays and hence,
wding itself is not affected by these processes.
Line 358 onward, the authors state that Harrison et al backward masked their stimuli
in both experiments. This is incorrect: we used forward and backward masks in
Experiment 1, and only forward masks in Experiment 2; see paragraph starting “Stimuli
and procedure” on pg 2928 of our article. This error renders much of the commentary
regarding backward masking a non sequitur. The reference in 53 seems to contain
critical information on this topic, and so it’s unfortunate that paper is not yet published.
However, two other studies have provided conceptual replications of Harrison et al,
using crowded faces instead of Gabors (Lin et al., 2014; Wolfe & Whitney, 2014), and
neither study used backward masks. This discussion therefore needs to be removed or
at the least given a more appropriate context.
t, we would like to apologize for incorrectly referring the mask as a backward mask (instead of a
ward mask, which is now corrected in the revised text) in Experiment 2 of the reviewer’s paper.
wever, as more recent studies showed, saccadic unmasking occurs for both forward and backward
ks (e.g., [5]). Since our study was not directly aimed at testing whether saccadic uncrowding is a
uine effect or not, we had not listed this as part of the rationale but brought up this issue only in the
ussion in the original manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we included this test as a secondary aim
e although it does not directly test the genuineness of saccadic uncrowding, it does provide
itional evidence regarding it. We are also glad that the reviewer brought up two closely related
dies [6,7]. In the revised Discussion, we discussed in detail the similarities and differences among
dies, including the use of masks.
Line 376 – Contrary to what the authors state, Yildirim et al did not investigate whether
there was a change in crowding strength prior to a saccade. Observers in that study
were presented with two crowded displays well before an eye movement was
executed, and were asked to indicate (with eyes or hand) which of the two contained
the target. That is, they had to make their perceptual decision before they executed
the saccade.
thank the reviewer for the comment. We have removed the sentence in this revision as it is not
tral to our argument.
In the Discussion, it is not clear to which set of results, Fig 4 or 6, the authors refer, and
these figures give inconsistent results in some cases. I suggest adding more frequent
figure number references to help the reader follow, and some commentary about
which analysis should be weighed more heavily.
added more references to figures in the revised Discussion. Regarding the analysis methods, it is a
of a personal choice to decide how to weigh them since each method has pros and cons, which we
d in the manuscript. Readers with a background in classical methods might choose to weigh them
er, and others who prefer more contemporary methods may weigh the frequency binning and
mutation analysis more.
se also see the change we did in Figure 4 bottom panel. The results for the target-high flankers-low
the both-low conditions were accidentally swapped in the original manuscript (we had created
re 4 manually from individual panels, which led to this mistake). Part of the inconsistency the
ewer mentioned might be due to this.
Have the authors considered measuring performance for different saccadic errors? We
found no relationship between saccade endpoints and performance, but Wolfe and
Whitney did (see Fig. 2F of their paper).
also did not find any effect of saccadic errors here. The same applies to our previous study where we
re explicitly investigated pre-saccadic uncrowding (see Supplementary Results in [8]).
I wonder to what extent the eccentricity of the saccade target influences pre-saccadic
changes? Our study was motivated by the finding that identification of uncrowded
targets improves prior to a saccade, but I'm fairly sure the majority if not all of these
study use saccade targets between ~3 - 10 degrees eccentricity; I can't think of a paper
reporting an eccentricity effect. I would be interested to know if the authors are aware
of any literature suggesting that saccades influence target processing similarly
throughout the visual field, or if changes are eccentricity dependent.
addressed this point in the revised Discussion (under the section The Present Study).
The statistics section is confusing. For example, on line 138 the author mention planned
t-tests, but I can’t see these reported anywhere (only post-hoc t-tests). Why did you
bootstrap the performance data to derive a mean to enter into the t-test rather than
just using the actual mean?
short answer is that since the expectation of a linear combination of random variables is equal to
linear combination of expectations, estimating the population mean by arithmetic mean and by
tstrapping for mean are theoretically identical. In practice, the difference was in the first or second
ificant digit after the decimal point. All paired t-tests reported in the manuscript, except the ones we
licitly noted as post-hoc multiple comparisons, are pre-planned tests.
Reviewer: 2
The authors here examine the interplay between saccadic eye movements and
crowding. Recent studies have suggested that the preparation of a saccade to a
crowded object may eradicate crowding. Here the authors show that this is more likely
to be a general performance improvement than one specific to crowding, and that
crowding itself is modulated by contrast differences between the target and flankers.
Overall this is a careful and well-executed study on an interesting topic, though I have
some misgivings about its contribution to the field.
The main issue with the paper is its focus. It is not clear to me what the novel
contribution of this manuscript is, and its message suffers as a result. The introduction
is quite clear in terms of laying out the prior literature on crowding and saccades, as
well as the effects of contrast on both. However, this is not carried throughout the
manuscript. In particular, the discussion spends considerable time focusing on the
general effect of contrast on crowding to begin, and then separately considers the
effects of saccades on crowding for much of the rest. In the end it’s not particularly
clear how these results tie together. Though there is some discussion, this needs to be
expanded and made more of a focus of the manuscript.
This issue of focus is important because the two key component findings are largely
reported by prior studies. The effects of contrast on crowding have been demonstrated
several times in particular (e.g. Kooi, Toet, Tripathy & Levi, 1994). The effects of
saccades on crowding are more novel, but the authors fall back on a recent publication
of theirs for much of the explanatory strength (Agaoglu, Ögmen & Chung, 2016). These
are interesting findings to be sure, and it is clear to me that this paper expands on the
effects of contrast on the interplay between crowding and saccades, but there is not
enough justification of the interaction between these factors to make clear the
contribution of this paper. I suspect part of this may be the null result that the authors
obtained for many of their saccadic effects, but I think these are interesting in light of
recent findings that argued for a release from crowding around the time of saccades
(Harrison, Mattingley & Remington, 2013), so this is not a failing of the paper. The
attribution of these effects largely to making (or unmasking) is convincing, but this is
made in the other paper. What does this paper add to that story? As well as the
discussion, this is not made particularly clear in the abstract either and I would suggest
the authors revise each.
extensively expanded the Introduction and Discussion in the revised manuscript to clarify the
mary and secondary purposes of the present study and its contributions to the current understanding
re-saccadic changes in cluttered displays. We have also revised the abstract.
I also have several issues/questions surrounding the results and analyses. First, it’s not
clear to me why the effects of contrast and saccades are analyzed using different
ANOVA tests. The authors conduct separate one-way ANOVAs (p8) to look at the
effects of contrast on unflanked and flanked performance, and then a separate two-
way ANOVA (contrast x time-to-saccadic-onset) to examine saccadic effects (p9). It is
firstly unclear whether this latter ANOVA was conducted on the flanked or unflanked
data. Second, I don’t see why these need to be separate ANOVA tests – can the authors
not run a larger three-way ANOVA with contrast x crowding x TSO and pull out the
main effects, interactions, etc. to examine their data altogether? That would seem a
simpler approach to me rather than the current patchwork. The separation of these
analyses in this way also adds to some of the muddiness around whether contrast,
saccades, or their combination is the focus of the paper.
to the nature of experimental conditions, it is hard to perform a three-way ANOVA. For instance,
reviewer suggests a test with contrast, crowding, and TSO as the main factors. However, assuming
t the levels of the crowding main effect is flanked vs unflanked (i.e., crowded or not), and the levels
he contrast main effect is low vs high (based on the target), it is unclear how different contrasts for
kers can be incorporated in this test. Also, when looking at the crowding based on z-score
erences, we think that a two-way ANOVA with contrast combination (based on both the target and
ker contrast) and TSO is a more proper way of analysis. A similar main effect (i.e., the contrast
bination) cannot be used in a three-way ANOVA since the unflanked conditions will not have any
e for flanker contrast.
Second, the authors quite carefully examine the way in which their data is parceled
into different time bins in the saccade conditions. Part of this involves examining
distributions of trials for each time bin across the different contrast conditions. They
are obviously unequal bins and so the authors conduct alternative analyses. I wonder
whether these distributions could explain some of the interactions between saccades
and contrast – were the distributions significantly different from each other in the
different contrast conditions?
hown in Figure 5, the distributions of trials in different contrast conditions were pretty similar.
thermore, we had performed frequency binning and permutation analysis to address this potential
ct. Based on these, we think that it is unlikely to explain our findings.
Third, more detail is also needed for the presentation of the data in the figures. In figure
3 for instance there are differently colored symbols for saccade starting and landing
positions but no legend nor description to tell us which conditions go where (or
observers if that is the case?). Similarly, the calculations to give the z-score differences
are unclear – I can’t see whether that the authors state the direction of this difference.
This makes it difficult to discern whether the data plotted in Figure 4 represents
increases or decreases in the amount of crowding. This isn’t mentioned in text or in the
caption that I can see.
clarified the caption of figure 3. We subtracted the z-scores for flanked performance from the z-
res for the unflanked performance. We clarified this point in the revised manuscript.
Finally there are some typographic errors:
-p1 line 18 “performances” -> “performance” (likewise p11 line 300 and p13 line 352)
-p2 line 33 “effects” -> “affects”
-p6 line 151 “not linear” -> “not a linear”
- p8 line 211 the authors state “post-hoc comparisons showed only one significantly
pair” – I assume this means only “one significant difference”.
nged as suggested. Thank you.
Reviewer: 3
What we have here is failure to replicate Harrison, Mattingley & Remington's (2013)
finding that saccadic preparation reduces crowding.
The study maps orientation acuity performance as a function of pre-saccadic interval
under unflanked and various flanked conditions.
A series of analyses show that for a single condition (low contrast flankers, high
contrast target) performance fails to improve significantly as a function of pre-saccadic
interval.
The modified paradigm used here is clearly explained and sets a new standard for the
field.
So why the failure to replicate?
One suggestion might be that the target-flanker separations employed here might not
be ideal.
This seems unlikely.
Harrison, et al. found presaccadic benefits at 1, 1.5 and 2 degrees separation (7
degrees separation). As a Bouma fraction this range falls within this range.
More plausible explanations might be the vertical variation introduced on each trial in
the current study. From my reading no such variation was used by Harrison, et al.
oth Harrison et al.’ study (p. 2928 in [4]), and other reports of pre-saccadic uncrowding [6,7], the
uli were randomly jittered ±1deg vertically (also horizontally in [6]) across trials. Therefore, this
ical variation cannot explain our results.
Moreover, unlike Harrison, et al. who fixed target orientation across the testing period,
the current study varied the local angle in accordance to thresholds measured each day
of testing.
I wonder whether the more rigid set of stimulus parameters used by Harrison et al.
might have encouraged their observers to adopt criteria and strategies which may
have led to more efficient performance than is available in the current paradigm.
certainly possible, however, as shown in Figure 2 and mentioned in line 208 in the revised
nuscript, the change in threshold tilts over time was not significant.
It seems fair to ask that the authors present more explicitly the various methodological
differences between their study and Harrison et al. (2013), including those I've
mentioned.
se see the revised Discussion, where we discuss in detail all previous work on pre-saccadic
rowding.
Minor comments and corrections:
The principled comparison of different binning techniques is fascinating....even if it
proved unimportant in this case.

210-213: I'm confused. The authors seem to be saying that there exists a statistically
significant difference between the z-score differences obtained in the both-high and
target-high flankers-low conditions. Is this correct. In Figure 4 they look
indistinguishable.

kers-low condition, 0.697 in the target-low flankers-high condition, and 0.630 in the both-low
dition. However, we made a mistake in Figure 4 bottom panel in the original manuscript: the panels
the target-high flankers-low and the both-low conditions were accidentally swapped (this figure was
nually created from individual panels). We corrected this mistake in the revised manuscript. Thank
for raising this point.

sponse to comments
thank both reviewers and the associate editor for their comments and suggestions. We made
eral changes to our manuscript according to these suggestions, and responded to some of the
cerns raised by the reviewers in this document.
Associate Editor:
1) Clearly acknowledge, as Dr Harrison has requested, the limitations of their study (notably
that they only test one target flanker separation condition).
had already acknowledged this limitation of our study in the previous revision. Please see lines 548-
in the revised manuscript.
2) They criticise Dr Harrison's previous paper for not having a baseline (target only condition),
but if Dr Harrison measured performance when flankers were very far away and found no
change in performance, I think this is akin to a baseline (which is the point he was making in
his latest review). They should acknowledge/discuss this.
removed our criticism of Dr. Harrison’s work based on having a baseline in the revised manuscript
deleted lines 387-392 and 400). However, to avoid lengthening our manuscript, we listed in this
ument (see below) our point of view about using a large target-flanker spacing as a baseline in
mating crowding zones.
3) Comment on the lack of improvement for the unflanked target. I don’t think this is a big deal,
its more about commenting on an unusual finding."
se see our response (2) to Dr. Harrison’s comments below.
Dr. Harrison:
The authors do not appear to have addressed some of my main concerns, perhaps because I was
not clear enough in my first review. First, I was concerned that the lack of clarity in stimulus
choices makes interpretation of the data difficult.
had already included our rationale for using Gabors and different contrast conditions in the
oduction section of our manuscript (see lines 50-61 and 80-85 in the revised manuscript).
To explain the decrease in performance for the unflanked low-contrast condition, the authors
suggest suppression of the target. Unless I am mistaken, the same contrast was used for the
flankers-low conditions. In the target-high flankers low condition, performance decreases with
TSO. The authors speculate this is due to compression of the low contrast flankers. So in one case
a stimulus with a given attribute is suppressed, but in another case it’s mislocalised. (Note that
the decrease in performance for the both-low condition could be explained by the worsening of
the unflanked target.) The authors have not addressed this contradiction. In their reply to my
review, however, they stress that they already discussed in detail why they think compression
doesn’t explain unflanked performance, and yet it is this post-hoc interpretation that is
problematic considering neither compression nor suppression were measured, and no clear
expectation was given a priori for how the stimuli would be affected. Again: why would the low-
contrast flankers not be suppressed (on at least some trials, as we may expect from e.g. Michels
and Lappe) and release crowding? If the flankers are not suppressed (but instead are
compressed), why was the unflanked target suppressed?
Another concern I have which I did not mention in my previous review is the lack of an
improvement in performance for the unflanked target. Finding better perceptual uncrowded
performance immediately before a saccade seems quite a robust result (a non exhaustive list of
papers includes Deubel, 2008; Deubel & Schneider, 1996; Kowler, Anderson, Dosher, & Blaser,
1995; Remington, 1980; Rolfs & Carrasco, 2012; Rolfs, Jonikaitis, Deubel, & Cavanagh, 2011).
However, upon re-visiting these studies as well as others, I found that they all use forward or
backward masks, if not both. In the case of these experiments, unmasking effects could play an
important role, but this does not seem to be acknowledged previously. I wonder if the authors
could comment on this potential problem in the context of the current study? Regardless, one
recent study did find improved performance at the saccade goal without the use of forward or
backward masks (Li, Barbot, & Carrasco, 2016). The lack of finding improved performance at the
saccade goal for even unflanked targets need to be commented on in the present manuscript,
given the body of prior positive findings.
will address these two seemingly different but highly relevant concerns raised by the reviewer.
t, Dr. Harrison suggested that our interpretation of decreasing performance in the low-contrast
anked condition is flawed because saccadic suppression should account for the performance drops
n either the target or the flankers have low contrast. Second, he requested an explanation for the
of improved performance in the unflanked conditions. Our responses are given below.
e addressed this point in the previous revision but perhaps we were not clear enough in our
soning. Dr. Harrison suggested that the impaired performance in the unflanked low-contrast
dition, the target-high flankers-low condition, and the both-low condition could all be due to
cadic suppression.
ccadic suppression were the only factor here, we should have obtained decreasing performance
h TSO in all conditions where the target had low contrast (the unflanked low and the both low
ditions). Since saccadic suppression does not affect high-contrast stimuli as much as it affects low-
trast stimuli, one would expect no (or smaller) change in performance in the unflanked high
dition and the both high condition. However, if the low contrast flankers were suppressed,
formance should have increased, rather than decreased as the data show, with TSO in the target-
flankers-low condition. Since suppression of the target and flankers in the both-low condition
ates opposing effects, one would not be so sure about the net result, so making predictions for the
h-low condition from saccadic-suppression-only perspective is no more than a guess work.
us review our results again. We found that performance decreased with TSO not only in the
anked-low and the both-low conditions but also in the target-high flankers-low condition. Therefore,
results clearly rejects the claim that saccadic suppression might be the only factor. Since
formance decreased with TSO when the flankers had low contrast, regardless of the target’s
trast, an explanation based on compression of flankers toward the target seems more feasible. We
acknowledge that this is only an interpretation, and not a direct evidence. However, considering the
soning outlined above and the robust findings in the literature regarding perisaccadic compressions,
think that this scenario is quite possible.
ssuming that the two largest target-flanker spacings in Harrison et al.’s study can be used as a
per control (being the closest condition to the unflanked case, as the reviewer suggested),
formance did not improve with TSO in Harrison et al.’s study as well. In fact, at the largest
aration, performance in the saccade condition shows a decreasing trend with TSO (see their Figure
Similarly, we did not find any pre-saccadic improvement in performance in the unflanked conditions.
ough not addressed in Harrison et al. [1], the lack of improved performance in the aforementioned
ditions in both studies is worth noting. We are glad that Dr. Harrison is aware of the fact that almost
revious work on pre-saccadic improvements in recognition or detection, forward or backward masks
e involved. Li, Barbot, and Carrasco [2] did find pre-saccadic improvements in performance but (i)
y used a simple detection task, and (ii) the target stimulus was embedded in random noise so that
ntation and spatial frequency tuning can be estimated using reverse-correlation. Since detection and
rimination (or recognition) are not the same (e.g., crowding impairs discrimination but not
ection), this finding is difficult to generalize to pre-saccadic discrimination. More importantly, as Dr.
rison acknowledged, there is not much knowledge in the literature regarding pre-saccadic
rimination without masks, and the effects of certain stimulus choices (Gabors, letters) and
ameters (size, eccentricity, contrast) have not been fully characterized. Therefore, it is difficult to
ke solid conclusions about the lack of pre-saccadic improvements described above.
Second, I suggested that crowding is more appropriately defined as a change in performance
with target-flanker distance, and it is possible the submitted study may have uncovered other
changes in crowding had they measured more target-flanker separations. The authors have
provided an informative summary of the parameters used across previous studies – I encourage
them to present this in tabular format because it provides a fantastic summary.
included in our revised manuscript a new table which summarized the parameters in different
dies (see Line 783).
Due to the correspondence between the configural choices in the present study and our and
others’ experiment, the authors state that small differences across study designs are “unlikely to
be the cause of the disagreement of results” (line 566). It is not the small differences I was
concerned about, but the one-shot characterisation of crowding. It is well understood that the
extent of crowding can vary greatly from person to person (Petrov & Meleshkevich, 2011; Toet &
Levi, 1992), and so there’s not a clear reason to expect highly similar performance across studies
even if stimulus parameters were perfectly equated with previous studies. It remains an open
empirical question as to whether improvements in crowded performance would have occurred
for other target-flanker separations. I think this point needs to be acknowledged.
he previous review cycle, Dr. Harrison did inquire about the eccentricity difference between studies,
one of the anonymous reviewers mentioned that adding a vertical jitter to the target position across
ls or measuring and updating the threshold tilt values across visits might be the factors for the
ence of pre-saccadic uncrowding in our study. That’s why we included a detailed comparison of
dies in our revised manuscript.
also interesting to note that Dr. Harrison referred to the large individual differences in the crowding
ature, yet he opted to compute performance and critical spacing based on data pooled across all
ervers in his work.
The new paragraph in the Introduction provides what I think is much needed context for this
study. However, the authors cite van Koningsbruggen and Buonocore’s commentary on our
earlier paper, but yet they don’t reference our reply to their commentary. In our reply (Harrison,
Mattingley, & Remington, 2013a), we highlight a number of points regarding the design and
results of our study that van Koningsbruggen and Buonocore seem to have overlooked, and
similar problems of logic remain in the present revised manuscript. Most importantly, our
original results showed an interaction between target-flanker spacing and eye movement, and
so pre-saccade “attention”, whatever that means, cannot account for our data (by the same
logic, nor can unmasking). I also do not think it’s appropriate to cite the conference abstract in
reference 37, which I know has many problems with its design and conclusions.
included citations to all relevant work of Dr. Harrison and others to the best of our knowledge in the
sed manuscript (see Line 71 in the revised manuscript). Although Dr. Harrison did not specify what
limitations of Melcher and colleagues’ study are, we removed the citation per his request.
This result – that eye movement preparation affected performance differently across target-
flanker spacings – is critical. This finding largely addresses one of the main criticisms in the
present manuscript: that a “proper baseline” needs to be measured (line 402). Although we did
not measure unflanked performance during eye movement preparation, we did measure
crowded performance with very distant flankers and found no change in performance. This result
seems to be ignored by the authors, but it largely contradicts their speculations about the cause
of our results (see also Harrison et al 2013a). On lines 64 – 66 they state that we could not
conclude anything about crowding strength; but we can conclude that the area over which
crowding occurs changes, which to me seems analogous. I suggest the authors consider whether
a more appropriate baseline is pre-saccadic unflanked performance or pre-saccadic crowding
across target-flanker spacings (or both). This problem needs to be addressed in the manuscript.
It is disappointing the authors have also ignored this critical finding in their recent paper
(Agaoglu, Ögmen, & Chung, 2016). (This prior work also incorrectly states that unmasking can
explain a finding in our other paper (Harrison, Retell, Remington, & Mattingley, 2013b), in which
we actually found a worsening of performance – the authors seem confused about what we
found across different studies.)
(It seems something quite different from simple unmasking or “pre-saccadic attention” caused
our original finding. To play devil’s advocate, if our result does not show a genuine reduction in
crowding due to the eye movement per se, there must be at least an interaction with our
stimulus choices and the crowding zone – a simple main effect of masking, attention, whatever,
cannot explain what we found. In reference to line 563, the authors may also find it useful to
know that, after performing the permutation analyses we showed in our main Figure 3, I
compared performance for the no-saccade and the final time bin with a t-test, which came out
significant for all three smallest target-flanker spacings. However, I opted to report only the
more conservative permutation analyses to be more cautious.)
ortunately, Dr. Harrison seems to be confused about which paper of ours to evaluate for publication
SOS. In addition, his claim that our previous work claimed that “remapped crowding” is due to
asking, is not true. We are well aware of the differences between the two phenomena, and in fact,
ur work referenced by Dr. Harrison [3], we used a “remapping” stage or process which improves
formance, rather than impairs, in our modeling attempts.
well known in the crowding literature that the strength and extent of crowding refer to different
racteristics of a crowding function, and these two characteristics do not have to correlate with one
ther [4]. Crowding strength refers to the magnitude of the effect; whereas crowding extent refers to
spatial extent over which you have some crowding effect. In a sense, one can think of the crowding
e as an island – the height at any location represents the crowding strength and the perimeter of the
nd represents the crowding extent. Therefore, we are afraid that Dr. Harrison’s comment that “they
e that we could not conclude anything about crowding strength; but we can conclude that the area
r which crowding occurs changes, which to me seems analogous” is not correct, because the strength
rowding does not predict the area over which crowding occurs, so the two measurements are not
logous.
agree that the largest target-flanker spacing in Dr. Harrison’s work can be used as a rough estimate
aseline performance. However, due to the specific spatial arrangement of the target and flankers,
senting a target in isolation may not be similar to presenting it with flankers far away. To be more
cific, increasing the spacing will bring one of the radially presented flankers closer and closer to the
ea. Presenting a stimulus close to fovea may grab observer’s attention to this flanker. It has been
wn that the time it takes to deploy covert attention is strongly modulated by the presence of a visual
et at or near the fovea (e.g., ”the gap paradigm”, [5]). Therefore, a large target-flanker spacing and
absence of flankers may not have identical consequences on performance.
a side note, the performance in the largest target-flanker spacing in Harrison et al. (2013) was ~0.70
oth the saccade and fixation conditions. Since the tilt of the target Gabor was adjusted for each
erver to reach 75% correct performance, there is still a weak crowding effect even at the largest
cing. This is especially important for psychometric function fitting since in general, performance in
unflanked condition drives the lapse rate component of a psychometric function (or the asymptote
formance) and it can drastically change the critical spacing estimates. In addition, in Harrison et al.
13), the method of estimation of critical spacing (i.e., crowding zone) seems rather arbitrary. An
onential function in the form of <U+0001D45D><U+0001D450> = <U+0001D44E>(1 - <U+0001D452> (-<U+0001D460>(<U+0001D451>-<U+0001D456>)) ), where <U+0001D45D><U+0001D450> is proportion correct, <U+0001D44E> is the
mptote, <U+0001D460> is the scaling factor, <U+0001D451> is the spacing, and <U+0001D456> is the x-intercept, was used by Dr. Harrison and
eagues to fit performance as a function of spacing. However, this function does not have a lower
nd and violates the theoretical lower limit in performance in a 2AFC task (i.e., 0.5). We extracted the
a from Figure 3 in Harrison et al. (2013) with a data scraper (WebPlotDigitizer v3.1) and fit the
ction given above as well as a more standard psychometric function (a Weibull function with three
parameters). Figure R1 shows the data as well as fits by using the two methods.
re R1. Psychometric function fits to the data from Harrison et al. (2013). The solid lines represent
method used by Harrison and colleagues whereas the dotted lines represent the standard
chometric function fits. The vertical lines represent the critical spacings based on 90% of the

re R2 shows the critical spacings computed using both methods for all experimental conditions.
e that there are big differences in critical spacing estimates across different methods of fitting. The
cal spacings for the no saccade condition and the 100-149 ms condition are similar in both cases,
ever, they are substantially smaller when we compute them using a standard psychometric function
ng technique. Also note the drastic increase in critical spacing in the 50-99 ms time bin before
cades. This non-monotonic change in critical spacing with TSO is quite interesting, but it is not clear if
same trends will be obtained when these analyses are repeated on individual observer data,
sidering the large individual differences in crowding zones reported in the literature.
re R2. Critical spacing as a function of time-to-saccade onset (TSO). Different colors represent
erent methods of psychometric function fitting.
e that performance in the 50-99 ms and 0-49 ms conditions is very close (differences are less than
2), but due to the 0.018 difference in performance between the two conditions at the largest target-
ker spacing, the estimated critical spacing for the 50-99 ms condition is almost twice as big as that for
0-49 ms condition (or almost thrice as big if computed with a standard psychometric function fitting
hod, i.e., dotted lines in Figure R1). The fact that performance at the largest spacing for the 100-149
and 50-99 ms conditions are roughly 0.02 larger than corresponding fixation performance whereas the
formance in the 0-49 ms condition is almost identical (<0.01) suggests that the reported shrinkage of
wding zones might not be a robust finding. In fact, to demonstrate this, we re-fitted a psychometric
ction to the performance in the 0-49 ms condition with a 0.02 larger performance at the largest target-
ker spacing. Figure R3 shows the results. As can be seen, critical spacings in the no saccade and saccade
ditions are virtually identical.

Lines 523 – 525: I had to work hard to understand out how floor effects may be a culprit. If I
understand correctly, the authors are referring to the fact that crowding strength appears to
diminish in the target-low flankers-high condition because unflanked performance worsened,
whereas flanked performance remained the same. I think this is worth being explicit about.
e. Lines 522-525.
For my review I’m also asked to comment on the accessibility of the supporting data. I tried the
link offered by the authors, but it doesn’t seem to lead to anything.
ording to the Dryad policy, there is an embargo on the data until the corresponding paper is
lished. Thus, the same link (http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.r9g5c) will start working as soon as our
nuscript is published. However, for pre-publication access, the reviewers can use the following link.
://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.r9g5c
Finally, one small request: I would very much appreciate it if the authors could indicate where in
the revised manuscript changes have been made to facilitate tracking their attempts to clarify
issues.

Anonymous Reviewer:
My main issue with the initial submission was that the focus of the manuscript was not entirely
clear. The authors have now taken steps to improve this, and the specific contribution of the
manuscript to our understanding of crowding and the link with saccadic eye movements is now
much more clear. However, not all of the alterations to the manuscript are improvements, in my
opinion.
The discussion in particular is now exceedingly long, with extremely detailed descriptions of prior
studies that have investigated crowding and saccades. Four prior studies are given several
paragraphs each, beginning in each case with tedious amounts of detail to describe the studies
(stimulus sizes, eccentricity values, presentation times, etc.) which in most cases are never
referred to again. In cases where these parameters are deemed relevant to the discussion, they
are re-stated subsequently in any case (e.g. with eccentricity values). I suggest the discussion
needs to be cut back substantially, leaving only the details that are pertinent to the discussion.
The level of detail used to describe the authors previous work (Agaoglu et al 2016) is
appropriate, and I would take this as a guide. If the authors really wish to have this comparison
of parameters laid out, then a simple table of these values would surely suffice, rather than
filling the text with needless detail. Otherwise it once more obscures the focus of the paper.
have shortened the Discussion section and added a new table to the revised manuscript.
Minor issues
-p2 line 28 – photoreceptors are described as having larger receptive fields in peripheral vision.
My understanding is that photoreceptors do not vary in receptive field size and that this is only
evident in subsequent levels from retinal ganglion cells onwards. A reference is needed here in
any case.
did not mean to suggest that photoreceptors have larger receptive fields in the periphery. We have
sed that sentence to clarify the meaning, and we added a reference in the revised manuscript (Lines
29).
-A range of grammatical errors still remain:
-p11 line 316 should be ‘statistically identical’.
-There are still instances of the word ‘performances’ (lines 333 and 336) – in the context of data,
performance is an uncountable noun. Performances are concerts.
-p19 line 552 should be “the closest separations” and p19 line 554 “of the fraction”.
