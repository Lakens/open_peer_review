This paper deals with the problem of arc fault detection in low voltage electrical circuits. It
proposes 3 indicators and shows how to process the measured signals to compute the indicators
and present a data fusion algorithm based on the use of support vector machines to provide a
detection information.
The paper is written in good english (as far as I can tell, I'm not a native english speaker),
although there are some mistakes or ambiguities in the vocabulary used which make some parts
difficult to understand. The paper should be proof-read by a fluent english speaker.
The introduction is too short and does not describe the problem of varying loads or circuit
impedances which prevent from efficient arc detection. It doesn't explain why the authors have
investigated new methods nor how the chose these methods. Someone who is not expert in this
field may not understand this choice nor know if it is the best choice of detection methods.
The 3 indicators are presented (high frequency feature extraction, current slope signal
measurement, periodic integral characteristics extraction) in 3 separate chapters.
The last sentence of the chapter describing the first method is hard to understand: " Using the
high frequency pulse as a criterion therefore __invites signal loss__". Do the authors mean
"implies"?
The second indicator is quite efficient at detecting arc-fault mode, and recognize them from
normal operation or on-switching of loads. As shown in this chapter, this indicator can be used
alone for arc fault detection.
The third indicator is shown to be efficient at detecting the change between normal mode and arc
fault mode.
I don't understand why the authors do not simply use only one of them (such as slope
measurement). There is no real comparison of the output of the 3 methods on the same dataset.
The introductory sentence of section 3 says that the 3 methods "indicate arc faults in __different
circumstances__" but this is not clearly shown in the preceding chapters. The reader cannot easily
compare the performances of the 3 methods if they are not used in the same conditions.
Section 3 presents the application of support vector machines (SVM) to the fusion of the results of
the 3 methods. It is quite complex to understand, as the equations use symbols which are not
defined or explained in the text. The results are interesting: tables 1 and 2 show that the fusion of
the 3 methods can efficiently recognize an ar fult from normal operation and load start-up. But
these table do not show the results from each method in all the test cases, to justify the need for
the data fusion algorithm. The reader cannot see from these tables if (for example) method
number 2 alone would have detected the arc faults.
I recommend that the paper requires major revision before publication:
- improve the introduction and state of the art description, showing why new methods are
required,
- proof read the paper by a fluent english speaker
- explain the choice of indicators. A signal due to an arc fault is quite chaotic, irregular or random.
This means that any processing method aiming at finding regularities in a signal can be used as
an indicator (showing no regularitiy thus detecting an arc fault). Why choosing these particular
3
methods and not others such as moving average, short time Fourier transform, autocorrelation,
etc. ?
- compare more deeply the 3 methods, in the same conditions, to show their advantages and
drawbacks and help the reader understand why it is necessary to use data fusion on the 3 results
- in the table of results, add the results of each signle method to better justify the need for the
fusion algorithm
- verify the equations (sometimes capital letters in the text reference small letters used in
equations, N is not defined for eqn 4, etc)

label_comment_2
Arc fault is the main potential of electrical fire. A novel detection method was proposed and
tested in low-voltage electrical circuits in this paper. In its technical content, the research carried
out and results are of good quality. I believe it could be accepted after the following revisions are
accomplished.
1) The authors should give more details about the power supply of experiments, such as
frequency. Why the power supply in Fig. 2(b) is different from that in Fig. 2(a)?
2) Current-period integral-characteristic is one of the three arc fault features in this paper.
Periodic integral time of each cycle is an important parameter, and the specific value should be
added.
3) Arc fault, arc in a branch and trunk arc are mentioned many times in this paper, especially in
Tabs. 1 & 2, what are differences among them?
4) Page 16 lines 3 “current-cycle eigenvalues from arc-fault currents”. Current-cycle eigenvalues
have several types. The authors should point out the specific characteristics.
Other comments are:
i) To better describe arc faults, “indicator” in this paper may be replaced with “characteristics”,
such as page 2-14“…provides another indicator”, page 2-16 “These three indicators…”, page 8-10
“other indicators are…”. Please check.
4
ii) Page 4-48 “A 100-m long copper wire…” may be replaced with “A 100 m long copper wire…”.
iii) The authors should pay attention to the use of the singular and the plural, such as page 7-29
“…results for series arc fault”, page 7-55 “…results of parallel arc fault”. The “fault” may be used
as the plural.
iv) All abbreviations in this paper should use a unified form,such as Page 16-45 “JH. Y. and HY.
F contributed…” may be replaced with “JH. Y. and HY. F. contributed…”.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The authors present an arc-fault diagnosis algorithm based on the use of multiple criteria and
support vector machine approach.
The topic is very important and interesting. However, the presented work is flawed in several
ways. The paper is not well organized. It is very difficult to distinguish the experimental part
from the part where the method should be presented. The methods section starts with the
experimental scheme where the experimental bench used to generate the results exploited in the
work is presented. Then, the high frequency feature extraction scheme is presented. This part is
concluded with the three indicators chosen for arc fault detection. Then in the results section the
authors present the method used to exploit these before mention criteria. The whole paper is
organized in that awkward way. The reader finds all information scattered all over the paper
which makes the reading and evaluation of the paper very difficult. Some parts of the results
section should be moved to the methods section.
The authors mention briefly in the introduction part the main methods used for arc fault
detection, without further explanation. The references are outdated and should be updated.
The criteria introduced by authors are not at all justified. More explanations should be provided
5
for all introduced criteria and a comparison
with the state-of-the-art methods criteria.
When the authors say that the parameters beta, C and T were optimized, what were the criteria of
optimization used for this optimization?
If other loads (not mentioned in Table 2) are tested, does the whole system needs to be trained
again? Will the similar results be obtained?
In the results section, there is no comparison with the state-of-the-art works on the same topic.

I think the quality of the current version of the paper has increased. I believe it can be published if
some minor revisions are done :
- explain the meaning of GB14287.4-2014 and how it impacts the simulation platform
- change the capital Xs to lowercase x in equation (1)
- add one worldwide recognized reference about SVM
- explain briefly the matrix analysis algorithm used in the multi information fusion box (chapter

This version of the paper is greatly improved in comparison with the initial one.
However, I have some remarks that should be corrected for the final version.
There are still some typos in the paper: flourier -> fourier
Slavisa Jovanovic present -> Jovanovic et al. present
In the sentence "The method's reference current is used as the starting point four our method
tested on a large variety of loads:" our is for the authors' method or for the method presented in
this paper?
What does it mean "the load are complicated and dynamic"?
The end of the introduction part should be improved. I think that a new paragraph should start
from "Therefore, there is some limitation in the identification ..." and a better transition to what is
presented in this paper.
In the methods part, it is a bit confusing the use of both HFRC signals or High-frequency
coupling signals. Try to use only one notation.
In section 2.2.2 data points x1 to xm are sometimes in capital letters, and sometimes in small
letters. Try to use the same style throughout the paper.
In section 2.2.3, there is a problem with sentence "Considering that some of the loads are in
normal operation in a faults circuit, ..."
In equation (6), there is inner product between xi and x. What is x? Is there an index missing?
For the same equation "where alpha Lagrangian multiplier" "is" is missing.
In section 2.3.3, how the value of C=100 is chosen?
There is a problem with a sentence at the line 43 of the page 15.
Page 16, line 33: The HFRC, CWSC, ... is -> are
Page 16, line 41: Stable operation -> stable operation
Page 16, line 42: Start-up of load is easily considered "as" arc faults by CWPIC.
Page 17, line 2: There is a problem with the first sentence of the first paragraph.

I think the quality of the current version of the paper has increased. I believe it can be published if
some minor revisions are done :
- explain the meaning of GB14287.4-2014 and how it impacts the simulation platform
- change the capital Xs to lowercase x in equation (1)
- add one worldwide recognized reference about SVM
- explain briefly the matrix analysis algorithm used in the multi information fusion box (chapter
2.3.3)
Table 1 and 2 greatly help compare the 3 methods and understand their complementarity.
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
This version of the paper is greatly improved in comparison with the initial one.
However, I have some remarks that should be corrected for the final version.
There are still some typos in the paper: flourier -> fourier
Slavisa Jovanovic present -> Jovanovic et al. present
In the sentence "The method's reference current is used as the starting point four our method
tested on a large variety of loads:" our is for the authors' method or for the method presented in
this paper?
What does it mean "the load are complicated and dynamic"?
The end of the introduction part should be improved. I think that a new paragraph should start
from "Therefore, there is some limitation in the identification ..." and a better transition to what is
presented in this paper.
15
In the methods part, it is a bit confusing the use of both HFRC signals or High-frequency
coupling signals. Try to use only one notation.
In section 2.2.2 data points x1 to xm are sometimes in capital letters, and sometimes in small
letters. Try to use the same style throughout the paper.
In section 2.2.3, there is a problem with sentence "Considering that some of the loads are in
normal operation in a faults circuit, ..."
In equation (6), there is inner product between xi and x. What is x? Is there an index missing?
For the same equation "where alpha Lagrangian multiplier" "is" is missing.
In section 2.3.3, how the value of C=100 is chosen?
There is a problem with a sentence at the line 43 of the page 15.
Page 16, line 33: The HFRC, CWSC, ... is -> are
Page 16, line 41: Stable operation -> stable operation
Page 16, line 42: Start-up of load is easily considered "as" arc faults by CWPIC.
Page 17, line 2: There is a problem with the first sentence of the first paragraph.

Dear editor,
Thank you for your letter accepting the manuscript entitled An Arc Fault
Diagnosis Algorithm using Multi-information Fusion and Support Vector
Machines.
We have made all the changes you suggested in your letter and address all
the comments of the reviewers in the note below. Please note that comments are
shown in plain type and our responses in bold type.
Respond to comments by Reviewer: 1
- improve the introduction and state of the art description, showing why new
methods are required,
The introduction had been revised. The third sections are added to the
introduction. The shortcomings of single feature recognition arc faults are
mainly introduced. Please see line 18-28 in page 3.
- proof read the paper by a fluent english speaker
I'm very sorry that the poor English writing influenced your review. English
writing has been corrected by a fluent English speaker, The author did his
best to modify the English writing of the paper. but I am not sure whether to
meet the requirements.
- explain the choice of indicators. A signal due to an arc fault is quite chaotic,
irregular or random. This means that any processing method aiming at finding
regularities in a signal can be used as an indicator (showing no regularitiy thus
detecting an arc fault). Why choosing these particular methods and not others
such as moving average, short time Fourier transform, autocorrelation, etc. ?
Through short-time Fourier transform, we also made arc faults detection in
the early stage. This method is effective when the characteristics of zero
crossing are obvious, but the characteristics of some zero crossing points are
not obvious. In the previous arc fault detection experiment, the three arc
fault features are found to be changed for different loads and working
conditions. Only one characteristic is not suitable for all working conditions
and loads. Multi-information fusion can improve the accuracy of
recognition. The characteristics of each criterion are introduced, and the
necessity of multi information fusion criterion is also verified in detail.
Please see line 15-28 in page 3, Table.1 and Table.2.
- compare more deeply the 3 methods, in the same conditions, to show their
advantages and drawbacks and help the reader understand why it is necessary to
use data fusion on the 3 results
- in the table of results, add the results of each signle method to better justify the
need for the fusion algorithm
We calculate the results of the arc fault identification for each single feature.
These results are compared with the recognition results of the
multi-information fusion algorithm. The results are compared to table.1 and
table.2.
- verify the equations (sometimes capital letters in the text reference small letters
used in equations, N is not defined for eqn 4, etc)
The equation 4 had been revised. N was defined, and all the formulas were
checked and modified. For example, formula 1
Respond to comments by Reviewer: 2
1) The authors should give more details about the power supply of experiments,
such as frequency. Why the power supply in Fig. 2(b) is different from that in
Fig. 2(a)?
Reply 1): The power supply of all experiments is 220V AC (50Hz). The
power supply in Fig. 2(b) is 220V AC as well as in Fig. 2(a). The 220V DC in
Fig. 2(b) is an editing error.
2) Current-period integral-characteristic is one of the three arc fault features in
this paper. Periodic integral time of each cycle is an important parameter, and the
specific value should be added.
Reply 2): The current-cycle is 20ms. We have added the specific value in
this paper.
3) Arc fault, arc in a branch and trunk arc are mentioned many times in this paper,
especially in Tabs. 1 & 2, what are differences among them?
Reply 3): Arc in a branch and trunk arc are both arc faults in this paper,
they are used to describe different kinds of arc faults. The accurate
expression of “arc in a branch and trunk arc” is “arc fault in a branch and
trunk arc fault”. We have modified corresponding places in this paper.
4) Page 16 lines 3 “current-cycle eigenvalues from arc-fault currents”.
Current-cycle eigenvalues have several types. The authors should point out the
specific characteristics.
Reply 4): Current-cycle eigenvalues indicate current cycle integral
characteristics. We have modified in this paper.
Other comments are:
i) To better describe arc faults, “indicator” in this paper may be replaced with
“characteristics”, such as page 2-14“…provides another indicator”,
page 2-16 “These three indicators…”, page 8-10 “other indicators are…”. Please
check.
Reply i): “Indicator” in this paper has been replaced with “characteristics”
in this paper.
ii) Page 4-48 “A 100-m long copper wire…” may be replaced with “A 100 m
long copper wire…”.
Reply ii): We have modified in this paper.
iii) The authors should pay attention to the use of the singular and the plural,
such as page 7-29 “…results for series arc fault”, page 7-55 “…results of parallel
arc fault”. The “fault” may be used as the plural.
Reply iii): The “fault” mentioned above should be used as the plural. We
have rechecked the use of the singular and the plural in this paper.
iv) All abbreviations in this paper should use a unified form,such as Page 16-45
“JH. Y. and HY. F contributed…” may be replaced with “JH. Y. and HY. F.
contributed…”.
Reply iv): “JH. Y. and HY. F. contributed…” is right. We have modified in
this paper.
Respond to comments by Reviewer: 3
The topic is very important and interesting. However, the presented work is
flawed in several ways. The paper is not well organized. It is very difficult to
distinguish the experimental part
from the part where the method should be presented. The methods section starts
with the experimental scheme where the experimental bench used to generate the
results exploited in the work is presented. Then, the high frequency feature
extraction scheme is presented. This part is concluded with the three indicators
chosen for arc fault detection. Then in the results section the authors present the
method used to exploit these before mention criteria. The whole paper is
organized in that awkward way. The reader finds all information scattered all
over the paper which makes the reading and evaluation of the paper very difficult.
Some parts of the results section should be moved to the methods section.
This is a very good suggestion. The paper is not well organized. I'm sorry to
have spent a lot of your time review this paper. We had changed the
structure of the paper. For the old papers, the arc fault feature extraction
results in the second section were moved to the third section. The support
vector machine and the multi information fusion algorithm in the third
quarter are moved to the second quarter. So, the second section is about the
construction of experimental platform, experimental scheme and data
processing method. The third section is mainly about the results of arc fault
feature extraction and the results of arc fault recognition. Please see the
second and third section in the revised paper.
The authors mention briefly in the introduction part the main methods used for
arc fault detection, without further explanation. The references are outdated and
should be updated.
The main methods used for arc fault detection had been further explained.
Please see line 17-20 in page 3 and line 1-12 in page 4. In the introduction,
Some new references have been added and some old references have been
removed. Please see reference 3-6 and reference 8-12. The existing low
voltage arc fault diagnosis algorithm is discussed.
The criteria introduced by authors are not at all justified. More explanations
should be provided for all introduced criteria and a comparison
with the state-of-the-art methods criteria.
An experimental platform for arc fault simulation is built, which simulates
series and parallel arc faults by point contact, metallic contact and
Carbonization path, and Some of the loads are selected by UL1699-2011 and
GB14287.4-2014. The criteria introduced were explained. Please see
line20-27 in page 4. But the method of identifying the arc wave is not
specified. The work of this paper focuses on the identification of arc
waveform. During the experiment, we ensured the arc generator to generate
multiple arc half waves by means of the distance adjustment device. Sure
arc faults can be produced.
When the authors say that the parameters beta, C and T were optimized, what
were the criteria of optimization used for this optimization?
Thank you very much for pointing out this mistake. The C is a penalty
factor that represents tolerance for recognition errors, C is a constant, not
an optimized variable. On the optimization criteria and steps of beta and T,
please see line 4-9 in page 11.
If other loads (not mentioned in Table 2) are tested, does the whole system needs
to be trained again? Will the similar results be obtained?
We tested the load according to the standard. Testing more different loads
will help to make the recognition model more accurate. If the resistance and
inductance characteristics of the load are very peculiar, the recognition
model needs to be trained and optimized again.
In the results section, there is no comparison with the state-of-the-art works on
the same topic.
We compare the results of various single feature recognition arc faults with
the results of multi information fusion recognition. The results are shown in
Table.1 and table.2. And the results of each recognition are further
explained. Please see section 3 in the paper.
