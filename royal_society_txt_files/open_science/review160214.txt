The author uses a movement model to study whether a minimal level of memorization, which
lacks ability to determine spatial location, enables a forager to exhibit home range behavior,
including the curve of its frequency of site visitations showing a long tail. The forager can only
remember the number of sites that were in its perceptual field at previous times, and that
memory is erased after a certain number of time steps. In the proposed model, the forager has the
ability to use two alternative movement rules, which it can switch between.
I have a few comments:
The hypothesis that animals can store some memories of details of specific places that it has
visited, but do not have spatial memory in the sense of being able to find a particular places on
the landscape, is an interesting one, and there seems to be empirical evidence for that idea. For
example, Niko Tinbergen’s experiments with digger wasps show that they can recognize the
pattern of surrounding stones (or other objects) around one of their nests, but can be tricked if
those stones are moved. Therefore, the idea of local ‘snapshot’ memory is reasonable. In the
present author’s case, the animal is foraging, not trying to find a nest. The stored memory has the
purpose of stimulating the foraging animal to switch to another movement pattern to increase the
total area that is searches.
The captions on Figure 2 are not detailed enough and it is hard to be sure that I understood the
figures. In particular;
Concerning Figure 2a. Does the histogram represent the results of each of 100 trials? For example,
does the frequency ’15’ mean that in 15 of the trials between the number of visited sites was
between 6 and 8 (it’s hard to make out exact numbers along the x-axis). Instead of ‘N of visited
sites’, why not just say ‘number of visited sites’. (The author uses ‘N of data’ in line 131. Does N
also mean ‘number’ there?”)
Concerning Figure 2b. Does this plot mean that a few sites were visited thousands of times in this
trial? Is the cumulative number of sites visited in this trial (the point where the curve meets the y-
axis) somewhat greater than 10, say about 20? The captions need to be greatly improved to state
in more detail exactly what the figures mean.
Some of the text is also confusing. For example, in line 203, where the text is ‘recognizing each
site (habitat)’, I interpret that to mean having a complete knowledge of space; that is, the forager’s
being able to find its way to a particular location by memory.
Lines 128-129. The author states that ‘it seems that the agent visits approximately dozens of sites
in each trial’. That is a slight exaggeration. In the great majority of trials the number of sites
visited in less than 20.
Lines 151. The author states that an advantage of the rule-change model is that it creates a
‘power-law tailed distribution’. This leads to a ‘weak home-range property’ with some
exploration of new sites. On the other hand, the ‘random search’ covers many more new sites that
the rule-change model. It is not really explained why a ‘weak home-range property’ is a better
strategy for a forager than visiting more sites – which should expose the forager to more
3
resources. If there is an advantage of there being some advantage to a home range, then there
should probably be some maximum home range that the forager remains within. What properties
does the rule-change model have of keeping the forager from sometimes straying too far? Is the
rule-change model always reliable in causing the animal to return to a certain area.
Line 208. Does ‘recover’ mean for a site to recover its resources?
Overall, the author’s proposed model is a plausible one and the simulation analysis leads to
interesting and unexpected results (e.g., that the rule-change model is so much better than the
fixed exploitation and fixed exploration models). My main criticism is that the author needs to
work harder in certain places to make sure that the explanation of results is clearer.
Minor problems:
Line 39. Change ‘of actual living’ to ‘living’
Line 43. Change “agent’s” to “an agent’s”
Line 208. Insects are animals. Change to ‘recover b because insects and larger animals …’

The revision is improved in terms of defining the goal of the model, and clarifying how the
model works with pseudo code. However, the contribution of the model to the literature remains
ambiguous. The authors write: "The goal of this study is to investigate whether such a low-
capacity agent can somewhat exhibit a weak home range during foraging and demonstrate the
balance between exploitation (a home range) and exploration (visiting to new sites) relating to
movement strategy." I think the model provides evidence in favor of this goal, but how does this
advance our understanding of foraging?
One way to answer my question is to show that the current model is better than other models in
some regards, or optimizes / maximizes some desirable metric. I asked about this in my first
4
review, and the authors did not provide an adequate response in my opinion. I still don't know if
other models would behave similarly (some with similar or less memory capacity), and there is
no evidence that the model does not optimize or maximize anything. Another way to answer my
question would be to compare the model with empirical data and show that it provides a new or
better explanation than previous models. However, the model was not directly compared with
empirical data.
In the end, I concluded that the model does exhibit a "weak" home range behavior, but I was not
convinced that this conclusion is a sufficient contribution to warrant publication.

Dear Editor,
Thank you for considering our manuscript in Journal of the Royal Society Open Science. We have
rewritten our manuscript according to the Editors/Reviewers comments and have responded to these
comments correspondingly.
We expect that this revision will be satisfactory to their expectations.
Yours sincerely,
Tomoko Sakiyama
Response to Reviewers/Editors,
First of all, we found a mistake in respect to our algorithm descriptions. In original
manuscript, we had written that “If the total number of local sites of the current position is
equal to the agent’s memorized value (memory_sum), the agent replaces the current rule
with the other rule”. (Line 98-99). We replaced above sentences with “f the total number of
local sites of the current position is equal to the agent’s memorized value (memory_sum),
the agent replaces the current rule with the other rule with probability 0.5.” We also changed
related figures and algorithm codes.
We will never ever let this happen again.

Response:
We added following sentences to Figure 2a captions.
“For example, the frequency ’15’ mean that in 15 of the trials between the number of visited
sites was between 6 and 8.
We also replaced “N of visited sites” with “the number of visited sites”.

Response:
We added following sentences to figure captions.
“A few sites were visited thousands of times in this trial. Contrary to that, the point where the
curve meets the y-axis means the number of sites visited a few times.”
We also replaced “recognizing each site (habitat)” with “detecting each food site”.
> Lines 128-129. The author states that ‘it seems that the agent visits approximately dozens
of sites in each trial’. That is a slight exaggeration. In the great majority of trials the number
of sites visited in less than 20.

from sometimes straying too far? Is the rule-change model always reliable in causing the
animal to return to a certain area.
Response:
We rewrote discussion sections line 216-219 as following.
“Getting pinned between several sites (exploitation) is effective for foraging because
animals might visit a few sites reliably in a small region by returning to a certain area.
However in the long term, causing the animal to slowly wonder around the whole terrain
(exploration) and removing home-ranging behavior are important to discover more profitable
or new food locations. Thus, the balance between exploitation and exploration is exhibited
as a weak home-range”.
> Line 208. Does ‘recover’ mean for a site to recover its resources?
Response:
Recover means for a site to recover its resources.
> Minor problems:
Line 39. Change ‘of actual living’ to ‘living’
Line 43. Change “agent’s” to “an agent’s”
Line 208. Insects are animals. Change to ‘recover b because insects and larger animals

Response:
We corrected above three problems according to reviewer’s suggestions.

We conducted additional analysis and compared some desirable metric using rule-change
model with memory-based foraging algorithms based on recent studies. We added
description of the spatial memory-based model to Materials & Methods and related analysis
to Results. We also added algorithm codes to supporting files.
