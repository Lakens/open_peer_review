1. Glad to read this manuscript which try to induce nerve injury by using capsaicin, and then
observe the effects on peri-implant osseointegration. The positive results confirmed this unique
hypothesis.
2. The methods and materials need to be refined further. There were one experiment group and
one control, why not add another group with capsaicin but without implant placement? Should
not this group add more proof to the conclusion?
3. The microCT scanning parts is not clear. What kind of energy filter was used for scanning this
high dense implant inside the bone tissue? And what is the basic imaging processing dealing
with metal artefacts and beam hardening?
4. The first image in the histological graph was a bit dark compared to other ones.
5. In the discussion part, “ One week later, the corresponding sensory neurons were compeletly
lost", No reference? no info about how to examine<U+3002>
6. In the discussion part, ”Neurotrophin such as NGF
secreted by the local bone could induce the reinnervation of other lower extremity sensory
neurons, so the trabecular number and the positive fibers of CGRP-IR of the sensory-denervated
group were increased at six weeks compared to three weeks after implantation. Although
Neurotrophin increased at six weeks, the trabecular number and the positive fibers of CGRP-IR in
the sensory-denervated group still less than that in the sensory-intact group.“ positive fibers of
CGRP-IR was not clear in the previous results part.
7. ”Offley at al reported “ should be ” offley et al. reported".
8. "On the other hand, the Neurotrophin could promote angiogenesis, which would benefit
the reconstruction of bone around the implant [38,40]." is this a clear conclusion or just an
inference ?

Comments to the Author(s)

Please clarify the following questions:
1. There are flaws in language which needs further proofreading and correction.
2. The authors claim that one week after the injection of capsaicin, the sensory neurons were
completely destroyed, for which no tests were carried however. This is theoretically true only
when the procedure is properly done and thus a test of sensory function before the placement of
implants would be helpful to confirm the sensory denervation.
3. The grouping and time points of examinations were not clearly described. It was only stated in
line 6 of page 3 that there are 40 rats which were divided into two groups. The authors however
did several tests with the samples drawn from both femurs of all animals at two time points after
the surgery. It was not clarified how many samples from either group underwent each of the
examinations, and it is thus not possible to appreciate the correctness of statistics.

Comments to the Author(s)
1. Glad to read this manuscript which try to induce nerve injury by using capsaicin, and then
observe the effects on peri-implant osseointegration. The positive results confirmed this
unique hypothesis.
Answer: Yes, in this manuscript, we found capsaicin could injure the nerve, and then affect
the peri-implant osstoeintegration.
2. The methods and materials need to be refined further. There were one experiment group
and one control, why not add another group with capsaicin but without implant placement?
Should not this group add more proof to the conclusion?
Answer: Previous studies have showed that capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons play an
important role in bone modeling and it could result in the reduction of bone density and
mechanical properties. The trabecular bone volume was reduced by 40% and the ultimate
strength in decreased by 20.3%, in capsaicin group compared to control group, respectively.

Other studies also showed the same results. (Offley SC, Guo TZ, Wei T, Clark JD, Vogel

We think previous studies could prove the question that capsaicin could affect bone metabolism
without implant placement. So, in this study, we didn’t add this group.
And the same time, we have refined the methods and materials of this manuscript to make this
manuscript more reasonable.
3. The microCT scanning parts is not clear. What kind of energy filter was used for scanning
this high dense implant inside the bone tissue? And what is the basic imaging processing
dealing with metal artefacts and beam hardening?
Answer: The filter we used is CU 0.1mm, the energy/Intensity we used is 90 kVp, 200uA and
18w. The way we used to reduce artifacts is to increase the scan voltage to 90 kVp and
increase the integration time to 500ms.
4. The first image in the histological graph was a bit dark compared to other ones.
Answer: Yes, we have changed the first image in the histological graph to make it lighter and
similar to others.
5. In the discussion part, “ One week later, the corresponding sensory neurons were
compeletly lost", No reference? no info about how to examine<U+3002>
Answer: After we read other articles, we think that “One week later, the corresponding
sensory neurons were compeletly lost” is not rigorous. So, we think it would be scientific to
say” One week later, the capsaicin worked and the selective lesions in sensory fibers happened
[7,31]”. And the reference is 7 and 31.
6. In the discussion part, ”Neurotrophin such as NGF secreted by the local bone could induce
the reinnervation of other lower extremity sensory neurons, so the trabecular number and
the positive fibers of CGRP-IR of the sensory-denervated group were increased at six weeks
compared to three weeks after implantation. Although Neurotrophin increased at six weeks,
the trabecular number and the positive fibers of CGRP-IR in the sensory-denervated group
still less than that in the sensory-intact group.“ positive fibers of CGRP-IR was not clear in the
previous results part.
Answer: At first, we put the result of CGRP-IR (Abcam, USA) staining in the article. But, after
we discussed the manuscript, we deleted the result of CGRP-IR staining, and we didn’t find
we have discussed the CGRP-IR in the discussion. And now, we think we should put the result
of CGRP-IR staining in the supplements. And we have added this in the end of the manuscript.

7. ”Offley at al reported “ should be ” offley et al. reported".
Answer: Thank you for your kind suggestion. We have changed “Offley at al reported “ as ”
Offley et al. reported" in the third paragraph of discussion.
8. "On the other hand, the Neurotrophin could promote angiogenesis, which would benefit
the reconstruction of bone around the implant [38-40]." is this a clear conclusion or just an
inference ?
Answer: In Wang’s study, she found that a reduced angiogenesis alongside a decline in
bone-implant contact percentage and bone mass in a-CGRP -/- mice. Overexpression of aCGRP
could partly rescue the impairment. They aslo showed aCGRP increased vascular volume fraction
and mean vessel size, as well as spatially relocated vessels approximate to the region of bone
formation. And angiogenic and osteogenic genes were significantly upregulated in the
transfection and aCGRPþ/þ group.
So we infer that “the Neurotrophin could promote angiogenesis, which would benefit
the reconstruction of bone around the implant.”, and we think it is more reasonable to use
“might replace “would”.
And this sentence changed as” On the other hand, the Neurotrophin could promote
angiogenesis, which might benefit the reconstruction of bone around the implant [38-40].”

Comments to the Author(s)
Please clarify the following questions:
1. There are flaws in language which needs further proofreading and correction.
Answer: We are not native speakers of English, so it is a little hard for us to have a well
written in the first time. But we have re-edited the language one sentence by one sentence.
After that, we have invited the professionals (Recommended by Associate Editor) to modify
the language of the manuscript. Thank you for your suggestions.
2. The authors claim that one week after the injection of capsaicin, the sensory neurons were
completely destroyed, for which no tests were carried however. This is theoretically true only
when the procedure is properly done and thus a test of sensory function before the placement
of implants would be helpful to confirm the sensory denervation.
Answer: Many studies showed that the selective lesions in sensory fibers happened after the
injection of capsaicin in one week. And the reference is 7 and 31(Ding Y, Arai M, Kondo H, et al.
Effects of capsaicin-induced sensory denervation on bone metabolism in adult rats. Bone. 2010;
46: 1591-6. Zhang ZK, Guo X, Lao JQ, Lin YX. Effect of capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons
on bone architecture and mechanical properties in the rat hindlimb suspension model. J Orthop
Translat. 2017 Mar 27;10:12-17. doi: 10.1016/j.jot.2017.03.001. eCollection 2017 Jul.)
And we have added the CGRP-IR staining in the supplement 1 to state the problem.
3. The grouping and time points of examinations were not clearly described. It was only
stated in line 6 of page 3 that there are 40 rats which were divided into two groups. The
authors however did several tests with the samples drawn from both femurs of all animals at
two time points after the surgery. It was not clarified how many samples from either group
underwent each of the examinations, and it is thus not possible to appreciate the correctness
of statistics.
Answer: 40 rats were divided in two groups, 20 in each group. 80 implants were used, and one
implant was used in left leg and one in right leg for each rat (This information has added in 2.4
Implant surgery). 10 animals were killed at each time point in each group, and 4 parallel tests
were carried out for each test. And “N=4” has been added in illustration of each figure.

Thank you for your further work, which makes sense and contributes to the final paper!
Please note that it is better to use same term in one paper in stead of using many different
ones, eg. micro-CT, µCT, µ-CT, micro computed tomography.
Answer: I have use the same term in this paper. And I have changed “micro-CT, µCT, µ-CT,
micro computed tomography” to be “micro-CT” all through the paper.
