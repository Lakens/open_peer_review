General Comments: This is an interesting manuscript that compares visual estimates of white
sharks by three groups (scientists, crew and passengers) and compares with measurements taken
by stereo-camera system. The manuscript is well written and the results and discussion are
suitable. More information is required in the methods section regarding validity/accuracy of the
stereo-camera system (see below).
Specific Comments:
P5 – L22-55. Regarding accurate measuring of white sharks, it has been previously demonstrated
that using stereo-video is a suitable and accurate method however there is no mention of this.
There is no mention of other studies that have employed non-visual methods for estimating
white shark size, even though there are published studies that document direct measurements
rather than visual, there should be at least a sentence in the Intro discussing these other studies of
direct measurement. See for example: Harasti, D., Lee, KA., Laird, R., Bradford, R. and Bruce., B.
(2016). Use of baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs) to estimate relative abundance
and size of juvenile white sharks Carcharodon carcharias. Marine and Freshwater Research.
http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF16184.
P6 37-55: There needs to be much more information provide about the stereo-camera system used
3
in regards how were they calibrated, what were the calibration tests and what was the camera
accuracy. Below are some specific questions
How were the cameras calibrated? Was a calibration cube used?
How often was the camera calibration checked? Was it done just once or throughout the entire
study? Did the camera need to recalibrated at all?
Was a known length scale bar used to test calibration?
How do you know that the cameras were providing accurate estimates?
Provide error estimates for the calibration tests and provide some data summarising the
calibration tests. This will help demonstrate the accuracy of measurements from the stereo-
camera system.
Can you provide an estimate of the size of the field of view or detection range of the cameras?
How many measurements of each shark were used? Was an average measurement taken based
on different passes/angle/frames? Or just one single measurement taken? More info is required.

Response to reviewer’s comments
Reviewer 1
Interesting and needed paper. Good job! References Section needs some cleaning up. Some
incomplete, at least one has date listed at end instead of after authors.
Response: We thank the reviewer for their time reviewing the manuscript and complimentary
comments about our manuscript. The reference list has been corrected and completed.
Reviewer 2
1) P5 – L22-55. Regarding accurate measuring of white sharks, it has been previously
demonstrated that using stereo-video is a suitable and accurate method however there is no
mention of this. There is no mention of other studies that have employed non-visual methods
for estimating white shark size, even though there are published studies that document direct
measurements rather than visual, there should be at least a sentence in the Intro discussing
these other studies of direct measurement. See for example: Harasti, D., Lee, KA., Laird, R.,
Bradford, R. and Bruce., B. (2016). Use of baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs)
to estimate relative abundance and size of juvenile white sharks Carcharodon carcharias.
Marine and Freshwater Research. http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF16184.
Response: A paragraph discussing other studies that have employed non-visual methods for
estimating white shark size has been added in which the suggested reference has been added:
“Stereo-photogrammetry has recently been used to measure a broad range of shark species
including C. carcharias [43], R. typus [14], oceanic whitetip sharks, Carcharhinus
longimanus [8] and sandbar sharks, Carcharhinus plumbeus [44], as it replaces the need to
capture individuals. Stereo-photogrammetry uses two cameras recording simultaneous
footage and specialised software to record point-to-point measurements [45]. The method is
effective underwater, with Harvey et al. [46] quantifying the accuracy of the technique by
comparing stereo-obtained measurements of southern bluefin tuna, Thunnus maccoyii, to true
length measured directly, and found a difference of 0.16%. Despite the proven ability of
stereo-camera technology to capture accurate measurements of C. carcharias, visual
estimates are still favoured as a method due to the ease and reduced cost.”
We thank the reviewer for their comment and their efforts finding a detailed source to
contribute to the discussion on stereo-camera technology.
2) P6 37-55: There needs to be much more information provide about the stereo-camera
system used in regards how were they calibrated, what were the calibration tests and what
was the camera accuracy. Below are some specific questions
How were the cameras calibrated? Was a calibration cube used?
How often was the camera calibration checked? Was it done just once or throughout the
entire study? Did the camera need to recalibrated at all?
Was a known length scale bar used to test calibration?
How do you know that the cameras were providing accurate estimates?
Provide error estimates for the calibration tests and provide some data summarising the
calibration tests. This will help demonstrate the accuracy of measurements from the stereo-
camera system.
Can you provide an estimate of the size of the field of view or detection range of the
cameras?
Response: The following text was added to the methods in response to the reviewer’s
comments:
“The stereo-camera was calibrated with the CAL-Stereo Camera Calibration software, a
distance bar, and calibration cube (1000 x 1000 x 500 mm; www.seagis.com.au). With the
stereo-camera immobilised underwater, the calibration cube was manually rotated in different
positions within the field of view of both cameras to ensure a range of calibration points at
varying angles and distances. The distance bar is a horizontal bar 1.3 m long that is used to
independently check calibration accuracy by constantly rotating and shifting the angle of the
bar while moving closer to the camera. Recalibration of the stereo-camera was undertaken
three times during the study period, with approximately six months between each calibration,
to avoid inaccurate measurements due to shifts in camera angles from handling and operating
the stereo-camera units. The mean level of error between true length and stereo-camera
measurement was 0.42 cm, indicating a very high level of accuracy and reliability.”
How many measurements of each shark were used? Was an average measurement taken
based on different passes/angle/frames? Or just one single measurement taken? More info is
required.
The following text was added to address the reviewer’s questions: “Each individual shark
was measured in as many suitable passes as possible during each video, which resulted in a
different number of measurements taken for each shark. Average measurement of all passes
was calculated for each shark.”

Response: Corrected to “non-specialist volunteers to estimate size of C. carcharias should be
