The manuscript reports the synthesis of pyranoquinolinone based Schiff's bases. Cytotoxic
activity and inhibition of topoisomerase 2ß of pyranoquinolinone based Schiff's bases were
evaluated. Molecular docking study was also carried out for the investigation of binding ability
of Schiff's bases with topoisomerase 2ß. Some Schiff's bases were found to exhibit good cytotoxic
activity, when compared to that of the reference drug, doxorubicin. However, the weakness of
this work is that the number of compounds investigated is too small (only 7 compounds).
Overall, this manuscript contains useful information for readers, therefore it is recommended for
publication after minor revision. Comments and suggestions are listed below.
1. Title: the word “TOP 2ß” should be replaced by “Topoisomerase 2ß”. This is because
readers in other fields can understand directly. Please also use “topoisomerase 2ß” in the
abstract.
2. Title: Should be the first letter of each word all capitalized?
3. “Etoposide one of the major inhibitors for TOP 2B” should be revised to “Etoposide is one of
the major inhibitors for TOP 2B”.

The manuscript describes the docking study for Schiff bases of a known compound, prepared by
authors. Although azomethine and nitro groups are usually avoided in drugs due to toxicity and
unspecific activity, the authors found potent compounds with possible application as anti-cancer
3
agents. The docking data seem to be supported by the experiment, but details of the experimental
evaluation are obscured. It is not clear, how the IC50 values were obtained. In addition, the
quality of the text is poor. To me, it seems that the text is not properly proof-checked, or this is
not the final version of the manuscript. There are many fragments highlighted in yellow with no
particular reason, and many misprints. The English style is also not perfect, for example:
“The overall structure of the hTOP2B core dimer adopts a more open quaternary conformation
than in other DNA-bound structures reported 9 with significant changes...” – not finished
sentence?
“Etoposide one of the major inhibitors for TOP 2B” --> “Etoposide is one of the major inhibitors
for TOP 2B”;
“a new skeletons of Schiff’s bases” – an odd phrase;
“using prepare ligand protocol” --> “using prepared ligand protocol”;
“conformor” --> “conformer”;
“shoed” --> “showed”;
“stabilize the active conformer in the binding pocket more” – wrong word order; etc. etc.
The figures contain many non-explained details. Molecular weights in the tables are redundant.
Spectral data of the synthesized compounds are trivial, there is no need to discuss them in the
main text. Taking into account the above, I would not recommend publishing the manuscript in
the present form.
