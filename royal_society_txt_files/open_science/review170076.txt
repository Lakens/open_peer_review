This paper does not present any actual data. I would expect to see reall figures on survival of
fledglings to breeding age by El Nino vs La Nina years, since that is your main topic. Then see
figures on adult survival, and older adult survival. The paper, as it stands, is not useful to anyone
studying survival because of the lack of any data. (Appendix A)

This manuscript reports an original analysis of delayed effects of early life conditions on
reproductive and survival performance during adulthood in a seabird, the blue-footed booby.
From a very high quality data set (> 8000 known-aged birds monitored for 26 years), the authors
found that being born in years with warm water leads to decrease recruitment but does not
influence survival later in life and that warm water during a given year negatively influences
prime-age adult survival in that year. These results are potentially important and are likely to
attract a broad range of readers. However, I found a major flaw in the CMR analysis that needs to
be solved.
The multi-state CMR modelling (with age included as a state) as performed here is not
appropriate because, by definition, not all individuals in a given age group will have the same
probability to transit to the next age group. For instance, within the mature adults, all the 7 years-
old birds but none of the 6 years-old bird will transit to the senescent stage (psiMS parameter
here). This problem has been addressed thoroughly by Mollet & Cailliet (Mar. Freshwater Res.
2002). It is therefore required to fit truly age-dependent CMR models. This would allow the
authors to assess the influence of early life conditions on reproductive and actuarial senescence
(see e.g. Nussey et al. 2007 Curr Biol. for a case study on red deer). Moreover, it would be more
appropriate to include individual birds when they come to breed for the first time in the analysis.
3
This would allow avoiding the fixed capture probability to 0 for fledging and the heterogenity in
capture probability at later ages in relation to the breeding status, which could explain the
strange resighting patterns displayed in the supplementary figures.
In addition, the following minor problems have to be solved:
l. 18-19 and 48-49 and 56-57: Partly true only. See e.g. Nussey et al. 2007 Curr Biol or Garratt et al.
2015 Curr Biol for case studies addressing that question.
l. 51: "important" instead of "significant"
l. 57-59: Well, this is a bit overstated. Lemaitre et al. (2015 PRSB) recently reviewed evidence for
costs of early allocation to reproduction in terms of senescence in vertebrates.
l. 162-169: This part can be reduced markedly. While the conclusion is right, there is no need to
discuss the effect of SST on fledging survival because this model is not competitive (more
parameters and higher AIC value).
l. 177: "statistically significant" instead of "significant"
l. 241: "allocate" instead of "invest"
l. 251: "important" instead of "significant"
The figures as they stand are useless. Observed data (raw estimates) should be displayed in
addition to the model.

This revised version has much improved. However, I still have concern about the CMR analysis
of adult survival as currently performed. The authors collected an exceptionally high quality
dataset corresponding to 26 years of CMR data. The first step is thus to fit a fully age-dependent
model and then try to reduce the number of parameters (only 23 will be identifiable from the full
age-dependent model if the longest bird reached 23 years at the most). The authors need to check
that their 14 age-class models provides a reliable picture of the full age-dependence. Moreover,
some biological justification has to be provided for fitting this 14 age-class model. The authors
should also considered continuous age-dependent models that usually provide good fit to age-
specific survival (e.g. Gompertz model or Weibull models). It is really crucial for readers to know
more about age-dependence and the graphical display of the full age-dependent model should be
provided. From this basis, it should be easier for readers to understand whether the authors’s
interpretation that pooling ages from 7 to 16 in previous studies caused the difference in results
with the present work.
In addition, the following points need to be fixed:
l. 50: « start » instead of « starts »
l. 159: « age-dependent models » instead of « age models »
l. 160-161: Where is the evidence that no survival difference occurred among fledglings, 1-, 2 -and
3-year-olds? I certainly agree that birds were not reproductive at these ages, but marked
differences in survival might occur independently of the reproductive status.
l. 166-168: From my experience with fitting CMR models to study actuarial senescence, this
statement is not true. I certainly agree that the confidence intervals of age-specific survival
beyond 15 years of age will be quite large, there is no a priori reason to pool these ages within a
same class. Show first evidence that there is little difference in survival between 16 and older
ages.
l. 191-192: Alternatively, you could test an influence of SSTA on the parameters of a continuous
8
function of age-dependence (e.g. intercept that corresponds to the baseline survival and slope
that corresponds to the aging rate in a Gompertz model).
l. 272: « lifespan » instead of « age-span »
l. 284: « lay » instead of « establish a clutch »

I thank the authors for having considered my comments thoroughly. At this stage, I do not think I
could ask more. The MS reads well and reports a highly relevant case study. The authors chose
not to run Gompertz model, which is perfectly acceptable. My only and last (minor) request is the
requirement of a table in the Supplementary Material that will display the full age-specific
estimates of survival with SE. This information would be highly useful for all readers interested
by senescence in the wild.

Comments to the Author(s)
I thank the authors for having considered my comments thoroughly. At this stage, I do not think I
could ask more. The MS reads well and reports a highly relevant case study. The authors chose
not to run Gompertz model, which is perfectly acceptable. My only and last (minor) request is the
requirement of a table in the Supplementary Material that will display the full age-specific
estimates of survival with SE. This information would be highly useful for all readers interested
by senescence in the wild.

3 16 1. Summary
4
5
6 17 In wild long-lived animals, analysis of impacts of stressful natal conditions on adult
7
8 18 performance has rarely embraced the entire age-span, and the possibility that costs are
9
10 19 expressed late in life goes largely untested. A 26-year study of 8,541 fledglings of a
11
12 20 marine bird that can live up to 23 years tested whether experiencing the warm waters
13
14
21 and food scarcity associated with El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the natal
15
16
17 22 year prejudices recruitment or survival over the adult lifetime. Warm water in the
18
19 23 natal year reduced a blue-footed booby’s (Sula nebouxii) probability of recruiting; this
20
21 24 effect was independent of conditions in the current year. Warm water in the current
22
23 25 year impacted adult survival, with greater effect in middle age than during early or
24
25
26 26 late adulthood. However, warm water in the natal year did not affect survival at any
27
28 27 age over the lifespan. Harsh natal conditions prejudices recruitment. Nonetheless, a
29
30 28 previous study showed that early recruitment and widely spaced breeding allow it to
31
32 29 achieve normal fledgling production over the first 10 years, and our results show that
33
34
30 this reproductive effort incurs no survival penalty, not even late in life. This pattern
35
36
37 31 suggests successful buffering against stressful natal conditions via life history
38
39 32 adjustments.

44 34 2. Introduction
45
46 35 Early-life exposure to stressful conditions may have short- or long-term fitness
47
48 36 consequences [1,2]. Food shortage, disease, extreme weather or high population
49
50
37 density during pre- or postnatal development may translate into reduced birth weight,
51
52
53 38 growth or pre-breeding survival [1,3]. Developing offspring can sometimes get over a
54
55 39 poor start in life yet pay delayed costs of initial setbacks or compensatory responses
56
57 40 triggered by poor early-life conditions [4]. Delayed costs of early-life stresses can be
58
59
60 2
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 3 of 23 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 41 expressed as shortened longevity or reduced lifetime reproductive success [5,6], or
4
5 42 accelerated senescence [7]. Nonetheless, recent long-term studies show that in nature
6
7
43 early-life stresses can also elicit changes in life-history traits that allow organisms to
8
9
10 44 mitigate or neutralize their potential impacts on fitness [8,9].
11
12 45 Whether we detect vulnerability or resilience to early-life stresses may depend
13
14 46 on the nature of the stress (i.e., origin, magnitude, timing, and duration) but also on
15
16 47 the ability of studies to estimate impacts on diverse fitness components over the
17
18
19 48 lifespan [2,9]. Impacts of early-life stresses after sexual maturity, however, remain
20
21 49 largely unexplored [1,10], and since the evidence for delayed costs of poor starts in
22
23 50 life comes mainly from experiments in captivity, we know little about how pervasive
24
25 51 and significant these impacts are in nature [9,11].
26
27
52 Potentially, early-life stresses may give rise to differences among cohorts in
28
29
30 53 recruitment and adult survival, and translate into demographic changes [1,10,12,13].
31
32 54 Survival costs of a poor start in life during early adulthood have been extensively
33
34 55 documented by experiments using captive members of short-lived species [14–17].
35
36 56 However, comparable impacts have seldom been examined in long-lived species
37
38
39 57 under natural conditions [9,18] and the general expectation that natural selection
40
41 58 favors costs being expressed late in life (when expression is less likely) goes largely
42
43 59 untested. Additionally, our knowledge of how early-life environments influence
44
45 60 recruitment rates in nature is particularly limited [19–21].
46
47
61 Using the blue-footed booby as a model organism, we tested whether food
48
49
50 62 shortage and other challenges associated with El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
51
52 63 during the natal year (spanning from prenatal to early post-fledging development)
53
54 64 translate into impaired recruitment and increased mortality in the adult stage through
55
56 65 age 23 years. Delayed costs arising from developmental impacts of ENSO have been

3 66 tested in only two species. In the black-browed albatross (Thalassarche
4
5 67 melanophrys), immature survival declined but timing of recruitment was unaffected
6
7
68 [22]; in our study species, birds recruited earlier and avoided costs on longevity and
8
9
10 69 breeding success over at least the first 10 years of life by means of other life history
11
12 70 adjustments [23]. Nonetheless, whether costs of natal ENSO conditions are expressed
13
14 71 as reductions in recruitment and adult survival, and whether these costs are evident
15
16 72 only much later in life (after 10 years of age) remain as open questions. We expected
17
18
19 73 relatively low recruitment and survival of adult male and female boobies that
20
21 74 experienced warm water ENSO conditions during the year when they were born and
22
23 75 fledged. Such long-term developmental impacts of ENSO have the potential to
24
25 76 influence population dynamics [23,24], and their appraisal may provide important
26
27
77 insights into the ability of wild populations to respond to major climatic changes
28
29
30 78 [2,9].

34 80 3. Materials and methods
35
36
37 81 Study system
38
39 82 We used data spanning 26 years (1988 – 2013) from a colony of blue-footed boobies
40
41 83 on Isla Isabel, Mexico. This insular population is located in the eastern tropical
42
43 84 Pacific and sustains itself largely on the anchovies and herrings of the surrounding
44
45
46 85 oceanic waters [25]. Nestling growth, recruitment, adult survivorship and
47
48 86 reproduction in this population decrease when local ocean warming in the course of
49
50 87 an ENSO event depletes local productivity and prey availability [26,27]. Male and
51
52 88 female boobies generally recruit at age 2 – 6 years [28,29] and can live 20 years or
53
54
55
89 more [30; this study]. Their breeding success increases gradually up to age 8 – 11
56
57 90 years and declines progressively thereafter [31,32]. Both sexes are permanently

3 91 faithful to their first breeding sites and rarely disperse long distances from the natal
4
5 92 colony [33,34].
6
7
93 Our sample consisted of 8,541 fledglings that were systematically ringed and
8
9
10 94 resighted as breeders (with clutch or brood) in the course of annual censuses every 3-
11
12 95 6 d during five months (February –July) in a fixed study area (26,889 m2) [28]. We
13
14 96 based our analyses exclusively on resightings during April and May to meet the
15
16 97 assumption of capture–recapture analyses that the time spanned between capture
17
18
19 98 occasions (e.g., 12 months) must be substantially longer than the duration of the
20
21 99 capture events (e.g., 2 months) [35]. During April – May, a representative sample of
22
23 100 fledglings that are ringed and recorded as breeders annually can be obtained [36].
24
25 101 Fledglings that were recorded as breeders for the first time either at age 1 year (n = 8)
26
27
102 or 7 – 16 years (n = 412) were excluded from the analysis in order to avoid bias in
28
29
30 103 demographic estimates: most 1 year old recruits were recorded as breeders only once
31
32 104 in 26 years, making it impossible to attribute their early disappearance to either
33
34 105 mortality or emigration; whereas 7 – 16 years old recruits may have bred earlier in life
35
36 106 but escaped sampling [29]. Fledglings were sexed by voice when they recruited
37
38
39 107 (females grunt, males whistle). Inter-annual variation in resighting probability in this
40
41 108 colony is expected to be almost entirely due to variation in breeding probability, and
42
43 109 estimation of demographic rates may suffer from little bias associated with permanent
44
45 110 emigration [26,29].
46
47
111 ENSO conditions experienced by boobies in early life were indexed by the
48
49
50 112 average sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA, C°) in the waters surrounding Isla
51
52 113 Isabel during the natal calendar year. Positive values of SSTA denote warm El Niño
53
54 114 conditions and potential reductions in food quality and quantity; negative values
55
56 115 denote cold La Niña conditions [25,37]. We obtained monthly average values of

11
12 120
13
14 121 Capture-recapture analysis
15
16 122 We analyzed the 26-year mark-recapture data by means of a multi-state framework
17
18
19 123 implemented in program MARK [38–40]. Individuals were classified as either
20
21 124 fledglings, young adults (2-7 years), mature adults (8-11 years), or senescent adults
22
23 125 (12 years or older) following Beamonte-Barrientos et al [32]. We focused on
24
25 126 estimating three parameters: apparent survival (S), recapture rate (p), and rate of
26
27
28
127 transition between categories (<U+03C8>). In particular, we considered the transition between
29
30 128 fledglings and young adults (<U+03C8>fy) as the rate at which new reproductive adults are
31
32 129 incorporated into the colony (recruitment rate). To avoid fitting an unnecessarily large
33
34
130 number of models to our data, we used in all the competing models described below
35
36
37 131 the best-supported parameterization for p and for the transition rates between young
38
39 132 and mature adults (<U+03C8>ym) and between mature and senescent adults (<U+03C8>ms) (further
40
41 133 details and estimates of these parameters can be found in Appendix S1 and Figure S1
42
43
134 in Supporting Information).
44
45
46 135 We built competing linear models in MARK to test the potential impact of
47
48 136 SSTA during the natal year (SSTAn) on recruitment of new adults (<U+03C8>fy). We also
49
50 137 tested the impact of SSTAn on annual survival of fledglings and adults of all age
51
52
138 categories. In addition, we considered the possibility that a potential interaction
53
54
55 139 between natal (SSTAn) and current conditions (SSTA during the current year =
56
57 140 SSTAc) affected adult survival. In all cases, we tested these hypotheses considering

1
2
3 141 potential differences between sexes and age categories. In total, we fitted 240
4
5 142 competing models to our mark-recapture data. The complete list of models can be
6
7
143 found in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Given that fledglings are resighted only
8
9
10 144 after they return to the colony as breeders [28], we set the annual recapture rate of
11
12 145 fledglings as equal to zero in all models.
13
14 146 We used our general model (sex × age category × year in most parameters
15
16
147 excepting p, <U+03C8>ym, and <U+03C8>ms, see Appendix S1) to calculate ^ as a measure of goodness
17
18
19 148 of fit [41]. Our estimated ^ indicated moderate overdispersion (1.775). Therefore, to
20
21 149 select the model with the greatest fit to our mark-recapture data we used the quasi-
22
23 150 likelihood version of the Akaike information criterion (QAICc), which accounted for
24
25
151 this degree of overdispersion. We also calculated Akaike weights as estimates of the
26
27
28 152 relative support for each model [41]. Given that climatic covariates usually cannot
29
30 153 account for all the interannual variation in demographic parameters, we used the F
31
32 154 statistic proposed by Grosbois et al. [42] to test if the particular combination of
33
34 155 explanatory variables selected by QAICc accounted for a statistically significant
35
36
37
156 proportion of the observed interannual variation in recruitment and survival. In
38
39 157 addition, we calculated the proportion of deviance explained by our most supported
40
41 158 model as a measure of effect size (R2_Dev). An R2_Dev > 0.2 indicates that the
42
43 159 explanatory variables selected by QAICc can indeed be considered as influential [42].

49
50 162 Two models had strong support in our data (their QAICc scores were the lowest and
51
52
163 differed in less than 2 units from each other; table 1). Both models included an
53
54
55 164 interaction between sex and SSTAn affecting <U+03C8>fy and an interaction between age
56
57 165 category and SSTAc affecting adult S. In the top model, fledgling S was not affected
58
59
60 7

Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 8 of 23
1
2
3 166 by sex or SSTAn, whereas in the second it was affected by SSTAn. However, the
4
5 167 estimated slope of this effect of SSTAn on fledgling S was not statistically different
6
7
8
168 than zero (ß = 0.07; 95% CI = -0.31 - 0.45). Thus, we based our inferences
9
10 169 exclusively on the top model.
11
12 170 Recruitment of adult boobies varied as a negative function of SSTAn.
13
14 171 Individuals that were born in years when sea water was relatively warm experienced a
15
16
17 172 substantially lower annual probability of returning to the colony as adult breeders
18
19 173 compared with individuals that were born in years when the water was relatively cold
20
21 174 (Figure 1a). According to the top model, this negative relationship between <U+03C8>fy and
22
23
175 SSTAn differed between sexes, with females more affected than males, but this
24
25
26 176 difference between sexes was slight (Figure 1a). This interaction between sex and
27
28 177 SSTAn was significant (F3,44 = 6.64, P < 0.001) and explained a considerable
29
30 178 proportion of total interannual variation in <U+03C8>fy (R2_Dev = 0.31).
31
32
179 The impact of sea temperature in the current year on adult survival varied
33
34
35 180 among age categories (Table 1). Annual S of young and mature adults was
36
37 181 remarkably high (close to 1) at low values of SSTAc, but decreased precipitously in
38
39 182 young adults at values above 0.6 and more gradually in mature adults at values above
40
41 183 0.0 (Figure 1b). Annual S of senescent adults was lower overall than in the other adult
42
43
44 184 categories and showed progressive but negligible decline as SSTAc increased (Figure
45
46 185 1b). This interaction between SSTAc and age category was statistically significant
47
48 186 (F5,104 = 2.45, P = 0.038) and explained 11% of total interannual variation in adult
49
50 187 survival (R2_Dev = 0.11).
51
52
188 The impact of sea temperature in the natal year on adult survival, on the other
53
54
55 189 hand, was minor or nonexistent. The first model that included SSTAn had only 3.5%
56
57 190 of relative support (Table 1).

4
5
6 192 This study of the blue-footed booby provides three main results. First, probability of
7
8 193 recruitment during adult life declines with increase in sea temperature during the natal
9
10 194 year. Second, the developmental impact of ENSO on recruitment is independent of
11
12 195 the oceanographic conditions male and female boobies experience as adults. Third,
13
14
196 adult survival over the age-span of the species is not prejudiced by warm sea
15
16
17 197 temperature during the natal year.
18
19 198 On average, an extra 1.4°C in the natal year meant a reduction of roughly 80%
20
21 199 in annual recruiting probabilities. This result may be due to reduced physiological
22
23 200 condition of birds born in stressful (warm) years [27,43]. Warming of surface waters
24
25
26 201 associated with ENSO depletes ocean productivity [24,37], with consequent
27
28 202 reductions in food quality and quantity for seabirds [25,44]. Boobies born in ENSO
29
30 203 years fledge with a low body mass [23,27] and recruiting demands considerable
31
32 204 energy [45,46] because it involves sexual maturation, mate acquisition, and territory
33
34
205 defense [47]. Individuals stressed by natal ENSO conditions may be less competitive
35
36
37 206 in these domains and consequently less likely to pair and establish a clutch [2,10].
38
39 207 An earlier analysis of individual life histories showed that boobies born in
40
41 208 warm ENSO years recruit at a younger age, space their breeding events more widely
42
43 209 and, during the first 10 years at least, fledge as many chicks as boobies born in cool-
44
45
46 210 water years [23]. Our results further reveal that for boobies from warm years
47
48 211 probability of recruitment is low but annual survival is undiminished, even in old age.
49
50 212 Thus, they show that when boobies buffer against harsh natal conditions by making
51
52 213 life history adjustments they pay no delayed survival penalty, although an analysis of
53
54
55
214 lifetime reproductive success is still needed.

3 215 Developmental impacts of ENSO on recruitment are independent of
4
5 216 oceanographic conditions during particular breeding attempts (the interaction between
6
7
217 natal and current SSTA was not statistically supported). Hence, boobies born in El
8
9
10 218 Niño years are no more disposed to make a first attempt at breeding in El Niño years
11
12 219 than those born in La Niña years. This result contradicts an expectation of the
13
14 220 Predictive Adaptive Response hypothesis [2,48]: experience of ENSO-related stresses
15
16 221 in the natal year does not predispose individuals to breed under similar conditions
17
18
19 222 later in life, implying that they are not specially prepared for them. Similar
20
21 223 independence between developmental conditions and effects of current environmental
22
23 224 conditions has been repeatedly documented in wild populations [7,22,49,but see 50].
24
25 225 The impact of ENSO conditions in the current breeding year on adult survival
26
27
226 varied among age categories, with mature adults at the height of their reproductive
28
29
30 227 capacity (8 – 11 years) [31,32] being the most affected by warm waters. For them,
31
32 228 moderate warming (~0.4°C above the historical mean) implies a reduction of ~50% in
33
34 229 probability of survival. Young (2 – 7 years) and senescent (> 12 years) adults are
35
36 230 affected less. Survival of young adults is affected only when surface waters are
37
38
39 231 extremely warm (> 0.7 °C above the historical mean), and survival of senescent adults
40
41 232 shows minimal effects across the whole range of water temperatures. These
42
43 233 differential impacts of current ENSO conditions on survival of young, old and
44
45 234 senescent boobies may reflect age-dependent trade-offs [51]. Even in warm-water
46
47
235 years, mature adults may take advantage of their high reproductive potential by
48
49
50 236 increasing their reproductive effort [32,52], at a cost to their ability to survive
51
52 237 environmental stresses [51]. In contrast, young breeders are generally expected to
53
54 238 limit their reproductive effort because their residual reproductive value is high [53],
55
56 239 and in late life reproductive effort is expected to be restrained [54]. Consistent with

3 240 the latter prediction, an experiment demonstrated that old male blue-footed boobies
4
5 241 normally invest less in reproduction than they are capable of [31].
6
7
242 Our survival estimates for young adults are ~20% higher than those reported
8
9
10 243 by an earlier mark-recapture study [26]. This inconsistency is likely because the
11
12 244 previous study was based on five months of field sampling each year, resulting in
13
14 245 high resighting probabilities and consequent low survival estimates, whereas the
15
16 246 current study was based on only two months of sampling to satisfy the requirement
17
18
19 247 that capture events be substantially briefer than the time spanned between them [35].

22
23 249 6. Conclusion
24
25
26 250 This study contributes to our still limited knowledge of how early-life environments
27
28 251 influence vital rates in nature [10,18,21], and provides significant insights into the
29
30 252 long-term fitness consequences arising from developmental effects of ENSO. Our
31
32 253 results also have conservation implications: harsh climatic conditions reduce not only
33
34
254 ongoing recruitment but also recruitment prospects of newborns, two processes which
35
36
37 255 may entail subsequent reductions in population growth [13,18,24,29].

Appendix B
Dear editors,
We are very grateful for the comments made by you and the reviewers. Please find attached our
arefully revised MS.
We have implemented the analytical change suggested by reviewer 2: we now use true age
models to test whether El Niño conditions experienced in the natal year influence annual survival
robabilities of adult boobies at different ages. This new approach does not allow us to test
imultaneously whether El Niño conditions in the natal year predict fledglings’ probability of
ecruiting because age models are based on adults, exclusively. Therefore we examined impacts of
l Niño on recruitment by testing logistic Generalised Linear Mixed Models in R. Importantly, the
main patterns in the results did not change from our original submission: experiencing El Niño
onditions during early life reduces recruiting probabilities but not adult survival.
We have implemented all other minor corrections and clarifications requested by you and the two
eviewers. We hope you will find our responses to your requested changes satisfactory. We look
orward to hearing from you.
With regards,
ergio Ancona

his paper does not present any actual data. I would expect to see real figures on survival of
ledglings to breeding age by El Nino vs La Nina years, since that is your main topic. Then see
igures on adult survival, and older adult survival. The paper, as it stands, is not useful to anyone
tudying survival because of the lack of any data.
Our response: We now display actual data in our figures.
eviewer: 2
omments to the Author(s)
his manuscript reports an original analysis of delayed effects of early life conditions on
eproductive and survival performance during adulthood in a seabird, the blue-footed booby.
rom a very high quality data set (> 8000 known-aged birds monitored for 26 years), the authors
ound that being born in years with warm water leads to decrease recruitment but does not
nfluence survival later in life and that warm water during a given year negatively influences prime-
ge adult survival in that year. These results are potentially important and are likely to attract a
road range of readers. However, I found a major flaw in the CMR analysis that needs to be
olved.
he multi-state CMR modelling (with age included as a state) as performed here is not appropriate
ecause, by definition, not all individuals in a given age group will have the same probability to
ransit to the next age group. For instance, within the mature adults, all the 7 years-old birds but
one of the 6 years-old bird will transit to the senescent stage (psiMS parameter here). This
roblem has been addressed thoroughly by Mollet & Cailliet (Mar. Freshwater Res. 2002). It is
herefore required to fit truly age-dependent CMR models. This would allow the authors to assess
he influence of early life conditions on reproductive and actuarial senescence (see e.g. Nussey et
l. 2007 Curr Biol. for a case study on red deer). Moreover, it would be more appropriate to
nclude individual birds when they come to breed for the first time in the analysis. This would
llow avoiding the fixed capture probability to 0 for fledging and the heterogenity in capture
robability at later ages in relation to the breeding status, which could explain the strange
esighting patterns displayed in the supplementary figures.
Our response: As suggested, we have fitted age-dependent CMR models to capture-recapture
istories of adult boobies (i.e., individuals recorded with a partner and a clutch), exclusively.
n addition, the following minor problems have to be solved:
. 18-19 and 48-49 and 56-57: Partly true only. See e.g. Nussey et al. 2007 Curr Biol or Garratt et al.
015 Curr Biol for case studies addressing that question.
Our response: We have adjusted these assertions and included the suggested references (lines
8-19, 49-50, and 57-58).
. 51: "important" instead of "significant"
Our response: We have replaced “significant” with “important”, as suggested (line 52).
. 57-59: Well, this is a bit overstated. Lemaitre et al. (2015 PRSB) recently reviewed evidence for
osts of early allocation to reproduction in terms of senescence in vertebrates.
Our response: We have moderated this statement. Now we say that “the general expectation
hat natural selection favors costs being expressed late in life (when expression is less likely)
eeds to be evaluated more extensively in natural populations”, and cite the suggested
eference (lines 57-60).
. 162-169: This part can be reduced markedly. While the conclusion is right, there is no need to
iscuss the effect of SST on fledging survival because this model is not competitive (more
arameters and higher AIC value).
Our response: This section no longer exists in our revised paper.
. 177: "statistically significant" instead of "significant"
Our response: This section no longer exists in our revised paper.
. 241: "allocate" instead of "invest"
Our response: This section no longer exists in our revised paper.
. 251: "important" instead of "significant"
Our response: We have replaced “significant” with “important” in this sentence (line 321).
he figures as they stand are useless. Observed data (raw estimates) should be displayed in
ddition to the model.
Our response: We now display observed data along with the estimated values for survival and
ecruitment probabilities in our figures.
.M. Gaillard
dditional comments by editors/reviewers on the submitted PDF
ine 20: should use the name of the bird here. Don't keep people guessing.
Our response: We now provide the name of the study species earlier in the summary (line 20), as
equested.
ine 21: ENSO actually refers to the whole cycle, the warm event of El Nino and the cold
vent of La Nina. So it is most correct to refer to El Nino if you are only talking about the warm
vent.
Our response: We have modified this sentence as suggested (line 22), and now we use “El Niño”
hroughout the paper to refer to the warm phase of the cycle.
ine 32: Throughout the paper you refer to survival rates increasing or decreasing but you don't
ive any of the rates, or the tests of the significance of the changes in them. You need to present
he data. You also talk about fledgling production (generally called reproductive success) so you
eed to give the actual data you are talking about. Without the data, the paper becomes a
eneralization, as you might find in a popular paper.
Our response: In the previous version of our paper, we provided the p value for the interaction
etween SSTA in the current year and age, and indicated that this interaction explained 11% of
otal interannual variation in adult survival. See line 186 in the first version of the MS. In our
evised paper, we have removed this result because we have changed our modelling (i.e., we
ow use age-models instead of multistate models) as suggested by Prof J-M Gaillard, and along
with the new results, we provide actual data on adult survival probabilities in “Results” section
lines 252-265) and in figure 1.
Data on fledgling production are not needed in this study focused on the impacts of El Niño
onditions in the natal year on fledglings’ probability of recruiting and on adult survival. In the
ummary, we mention that “a previous study showed that early recruitment and widely spaced
reeding allow boobies born in El Niño years to achieve normal fledgling production over the
irst 10 years”. Here there is no need to repeat an analysis that is already published (Ancona S,
Drummond H (2013) PLoS ONE 8(9): e72665).
ine 93: Remove “systematically” from here.
Our response: We have removed “systematically” from this sentence (line 94)
ine 179: do you mean to say on 'adult survival in the following years"?
Our response: We mean annual survival rates of 4 – 23 year old adults. In order to make this
more clear, we have modified this sentence as follows “According to our best-fitting model, the
mpact of sea temperature in the current year on annual survival rates of booby adults varied
mong ages” (lines 250-251).
ine 181: why don't you give the actual survival figure here? Like .98 or whatever it is. The paper
eems to have no data in it - more like it was written for something like Audubon magazine.
Our response: In our revised paper, we provide data on actual changes in adult survival
ssociated with variation in the SSTA during the current year (lines 252-265).
ine 196: do you mean it's not "affected by".
Our response: We have modified this sentence as requested (line 272).
ines 202-205: but if they didn't recruit to the colony, they didn't have the excess energy drain of
ourting and defending a territory. If they were there courting, you would have recaptured them.
Our response: Probability of recruiting in our study reflects this process too as we only recapture
oobies that are recorded with a partner and a clutch in the colony. We specified this in Methods
lines 94-95).
ines 207-210: How can they fledge as many chicks if they space their breeding out more widely?
Our response: Boobies born during El Niño years take more sabbaticals, but during the first 10
ears at least, fledge as many chicks as boobies born in cool-water years, essentially because
heir breeding attempts are successful during this 10-year period (Ancona S, Drummond H (2013)
LoS ONE 8(9): e72665). We have added this explanation to make this statement more clear
lines 285-289).
ine 208: do you mean here that they didn't breed every year? Need to say what this means -
pace breeding more widely
Our response: We now specify that “spacing their breeding events more widely” means skipping
more breeding attempts, and we have added a supporting reference (line 287).
ine 213: "Delayed survival" doesn't have any meaning. You mean survival as they age. But you
an just eliminate the one word here and it's fine.
Our response: We have removed “delayed” from this sentence, as requested (lines 292-293).
ine 215: What do you mean the "developmental impacts of an ENSO"? Are you trying to say "The
ffects of an El Nino on development of the chick? Need to re-word if so.
Our response: This sentence no longer exists in our revised paper.
ines 217-219: This makes total sense to me. these birds breed every year for the most part -
whether it's an El Nino or La Nina. No reason to expect that being hatched in 1 event would make
ou breed only in those years in the future. Probably not worth mentioning
Our response: This section on the Predictive Adaptive Response hypothesis no longer exists in
ur revised MS.
ines 225-241: Personally, I'd leave this paragraph out.
Our response: We kept a shortened/simplified version of this paragraph in our revised MS (lines
98-308) just to offer an explanation for this peripheral result, but we may remove it if you
onsider it unnecessary.
ines 228-230: You need to give the actual figures here on survival of the age group - like
decreased from .98 to .52). It carries no weight if you don't present the data.
Our response: In our revised MS we present these figures (lines 252-265 and 298-308).
ine 234: Definition of senescent that you are using? Often used for no longer breeding birds and
f that is the case, there is no reproductive trade-off.
Our response: This categorisation no longer exists in our revised MS as we changed our
modelling as suggested by Prof Gaillard.
ines 235-236: Birds don't "take advantage" of their potential, as if they thought about it. They do
what they are driven to do. If they can catch enough food to get in to breeding condition, they
reed. I would re-word this to be more accurate.
Our response: We were not talking about intention here; we regret this was not clear enough.
nyway, due to analytical changes suggested by J-M Gaillard, this discussion no longer exists in
ur revised MS.
ine 239: Why is it expected to be restrained? Do you have a reason?
Our response: This section no longer exists in our revised MS. The eliminated statement is based
n a theoretical study (McNamara, J. M. et al. (2009) Proc. R. Soc. London B Biol. Sci. 276, 4061–
066.) showing that older individuals may refrain from terminal investment, thereby extending
heir reproductive lifespan and increasing their fitness.
ines 242-243: Give the comparison figures here, and some idea of significance levels.
Our response: This section no longer exists in our revised MS.
ine 251: Change: “survival of different age classes of birds” instead of “vital rates”
Our response: We prefer to leave the original sentence as it stands because our study contributes
o understanding how early-life environments influence both recruitment and survival in wild
opulations (line 320-321).
ine 252: Change: “the effects of an El Niño event on fledging birds” instead of “developmental
ffects of ENSO”.

4
5
6 17 In wild long-lived animals, analysis of impacts of stressful natal conditions on adult
7
8 18 performance has rarely embraced the entire age-span, and the possibility that costs are
9
10 19 expressed late in life has seldom been examined. Using 26 years of data from 8,541
11
12 20 fledglings and 1,310 adults of the blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii), a marine bird
13
14
21 that can live up to 23 years, we tested whether experiencing the warm waters and food
15
16
17 22 scarcity associated with El Niño in the natal year reduces recruitment or survival over
18
19 23 the adult lifetime. Warm water in the natal year reduced the probability of recruiting;
20
21 24 each additional degree (°C) of water temperature meant a reduction of roughly 50% in
22
23 25 fledglings’ probability of returning to the natal colony as breeders. Warm water in the
24
25
26 26 current year impacted adult survival, with greater effect at the oldest ages than during
27
28 27 early adulthood. However, warm water in the natal year did not affect survival at any
29
30 28 age over the lifespan. Harsh natal conditions affected recruitment negatively.
31
32 29 Nonetheless, a previous study showed that early recruitment and widely spaced
33
34
30 breeding allow boobies to achieve normal fledgling production over the first 10 years,
35
36
37 31 and our results show that this reproductive effort incurs no survival penalty, not even
38
39 32 late in life. This pattern is additional evidence of buffering against stressful natal
40
41 33 conditions via life-history adjustments.

46 35 2. Introduction
47
48 36 Early-life exposure to stressful conditions may have short- or long-term fitness
49
50
37 consequences [1,2]. Food shortage, disease, extreme weather or high population
51
52
53 38 density during pre- or postnatal development may translate into reduced birth weight,
54
55 39 growth or pre-breeding survival [1,3]. Developing offspring can sometimes get over a
56
57 40 poor start in life yet pay delayed costs of initial setbacks or compensatory responses

3 41 triggered by poor early-life conditions [4]. Delayed costs of early-life stresses can be
4
5 42 expressed as shortened longevity or reduced lifetime reproductive success [5,6], or
6
7
43 accelerated senescence [7]. Nonetheless, recent long-term studies show that in nature
8
9
10 44 early-life stresses can also elicit changes in life-history traits that allow organisms to
11
12 45 mitigate or neutralize their potential impacts on fitness [8,9].
13
14 46 Whether we detect vulnerability or resilience to early-life stresses may depend
15
16 47 on the nature of the stress (i.e., origin, magnitude, timing, and duration) but also on
17
18
19 48 the ability of studies to estimate impacts on diverse fitness components over the
20
21 49 lifespan [2,9]. Impacts of early-life stresses after sexual maturity, however, are still
22
23 50 seldom explored [7,10,11], and since the evidence for delayed costs of poor starts in
24
25 51 life comes mainly from relatively short-term experiments in captivity, we know little
26
27
52 about how pervasive and important these impacts are in nature [9,12].
28
29
30 53 Potentially, early-life stresses may give rise to differences among cohorts in
31
32 54 recruitment and adult survival, and translate into demographic changes [1,10,13,14].
33
34 55 Survival costs of a poor start in life during early adulthood have been extensively
35
36 56 documented by experiments using captive members of short-lived species [15–18].
37
38
39 57 Comparable impacts have been examined only occasionally in long-lived species
40
41 58 under natural conditions [7,11,19] and the general expectation that natural selection
42
43 59 favors costs being expressed late in life (when expression is less likely) needs to be
44
45 60 evaluated more extensively in natural populations [20]. Additionally, our knowledge
46
47
61 of how early-life environments influence recruitment rates in nature is particularly
48
49
50 62 limited [21–23].
51
52 63 Using the blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii) as a model organism, we tested
53
54 64 whether food shortage and other challenges associated with El Niño conditions during
55
56 65 the natal year (spanning from prenatal to early post-fledging development) translate
57
58

2
3 66 into impaired recruitment and increased mortality in the adult stage through age 23
4
5 67 years. Delayed costs arising from impacts of El Niño during early development have
6
7
68 been tested in only two species. In the black-browed albatross (Thalassarche
8
9
10 69 melanophrys), immature survival declined but timing of recruitment was unaffected
11
12 70 [24]. In our study species, birds recruited earlier and avoided costs on longevity and
13
14 71 breeding success over at least the first 10 years of life by means of other life-history
15
16 72 adjustments [25]. Nonetheless, whether costs of natal El Niño conditions are
17
18
19 73 expressed as reductions in recruitment and adult survival, and whether these costs are
20
21 74 evident only much later in life (after 10 years of age) remain as open questions. We
22
23 75 expected relatively low recruitment and adult survival of boobies that experienced
24
25 76 warm water conditions associated with El Niño during the year when they were born
26
27
77 and fledged. Such long-term developmental impacts of El Niño have the potential to
28
29
30 78 influence population dynamics [25,26], and their appraisal may provide important
31
32 79 insights into the ability of wild populations to respond to major climatic changes
33
34 80 [2,9].

40
41 83 Study system
42
43 84 We used data spanning 26 years (1988 – 2013) from a colony of blue-footed boobies
44
45
46 85 on Isla Isabel, Mexico. This insular population is located in the eastern tropical
47
48 86 Pacific and sustains itself largely on the anchovies and herrings of the surrounding
49
50 87 oceanic waters [27]. Nestling growth, recruitment, adult survival and reproduction in
51
52 88 this population decrease when local ocean warming in the course of an El Niño event
53
54
55
89 depletes local productivity and prey availability [28,29]. Male and female boobies
56
57 90 generally recruit at age 2 – 6 years [30,31] and can live 20 years or more [32]. Their

3 91 breeding success increases gradually up to age 8 – 11 years and declines progressively
4
5 92 thereafter [33,34], although they can recover from age-related decay by skipping
6
7
93 breeding events [35].
8
9
10 94 Every year from 1988 to 2013, all fledglings were ringed and resighted as
11
12 95 breeders (with clutch or brood) in the course of systematic censuses every 3 – 6 days
13
14 96 during five months (February – July) in a fixed study area (26,889 m2) [30]. We based
15
16 97 our analyses exclusively on resightings during two months (April – May) to meet the
17
18
19 98 assumption of capture–recapture analyses that the time spanned between capture
20
21 99 occasions (e.g., 12 months) must be substantially longer than the duration of the
22
23 100 capture events (e.g., 2 months) [36]. During April – May, a representative sample of
24
25 101 fledglings that are ringed and recorded as breeders annually can be obtained [37].
26
27
102 Our initial sample consisted of 8,541 fledglings from 15 cohorts (1988 – 2009
28
29
30 103 except 1990, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 2003 and 2005 from which no chicks fledged or
31
32 104 when no fledglings were banded). For this initial sample, we scored recruitment (i.e.,
33
34 105 whether an individual fledgling was resighted in the natal colony with a partner and
35
36 106 clutch during the first six years of life or never resighted again; 1 – 0 variable). Sex of
37
38
39 107 fledglings was unknown. From this initial sample, we obtained a second sample
40
41 108 including individual capture-recapture histories of 1,310 fledglings (687 males and
42
43 109 623 females) that recruited at ages 2 – 6 years. These 1,310 individuals were sexed by
44
45 110 voice when they recruited (females grunt, males whistle) and accounted for 75.68 %
46
47
111 of recruits. We used this second sample to test whether El Niño-related conditions
48
49
50 112 experienced in the natal year negatively affect adult survival.
51
52 113 In our second sample, average (±SE) recruiting ages were 4.77 ± 0.04 and
53
54 114 4.51 ± 0.05 years for males and females, respectively. Fledglings that were recorded
55
56 115 as breeders for the first time either at age 1 year (n = 8) or 7 – 16 years (n = 412) were

3 116 excluded from the analysis in order to reduce bias in demographic estimates: most 1
4
5 117 year old recruits were recorded as breeders only once in 26 years, making it
6
7
118 impossible to attribute their early disappearance to either mortality or emigration;
8
9
10 119 whereas 7 – 16 years old recruits may have bred earlier in life but escaped sampling
11
12 120 [31]. Estimation of recruitment and survival probabilities in this colony may suffer
13
14 121 from little bias associated with temporal emigration [28,31] because Isla Isabel
15
16 122 boobies rarely disperse from their natal colony [38] and are permanently faithful to
17
18
19 123 their first breeding sites [39].
20
21 124 Oceanographic conditions experienced by boobies in early life were indexed
22
23 125 by the average sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA, °C) in the waters surrounding
24
25 126 Isla Isabel during the natal calendar year. Positive values of SSTA denote warm El
26
27
127 Niño conditions and potential reductions in food quality and quantity; negative values
28
29
30 128 denote cold La Niña conditions [27,40]. We obtained monthly average values of
31
32 129 SSTA at 21.5° N, 105.5° W (55 km southeast of Isla Isabel, the closest station) from
33
34 130 the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (http://iri.columbia.edu

42
43 134 Recruitment analysis
44
45 135 We tested whether recruitment probabilities of booby fledglings (n = 8,541) are
46
47
136 associated with the average SSTA they experienced in their natal years using
48
49
50 137 generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) with binomial error distribution and a
51
52 138 logit link function. We fitted four competing models to our data, including an
53
54 139 intercept-only model (i.e., null model), a model considering fledglings’ recruitment
55
56 140 probabilities as a function of the number of years of monitoring, a model considering

3 141 the potential impact of SSTA during the natal year (SSTAn) on fledglings’
4
5 142 recruitment probabilities, and a model considering both the number of years of
6
7
143 monitoring and SSTAn as covariates. In all these models, we included cohort as a
8
9
10 144 random effect to account for unmeasured environmental conditions in the natal years
11
12 145 (e.g., parasitism or population density).
13
14 146 We selected the model with the best fit to our data using the Akaike
15
16 147 information criterion adjusted for small sample sizes (AICc); the best fit was given by
17
18
19 148 the model with the lowest AICc score. A difference between any particular model i
20
21 149 and the best-fitting model larger than 2 units in their AICc scores (<U+2206>i > 2) was
22
23 150 considered as a real difference in their fit to the data [41]. To reduce uncertainty in the
24
25 151 process of model selection, we calculated Akaike weights (wi) as estimates of the
26
27
152 relative support for each competing model and used a multi-model averaging
28
29
30 153 approach [42] for a subset of the best-fitting models which, together, had a
31
32 154 cumulative wi of ~0.95. These models were fitted using R (Version 3.1.3 [43]).
33
34 155
35
36 156 Capture-recapture analysis
37
38
39 157 To test whether SSTA experienced in the natal year influences adult survival we used
40
41 158 a capture-recapture analysis. We analysed the 26-year mark-recapture data by means
42
43 159 of age models [44] implemented in program MARK [45]. Individuals were classified
44
45 160 into 14 age classes. The first age class included fledglings as well as one-, two-, and
46
47
161 three-year-old individuals. We pooled these ages into a single category because we
48
49
50 162 focused our capture-recapture analysis on adult individuals and a large proportion of
51
52 163 three-year-old or younger individuals were not reproductive (the average recruiting
53
54 164 age in our sample is 4.77 years for males and 4.51 years for females [46]). The next
55
56 165 12 age categories consisted of individuals from four to 15 years old, with each of
57
58
59
60 7
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 8 of 37
1
2
3 166 these ages constituting one separate age class. Finally, in the last age class we
4
5 167 included all individuals that were 16 years or older because sample sizes for each of
6
7
168 these ages were too small to allow for age-specific parameter estimation. We used a
8
9
10 169 maximum-likelihood procedure and a multi-model inference framework to estimate
11
12 170 two parameters: apparent survival (f) and recapture rate (p), as well as to assess
13
14 171 whether natal conditions (estimated as the SSTA during the natal year) affect survival
15
16 172 during adulthood.
17
18
19 173 To avoid fitting an unnecessarily large number of models to our data, we
20
21 174 searched first for the best parameterisation for the recapture rate (p) following the
22
23 175 procedure recommended by Lebreton et al. [44] and Doherty et al. [47]. This
24
25 176 procedure consisted in testing different sources of variation for p (sex, year, and their
26
27
177 additive and interactive effects) while maintaining the survival parameter varying
28
29
30 178 across years, age categories, and sexes. We did not test for differences in p among age
31
32 179 categories to avoid increasing the total number of parameters to be estimated from our
33
34 180 data. Thus, we assumed that most of the variation in recapture probability was caused
35
36 181 by differences among years in the number of adult birds that were resighted rather
37
38
39 182 than by differences in p among birds of different ages. Two of these models that
40
41 183 examined variation in p had strong support in our data. The top model included only
42
43 184 the effect of year, whereas the second model included an additive effect of year and
44
45 185 sex. These two models had similar support in our data (<U+2206>AICc = 1.4). However, since
46
47
48 186 adding the effect of sex did not substantially improve model fit, in all the competing
49
50 187 models described below we used interannual variation in p without distinguishing
51
52 188 between males and females. Estimates of these recapture parameters can be found in
53
54 189 figure S1 (Supporting Information).

3 190 We built competing linear models in MARK to test the potential impact of
4
5 191 SSTA during the natal year (SSTAn) on the survival probabilities of adults of all age
6
7
192 categories. In addition, we considered the possibility that a potential interaction
8
9
10 193 between natal (SSTAn) and current conditions (SSTA during the current year =
11
12 194 SSTAc) affected adult survival. In all cases, we tested these hypotheses considering
13
14 195 potential differences between sexes and age categories. Thus, we considered models
15
16 196 in which f varies as a function of age, sex, SSTAn, SSTAc, and additive and
17
18
19 197 interactive effects of all these variables. In total, we fitted 27 competing models to our
20
21 198 mark-recapture data, including an intercept-only model (i.e., a null model). Given that
22
23 199 in this analysis we only considered individuals that we recaptured as recruits at least
24
25 200 once (i.e., adult birds), we set the survival rate of the first age category (fledglings and
26
27
201 individuals younger than four years) as equal to one in all models. To select the model
28
29
30 202 with the greatest fit to our mark-recapture data we used AICc. We also calculated
31
32 203 Akaike weights as estimates of the relative support for each model.
33
34 204 We built one additional model that represented overall variation among years
35
36 205 in the survival rate of the different age classes. This ‘reference’ model included the
37
38
39 206 interaction between year and age affecting f and, as in all previous models, an effect
40
41 207 of year on p. Given that climatic covariates usually cannot account for all the
42
43 208 interannual variation in demographic parameters (as estimated by our reference
44
45 209 model), we used the F statistic proposed by Grosbois et al. [48] to test whether the
46
47
210 particular combination of explanatory variables selected by AICc accounted for a
48
49
50 211 statistically significant proportion of the observed interannual variation in the survival
51
52 212 of all the different age categories. In addition, we calculated the fraction of the
53
54 213 temporal variation in the survival of all age classes (as estimated again by our
55
56 214 reference model) that can be explained by the climatic covariates selected by AICc.

3 215 For this purpose, we used a measure of effect size based on the proportion of deviance
4
5 216 explained by our most supported model (R2_Dev [48]). This is equivalent to a
6
7
217 coefficient of determination and quantifies the importance of climatic covariates in
8
9
10 218 promoting temporal variation in f. An R2_Dev > 0.2 indicates that the explanatory
11
12 219 variables selected by AICc can indeed be considered as influential.

19 222 Fledglings’ probability of recruiting
20
21 223 The SSTA experienced by fledglings in their natal years predicted their probability of
22
23 224 recruiting: the model including both the SSTAn and the number of years of
24
25
26 225 monitoring was the top-ranked model and had 73% of relative support in our data
27
28 226 (table 1). Moreover, the model including the SSTAn as the only predictor of
29
30 227 recruitment was the second best-fitting model and had 21% of relative support,
31
32 228 although this model differed in 2.54 AICc units from the top-ranked model (table 1).

37 230 only predictor differed in more than five and eight AICc units from the top-ranked
38
39 231 model, respectively, and hence, had weaker support in our data (w = 0.05 and 0.01,
40
41 232 respectively; table 1). We used the two best-fitting models for the model averaging
42
43 233 procedure. The SSTAn was the predictor with the highest relative importance (0.94 vs
44
45
46 234 0.78 for the number of years of monitoring). The probability of recruiting varied as a
47
48 235 negative function of SSTAn (estimate ± SE: -1.036 ± 0.435). Each additional degree
49
50 236 (°C) of water temperature in the natal year meant a reduction of roughly 50% in
51
52 237 fledglings’ probability of returning to the colony as adult breeders (figure 1).

3 240 A single model had strong support in our data (w = 0.99; table 2). This top-ranked
4
5 241 model included an interaction between age and SSTAc affecting f. The effect of the
6
7
242 natal conditions (SSTAn) was included in the second top-ranked model (table 2).
8
9
10 243 However, this second model differed in more than 20 AICc units from the top model
11
12 244 and, hence, had virtually no support (w < 0.001). The first model that included an
13
14 245 effect of sex on f had no support either (<U+2206>AICc = 24.7, w < 0.001).
15
16
246 Using our dataset, we were able to accurately estimate annual survival rates
17
18
19 247 (estimated from our reference model) and the expected relationship between SSTAc
20
21 248 and survival (estimated from our best-fitting model) for six age classes (figure 2). No
22
23 249 other parameters were properly estimated because their standard errors were too large.
24
25 250 According to our best-fitting model, the impact of sea temperature in the current year
26
27
28 251 on annual survival rates of booby adults varied among ages (figure 2). The strongest
29
30 252 negative impact occurred in the two oldest age classes. In 15-year-old individuals,
31
32 253 survival decreased on average from 0.97 in years when SSTAc was approximately
33
34 254 -0.24 °C to 0.47 in years when SSTAc was approximately +0.76 °C (i.e., a 52%
35
36
37
255 decrease in survival probability). Similarly, in the oldest individuals (= 16 years)
38
39 256 survival decreased on average from 0.92 in years when SSTAc was approximately
40
41 257 -0.24 °C to 0.37 in years when SSTAc was approximately +0.76 °C (i.e., a 60%
42
43 258 decrease in survival probability; figure 2).
44
45 259 In contrast, younger individuals experienced less drastic changes in survival in
46
47
48 260 response to increases in sea surface temperature (figure 2). According to predictions
49
50 261 from our best-fitting model, survival of six-year-old birds decreased on average 26%
51
52 262 from the coldest to the warmest year (from 0.78 to 0.58). In five-, ten-, and eleven-
53
54 263 year-old birds, survival increased on average 13% (from 0.86 to 0.97), 26% (from
55
56
57
264 0.66 to 0.83), and 9% (from 0.78 to 0.85), respectively, from the coldest to the

5 266 significant (F25,169 = 20.4, P < 0.001) and explained a large amount (75%) of the total
6

11
12 269 5. Discussion
13
14
270 This study of the blue-footed booby provides two main results. First, recruitment
15
16
17 271 probability of fledglings declines with increase in sea temperature during their natal
18
19 272 years. Second, adult survival over the age-span of the species is not affected by warm
20
21 273 sea temperature during the natal year.
22
23 274 On average, an extra 1.0 °C in the natal year meant a reduction of roughly
24
25
26 275 50% in fledglings’ recruiting probabilities. This result may be due to reduced
27
28 276 physiological condition of birds born in stressful (warm) years [29,49]. Warming of
29
30 277 surface waters associated with El Niño depletes ocean productivity [26,40], with
31
32 278 consequent reductions in food quality and quantity for seabirds [27,50]. Boobies born
33
34
279 in El Niño years fledge with a low body mass [25,29], and poor body condition at
35
36
37 280 fledging may compromise marine birds’ survival and transition into the breeding
38
39 281 stage [23,51]. Recruiting demands considerable energy [52,53] because it involves
40
41 282 sexual maturation, mate acquisition, and territory defense [54]. Individuals stressed by
42
43 283 natal El Niño conditions may be less competitive in these domains and consequently
44
45
46 284 less likely to pair and establish a clutch [2,10].
47
48 285 An earlier analysis of individual life histories showed that boobies born in
49
50 286 warm El Niño years recruit at a younger age, space their breeding events more widely
51
52 287 (i.e., skip more breeding events [34]) and, during the first 10 years at least, achieve
53
54
55
288 similar annual breeding success and total breeding success to boobies born in cool-
56
57 289 water years, despite breeding less frequently than the latter [25]. Our results further
58
59
60 12
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 13 of 37 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 290 reveal that for boobies born in warm years, probability of recruitment is low but
4
5 291 annual survival is undiminished, even at old ages. Thus, we show that when boobies
6
7
292 buffer against harsh natal conditions by making life history adjustments [25] they pay
8
9
10 293 no survival penalty, although an analysis of lifetime reproductive success is still
11
12 294 needed. Lack of effect of El Niño-related stresses in the natal year on adult survival
13
14 295 also suggests that low-quality fledglings from warm-water years are winnowed out of
15
16 296 the population before obtaining breeding status, and this early disappearance may lead
17
18
19 297 to low heterogeneity in the quality of recruits [19,55].
20
21 298 The impact of El Niño conditions in the current breeding year on adult
22
23 299 survival varies among age categories, with oldest adults (=15 years) being the most
24
25 300 affected by warm waters. For them, substantial warming (~0.76°C above the
26
27
301 historical mean) implies a reduction of ~50-60% in probability of survival. In
28
29
30 302 contrast, survival of younger adults shows minimal effects across the whole range of
31
32 303 water temperatures. These age-dependent impacts of current El Niño conditions on
33
34 304 adult survival may reflect increasing vulnerability to environmental challenges at
35
36 305 more advanced ages [56, but see 57] due, for example, to a deterioration in foraging
37
38
39 306 performance with age [58]. Nevertheless, further studies in wild populations that
40
41 307 estimate to what extent illness or physical decay increase vulnerability to inclement
42
43 308 weather at advanced ages are still needed [57,58].
44
45 309 Our analyses revealed age-dependent impacts of El Niño on adult survival that
46
47
310 differ from those reported by an earlier mark-recapture study based on multistate
48
49
50 311 modeling [28]. The previous study suggested that current El Niño conditions
51
52 312 negatively affect youngest adults’ survival, whereas oldest boobies’ survival is largely
53
54 313 independent of variation in sea water temperature [28]. This inconsistency is likely
55
56 314 because the previous study pooled age classes 7 – 16 years into a single category [28],

3 315 whereas our current analysis included a greater number of advanced age classes,
4
5 316 providing a better resolution of survival probabilities at older ages and increasing the
6
7
317 probability of detecting an effect of SSTAc on survival of the oldest boobies.

12 319 6. Conclusion
13
14
320 This study contributes to our still limited knowledge of how early-life environments
15
16
17 321 influence vital rates in nature [10,19,23], and provides important insights into the
18
19 322 long-term fitness consequences arising from effects of El Niño on early development.
20
21 323 Our results also have conservation implications: although developmental adjustments
22
23 324 associated with natal El Niño conditions [25] incur no survival penalty late in life,
24
25
26 325 harsh natal conditions reduce recruitment prospects of developing offspring, which
27
28 326 may entail subsequent reductions in population growth [14,19,26,31].

3 Dear editors,

6 We are very grateful for the comments made by you and the reviewers. Please find attached our
7 carefully revised MS.
8
9 We have implemented the analytical change suggested by reviewer 2: we now use true age
10 models to test whether El Niño conditions experienced in the natal year influence annual survival
11 probabilities of adult boobies at different ages. This new approach does not allow us to test
12
simultaneously whether El Niño conditions in the natal year predict fledglings’ probability of
13
14 recruiting because age models are based on adults, exclusively. Therefore we examined impacts of
15 El Niño on recruitment by testing logistic Generalised Linear Mixed Models in R. Importantly, the
16 main patterns in the results did not change from our original submission: experiencing El Niño
17 conditions during early life reduces recruiting probabilities but not adult survival.
18
19 We have implemented all other minor corrections and clarifications requested by you and the two
20
21 reviewers. We hope you will find our responses to your requested changes satisfactory. We look
22 forward to hearing from you.
23
24 With regards,

34 This paper does not present any actual data. I would expect to see real figures on survival of
35
36
fledglings to breeding age by El Nino vs La Nina years, since that is your main topic. Then see
37 figures on adult survival, and older adult survival. The paper, as it stands, is not useful to anyone
38 studying survival because of the lack of any data.
39
40 Our response: We now display actual data in our figures.

45 Comments to the Author(s)
46 This manuscript reports an original analysis of delayed effects of early life conditions on
47 reproductive and survival performance during adulthood in a seabird, the blue-footed booby.
48 From a very high quality data set (> 8000 known-aged birds monitored for 26 years), the authors
49 found that being born in years with warm water leads to decrease recruitment but does not
50
influence survival later in life and that warm water during a given year negatively influences prime-
51
52 age adult survival in that year. These results are potentially important and are likely to attract a
53 broad range of readers. However, I found a major flaw in the CMR analysis that needs to be
54 solved.
55
56 The multi-state CMR modelling (with age included as a state) as performed here is not appropriate
57 because, by definition, not all individuals in a given age group will have the same probability to
58

1
2
3 transit to the next age group. For instance, within the mature adults, all the 7 years-old birds but
4
none of the 6 years-old bird will transit to the senescent stage (psiMS parameter here). This
5
6 problem has been addressed thoroughly by Mollet & Cailliet (Mar. Freshwater Res. 2002). It is
7 therefore required to fit truly age-dependent CMR models. This would allow the authors to assess
8 the influence of early life conditions on reproductive and actuarial senescence (see e.g. Nussey et
9 al. 2007 Curr Biol. for a case study on red deer). Moreover, it would be more appropriate to
10 include individual birds when they come to breed for the first time in the analysis. This would
11 allow avoiding the fixed capture probability to 0 for fledging and the heterogenity in capture
12
probability at later ages in relation to the breeding status, which could explain the strange
13
14 resighting patterns displayed in the supplementary figures.
15
16 Our response: As suggested, we have fitted age-dependent CMR models to capture-recapture
17 histories of adult boobies (i.e., individuals recorded with a partner and a clutch), exclusively.
18
19 In addition, the following minor problems have to be solved:
20
21
22 l. 18-19 and 48-49 and 56-57: Partly true only. See e.g. Nussey et al. 2007 Curr Biol or Garratt et al.
23 2015 Curr Biol for case studies addressing that question.
24
25 Our response: We have adjusted these assertions and included the suggested references (lines
26 18-19, 49-50, and 57-58).
27
28
29 l. 51: "important" instead of "significant"
30
31 Our response: We have replaced “significant” with “important”, as suggested (line 52).
32
33 l. 57-59: Well, this is a bit overstated. Lemaitre et al. (2015 PRSB) recently reviewed evidence for
34 costs of early allocation to reproduction in terms of senescence in vertebrates.
35
36
37 Our response: We have moderated this statement. Now we say that “the general expectation
38 that natural selection favors costs being expressed late in life (when expression is less likely)
39 needs to be evaluated more extensively in natural populations”, and cite the suggested
40 reference (lines 57-60).
41
42
l. 162-169: This part can be reduced markedly. While the conclusion is right, there is no need to
43
44 discuss the effect of SST on fledging survival because this model is not competitive (more
45 parameters and higher AIC value).
46
47 Our response: This section no longer exists in our revised paper.
48
49 l. 177: "statistically significant" instead of "significant"
50
51
52 Our response: This section no longer exists in our revised paper.

18 Additional comments by editors/reviewers on the submitted PDF
19
20
21 Line 20: should use the name of the bird here. Don't keep people guessing.
22
23 Our response: We now provide the name of the study species earlier in the summary (line 20), as
24 requested.
25
26 Line 21: ENSO actually refers to the whole cycle, the warm event of El Nino and the cold
27
event of La Nina. So it is most correct to refer to El Nino if you are only talking about the warm
28
29 event.
30
31 Our response: We have modified this sentence as suggested (line 22), and now we use “El Niño”
32 throughout the paper to refer to the warm phase of the cycle.
33
34 Line 32: Throughout the paper you refer to survival rates increasing or decreasing but you don't
35
36
give any of the rates, or the tests of the significance of the changes in them. You need to present
37 the data. You also talk about fledgling production (generally called reproductive success) so you
38 need to give the actual data you are talking about. Without the data, the paper becomes a
39 generalization, as you might find in a popular paper.
40
41 Our response: In the previous version of our paper, we provided the p value for the interaction
42
between SSTA in the current year and age, and indicated that this interaction explained 11% of
43
44 total interannual variation in adult survival. See line 186 in the first version of the MS. In our
45 revised paper, we have removed this result because we have changed our modelling (i.e., we
46 now use age-models instead of multistate models) as suggested by Prof J-M Gaillard, and along
47 with the new results, we provide actual data on adult survival probabilities in “Results” section
48 (lines 252-265) and in figure 1.
49
50
Data on fledgling production are not needed in this study focused on the impacts of El Niño
51
52 conditions in the natal year on fledglings’ probability of recruiting and on adult survival. In the
53 summary, we mention that “a previous study showed that early recruitment and widely spaced
54 breeding allow boobies born in El Niño years to achieve normal fledgling production over the
55 first 10 years”. Here there is no need to repeat an analysis that is already published (Ancona S,
56 Drummond H (2013) PLoS ONE 8(9): e72665).

3 Line 93: Remove “systematically” from here.

5
6 Our response: We have removed “systematically” from this sentence (line 94)
7
8 Line 179: do you mean to say on 'adult survival in the following years"?
9
10 Our response: We mean annual survival rates of 4 – 23 year old adults. In order to make this
11 more clear, we have modified this sentence as follows “According to our best-fitting model, the
12
impact of sea temperature in the current year on annual survival rates of booby adults varied
13
14 among ages” (lines 250-251).
15
16 Line 181: why don't you give the actual survival figure here? Like .98 or whatever it is. The paper
17 seems to have no data in it - more like it was written for something like Audubon magazine.
18
19 Our response: In our revised paper, we provide data on actual changes in adult survival
20
21 associated with variation in the SSTA during the current year (lines 252-265).
22
23 Line 196: do you mean it's not "affected by".
24
25 Our response: We have modified this sentence as requested (line 272).
26
27
Lines 202-205: but if they didn't recruit to the colony, they didn't have the excess energy drain of
28
29 courting and defending a territory. If they were there courting, you would have recaptured them.
30
31 Our response: Probability of recruiting in our study reflects this process too as we only recapture
32 boobies that are recorded with a partner and a clutch in the colony. We specified this in Methods
33 (lines 94-95).
34
35
36
Lines 207-210: How can they fledge as many chicks if they space their breeding out more widely?
37
38 Our response: Boobies born during El Niño years take more sabbaticals, but during the first 10
39 years at least, fledge as many chicks as boobies born in cool-water years, essentially because
40 their breeding attempts are successful during this 10-year period (Ancona S, Drummond H (2013)
41 PLoS ONE 8(9): e72665). We have added this explanation to make this statement more clear
42
(lines 285-289).
43
44
45 Line 208: do you mean here that they didn't breed every year? Need to say what this means -
46 space breeding more widely
47
48 Our response: We now specify that “spacing their breeding events more widely” means skipping
49 more breeding attempts, and we have added a supporting reference (line 287).
50
51
52 Line 213: "Delayed survival" doesn't have any meaning. You mean survival as they age. But you
53 can just eliminate the one word here and it's fine.
54
55 Our response: We have removed “delayed” from this sentence, as requested (lines 292-293).

7 Our response: This sentence no longer exists in our revised paper.
8
9 Lines 217-219: This makes total sense to me. these birds breed every year for the most part -
10 whether it's an El Nino or La Nina. No reason to expect that being hatched in 1 event would make
11 you breed only in those years in the future. Probably not worth mentioning
12
13
14 Our response: This section on the Predictive Adaptive Response hypothesis no longer exists in
15 our revised MS.
16
17 Lines 225-241: Personally, I'd leave this paragraph out.
18
19 Our response: We kept a shortened/simplified version of this paragraph in our revised MS (lines
20
21 298-308) just to offer an explanation for this peripheral result, but we may remove it if you
22 consider it unnecessary.
23
24 Lines 228-230: You need to give the actual figures here on survival of the age group - like
25 (decreased from .98 to .52). It carries no weight if you don't present the data.
26
27
Our response: In our revised MS we present these figures (lines 252-265 and 298-308).
28
29
30 Line 234: Definition of senescent that you are using? Often used for no longer breeding birds and
31 if that is the case, there is no reproductive trade-off.
32
33 Our response: This categorisation no longer exists in our revised MS as we changed our
34 modelling as suggested by Prof Gaillard.
35
36
37 Lines 235-236: Birds don't "take advantage" of their potential, as if they thought about it. They do
38 what they are driven to do. If they can catch enough food to get in to breeding condition, they
39 breed. I would re-word this to be more accurate.
40
41 Our response: We were not talking about intention here; we regret this was not clear enough.
42
Anyway, due to analytical changes suggested by J-M Gaillard, this discussion no longer exists in
43
44 our revised MS.
45
46 Line 239: Why is it expected to be restrained? Do you have a reason?
47
48 Our response: This section no longer exists in our revised MS. The eliminated statement is based
49 on a theoretical study (McNamara, J. M. et al. (2009) Proc. R. Soc. London B Biol. Sci. 276, 4061–
50
4066.) showing that older individuals may refrain from terminal investment, thereby extending
51
52 their reproductive lifespan and increasing their fitness.
53
54 Lines 242-243: Give the comparison figures here, and some idea of significance levels.

3 Line 251: Change: “survival of different age classes of birds” instead of “vital rates”
4

6 Our response: We prefer to leave the original sentence as it stands because our study contributes
7 to understanding how early-life environments influence both recruitment and survival in wild
8 populations (line 320-321).
9
10 Line 252: Change: “the effects of an El Niño event on fledging birds” instead of “developmental
11 effects of ENSO”.
12
13
14 Our response: We have modified this sentence as follows: “This study contributes to our still
15 limited knowledge of how early-life environments influence vital rates in nature, and provides
16 important insights into the long-term fitness consequences arising from effects of El Niño on
17 early development (line 320-322).
18
19 Line 254: Change: “birds fledging in the year the unusual environmental conditions occur” instead
20
21 of “newborns”.
22
23 Our response: We have modified this sentence as follows: “harsh natal conditions reduce
24 recruitment prospects of developing offspring” (line 325). This change may be more appropriate
25 as El Niño conditions are common enough to be considered usual.

Appendix D
Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Excellent paper based on an incredible long term dataset. Dr. Drummond and his students
have established a rare dataset on a long-lived species that is providing new and important
insights into the birds' biology, and the biology of of all seabird species. Data are well
presented, discussions are clear. I made 3 minor comments on word usage - suggesting a
better word, more to the meaning intended by the authors.
Reviewer 1’s comment 1. Lines 274-284. Many fledglings are unable to survive their first
year when they fledge underweight. Most of the loss probably happens well before they try
to return and start breeding. I doubt that fledging underweight is still affecting them at age
3-5 when they return to the colony to try to breed.
***OUR RESPONSE*** Male and female boobies that experience warm water El Niño
conditions in their natal years are underweight at fledging, recruit earlier and bred less
frequently than boobies born in cool-water years (Ancona & Drummond, 2013, PLoS ONE 8:
e72665), suggesting that fledging underweight associated with natal El Niño conditions is
still affecting boobies at age 2-6, when they return to the colony to try to breed. Thus, it
seems reasonable to hypothesise that fledging underweight may compromise adults’
competitive abilities and probabilities of acquiring a pair and establishing a clutch.
In our revised text, we have modified this statement as follows in order to make it clearer
(lines 284-295):
“… Boobies born in El Niño years fledge with a low body mass [25,29], and poor body
condition at fledging may compromise marine birds’ survival and transition into the
breeding stage [23,50]. Nonetheless, a number of booby fledglings born in El Niño years
manage to recruit despite being underweight, and if so, they recruit earlier and bred less
frequently than fledglings born in cool-water years [25]. This probably implies that fledging
underweight associated with natal El Niño conditions is still affecting boobies at age 2 – 6,
when they return to the colony to try to breed. Recruiting demands considerable energy
[51,52] because it involves sexual maturation, mate acquisition, and territory defense [53].
Individuals stressed by natal El Niño conditions may be less competitive in these domains
and consequently less likely to pair and lay [2,10]…”
Reviewer 1’s comment 2. Line 291. Is this annual "adult" survival?
***OUR RESPONSE*** Yes, we referred to annual adult survival. We have modified this
sentence as suggested (line 302).
Reviewer 1’s comment 3. Line 301. It doesn't "imply" it produces or results in a reduction....
***OUR RESPONSE*** We have replaced “implies” by “results in”, as suggested (line 312).
Reviewer 1’s comment 4. Lines 307-308. An El Nino is much more than "inclement"
(meaning unpleasantly cold or wet) weather. Probably should say something like "severe" or
"unusual".
***OUR RESPONSE*** We have replaced “inclement” by “severe”, as requested (line 318).
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
Reviewer 2’s comment 1a. This revised version has much improved. However, I still have
concern about the CMR analysis of adult survival as currently performed. The authors
collected an exceptionally high quality dataset corresponding to 26 years of CMR data. The
first step is thus to fit a fully age-dependent model and then try to reduce the number of
parameters (only 23 will be identifiable from the full age-dependent model if the longest
bird reached 23 years at the most). The authors need to check that their 14 age-class models
provides a reliable picture of the full age-dependence.
***OUR RESPONSE*** As requested, we have implemented a full age-dependent model in
which we estimated a different survival rate for adult individuals of all age classes (including
individuals between 16 and 23 years old). This full age-dependent model had poor support
in our data. We conclude: (1) that our model with 14 age classes provides an adequate
description of the variation in adult survival rates, and (2) that there is little evidence of
differences in the age-specific survival of individuals between 16 and 23 years old. In our
revised text, we now explain this as follows (lines 168-173):
“…These 14 age classes adequately describe the variation in the survival rates of our colony
of blue-footed boobies because the full age-dependent model, in which we estimated
different age-specific survival probabilities for individuals of ages 16-23, had notably weaker
support in our data (<U+F044>AICc = 11.3 with respect to our model with 14 age classes). This result
indicates little evidence of statistical differences in the survival rates of individuals between
16 and 23 years old…”
Reviewer 2’s comment 1b. Moreover, some biological justification has to be provided for
fitting this 14 age-class model.
***OUR RESPONSE*** We provide two biological justifications for fitting this 14 age-class
model. First, we explain why we pooled fledglings as well as one-, two-, and three-year-old
individuals into a single (pre-adult) category in lines 161-164: “We pooled these ages into a
single (pre-adult) category because we focused our capture-recapture analysis on adults,
and most Isla Isabel boobies can be considered as reproductively mature adults from age
four, the average age of first breeding”. Second, after saying that we found no evidence of
statistical differences in the survival rates of individuals between 16 and 23 years old, we
mention that this result is also supported by a general decline in the number of breeding
individuals after age 16 years, and provide a relevant reference for this statement (lines 174-
175).
Reviewer 2’s comment 1c. The authors should also considered continuous age-dependent
models that usually provide good fit to age-specific survival (e.g. Gompertz model or Weibull
models). It is really crucial for readers to know more about age-dependence and the
graphical display of the full age-dependent model should be provided.
***OUR RESPONSE*** Gompertz and Weibull models provide an alternative way of
displaying our findings but these alternative approaches are not the only legitimate and
useful way to describe actuarial senescence. The age-dependent models we used to analyse
our mark-recapture data also account adequately for the influence of age differences on
survival or encounter probabilities, and thus provide a good fit to age-specific survival
(Pradel et al.,1997, Biometrics, 53, 60-72). These CMR models are widely used in the
literature and have gained general acceptance for providing reliable descriptions of how
age-specific survival is influenced by its proposed predictors (RS McCrea & BJT Morgan,
2014, Analysis of Capture-Recapture Data. Chapman & Hall/CRC Press. Boca Raton, FL, USA).
Therefore, our age-dependent models are adequate and robust analytical tools for testing
the hypothesis that El Niño conditions experienced in the natal year impact survival over the
adult lifetime. Furthermore, along with statistical and biological justification for fitting our
14 age-class model, we provided a graphical display of the age-specific survival estimates
yielded by this model.
Please note that the age-dependent models reported in our revised manuscript
were fitted following the reviewer´s suggestion in the first round of evaluation (which made
no mention of continuous age-dependent models).
Reviewer 2’s comment 1d. From this basis, it should be easier for readers to understand
whether the authors’s interpretation that pooling ages from 7 to 16 in previous studies
caused the difference in results with the present work.
***OUR RESPONSE*** Our current Discussion makes clear to the reader that the
inconsistency between our results and those published by Oro et al. (2010) with respect to
the effects of current El Niño conditions on adult survival was caused by their pooling of
ages 7-16 into a single category. (Lines 320-329 say):
“… Our analyses revealed age-dependent impacts of El Niño on adult survival that differ
from those reported by an earlier mark-recapture study based on multistate modeling [28].
The previous study suggested that current El Niño conditions negatively affect survival of the
youngest adults, whereas survival of the oldest boobies is largely independent of variation in
sea water temperature [28]. This inconsistency probably arises because the previous study
pooled age classes 7 – 16 years into a single category [28] whereas our current analysis
included a greater number of advanced age classes, thus providing a better resolution of
survival probabilities at older ages and increasing the probability of detecting an effect of
SSTAc on survival of the oldest boobies…”
In addition, the following points need to be fixed:
Reviewer 2’s comment 2. l. 50: « start » instead of « starts »
***Our response*** We have replaced “starts” by “start”, as suggested (line 50).
Reviewer 2’s comment 3. l. 159: « age-dependent models » instead of « age models »
***OUR RESPONSE*** We have replaced “age models” by “age-dependent models”, as
suggested (line 159).
Reviewer 2’s comment 4. l. 160-161: Where is the evidence that no survival difference
occurred among fledglings, 1-, 2 -and 3-year-olds? I certainly agree that birds were not
reproductive at these ages, but marked differences in survival might occur independently of
the reproductive status.
***OUR RESPONSE*** Certainly, asking for differences in age-specific survival among
individuals from the youngest age classes (i.e. fledglings, one-, two-, and three-year-old
individuals) is an interesting question. However, we should recall here that our capture-
mark-recapture (CMR) analysis focuses exclusively on adult boobies (individuals older than
three years) and does so because one of the main objectives of our study was to test for an
effect of natal conditions on adult survival (not on juvenile survival). In addition, we focused
exclusively on adult survival because this is exactly what this reviewer requested in his first
round of comments:
“…it would be more appropriate to include individual birds when they come to breed for the
first time in the analysis…”
Therefore, given that we included only adult individuals in our CMR analysis (i.e. individuals
that certainly returned to the colony as breeders), all these individuals survived all the way
from fledgling to the average recruiting age (four years). Hence, we set the survival rate of
the first age class (fledglings, one-, two-, and three-year-old individuals pooled together) as
equal to one. Thus, in our dataset there is no way to test for differences in survival among
fledglings, one-, two- and three-year-olds because all of them survived to adulthood. We
have carefully explained all this in lines 160-164 and 204-207 of our manuscript:
“…The first age class included fledglings as well as one-, two-, and three-year-old individuals.
We pooled these ages into a single (pre-adult) category because we focused our capture-
recapture on adults, and most Isla Isabel boobies can be considered as reproductively
mature adults from age four, the average age of first breeding…”
“…Given that this analysis only embraced individuals recaptured as recruits at least once
(i.e., adults), we set the survival rate of the first age category (fledglings and individuals
younger than four years) as equal to one in all models…”
Reviewer 2’s comment 5. l. 166-168: From my experience with fitting CMR models to study
actuarial senescence, this statement is not true. I certainly agree that the confidence
intervals of age-specific survival beyond 15 years of age will be quite large, there is no a
priori reason to pool these ages within a same class. Show first evidence that there is little
difference in survival between 16 and older ages.
***OUR RESPONSE*** In our revised manuscript, we provide evidence of no statistical
differences in the age-specific survival of individuals between 16 and 23 years old. Please
see above our response to Reviewer 2’s comment 1a.
Reviewer 2’s comment 6. l. 191-192: Alternatively, you could test an influence of SSTA on
the parameters of a continuous function of age-dependence (e.g. intercept that corresponds
to the baseline survival and slope that corresponds to the aging rate in a Gompertz model).
***OUR RESPONSE*** True, but the alternative age-dependent models we used also
account for differences in the ages of individuals that may influence their survival or
encounter probabilities, and therefore provide good fit to age-specific survival and a reliable
description of how it is influenced by SSTA. Please see above our response to Reviewer 2’s
comment 1c.
Reviewer 2’s comment 7. l. 272: « lifespan » instead of « age-span »
***OUR RESPONSE*** We have replaced “age-span” by “lifespan”, as suggested (line 278).
Reviewer 2’s comment 8. l. 284: « lay » instead of « establish a clutch »
***OUR RESPONSE*** We have replaced “establish a clutch” by “lay”, as suggested (line
295).

Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
I thank the authors for having considered my comments thoroughly. At this stage, I do not
think I could ask more. The MS reads well and reports a highly relevant case study. The
authors chose not to run Gompertz model, which is perfectly acceptable. My only and last
(minor) request is the requirement of a table in the Supplementary Material that will display
the full age-specific estimates of survival with SE. This information would be highly useful for
all readers interested by senescence in the wild.
J.M. Gaillard
***OUR RESPONSE***
We thank Prof J.M. Gaillard; his thoughtful comments improved the manuscript. We have
included a table in Supplementary Material (Supporting_Information_table_S1) displaying
the full age-specific estimates of survival with SE from our reference (time-varying) model
for adult blue-footed boobies, as requested. We have also included a reference for this new
supplementary table in the MS (line 253) to ensure it can be found in searches by the
reader.
