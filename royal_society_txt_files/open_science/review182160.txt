Graw et al. Present novel and interesting data on the social organization of a little-studied
mongoose species. Because mongooses, as a group, remain understudied, this report will make
an important contribution to mammalian socioecology. In addition, the existence of male
associations in slender mongooses has been reported only anecdotally. Because this aspect of
their social organization is rare among mammals, the details provided by the present ms are most
welcome for those interested in carnivore/mammalian sociality. The data set is impressive, and
the analyses make good use of this novel information. Some points require clarification and/or
re-organization, however, but they are mainly limited to the Introduction and Discussion, so that
only relatively minor revisions are necessary to make this ms acceptable for publication.
On conceptual point requiring revision is evident from the first two sentences of the abstract
already. The authors are interested in several aspects of the social system of this species, but exact
definitions and relationships among the different components remain unclear. They also interpret
their findings with respect to the level of social complexity, which is intimately related to the first
aspect. These conceptual relationships have been defined and characterized in a recent review
(Kappeler P.M. 2019 A framework for studying social complexity. Behavioral Ecology and
Sociobiology 73, 13. (doi:10.1007/s00265-018-2601-8) that was not yet published when this ms was
drafted. It may provide some structural and semantic guidance for framing their study aims and
predictions. I am, of course, not insisting that the authors follow my classification scheme, but I
think that it will help clarify their thinking and writing about social organization, social structure
and aspects of the mating system.
L. 68: male alliances were also reported for the narrow-striped mongoose (Schneider TC,
Kappeler PM (2016) Gregarious sexual segregation: the unusual social organization of the
Malagasy narrow-striped mongoose (Mungotictis decemlineata) Behavioral Ecology and
Sociobiology 70:913-926 doi:10.1007/s00265-016-2113-3).
The summary of mongoose social systems (line 79 ff) may perhaps benefit from another fairly
recent review of this topic (Schneider TC, Kappeler PM (2014) Social systems and life-history
characteristics of mongooses Biological Reviews 89:173-198 doi:10.1111/brv.12050).
The Introduction and Discussion could be better structured by inserting paragraph breaks
whenever the focus moves on to another topic (e.g. line 84 before “Here, we investigate…”); this
would enhance readability throughout the manuscript. In this context, I would also like to
propose to add subheaders to the Discussion.
L 152: it is not obvious in the Abstract that radio-tracking was limited to resting animals in
burrows. (In the Results, the authors speak of “sleeping site home ranges”). This detail should be
mentioned there, and its implications/limitations should be discussed in more detail.
L 311: the wording a/o definition is a bit awkward here: “Spatial groups consisted of 1 to 3 adult
males”. I would not call a single individual a group. This variation may actually also warrant
some additional analyses/comment: do single males differ from the groups in terms of body size,
number of (male) relatives alive or some other relevant trait?
3
L 340 The reproductive success per male association is an unusual and presumably misleading
measure because it does apparently not take variation in the number of males/members into
account. Related to the previous inquiry, it would be interesting to present (average) male
reproductive success for single males and for associations of 2 and 3 males separately.
L 477 “behaved mostly solitary” sounds awkward; “ranged” might work better as a verb here.
L 480: the “hidden complexities” appear as a prominent conclusion in the abstract, but this point
is not elaborated/discussed in the Discussion; it only appears at the end of the Conclusions.
Given the large number of still unstudied (presumably) solitary carnivores/mammals, it would
be helpful to elaborate a bit on which hidden complexities were hidden for which reason,
why/how they were brought to the foreground and what exactly the complexity part entails.
Sorry to refer to another earlier study of mine (Kappeler PM, Wimmer B, Zinner D, Tautz D
(2002) The hidden matrilineal structure of a solitary lemur: implications for primate social
evolution. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B 269:1755-1763
doi:10.1098/rspb.2002.2066), but it provides another example of this point that I find worth
emphasizing.
I am really sorry for highlighting some of my own previous papers; I hate reviews where referees
say “you should cite me here or there”, but it will hopefully be evident that these
recommendations are motivated by an attempt to make an interesting and very good paper even
a little bit better.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Alexander Ophir):
Dear Dr. Graw,
I have now received reviews of your manuscript from two experts in this field. As you can see
from their comments they were both impressed by the study you described and the significant
data set that accompanied it. Although both raised several points that you will need to address,
all these comments seem to be relatively minor and easily addressed. Please give special thought
to Reviewer 1's suggestion to use the recent Review by Kappler et al to provide additional
structure and enhance the framework within which you are discussing your study. I think this
will potentially even further broaden the appeal of your paper to a wider RSOS audience. These
points notwithstanding, congratulations on a very nice paper.

Appendix A
This study combines genetic and behavioural data to further our understanding of the social and
breeding system of the slender mongoose. I find it to be generally well-written, with the
introduction nicely setting up the background of the study, and the discussion putting the results
into context. As the authors point out, studies of mammalian species that are solitary and difficult to
habituate are rare and hence the present study provides a valuable contribution to our
understanding of mammalian social biology. I suggest some additional clarification in the methods
and results, particularly clarifying ethical aspects, sample sizes and figure 3. However, on the whole, I
think this paper is a valuable contribution to the literature.
Abstract:
L18-19: This sentence could be clearer. At the moment, it’s not entirely clear what overlaps what.
Consider splitting into two sentences, one focused on males and one on females.
Introduction: Generally very nicely written, with the background and context of the study well
explained.
L37: typo? Should this be ‘male alliance formation’
L64-65: I think that the sentence would be clearer with ‘especially in species with synchronised
estrus’ in brackets.
L83: It would make sense to include a reference for the long-term study of dwarf mongooses, since
you include references for the other two studies/species.
L95: It’s not very clear what ‘the other studies’ means. Do you mean all other published work on this
species? Perhaps rephrase to ‘Previous studies …’
Methods: Generally clear, but ethical information is missing. Could you include details of the weight
of collars as a proportion of the body weight, details on how stress was minimised during capture.
How long did captures take? How frequently were traps checked? Was any food/water provided?
Were individuals monitored after anaesthesia? Were there any adverse effects?
It would also be good if you could include an explanation of exactly how you defined spatial groups
here. I know you include a general definition in the introduction, but one more specific to your study
would help to justify your categorisations.
L141: ‘During captures’ is a little confusing. Perhaps re-phrase as ‘Over our study period, we made a
total of 215 captures, comprising 131 unique individuals…’
L144-145: ‘Whenever possible we radio-collared at least two adults in close proximity.’ is not very
clear. Could you clarify? Details of the number of individuals collared would be useful here. I assume
you didn’t collar all 131 individuals? Given that tracking details are in the following paragraph,
perhaps move this sentence to the next paragraph.
L127 (Capture procedure): No details of anaesthetic are given. I assume you anaesthetised animals
before ageing, sexing, microchipping and DNA sampling. Also, how was the tissue sample taken? E.g.
using surgical scissors/scalpel? How were infection chances minimised? Were the scissors/scalpel
sterilised? Was any antiseptic applied?
L165-166: Are there any references for this software?
L171: remove comma.
L180-182: This sentence is confusing – comma use issue?
L194: What measure of relatedness did you use, and why? There are many slightly different
measures with different benefits.
L201: ‘less’ should be ‘fewer’
Results: Some of your results could be clearer. In particular, sample sizes need clarifying, figure
legends could do with further explanation, and figure 3 is particularly confusing and could be
replaced with something more intuitive.
L212: The number of individuals you’ve included is lower than the number you report in the
methods. I assume this is because you didn’t get enough data from some individuals, but it’d be
good to clarify this.
L266: What are the ‘original’ animals?
Figure 1: Three of the five groups seem to consist of just one male and one female. This doesn’t
come across in the description of the results. From looking at Figure 3, there seem to be more
individuals present in your core study population than appear in Figure 1. Have you excluded
individuals born during the study period (or some other such rule)? It should be made very clear
what your criteria for inclusion in this analysis was and what the sample sizes are for each analysis.
L237-239: This sentence is a little confusing. Without the brackets, it reads ‘male ranges remaining
to 83 % and females to 85.5 % the same’. It is not clear exactly what ‘the same’ means in this
context. Do you mean that the ranges of individuals had on average 83% (males) and 85.5%
(females) overlap with the range of the same individual in the previous year?
L245: ‘actual’ is not necessary, here or in other places e.g. L253.
L245: ‘Alternate’ is the incorrect word (it means to occur in turn, or every other). I think you mean
‘Alternative’.
L253: It’d be good to compare the range shifts with the total size of the ranges. E.g. what are the
minimum and maximum dimensions of ranges?
L256-259: It is a little confusing here which figures are from the breeding vs non-breeding season.
Could you clarify which figures are for which in the brackets? Did they use more burrows in the
breeding season?
L265-269: this seems a little counter intuitive on first reading. If male ranges increase in size during
the breeding season, and overlap more with other spatial groups in the breeding season, then
wouldn’t we expect greater overlap between males and females during the breeding season? Is this
because male ranges are expanding into areas without females? This paragraph seems a bit
confusing over-all. Can you think of a way to clarify it so it’s clear what is increasing and decreasing
and why (i.e. how these increases and decreases relate to each other)?
L270: both of the figures in brackets are for ‘breeding’. I think one should be ‘non-breeding’.
L288: Please include full model details somewhere, including effect sizes.
L292: You mention significant differences (or lack thereof) but do not present test statistics.
L301: Appropriate caution should be used to interpret individuals being within 100m of each other
to be socialising or foraging together. Could two individuals not be within 100m and unaware of
each other? Perhaps behavioural observations you made during your study suggest that individuals
within 100m are always aware of each other? If so, it would strengthen your argument to include
further justification for assuming that individuals within 100m are aware of each other or are
socialising.
L310: How many relatedness values (and individuals) are you using for this analysis? Is it limited to
those individuals in your core study area (Fig 1), or the wider population? If the wider population,
then how did you define social groupings?
L312: Should this be ‘A Kruskal-Wallace…..’ There are a few grammatical errors/typos in this
sentence/paragraph so please check through.
Figure 3: I find this figure very confusing! There must be a clearer way of presenting it. Something
like Figure 4 in Griffin et al (2003) would be good if it’s possible to create this for your small sample
sizes. Perhaps also include your sample sizes in the figure too (e.g. in brackets next to the
appropriate mean relatedness value).
Griffin, A.S., Pemberton, J.M., Brotherton, P.N., McIlrath, G., Gaynor, D., Kansky, R., O'riain, J. and
Clutton-Brock, T.H., 2003. A genetic analysis of breeding success in the cooperative meerkat
(Suricata suricatta). Behavioral Ecology, 14(4), pp.472-480.’
L340: Could you clarify what you mean by ‘associations’ here. Do you mean that males within
associations of close kin fathered more pups per capita than males that were not in associations with
kin? Also, what kind of average are you using here? Values seem to be much higher than the median
value you presented earlier. Are you using means instead? If so, why? It would also be good to
include sample sizes where you quote your statistics. As you mention, sample sizes are small, so it’d
be good to include them so the reader can interpret with appropriate caution.
L350: For what proportion of litters did you detect multiple paternity? Note that this proportion
should be out of the total number of litters where it was possible to detect multiple paternity (i.e.
where more than one offspring had been assigned parentage). This might give a feeling for how
common multiple paternity is.
Table 3: Could do with further clarification. From what I can tell, you present the total number of
males present within kin associations and without kin associations, but then present the average
(mean I assume?) of females and pups. Would it make more sense to present the average number of
males instead of (or as well as) the total, so we can get an idea of what a ‘typical’ kin association
group and a ‘typical’ non-kin group looks like? Also, could you clarify how these averages were
calculated? E.g. are you presenting the average number of pups a male produces per year, or the
average production over the 3 years of your study? Including ranges or another measure of variance
may also be useful.
Discussion:
L363: it is unclear whether ‘their’ offspring refers to the offspring of the males or females.
L366: it might be worth reminding the reader that sample sizes are small so results should be
interpreted with caution and further studies are required to fully understand the intricacies of the
social system of this species.
L373: perhaps add a bit of caution here as you’ve not directly tested this. Eg. ‘This pattern most likely
reflects sexual differences in resource competition’.
L389-391: I find this last sentence a bit unclear.
L392: But you don’t actually give your definition in the methods.
L412: should this be ‘studies’ as you cite two.
L430: should this be ‘slender mongoose pups’.
L448: issue with comma use. Should one be a full stop or colon?
L460-462: It’s not entirely clear which species you’re referring to in this last sentence.
Supplementary material: As with the main paper, there are elements that could do with additional
explanation e.g. for Table B it is not clear whether the numbers represent range sizes or overlap
data. For example are values in the column 2008-2009 overlap values between 2008 and 2009, or is
it the size of the territory in the 2008-2009 field season. Also, what do ‘overlap 1’ and ‘overlap 2’
represent?

Comments to the Author(s)
Graw et al. Present novel and interesting data on the social organization of a little-
studied mongoose species. Because mongooses, as a group, remain understudied,
his report will make an important contribution to mammalian socioecology. In
addition, the existence of male associations in slender mongooses has been reported
only anecdotally. Because this aspect of their social organization is rare among
mammals, the details provided by the present ms are most welcome for those
nterested in carnivore/mammalian sociality. The data set is impressive, and the
analyses make good use of this novel information. Some points require clarification
and/or re-organization, however, but they are mainly limited to the Introduction and
Discussion, so that only relatively minor revisions are necessary to make this ms
acceptable for publication.
On conceptual point requiring revision is evident from the first two sentences of the
abstract already. The authors are interested in several aspects of the social system
of this species, but exact definitions and relationships among the different
components remain unclear. They also interpret their findings with respect to the
evel of social complexity, which is intimately related to the first aspect. These
conceptual relationships have been defined and characterized in a recent review
Kappeler P.M. 2019 A framework for studying social complexity. Behavioral Ecology
and Sociobiology 73, 13. (doi:10.1007/s00265-018-2601-8) that was not yet
published when this ms was drafted. It may provide some structural and semantic
guidance for framing their study aims and predictions. I am, of course, not insisting
hat the authors follow my classification scheme, but I think that it will help clarify their
hinking and writing about social organization, social structure and aspects of the
mating system.
- Thank you, that was a very helpful paper. We included some of your suggestions into
our introduction (L 41-45).
L. 68: male alliances were also reported for the narrow-striped mongoose (Schneider
TC, Kappeler PM (2016) Gregarious sexual segregation: the unusual social
organization of the Malagasy narrow-striped mongoose (Mungotictis decemlineata)
Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 70:913-926 doi:10.1007/s00265-016-2113-3).
- Thank you for pointing this out. As you explain in your paper together with T.
Schneider (2016), male and female narrow-striped mongooses form associations as a predator-
avoidance strategy, in fact you state that males do give up these associations during the mating
season in the pursuit of receptive females. Male alliances as we mention them here, are
associations of males in order to gain reproductive benefits and access to otherwise less
defendable females. We therefore suggest, and you mention this in the discussion of your paper
as well, that the narrow-striped mongoose is not an example of a species forming such male
(reproductive) alliances.
The summary of mongoose social systems (line 79 ff) may perhaps benefit from
another fairly recent review of this topic (Schneider TC, Kappeler PM (2014) Social
systems and life-history characteristics of mongooses Biological Reviews 89:173-198
doi:10.1111/brv.12050).
- We agree and have included this reference (L 84-89).
The Introduction and Discussion could be better structured by inserting paragraph
breaks whenever the focus moves on to another topic (e.g. line 84 before “Here, we
nvestigate…”); this would enhance readability throughout the manuscript. In this
context, I would also like to propose to add subheaders to the Discussion.
- We have included several paragraph breaks, including the one mentioned by you in line
84. We have also added subheaders to the discussion.
L 152: it is not obvious in the Abstract that radio-tracking was limited to resting
animals in burrows. (In the Results, the authors speak of “sleeping site home
anges”). This detail should be mentioned there, and its implications/limitations
should be discussed in more detail.
- As the abstract is limited to 200 words it is unfortunately not possible to go into details
about the tracking routine there, but we mention now that we calculated sleeping ranges (L 19) .
We explained this in more detail in the methods (L 156-160) and also discussed possible
mplications in the discussion part (L 539-544).
L 311: the wording a/o definition is a bit awkward here: “Spatial groups consisted of 1
o 3 adult males”. I would not call a single individual a group. This variation may
actually also warrant some additional analyses/comment: do single males differ from
he groups in terms of body size, number of (male) relatives alive or some other
elevant trait?
- Spatial groups consisted of 1-3 adults males AND 1-4 adult females. Thank you for
pointing out, that our wording is not clear enough here. We did look into body size differences
between associated and non-associated males and could find none, same goes for any other
obvious trait. What we did find and this is mentioned in the manuscript is a slight variances in
reproductive success (L 358-359).
L 340 The reproductive success per male association is an unusual and presumably
misleading measure because it does apparently not take variation in the number of
males/members into account. Related to the previous inquiry, it would be interesting
o present (average) male reproductive success for single males and for associations
of 2 and 3 males separately.
- We agree and have therefore added information about the number of pups sired by an
associated vs a non-associated male (L 393-395). Unfortunately sample sizes were too small to
compare males in 2 vs 3 male associations.
L 477 “behaved mostly solitary” sounds awkward; “ranged” might work better as a
verb here.
- changed as suggested (L 555)
L 480: the “hidden complexities” appear as a prominent conclusion in the abstract,
but this point is not elaborated/discussed in the Discussion; it only appears at the end
of the Conclusions. Given the large number of still unstudied (presumably) solitary
carnivores/mammals, it would be helpful to elaborate a bit on which hidden
complexities were hidden for which reason, why/how they were brought to the
oreground and what exactly the complexity part entails. Sorry to refer to another
earlier study of mine (Kappeler PM, Wimmer B, Zinner D, Tautz D (2002) The hidden
matrilineal structure of a solitary lemur: implications for primate social evolution.
Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B 269:1755-1763
doi:10.1098/rspb.2002.2066), but it provides another example of this point that I find
worth emphasizing.
- Thank you for pointing this out, we added a paragraph addressing social complexitiy in
he slender mongoose tot he manuskript and included your reference (L 527-536).
am really sorry for highlighting some of my own previous papers; I hate reviews
where referees say “you should cite me here or there”, but it will hopefully be evident
hat these recommendations are motivated by an attempt to make an interesting and
very good paper even a little bit better.
- Many thanks for the very helpful comments and we should have brought in some of
your papers in the first round. It certainly improves the work.

Reviewer 2:
This study combines genetic and behavioural data to further our understanding of the
social and breeding system of the slender mongoose. I find it to be generally well-
written, with the introduction nicely setting up the background of the study, and the
discussion putting the results into context. As the authors point out, studies of
mammalian species that are solitary and difficult to habituate are rare and hence the
present study provides a valuable contribution to our understanding of mammalian
social biology. I suggest some additional clarification in the methods and results,
particularly clarifying ethical aspects, sample sizes and figure 3. However, on the
whole, I think this paper is a valuable contribution to the literature.
Abstract:
L18-19: This sentence could be clearer. At the moment, it’s not entirely clear what
overlaps what. Consider splitting into two sentences, one focused on males and one
on females.
- We rearranged this sentence and split it in two (L 17-20).
ntroduction: Generally very nicely written, with the background and context of the
study well explained.
L37: typo? Should this be ‘male alliance formation’
- Yes, thank you for pointing this out. Has been changed accordingly (L 37).
L64-65: I think that the sentence would be clearer with ‘especially in species with
synchronised estrus’ in brackets.
- changed accordingly (L 69-70)
L83: It would make sense to include a reference for the long-term study of dwarf
mongooses, since you include references for the other two studies/species.
- Thank you for pointing this out, we agree and have included a reference for the dwarf
mongooses (L 88).
L95: It’s not very clear what ‘the other studies’ means. Do you mean all other
published work on this species? Perhaps rephrase to ‘Previous studies ...’
- changed to `previous studies` (L 100)
Methods: Generally clear, but ethical information is missing. Could you include
details of the weight of collars as a proportion of the body weight, details on how
stress was minimised during capture. How long did captures take? How frequently
were traps checked? Was any food/water provided? Were individuals monitored after
anaesthesia? Were there any adverse effects?
- We included a detailed ethical statement answering those questions (L 218-250). If this
s too elaborate, we can shorten according to any feedback.
t would also be good if you could include an explanation of exactly how you defined
spatial groups here. I know you include a general definition in the introduction, but
one more specific to your study would help to justify your categorisations.
- We added some information on how we determined spatial groups into the methods
section (L 172-175).
L141: ‘During captures’ is a little confusing. Perhaps re-phrase as ‘Over our study
period, we made a total of 215 captures, comprising 131 unique individuals...’
- We rephrased this sentence making it clearer (L 146-147).
L144-145: ‘Whenever possible we radio-collared at least two adults in close
proximity.’ is not very clear. Could you clarify? Details of the number of individuals
collared would be useful here. I assume you didn’t collar all 131 individuals? Given
hat tracking details are in the following paragraph, perhaps move this sentence to
he next paragraph.
- We moved this sentence into the next paragraph and added ´caught in close proximity`,
hopefully making this more clear (L 153).
L127 (Capture procedure): No details of anaesthetic are given. I assume you
anaesthetised animals before ageing, sexing, microchipping and DNA sampling.
Also, how was the tissue sample taken? E.g. using surgical scissors/scalpel? How
were infection chances minimised? Were the scissors/scalpel sterilised? Was any
antiseptic applied?
- We have included details on this procedure in the ethical statement (L 218-250).
L165-166: Are there any references for this software?
- We have added the reference (L 172).
L171: remove comma.
- Done (L 175).
L180-182: This sentence is confusing – comma use issue?
- We added to this sentence in order to make it more clear that animals had to be located
rom both receiver stations within a two minute time frame (L 191-192).
L194: What measure of relatedness did you use, and why? There are many slightly
different measures with different benefits.
- We used the Queller & Goodnight estimator. We specifically mention this now (L 205-
206).
L201: ‘less’ should be ‘fewer’
- changed accordingly (L 211)
Results: Some of your results could be clearer. In particular, sample sizes need
clarifying, figure legends could do with further explanation, and figure 3 is particularly
confusing and could be replaced with something more intuitive.
L212: The number of individuals you’ve included is lower than the number you report
n the methods. I assume this is because you didn’t get enough data from some
ndividuals, but it’d be good to clarify this.
- We mention that we calculated ranges for the 26 slender mongooses `that were tracked
at least 50 times during the study period (range: 51-412 trackings, mean ±SE: 126 trackings ±
25) and 30 times annually ´. (L 255-258)
L266: What are the ‘original’ animals?
- We meant to say the `animals originally caught in 2008´ at the beginning of our study
and have changed this accordingly (L 271-272).
Figure 1: Three of the five groups seem to consist of just one male and one female.
This doesn’t come across in the description of the results. From looking at Figure 3,
here seem to be more individuals present in your core study population than appear
n Figure 1. Have you excluded individuals born during the study period (or some
other such rule)? It should be made very clear what your criteria for inclusion in this
analysis was and what the sample sizes are for each analysis.
- Figure 1 only shows the animals that were originally collared at the beginning of the
study in 2008. This figure is supposed to give an overview of range sizes in the different sexes
and overlap patterns within and between spatial groups. Consecutively more individuals were
collared and in some cases these original animals died or disappeared and were replaced by new
ones, therefore the difference in sample size. Displaying all collared animals would have made
he figure too crowded, also not all tracked animals were alive at the same time. We clarified this
n the figure legend (L 270-271).
L237-239: This sentence is a little confusing. Without the brackets, it reads ‘male
anges remaining to 83 % and females to 85.5 % the same’. It is not clear exactly
what ‘the same’ means in this context. Do you mean that the ranges of individuals
had on average 83% (males) and 85.5% (females) overlap with the range of the
same individual in the previous year?
- Yes, as indicated in the methods section (L 176), we compared the overlap of ranges of
ndividuals in consecutive years, ranges overlapped around 83% / 85.5% with those of previous
years. We changed this sentence to hopefully make it more clear (L 282-285).
L245: ‘actual’ is not necessary, here or in other places e.g. L253.
- We deleted these.
L245: ‘Alternate’ is the incorrect word (it means to occur in turn, or every other). I
hink you mean ‘Alternative’.
- Thank you for seeing this, changed accordingly (L 290).
L253: It’d be good to compare the range shifts with the total size of the ranges. E.g.
what are the minimum and maximum dimensions of ranges?
- Mean annual and total range sizes are given above (L 258-261). For males minimum
otal range size was 1 km2, maximum was 6.21 km2; for females total ranges varied between
0.53 km2 and 2.06 km2, we added this information into the manuscript (L 298-299).
L256-259: It is a little confusing here which figures are from the breeding vs non-
breeding season. Could you clarify which figures are for which in the brackets? Did
hey use more burrows in the breeding season?
- Yes, they do use more burrows during the breeding season. We changed the order and
wording in the brackets and hopefully made it more clear (L 304-305).
L265-269: this seems a little counter intuitive on first reading. If male ranges increase
n size during the breeding season, and overlap more with other spatial groups in the
breeding season, then wouldn’t we expect greater overlap between males and
emales during the breeding season? Is this because male ranges are expanding into
areas without females? This paragraph seems a bit confusing over-all. Can you think
of a way to clarify it so it’s clear what is increasing and decreasing and why (i.e. how
hese increases and decreases relate to each other)?
- We rephrased this (L 311-314). Because male ranges are bigger during the breeding
season, less percentage of male ranges gets overlapped by female ranges during the breeding
season.
L270: both of the figures in brackets are for ‘breeding’. I think one should be ‘non-
breeding’.
- You are correct, we corrected this (L 316).
L288: Please include full model details somewhere, including effect sizes.
- We have included effect sizes and confidence intervals in the text as well as the spread
of the random effects (L 331-335).
L292: You mention significant differences (or lack thereof) but do not present test
statistics.
- We added statistics here (L 341).
L301: Appropriate caution should be used to interpret individuals being within 100m
of each other to be socialising or foraging together. Could two individuals not be
within 100m and unaware of each other? Perhaps behavioural observations you
made during your study suggest that individuals within 100m are always aware of
each other? If so, it would strengthen your argument to include further justification for
assuming that individuals within 100m are aware of each other or are socialising.
- We agree, it is possible that mongooses at 100m are still unaware of each other and we
cannot exclude that. We rephrased this sentence to explain that we do not mean to imply that
hey were always aware of each other (L 348).
L310: How many relatedness values (and individuals) are you using for this analysis?
s it limited to those individuals in your core study area (Fig 1), or the wider
population? If the wider population, then how did you define social groupings?
- As mentioned in the methods part, we used adult individuals from 8 different spatial
groups throughout the study area, a total of 68 individuals. We added this information in the
results section (L 360). Spatial groups were defined by spatial behaviour (see results section on
home range size) and social behaviour/communal denning.
L312: Should this be ‘A Kruskal-Wallace.....’ There are a few grammatical
errors/typos in this sentence/paragraph so please check through.
- Thank you for pointing this out, we corrected this and made changes throughout this
paragraph (L 359-367).
Figure 3: I find this figure very confusing! There must be a clearer way of presenting
t. Something like Figure 4 in Griffin et al (2003) would be good if it’s possible to
create this for your small sample sizes. Perhaps also include your sample sizes in
he figure too (e.g. in brackets next to the appropriate mean relatedness value).
Griffin, A.S., Pemberton, J.M., Brotherton, P.N., McIlrath, G., Gaynor, D., Kansky, R.,
O'riain, J. and Clutton-Brock, T.H., 2003. A genetic analysis of breeding success in
he cooperative meerkat (Suricata suricatta). Behavioral Ecology, 14(4), pp.472-480.’
- The figure in Griffin et al. (2003) indicates pairwise relatedness values between
ndividuals, while our figure depicts relatedness based on the parentage analysis. We tried to
mprove the figure by depicting males in blue letters and females in red, instead of indicating
changes within spatial group composition with circles, we marked animals that died during the
study period with a cross. We also added tot he figure description (L 376-379).
L340: Could you clarify what you mean by ‘associations’ here. Do you mean that
males within associations of close kin fathered more pups per capita than males that
were not in associations with kin? Also, what kind of average are you using here?
Values seem to be much higher than the median value you presented earlier. Are
you using means instead? If so, why? It would also be good to include sample sizes
where you quote your statistics. As you mention, sample sizes are small, so it’d be
good to include them so the reader can interpret with appropriate caution.
- We added information to this paragraph, while before we only calculated average
number of pups fathered by males within a spatial group vs unassociated males. We also added
nformation about the rate of unsuccessful males (L 393-398).
L350: For what proportion of litters did you detect multiple paternity? Note that this
proportion should be out of the total number of litters where it was possible to detect
multiple paternity (i.e. where more than one offspring had been assigned parentage).
This might give a feeling for how common multiple paternity is.
- Thank you for pointing this out. We successfully caught 4 complete litters with more
han one pup (out of a total of 15 litters that emerged), of these 2 showed multiple paternities
(50%). As sample sizes are so small, we do not feel that we can get a strong indication from this
on how common multiple paternities are but have included this information in the manuscript
now (L 406-408).
Table 3: Could do with further clarification. From what I can tell, you present the total
number of males present within kin associations and without kin associations, but
hen present the average (mean I assume?) of females and pups. Would it make
more sense to present the average number of males instead of (or as well as) the
otal, so we can get an idea of what a ‘typical’ kin association group and a ‘typical’
non-kin group looks like? Also, could you clarify how these averages were
calculated? E.g. are you presenting the average number of pups a male produces
per year, or the average production over the 3 years of your study? Including ranges
or another measure of variance may also be useful.
- We changed table 3, so that it now shows individual reproductive success for all males
captured and analysed throughout our study, rather than focussing on our main study groups
and the success by associations. We changed the table description accordingly (L 410-411).
Discussion:
L363: it is unclear whether ‘their’ offspring refers to the offspring of the males or
emales.
- changed to `independent´ (L 422).
L366: it might be worth reminding the reader that sample sizes are small so results
should be interpreted with caution and further studies are required to fully understand
he intricacies of the social system of this species.
- We added that this is based on anecdotal data (L 424).
L373: perhaps add a bit of caution here as you’ve not directly tested this. Eg. ‘This
pattern most likely reflects sexual differences in resource competition’.
- changed accordingly (L 434)
L389-391: I find this last sentence a bit unclear.
- We tried to make this sentence more clear, see L 451.
L392: But you don’t actually give your definition in the methods.
- We added the definition now (L 172-175).
L412: should this be ‘studies’ as you cite two.
- changed (L 475)
L430: should this be ‘slender mongoose pups’.
- changed (L 493-494)
L448: issue with comma use. Should one be a full stop or colon?
- changed (L 512)
L460-462: It’s not entirely clear which species you’re referring to in this last sentence.
- We added `in the white-tailed mongoose´ (L 525).
Supplementary material: As with the main paper, there are elements that could do
with additional explanation e.g. for Table B it is not clear whether the numbers
epresent range sizes or overlap data. For example are values in the column 2008-
2009 overlap values between 2008 and 2009, or is it the size of the territory in the
2008-2009 field season. Also, what do ‘overlap 1’ and ‘overlap 2’ represent?
- We added additional information (see supplementary material_tabel B).
