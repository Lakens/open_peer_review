This study addresses the measurement biases caused by SPL meters and microphone incidence in
analyses of response characteristics of auditory cells in tympanate moths. The authors carefully
proposed the methods for measuring exact sound pressures of pulse stimuli used for
electrophysiology. But I wonder about authors’ assumption of the use of SPL meters.
1. As the authors described, the correct measurement of SPL by means of SPL meters requires the
time constant quite longer than duration of pulse stimuli presented to moth ear. Therefore,
experimenters basically do not directly read SPL displayed on a SPL meter in measurement of
SPL of pulse stimuli. In general, recorded voltages of pulse stimuli are converted to SPL by
referring to voltage of continuous sine wave (pure tone) with known SPL (measured with a SPL
meter).
2. In Fullard (1984) and other paper (e.g., Ratcliffe & Fullard (2005) J. Exp. Biol.), an Erebid
(formerly Arctiidae) moth, Cycnia tenera, generates warning tymbal clicks in response to
(simulation of) the late approach phase pulses of bat’s echolocation calls. Fig. 10 of this study
implies that C. tenera makes >4 spikes/pulse to >50 dB SPL, which is inconsistent with the
behavioral data obtained previously.

The manuscript of Thevenon and Pfuhl with the title “Discrepancies in the spiking threshold and
frequency sensitivity of nocturnal moths explainable by biases in the canonical auditory
stimulation method” deals with methodological problems in hearing research when using high
tones of high pitch and with short duration. The analysis is adequate and the problem is well
described. The manuscript is well written.
The structure of the manuscript seems not fit very well in the standard sections. In the
Introduction, the reader is introduced into the problem, but also first replotting of previous data
takes places, which extends the idea of an introduction. Furthermore, the results are told to
unfold in cascade. In Methods, parts or all of the figures might be shown as supplementary
figures. In Results, the first two paragraphs deal with known facts, e.g. belong to Introduction or
Methods. Perhaps it is possible, just to identify the problem and deal with the solutions without
the standard sections.
P4 l22 Please, explain the “Therefore” to some more detail, especially since the axes in figures 3
and 4 are not equivalent.
P 17 l50 This sub section can be shortened, although it might be important. However, the
proposed parameters are not directly related to results. On the other hand, could you give more
details, like how long would be a cylindrical chamber for a given setup? Finally, you identified
the problem with analog dB meters from the 1960s. The reader might want to know, whether
modern dB meters, apart from the problem of measuring high pitch sounds, provide any better
result.
Minor comments:
Figure 2 can be deleted.
Figure 4 Why are two parts shown? Explain the relative SPL in the legend.
Figure 5 Needs more clear labeling.
Figure 6 Are all sub-figures necessary? More clear labeling and uniform labeling. More details in
the legend, e.g. the two steps are not the two sub-figures.
Table 3 What is the unit of spiking activity or spiking threshold?
Citations and references need to be carefully checked for format and other points. Some: p2 l15
omit initials, p3 l8 et al., p4 l3 omit initial, et al., p6 l32 omit initial, p6 l49 Hildebrandt et al 2015 is

label_comment_3
The manuscript is revised adequately for easy understanding in most parts. My concern is
whether the authors can apply the SPL meter’s pulse-duration related bias to Waters’ data
8
because Waters (1996) did not fully described the method with SPL meter (type 2204) for
measuring the sound pressure level of test stimuli. I suggest that the clear statement of the
authors’ assumption for the correction of the original data should be added to the beginning of
the paragraphs for both data of Waters and Fullard (1984) in p.11.
Minor points
p.1, line 29: “echolocation signals of bat” OR “bat echolocation signals”
p.1, line 42: I think it is better not to describe “low intensity” here because readers might misread;
does bat in searching mode generate low intensity echolocation calls?
p.4, Fig.2, right panel; p.12, Fig.8: “Number of A1 + A2 cell action potentials”
p.6, line 50: Strictly speaking, Agrotis and Cycnia moths are not closely related species, they are
belonging to the same superfamily though.
p.10, line 46: Arctiidae is the former family name. Currently it is Erebidae.
p.11, Fig.7, both panels: x-axis is “relative dB SPL”
p.12, line 37, 41: Barathra brassicae is the former name. Currently it is Mamestra brassicae.

Reply to the reviewers
We thank the reviewers for their valuable feedback and suggestions to improve the manuscript. Both
eviewers raised important points, which we have fully addressed in our revised manuscript. Please
ind below our detailed replies.
Reviewer 1 wonders about our assumption of the use of SPL meters. Indeed, it is a fair question to
ask how biologists who are rarely trained in the complexities of acoustics use SPL meters.
Un-)fortunately, personal communications at meetings / conferences and with leading researchers
n this field (A. Surlykke) stimulated this work.
t is not true that an incorrect dB measurement happens once: when the sound source is calibrated,
hen the SPL meter is not used while the experimenter moves the knob to raise or lower the SPL of
he stimulation. This argument relies on the unspoken assumption that the SPL of the sound source is
graduated in dB!
However the papers all describe things well for that side of the experiments: the speaker is driven by
a wave generator — dealing with the frequency variable — and an amplifier — dealing with the
ignal passed to the speaker. Let’s assume that the amplifier is graduated in dB. Then the dBs of the
amplifier were added to the initial baseline defined with the SPL meter. Until now, the error remains
inear. However the speakers don’t have a linear output, therefore the mapping between input-dB
and speaker-dB is not linear, and neither is the mapping input-dB to moth-received-dB.
t follows that the data is all over the show and nothing can be retrieved, not even with the method
described in our manuscript. Now, it is possible that the amplifier knob was re-graduated to show the
moth-received-dB instead of its real output. In fact, that is what we think most researchers were
doing. Such re-graduation would have been made with the help of a SPL meter, therefore we’re back
o the need for our correction and the correctness of it.
Regarding Cycnia tenera, we are aware that our analysis conflicts with previously reported
behavioural data. However, our paper is aimed to show the biases, address them on those data
where enough information has been published and encourage more transparency in future
experimental data (informative method sections with all necessary details).
We think reviewer 2 refers to "Ratcliffe & Fullard (2005) J. Exp. Biol." refers to doi:10.1242/jeb.01927
This article doesn't provide feedback on the SPL of the tymbals, and the recording equipment "D980
Ultrasound Detector from Pettersson Elektronik" is first and foremost a frequency detector, not a SPL
ecorder. We couldn't find any datasheet for this "Pettersson second generation heterodyne
microphone". Indeed we would have expected to find a datasheet similar to serious measurement
microphones (like B&K or Microtech Gefell). We also looked for other papers about Cycnia tenera's
ymbals. However, in e.g. Fullard (1990) Functional organization of the arctiid moth tymbal, there are
no recordings of the tymbals' SPL. In Dawson Fullard (1995) sound production tiger moth location of
ymbal pattern generator, there is again no recordings of the tymbals' SPL. The dBs in here are
elated to the stimulus that elicit tymbal activity. In Ratcliffe (2009) tiger moths decision-making
based on activity of a single sensory neuron we find: "Acoustic stimuli and tymbal MCs produced in
esponse to these stimuli were detected using an Avisoft CM16 microphone and recorded using an
ultrasound acquisition board (Avisoft USG 416) connected to a laptop running AVISOFT RECORDER at
a sampling rate of 250 kHz." Unfortunately, the documentation available on Avisoft is insufficient,
and the size of the microphone makes it a good candidate to fall in the bias described in our paper.
The frequency response graph and the polar diagram found here justify our doubts. Finally, we can
not find the distance between the moth and the speaker, therefore we can't know how far from the
peaker/moth the microphone was (beside being at the same distance of both), and we don't know
about its orientation to the sound waves.
As shown in our literature review, not all papers that studied the auditory system in moths were
eligible, mainly due to incomplete reporting of the methods.
Reviewer 2 pointed out our non-standard sectioning of the paper. We have re-sectioned the
manuscript, and provide one heading for methods and results now (with subheadings). It is correct
hat we review Fullard and Waters data in the introduction and visualize it in Figure 2 and 3. We find
his necessary to understand the results which we briefly summarize at the end of the introduction.
We do keep all but one of our original figures in the text, as the journal is an online only journal and
eparating the methods into a short section and a supplementary part is inconvenient for the
nterested reader. We also find it important that the reader can follow our steps and see the inherent
challenge with e.g. SPL meters.
Regarding shortening one of the sub-sections: our re-structuring has moved this section from the
discussion part to the end of the method / result section and merged with the description of
minimizing the biases.
Regarding more information on the cylindrical chamber we suggest a minimum of 3x the Fraunhofer
distance but we refrained from making a numerical suggestion in the paper. We would like to point
out, that Roeder and Treat’s setup was very good at minimizing biases. Larger testing areas or
outdoor testing would be our recommendation.
We are very grateful for the careful reading and identification of citation and reference issues. We
updated the manuscript with color figures were it will ease the reading, and improved our labeling,
as well as we corrected citation issues in the main text, and references have been corrected.
Appendix B
Reply to reviewers
The manuscript is revised adequately for easy understanding in most parts. My concern is whether
he authors can apply the SPL meter’s pulse-duration related bias to Waters’ data because Waters
1996) did not fully described the method with SPL meter (type 2204) for measuring the sound
pressure level of test stimuli. I suggest that the clear statement of the authors’ assumption for the
correction of the original data should be added to the beginning of the paragraphs for both data of
Waters and Fullard (1984) in p.11.
Our response: Water's method is better described than Fullard's, and however we understand
Water's description, it fits the requirement. Regarding Fullard's figure 5, the data comes from a single
moth and the number of points is small. Consequently it is not a big stretch to assume that all the dB
SPL reported were based on the same reference. If we accept the assumption then the primary
ransformation (Figure 2) has no impact on the correction of the SPL data.
We have now inserted a clarifying statement on page 10:
The correction process does not attempt to derive absolute measurements from relative
measurements. That is not possible. However what is possible is to correct the slope of the dB SPL
eported within the context of each stimulus {frequency, repetition rate}.
We thank the reviewer for pointing out the minor points, and all have been corrected, including
igure panels.
