The manuscript “Kinetics and mechanism of selenate and selenite removal in solution by sulfate-
green rust” (RSOS-181464) presents interest study about the Se removal using sulfate-green rust. I
would say this study present high quality data to support their conclusion. The manuscript is
generally well written and easy to understand. Since the adsorption and reduction of Se by GRs
might be complicated, the author tried to make sufficient discussion to reveal the Se removal
mechanism. I think this paper could be published with minor revision.
Specific Comments:
1. Intorduction P2, L1-2: “When the contaminated water contains already dissolved iron, an ideal
alternative to externally-added removing agents is the immobilization on green rust”. I think
there should be other reasons to use GRs, such as the easy production using novel methods
(reference 22) , cheap price but high reducing capacity.
2. Preparation of Green Rust: please add some references to support the synthesis methods.
3. Is it possible to merge Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 in one column? They can share the same X axis.
4. P4, L55: “selenate was easier to reduce that selenite”, “that” should be “than”?
5. Fig 8 seems to repeatedly present the data in Table 3.
3
6. Fig. 10 should be removed since the author provides data in Table 4.
7. I think the authors have present sufficient data in this study, however, the discussion could be
improve by separating the results and discussion, so that the highlights can be emphasized in the
discussion. It might be a good way to make the logic clearer when the authors have much data to
present.

The authors have done a good job improving the language and addressing major reviewer
comments. I only have one comment:
Line 55-56: “The total volume was set to reach a total Fe concentration of 0.036 mol/L (2000
mg/L). The Se concentration was set at 500 mg/L while the pH was adjusted to 8 or 9 by adding
0.25 M NaOH. While the synthesis of GR was conducted inside a glovebox, removal experiments
were conducted in a separable flask under open air atmosphere, for 2 hours under magnetic
stirring (300 rpm) and constant pH. During the experiments, the suspensions were continuously
purged with Ar gas to limit the concentration of dissolved oxygen”
I suggest the following alternative text to resolve the confusion with your ‘open air’ statement:
Removal experiments were conducted by adding the GR suspension to the aqueous solutions
containing Se. The suspension was mixed by magnetic stirring (300 rpm) and purged
continuously with Ar gas to limit the concentration of dissolved oxygen. The total volume was set
to reach a total Fe concentration of 0.036 mol/L (2000 mg/L).
The Se concentration was set at 500 mg/L while the pH was adjusted to 8 or 9 by adding 0.25 M
NaOH. An automatic titrator (TS-2000, HIRANUMA SANGYO, Japan) adding 0.5 M NaOH was
used to compensate for the pH decrease during the experiments. The redox potential was
continuously monitored through an ORP electrode (D-75, HORIBA, Japan).

General comments
This study reports an experimental study of removal of selenite and selenate from water by green
rust (GR) for understanding of the interaction between selenite/selenate and GR. The authors
presented the original research from an experimental study on the synthesized GR and applied
this material to the treatment of selenite/selenate in hydrosphere. Whilst the subject of this study
is not novel and several earlier studies reported similar investigations, the work of Onoguchi and
coworkers investigated the mechanism of sorption and reduction process. I appreciate that the
authors have applied EXAFS and various techniques to investigate mechanism. I think that the
paper can be improved after revising. However, I recommend a somewhat revision prior to
publication in R. Soc. Open Sci.
Specific comments
1) The details on TEM-EDS operation parameters should be mentioned, such as accelerating
voltage.
2) Add specifications of the beamline (energy range of BL5S1, detectors, optical system).
3) The detailed analysis procedure of EXAFS should be described in the manuscript.
4) P3L52: I think authors made mistake on pKa2 of selenite. The pKa2 of selenite should be 8.32
and this should influence the discussion of selenite sorption and discussion.
5) For Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, the GR seems to convert into goethite and magnetite after reaction with
Se(IV) under pH 9. However, the dissolved sulfate concentration did not increase. Could authors
interpret this? Where is the sulfate?
6) The formula of goethite and magnetite should be given in the manuscript.
8
7) Under pH 8, the sorption mechanisms of selenite/selenate should be different based on Fig. 3.
Some discussion can be added in this part.
8) For Fig. 5, why the particle size of reduced Se is different for selenite/selenite?

25 1. Summary
26
27 This work investigated the removal of selenite and selenate from water by sulfate-green rust (GR). Selenite was
28 immobilized by simple adsorption onto GR at pH 8, and by adsorption-reduction at pH 9. Selenate was
29
immobilized by adsorption-reduction to selenite and by direct reduction to Se0 at both pH 8 and 9. In the process,
30
31 GR oxidized to goethite and magnetite. The removal of selenite and selenate by GR was kinetically described
32 through a pseudo-second order model based on inductively-coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP) results. XAFS
33 analysis enabled to elucidate the concentration profiles of Se and Fe species in the solid phase and allowed to
34 distinguish two removal mechanism, namely adsorption and reduction. Selenite and selenate were reduced by
35 GR through homogeneous solid-phase reaction upon adsorption and by heterogeneous reaction at the solid-
36 liquid interface. The selenite reduced through heterogeneous reduction with GR was adsorbed onto GR but not
37 reduced further. The redox reaction between GR and selenite/selenate was kinetically described through an
38
irreversible second order bimolecular reaction model based on XAFS concentration profiles. Although the redox
39
40 reaction became faster at pH 9, simple adsorption was always the fastest removal mechanism.

2. Introduction
45 Selenium is an essential element for humans but becomes carcinogenic and teratogenic at high concentrations 1,2.
46 It commonly exists under four oxidation states, among which Se(IV) as selenite (SeO32-) and Se(VI) as selenate
47 (SeO42-) are the most stable species in water. Water pollution by selenate and selenite arises mostly from
48 anthropic activities such as agricultural practices3, power generation4 and mining5. Therefore, given the large
49 amount of water involved in these activities, selenium pollution should not be underestimated.
50
The removal of SeO42- and SeO32- from water has been object of many research works. Biological methods under
51
anaerobic6, oxic7 and anoxic8 conditions were proven effective and sustainable but relatively slow. Adsorption
52
53 on carbon nanospheres9, ferrous hydroxide10, ettringite11 and barite12 were described as possible alternatives to
54 biological methods. However much research is still needed to achieve the efficiency and/or sustainability
55 required to implement real processes. Reduction with zero-valent iron was also proven as an efficient method8,13–
56 15. However, a large amount of zero-valent iron should be specifically added to the wastewater in order to reduce
57 and immobilize selenium species.

Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 2 of 13
When the contaminated water contains already dissolved iron, an ideal alternative to externally-added
1 removing agents is the immobilization on green rust16. Green Rust (GR) is a mixed Fe(II)–Fe(III) hydroxide
2 compound with layered double hydroxide (LDH) structure 17. GR can be described through the formula [FeII(1-
3 x)FeIIIx(OH)2]x+[(x/n)An(mx/n)H2O]x, where A represents anions like chloride, carbonate18 or sulfate19,20. In GR,
4 Fe(II) and Fe(III) hydroxides units exhibit octahedral structure and occupy positively charged surface portions 21.
5
Water molecules and anions are instead located in the interlayer between Fe(II)-Fe(III) octahedra to balance the
6
7 charge22. Due to the presence of Fe(II) on the surface, GR exhibits reducing strength that can be conveniently
8 utilized to reduce oxidized contaminants such as nitrate 23, chromate24 and arsenic anions25,26.
9 GR has also showed an interesting activity in the immobilization of selenate from water. Refait et al. (2000)
10 described the intercalation of selenate into GR’s interlayer27. However, authors did not assess the reducing
11 capability of GR and its fate upon intercalation. Hayashi et al. (2009) highlighted that GR can adsorb and reduce
12 selenate to Se0, oxidizing itself to goethite and/or magnetite depending on the pH. Authors speculated about the
13 simultaneous reduction of selenate to selenite and Se 0 but did not provide any specific evidence about it28.
14
Moreover, neither the reactions pathway nor the removal kinetics have been elucidated, while there are no
15
16 information at all about the possibility to remove selenite.
17 This study addressed the removal of selenite and selenite at pH 8 and 9 by sulfate-GR. Sulfate-GR was selected
18 over other types of GRs because the sulfate ion is often available in wastewaters contaminated by selenium (e.g.
19 acid mine drainage). Batch removal experiments were carried out to investigate the evolution of selenium and
20 iron species during removal along with the removal kinetics. An approach based on ICP and XAFS analysis was
21 used to elucidate the evolution of Se(IV), Se(VI) and Fe species, clarify the reactions pathway and assess the
22 contribution of adsorption and reduction to the overall Se removal kinetics.

3. Materials and Methods
28
29 3.1 Preparation of Green Rust
30 GR was prepared within a glove box (UN-650L, UNICO LTD, Japan) under Ar atmosphere to prevent oxidation.
31 All solutions were prepared using distilled and ion exchanged water (Aquarius RFD 240NA, ADVANTEC,
32 JAPAN) and were flushed with Ar gas to remove the dissolved oxygen prior to use. The GR precursor solution
33 was prepared dissolving FeSO4<U+F09E>7H2O and Fe2(SO4)3<U+F09E>nH2O in the ratio Fe(II)/Fe(III) = 0.75 up to achieve a total
34 Fe concentration of 22.3 g/L. The solution was then titrated with 8 M NaOH (addition speed: 2.3×10 -7 dm3/min)
35
up to reach pH 7.5. GR was separated from the obtained slurry by centrifugation (Himac CR21, HITACHI,
36
JAPAN) at 1000 G for 10 minutes and washed with ion-exchanged-distilled and de-oxygenated water for three
37
38 times. After washing, the GR precipitate was re-suspended in de-oxygenated water, and later used as it was in
39 removal experiments.
40
41 3.2 Selenium removal experiments
42 Removal experiments were conducted adding the GR suspension to the aqueous solutions containing Se up to
43 reach a total Fe concentration of 2000 mg/L. The Se concentration was set at 500 mg/L while the pH was adjusted
44
to 8 or 9. Experiments were conducted under open air atmosphere, for 2 hours under magnetic stirring (300
45
rpm) and constant pH. During the experiments, the suspensions were continuously flushed with Ar gas to limit
46
47 the concentration of dissolved oxygen. An automatic titrator (TS-2000, HIRANUMA SANGYO, Japan) adding
48 0.5 M NaOH was used to compensate for the pH decrease during the experiments. The redox potential was
49 continuously monitored through an ORP electrode (D-75, HORIBA, Japan).
50
51 3.3 Analysis
52 The concentration of Se in solution was determined by inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission
53
spectrometry (ICP-AES, SPS7800, SEIKO INSTUMENT, Japan) after filtration. The phase composition and
54
crystal structure of solid products from removal experiments were determined by x-ray diffraction (Geiger flex
55
56 RAD-IX, RIGAKU, Japan) with a copper target (CuKa) a crystal graphite monochromator and a scintillation
57 detector. The X-ray source was operated at 40 kV and 30 mA with step scanning from 2<U+03B8> values of 2 to 80°,
58 sequential increments of 0.02° and a scan speed of 2°/min. To avoid the oxidation of samples between

5 mapping was applied to the same micrographs to identify the distribution of Fe and Se in the solid phase. For
6 this purpose, samples were set on an elastic carbon support film (STEM 100 Cu grid, grid pitch 100 µm,
7 OKENSHOJI, Japan) drying directly from the Ar purged glove box after vacuum drying. The Se K-edge and Fe
8 K-edge X-ray adsorption fine structure (XAFS) were performed at the BL5S1 beamline of the Aichi Synchrotron

39 Results highlighted that selenite was removed to a larger extent at pH 8, whereas the largest removal of selenate
40 was observed at pH 9. In the experiments with selenite, the Se concentration rapidly decreased upon contact
41 with GR. However, while at pH 8 Se concentration reached a plateau after the first dramatic decrease, at pH 9
42 selenium re-dissolved. Following this re-dissolution, the concentration of Se in solution started decreasing again
43 at a clearly lower rate. This trend suggested that two different phenomena with probably different rates might
44
be involved in the removal of selenium by GR. In the experiments with Se(VI), Se concentration exhibited similar
45
profiles but with a smoother initial decrease. Furthermore, the best removal performance was observed at pH
46
47 9. The larger removal of selenate at pH 9 is contrasting with what reported by Hayashi et al. (2009), who
48 described pH 7.5 as the best condition to remove Se(VI) in the pH range 7-10. To elucidate this aspect, the trends
49 of sulfate concentration and Fe2+/total Fe molar ratio (Fe2+/T-Fe) in solution were continuously monitored during
50 the experiments. Results are shown in Fig.2a and 2b. Fig. 3 shows the redox potential (vs SHE) measured during
51 removal experiments and the cumulative addition of NaOH to titrate the system.

32 The initial Fe2+/T-Fe ratio in GR was 0.66, very close to the ideal ratio reported in literature31,32. This ratio
33 progressively decreased in all experiments, beside the one with Se(IV) at pH 8. The decreasing Fe2+/T-Fe ratio
34 was a clear suggestion that GR was being oxidized while removing selenite and/or selenate. Accordingly, SO 42-
35
was released in solution following GR oxidation (Fig. 2b). Both trends were in general more pronounced at pH
36
37 9. In contrast, the Fe2+/T-Fe ratio was nearly constant in the experiment with selenite at pH 8, though the removal
38 of selenium was the largest. This evidence revealed as selenite at pH 8 was removed from solution without
39 reduction. The very low amount of sulfate released in the same experiment can be considered as an evidence
40 that selenite was removed by simple adsorption onto GR. In fact, if the immobilization occurred via intercalation
41 in GR interlayer, the sulfate release should be stoichiometric to selenite in order to maintain the charge balance
42 within GR. Like in the experiments at pH 8, the concentration of dissolved Se decreased rapidly upon contact
43 with GR also at pH 9, thus suggesting a quick adsorption onto GR. However, at pH 9 selenite re-dissolved again
44
after the initial removal. Given the decreasing Fe2+/T-Fe ratio and the release of SO42-, it is possible that about
45
46 50% of the selenite initially adsorbed was released due to GR oxidation.
47 The above mentioned consideration were supported also by the redox potential in solution (Fig. 3b). In all
48 experiments, the redox potential sharply decreased upon adding GR to the selenite/selenate solutions. The
49 polarization at lower potentials revealed as the system became electrochemically controlled by the redox
50 couples Fe3+/Fe2+ and SeO42-/SeO32-. Following the initial sharp polarization, the potential started decreasing
51 again but slowly due to reduction of selenite/selenate. The slow decrease was not observed in the experiment
52 with Se(IV) at pH 8, as a further proof that selenite was removed via simple adsorption. In contrast, the largest
53
Eh decrease was observed in the experiments with selenate at pH 9, as also expected from the Fe 2+/T-Fe trend.
54
55 This evidence was a further indication that (i) selenate was easier to reduce that selenite, and that (ii) pH 9
56 favored the redox reaction.

22 The XRD patterns in Fig. 4 exhibited the typical peaks of goethite and magnetite under all investigated
23
conditions except for Se(IV) at pH 8. Although selenium species were not detected, the only presence of GR in
24
25 the XRD pattern of the solid residue from the experiment with selenite at pH 8 confirmed the removal via
26 adsorption. The presence of Se in all residual solids was confirmed by FE-TEM-EDX analysis and image
27 mapping (Fig. 5). In the TEM micrographs, the hexagonal flakes corresponded to GR22 while the rods observed
28 in the other experiments could be either magnetite or goethite33, in agreement with XRD results. The solid
29 residue from the experiment with selenite at pH 9 exhibited yellow spherical particles, most likely
30 corresponding to Se0. On the other hand, the solid residues from the experiments with selenate exhibited also
31 yellow portions with elongated shape, suggesting the presence of selenite adsorbed onto magnetite and/or
32
goethite.

31 The Se k-edge XANES and the EXAFS function k3<U+03C7>(k) spectra of the solid residue from the experiment with
32 Se(IV) at pH 8 revealed the only presence of selenite and GR, as also expected from the above described results.
33 In contrast, Se(IV), Se0, GR and goethite were confirmed in the solid residue at pH 9. Fitting results highlighted
34
as about 25% of selenite was reduced to Se0 at the expenses of GR, which oxidized to goethite as in (1):

37
XAFS results from the experiment with selenate at pH 8 exhibited multiple peaks around 12652, 12657 and 12659
38
39 eV. These peaks revealed the presence of Se 0 and Se(IV) in the solid residue. The EXAFS function k 3<U+03C7>(k) of the
40 same sample revealed the conversion of about 29% GR to 22% goethite and about 7% magnetite. Clearly,
41 selenate was reduced to selenite and Se0 using the electrons generated from the oxidation of GR to goethite and
42 magnetite an as in (2)-(5).

51
52 Given the solubility of selenite, the presence of Se(IV) in the solid residues revealed as the selenite formed from
53 reduction of selenate was adsorbed by GR and/or iron products. Nevertheless, it was not possible to understand
54 whether selenite was adsorbed upon heterogeneous reduction between GR and selenate, or if it was generated
55 from already adsorbed selenate that remained adsorbed after reduction. This aspect will be discussed in section
56 3.4.
57 Increasing the removal pH from 8 to 9 resulted into a more pronounced reduction of selenate to Se 0. As a
58
consequence of the larger amount of exchanged electrons, more GR oxidized to goethite (64%) and magnetite
59
60 (18%). The significantly positive effect of pH on the extent of redox reaction is consistent with the stoichiometry
of reactions (2)-(5) as hydroxyl ions are required for the reaction to take place. The simultaneous reduction of
selenate to both goethite and magnetite is contrasting with results reported by Hayashi et al. (2009) and Myneni

2 et al., 1997, who described the preferential formation of magnetite at pH 9 35. The difference might be due to the
3
different experimental conditions used in this work (e.g. constant pH through addition of NaOH, lower Fe/Se
4
5 molar ratio).
6
7 4.4 Reaction pathway and kinetics
8 Since the immobilization of selenium involved the adsorption and/or reduction of Se species on GR surface, the
9 kinetic analysis of Se removal was performed using a pseudo-second order model36. According to the model,
10 the adsorption rate is proportional to the second power of the sites available for adsorption/reaction37 as in (6):
11
<U+0001D41D><U+0001D42A><U+0001D42D>
12 = <U+0001D424>(<U+0001D42A><U+0001D41E> - <U+0001D42A><U+0001D42D> )<U+0001D7D0> (6)
13 <U+0001D41D><U+0001D42D>
14 Where qe and qt are the sorption densities at time t and equilibrium, determined respectively as in (7) and (8):
15 (<U+0001D402><U+0001D422> - <U+0001D402><U+0001D41E> )<U+0001D415>
16 <U+0001D42A><U+0001D41E> = (7)
<U+0001D40C>
17
18 (<U+0001D402><U+0001D422> - <U+0001D402><U+0001D42D> )<U+0001D415>
19 <U+0001D42A><U+0001D42D> = (8)
<U+0001D40C>
20
In (7) and (8), <U+0001D436><U+0001D456> , <U+0001D436><U+0001D452> and <U+0001D436><U+0001D461> [mmol/L] are the concentrations of Se(IV) or Se(VI) at initial, equilibrium and time t,
21
22 respectively. M is the mass of T-Fe [g] calculated from the formula of GR, V is the volume of solution [L] and k
23 is the adsorption rate constant. For the boundary conditions t = 0 to t = t and qt, the integrated form of equation
24 (6) becomes like in (9):
25 <U+0001D42D> <U+0001D7CF> <U+0001D7CF>
26 = <U+0001D42D>+ <U+0001D7D0> (9)
<U+0001D42A><U+0001D42D> <U+0001D42A><U+0001D41E> <U+0001D42A><U+0001D41E> <U+0001D424>
27
28 Accordingly, if the removal reaction follows a pseudo-second order kinetics, the experimental points plotted as
29 t/qt vs time align through a straight line with slope 1/qe and intercept 1/qe2k. The plots of t/qt vs time are shown
30 in Fig. 7. Fitting parameters from Fig. 7 are listed in Table 2.

59 The good fitting from Fig. 7 highlighted the suitability of the pseudo-second order model to describe the
60 removal of selenite and selenate by GR at pH 8 and 9. The removal rate constant was the highest in the
experiment with selenite at pH 8, thus highlighting that simple adsorption was the fastest removal mechanism.
Increasing the pH from 8 to 9 promoted the redox reaction between selenite and GR. As a consequence, the

kinetics was slower because GR structure was destroyed and the adsorbed selenite was released in solution. In
1 contrast, the removal of selenate was the fastest at pH 9, condition that determined also the most pronounced
2 redox reaction.
3 To identify the phenomena involved in the removal of selenium and to assess their contribution to the overall
4 kinetics, XAFS analysis was extended to samples at 5, 15, 20, 30, 90 and 120 minutes. Fitting results from XAFS

spectra are listed in Table 3 while the plots of data in Table 3 representing the evolution of Se and Fe species

48 From the graphs in Fig. 8, it was clear that selenite was adsorbed onto GR and/or reduced to Se0 upon adsorption.
49 The concentration profiles also suggested a fast adsorption of the initial Se(IV) and Se(VI) followed by their
50 (slower) redox reactions to Se0 (Fig. 8b) and Se(IV) and/or Se0 (fig. 8d and 8f), respectively. The first interesting
51 point to note is the concentration profile of Se(VI) in the solid phase. Although for practical reasons the first
52 sample for XAFS analysis was taken 5 minutes after realizing the contact Se-GR, the Se(VI) concentration must
53 be clearly 0 before contact (time 0). Therefore, the concentration of Se(VI) must have reached a maximum at t =
54
5 minutes before being consumed. This was a clear evidence that selenate was quickly adsorbed onto GR, as
55
initially suggested by Fig. 1. Following the adsorption, Se(VI) was reduced to Se(IV) and/or Se 0. However, Fig.
56
57 8b-8d-8f revealed also as the concentrations of reduced selenium species (Se 0 in the experiment with selenite,
58 Se(IV) and Se0 in the experiment with selenate) were still decreasing after all initially adsorbed Se was consumed.
59 This evidence suggested two considerations. First, not only the adsorbed selenite/selenate could be reduced by
60 GR (homogenous reaction) but also their dissolved counterparts upon contact with GR (heterogeneous reaction).
Moreover, because selenite is soluble, the presence of Se(IV) in the solid phase could be explained only by
considering the adsorption of the selenite formed by heterogeneous reaction between GR and selenate. In this

view, the slow removal of Se following the initial large concentration drop observed in Fig. 1 must be the main
1 consequence of the heterogeneous redox reaction. Another interesting point to note is the simultaneous
2 reduction of selenate to selenite and Se0 (Fig. 8d-8f). Although the reduction of selenate could be described by a
3 series of two irreversible reductions (e.g.to selenite first and, in turn, to Se0), the monotonic trend of Se(IV) was
4 more consistent with a parallel reduction of the adsorbed selenate to adsorbed selenite and/or Se0. In other
5
words, the adsorbed selenite could not be reduced further to Se0. This evidence might be caused by the depletion
6
7 of Fe(II) in the proximity of the Fe(III) adsorption sites due to reduction of selenate to selenite. A similar
8 consideration can be proposed based on the concentration profiles of Fe species. The monotonic trends of GR,
9 magnetite and goethite suggested that GR oxidized either to magnetite or to goethite, whereas the oxidation of
10 magnetite to goethite did not occur.
11 Based on GR consumption (XAFS results), amount of precipitated iron, selenium removed (ICP results) and the
12 stoichiometry of redox reactions (2)-(5), an electron balance was carried out to assess the efficiency of GR to
13 reduce Se(IV) and Se(VI). The relationship between electrons produced through GR oxidation and electrons
14
used in the reduction of Se(IV) and Se(VI) is shown in Fig, 9. The linear correlation with unitary slope shown in
15
16 Fig. 9 confirmed the effectiveness of GR in the reduction of selenite at pH 9 and selenate at both pH 8 and 9. The
17 slight positive deviation observed from 0.010 mol/dm 3 (condition corresponding to the experimental points at
18 90 and 120 minutes) in the experiments with Se(VI) at pH 9 revealed that some of the electrons from GR were
19 not used to reduce selenate. There are two possible explanations for the observed deviation. One is the partial
20 unwanted oxidation of GR by air, though Ar gas was continuously bubbled into the reacting system. Another
21 possible explanation involves the reduction of selenate to soluble species such as selenite or selenide38 that were
22 not adsorbed.

42 Given the multiple phenomena occurring simultaneously in the investigated GR-Se systems (e.g. simple
43
adsorption, homogenous/heterogeneous redox reaction), it would be interesting to assess the relationship
44
45 between them and their contribution on the overall Se removal and kinetics. For this purpose, the kinetics of the
46 redox reaction between GR and selenite/selenate were compared with the above described pseudo-second order
47 model describing the overall removal kinetics. In this work, the kinetics of the redox reactions was determined
48 based on GR concentration profiles from XAFS analysis (Fig. 8). GR concentration profiles were preferred over
49 the concentration profiles of Se(IV) and Se(VI) since the latest ones depend upon adsorption phenomena.
50 The reaction between GR and selenite/selenate was assumed to be a bimolecular first order reaction to both GR
51 and selenite/selenate, thus an overall second order reaction of the type (10):
52
A + B <U+2192> Products (10)
53
54 Unlike previous research works where the concentration of GR was set in large stoichiometric excess to the
55 targeted species39, in this work GR and selenite/selenate were used in the stoichiometric ratio. Under this
56 condition, the second order reaction in (10) can be conveniently treated as a second order reaction to GR40.
57 Accordingly:

31
The good correlation of the fitting lines in Fig. 10 confirmed the suitability of the overall second order reaction
32
33 model to describe the reduction of Se species by GR. Fitting results in Table 4 confirmed as the redox reaction
34 between GR and selenium species became faster at pH 9. The difference between the pseudo-second order
35 removal kinetics in Table 3 and the second-order redox reaction rate constants in Table 4 highlighted that simple
36 adsorption was always the fastest removal mechanism. Comparing the rate parameters also suggested that the
37 immobilization of selenium became slower after GR oxidized. Although the redox reactions are slower than
38 adsorption and do not affect significantly the overall removal kinetics, knowing their rate parameters could be
39 important for the management of end-products. Longer contact times would promote the formation of more
40
crystalline solids (e.g. goethite, Se0) exhibiting a better solid-liquid separability41. In contrast, shorter times
41
42 would lead to a presumably weaker immobilization of selenate by simple adsorption. As a consequence, the
43 selenium immobilized for shorter reaction times could be released more easily from the disposed sludge.

5. Conclusion
This study confirmed the ability of GR to remove selenite and selenate from water, and provided useful
48
49 information towards the elucidation of the removal mechanism. The immobilization of selenium species by GR
50 occurred through different phenomena depending on pH and Se species. Selenite could be removed from water
51 to a larger extent than selenate. The immobilization occurred via simple adsorption at pH 8, and via adsorption-
52 reduction with formation of Se0 and goethite at pH 9. The removal of selenate involved the redox reaction with
53 GR at both pH 8 and 9. In the process, GR oxidized mainly to goethite but also to magnetite, while selenate was
54 reduced to selenite and Se0. The concentration profiles from XAFS results suggested that the redox reaction
55 between GR and Se species occurred upon adsorption (homogenous redox reaction) and without adsorption
56
(heterogeneous redox reaction). However, simple adsorption was found to be always the fastest removal
57
58 mechanism.
59 Although the redox reaction affects Se removal and removal kinetics to a lesser extent than adsorption, the
60 contact time between GR and selenite/selenate shall be increased to obtain a more efficient immobilization of Se
species and the formation more crystalline products.

25 1. Summary
26
27 This work investigated the removal of selenite and selenate from water by sulfate-green rust (GR). Selenite was
28 immobilized by simple adsorption onto GR at pH 8, and by adsorption-reduction at pH 9. Selenate was
29
immobilized by adsorption-reduction to selenite and by direct reduction to Se0 at both pH 8 and 9. In the process,
30
31 GR oxidized to goethite and magnetite. The removal of selenite and selenate by GR was kinetically described
32 through a pseudo-second order model based on inductively-coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP) results. XAFS
33 analysis enabled to elucidate the concentration profiles of Se and Fe species in the solid phase and allowed to
34 distinguish two removal mechanism, namely adsorption and reduction. Selenite and selenate were reduced by
35 GR through homogeneous solid-phase reaction upon adsorption and by heterogeneous reaction at the solid-
36 liquid interface. The selenite reduced through heterogeneous reduction with GR was adsorbed onto GR but not
37 reduced further. The redox reaction between GR and selenite/selenate was kinetically described through an
38
irreversible second order bimolecular reaction model based on XAFS concentration profiles. Although the redox
39
40 reaction became faster at pH 9, simple adsorption was always the fastest removal mechanism.

2. Introduction
45 Selenium is an essential element for humans but becomes carcinogenic and teratogenic at high concentrations 1,2.
46 It commonly exists under four oxidation states, among which Se(IV) as selenite (SeO32-) and Se(VI) as selenate
47 (SeO42-) are the most stable species in water. Water pollution by selenate and selenite arises mostly from
48 anthropic activities such as agricultural practices3, power generation4 and mining5. Therefore, given the large
49 amount of water involved in these activities, selenium pollution should not be underestimated.

The removal of SeO42- and SeO32- from water has been object of many research works. Biological methods under
51
anaerobic6, oxic7 and anoxic8 conditions were proven effective and sustainable but relatively slow. Adsorption
52
53 on carbon nanospheres9, ferrous hydroxide10, ettringite11 and barite12 were described as possible alternatives to
54 biological methods. However much research is still needed to achieve the efficiency and/or sustainability
55 required to implement real processes. Reduction with zero-valent iron was also proven as an efficient method8,13–
56 15. However, a large amount of zero-valent iron should be specifically added to the wastewater in order to reduce
57 and immobilize selenium species.

When the contaminated water contains already dissolved iron, an ideal alternative to externally-added
1 removing agents is the immobilization on green rust16. Green Rust (GR) is a mixed Fe(II)–Fe(III) hydroxide
2 compound with layered double hydroxide (LDH) structure 17. GR can be described through the formula [FeII(1-
3 x)FeIIIx(OH)2]x+[(x/n)An(mx/n)H2O]x, where A represents anions like chloride, carbonate18 or sulfate19,20. In GR,
4 Fe(II) and Fe(III) hydroxides units exhibit octahedral structure and occupy positively charged surface portions 21.
5
Water molecules and anions are instead located in the interlayer between Fe(II)-Fe(III) octahedra to balance the
6
7 charge22. Due to the presence of Fe(II) on the surface, GR exhibits reducing strength that can be conveniently
8 utilized to reduce oxidized contaminants such as nitrate 23, chromate24 and arsenic anions25,26.
9 GR has also showed an interesting activity in the immobilization of selenate from water. Refait et al. (2000)
10 described the intercalation of selenate into GR’s interlayer27. However, authors did not assess the reducing
11 capability of GR and its fate upon intercalation. Hayashi et al. (2009) highlighted that GR can adsorb and reduce
12 selenate to Se0, oxidizing itself to goethite and/or magnetite depending on the pH. Authors speculated about the
13 simultaneous reduction of selenate to selenite and Se 0 but did not provide any specific evidence about it28.
14
Moreover, neither the reactions pathway nor the removal kinetics have been elucidated, while there are no
15
16 information at all about the possibility to remove selenite.
17 This study addressed the removal of selenite and selenite at pH 8 and 9 by sulfate-GR. Sulfate-GR was selected
18 over other types of GRs because the sulfate ion is often available in wastewaters contaminated by selenium (e.g.
19 acid mine drainage). Batch removal experiments were carried out to investigate the evolution of selenium and
20 iron species during removal along with the removal kinetics. An approach based on ICP and XAFS analysis was
21 used to elucidate the evolution of Se(IV), Se(VI) and Fe species, clarify the reactions pathway and assess the
22 contribution of adsorption and reduction to the overall Se removal kinetics.

3. Materials and Methods
28
29 3.1 Preparation of Green Rust
30 GR was prepared within a glove box (UN-650L, UNICO LTD, Japan) under Ar atmosphere to prevent oxidation.
31 All solutions were prepared using distilled and ion exchanged water (Aquarius RFD 240NA, ADVANTEC,
32 JAPAN) and were flushed with Ar gas to remove the dissolved oxygen prior to use. The GR precursor solution
33 was prepared dissolving FeSO4<U+F09E>7H2O and Fe2(SO4)3<U+F09E>nH2O in the ratio Fe(II)/Fe(III) = 0.75 up to achieve a total
34 Fe concentration of 22.3 g/L. The solution was then titrated with 8 M NaOH (addition speed: 2.3×10 -7 dm3/min)
35
up to reach pH 7.5. GR was separated from the obtained slurry by centrifugation (Himac CR21, HITACHI,
36
JAPAN) at 1000 G for 10 minutes and washed with ion-exchanged-distilled and de-oxygenated water for three
37
38 times. After washing, the GR precipitate was re-suspended in de-oxygenated water, and later used as it was in
39 removal experiments.
40
41 3.2 Selenium removal experiments
42 Removal experiments were conducted adding the GR suspension to the aqueous solutions containing Se up to
43 reach a total Fe concentration of 2000 mg/L. The Se concentration was set at 500 mg/L while the pH was adjusted
44
to 8 or 9. Experiments were conducted under open air atmosphere, for 2 hours under magnetic stirring (300
45
rpm) and constant pH. During the experiments, the suspensions were continuously flushed with Ar gas to limit
46
47 the concentration of dissolved oxygen. An automatic titrator (TS-2000, HIRANUMA SANGYO, Japan) adding
48 0.5 M NaOH was used to compensate for the pH decrease during the experiments. The redox potential was
49 continuously monitored through an ORP electrode (D-75, HORIBA, Japan).
50
51 3.3 Analysis
52 The concentration of Se in solution was determined by inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission
53
spectrometry (ICP-AES, SPS7800, SEIKO INSTUMENT, Japan) after filtration. The phase composition and
54
crystal structure of solid products from removal experiments were determined by x-ray diffraction (Geiger flex
55
56 RAD-IX, RIGAKU, Japan) with a copper target (CuKa) a crystal graphite monochromator and a scintillation
57 detector. The X-ray source was operated at 40 kV and 30 mA with step scanning from 2<U+03B8> values of 2 to 80°,
58 sequential increments of 0.02° and a scan speed of 2°/min. To avoid the oxidation of samples between
59 experiments and analysis, the collected paste samples were mixed with glycerol and transferred to the XRD
60 chamber29. The concentration of Fe(II) was determined through the Phenanthroline method and UV-Vis analysis
(DR5400, HACH, USA). The total Fe(T-Fe) was determined by Phenanthroline method upon Fe(III) reduction

2 with hydroxylammonium chloride. A transmission electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive probe
3
(TEM-EDS, HF-2200, HITACHI, Japan) was utilized to determine size and morphology of solid products. Image
4
5 mapping was applied to the same micrographs to identify the distribution of Fe and Se in the solid phase. For
6 this purpose, samples were set on an elastic carbon support film (STEM 100 Cu grid, grid pitch 100 µm,
7 OKENSHOJI, Japan) drying directly from the Ar purged glove box after vacuum drying. The Se K-edge and Fe
8 K-edge X-ray adsorption fine structure (XAFS) were performed at the BL5S1 beamline of the Aichi Synchrotron
9 Radiation Center (Aichi Science and Technology Foundation, Japan). The pellets for XAFS analysis were
10 prepared through vacuum drying, grinding, and mixing with boron nitride 30 in the Ar purged glove box after
11 solid liquid separation of the slurry.

39 Results highlighted that selenite was removed to a larger extent at pH 8, whereas the largest removal of selenate
40 was observed at pH 9. In the experiments with selenite, the Se concentration rapidly decreased upon contact
41 with GR. However, while at pH 8 Se concentration reached a plateau after the first dramatic decrease, at pH 9
42 selenium re-dissolved. Following this re-dissolution, the concentration of Se in solution started decreasing again
43 at a clearly lower rate. This trend suggested that two different phenomena with probably different rates might
44
be involved in the removal of selenium by GR. In the experiments with Se(VI), Se concentration exhibited similar
45
profiles but with a smoother initial decrease. Furthermore, the best removal performance was observed at pH
46
47 9. The larger removal of selenate at pH 9 is contrasting with what reported by Hayashi et al. (2009), who
48 described pH 7.5 as the best condition to remove Se(VI) in the pH range 7-10. To elucidate this aspect, the trends
49 of sulfate concentration and Fe2+/total Fe molar ratio (Fe2+/T-Fe) in solution were continuously monitored during
50 the experiments. Results are shown in Fig.2a and 2b. Fig. 3 shows the redox potential (vs SHE) measured during
51 removal experiments and the cumulative addition of NaOH to titrate the system.

31
32 The initial Fe2+/T-Fe ratio in GR was 0.66, very close to the ideal ratio reported in literature31,32. This ratio
33 progressively decreased in all experiments, beside the one with Se(IV) at pH 8. The decreasing Fe2+/T-Fe ratio
34 was a clear suggestion that GR was being oxidized while removing selenite and/or selenate. Accordingly, SO 42-
35
was released in solution following GR oxidation (Fig. 2b). Both trends were in general more pronounced at pH
36
37 9. In contrast, the Fe2+/T-Fe ratio was nearly constant in the experiment with selenite at pH 8, though the removal
38 of selenium was the largest. This evidence revealed as selenite at pH 8 was removed from solution without
39 reduction. The very low amount of sulfate released in the same experiment can be considered as an evidence
40 that selenite was removed by simple adsorption onto GR. In fact, if the immobilization occurred via intercalation
41 in GR interlayer, the sulfate release should be stoichiometric to selenite in order to maintain the charge balance
42 within GR. Like in the experiments at pH 8, the concentration of dissolved Se decreased rapidly upon contact
43 with GR also at pH 9, thus suggesting a quick adsorption onto GR. However, at pH 9 selenite re-dissolved again
44
after the initial removal. Given the decreasing Fe2+/T-Fe ratio and the release of SO42-, it is possible that about
45
46 50% of the selenite initially adsorbed was released due to GR oxidation.
47 The above mentioned consideration were supported also by the redox potential in solution (Fig. 3b). In all
48 experiments, the redox potential sharply decreased upon adding GR to the selenite/selenate solutions. The
49 polarization at lower potentials revealed as the system became electrochemically controlled by the redox
50 couples Fe3+/Fe2+ and SeO42-/SeO32-. Following the initial sharp polarization, the potential started decreasing
51 again but slowly due to reduction of selenite/selenate. The slow decrease was not observed in the experiment
52 with Se(IV) at pH 8, as a further proof that selenite was removed via simple adsorption. In contrast, the largest
53
Eh decrease was observed in the experiments with selenate at pH 9, as also expected from the Fe 2+/T-Fe trend.
54
55 This evidence was a further indication that (i) selenate was easier to reduce that selenite, and that (ii) pH 9
56 favored the redox reaction.

22 The XRD patterns in Fig. 4 exhibited the typical peaks of goethite and magnetite under all investigated
23
conditions except for Se(IV) at pH 8. Although selenium species were not detected, the only presence of GR in
24
25 the XRD pattern of the solid residue from the experiment with selenite at pH 8 confirmed the removal via
26 adsorption. The presence of Se in all residual solids was confirmed by FE-TEM-EDX analysis and image
27 mapping (Fig. 5). In the TEM micrographs, the hexagonal flakes corresponded to GR22 while the rods observed
28 in the other experiments could be either magnetite or goethite33, in agreement with XRD results. The solid
29 residue from the experiment with selenite at pH 9 exhibited yellow spherical particles, most likely
30 corresponding to Se0. On the other hand, the solid residues from the experiments with selenate exhibited also
31 yellow portions with elongated shape, suggesting the presence of selenite adsorbed onto magnetite and/or
32
goethite.

31 The Se k-edge XANES and the EXAFS function k3<U+03C7>(k) spectra of the solid residue from the experiment with
32 Se(IV) at pH 8 revealed the only presence of selenite and GR, as also expected from the above described results.
33 In contrast, Se(IV), Se0, GR and goethite were confirmed in the solid residue at pH 9. Fitting results highlighted
34
as about 25% of selenite was reduced to Se0 at the expenses of GR, which oxidized to goethite as in (1):
35
36 Fe4Fe2(OH)12SO4 + SeO32- <U+2192> 6FeOOH(s) + SO42- + Se0 + 3H2O (1)
37
XAFS results from the experiment with selenate at pH 8 exhibited multiple peaks around 12652, 12657 and 12659
38
39 eV. These peaks revealed the presence of Se 0 and Se(IV) in the solid residue. The EXAFS function k 3<U+03C7>(k) of the
40 same sample revealed the conversion of about 29% GR to 22% goethite and about 7% magnetite. Clearly,
41 selenate was reduced to selenite and Se0 using the electrons generated from the oxidation of GR to goethite and
42 magnetite an as in (2)-(5).

51
52 Given the solubility of selenite, the presence of Se(IV) in the solid residues revealed as the selenite formed from
53 reduction of selenate was adsorbed by GR and/or iron products. Nevertheless, it was not possible to understand
54 whether selenite was adsorbed upon heterogeneous reduction between GR and selenate, or if it was generated
55 from already adsorbed selenate that remained adsorbed after reduction. This aspect will be discussed in section
56 3.4.
57 Increasing the removal pH from 8 to 9 resulted into a more pronounced reduction of selenate to Se 0. As a
58
consequence of the larger amount of exchanged electrons, more GR oxidized to goethite (64%) and magnetite
59
60 (18%). The significantly positive effect of pH on the extent of redox reaction is consistent with the stoichiometry
of reactions (2)-(5) as hydroxyl ions are required for the reaction to take place. The simultaneous reduction of
selenate to both goethite and magnetite is contrasting with results reported by Hayashi et al. (2009) and Myneni

2 et al., 1997, who described the preferential formation of magnetite at pH 9 35. The difference might be due to the
3
different experimental conditions used in this work (e.g. constant pH through addition of NaOH, lower Fe/Se
4
5 molar ratio).
6
7 4.4 Reaction pathway and kinetics
8 Since the immobilization of selenium involved the adsorption and/or reduction of Se species on GR surface, the
9 kinetic analysis of Se removal was performed using a pseudo-second order model36. According to the model,
10 the adsorption rate is proportional to the second power of the sites available for adsorption/reaction37 as in (6):
11
<U+0001D41D><U+0001D42A><U+0001D42D>
12 = <U+0001D424>(<U+0001D42A><U+0001D41E> - <U+0001D42A><U+0001D42D> )<U+0001D7D0> (6)
13 <U+0001D41D><U+0001D42D>
14 Where qe and qt are the sorption densities at time t and equilibrium, determined respectively as in (7) and (8):
15 (<U+0001D402><U+0001D422> - <U+0001D402><U+0001D41E> )<U+0001D415>
16 <U+0001D42A><U+0001D41E> = (7)
<U+0001D40C>
17
18 (<U+0001D402><U+0001D422> - <U+0001D402><U+0001D42D> )<U+0001D415>
19 <U+0001D42A><U+0001D42D> = (8)
<U+0001D40C>
20
In (7) and (8), <U+0001D436><U+0001D456> , <U+0001D436><U+0001D452> and <U+0001D436><U+0001D461> [mmol/L] are the concentrations of Se(IV) or Se(VI) at initial, equilibrium and time t,
21
22 respectively. M is the mass of T-Fe [g] calculated from the formula of GR, V is the volume of solution [L] and k
23 is the adsorption rate constant. For the boundary conditions t = 0 to t = t and qt, the integrated form of equation
24 (6) becomes like in (9):
25 <U+0001D42D> <U+0001D7CF> <U+0001D7CF>
26 = <U+0001D42D>+ <U+0001D7D0> (9)
<U+0001D42A><U+0001D42D> <U+0001D42A><U+0001D41E> <U+0001D42A><U+0001D41E> <U+0001D424>
27
28 Accordingly, if the removal reaction follows a pseudo-second order kinetics, the experimental points plotted as
29 t/qt vs time align through a straight line with slope 1/qe and intercept 1/qe2k. The plots of t/qt vs time are shown
30 in Fig. 7. Fitting parameters from Fig. 7 are listed in Table 2.

59 The good fitting from Fig. 7 highlighted the suitability of the pseudo-second order model to describe the
60 removal of selenite and selenate by GR at pH 8 and 9. The removal rate constant was the highest in the
experiment with selenite at pH 8, thus highlighting that simple adsorption was the fastest removal mechanism.
Increasing the pH from 8 to 9 promoted the redox reaction between selenite and GR. As a consequence, the

kinetics was slower because GR structure was destroyed and the adsorbed selenite was released in solution. In
1 contrast, the removal of selenate was the fastest at pH 9, condition that determined also the most pronounced

47
48 From the graphs in Fig. 8, it was clear that selenite was adsorbed onto GR and/or reduced to Se0 upon adsorption.
49 The concentration profiles also suggested a fast adsorption of the initial Se(IV) and Se(VI) followed by their
50 (slower) redox reactions to Se0 (Fig. 8b) and Se(IV) and/or Se0 (fig. 8d and 8f), respectively. The first interesting
51 point to note is the concentration profile of Se(VI) in the solid phase. Although for practical reasons the first
52 sample for XAFS analysis was taken 5 minutes after realizing the contact Se-GR, the Se(VI) concentration must
53 be clearly 0 before contact (time 0). Therefore, the concentration of Se(VI) must have reached a maximum at t =
54
5 minutes before being consumed. This was a clear evidence that selenate was quickly adsorbed onto GR, as
55
initially suggested by Fig. 1. Following the adsorption, Se(VI) was reduced to Se(IV) and/or Se 0. However, Fig.
56
57 8b-8d-8f revealed also as the concentrations of reduced selenium species (Se 0 in the experiment with selenite,
58 Se(IV) and Se0 in the experiment with selenate) were still decreasing after all initially adsorbed Se was consumed.
59 This evidence suggested two considerations. First, not only the adsorbed selenite/selenate could be reduced by
60 GR (homogenous reaction) but also their dissolved counterparts upon contact with GR (heterogeneous reaction).
Moreover, because selenite is soluble, the presence of Se(IV) in the solid phase could be explained only by
considering the adsorption of the selenite formed by heterogeneous reaction between GR and selenate. In this
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos R. Soc. open sci.
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 10 of 13
view, the slow removal of Se following the initial large concentration drop observed in Fig. 1 must be the main
1 consequence of the heterogeneous redox reaction. Another interesting point to note is the simultaneous
2 reduction of selenate to selenite and Se0 (Fig. 8d-8f). Although the reduction of selenate could be described by a
3 series of two irreversible reductions (e.g.to selenite first and, in turn, to Se0), the monotonic trend of Se(IV) was
4 more consistent with a parallel reduction of the adsorbed selenate to adsorbed selenite and/or Se0. In other
5
words, the adsorbed selenite could not be reduced further to Se0. This evidence might be caused by the depletion
6
7 of Fe(II) in the proximity of the Fe(III) adsorption sites due to reduction of selenate to selenite. A similar
8 consideration can be proposed based on the concentration profiles of Fe species. The monotonic trends of GR,
9 magnetite and goethite suggested that GR oxidized either to magnetite or to goethite, whereas the oxidation of
10 magnetite to goethite did not occur.
11 Based on GR consumption (XAFS results), amount of precipitated iron, selenium removed (ICP results) and the
12 stoichiometry of redox reactions (2)-(5), an electron balance was carried out to assess the efficiency of GR to
13 reduce Se(IV) and Se(VI). The relationship between electrons produced through GR oxidation and electrons
14
used in the reduction of Se(IV) and Se(VI) is shown in Fig, 9. The linear correlation with unitary slope shown in
15
16 Fig. 9 confirmed the effectiveness of GR in the reduction of selenite at pH 9 and selenate at both pH 8 and 9. The
17 slight positive deviation observed from 0.010 mol/dm 3 (condition corresponding to the experimental points at
18 90 and 120 minutes) in the experiments with Se(VI) at pH 9 revealed that some of the electrons from GR were
19 not used to reduce selenate. There are two possible explanations for the observed deviation. One is the partial
20 unwanted oxidation of GR by air, though Ar gas was continuously bubbled into the reacting system. Another
21 possible explanation involves the reduction of selenate to soluble species such as selenite or selenide38 that were
22 not adsorbed.

42 Given the multiple phenomena occurring simultaneously in the investigated GR-Se systems (e.g. simple
43
adsorption, homogenous/heterogeneous redox reaction), it would be interesting to assess the relationship
44
45 between them and their contribution on the overall Se removal and kinetics. For this purpose, the kinetics of the
46 redox reaction between GR and selenite/selenate were compared with the above described pseudo-second order
47 model describing the overall removal kinetics. In this work, the kinetics of the redox reactions was determined
48 based on GR concentration profiles from XAFS analysis (Fig. 8). GR concentration profiles were preferred over
49 the concentration profiles of Se(IV) and Se(VI) since the latest ones depend upon adsorption phenomena.
50 The reaction between GR and selenite/selenate was assumed to be a bimolecular first order reaction to both GR
51 and selenite/selenate, thus an overall second order reaction of the type (10):
52
A + B <U+2192> Products (10)
53
54 Unlike previous research works where the concentration of GR was set in large stoichiometric excess to the
55 targeted species39, in this work GR and selenite/selenate were used in the stoichiometric ratio. Under this
56 condition, the second order reaction in (10) can be conveniently treated as a second order reaction to GR40.
57 Accordingly:

31
The good correlation of the fitting lines in Fig. 10 confirmed the suitability of the overall second order reaction
32
33 model to describe the reduction of Se species by GR. Fitting results in Table 4 confirmed as the redox reaction
34 between GR and selenium species became faster at pH 9. The difference between the pseudo-second order
35 removal kinetics in Table 3 and the second-order redox reaction rate constants in Table 4 highlighted that simple
36 adsorption was always the fastest removal mechanism. Comparing the rate parameters also suggested that the
37 immobilization of selenium became slower after GR oxidized. Although the redox reactions are slower than
38 adsorption and do not affect significantly the overall removal kinetics, knowing their rate parameters could be
39 important for the management of end-products. Longer contact times would promote the formation of more
40
crystalline solids (e.g. goethite, Se0) exhibiting a better solid-liquid separability41. In contrast, shorter times
41
42 would lead to a presumably weaker immobilization of selenate by simple adsorption. As a consequence, the
43 selenium immobilized for shorter reaction times could be released more easily from the disposed sludge.

5. Conclusion
This study confirmed the ability of GR to remove selenite and selenate from water, and provided useful
48
49 information towards the elucidation of the removal mechanism. The immobilization of selenium species by GR
50 occurred through different phenomena depending on pH and Se species. Selenite could be removed from water
51 to a larger extent than selenate. The immobilization occurred via simple adsorption at pH 8, and via adsorption-
52 reduction with formation of Se0 and goethite at pH 9. The removal of selenate involved the redox reaction with
53 GR at both pH 8 and 9. In the process, GR oxidized mainly to goethite but also to magnetite, while selenate was
54 reduced to selenite and Se0. The concentration profiles from XAFS results suggested that the redox reaction
55 between GR and Se species occurred upon adsorption (homogenous redox reaction) and without adsorption
56
(heterogeneous redox reaction). However, simple adsorption was found to be always the fastest removal
57
58 mechanism.
59 Although the redox reaction affects Se removal and removal kinetics to a lesser extent than adsorption, the
60 contact time between GR and selenite/selenate shall be increased to obtain a more efficient immobilization of Se
species and the formation more crystalline products.

Appendix C
The manuscript “Kinetics and mechanism of selenate and selenite removal in solution by
sulfate-green rust” (RSOS-181464) presents interest study about the Se removal using
sulfate-green rust. I would say this study present high quality data to support their
conclusion. The manuscript is generally well written and easy to understand. Since the
adsorption and reduction of Se by GRs might be complicated, the author tried to make
sufficient discussion to reveal the Se removal mechanism. I think this paper could be
published with minor revision.
We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments. We addressed them all through
modifications of the manuscript and by specific answers here.
Specific Comments:
1. Intorduction P2, L1-2: “When the contaminated water contains already dissolved iron,
an ideal alternative to externally-added removing agents is the immobilization on green
rust”. I think there should be other reasons to use GRs, such as the easy production using
novel methods (reference 22) , cheap price but high reducing capacity.
The information have been added as suggested by the reviewer.
2. Preparation of Green Rust: please add some references to support the synthesis
methods.
We added a reference to support the synthesis method. We are also open to further
specific suggestions if the reviewer has any.
3. Is it possible to merge Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 in one column? They can share the same X
axis.
Unfortunately this is very difficult because Fig.2 contains already two figures and
it would not be symmetrical if we add a third one.
4. P4, L55: “selenate was easier to reduce that selenite”, “that” should be “than”?
Yes, it was corrected.
5. Fig 8 seems to repeatedly present the data in Table 3.
Table 3 was moved to supporting material.
6. Fig. 10 should be removed since the author provides data in Table 4.
Actually, Table 4 lists the fitting parameters from Fig. 10. Estimating the fitting
parameters of Fig. 10 just by looking at it would be impossible.
7. I think the authors have present sufficient data in this study, however, the discussion
could be improve by separating the results and discussion, so that the highlights can be
emphasized in the discussion. It might be a good way to make the logic clearer when the
authors have much data to present.
We agree with the reviewer and added a discussion section accordingly.

Comments to the Author(s)
General comments
This study reports an experimental study of removal of selenite and selenate from water
by green rust (GR) for understanding of the interaction between selenite/selenate and
GR. The authors presented the original research from an experimental study on the
synthesized GR and applied this material to the treatment of selenite/selenate in
hydrosphere. Whilst the subject of this study is not novel and several earlier studies
reported similar investigations, the work of Onoguchi and coworkers investigated the
mechanism of sorption and reduction process. I appreciate that the authors have
applied EXAFS and various techniques to investigate mechanism. I think that the paper
can be improved after revising. However, I recommend a somewhat revision prior to
publication in R. Soc. Open Sci.
We thank the reviewer for taking the time to provide insightful comments that will
improve the quality of our manuscript. The answer to his/her comments are provided
below while the modifications to the manuscript can be found highlighted in green color.
Specific comments
1) The details on TEM-EDS operation parameters should be mentioned, such as
accelerating voltage.
The information about accelerating voltage is now contained in the experimental
section.
2) Add specifications of the beamline (energy range of BL5S1, detectors, optical
system).
The specifications of the beamline are now included in the experimental section.
3) The detailed analysis procedure of EXAFS should be described in the
manuscript.
We added further information about EXAFS analysis.
4) P3L52: I think authors made mistake on pKa2 of selenite. The pKa2 of selenite
should be 8.32 and this should influence the discussion of selenite sorption and
discussion. Additional considerations about the influence of the pKa were added when
answering comment 7.
Yes, we thank the reviewer for noticing it. The pKa2 of selenite was corrected.
5) For Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, the GR seems to convert into goethite and magnetite after
reaction with Se(IV) under pH 9. However, the dissolved sulfate concentration did not
increase. Could authors interpret this? Where is the sulfate?
Apart from the experiment with Se(IV) at pH 8, where GR was not oxidized and sulfate
was not released (Fig. 3b), GR was always partially oxidized. Following the oxidation, a
proportional amount of sulfate was released in solution. In fact, the oxidation of GR
accounted for about 30% in the experiments with Se(IV) at pH 9 and Se(VI) at pH 9,
and for about 80% in the experiment with Se(VI) at pH 9 (Table 1). Accordingly the
sulfate release was the largest with Se(VI) at pH 9 (about 200 mg/L), whereas a similar
release (about 100 mg/L) was observed in the experiments with Se(IV) at pH 9 and
Se(VI) at pH 8. This trend also matched with the observed Fe(II)/FeT (Fig. 3a).
6) The formula of goethite and magnetite should be given in the manuscript.
The formula of goethite and magnetite were added to abstract and manuscript the first
time they were mentioned.
7) Under pH 8, the sorption mechanisms of selenite/selenate should be different based
on Fig. 3. Some discussion can be added in this part.
The following comment was added to the manuscript to describe the different behavior
of selenite and selenate at pH 8.
If the different pH-dependent behaviour can be explained considering that higher pH
favour more the redox reactions, the different behaviour of selenite and selenite at the
same pH (pH 8) must be explained considering how prone these two species are to
adsorption onto GR. Indeed, selenite is smaller than selenite and more negatively
charged because completely deprotonated at pH 8. Therefore, a larger removal of
selenite by simple adsorption could be somehow expected. In contrast, the reduction of
selenate at the same pH was more pronounced, as highlighted by the larger decrease
of Fe2+/T-Fe ratio and sulfate release. This evidence could be reasonably explained
considering the thermodynamic advantage associated with the reduction of a more
oxidized anions as SeO42-.
8) For Fig. 5, why the particle size of reduced Se is different for selenite/selenite?
Since the reduction of selenate was actually faster, a possible explanation for this
evidence is the presence of two different reducing mechanisms. It is possible that
homogeneous and heterogeneous reductions determined different steric-electrostatic
situations around the adsorbed-reduced and reduced particles. As a consequence, the
reduced particles grew to a different extent.
We apologize but at this moment we do not have enough information to provide as
evidence of this consideration.

Comments to the Author(s)
This resubmitted article by Onoguchi et al, describes the removal of selenite and
selenate through processes involving adsorption or reduction by green rust.
The authors have done a good job improving the language and addressing major
reviewer comments. I only have one comment:
Line 55-56: “The total volume was set to reach a total Fe concentration of 0.036 mol/L
(2000 mg/L). The Se concentration was set at 500 mg/L while the pH was adjusted to 8
or 9 by adding 0.25 M NaOH. While the synthesis of GR was conducted inside a
glovebox, removal experiments were conducted in a separable flask under open air
atmosphere, for 2 hours under magnetic stirring (300 rpm) and constant pH. During the
experiments, the suspensions were continuously purged with Ar gas to limit the
concentration of dissolved oxygen”
I suggest the following alternative text to resolve the confusion with your ‘open air’
statement:
Removal experiments were conducted by adding the GR suspension to the aqueous
solutions containing Se. The suspension was mixed by magnetic stirring (300 rpm) and
purged continuously with Ar gas to limit the concentration of dissolved oxygen. The total
volume was set to reach a total Fe concentration of 0.036 mol/L (2000 mg/L).
The Se concentration was set at 500 mg/L while the pH was adjusted to 8 or 9 by
adding 0.25 M NaOH. An automatic titrator (TS-2000, HIRANUMA SANGYO, Japan)
adding 0.5 M NaOH was used to compensate for the pH decrease during the
experiments. The redox potential was continuously monitored through an ORP
electrode (D-75, HORIBA, Japan).
We thank the reviewer for suggesting the sentence. The new one is definitely better.
