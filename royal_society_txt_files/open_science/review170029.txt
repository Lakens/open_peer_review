This study examines the development of the tendency to choose social stimuli over non-social
ones. This question is instrumentalized using a task in which participants choose, at each trial,
between two short videoclips: either one that depicts a person smiling or one that shows a
moving object. The dependent variables are the proportion of times a participant will choose the
social stimulus (over 60 trials), as well as the “effort” she is willing to deploy, operationalized as
the number of mouse clicks used to launch the movie. The authors tested participants ranging
from 4 to 20 years of age. The data indicate that participants are more likely to choose a movie
with a social context than a movie depicting only objects. This effect varies with age, however, in
a, apparently, quadratic manner: decreasing between childhood and the beginning of adolescence
and then increasing again from middle to the end of adolescence. The authors discuss the
implications in terms of defining age-dependant norms for social motivation, against which
pathological groups could be compared.
This is an important topic, with a sound design and the data deserve certainly to be published.
However I find that the manuscript in its current form is somewhat difficult to follow due to
some imprecisions and thus could be substantially improved.
First the introduction should be improved by stressing more clearly the developmental
hypothesis or question with regards social motivation and its link to social rewards. The
description of previous literature would be illuminated if it started with a definition or at least a
description of what others have considered a social reward vs a non-social reward. Also the
references to previous studies present some inaccuracies or imprecisions. More specifically:
-line 58: While Carey (1980) and a few others effectively observe a dip in face recognition abilities
around puberty, Lawrence et al 2008, do not replicate this finding (also accordingly they do
report a non monotonic developmental trajectory with a slowdown at the beginning of
adolescence). A number of other studies also report no dip in development (eg Itier and ?? 2004)
Ref 4 (Ross, 2012) concerns emotion recognition from body not facial movements, and does not
really report a dip either.
- l 61: cognitive and information processing development is not really described. Would
be interesting to explore how it is related to social abilities development.
- L 70-81: the specificity of social context/ stimuli in relation to reward is not clear at all.
This paragraph should be rephrased.
- L 88-90: Likewise, how the SID task is indeed social should be described more clearly.
- The presentation of data by cohort is a bit confusing as text description and table do not
perfectly match. This might be a detail but the methods would read better if age groups refered to
cohorts expliciely. I.e l 165: Participants age (4-11 (cohorts 2 and 5), etc...
- -l 174: how was sample size determined by cohort?
- L. 176: what exlcusion criteria were set?
Analysis: which statistical package or softawre was used to perform the statistical analyses
- It would be informative to explicitly write the model tested. It is not clear how it is a
mixed-level model nor why participants ID is considered a between subject variable (should this
be cohort?) and not a random factor. In addition to the Wald statistics it could be interesting to
compare different models, for instance to test directly whether the quadratic model fits the data
better than the linear one.
- I don’t really understand why the two alternative analyses are conducted and what
additional information they bring. More explanation on this issue would be helpful. The “change
point “ analysis is not really clear. Is this the same as piecewise regression? What is MSE (how is
it computed?). If the goal is to test point of maximal dip, why not use directly the coefficients
from the regression analysis to compute it?
3
- Overall it is not really clear to me which of the models tested is the best fit to the data.
- Discussion: how is pre-adolescence defined? Could puberty also have an effect on social
seeking?
- I am not sure whether this is requirement of the journal or the author own initiative, but I
would rather see complete references rather than just weblinks.... A few typos in the reference
list. Ref 25 and 26 are identical

1. I very much like the careful conceptualization of social seeking and the comprehensive
introduction of the literature. One thing, however, is a bit confusing: the age-course of social
seeking by itself versus the age-course of the preference of social over non-social stimuli. For
example, would it be possible that social seeking by itself increases with increasing age, while at
all ages non-social stimuli are still the preferred option? It would help the reader if the authors
could make a clear distinction between both types of analyses, or explain why they are two ways
of looking at the same phenomenon. The same applies to the first part of the Discussion (lines
337-34): instead of focusing on the age-course of social seeking by itself (as is the main focus of
the Data-analysis), the focus changes to the relative preference for social vs non-social stimuli.
2. The review of the empirical literature did not yield a consistent age pattern, hence the present
study aims were described as 'exploratory' (lines 154 & 156). Yet, in the Methods a specific data
analytic technique was used to to detect "the age of maximum dip in social preference". The
authors might want to forecast this more specific expectation at the end of the introduction.
3. In the findings it is reported that the maximum depth of social seeking was reached at 15 years
of age. The authors provide some explanation for the reduction in social seeking until 15 years of
age, but they fail to explain the increase after 15 years of age. What makes mid to late adolescents
4
more social seeking than early adolescents? Or is it mainly a matter of a temporary suppression
of social seeking in ealy adolescence?
4. The brain research is definitely worth mentioning (lines 70 - 83), but it seems out of place in the
introduction. It would, however, add to the scope of the discussion, as it could provide a partial
explanation for the dip in social seeking.
5. A few typo's should be corrected -- mostly of the singular vs. plural kind.

The manuscript is dealing with an interesting topic about the development of social seeking from
childhood to young adulthood. The authors succeed in including a large number of participants
with a wide age range and an even gender distribution. They use a clever paradigm, which has
been proven to measure social seeking adequately. Importantly, the paradigm appears to be
ideally suited to study effects across a wide age range which has not been investigated before but
is of great interest. However, some concerns arise over various aspects of the design, analyses,
and interpretation, which are detailed below.
Major comments:
• One major issue is the use of different cohorts which were tested under varying
circumstances. This introduces some potential confounds (biased samples, motivational issues
(e.g. different rewards for participation), attentional issues (e.g. “walking by” testing during a
public event), etc.). It is well taken that the authors make an effort to describe these aspects in
detail, however I think it is mandatory to give potential confounds more room in the discussion
(section about limitations), and (wherever possible) include additional analyses to estimate the
influence of these issues on the analyses, especially if there could be interactions with age.
One approach would be to include cohort (and probably age x cohort) effects as explanatory
variables to the statistical models if this is possible.
5
Alternatively, cohort effects (e.g. related to overall motivation or attention) could be approached
by comparing overall reaction times and variability measures between cohorts, or showing that
analyses within cohorts show similar trends as the whole dataset.
Table 1 should also include some bullet points about recruitment strategy of the various cohorts
(as detailed in the methods section) so the reader is able to evaluate these issues “at a glance”.
• Assessment of further potentially confounding variables. Is there any measure /
estimation of cognitive abilities / SES? E.g. it appears obvious that 18-20 year olds recruited at the
university may be a biased sample in terms of cognitive abilities or SES. Can you provide more
details about what kind of clinical condition or behavioral problem were exclusion criteria and
how these were assessed exactly? Were participants aged 18 years or older also checked for any
*history* of psychiatric conditions? For Instance, a history of anxiety disorders might influence
results. Please add potential issues to the limitations section.
• Different versions of the paradigms. On page 11, line 231ff it is mentioned that only
cohort 1 completed version 1, while all other cohorts completed version 2, which apparently was
slightly easier. Could you clarify why which version was used in which cohort? Furthermore, it
would be interesting to see whether results would change if cohort 1 was excluded. Cohort 1 and
4 could also be compared directly to each other to see whether there is an influence of version of
the paradigm. On line 234 it is stated that the versions differed “primarily” by … Please specify
all differences between paradigms, also mention briefly the additional conditions of version 1
which were not analyzed here.
• Touch screen vs. clicks. It is not entirely clear which participants used which version.
Please clarify. On page 10, line 218/219 the authors explain that participants could either respond
by pressing a key press or by touching the screen and that this depended on the age of the
participant. Could you please clarify how many participants responded by which option? Might
this influence the results or the interpretation of the results? Later on (page 11, line 234/235) the
authors mentioned that the response option depended on the version of the paradigm. This is in
conflict with what was stated earlier because also cohort 4 did version 2. Was the touch screen
option related to the paradigm version, the cohort, or the exact age of the participant?
• In the introduction (page 5, line 91ff) three studies are mentioned which examined social
seeking. However, an important aspect of two studies is missing that makes the results of both
studies less comparable than stated here. Kohls et al. compared two social stimuli with varying
valence with each other, social reward and social disapproval, but were less interested in
different types of stimuli (social, monetary etc.). Cox et al. on the other hand compared multiple
stimuli with each other, including control, non-social and social. Thus, results are not conflicting
(as implied) but shed light on different aspects of social seeking.
• Version 1 and 2 had the same number of total analyzed trials. Why did you chose to use
less familiarization trials for version 2 compared to version 1? Why was the distribution of trials
different between versions? Could this influence the results? Furthermore it is not mentioned
whether the described possibilities of lock distributions were counterbalanced for the type of
stimulus. In line 289 (results) it is stated that “levels of effort” were “balanced over trials”. What
does that mean? The issue of different lock distributions might be especially relevant for the basic
preference analysis.
• For the smaller children the experimenter remained at the desk to encourage the child to
complete the experiment (page 12, line 265/266). Isn’t this influencing the overall behavior of the
children? See also major comment related to cohort effects.
• Figure 2: A few participants seemed to have chosen the stimuli in 100% or 0% of the
trials. Can these participants be included in the study? It is difficult to argue with
preference/social seeking if the participants did not explore the different options but rather were
stuck with the same stimuli. Related: Were any other measures taken to exclude participants with
odd behavioral responses (especially those that completed the self-paced version of the paradigm
which was not “supervised” by the experimenter?)
• Results Basic Preference Analyses and Change point analyses: Could you clarify how the
results of both analyses can be combined, i.e. how differences between both analyses should be
interpreted? Specifically, the two different ages (11 and 15 years of age, respectively) which are
revealed by the two analyses?
6
• Discussion (page 16, 352/353): The authors give as one possible explanation of increased
social anxiety prevalence during adolescence. Do you have any measure on this for the current
sample to verify this hypothesis? Isn’t that a bit contradictory because children with behavioral
problems were excluded from participation?
Minor Comments:
• L 173: Please provide more information how the a-priori sample size for each cohort was
determined.
• There are quite a few typos in the manuscript. Please check the whole manuscript
thoroughly.
o page 5, line 79: the publication years is missing
o page 6, line 121 a typo; the space is missing
o page 7, line 132 a typo; measure needs to be changed to “measures”
o page 9, line 201 a typo; “places” needs to be changed to “placed”
o page 15, line 342 a typo: “means” needs to be changed to “mean”
o page 17, line 399: typo “fulfills”
• Please be consistent in either stating typical children or typically developing children.
This would increase the readability of the manuscript.
• On page 11, line 239 the authors state that the remaining 120 trials were reported
elsewhere. I am wondering whether the given reference (14) is correct.
• Figure 1: “1 sec. each lock” What does that mean and could you provide more detail
about that in the methods section or the figure caption?
• Figure 2: It seems that you used the exact age for participants between 4 and 16 years of
age, and only years in age for participants between 18 and 20 years of age. Is this just a
visualization issue or are these the raw data that entered into the analysis? Could that
differentially affect the sensitivity of regression analyses?
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to review this highly interesting manuscript!

This study examines the development of the tendency to choose social stimuli over non-social
ones. This question is instrumentalized using a task in which participants choose, at each trial,
between two short videoclips: either one that depicts a person smiling or one that shows a
moving object. The dependent variables are the proportion of times a participant will choose the
social stimulus (over 60 trials), as well as the “effort” she is willing to deploy, operationalized as
the number of mouse clicks used to launch the movie. The authors tested participants ranging
from 4 to 20 years of age. The data indicate that participants are more likely to choose a movie
with a social context than a movie depicting only objects. This effect varies with age, however, in
a, apparently, quadratic manner: decreasing between childhood and the beginning of adolescence
and then increasing again from middle to the end of adolescence. The authors discuss the
implications in terms of defining age-dependant norms for social motivation, against which
pathological groups could be compared.
This is an important topic, with a sound design and the data deserve certainly to be published.
However I find that the manuscript in its current form is somewhat difficult to follow due to
some imprecisions and thus could be substantially improved.
First the introduction should be improved by stressing more clearly the developmental
hypothesis or question with regards social motivation and its link to social rewards. The
description of previous literature would be illuminated if it started with a definition or at least a
description of what others have considered a social reward vs a non-social reward. Also the
references to previous studies present some inaccuracies or imprecisions. More specifically:

Ref 4 (Ross, 2012) concerns emotion recognition from body not facial movements, and does not
really report a dip either.

be interesting to explore how it is related to social abilities development.

interpreted? Specifically, the two different ages (11 and 15 years of age, respectively) which are
revealed by the two analyses?
• Discussion (page 16, 352/353): The authors give as one possible explanation of increased
social anxiety prevalence during adolescence. Do you have any measure on this for the current
sample to verify this hypothesis? Isn’t that a bit contradictory because children with behavioral
problems were excluded from participation?
Minor Comments:
• L 173: Please provide more information how the a-priori sample size for each cohort was
determined.
• There are quite a few typos in the manuscript. Please check the whole manuscript
thoroughly.
o page 5, line 79: the publication years is missing
o page 6, line 121 a typo; the space is missing
o page 7, line 132 a typo; measure needs to be changed to “measures”
o page 9, line 201 a typo; “places” needs to be changed to “placed”
o page 15, line 342 a typo: “means” needs to be changed to “mean”
o page 17, line 399: typo “fulfills”
• Please be consistent in either stating typical children or typically developing children.
This would increase the readability of the manuscript.
• On page 11, line 239 the authors state that the remaining 120 trials were reported
elsewhere. I am wondering whether the given reference (14) is correct.
12
• Figure 1: “1 sec. each lock” What does that mean and could you provide more detail
about that in the methods section or the figure caption?
• Figure 2: It seems that you used the exact age for participants between 4 and 16 years of
age, and only years in age for participants between 18 and 20 years of age. Is this just a
visualization issue or are these the raw data that entered into the analysis? Could that
differentially affect the sensitivity of regression analyses?
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to review this highly interesting manuscript!

Appendix A
We would like to thank all the reviewers for their valuable feedback and suggestions. A
detailed response to each point is given below:
Reviewer 1
1. First the introduction should be improved by stressing more clearly the
developmental hypothesis or question with regards social motivation and its link to
social rewards.
Authors response
We have added a paragraph in the introduction (please see line 134-144) describing possible
developmental hypotheses. However, this is an exploratory study and we do not want to
engage in HARKing, so we have not selected one specific hypothesis nor made claims that
we are testing one hypothesis.
2. The description of previous literature would be illuminated if it started with a
definition or at least a description of what others have considered a social reward vs
a non-social reward.
Authors response: We have now added description of the social and non-social rewards
used in most of the reported studies.
3. Also the references to previous studies present some inaccuracies or imprecisions.
More specifically: line 58: While Carey (1980) and a few others effectively observe a
dip in face recognition abilities around puberty, Lawrence et al 2008, do not replicate
this finding (also accordingly they do report a non-monotonic developmental
trajectory with a slowdown at the beginning of adolescence). A number of other
studies also report no dip in development (eg Itier and ?? 2004). Ref 4 (Ross, 2012)
concerns emotion recognition from body not facial movements, and does not really
report a dip either.
Authors response: We have corrected the interpretation of the study by Lawrence et al
(2008) suggesting that the face recognition might reach a plateau rather than dip and cited
Itier 2004 in the revised manuscript. The findings for Ross, Polson, and Grosbras (2012)
only refer to the emotion recognition from body movement and we now make this clear in
the introduction. Please see lines 59-64.
4. L 61: cognitive and information processing development is not really described.
Would be interesting to explore how it is related to social abilities development.
Authors response: We briefly touched on the literature that suggests a non-monotonic
development in cognitive abilities in the lines 59-64. However, these are not the focus of
the manuscript so we have kept the discussion very brief.
5. L 70-81: the specificity of social context/ stimuli in relation to reward is not clear at
all. This paragraph should be rephrased.
Authors response: On suggestion from the other reviewer we have now removed the
paragraphs describing results of neurobiological studies.
6. L 88-90: Likewise, how the SID task is indeed social should be described more
clearly.
Authors response: The reward used in this task are happy faces and it is reported that
participants’ reaction time is shorter for the happy faces than neutral faces. We have
added this detail in the manuscript. Please see lines 79-84.
7. The presentation of data by cohort is a bit confusing as text description and table do
not perfectly match. This might be a detail but the methods would read better if age
groups refered to cohorts expliciely. I.e l 165: Participants age (4-11 (cohorts 2 and
5), etc...
Authors response: Changes made as suggested. Please see lines 175-183.
8. l 174: how was sample size determined by cohort?
Authors response: For each study the sample size was planned before the data collection
began, however we did not use standard sample size calculator.
9. L. 176: what exclusion criteria were set?
Authors response: Information about the general health of the children was taken from the
primary caretakers. Only children reported to be “healthy” were included in the sample
reported here. No children whose parents signed the consent forms were excluded at any later
stage. Data from the adult participants was taken from the university students who declared
themselves to be “healthy”. We did not collect information about their past mental or
physical health related issues. We have now made it further clear in lines 188-192.
10. Analysis: which statistical package or softawre was used to perform the statistical
analyses
Authors response: We used Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS).
11. It would be informative to explicitly write the model tested. It is not clear how it is a
mixed-level model nor why participants ID is considered a between subject variable
(should this be cohort?) and not a random factor. In addition to the Wald statistics it
could be interesting to compare different models, for instance to test directly whether
the quadratic model fits the data better than the linear one.
Authors response: We have attempted to clarify the description of the logistic model in
lines 221-229. In particular, we enter data for every trial category of every participant in a
single data matrix. We add dummy variables coding for participant ID. Cohort was not
entered as an additional dummy variable because we had no predictions about cohort and it is
confounded with age. The model then compares how the effort level or the nature of the
stimuli influenced choice behaviour of the participants. The model also takes in account the
variables that are stable within the participant such as age or gender. As this is a mixed-level
model with a logistic link function, it does not seem practical to write out a single equation
describing the model.
We have performed a direct model comparison for the basic-preference model. This
comparison shows that the quadratic model fits the data significantly better than the linear
model. We now report this comparison in lines 339-340.
Results from both wald statistics as well as quadratic model confirm a non-monotonic
development in social seeking.
12. I don’t really understand why the two alternative analyses are conducted and what
additional information they bring. More explanation on this issue would be helpful.
Authors response: Logistic regression is the most general and powerful way to make sense
of this data, as it is well suited to binary responses across multiple participants. This analysis
suggests that the age has a significant role in modulating the effect of stimuli and effort on
the choice behaviour of the participant. Because the logistic regression results are complex to
plot and complex to understand, we also collapsed across the trial-level variables and
conducted a traditional linear regression. This gives results which are consistent with the
logistic regression. We include both analyses to show readers that the data can be understood
in the same way using both a sophisticated and simple approach.
13. The “change point “ analysis is not really clear. Is this the same as piecewise
regression? What is MSE (how is it computed?). If the goal is to test point of maximal
dip, why not use directly the coefficients from the regression analysis to compute it?
Authors response: We agree that the change point analysis might not be adding any to the
interpretation of the results. It was included because it was requested by a reviewer of a
previous iteration of this paper for a different journal. We have now dropped this analysis
from the paper.
14. Overall it is not really clear to me which of the models tested is the best fit to the data.
Authors response: Both wald statistics and quadratic regression support only one conclusion
that there is a non-linear trend in the social seeking over the age. Because of the binary nature
of the data Wald’s is the most appropriate statistics to be used here.
15. Discussion: how is pre-adolescence defined? Could puberty also have an effect on
social seeking?
Authors response: We have now replaced the term preadolescence to the young adolescents
in the manuscript. We make it clear in the lines 193-196 that we refer to participants aged 4-8
years as ‘children’, those aged 9-12 years as ‘young adolescents’, those aged 12-16 years as
‘older adolescents’ and those aged 17-20 as ‘young adults.
We agree that puberty is likely to be an important factor in the developmental changes we
see. We know from many other studies that puberty is associated with significant changes in
body, brain, hormones, social circumstances etc. However, it is complex to assess pubertal
status in children and we were not able to do this so we cannot comment specifically on how
puberty (as opposed to age) influences social seeking. We add a paragraph on this in the
discussion. Please see lines 412-420
16. I am not sure whether this is requirement of the journal or the author own initiative,
but I would rather see complete references rather than just weblinks.... A few typos in
the reference list. Ref 25 and 26 are identical
Authors response: We have now carefully checked all the references and given full
references than weblinks.
Reviewer: 2
1. One thing, however, is a bit confusing: the age-course of social seeking by itself
versus the age-course of the preference of social over non-social stimuli. For
example, would it be possible that social seeking by itself increases with increasing
age, while at all ages non-social stimuli are still the preferred option?
Authors response: We are not quite sure on the meaning of this comment. We think you are
referring to the distinction between a preference (for A versus B) and an absolute measure of
how much someone likes a single item A. The task we use can only measure a preference
between items. Other studies have attempted to measure an absolute value for different items
(e.g. approach task from Ewing et al 2013). However, in most real life situations, the choice
of how to spend your time, and whether to socially engage with someone is not made in the
abstract, but is a choice between two or more different activities (e.g. should I meet a friend
or work on a paper?). Therefore, we believe it is hard to put an absolute preference value on
social interactions and it is best evaluated as a preference of social over non-social
engagements.
If we did imagine an ‘absolute value’ of social stimuli, then it is possible that this could
change with age while remaining of lower value than the non-social stimuli (row A below).
Similarly, the value of non-social stimuli might decrease with age, resulting in an apparent
increase in social preference (row B below). CAM does not distinguish between these, but
rather measures the strength of the preference for one stimuli over another, because we
believe this better reflects the choices people make in the real world.
2. It would help the reader if the authors could make a clear distinction between both
types of analyses, or explain why they are two ways of looking at the same
phenomenon.
Authors response: We have amended the manuscript to clearly explain the purpose of each
of the analyses used in the study in the data analysis section (lines 290-317). We have now
dropped the change point analysis.
3. The same applies to the first part of the Discussion (lines 337-34): instead of focusing
on the age-course of social seeking by itself (as is the main focus of the Data-
analysis), the focus changes to the relative preference for social vs non-social stimuli.
Authors response: Please see response to the 1st comment in section 1 of the response to
reviewer 2.
4. The review of the empirical literature did not yield a consistent age pattern, hence the
present study aims were described as 'exploratory' (lines 154 & 156). Yet, in the
Methods a specific data analytic technique was used to detect "the age of maximum
dip in social preference". The authors might want to forecast this more specific
expectation at the end of the introduction.
Authors response: We had added the change point analysis as a posthoc step on the request
from a reviewer from a different journal. We have now dropped this analysis and focus only
on emphasising the exploratory hypotheses of this study.
5. In the findings it is reported that the maximum depth of social seeking was reached at
15 years of age. The authors provide some explanation for the reduction in social
seeking until 15 years of age, but they fail to explain the increase after 15 years of
age. What makes mid to late adolescents more social seeking than early adolescents?
Or is it mainly a matter of a temporary suppression of social seeking in ealy
adolescence?
Authors response: As the present data suggests that social seeking might be high in the
childhood and later adolescence we see the change in social seeking during early adolescent
years as a temporary dip perhaps due to changes in brain and social demands. Once this phase
of brain restructuring and social readjustments is over perhaps by age 15, the adolescents start
to show their typical social seeking behaviour of adults. We have discussed the same point
with some alternative explanations in the discussion section.
6. The brain research is definitely worth mentioning (lines 70 - 83), but it seems out of
place in the introduction. It would, however, add to the scope of the discussion, as it
could provide a partial explanation for the dip in social seeking.
Authors response: We have now removed the section discussing brain research.
7. A few typo's should be corrected -- mostly of the singular vs. plural kind.
Authors response: We have now carefully read and proof-checked the manuscript.
Reviewer 3
1. One major issue is the use of different cohorts which were tested under varying
circumstances. This introduces some potential confounds (biased samples,
motivational issues (e.g. different rewards for participation), attentional issues (e.g.
“walking by” testing during a public event), etc.). It is well taken that the authors
make an effort to describe these aspects in detail, however I think it is mandatory to
give potential confounds more room in the discussion (section about limitations), and
(wherever possible) include additional analyses to estimate the influence of these
issues on the analyses, especially if there could be interactions with age.
Authors response: We understand that changes in circumstances while testing might
introduce some potential confounds however it is very hard for us to quantify them. We
would like to emphasise that all testing (even the public-event testing) was conducted in a
quiet room with just the participant and experimenter present. This was not a noisy museum
with lots of people walking by. We now make this clear in lines 463-464 of the manuscript.
We agree that it is hard to eliminate possible difference in the testing situation of the cohorts
in our analysis, but we have clearly highlighted this limitation in the appropriate section.
Please see line 461-467.
2. One approach would be to include cohort (and probably age x cohort) effects as
explanatory variables to the statistical models if this is possible.
Authors response: Cohort is strongly confounded with age so including it as a separate
variable might not be right.
3. Alternatively, cohort effects (e.g. related to overall motivation or attention) could be
approached by comparing overall reaction times and variability measures between
cohorts, or showing that analyses within cohorts show similar trends as the whole
dataset.
Authors response: We directly compare the two adult cohorts (who did different versions of
the task) below and show that results are comparable for both. In our task, participant are not
under time pressure and can make between 1 and 3 keyhits on each trial, so RT is not a
suitable measure of performance. However, we know that completion time for the whole task
was between 18 and 20 minutes for both children and adults across all cohorts, and no
participants took substantially longer than this. For the developmental cohorts, cohort, age
range and testing location are entirely confounded so it does not make sense to test for cohort
effects that would only reveal our main effects of age. However, the current task has been
used robustly in a large number of studies (these and others) in our group and we have no
reason to believe that factors like testing location should have any impact on the results. We
now discuss possible cohort effect in the manuscript in lines 461-467. We have also included
a section of further analysis to show these results in the manuscript. Please see lines 347-371.

4. Table 1 should also include some bullet points about recruitment strategy of the
various cohorts (as detailed in the methods section) so the reader is able to evaluate
these issues “at a glance”.
Authors response: We have now added a column indicating setting or data collection and
the version of CAM used.
5. Assessment of further potentially confounding variables. Is there any measure /
estimation of cognitive abilities / SES? E.g. it appears obvious that 18-20 year olds
recruited at the university may be a biased sample in terms of cognitive abilities or
SES. Can you provide more details about what kind of clinical condition or
behavioral problem were exclusion criteria and how these were assessed exactly?
Were participants aged 18 years or older also checked for any *history* of
psychiatric conditions? For Instance, a history of anxiety disorders might influence
results. Please add potential issues to the limitations section.
Authors response: We have some data about the SES and intelligence test score from
children (cohorts 2,3 and 5) however we do not have the matching information from the
adults (cohorts 1 and 4). Therefore, it will be hard for us to see the influence of these variable
on social seeking. For the cohorts 2, 3 and 5 we have information about any associated
mental health conditions and we present data from only the typically developing participants.
However, for the cohorts 1 and 4 we did not collect information about any current or past
mental health issues. These participants self-declared themselves to be “healthy”. We
understand that anxiety and affective conditions can influence the social seeking behaviour of
the participants, therefore we have now highlighted this point in the limitations (lines 468-
472) and we are exploring these in our latest projects.
In two studies using the CAM task with participants with/without autism, we do not find any
effects of IQ on performance in either typical or autistic participants (Dubey, Ropar, &
Hamilton, 2015, 2017).
6. Different versions of the paradigms. On page 11, line 231ff it is mentioned that only
cohort 1 completed version 1, while all other cohorts completed version 2, which
apparently was slightly easier. Could you clarify why which version was used in
which cohort?
Authors response: The tool used in the study was first developed with the adult participants
in mind. However, we later adapted it for the children and the new adapted version could be
used with children as well as adults. Therefore, it was used with all the other cohorts except
cohort 1. We clarify it in the table 1 as well as lines 231-232.
7. Furthermore, it would be interesting to see whether results would change if cohort 1
was excluded.
Authors response: We re-ran the model excluding cohort 1 and the results are comparable
to before. In particular, the critical Stimuli by zAge2 effect is found in both analyses (with
cohort 1: Wald <U+F063>2 = 11.34, p =.001 and without cohort 1 Wald <U+F063>2 = 4.79, p =.029). We now
include this in the manuscript in lines 341-371.
8. Cohort 1 and 4 could also be compared directly to each other to see whether there is
an influence of version of the paradigm.
Authors response: We compared the social preference (collapsed over the effort levels) for
the two adult groups cohort 1 and cohort 4, results suggest no significant difference between
the groups in their social preference (t(60) = -1.619, p= 0.111). We now include this in the
manuscript in lines 341-371.
9. On line 234 it is stated that the versions differed “primarily” by … Please specify all
differences between paradigms, also mention briefly the additional conditions of
version 1 which were not analyzed here.
Authors response: We have rewritten the methods section to clarify the similarities and
differences between the two versions of the study. We have also added a table to compare
the two versions in detail in the section describing version 1and 2. We have now clearly
mentioned the conditions measured by the remaining 120 trials of the CAM task version 1.
Please see line 270.
10. Touch screen vs. clicks. It is not entirely clear which participants used which version.
Please clarify. On page 10, line 218/219 the authors explain that participants could
either respond by pressing a key press or by touching the screen and that this
depended on the age of the participant. Could you please clarify how many
participants responded by which option? Might this influence the results or the
interpretation of the results? Later on (page 11, line 234/235) the authors mentioned
that the response option depended on the version of the paradigm. This is in conflict
with what was stated earlier because also cohort 4 did version 2. Was the touch
screen option related to the paradigm version, the cohort, or the exact age of the
participant?
Authors response: As above, we have rewritten the methods to clarify this and included it in
the new table. We mention in line 231-232 that version 1 was used only with cohort 1. To
clarify it further we have now added a column to the table 1 to show which version of the
CAM was used for each cohort. We apologise for the confusion the response option
depended on the version of the CAM used. We have now corrected this in lines 229-274.
11. In the introduction (page 5, line 91ff) three studies are mentioned which examined
social seeking. However, an important aspect of two studies is missing that makes the
results of both studies less comparable than stated here. Kohls et al. compared two
social stimuli with varying valence with each other, social reward and social
disapproval, but were less interested in different types of stimuli (social, monetary
etc.). Cox et al. on the other hand compared multiple stimuli with each other,
including control, non-social and social. Thus, results are not conflicting (as implied)
but shed light on different aspects of social seeking.
Authors response: You are right in pointing the difference between the Kohl et al and Cox et
al’ studies. The contrasting findings are primarily presented by Flores et al. (2015) and Cox
et al (2015). While Kohl et al and Flores et al have some comparable findings. We have now
separated these studies to report their findings clearly. Please see lines 85-90.
12. Version 1 and 2 had the same number of total analyzed trials. Why did you chose to
use less familiarization trials for version 2 compared to version 1? Why was the
distribution of trials different between versions? Could this influence the results?
Furthermore it is not mentioned whether the described possibilities of lock
distributions were counterbalanced for the type of stimulus. In line 289 (results) it is
stated that “levels of effort” were “balanced over trials”. What does that mean? The
issue of different lock distributions might be especially relevant for the basic
preference analysis.
Authors response: The familiarisation trials were reduced in the later version to save time.
This was replaced by an additional instruction step that was added in the beginning to ensure
participant learns the association.
In the first version of the task, we expected that the trials with a high lock difference (e.g. 1
versus 3 locks) might elicit a clearer behavioural effect than the trials with a low lock
differences (e.g. 1 versus 2 locks) so we included slightly more of the former in the design.
The results of version 1 suggested this was not the case, so we readjusted the trial number to
have equal distribution for each lock difference.
We counterbalanced 1) the position of the boxes on right and left side, 2) the number of locks
(1, 2 and 3) on each side and each box. Therefore, we had same number of trials in which
social and non-social boxes appeared on the left side of the screen with 1, 2, and 3 locks and -
2, -1, 0, 1, and 2 lock differences (from the left side). This means that an imaginary
participant who chooses the smallest number of locks every time should select the left and
right box equally often, and similarly an imaginary participant who chooses the social
stimulus every time should select the left and right box equally often.
13. For the smaller children the experimenter remained at the desk to encourage the child
to complete the experiment (page 12, line 265/266). Isn’t this influencing the overall
behavior of the children? See also major comment related to cohort effects.
Authors response: We understand that presence of experimenter might influence behaviour
of the children. We tried our best not to interact with the child unless essential, and we made
sure that the child was not encouraged to choose any specific box. We have now added this to
the limitation section.
14. Figure 2: A few participants seemed to have chosen the stimuli in 100% or 0% of the
trials. Can these participants be included in the study? It is difficult to argue with
preference/social seeking if the participants did not explore the different options but
rather were stuck with the same stimuli. Related: Were any other measures taken to
exclude participants with odd behavioral responses (especially those that completed
the self-paced version of the paradigm which was not “supervised” by the
experimenter?)
Authors response: During the familiarisation trials participants had a chance to look at both
social and non-social stimuli, after that in the choice trial they were free to choose any box
they liked. So all participants were aware of both categories of stimuli and had seen examples
of each. We believe that people with 100% or 0% trials of choosing social stimuli might
indicate a strong motivation to see or avoid social stimuli. This must be a normal variation
within the typical population, and we did not want to bias our results by eliminating some
points.
15. Results Basic Preference Analyses and Change point analyses: Could you clarify how
the results of both analyses can be combined, i.e. how differences between both
analyses should be interpreted? Specifically, the two different ages (11 and 15 years
of age, respectively) which are revealed by the two analyses?
Authors response: The data shows that the social preference is high in children and then it
gradually dips in young adolescents before rising to adult levels. The two different analyses
give different indications of the precise timing of the change. The change point analysis was
added post-hoc at the request of a reviewer when we submitted a previous iteration of this
paper to another journal. As it conflicts with our pre-planned analysis and adds little to the
paper, we have now removed the change point analysis from the paper.
16. Discussion (page 16, 352/353): The authors give as one possible explanation of
increased social anxiety prevalence during adolescence. Do you have any measure on
this for the current sample to verify this hypothesis? Isn’t that a bit contradictory
because children with behavioral problems were excluded from participation?
Authors response: Here we mean the anxiety which is not clinical in nature but is typical to
adolescences as suggested by Somerville (2013) and Elkind & Bowen (1979). We have now
removed the studies that might have evaluated clinical anxiety in typical population and
added the studies that specifically measure social sensitivity. Please see lines 392-411. We
did not take any measure of clinical anxiety in the present study, but plan to examine this in
future.
