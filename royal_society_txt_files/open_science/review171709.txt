Noncooperative Bargaining Games such as the Ultimatum Game are a very interesting type of
games with manifold applications in economy, sociology and even biology. Classical game theory
based on the concept of Nash equilibrium is often unable to explain observations. The refinement
by the concept of subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium often considerably deviates from
observations. Therefore, many alternative refined solution concepts have been suggested. The
author has recently come up with a solution concept, which he named "economic harmony
model". I consider that concept very promising because it can be explained on theoretical
grounds and is well in agreement with observations.
In the present paper, the "economic harmony model" is applied to a number of game situations
such as bargaining games with alternating offers. The paper is very interesting and represents, in
my opinion, a significant advancement in the field. It is nice that the author discusses several
studies such as the Binmore et al. (1985) study and Neelin et al. (1988) study.
I do have some comments, see below.
Major comments
(1) In the "economic harmony model" established by the author, the utilities are defined as a
function of the ratio between the actual and aspired payoffs. More specifically, for the Ultimatum
Game, the aspired payoff of the responder is equated with the actual payoff of the proposer. My
question is whether this is somehow recursive because the responder does not know beforehand
what the proposer will get. A more straightforward idea may be to take ½ as the aspired payoff
of the responder. This would lead to the relation:
Proposer’s payoff divided by 1 (her aspired payoff) = responder’ payoff divided by ½
That is: Proposer’s payoff = (1 - proposer’s payoff) divided by ½
which leads to
Proposer’s payoff = 2/3.
I do not doubt that the Golden ratio is a better solution, but I think the explanation in terms of
aspired payoffs could be made stronger.
(2) In his paper Suleiman, R., Games, 8 (2017) 2, the author gives a nice psychological explanation
for the Golden Ratio solution in the Ultimatum Game. The ratio of the payoff of the responder to
that of the proposer is equal to the ratio of the latter to what the proposer could get in principle
(notably the entire pie). It would help the reader to give that explanation here again (perhaps I
overlooked it).
(3) p.2, last para: “we present a recently proposed approach to understanding economic
interactions (Suleiman, 2017)…”. This sounds as if the same result would be sold twice.
Fortunately, the sentence continues: “and utilize it for predicting behavior in bargaining games
with alternating offers”. I suggest shortening it to “we utilize a recently proposed approach to
understanding economic interactions (Suleiman, 2017) for predicting behavior in bargaining
games with alternating offers.”
(4) p.3, 1st para: “the proposed approach sways the attention away from the concept of Nash
equilibrium”. This sounds as if the proposed solutions are no Nash equilibria. To my eyes, the
drawback of the traditional approach is that some games show so many Nash equilibria that this
3
concept is too “weak” in the context of bargaining games. New solution concepts should be
devised in a way to narrow down the number of solutions. Very probably, the author meant the
right thing. Perhaps, it can be said more clearly that the point is to eliminate irrelevant Nash
equilibria.
(5) p.3, 2nd para: “The proposed modification of the utility function is very simple. … we assign
as an argument the variable /”. I wonder what happens when the offer in the Ultimatum Game is
so low that the responder rejects. The argument is zero then, and so would be the utility function
of the responder, according to that approach. However, my feeling is that the utility of the
responder should be positive then, because she has the satisfaction to have punished a selfish
proposer.
(6) p.5, Section III, 1st para: I suggest citing Rubinstein (1982) already here because he was the
first to propose such a game, rather than citing him only in the 2nd para.
(7) On p. 12, a “Stahl/Rubinstein division” and the “Stahl/Rubinstein model” are mentioned.
Please give a Ref.
(8) I strongly feel that the work by Guillermina Jasso on the Golden Ratio in Justice Research is
worth being cited, e.g. Jasso, G. Theoretical unification in justice and beyond. Social Just. Res.20,
336–371 (2007).
(9) Some sentences on real-world applications of the theory would make the paper more
attractive. Negotiations between companies? Between insurance companies and their clients?
Between parents about housework and childcare?
(10) In the context of bargaining, the famous bargaining solution proposed by John Nash (The
bargaining problem, Econometrica. 18, 1950, 155–162) and alternative proposals such as the Kalai-
Smorodinsky solution (Other solutions to Nash's bargaining problem, Econometrica. 43, 1975, pp.
513–518) come to mind. The relation between these and the present approach are worth being
discussed.
Minor comments
(a) p.4, Section II, 2nd line: What does the superscript J_i mean? And can it somehow be avoided
to have four or five subscript and superscript levels in the symbol {s_i_j}_J_i_j=1?
(b) 2nd para below Eq. (1): “idiosyncratic personalities”. This term sounds as if all players are
somewhat eccentric. I suggest changing to “specific personalities”.
(c) Line below Eq. (1): “Where _ is player i’s actual payoff”. “where” should be lower case.
(d) On p.12, the “Rubinstein solution” is mentioned. Indeed, the paper Rubinstein (1982) is cited
on p. 5. However, the reader might not remember this. Therefore, it would be helpful to cite it
again when mentioning the Rubinstein solution.
(e) p.2, 2nd para: „ratio of one’s opponent’s to one’s own payoff” is cumbersome wording.
Perhaps rephrase as “ratio between the payoffs of the opponent and oneself” or so.
(f) p.19, 1st sentence: “While there is agreement that players do not attempt to maximize their
monetary payoffs…”. This is perhaps phrased in a too strict and generalized way. For example,
the proposer in the Ultimatum Game does attempt to maximize her monetary payoff, in my
opinion, while the responder is willing to sacrifice a payoff if it is too low. I suggest toning down
4
by saying “… agreement that players do not always attempt to maximize their monetary
payoffs…”.
(g) p.19, 3rd para: “Schuster (2016)” should read “Schuster (2017)”, see Ref. 43.
(h) Given that the References are ordered alphabetically, Refs. 42 and 43 should be swapped.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In the manuscript under consideration, the author applies his novel notion of Economic Harmony
(EH) to explain deviations from Nash equilibrium in bargaining games with alternating offers.
The idea behind the EH is very simple: "While (Nash) equilibrium is defined as an intersection of
players' strategies from which no player is behooved to deviate unilaterally (even when the status
quo is disadvantageous and completely unfair to him or her), the harmony solution of a game is
defined as the intersection of strategies at which all players are equally satisfied (with respect to
individual aspiration levels)."
The derivation of the predictions of the EH for these games is sound. And these predictions
match average behaviour in these games impressively well. Thus, I think that the this paper
could be a nice contribution to the literature.
MAJOR COMMENT
Individual behaviour in the games under consideration is typically heterogenous (different
players make different offers). However, EH makes one single prediction (which matches average
behaviour very well, but it does not match individual behaviour). I think that the paper would
5
improve if the author adds a discussion on how (if possible) one can recover heterogeneity using
his EH.
MINOR COMMENTS:
- Page 2, lines 11-39. In the revision of the literature regarding solution concepts, I think that the
author should mention also the "cooperative equilibrium" introduced originally for social
dilemmas (Capraro, 2013; Barcelo & Capraro, 2015) and then extended to the UG and, more
generally, to Pareto solvable games (Capraro et al, 2015). Also this notion makes reasonably good
predictions of average play in Dictator Game, Ultimatum Game, Public Goods game and many
other games.
- Page 3, lines 41-45. The author says that economic harmony maintains the narrow rationality
assumption. However, as pointed out later (Page 4, lines 51,52), the author assumes that people
has a theory of mind in order to predict the aspiration level of the other participant. So,
somewhere, the assumption that there is some interconnection among the players is present. I
think that the author should highlight this point better.
- Section III: I think it would be way clearer in the form: theorem1-proof1, theorem2-proof2.
Perhaps divide in multiple theorems and proofs according to the various hypotheses/cases or
maybe put some lemmas and then only one summarising theorem? In any case, I think the
current version of Section III is not optimal.
- Page 8. Line 42-44. Not clear why the game should continue up to the second period if, in lines
31-34, it is said that under the same conditions the game should stop at period 1. Does this
happen because the first player fail to play according to EH? I think that a little discussion about
why the game continues although it is predicted not to do so should be added.
- Page 9, line 12. Replace "decrease" with "increase".
- Page 10, line 47. Technically speaking, that is not a discontinuity of the function. If anything, it’s
a di continuity of its derivative.
- Page 11. The author says "The Binmore et al. (2002) study included eight discount factors, six of
which are lower than the predicted Golden Ratio threshold, and three are higher than the
threshold.” There might be a mistake somewhere, since 3+6=9 and not 8. (six should probably be
replaced by five).
- Page 14, line 26-27. “lower six \delta” should be replaced into “lower five \delta”
- Page 14, line 29. It should be 1-\phi\delta
- Page 14. Very interesting, but it is not clear in the data by Binmore et al, if P1’s demand is
decreasing with \delta for \delta < \phi. I think that an interesting test for the EH would be to
conduct a larger experiment with more \delta’s and a larger sample size and show that P1’s
demand is constant in \delta for \delta \leq \phi and then decreases when \delta > \phi. That
would be amazing and, I think, surprising.
- Table 5. Please include the weighted average.
SIDE COMMENT:
I would be very interested in seeing the predictions for the Dictator Game. Moreover, is there a
way to derive theoretical support for the fact that DG giving is usually correlated to UG offers?

Associate Editor's comments:
Both recommendations are essentially positive, although both referees also provide several
comments on how your work could be improved further. Personally, I agree with such an
assessment, but I would also like to point out that research done in the realm of statistical physics
and applied mathematics has recently provided an explanation for fairness in bargaining games.
In particular, in Defense mechanisms of empathetic players in the spatial ultimatum game, Phys.
Rev. Lett. 109, 078701 (2012) and Accuracy in strategy imitations promotes the evolution of
fairness in the spatial ultimatum game, EPL 100, 28005 (2012), novel concepts for explaining the
emergence of fairness have been presented, related to the introduction of discrete strategies and
spatial structure. A useful review of these research efforts is Statistical physics of human
cooperation, Physics Reports 687, 1-51 (2017). Since Royal Society Open Science is strongly
interdisciplinary, a comprehensive introduction also beyond the very classical boundaries of the
field is recommended.

In the manuscript under consideration, the author applies his novel notion of Economic Harmony
(EH) to explain deviations from Nash equilibrium in bargaining games with alternating offers.
The idea behind the EH is very simple: "While (Nash) equilibrium is defined as an intersection of

The derivation of the predictions of the EH for these games is sound. And these predictions
match average behaviour in these games impressively well. Thus, I think that the this paper
could be a nice contribution to the literature.
MAJOR COMMENT
Individual behaviour in the games under consideration is typically heterogenous (different
players make different offers). However, EH makes one single prediction (which matches average
behaviour very well, but it does not match individual behaviour). I think that the paper would
improve if the author adds a discussion on how (if possible) one can recover heterogeneity using

I'm very much satisfied with the revision. There is just one typo in the Response to reviewers: For
Comment #10 by Reviewer #1 (me), the author wrote: "This remark is well taken. I added a
complete paragraph to this effect (see last para. in page 20)." It should read "first para. in page

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Matjaz Perc):
The reviewer has a few outstanding remarks that require attention. As far as "Response to the
Associate Editor's remark" go, I find myself unsatisfied because although the author states that
"in the revised version I added a brief mentioning of the relevant literature", I do not find this
addition in the revised manuscript, neither the two seminal papers Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 078701
(2012) and EPL 100, 28005 (2012). The author should please revise the manuscript in agreement
with these remaining comments.

Appendix A
12-Dec-17
Dear Editors,
Enclosed please find my revised manuscript titled "On Gamesmen and
Fairmen: Explaining Fairness in Noncooperative Bargaining Games".
In the revised version I did my best to incorporate all the changes suggested
by the Associate Editor and the two reviewers.
In the following I detailed the changes made in response to the Associate
Editor and the two reviewers.
1. Response to the Associate Editor's remark
The Associate Editor has kindly drew my attention to a novel research effort,
in which the mathematics developed in the realm of statistical physics is
applied to the investigation of human cooperation and fairness. In the revised
version I added a brief mentioning of the relevant literature suggested by the
Associate Editor (please see 3nd. para. in page 3). I also related to this line of
research in the discussion, and compared its predictions with our Golden
Ratio prediction (see complete par. at the bottom of p.23).
2. Response to the first reviewer's remarks:
(I) Major comments
Comment #1: The reviewer raised the possibility that responders might aspire
to receive 50% of the entire amount, which in the case of the ultimatum game
2 1
results in the prediction (3 , 3), for the proposer and responder, respectively.
This remark is well taken. In fact, this possibility was entertained in our
previous publication (Suleiman, Games, 2017) for the case of the ultimatum
game, and in this paper for the case of the discussed sequential bargaining
game (see para. after eq. 4 in page 6, until subsection (b) in page 7).
In addition, a complete paragraph was added in which the rationales behind
the equal-split aspiration and the Golden Ratio split are explained, and
compared (see subsection (a) at the top of p. 7).
(2) Comment #2: The review suggested that I give a psychological explanation
of the Golden Ratio solution.
This point is also well taken. I added a sentence alluding to the suggested
psychological explanation.
Comment #3. Corrected.
Comment #4. Corrected
Comment #5: This remark is well taken. I added a long paragraph explaining
the importance of nonmonetary utilities, such as pride, self-worth, revenge,
etc. (see para. at the bottom of p. 22 - top of p. 24). I also added three related
references (ref. 21, 66, 76).
Comment #6.
Corrected.
Comment #7: "On p. 12, a “Stahl/Rubinstein division” and the
“Stahl/Rubinstein model” are mentioned. Please give a Ref.".
Corrected.
Comment #8: "I strongly feel that the work by Guillermina Jasso on the Golden
Ratio in Justice Research is worth being cited, e.g. Jasso, G. Theoretical
unification in justice and beyond. Social Just. Res.20, 336–371 (2007)".
This remark was well taken. I alluded to this body of research (see lines 3-11
from bottom of page 20). I also added the suggested references.
Comment #9: "Some sentences on real-world applications of the theory would
make the paper more attractive".
I added a paragraph to this effect (see p. 23, 2nd para., from "this message, to
the end of the para.).
Comment #10: This remark is well taken. I added a complete paragraph to this
effect (see last para. in page 20).
(II) Minor comments
Comment (a): Regarding the notation in p.4, Section II, 2nd line.
The notation is admittedly complex, but it is necessary. The superscript <U+0001D43D><U+0001D456> is the
number of admissible strategies of player i. In the general case, the number J is
not equal for all players, thus the superscript i for J. Since this notation appears
only once, I prefer to keep it as is.
Comment (b): Regarding 2nd para below Eq. (1).
The word idiosyncratic is common in the psychological literature. It means
individual or specific. To avoid confusion, I changed it to "distinctive".
Comment (c).
Corrected.
Comment (d).
Corrected.
Comment (e).
Corrected.
Comment (f).
Corrected.
Comment (g).
Corrected.
Comment (h).
Corrected.
3. Response to the second reviewer's remarks:
(I). Major Comments
Comment #1: "I think that the paper would improve if the author adds a
discussion on how (if possible) one can recover heterogeneity using his EH".
This remark is well taken. Please see from second para. in p. 22 to the end of
first para. in p. 23.
(II) Minor comments
Comment #1: Page 2, lines 11-39. I think that the author should mention also
the "cooperative equilibrium"" first introduced by Capraro et al., 2013".
This comment is well taken. Please see para. at the bottom of p. 2, and top of
p.3).
Comment #2: Page 3, lines 41-45 (regarding the rationality assumption)
This remark was well taken. I added a complete paragraph on to this effect in
the discussion section. Please see p.22, 2nd para., from "in deriving", until
"dynamics".
Comment #3. I apologize that I am not a good mathematician. I prefer to keep
the style as is.
Comment #4: Page 8. Line 42-44. (why the game might continue to the second
period). I added a sentence to this effect.
Comment #5: Page 9, line 12.
Corrected
Comment #6: Page 10, line 47.
I replaced the word "discontinuity" by "non-monotonicity".
Comment #7: Page 11.
Corrected
Comment #8: Page 14, line 26-27.
Corrected
Comment #9: Page 14, line 29.
Corrected
Comment #10: Page 14. (conducting a larger experiment, with more d values)
Corrected. See addition in the p. 20, second para. from "in addition" to "kink
point".
Comment #11: "Table 5. Please include the weighted average".
Since the different experiments, and conditions in each experiment, used
different <U+0001D6FF>1 , and <U+0001D6FF>2 values, the weighted average is not informative.
(III) Side comment
I prefer not to include a discussion about the theory prediction for the dictator
game, because it might weaken the focus of the present paper. However, I
alluded to this issue in another, yet unpublished, manuscript titled "An
Aspirations-Homeostasis Theory of Interactive Decisions model". The
ultimatum game differs from the dictator game in that the second player in
the first game has a strong (costly) punishment power, while in the second
game he has no power. Thus, in the dictator game I expect that proposers will
raise their demands above the Golden ratio prediction. However, in dictator
games with third part punishment, the theory predicts that dictators will
demand close to the Golden Ratio. These predictions are confirmed by
experiments (see e.g., Henrich, et al., 2005).

Behavioral experiments in 15 small-scale societies. Behavioral and Brain
Sciences, 28, 795–855.
I hope that you find the revised paper suitable for publication in the Royal
Society Open Science.
Sincerely yours,
Ramzi Suleiman.
Appendix B
Dear Editors,
Enclosed please find my second revision of my manuscript titled "On
Gamesmen and Fairmen: Explaining Fairness in Noncooperative Bargaining
Games".
Your remark is well taken. The submitted revision did in fact relate to the
statistical physics approach to human cooperation in two places: 1. In the
introduction in p.3, and in the discussion in p. 23. The only reference which I
missed mentioning is Szolnoki, Perc, & Szabó, EPL 100, 28005 (2012). In the
enclosed revision this was corrected. Please see blow the quotes of two
paragraphs, with the EPL reference included.
In p. 3: "An interesting approach to the study of human cooperation and
fairness comes from Non-equilibrium statistical physics, in particular the
Monte Carlo methods and the theory of collective behavior of interacting
particles near phase transition points (Szolnoki, Perc, & Szabó, 2012a, 2012b,
Perc et al., 2017). By treating models of human cooperation as classical spin
models, this approach has proven insightful regarding the evolution of
cooperation in human societies".
2. In p. 23: "Quite interestingly, the solutions derived from statistical physics,
prescribing collective behavior near the phase transition points of particles'
interaction (Szolnoki, Perc, & Szabó, 2012a, 2012b, Perc et al., 2017), fits well
with the Golden Ratio solution derived in the present paper, which was in
fact inspired by my recently proposed Information Relativity theory (e.g.,
Suleiman, 2013, 2016a, 2017b, in press)".
I also corrected minor typos, mainly in the reference list.
I hope that you find my correction satisfactory.
