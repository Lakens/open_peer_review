The manuscript by Brasseur et al is dedicated to the identification and quantification of some
spinochromes in body compartments of Echinometra mathaei. The paper is interesting and
provide significant contribution to the study of PHNQ. After close evaluation the manuscript I
have some comments and questions:
1. In introduction: according to recent review (doi: 10.1007/s11101-018-9547-3) more than 40
PHNQ has been reported in the literature.
2. In introduction: the phrase "Echinochrome A, has been introduced as the
active component in a drug called Histochrome and administered against ophthalmic diseases"
need more correct reference (see for instance Tedeeva et al. (2014) Pac Med J 4:17–20;
doi:10.1023/A:1023659331010; or recent review doi: 10.1007/s11101-018-9547-3).
3. In introduction: some spinochrome dimers has been identified in sea urchins (doi:
10.1016/j.chroma.2011.10.045; doi: 10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.09.018)
4. Attached figures are not numbered. It makes difficult the understanding of relation between
reference to figure in the text and figures.
5. In results I would suggest to use unified numbers for identified spinochromes (in the text,
Tables and Figures). There are no numbers of spinochromes in the Figures 3 and 6. The figure 6 is
not necessary, could be merged with Fig 6.
7. In discussion: antiallergic, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, hypocholesterolemic aand other
pharmacological effects are described in the literature for spinochromes (see recent review doi:
10.1007/s11101-018-9547-3).
8. The concentration of pigments in shell and spines of sea urchins has been discussed previously
(doi: 10.2331/fishsci.68.sup2_1641; PMC1275162; doi: 10.1002/cbdv.201700182) The discussion
should be updated with the mentioned references.
9. Actually PHNQ were observed in coelomic fluid previously. The echinochrome was initially
observed in perivisceral fluid of Echinus esculentus. Additionally see doi:10.1016/0305-
0491(84)90008-7; 10.1016/0305-0491(84)90008-7, etc.

label_comment_2
Very interesting results are presented in the article, regarding the presence of different
echinochromes in body compartments. However, the discussion and conclusion should be
detailed and author could discuss better the function of such molecules in each system (digestive,
immune, and so on). Although the literature of echinochromes is poor, there are article that can
be used and even hypothesis could be created.
In addition, the exact mass (at least 2 decimals) should be informed in the table 2. The authors
probably have this information, once the equipment in the analysis has this resolution. Moreover,
MS/MS mode could be performed to improve and confirm the identification of echinochromes.
Otherwise, authors should inform standards or other techniques used for this identification, other
than the molecular mass.
Regarding the chromatography, is not mentioned the type of column was used in the reversed-
phase (C18, C8,?) and the equilibration time is 0 in the table 1. Moreover, is not clear the method
for echinamine A and B purification, once for isomer separation a specific column should be
used.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Walter Salzburger):
This manuscript has now been seen by two expert referees, who both find the work of interest but
- at the same time - raise a number of concerns, which the authors should address in a revised
version. Both reviewers find that the available literature is not adequately represented in the
manuscript. Reviewer #2 further points out several several methodological aspects that should
find their way into a revised version, such as the determination of the mass, quality controls, and
details on the experiments. They also listed further suggestion to improve the manuscript.
Finally, the authors should incorporate an ethics statement in their manuscript following the
discussions about research permits prior to the review process.

The update of the bibliography makes the manuscript way better, considering a descriptive work.
The unsuccessful of MS/MS experiments should be mentioned on the discussion section, once
would be important for readers who would try to follow this method on future works.
Regarding the equilibration time, since the value is 0, there was not equilibration of the column,
just a start condition (with would take at least 5 min, according to the column size). I understand
the point, but I think the nomenclature of the table is wrong.

The authors warmly thank both reviewers for the time they took to correct this
manuscript and their interesting recommendations. Here under, we answer to all of their
remarks/corrections.
Also, the text was corrected for English mistakes, the references were checked and some
other precisions were added to make this manuscript more reader-friendly (all changes

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript by Brasseur et al is dedicated to the identification and quantification of some
spinochromes in body compartments of Echinometra mathaei. The paper is interesting and
provide significant contribution to the study of PHNQ. After close evaluation the manuscript I
have some comments and questions:
1) In introduction: according to recent review (doi: 10.1007/s11101-018-9547-3) more
than 40 PHNQ has been reported in the literature.
This review was not available when we submitted our manuscript, but it
definitively deserves to be cited. It has now been added as reference number 7 and
cited several times in the manuscript.
2) In introduction: the phrase "Echinochrome A, has been introduced as the
active component in a drug called Histochrome and administered against ophthalmic
diseases" need more correct reference (see for instance Tedeeva et al. (2014) Pac Med
J 4:17–20; doi:10.1023/A:1023659331010; or recent review doi: 10.1007/s11101-018-
9547-3).
Both references were added. Tedeeva is reference number 4 (+ reference number
7).
3) In introduction: some spinochrome dimers has been identified in sea urchins (doi:
10.1016/j.chroma.2011.10.045; doi: 10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.09.018).
We added this interesting information in our introduction and in the references
(10 and 12).
4) Attached figures are not numbered. It makes difficult the understanding of relation
between reference to figure in the text and figures.
Sorry for this, our figure files were labelled as Fig. 1-7. We guess that the
submission process did not keep this information.
5) In results I would suggest to use unified numbers for identified spinochromes (in the
text, Tables and Figures). There are no numbers of spinochromes in the Figures 3 and
6.
All spinochromes are now constantly numbered in the results and in the figure 3.
It is indeed important to compare the Table 2 with the Figure 3. Because the Figure
6 only represents the naphtoquinones distribution, we did not add the numbers to
avoid any misunderstanding.
6) The figure 6 is not necessary, could be merged with Fig 6.
We guess there is a mistake in this remark but figure 6 is necessary and cannot be
merged with another figure.
7) In discussion: antiallergic, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, hypocholesterolemic aand
other pharmacological effects are described in the literature for spinochromes (see
recent review doi: 10.1007/s11101-018-9547-3).
The reference 7 has been added to the bioactive effects statement in the discussion,
but also in the introduction where we also mention the pharmacological effects.
8) The concentration of pigments in shell and spines of sea urchins has been discussed
previously (doi: 10.2331/fishsci.68.sup2_1641; PMC1275162; doi:
10.1002/cbdv.201700182). The discussion should be updated with the mentioned
references.
Those two references are now mentioned in the discussion (25, 27).
9) Actually, PHNQ were observed in coelomic fluid previously. The echinochrome was
initially observed in perivisceral fluid of Echinus esculentus. Additionally see
doi:10.1016/0305-0491(84)90008-7; 10.1016/0305-0491(84)90008-7, etc.
The sentence was modified, and the reference is now mentioned in the discussion
(29).
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
Very interesting results are presented in the article, regarding the presence of different
echinochromes in body compartments.
1) However, the discussion and conclusion should be detailed, and author could discuss
better the function of such molecules in each system (digestive, immune, and so on).
Although the literature of echinochromes is poor, there are article that can be used and
even hypothesis could be created.
Because this article is a first step into the characterization of the naphthoquinones
of E. mathaei with different colors, it would be overstated to detail the
discussion/conclusion. Our discussion is hypothesis-driven and the precise role of
naphtoquinones in the different organs of the urchin should be detailed in future
studies in order to confirm or not our hypotheses and go further into details. We
updated the bibliography with recent studies, but these ones mostly describe the
PHNQ content of different species/tissues and also provide hypotheses about the
biological role of naphtoquinones for the urchin. We want to be sure not to confirm
hypotheses if they have not been checked yet. Nowadays, a lot of hypotheses
become facts when they are cited from a paper to another one.
2) In addition, the exact mass (at least 2 decimals) should be informed in the table 2. The
authors probably have this information, once the equipment in the analysis has this
resolution.
We totally agree, table 2 has been updated and 2 decimals are now mentioned in
the MW and [M-H] – columns.
3) Moreover, MS/MS mode could be performed to improve and confirm the identification
of echinochromes. Otherwise, authors should inform standards or other techniques used
for this identification, other than the molecular mass.
We indeed tried MS/MS but the spinochromes, because of the 3 aromatic cycles,
are too stable to be broken. However, MS/MS would not change the incertitude we
have about the position of some radicals that can only be solved by NMR. Then, it
would not provide more information that the precise mass measurement.
4) Regarding the chromatography, is not mentioned the type of column was used in the
reversed-phase (C18, C8,?) and the equilibration time is 0 in the table 1. Moreover, is
not clear the method for echinamine A and B purification, once for isomer separation a
specific column should be used.
It is a C8 column, we added this information in the Material and methods section.
Yes is is normal, it means that at the initial time (0), we have 80% of eluant A and
20% of eluant B.
We think there is a misunderstanding here, we did not extract echinamine A and
B! We highlighted a spinochrome that could be echinamine A or B. Because they
are isomers we could not be sure of the identification and this is why we named it
echinamine A/B. It is explained in the text “The distinction between the isomeric
Echinamine A/B is not achievable based only on the accurate mass measurements” and the
legend of the figure 3 mentions that “The Echinamine A and B are both represented as we
cannot make a clear-cut distinction.”.
