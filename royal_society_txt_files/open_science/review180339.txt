label_comment_1
The authors submit a concise, well written and informative manuscript. I found the materials
well presented and clear to follow. The subject area of prey switching and what the implications
are for biotic resistance in invasion ecology as a mechanism for invasion success is understudied
with regards to the FR application.
As noted from the submission, the paper has already been through a round of reviews and I am
satisfied that the authors have dealt adequately in their responses and edits. I would also
question the use of single replicates for controls however do not feel that it damages the integrity
of the work.
I would also be interested in the discussion of the drivers that are resulting in the native prey
being selected for over the invasive prey. Is this a result of prey behaviours or simply familiarity
with the native over the invasive. However I expect the word count of the journal does not allow
for expansion on this issue.
Two minor formatting comments I have are:

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This ms neatly highlights the inadequacy of simple theoretical models such as functional
response curves for predicting the outcome of biotic invasions. It is therefore valuable and timely.
Well done. However it does not demonstrate that models incorporating both functional response
and prey switching will be reliable predictors, despite the fact that the experimental results
appear to match field observations. The outcome of biotic invasions is likely to be influenced by a
wide array of interacting biotic and abiotic factors; the experimental results may have been
reversed if, for example, specific habitat features or higher order predators had been included.
A stronger caveat is still needed in the Discussion to make it clear that prey switching is one more
critical aspect to be used alongside FRs, but that more complex models incorporating response to
a wider range of biotic and abiotic factors are likely to be needed to produce reliable models of
likely invasion success and impact.
Minor comments
The authors response to previous reviews appear to have tidied up the ms well.
In the abstract, line 28, I suggest that predators consumed "..disproportionately more native prey
than expected from the relative abundance of native and invasive species." the last phrase in this
sentence is unnecessary given what comes before and follows it.
line 85 "n=3 replicates per density" just to be perfectly clear.

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
5
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science charge article processing charges for all new
submissions that are accepted for publication. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to
Royal Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers
submitted as part of our collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors submit a concise, well written and informative manuscript. I
found the materials well presented and clear to follow. The subject area of
prey switching and what the implications are for biotic resistance in invasion
ecology as a mechanism for invasion success is understudied with regards to
the FR application.
As noted from the submission, the paper has already been through a round of

However I expect the word count of the journal does not allow for expansion
on this issue.
Response: We thank the Reviewer for positive comments regarding the
succinctness and value of the manuscript in the context of invasion
ecology. Although the intrinsic drivers of our results are not examined
experimentally, the result could be a combination of behavioural and
coevolutionary elements. We feel, and agree, that further in-depth
discussion of this aspect would detract from the present conciseness of the
article.
Two minor formatting comments I have are:
Line 68-70 – In this study…
This sentence is cumbersome and hard to read
Response: We have amended L68-71 to improve the readability of this
sentence.
Line 84 Experiment 1 vs line 87 Experiment two

Response: We thank the Reviewer for this observation, and have made
the terminology consistent throughout the MS. See L94 and L102.

Response: We thank the Reviewer for their comments surrounding the
utility of classic theoretical frameworks in the context of invasion ecology.
We agree entirely that further research incorporating further effects
associated with varied environmental contexts is required to holistically
model invasions, and expect future research to extend our framework in
this manner. We have added a further element to L160 to further this
point.
Minor comments
The authors response to previous reviews appear to have tidied up the ms
