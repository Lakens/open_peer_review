When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
5
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";

be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article

Comments to the Author:
Please ensure that you revise your manuscript for its language and presentation. You may benefit
from the advice of a language polishing service, examples of which are available at
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/language-polishing/.
The manuscript makes a minor contribution to a measurement system, and no compelling
explanation is provided regarding the value of the work. However, I cannot say it is scientifically
unsound, so I am recommending that it be sent for review.

Comments to the Author:
Thank you for addressing the reviewer concerns. Unfortunately it seems that some parts have
been rewritten so the English language expression is now worse in places than it was. However, I
believe the meaning is clear despite that and I am recommending that the manuscript be
accepted.
Appendix A
Response to the comments of referee
Referee:
The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest
some minor revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the
comments and revise your manuscript.
Response:
We appreciate the reviewer for acknowledging the quality and significance of our
work.
Suggestions for improving the manuscript from reviewer:
Comments of reviewer 1
1.The authors have used the material built in laboratory with cement, gypsum and
pulverized coal to replace coal rock and ratio of similar material is chosen. What is
the basis for selecting the ratio ( the proportion of cement, gypsum, pulverized coal
was 2, 1, 1), in page6 ? Please list the mechanical properties of coal rock.
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion. The main strength parameters of coal rock are compressive
strength and firmness coefficient, while the main deformation indexes are elastic
modulus and Poisson’s ratio. To make the mechanical parameters of coal rock close to
those of similar materials. A experimental program is designed to study the
mechanical parameters of similar materials. The mechanical parameters of coal rock
are measured, its uniaxial compressive strength is 8.53 MPa, tensile strength is 0.63
MPa, elastic modulus is 0.82 GPa, Poisson’s ratio is 0.28 and firmness coefficient is
0.80. Relevant mechanical parameters of coal rock are added in the manuscript.
2.Figure 4 is not clear to see the propagation path of fracturing fluid. Please show a
better one.
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion. A clear picture is placed in the manuscript.
3.In figure 5(d), there are two X- axes, while Y- axes have only one. Axes caption is
incomplete.
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion. Y- axe caption is added in Figure 5d.
4.The articles (a, the, …) used in the manuscript should be revisited.
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion. We have made corrections to make the manuscript more
concise and accurate.

5.In this paper, the authors mentioned “Black spots on the surface of the fractured
specimen will result in blanks in the 3D model”, what is reason of black spot in
scanning process? Please elaborate it.
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion. Since the specimen is made of cement, gypsum and
pulverized coal, there will be black spots upon the surface of fractured specimen.
Black spots on the surface of fractured specimen will result in blanks in the 3D model.
Because the black spots can not be scanned to form 3D model, dye penetrant
inspection materials are used on the specimen to fill these blanks.
6.The author displayed a fractured specimen to describe the characteristics of
hydraulic fracture, what is the experimental condition, such as stress condition,
fracturing flow rate?
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion. The cube specimen was placed under a horizontal stress
difference of 1.50 MPa and the fracturing fluid rate is 3.2 ml/s.
7.The characteristics of hydraulic fracture surface, including shaded relief model of
fractured specimen, a 3D scanning image, a contour map of the fracture surface,
surface area of fractured surface and volume of fractured specimen, was expressed in
the paper. Please explain the details or methods of obtaining them.
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion. The fractured specimen is set upon a rotating platform and
under the OKIO-B non-contact 3D scanner, 3D coordinates are obtained to form 3D
model and processed to produce the surface characteristics of fractured specimen.
Comments of reviewer 2
1.It is expected from the authors to present a more cohesive and comprehensive
literature review, specifically the performed experiments, their goals, and the
obtaining.
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion. The introduction is depicted according to the comment, as
shown in the manuscript.
2.The authors used cement, gypsum and pulverized coal to make experimental
specimen, the mechanical properties of similar materials were displayed, please add
the mechanical properties of coal rock and define “firmness coefficient”.
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion. The mechanical parameters of coal rock are measured, its
uniaxial compressive strength is 8.53 MPa, tensile strength is 0.63 MPa, elastic
2
modulus is 0.82 GPa, Poisson’s ratio is 0.28 and firmness coefficient is 0.80. Relevant
mechanical parameters of coal rock are added in the manuscript. Firmness coefficient
is Protodayakonov’s coefficient and was tested by means of counter balance,
measuring cylinder, sieve, small hammer, funnel and other related devices.
3.Did the authors used manual pressure pumps for in-situ stress simulations?
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion. Yes, the experimental stresses are loaded by manual
pressure pump.
4.The used apparatus should be depicted in detail and its flow rate controlling system,
pumps, accuracy and precision, loading methodology in the true-triaxial cell, and
other details should be explained.
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion. Relevant explanation is added in the manuscript.
5.Fractured specimen (Fig.4) is not shown very well. Please use better photos to show
fracture propagation path.
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion. Fig.4 is replaced by a clear picture in the manuscript.
6.What is the experimental stress?
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion. The horizontal stress difference is 1.50 MPa and fracturing
fluid rate is 3.2 ml/s.
7.Please explain how to deal with the black spots on the surface of fractured
specimen.
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion. Dye penetrant inspection materials are used on the
specimen to fill these blanks.
8.Please explain the details of obtaining fractured model, surface contour map, surface
area and volume of fractured specimen.
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion. The fractured specimen is set upon a rotating platform and
under the OKIO-B non-contact 3D scanner, 3D coordinates are obtained to form 3D
model and processed to produce the surface characteristics of fractured specimen.
9.Improve and clear your explanation on the experimental results. Besides, upgrade
the expression in the manuscript for better understanding.
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion. We checked the whole manuscript to correct errors of
grammar and use for better understanding.
