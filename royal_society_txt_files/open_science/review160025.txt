Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The authors present work demonstrating the significant effect of the CMB on observations of gas
and dust in high-z galaxies (observed at radio to sub-mm wavelengths). The paper makes an
important point, which should indeed be published. However I have several concerns about the
presentation and clarity of the work, which I discuss below.
I first list my major concerns, then move to more minor issues.
——
MAJOR COMMENTS:
- The paper does a poor job of providing analysis to support its (interesting) conclusions. Two
major conclusions of the paper are (i) At high-z, low frequency observations of galaxies (such as
those of CO1-0) will be biased towards small disk sizes, and (ii) At high-z, low frequency
observations of galaxies (such as those of CO1-0) will be biased towards lower velocity
measurements, and hence lower dynamical masses.
These points should be explored further. In the current paper, the authors simply present Fig. 3,
Fig. 5, and Fig. 6, and claim that the conclusions are ‘obvious’. This may be the case, but I would
like to see a deeper than by-eye analysis.
I would suggest that the authors measure (i) disk sizes and (ii) dynamical masses of their
simulated observations. Presenting plots of ‘derived size vs redshift’ and ‘derived dynamical
mass vs redshift’ would make the case for their conclusions far better than simply eyeballing their
existing figures, and would allow the effects they mention to be quantified.
- I would be interested to see if the authors are able to make any specific recommendations to
observers based on their results. In the paper, they simply make vague statements about how
parameters will be underestimated and that recovering these parameters faithfully will require a
‘considerable investment of time’.
I would be greatly interested to know if the authors are able to quantify these statements. For
example, as a function of frequency, what happens to the required integration time to faithfully
recover disk size?
- A further issue (less serious) is that the paper is rather poorly written. I would strongly
recommend that the authors proof read their paper, to avoid the numerous occurrences of
strange grammar and mangled sentences that appear throughout.
——

Specific comments:
- In the abstract, the paper currently says observed sizes shrink at ‘low observing frequencies’ and
enlarge at ‘high frequencies’. This should be more specific — quote the frequencies please.
- I find Fig. 1 confusing. Have the authors mis-labelled their lines? It is claimed that at low
frequencies, dust emission at z=6 is ‘lower’ (I assume the authors mean ‘fainter’) than at z=0.
However, the figure shows the opposite.
- IN §2, I would like to see some more expiation of the physical mechanism by which high-
frequency lines are brightened. Currently, the only explanation given is that ‘temperature
differences no longer linearly translate to brightness differences’. This doesn’t really explain the
effect.
- This is an issue at several points, but the y-axis labels on Fig. 2 are almost illegible. Please make
sure that all axis labels are clear.
- In Fig. 2, I think the inset legend should label frequencies, rather than ALMA bands (the
corresponding ALMA band can be added in parentheses, perhaps).
- §3b, ‘MBB’ should be defined (I think this is the first usage)
- Fig 3. should have the color bar units labeled (the labels themselves are also illegible)
- The authors say they ‘simplify’ dust fitting by fixing beta=2 for all components. Can the authors
comment on this further? What is the standard method? Why do the authors choose a simplified
version?
- In §3b (penultimate paragraph), I do not understand why figures are presented in the source
rest frame (i.e., what an observer at the given redshift would see). Why not present figures as
they appear to a z=0 observer??
- Fig. 5 should have the color bar units labeled.
- Fig. 6 should have the color bar units labeled.
- The conclusions, as it stands, contain some unsupported statements, such as the fact that
enclosed dynamical mass estimates will be biased. The authors have not attempted to show this.
As per my major comment, this is something that deserves further analysis.
- There is a hanging sentence in the conclusions (studies of molecular gas and dust in the early
Universe are.”)

Associate Editor Comments to the Author:
Dear Dr Zhang
Thank you for your resubmitted manuscript. I am pleased to inform you that the paper is
accepted subject to the minor revisions detailed below.
1. Please carefully proof read the paper one more time, possibly enlisting the assistance of a
native English speaker in the author list, to eliminate the remaining few typos and grammatical
errors.
2. A reader may wonder whether choosing to observe higher j CO transitions (eg. CO(6-5)) might
alleviate the problems with size bias at high-z. (referring to Fig. showing line ratios at z=6/z=0 as
a function of z for various lines). Could you please add a comment to the paper to explain
whether or not this would be a good solution.
Kind regards

authors are thankful to the comments from the referee and the help from the editors.
have uploaded the revised version and highlight the changes in boldface.
e are the replies to the comments:
OR COMMENTS:
e paper does a poor job of providing analysis to support its (interesting) conclusions. Two major
clusions of the paper are (i) At high-z, low frequency observations of galaxies (such as those of CO1-0)
be biased towards small disk sizes, and (ii) At high-z, low frequency observations of galaxies (such as
e of CO1-0) will be biased towards lower velocity measurements, and hence lower dynamical masses.
se points should be explored further. In the current paper, the authors simply present Fig. 3, Fig. 5, and
6, and claim that the conclusions are ‘obvious’. This may be the case, but I would like to see a deeper
n by-eye analysis.
wer: - We add two new plots showing the normalised radial distributions of the dust emission and the
emission. In these plots, we also plot the half light radius and 90% light radius, which show the un-
verable size change due to the CMB effect.
would suggest that the authors measure (i) disk sizes and (ii) dynamical masses of their simulated
ervations. Presenting plots of ‘derived size vs redshift’ and ‘derived dynamical mass vs redshift’ would
e the case for their conclusions far better than simply eyeballing their existing figures, and would allow
effects they mention to be quantified.
wer: Our new plots of the radial distributions show the disk size change in both dust and gas emission.
high redshift galaxies, the measurement of dynamical mass often uses Mdyn sin^2 i = 233.5 V ^2 x R,
re i is the inclination angle, V is the line width of line emission, and R is the size of the line (CO or CI)
ssion. The dynamical mass is proportional to the effective radius (size) of the line emission, so the
nking of the CO/CI emission region introduces a smaller dynamical mass.
would be interested to see if the authors are able to make any specific recommendations to observers
ed on their results. In the paper, they simply make vague statements about how parameters will be
erestimated and that recovering these parameters faithfully will require a ‘considerable investment of
e’.
wer: We suggest observers to observe dust continuum in ALMA band-7 where the CMB effect is the
imum for recovering both the flux and the dust continuum distribution. For the line emissions, we
mmend to use CI lines rather than the low-J CO transitions because CI lines are less affected by the
effect. Within the CO transitions, CO J=3-2 is less affected by the CMB effect than the CO J=1-0 and 2-
ansitions.
would be greatly interested to know if the authors are able to quantify these statements. For example, as
nction of frequency, what happens to the required integration time to faithfully recover disk size?
wer: Thanks a lot for pointing it out. Actually we are working on a more realistic simulation with proper
eling of the cosmological dimming, angular size variation, sensitivity consideration, and observational
e, and will use CASA simulator to present the results with reasonable setups of JVLA and ALMA. However
is not easy to be done in a short time and we plan to publish it in a more specific follow-up paper. So in
paper we do not discuss much about it and focus on the physics of the CMB effect.
further issue (less serious) is that the paper is rather poorly written. I would strongly recommend that
authors proof read their paper, to avoid the numerous occurrences of strange grammar and mangled
tences that appear throughout.
wer: We proofread the paper again and changed some sentences in grammar.
cific comments:
the abstract, the paper currently says observed sizes shrink at ‘low observing frequencies’ and enlarge
high frequencies’. This should be more specific — quote the frequencies please.
wer: We add in the frequency ranges.
ind Fig. 1 confusing. Have the authors mis-labelled their lines? It is claimed that at low frequencies, dust
ssion at z=6 is ‘lower’ (I assume the authors mean ‘fainter’) than at z=0. However, the figure shows the
osite.
wer: Sorry we made a mistake that mis-labeled the two lines. Now we have revised it as suggested.
hermore we normalise the plots with the peak of the intrinsic dust emission at z =6, which would help
audiences to see the relative differences.
§2, I would like to see some more expiation of the physical mechanism by which high-frequency lines
brightened. Currently, the only explanation given is that ‘temperature differences no longer linearly
slate to brightness differences’. This doesn’t really explain the effect.
wer: We add more explanation of the physical mechanism.
is is an issue at several points, but the y-axis labels on Fig. 2 are almost illegible. Please make sure that
xis labels are clear.
wer: Thanks much for pointing it out. We revise the labels as suggested.
Fig. 2, I think the inset legend should label frequencies, rather than ALMA bands (the corresponding
A band can be added in parentheses, perhaps).
wer: Thanks much for pointing it out. We revise the labels as suggested.
b, ‘MBB’ should be defined (I think this is the first usage)
wer: MBB appeared earlier, in the end of the first paragraph in Sect. 2
g 3. should have the color bar units labeled (the labels themselves are also illegible)
wer: Thanks! We revise the labels as suggested.
e authors say they ‘simplify’ dust fitting by fixing beta=2 for all components. Can the authors comment
his further? What is the standard method? Why do the authors choose a simplified version?
wer: Fixing beta could show the CMB effect caused by the temperature only, without considering about
degeneracy between dust temperature and beta. Since beta=2 is generally used in high redshift galaxies
ally, we simply by fixing this value. However we do agree that the CMB effect behaves slightly
rently with different beta. A more realistic and detailed study will need to model the multiple-
elength dust emission after the CMB effect, measure the new fluxes and make another fit, and derive a
beta and dust temperature. This is beyond the scope of the current paper which would aims to deliver a
ure of the observable solely affected by the CMB effect.
§3b (penultimate paragraph), I do not understand why figures are presented in the source rest frame
, what an observer at the given redshift would see). Why not present figures as they appear to a z=0
erver??
wer: We choose the source rest frame to focus on the relative change before and after considering the
effects. Comparing models in the source rest frame neglects all the observational based conditions,
, distance, cosmology size change, angular resolution, and telescope sensitivity etc., which will be
eled in details in the follow-up work.
g. 5 should have the color bar units labeled.
wer: Thanks! We revise the labels as suggested.
g. 6 should have the color bar units labeled.
wer: Thanks! We revise the labels as suggested.
e conclusions, as it stands, contain some unsupported statements, such as the fact that enclosed
amical mass estimates will be biased. The authors have not attempted to show this. As per my major
ment, this is something that deserves further analysis.
wer: We add the size change of the gas emission, which causes biases in dynamical mass estimates.
ere is a hanging sentence in the conclusions (studies of molecular gas and dust in the early Universe
”)
wer: Thanks! That is a mistake. We have revised the sentence.
ers: We would like to revise the title to be more correct in English:
