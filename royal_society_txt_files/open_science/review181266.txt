The paper on “Simultaneous Removal of Fluoride and Arsenic in Geothermal Water by Modified
Yak Dung Biochar Adsorbent in Tibet” is interesting, but does not contain anything new, as
compared to thousands of published papers. It is just a routine work and the authors may wish to
think of more specialized journals.
My problem with this paper is that the observed maximum adsorption capacity is very low for
the current adsorbent. The authors did not compare the current adsorbent with already known
ones in the literature. I also do not understand on why the authors only modified BC3 with Fe
and not BC1 and BC2. They should prepare BC1-Fe and BC2 – Fe and then compare their
adsorption properties.
Why focus only on As(V) and not As(III)?
Are the values reported from one experiments or average of a few measurements? Please include
error bars on the graphs.
Overall, the paper is too preliminary and the authors are encouraged to do the complete study
and explain the results.

This paper is about removal of fluoride and arsenic in geothermal water by modified yak dung
biochar adsorbent in Tibet. It can provide an idea to solve the pollution of fluoride and arsenic in
3
geothermal water by using the local resources, and the biochars were characterized by XRD,
FTIR, BET, EDS, and SEM to understand the adsorption process. The results showed that this
method is feasible. The article is well organized and its presentation is good. However, some
minor issues still need to be improved.
(1) Fig.3 and Fig.4 which are about sorption kinetics may not need 3 figures, you can remove one.
(2) Pay attention to a few punctuation and typos errors.
(3) The authors should summarize the deficiencies of experiments and areas need to be

1. In the introduction, the manuscript compared with other researcher’s results on arsenic and
fluorine adsorption in a small way. As I know, the maximum adsorption capacity of BC3 and
BC3-Fe is low and it has no advantage over other adsorbents.
2. In this manuscript, the Yak Dung biochar was modified by FeCl2, the modification method is
not innovative compared with others' research.
3. SEM<U+3001>BET<U+3001>XRD<U+3001>EDS<U+3001>FTIR and so on was used to understand the mechanism of
adsorption, but the authors did not compare them each other. Usually, The comparison between

Major Comment
• I am little bit concerned about the results of BC2 for fluoride in figure 1(b). It is showing better
performance at pH 5-6, which means for the case of fluoride it can be used as a next choice after
7
BC3. How about conducting one side experiment for BC2 for FeCl2 absorption at pH 5-6? I want
to know why you excluded these result findings from your experiment?
Minor comments
• In the introduction part, there are some grammatical errors and mistakes. Few examples are as
follows;
i. In the first line of introduction, replace resources <U+2192> resource
ii. Rephrase “housing heating” <U+2192> heating houses
iii. Please use full abbreviation for World Health Organization first than use its short form
(WHO).
iv. As (III) is not written in figure 1 description. It is showing blank space instead.
v. It is highly recommended to avail the proof reading services of native English speakers or
English editorial services for grammatical corrections.

RESPONS TO REVIEWERS COMMENTS
Dear editor,
Thanks for considering our research manuscript for review. The
manuscript was thoroughly studied and revised per suggestions given
by reviewers. The replies to both reviewers are listed below. The
comments of first and second are highlighted as red and blue,
respectively.
Reviewer #1:
1. My problem with this paper is that the observed maximum
adsorption capacity is very low for the current adsorbent. The
authors did not compare the current adsorbent with already known
ones in the literature.
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. The purpose of this work is to
provide an idea to solve the pollution of fluoride and arsenic in
geothermal water by using the local resources in Tibet.So yak dung is
chosen as the initial material and the cheap substance FeCl2 was
chosen as the iron source. Maybe the amount of iron loaded on biochar
was needed to further studied to increase its adsorption capacity.
2. I also do not understand on why the authors only modified BC3
with Fe and not BC1 and BC2. They should prepare BC1-Fe and
BC2 – Fe and then compare their adsorption properties.
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. The effect of removing F and As
by BC1 and BC2 are not well compared with BC3, so only the BC3
was modified with Fe.
3. Why focus only on As (V) and not As (III)?
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. In fact, As (V) and As (III) are all
studied and the removal effects of them are same, while considering
that the existence of most arsenic in nature is arsenate, so As (V) was
the final research object in this work.
4. Are the values reported from one experiments or average of a few
measurements?
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. The values are from three times
of measurements and we added this expression in the experiment part.
5. Please include error bars on the graphs.
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. The error bars are included on
graphs, but the ordinate value is too large for some graphs so some
error bars are not displayed.
Reviewer #2:
1. Fig.3 and Fig.4 which are about sorption kinetics may not need 3
figures, you can remove one.
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. The first graphs of Fig.3 and
Fig.4 have been deleted.
2. Pay attention to a few punctuation and typos errors.
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. We have carefully checked the
grammar, typos and punctuation and some modifications were made
which was marked in red.
3. The authors should summarize the deficiencies of experiments and
areas need to be improved.
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. The part 4 conclusion of the
manuscript has been changed into conclusion and expectation, and
summarized the areas needs to be improved in the future.
Appendix B
RESPONS TO REVIEWERS COMMENTS
Dear editor,
Thanks for considering our research manuscript for review. The
manuscript was thoroughly studied and revised per suggestions given
by reviewers. The replies to both reviewers are listed below. The
comments of third and fourth are highlighted as red and blue,
respectively.
Reviewer #3:
1. In the introduction, the manuscript compared with other
researcher’s results on arsenic and fluorine adsorption in a small
way. As I know, the maximum adsorption capacity of BC3 and
BC3-Fe is low and it has no advantage over other adsorbents.
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. As far as we know, our research
is the first try to use yak dung as raw material to produce biochar for
removing arsenic and fluorine in geothermal water in Tibet. Although
the adsorption capacity is not high compared with other adsorbents,
this research provides an idea to solve the local environmental problem
using local resources in Tibet. We will continue our study and try to
increase the adsorption capacity by different modification methods.
2. In this manuscript, the Yak Dung biochar was modified by FeCl2,
the modification method is not innovative compared with others'
research.
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. The reason we choose FeCl2 to
modified biochar is because FeCl2 is cheaper and more available than
other materials. And this is a preliminary exploration work and we
have also research AlCl3 as the iron source but the results were low
than FeCl2, we will continue to research other materials in the future.
3. SEM<U+3001>BET<U+3001>XRD<U+3001>EDS<U+3001>FTIR and so on was used to understand
the mechanism of adsorption, but the authors did not compare
them each other. Usually, The comparison between
representational analysis results is used to verify the validity.
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. We added the comparison of the
characterization methods to verify the validity of our results in the
revised manuscript.
4. Above all, the manuscript does not have enough innovation and
highlights.
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. Yak dung is an abundant specific
biomass resource in Tibet, and is often used as fuel or stacked
outdoors, which will cause serious air pollution and the waste of
resources. This research provides an idea and a basic theory to solve
the pollution of fluoride and arsenic in geothermal water by using the
local resources in Tibet. As far as we know, our research is the first try
to solve the local environmental problem using local resources in
Tibet.
Reviewer #4:
1. I am little bit concerned about the results of BC2 for fluoride
in figure 1(b). It is showing better performance at pH 5-6,
which means for the case of fluoride it can be used as a next
choice after BC3. How about conducting one side experiment
for BC2 for FeCl2 absorption at pH 5-6? I want to know why
you excluded these result findings from your experiment?
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. Although BC2 performs as well
as BC3 at pH 5-6, it does not perform well under other pH. And the
specific surface areas of BC1, BC2 and BC3 were characterized when
we finished research the effect of pH. The result was as Table 3, the
surface area of BC1 was 37.944m2/g, the BC2 was 49.687m2/g and the
BC3 was 100.316m2/g which was far greater than the other two
biochars. So we choose BC3 to do the following research.
2. In the introduction part, there are some grammatical errors and
mistakes. Few examples are as follows;
i. In the first line of introduction, replace resources <U+2192>
resource
ii. Rephrase “housing heating” <U+2192> heating houses
iii. Please use full abbreviation for World Health
Organization first than use its short form (WHO).
iv. As (III) is not written in figure 1 description. It is
showing blank space instead.
v. It is highly recommended to avail the proof reading
services of native English speakers or English editorial
services for grammatical corrections.
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. We have corrected the
grammatical errors and mistakes and also the manuscript has been
revised by the editing service of webshop.
And As (III) has been written in figure 1 description.
