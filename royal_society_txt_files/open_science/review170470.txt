Beside some points discussed below, the article is clearly written. It does not strike me as having
a lot of truly novel content, but it does bring together different strands of thought in a potentially
useful way. At moments, the manuscript however lacks prudence, making claims that appear too
strong/general or inadequately supported (specific examples below). This could however be
addressed fairly easily.
SPECIFIC POINTS
Section 2.1, 1st sentence: "Systems biology and the gene regulatory network approach undermine
the idea that the effects of mutations, especially – in our case – mutations that occur in
carcinogenesis, could be considered as additive." -> please provide references to this effect. The
point is actually not so obvious, for 2 reasons: 1) there are clear reasons why modularity would be
favored by evolution, as well as evidence for conserved mechanisms of modularity in gene
expression regulation, and 2) the current estimates of epistasis in eQTL (with all caveats attached
to it) are far below expectations from a priori gene regulatory networks.
p.2, tone down the following statement:
"Every pre-cancerous cell that acquires a single mutation in an ONG is thus effectively trapped
within an evolutionary cul-de-sac because no particular pathway confers a net selective
advantage"
-> there are clear cases (at least in animal models) where a single mutation causes cancer, they are
just very few. I suggest changing "Every" to "In the vast majority of cases"
"As we will see, the prospect of the attractor landscape eventually emphasizes the non-genetic
origin of tumour and metastatic phenotype."
-> I failed to see this implication in your paper, you yourself even write that the cell's epigenetic
landscape can be modified by mutations...
p.2: "a phenomenon usually defined as clonal interference" -> this passage is ambiguous. What
you actually describe could also be called fixation, depending on (expected) fitness. If you want
to keep the passage, please clarify.
P2, bottom: the distinction between intra-cellular and intercellular is misleading (cell signaling
spans both sides of the cell membrane). I would suggest replacing with the (philosophically
problematic but scientifically more robust) distinction between cell-autonomous and non-cell-
autonomous.
P3, top: "All these examples mark a conceptual shift from a view of the cancer cell achieving a
number of functions to a view of the cell that loses the capability to cooperate effectively with the
other cells in the tissue and in the body."
-> While I actually tend to agree, this transition is made in a very odd way, given that your
passage on EMT ends with the cells hijacking a program that grants it several functions (e.g.
migration capacity). This makes the statement seem less convincing than it actually is.
Section 3, 2nd paragraph: Peto's paradox is treated too lightly and this whole passage is rather
unconvincing. It is not clear at all why kin selection - rather than individual-level selection -
would be needed. What would prevent, in the absence of kin selection, a species with high
3
(reproductive) longevity to evolve tighter cancer protection mechanisms? If cancer risk does not
correlate with post-reproductive longevity, wouldn't this argue against both individual and kin-
selection?
p.6 top:
"Cancer cannot be explained as a result of selection acting on cells, because cells cannot develop
complex adaptations" -> as it is, the passage is misleading and the argument is flawed, because it
misses a premise, namely that cancer cells display complex traits. Germain (2012) actually makes
the argument that beside carcinogenesis itself, there does not seem to be such complex adaptions.
Please clarify this passage.
P.6: "Could the supposed selective pressures that act in different phases – healthy organ,
carcinogenesis, metastasis – really be selecting for the same features?"
It seems pretty clear that not all selective pressures are the same across phases, but you seem to
suggest that none is, which I think is clearly wrong. For instance, I do not think there is any
cancer-relevant microenvironment in which any of these is beneficial to the fitness of the cell:
1) being dependent on external growth signaling
2) being subjected to immune recognition
3) undergoing programmed death or senescence
I would therefore recommend editing this passage to avoid misleading conclusions.
"However, during the stochastic evolution of cancer it has proved impossible to establish a direct
causal relationship between environmental and specific genetic/epigenetic factors." (p.6)
-> This is plainly false. Loss of receptors following treatment is a clear example of an
environmental factor driving the establishment of a genetic alteration. Change "impossible" to
merely "difficult", or clarify what you want to say.
End of section 4:
"If carcinogenesis is the explanandum, any reference to inter-cellular somatic natural selection
seems to be little more than an ad hoc addition to an explanatory theory unable to properly
define functions, nor to distinguish them from dysfunctions."
I'm afraid I haven't understood this sentence properly. Given that it seems to be a very bold
statement and concludes your section, I think it would be important to clarify it.
Section 5, 1st sentence:
"As we have seen, believing that somatic evolution drives the multi-step process that produces a
metastatic cancer encounters more than one difficulty."
This is a problematic statement, especially given the unclear meaning of "driving" an
evolutionary process (cf Lewontin). I'd recommend rephrasing.
Section 5, 2nd paragraph: I don't think "revolutionized" is appropriate here. (Strictly speaking
these 'views' pop up in many moments of the past century, and I'd tend to think that if they are
more successful today it is mostly because of technical advances and of having already reaped
the low-hanging fruits of the cell-autonomous components of cancer).
More generally on section 5: like many others, I tend to think that perpetuating a false dichotomy
between TOFT and somatic evolution is counter-productive. Fortunately you do not go much in
this direction, but it seems to me that you are poised to do one more contribution, namely to
explain how the two can be articulated. For instance, there are all reasons to think that mutations
in single cells can in many (not not all) cases provide the "aberrant stimuli affecting the
coordination" of the tissue. In this sense, TOFT would represent a more global explanatory
framework that would include and encompass, rather than deny, the (admittedly local and non-
sufficient) explanatory power of genetics-centered views.

Conclusion:
"evolutionary thinking is fundamental in cancer research, but the somatic selection model has
serious shortcomings and a domain of validity that is probably limited to the final phases of
cancer progression."
I find that putting it in terms of domain of validity most useful, but this strikes me as too strong.
You have built a convincing case against the power of somatic evolution to explain cancer
initiation, but you jump rather too quickly to restricting it to metastasis. There are countless cases
in which cancer growth and progression seem in line with a somatic selection model, whereas I
agree that initiation is quite problematic. I would therefore suggest to nuance a bit in this
direction.
You close with the following statement:
"However, taking inspiration from cancer research, we could perhaps go back to evolutionary
theory and look for models that assume prosociality, several kinds of altruism, unselfish
behaviours etc. as natural states that shift the explanatory efforts, sometimes even inverting
explananda and explanantia, namely what needs explanantion and what is meant to be
explanatory." (p.10)
I find this statement and analogy most problematic, as it suggests a symmetry when there is
none. In the case of cancer, what counts as the default state (whatever that is supposed to means)
or explanandum is ambiguous and seems a matter of perspective because there are two types of
transitions that need explanation and that are potentially intertwined: 1) from the proliferative
cells we ultimately descend from to the quiescent somatic cells, and 2) from quiescent somatic
cells to cancer cells. Assuming a proliferative state seems particularly fruitful because growth is a
characterizing feature of all cells, including those we descend from. However, in the case of
evolutionary transitions, so-called prosociality is always evolutionary second. We have loads of
reasons and empirical evidence (including mere parciomny) arguing against a default
prosociality. While this should not prevent us from considering the view, suggesting a symmetry
between them is misleading and potentially dangerous.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The manuscript challenges the ability of somatic evolution (SE) framework to explain
development of caner, arguing that alternative frameworks, including considerations of gene
regulatory networks and “field” theory represent better alternatives.
It focuses on a very important and under-explored subject, highlighting the notion that salient
properties of cancer origin and progression cannot be completely reduced to the SE framework;
considerations of gene regulatory networks and tissue level homeostasis could offer useful
complementary perspectives. However, instead of synthesizing, authors instead choose to
counterpose SE (which they challenge) with GRN and tissue-level considerations (which they
champion). The problem is that they are attacking a straw man instead of SE, displaying lack of
familiarity with biological facts, misunderstanding of some key ideas (including egregious
misunderstanding that fitness is by definition context dependent), and having some gaps of logic
in the argument being built
Throughout the paper, authors base their case on unsupported statements presented as facts or
common knowledge, which really fly in the face of not only established ideas, but also well-
established facts.
Specifically:
1) Line 26, p.1 : “However, proto-tumoral and tumoral features in precancerous cells that would
undergo ‘natural selection’ have proven hard to find” - this is simply not true. Demonstration of
functional consequences of activating an oncogene or inactivating of a tumor suppressor genes is
essentially a requirement for most of experimental cancer biology papers - literally tens of
thousands of published papers. Whereas most of the studies are done in experimental systems
that might not offer an ideal recapitulation of pre-cancerous tissues and do not look at differential
fitness explicitly, there are plenty of high quality studies which clearly demonstrated this. For
example, 10.1126/science.1243148 describes fitness effect of mutations of Apc loss, Kras
activation, and P53 mutations in intestinal epithelia.
2) This unsupported assertion is echoed later in “Every pre-cancerous cell that acquires a single
mutation in an ONG is thus effectively trapped within an evolutionary cul-de-sac because no
particular pathway confers a net selective advantage: the intrinsic suppressive activity for growth
within each pathway is controlled by another pathway, adjusting the proliferative potential of
cells” - this categorical statement is not grounded in reality. Granted, evolution of multicellularity
necessitated development of multiple levels of tumor suppression, limiting selective advantage of
initiating oncogenic mutations, but these protective mechanisms are not fail-proof. For example,
normal skin contains many clones that bear ONG mutations and display clear evidence of
expansion (10.1126/science.aaa6806). In experimental cancer research, introduction of ONG
mutations is widely and successfully used as a tool to induce cancers, for example
(10.1038/nature13902). Thus, authors statements seem to be way out of touch with reality. It is
6
reasonable to argue that initiating oncogenic mutations are likely to be insufficient to cause
cancers, but this insufficiency is not equivalent to cul de sac.
3) doi: 10.1038/srep20707“.. even if one cancer cell fulfills some criteria for being a replicator, it
does not seem to be a paradigmatic Darwinian individual: in fact, much of the fitness differences
do not depend on intrinsic features but more on external ones, such as position, dimension,
nutrients and so on. How much a cancer cell replicates depends strongly on its environment. This
is the main reason why we cannot consider a cancer cell as a paradigmatic Darwinian
individual.” I found this egregious, this assertion betrays the lack of understanding of the the
very basic foundations of Darwinian evolution. The very etymology of term “fitness” conveys
context dependence. Both original Darwinian theory and contemporary post-synthesis
evolutionary theory have the context-dependence of fitness/selection as a corner stone. Granted,
some prominent cancer biologists (such as Bert Vogelstein), hold extremely gene-centric views
similar to those of some geneticists pre-synthesis, but they are not operating within the SE
framework, focusing more on proximal causation. Still, context dependence receives significant
consideration in the cancer research community (see doi: 10.1038/srep20707, 10.1038/nrc1674,
10.1016/j.bbcan.2017.01.006. ), as it is impossible to apply Darwinian logic without considering
context
4) "In this later phase, increase in cell number is a key factor because a mutation stabilizes and
becomes advantageous within a population of individuals, a phenomenon usually defined as
clonal interference (11)”. Authors appear to invent a definition that has nothing to do with the
conventional meaning of this term, coined by Richard Lenski
(http://lenski.mmg.msu.edu/lenski/pdf/1998,%20Genetica,%20Gerrish%20&%20Lenski.pdf).
Clonal interference is influence of other mutations present in a population of competing
individuals on trajectory of a given mutation to a fixation.
5) "To conform to such locality, evolutionary models of cancer articulate evolutionary theory in
terms of fitness (cells proliferation) vs. ‘real adaptation’ – which would go beyond the local
immediate context.” This statement does not make sense. Fitness is essentially a metric of
adaptation, I do not see how they can be uncoupled. Authors state as if this uncoupling
represents an established concept in evolutionary models (apparently without even a need to be
references) - but it is not, certainly not in the mainstream literature on the subject.
6) “Only in states where the relatively stable karyotype does not change, can genetic mutations
and epigenetic adjustments play a dominant role, similar to what occurs during adaptive micro-
evolution”, later echoed in “ In fact, only where functional states and properties are relatively
stable is specificity possible. For example, only in states where the karyotype is relatively stable
(e.g., in development), can genetic mutations and epigenetic adjustments play a dominant and
determinant role.”. This statement makes sense from a first principles, as without heritability
mutations and epigenetic adjustments would be immaterial - but this is another case of
completely ignoring facts on the ground. Experimentally, one can introduce mutations and
up/down-regulation of gene expression (modeling epigenetic changes) - with strong,
reproducible and measurable consequences. Cancer genomes are certainly less stable that those of
the normal tissues, but they are not completely unstable either. For example, most of established
caner cell lines maintain their karyotpye for numbers of generations, that would be sufficient to
generate number of cells far exceeding those found in the advanced decease, even when starting
from a single cells. Same is true for serial passaging of primary tumor sample in xenograft
tumors.
7) First paragraph of page 7 attacks a straw-man. The widespread use of cell lines for cancer
research is not because experimentalists are too dim to understand that these models do not
necessarily recapitulate situation in vivo. Using a famous phrase by Georege Box “ All models are
wrong, but some are useful” - it would be difficult to find a scientist who would disagree with
this statement. Cell culture models are a useful first step for experimental studies, typically
7
followed up by validation using in vivo mouse models and analysis of human patient samples.
There is no meaningful shortcut.
Also, there are some logical gaps in the presentation of the ideas and arguments:
1) Line 28, page 1: “Contemporary systems theories in cancer research consider the notion of
‘field’ as an alternative source of cell cooperation” - alternative to what? Previous sentences
talked about somatic evolution - which is orthogonal to sources of cell cooperation.
2) First paragraph of page 2 - I agree that system biology view offered by GRN provides a more
accurate framework to conceptualize signaling cascades and genetic networks, but what does it
have to do with somatic evolution?
3) I do not see how considerations of attractor landscape can “emphasize the non-genetic origin
of tumor and metastatic phenotype” - viewing distinct phenotypes as attractor states in GRN is a
reasonable way to conceptualize what phenotypes are - but this view by no means refutes the
importance of genetic mutations, which can significantly reshape this landscape.
4) " Cancer cannot be explained as a result of selection acting on cells, because cells cannot
develop complex adaptations: cells adaptations are limited to the possibilities offered by their
molecular architecture” I am not sure what authors are trying to convey by this statement. If they
imply that natural selection must produce complex adaptations, this is definitely wrong -
complex adaptations are not pre-requisite outcome of the action of natural selection.
Alternatively, the sentence might imply that cancers display complex adaptations that cannot be
explained by natural selection - I think this statement is flawed as well, but authors need to at
least articulate what complex adaptations do they imply here.
5) "This means that, even if we agree on the dependence of cancer cell fitness on external factors,
we could interpret that as a mark of multi-level selection occurring during the development of
cancer. Cancer could therefore be seen as an example of a multi-level selection process: it is both a
byproduct and subject to selection”. - The idea that constraining somatic evolution by organismal
level selection is widely accepted within cancer research community - I do not see how this
conflicts with cancer developing as a result of clonal evolution.
6) I do not see how “wiring of healthy cells” be considered as mutually exclusive with natural
selection. Natural selection acts on heritable phenotypes, available in populations. Wiring of
healthy cells underlies phenotypes of healthy cells, mutational and heritable epimutational
changes either unlock some phenotypic features that are not accessible to normal somatic cells of
a given tissue (such as those related to embryonic development) or create novel wiring, which is
not encountered in normal cells (such as mutations in RAS, or many of the fusion oncogenes that
create a kinase with abnormal activity that leads to phosphorylation levels not encountered in
any normal context).
7) “Could the supposed selective pressures that act in different phases – healthy organ,
carcinogenesis, metastasis – really be selecting for the same features” - The phrasing is fairly
sloppy here - none of the listed entities I hope that authors mean selective pressures acting at
different stages of cancer development here, as otherwise it will not make sense - but even then I
do not see how this would contradict SE framework.
7) “ leads to the idea that tissue level autonomous mechanisms dominate, and are mediated by,
cell-cell interactions rather than by gene-gene relationships.” - counterposition of cell-cell
communication and gene-gene communication represents a false dichotomy, as it refers to
different levels of organization. Changes in gene interactions are responsible for changes in cell-
cell interactions.
8
8) "In any case, the malignant phenotype is not a complete cellular reinvention, but rather one of
the states potentially existing in the cell”. - absolutely agree - but how does it conflict SE
framework?
9) "Somatic evolution is therefore seen as a co-evolution between cells and their
microenvironment” - even though this statement is in line with fairly common misconception,
give authors background, they should have been able to the semantical trap. Somatic evolution
refers to heritable changes in populations of cancer cells - evolution of microenvironment is a
different category - environment does change
10) "In addition, due to the irreversible nature of genetic mutation, it is also difficult to explain
how certain metastases remain dormant and can form links with the normal surrounding tissues”
- no it is not. Phenotype is not strictly linked with genotype, instead a give genotype enables a
wider range of phenotypic manifestations - think of diversity of cells in our body that have the
same genotypes. However, genetic mutations can influence the range of phenotypes available to
a cell.
11) "According to this model, tissues and organs are embedded in an extracellular matrix
(ECM)/basement membrane (BM) that provide them structural support and contextual
information along with soluble factors”. What is stated is a biological fact, taught in histology 101
- rather than a theory of a specific model.
12) “Now it is clear, from new epistemological assumptions and from empirical evidence, that the
solid tumor microenvironment/architecture may in fact significantly contribute to the emergence
of therapeutic resistance” - the statement is correct, but how does it conflict with SE framework?
Microenvironment and tissue architecture shape selective pressures experienced by tumor cells,
much like ecological variables influence selection in natural populations.
General comments:
1) It will be useful to have a more clear logical structure for the paper - the chain of
thought/argument is somewhat loose.
2) It would have been useful to add a glossary of definitions of terms, such as attractor landscape
and similar terms that do not have a universally accepted, unambiguous definition.
There are some sentences whose meaning escapes me.
1) “Several specifications should be made for a complete exposition of cancer research under a
Somatic Evolution framework” - what does it mean? Having next sentence starting with “for
example” makes it even more confusing.
2) "However, during the stochastic evolution of cancer it has proved impossible to establish a
direct causal relationship between environmental and specific genetic/epigenetic factors" - not
sure what authors mean here - worth elaborating.
Minor comments:
"At the level of the organism, cancer is usually lethal, so that it is plausible that a number of genes
and tissue organization mechanisms that suppress cancer might have been developed (18,19)” -
plausible seems to be a gross understatement.
“..and then very complex biological systems (such as ourselves!), which are composed of millions
of cells” - authors are off by 2 orders of magnitude, human body have trillions of cells.

suggest that none is, which I think is clearly wrong. For instance, I do not think there is any
12
cancer-relevant microenvironment in which any of these is beneficial to the fitness of the cell:
1) being dependent on external growth signaling
2) being subjected to immune recognition
3) undergoing programmed death or senescence
I would therefore recommend editing this passage to avoid misleading conclusions.
"However, during the stochastic evolution of cancer it has proved impossible to establish a direct
causal relationship between environmental and specific genetic/epigenetic factors." (p.6)
-> This is plainly false. Loss of receptors following treatment is a clear example of an
environmental factor driving the establishment of a genetic alteration. Change "impossible" to
merely "difficult", or clarify what you want to say.
End of section 4:
"If carcinogenesis is the explanandum, any reference to inter-cellular somatic natural selection
seems to be little more than an ad hoc addition to an explanatory theory unable to properly
define functions, nor to distinguish them from dysfunctions."
I'm afraid I haven't understood this sentence properly. Given that it seems to be a very bold
statement and concludes your section, I think it would be important to clarify it.
Section 5, 1st sentence:
"As we have seen, believing that somatic evolution drives the multi-step process that produces a
metastatic cancer encounters more than one difficulty."
This is a problematic statement, especially given the unclear meaning of "driving" an
evolutionary process (cf Lewontin). I'd recommend rephrasing.
Section 5, 2nd paragraph: I don't think "revolutionized" is appropriate here. (Strictly speaking
these 'views' pop up in many moments of the past century, and I'd tend to think that if they are
more successful today it is mostly because of technical advances and of having already reaped
the low-hanging fruits of the cell-autonomous components of cancer).
More generally on section 5: like many others, I tend to think that perpetuating a false dichotomy
between TOFT and somatic evolution is counter-productive. Fortunately you do not go much in
this direction, but it seems to me that you are poised to do one more contribution, namely to
explain how the two can be articulated. For instance, there are all reasons to think that mutations
in single cells can in many (not not all) cases provide the "aberrant stimuli affecting the
coordination" of the tissue. In this sense, TOFT would represent a more global explanatory
framework that would include and encompass, rather than deny, the (admittedly local and non-
sufficient) explanatory power of genetics-centered views.
Conclusion:
"evolutionary thinking is fundamental in cancer research, but the somatic selection model has
serious shortcomings and a domain of validity that is probably limited to the final phases of
cancer progression."
I find that putting it in terms of domain of validity most useful, but this strikes me as too strong.
You have built a convincing case against the power of somatic evolution to explain cancer
initiation, but you jump rather too quickly to restricting it to metastasis. There are countless cases
in which cancer growth and progression seem in line with a somatic selection model, whereas I
agree that initiation is quite problematic. I would therefore suggest to nuance a bit in this
direction.
You close with the following statement:
"However, taking inspiration from cancer research, we could perhaps go back to evolutionary
theory and look for models that assume prosociality, several kinds of altruism, unselfish
behaviours etc. as natural states that shift the explanatory efforts, sometimes even inverting
explananda and explanantia, namely what needs explanantion and what is meant to be
explanatory." (p.10)
13
I find this statement and analogy most problematic, as it suggests a symmetry when there is
none. In the case of cancer, what counts as the default state (whatever that is supposed to means)
or explanandum is ambiguous and seems a matter of perspective because there are two types of
transitions that need explanation and that are potentially intertwined: 1) from the proliferative
cells we ultimately descend from to the quiescent somatic cells, and 2) from quiescent somatic
cells to cancer cells. Assuming a proliferative state seems particularly fruitful because growth is a
characterizing feature of all cells, including those we descend from. However, in the case of
evolutionary transitions, so-called prosociality is always evolutionary second. We have loads of
reasons and empirical evidence (including mere parciomny) arguing against a default
prosociality. While this should not prevent us from considering the view, suggesting a symmetry
between them is misleading and potentially dangerous.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript challenges the ability of somatic evolution (SE) framework to explain
development of caner, arguing that alternative frameworks, including considerations of gene
regulatory networks and “field” theory represent better alternatives.
It focuses on a very important and under-explored subject, highlighting the notion that salient
properties of cancer origin and progression cannot be completely reduced to the SE framework;
considerations of gene regulatory networks and tissue level homeostasis could offer useful
complementary perspectives. However, instead of synthesizing, authors instead choose to
counterpose SE (which they challenge) with GRN and tissue-level considerations (which they
champion). The problem is that they are attacking a straw man instead of SE, displaying lack of
familiarity with biological facts, misunderstanding of some key ideas (including egregious
misunderstanding that fitness is by definition context dependent), and having some gaps of logic
in the argument being built
Throughout the paper, authors base their case on unsupported statements presented as facts or
common knowledge, which really fly in the face of not only established ideas, but also well-
established facts.
Specifically:
1) Line 26, p.1 : “However, proto-tumoral and tumoral features in precancerous cells that would
undergo ‘natural selection’ have proven hard to find” - this is simply not true. Demonstration of
functional consequences of activating an oncogene or inactivating of a tumor suppressor genes is
essentially a requirement for most of experimental cancer biology papers - literally tens of
thousands of published papers. Whereas most of the studies are done in experimental systems
that might not offer an ideal recapitulation of pre-cancerous tissues and do not look at differential
fitness explicitly, there are plenty of high quality studies which clearly demonstrated this. For
example, 10.1126/science.1243148 describes fitness effect of mutations of Apc loss, Kras
activation, and P53 mutations in intestinal epithelia.
2) This unsupported assertion is echoed later in “Every pre-cancerous cell that acquires a single
mutation in an ONG is thus effectively trapped within an evolutionary cul-de-sac because no
particular pathway confers a net selective advantage: the intrinsic suppressive activity for growth
14
within each pathway is controlled by another pathway, adjusting the proliferative potential of
cells” - this categorical statement is not grounded in reality. Granted, evolution of multicellularity
necessitated development of multiple levels of tumor suppression, limiting selective advantage of
initiating oncogenic mutations, but these protective mechanisms are not fail-proof. For example,
normal skin contains many clones that bear ONG mutations and display clear evidence of
expansion (10.1126/science.aaa6806). In experimental cancer research, introduction of ONG
mutations is widely and successfully used as a tool to induce cancers, for example
(10.1038/nature13902). Thus, authors statements seem to be way out of touch with reality. It is
reasonable to argue that initiating oncogenic mutations are likely to be insufficient to cause
cancers, but this insufficiency is not equivalent to cul de sac.
3) doi: 10.1038/srep20707“.. even if one cancer cell fulfills some criteria for being a replicator, it
does not seem to be a paradigmatic Darwinian individual: in fact, much of the fitness differences
do not depend on intrinsic features but more on external ones, such as position, dimension,
nutrients and so on. How much a cancer cell replicates depends strongly on its environment. This
is the main reason why we cannot consider a cancer cell as a paradigmatic Darwinian
individual.” I found this egregious, this assertion betrays the lack of understanding of the the
very basic foundations of Darwinian evolution. The very etymology of term “fitness” conveys
context dependence. Both original Darwinian theory and contemporary post-synthesis
evolutionary theory have the context-dependence of fitness/selection as a corner stone. Granted,
some prominent cancer biologists (such as Bert Vogelstein), hold extremely gene-centric views
similar to those of some geneticists pre-synthesis, but they are not operating within the SE
framework, focusing more on proximal causation. Still, context dependence receives significant
consideration in the cancer research community (see doi: 10.1038/srep20707, 10.1038/nrc1674,
10.1016/j.bbcan.2017.01.006. ), as it is impossible to apply Darwinian logic without considering
context
4) "In this later phase, increase in cell number is a key factor because a mutation stabilizes and
becomes advantageous within a population of individuals, a phenomenon usually defined as
clonal interference (11)”. Authors appear to invent a definition that has nothing to do with the
conventional meaning of this term, coined by Richard Lenski
(http://lenski.mmg.msu.edu/lenski/pdf/1998,%20Genetica,%20Gerrish%20&%20Lenski.pdf).
Clonal interference is influence of other mutations present in a population of competing
individuals on trajectory of a given mutation to a fixation.
5) "To conform to such locality, evolutionary models of cancer articulate evolutionary theory in
terms of fitness (cells proliferation) vs. ‘real adaptation’ – which would go beyond the local
immediate context.” This statement does not make sense. Fitness is essentially a metric of
adaptation, I do not see how they can be uncoupled. Authors state as if this uncoupling
represents an established concept in evolutionary models (apparently without even a need to be
references) - but it is not, certainly not in the mainstream literature on the subject.
6) “Only in states where the relatively stable karyotype does not change, can genetic mutations
and epigenetic adjustments play a dominant role, similar to what occurs during adaptive micro-
evolution”, later echoed in “ In fact, only where functional states and properties are relatively
stable is specificity possible. For example, only in states where the karyotype is relatively stable
(e.g., in development), can genetic mutations and epigenetic adjustments play a dominant and
determinant role.”. This statement makes sense from a first principles, as without heritability
mutations and epigenetic adjustments would be immaterial - but this is another case of
completely ignoring facts on the ground. Experimentally, one can introduce mutations and
up/down-regulation of gene expression (modeling epigenetic changes) - with strong,
reproducible and measurable consequences. Cancer genomes are certainly less stable that those of
the normal tissues, but they are not completely unstable either. For example, most of established
caner cell lines maintain their karyotpye for numbers of generations, that would be sufficient to
generate number of cells far exceeding those found in the advanced decease, even when starting
from a single cells. Same is true for serial passaging of primary tumor sample in xenograft
15
tumors.
7) First paragraph of page 7 attacks a straw-man. The widespread use of cell lines for cancer
research is not because experimentalists are too dim to understand that these models do not
necessarily recapitulate situation in vivo. Using a famous phrase by Georege Box “ All models are
wrong, but some are useful” - it would be difficult to find a scientist who would disagree with
this statement. Cell culture models are a useful first step for experimental studies, typically
followed up by validation using in vivo mouse models and analysis of human patient samples.
There is no meaningful shortcut.
Also, there are some logical gaps in the presentation of the ideas and arguments:
1) Line 28, page 1: “Contemporary systems theories in cancer research consider the notion of
‘field’ as an alternative source of cell cooperation” - alternative to what? Previous sentences
talked about somatic evolution - which is orthogonal to sources of cell cooperation.
2) First paragraph of page 2 - I agree that system biology view offered by GRN provides a more
accurate framework to conceptualize signaling cascades and genetic networks, but what does it
have to do with somatic evolution?
3) I do not see how considerations of attractor landscape can “emphasize the non-genetic origin
of tumor and metastatic phenotype” - viewing distinct phenotypes as attractor states in GRN is a
reasonable way to conceptualize what phenotypes are - but this view by no means refutes the
importance of genetic mutations, which can significantly reshape this landscape.
4) " Cancer cannot be explained as a result of selection acting on cells, because cells cannot
develop complex adaptations: cells adaptations are limited to the possibilities offered by their
molecular architecture” I am not sure what authors are trying to convey by this statement. If they
imply that natural selection must produce complex adaptations, this is definitely wrong -
complex adaptations are not pre-requisite outcome of the action of natural selection.
Alternatively, the sentence might imply that cancers display complex adaptations that cannot be
explained by natural selection - I think this statement is flawed as well, but authors need to at
least articulate what complex adaptations do they imply here.
5) "This means that, even if we agree on the dependence of cancer cell fitness on external factors,
we could interpret that as a mark of multi-level selection occurring during the development of
cancer. Cancer could therefore be seen as an example of a multi-level selection process: it is both a
byproduct and subject to selection”. - The idea that constraining somatic evolution by organismal
level selection is widely accepted within cancer research community - I do not see how this
conflicts with cancer developing as a result of clonal evolution.
6) I do not see how “wiring of healthy cells” be considered as mutually exclusive with natural
selection. Natural selection acts on heritable phenotypes, available in populations. Wiring of
healthy cells underlies phenotypes of healthy cells, mutational and heritable epimutational
changes either unlock some phenotypic features that are not accessible to normal somatic cells of
a given tissue (such as those related to embryonic development) or create novel wiring, which is
not encountered in normal cells (such as mutations in RAS, or many of the fusion oncogenes that
create a kinase with abnormal activity that leads to phosphorylation levels not encountered in
any normal context).
7) “Could the supposed selective pressures that act in different phases – healthy organ,
carcinogenesis, metastasis – really be selecting for the same features” - The phrasing is fairly
sloppy here - none of the listed entities I hope that authors mean selective pressures acting at
different stages of cancer development here, as otherwise it will not make sense - but even then I
16
do not see how this would contradict SE framework.
7) “ leads to the idea that tissue level autonomous mechanisms dominate, and are mediated by,
cell-cell interactions rather than by gene-gene relationships.” - counterposition of cell-cell
communication and gene-gene communication represents a false dichotomy, as it refers to
different levels of organization. Changes in gene interactions are responsible for changes in cell-
cell interactions.
8) "In any case, the malignant phenotype is not a complete cellular reinvention, but rather one of
the states potentially existing in the cell”. - absolutely agree - but how does it conflict SE
framework?
9) "Somatic evolution is therefore seen as a co-evolution between cells and their
microenvironment” - even though this statement is in line with fairly common misconception,
give authors background, they should have been able to the semantical trap. Somatic evolution
refers to heritable changes in populations of cancer cells - evolution of microenvironment is a
different category - environment does change
10) "In addition, due to the irreversible nature of genetic mutation, it is also difficult to explain
how certain metastases remain dormant and can form links with the normal surrounding tissues”
- no it is not. Phenotype is not strictly linked with genotype, instead a give genotype enables a
wider range of phenotypic manifestations - think of diversity of cells in our body that have the
same genotypes. However, genetic mutations can influence the range of phenotypes available to
a cell.
11) "According to this model, tissues and organs are embedded in an extracellular matrix
(ECM)/basement membrane (BM) that provide them structural support and contextual
information along with soluble factors”. What is stated is a biological fact, taught in histology 101
- rather than a theory of a specific model.
12) “Now it is clear, from new epistemological assumptions and from empirical evidence, that the
solid tumor microenvironment/architecture may in fact significantly contribute to the emergence
of therapeutic resistance” - the statement is correct, but how does it conflict with SE framework?
Microenvironment and tissue architecture shape selective pressures experienced by tumor cells,
much like ecological variables influence selection in natural populations.
General comments:
1) It will be useful to have a more clear logical structure for the paper - the chain of
thought/argument is somewhat loose.
2) It would have been useful to add a glossary of definitions of terms, such as attractor landscape
and similar terms that do not have a universally accepted, unambiguous definition.
There are some sentences whose meaning escapes me.
1) “Several specifications should be made for a complete exposition of cancer research under a
Somatic Evolution framework” - what does it mean? Having next sentence starting with “for
example” makes it even more confusing.
2) "However, during the stochastic evolution of cancer it has proved impossible to establish a
direct causal relationship between environmental and specific genetic/epigenetic factors" - not
sure what authors mean here - worth elaborating.
Minor comments:
17
"At the level of the organism, cancer is usually lethal, so that it is plausible that a number of genes
and tissue organization mechanisms that suppress cancer might have been developed (18,19)” -
plausible seems to be a gross understatement.
“..and then very complex biological systems (such as ourselves!), which are composed of millions
of cells” - authors are off by 2 orders of magnitude, human body have trillions of cells.

label_comment_3
The revision successfully addressed the criticisms, resulting in a much more balanced and easier
to follow presentation that will be of benefit to the academic community. I am sorry that some of
my previous comments came across as overly harsh - many of the assertions that authors made in
the initial version sparked vehement disagreement in terms of both factual and conceptual
content.
I still disagree with some of the claims made by the authors, but since most of my residual
disagreement are probably open for debate, I have no objections against the publication of the
revised version of the manuscript. The following comments are meant to clarify some of my
previous points, and authors are welcome to include or reject the suggestions at their discretion.
18
1. To clarify my position, I think that the main source of the confusion in the field, spilling to the
manuscript, is the idea that a step-wise accumulation of “driver” mutations is equatable with a
Darwinian process. There are two problems with this notion. First, the simplistic view of step-
wise accumulation of mutations is inaccurate. It was originally meant to be a useful simplification
- and was labeled as such in a highly influential textbook by Robert Weinberg. At this point, I
would say it has outlived it’s utility as (re)discovery of intra-tumor heterogeneity points out to a
much more complex process - more similar to evolution in natural population that suggested by
that simplification. A second problem, more germane to my gripes with the manuscript, is that
this simplistic step-wise process was mistakenly referred to as Darwinian, and this mis-label
stuck, persisting through the literature. The idea that evolution is driven by the occurrence of
mutations that lead to dramatic phenotypic changes is clearly not Darwinian. In fact, it was a
subject of contention and debate between some of the geneticists and selection-centered
Darwinian naturalists, until the conflict was resolved with Modern Synthesis. Somehow, within
Cancer Biology, genetic-centered ideas that were considered explicitly in conflict with Darwinian
thinking, got the label of Darwinian, where considerations of selection and gradualism were left
out of the picture. I believe that conventional Darwinian framework (selection acting on heritable
diversification) is much more appropriate for the understanding of somatic evolution. Yet, it also
has its own limitations (as discussed in Chapter 18 of
https://www.elsevier.com/books/ecology-and-evolution-of-cancer/ujvari/978-0-12-804310-3,
file attached), and I think that authors are justified in pointing out to these issues. Throughout the
manuscript, however, authors challenge what appears to be a conflated framework, rising
objections against both “bastardized” genetic-centric and genuinely Darwinian frameworks. I
disagree with the conflation of the two frameworks, fist of which is clearly wrong (in its most
common, simplistic version), while the second one (in post-Synthesis interpretation) does have
legitimate limitations when applied to evolution in the soma.
2. Given the confusion stemming from semantic reasons, I think It might be useful adding a
glossary for some of the key terms, such as fitness, adaptation (if permitted by the journal).
3. I strongly disagree with the notion that tumor initiating mutations result in evolutionary cul-
de-sac and that they cannot be amplified by natural selection. This claim runs contrary to what is
commonly assumed to be the case in the cancer research community (once a relevant mutation
occurs in permissive lineage, clonal expansion inevitably follows). Whereas this commonly held
assumption is probably incorrect, as articulated in http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/onc.2012.281, the
truth is somewhere in between. I think it is impossible to ignore a mounting evidence for
positive selection of oncogenic mutations in normal tissues (for example -
10.1126/science.aaa6806)?
4. In the same vein, i disagree with the “..difficulty and arbitrariness of identifying proto-tumoral
features in the precancerous cells”. A straightforward counter-argument can be made, for
example, with the notion that reduced capability to undergo programmed cell death is favored
in context of certain environmental insults. UV exposure and ionizing irradiation have been
unequivocally linked with expansion of clones with TP53 mutation - one of the most common
and most understood of oncogenic mutations. Therefore, I would say there is ample experimental
and epidemiological evidence for (perhaps context dependent) positive selection for certain pre-
tumoral features.
5. I still do not understand the dichotomy between fitness and “real adaptation". Perhaps,
inclusion of a glossary would help clarifying this. Authors refer to evolutionary models in cancer
that uncouple these to terms. However, I am not aware of such arguments, so at the very leas I
would suggest supporting this assertion with some references, and perhaps elaborating on the
subject.
6. Authors use a statement that “cancer cell adaptations usually consist in immediate possibilities
offered by their molecular architecture”, as an argument against applicability of Darwinian
concepts toward SE. This is confusing to me. On one hand, this claim would pose a reasonable
challenge to a saltation, genetic-centric view on cancer evolution as a sequence of complex
adaptations. On the other hand, I do not see how it would contradict classical or post-synthesis
Darwinian framework. Darwinian selection on natural populations operate on the variations
within the existing molecular architecture.
19
7. Arguing against adaptations based on the intrinsic fitness does not make sense to me. The
original work of Godfrey-Smith presents a nuanced argument involving H-S-C space. I do not
see how one can single out S (intrinsic fitness) and shoot down importance of adaptation in
somatic evolution based on that. It seems to me no more justifiable than making exactly the same
argument against adaptations in the evolving natural populations. Given that the authors argue
that this is the main reason cancers cannot be considered as Darwinian systems, I would like to
see a more robust justification.
8. “The stochastic evolution of cancer makes it very hard to establish direct casual relationship
with specific genetic and epigenetic features” - I would say that one can make exactly same
statement in relation to the evolving natural populations - but I do not see a contradiction with a
Darwinian framework here . Perhaps, it can be an argument against a step-wise mutation-centric
view. However, this assertion is not really defensible for cancer evolution either, due to the sheer
amount of mechanism-centered evidence. For example, BRCA1 mutation status is strongly linked
with risk of developing cancers, and the underlying mechanisms are relatively well elucidated.
The same is true for the large numbers of well studied genetic mutations and epigenetic changes
(such as methylation of p16 locus). The argument based on incomplete penetrance of metastatic
lesions does not appear to be valid to me either. There are ample cases of incomplete penetrance
in natural populations. On top of that, the link between a genotype and phenotype is not a linear
function, instead involving a norm of reaction (which is arguably much wider in somatic cells, as
the genome has to encode a wide range of phenotypic manifestations), so context dependence of
the consequences of particular genetic/epigenetic changes is to be expected. Thus, I would
suggest to reconsider or re-phrase this argument.
9. It is unclear why authors choose to refer specifically to Novak in “As Novak suggested, the
Darwinian paradigm may become a unifying theory for several biological phenomena”. I would
say that Darwinian paradigm is one of the keystones of the modern biology - as aptly reflected in
a widely cited phrase by Theodor Dobzhansky, taken from the title of his assay “Nothing in
Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution". Perhaps, authors meant to refer
specifically to cancer? In this case, it should be explicitly stated.
10. I wish authors were right in “evolutionary thinking is fundamental in cancer research”.
Unfortunately, this is not the case, see the analysis in
(http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026100). I would not equate
step-wise progression model with evolutionary thinking, as it explains evolution away instead of
taking it into consideration.
11. To conclude, I think authors are (mostly) justified in highlighting the complexities
surrounding considerations of somatic evolution. However, these complexities call for
integration, instead of forcing the choice between one of the incomplete frameworks. Perhaps
authors could address this in their future work.

that simplification. A second problem, more germane to my gripes with the manuscript, is that
this simplistic step-wise process was mistakenly referred to as Darwinian, and this mis-label
stuck, persisting through the literature. The idea that evolution is driven by the occurrence of
mutations that lead to dramatic phenotypic changes is clearly not Darwinian. In fact, it was a
subject of contention and debate between some of the geneticists and selection-centered
Darwinian naturalists, until the conflict was resolved with Modern Synthesis. Somehow, within
Cancer Biology, genetic-centered ideas that were considered explicitly in conflict with Darwinian
thinking, got the label of Darwinian, where considerations of selection and gradualism were left
out of the picture. I believe that conventional Darwinian framework (selection acting on heritable
diversification) is much more appropriate for the understanding of somatic evolution. Yet, it also
has its own limitations (as discussed in Chapter 18 of
https://www.elsevier.com/books/ecology-and-evolution-of-cancer/ujvari/978-0-12-804310-3,
file attached), and I think that authors are justified in pointing out to these issues. Throughout the
manuscript, however, authors challenge what appears to be a conflated framework, rising
objections against both “bastardized” genetic-centric and genuinely Darwinian frameworks. I
disagree with the conflation of the two frameworks, fist of which is clearly wrong (in its most
common, simplistic version), while the second one (in post-Synthesis interpretation) does have
legitimate limitations when applied to evolution in the soma.
2. Given the confusion stemming from semantic reasons, I think It might be useful adding a
glossary for some of the key terms, such as fitness, adaptation (if permitted by the journal).
3. I strongly disagree with the notion that tumor initiating mutations result in evolutionary cul-
de-sac and that they cannot be amplified by natural selection. This claim runs contrary to what is
commonly assumed to be the case in the cancer research community (once a relevant mutation
occurs in permissive lineage, clonal expansion inevitably follows). Whereas this commonly held
assumption is probably incorrect, as articulated in http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/onc.2012.281, the
truth is somewhere in between. I think it is impossible to ignore a mounting evidence for positive
selection of oncogenic mutations in normal tissues (for example - 10.1126/science.aaa6806)?
4. In the same vein, i disagree with the “..difficulty and arbitrariness of identifying proto-tumoral
features in the precancerous cells”. A straightforward counter-argument can be made, for
example, with the notion that reduced capability to undergo programmed cell death is favored in
context of certain environmental insults. UV exposure and ionizing irradiation have been
23
unequivocally linked with expansion of clones with TP53 mutation - one of the most common
and most understood of oncogenic mutations. Therefore, I would say there is ample experimental
and epidemiological evidence for (perhaps context dependent) positive selection for certain pre-
tumoral features.
5. I still do not understand the dichotomy between fitness and “real adaptation". Perhaps,
inclusion of a glossary would help clarifying this. Authors refer to evolutionary models in cancer
that uncouple these to terms. However, I am not aware of such arguments, so at the very leas I
would suggest supporting this assertion with some references, and perhaps elaborating on the
subject.
6. Authors use a statement that “cancer cell adaptations usually consist in immediate possibilities
offered by their molecular architecture”, as an argument against applicability of Darwinian
concepts toward SE. This is confusing to me. On one hand, this claim would pose a reasonable
challenge to a saltation, genetic-centric view on cancer evolution as a sequence of complex
adaptations. On the other hand, I do not see how it would contradict classical or post-synthesis
Darwinian framework. Darwinian selection on natural populations operate on the variations
within the existing molecular architecture.
7. Arguing against adaptations based on the intrinsic fitness does not make sense to me. The
original work of Godfrey-Smith presents a nuanced argument involving H-S-C space. I do not see
how one can single out S (intrinsic fitness) and shoot down importance of adaptation in somatic
evolution based on that. It seems to me no more justifiable than making exactly the same
argument against adaptations in the evolving natural populations. Given that the authors argue
that this is the main reason cancers cannot be considered as Darwinian systems, I would like to
see a more robust justification.
8. “The stochastic evolution of cancer makes it very hard to establish direct casual relationship
with specific genetic and epigenetic features” - I would say that one can make exactly same
statement in relation to the evolving natural populations - but I do not see a contradiction with a
Darwinian framework here . Perhaps, it can be an argument against a step-wise mutation-centric
view. However, this assertion is not really defensible for cancer evolution either, due to the sheer
amount of mechanism-centered evidence. For example, BRCA1 mutation status is strongly linked
with risk of developing cancers, and the underlying mechanisms are relatively well elucidated.
The same is true for the large numbers of well studied genetic mutations and epigenetic changes
(such as methylation of p16 locus). The argument based on incomplete penetrance of metastatic
lesions does not appear to be valid to me either. There are ample cases of incomplete penetrance
in natural populations. On top of that, the link between a genotype and phenotype is not a linear
function, instead involving a norm of reaction (which is arguably much wider in somatic cells, as
the genome has to encode a wide range of phenotypic manifestations), so context dependence of
the consequences of particular genetic/epigenetic changes is to be expected. Thus, I would
suggest to reconsider or re-phrase this argument.
9. It is unclear why authors choose to refer specifically to Novak in “As Novak suggested, the
Darwinian paradigm may become a unifying theory for several biological phenomena”. I would
say that Darwinian paradigm is one of the keystones of the modern biology - as aptly reflected in
a widely cited phrase by Theodor Dobzhansky, taken from the title of his assay “Nothing in
Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution". Perhaps, authors meant to refer
specifically to cancer? In this case, it should be explicitly stated.
10. I wish authors were right in “evolutionary thinking is fundamental in cancer research”.
Unfortunately, this is not the case, see the analysis in
(http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026100). I would not equate
step-wise progression model with evolutionary thinking, as it explains evolution away instead of
taking it into consideration.
11. To conclude, I think authors are (mostly) justified in highlighting the complexities
surrounding considerations of somatic evolution. However, these complexities call for
integration, instead of forcing the choice between one of the incomplete frameworks. Perhaps
authors could address this in their future work.

RESPONSE TO REFEREES FOR:
Cancer and Inter-Cellular Cooperation

First of all, we want to thank the reviewers (R1 and R2 for brief) for their incredible job:
they have read our paper thoroughly and they have pointed out several real limits,
suggesting ways to solutions (even R2, who was particularly harsh at some points). We
thank R2 for suggesting excellent articles that we have read and included among the
references. In general, we have corrected factual mistakes; we have clarified arguments,
especially illusory dichotomies (e.g., TOFT vs. somatic evolution) and extreme
generalization (e.g. no mutations found for carcinogenesis, no sustained selective
pressures sustained through more than one cancer phases); and we have reorganized
some parts to improve the argument structure, as R2 requested.
In what follows we refer to pages and lines in the original submission. We recap what
were the main criticisms by the reviewers and we explain the many changes we have
made.
---
On p. 1, l. 26 (abstract), R2 had criticized our expression: “proto-tumoral and tumoral
features in precancerous cells that would undergo ‘natural selection’ have proven hard
to find”. We agree that “clearly demonstrated functional consequences of activating an
oncogene or inactivating of a tumor suppressor gene” are not hard to find. We changed
the phrase to argue, instead, that it is hard to demonstrate that these consequences
undergo natural selection. Hard, yet not impossible. The suggested paper Vermeulen et
al. 2013 is a very interesting experimental study of biased clone reproduction in mice
intestinal crypt, showing how differential reproduction may graft upon ongoing tissue-
maintenance dynamics. We particularly appreciated the importance of the context in
this reference, an aspect that will be touched upon several times throughout the paper.
About p. 1, l. 28 (abstract), R2 had asked: “Contemporary systems theories in cancer
research consider the notion of ‘field’ as an alternative source of cell cooperation -
alternative to what?” We have changed the word from “alternative” to “crucial”. In our
mind, alternative was meant to contrast ‘fields’ vs. evolutionary transitions as a source
of cooperation, but this conflation between proximate and ultimate causes (sensu Mayr)
was admittedly confusing.
After R2’s clarification request, we have rephrased p.2, l. 1 (sec. 2) to disclose what we
originally meant, i.e., that empirical and theorerical advances have brought the somatic
evolution model to a greater level of complexity and refinement.
On p.2, l. 4 (sec. 2), R2 had asked what do GRNs have to do with somatic evolution. We
have now developed a more gradual argument, focusing on the relevance of GRN for
mutations fate. We have added a link to evolution at the beginning of 2.1.
We reformulated section 2.1, 1st sentence, to avoid making a claim for high epistasis: as
R1 points out, the effects of mutations may indeed be additive, due to modularity (in
turn supported by evolutionary considerations) and low epistasis. Parenthetically, we
trust R1 about the measured amounts of epistasis in eQTL, but we would be interested
in having some references on this issue. In any case it is difficult to generalize.
Both referees agreed that on p. 2, ll. 18-20 (sec. 2.1) we had overstated the difficulty for
complex genes regulatory networks to evolve out of their current attractor landscape.
We changed the paragraph to emphasize the non-linearity of effects of mutations and,
more generally, the various outcomes that can be expected in a non-linear system,
including phase transition / facilitated evolution.
The reviewers said that on p.2, l. 22-23 (sec. 2.1) we had stressed too much the non-
genetic origin of cancer, not a straightforward implication of what we have presented.
They were right (at least for what concerns this specific point of the argument). Now we
have focused on other implications, mentioning that the way is opened to non-genetic
triggers of carcinogenic modifications.
On p.2, l. 39 (sec. 2.1) both reviewers had found an incorrect use of the “clonal
interference” concept. The important thing for us was to refer, more generally, to the
interactions between mutation rates and clonal expansions. We have changed the
passage accordingly.
On p.2, ll.52-53 (sec. 2.2) we have welcomed R1’s proposal of using the cell-autonomous
vs. non-cell-autonomous distinction. We agree that it can be philosophically problematic,
but this paper is more scientific than philosophical. Moreover, thanks to R1’s indication
we have found recent scientific discussions on the distinction that are also
philosophically interesting. From these discussions we have added a reference.
R1 pointed out that the “conceptual shift from a view of the cancer cell achieving a
number of functions to a view of the cell that loses the capability to cooperate
effectively” was misplaced in the original paper: p.3, ll. 8-9 (sec. 2.2). The particular
examples that we had chosen, according to R1, made the statement “less convincing
than it actually is”. To fix this problem, we have moved the “loss of function” issue from
the end of Section 5 to a point right before the Conclusion. The movement was reflected
in the section titles too, and we think this gives more emphasis and force to the point.
On p.3, l. 13 (sec. 2.2) we have changed the phrase to affirm – under R2’s suggestion,
indeed using some of R2’s own words – that cancer suppression mechanisms were an
absolute necessity in the evolution of metazoans.
As R1 noted, Peto’s paradox (p.4 Section 3, 2nd paragraph) could not be treated with the
due attention and depth in this paper. In this new version we thus preferred to move the
paradox to a footnote at the end of Section 2. The still relevant role of inclusive fitness in
explaining the defense mechanisms of post-reproductive individuals has been moved to
the end of 3.2.
On top of p.6 (sec. 4.1), both referees saw a serios problem with our “complex
adaptations” concept. We have now clarified that by “complex adaptations” we mean the
multi-generational emergence of complex traits as a result of a cumulative selection.
Cancer cells do show complex traits. Yet, cancer cells “adaptations” usually consist in
immediate possibilities offered by their molecular architecture, more than a series of
cumulative progressive modifications. In footnote 11 we took the liberty of using R2’s
excellent phrasing – undermining, in our interpretation, the cumulativity that
characterizes complex adaptations: “Wiring of healthy cells underlies phenotypes of
healthy cells, mutational and heritable epimutational changes either unlock some
phenotypic features that are not accessible to normal somatic cells of a given tissue
(such as those related to embryonic development) or create novel wiring, which is not
encountered in normal cells (such as mutations in RAS, or many of the fusion oncogenes
that create a kinase with abnormal activity that leads to phosphorylation levels not
encountered in any normal context).”
At the beginning of 4.2, R2 lamented our supposed “lack of understanding of the very
basic foundations of Darwinian evolution”, pointing out that fitness is a constitutively
relative measure, and stressing therefore that the relativity of fitness cannot be brought
against natural selection taking place. Of course fitness is always relative to a given
environment. However, Peter Godfrey-Smith pointed out that in a paradigmatic
Darwinian population the fitness of any individual is also intrinsic, i.e. it depends more
on intrinsic traits than on contingent external factors. On the contrary, how much a
cancer cell replicates depends strongly on extrinsic factors such as position, dimension,
nutrients and so on. We have rewritten the passage to make clear that we were referring
to the dependence of fitness on extrinsic traits (which makes the population not
paradigmatically Darwinian), rather than to the fully neo-Darwinian context relative
nature of fitness. The references provided by R2 for this point (Schaefer & Serrano 2016,
Sieber & Tomlinson 2005, Scott & Marusyk 2017) were extremely interesting. We read
the papers and used all of them in 4.3.
On p. 6 ll. 21-24 (sec. 4.2), R2 pointed out that constraining somatic evolution by
organismal level selection is widely accepted within cancer research community, and
that this does not conflict with cancer developing as a result of clonal evolution. True.
We have toned down the reference to multi-level selection in this part of the paper. We
are pretty in line with Germain and Laplane who consider that tumour level selection
does not have an important explanatory role for understanding the somatic evolution of
human cancer. Even if cancer progression has some resemblances with MLS2 and even if
it seems to act as a Major Transition, this does not give a big contribution to its
understanding as a pathological phenomenon.
On p.6 ll. 33-34 (sec. 4.2) we had stressed difficulty in finding inter-cellular selective
pressures that can be constant all the way through different cancer phases. We agree
with the referees that this problem is a minor one; the problem is also completely
subsumed by the problem whether complex adaptations are usually developed in inter-
cellular natural selection. For this reason, we have shortened this subsection and moved
it at the beniginning of section 4 (<U+F0E0> now sect. 4.1).
We didn’t agree with R2 that “Fitness is essentially a metric of adaptation” and that the
two cannot be uncoupled (p. 6 ll. 36-37). Adaptation has many meanings (e.g., a novel
structure or behavior, i.e. the cumulative results of fitness differences, as opposed to
fitness itself), and fitness is a complex concept and ensemble of measurements, hence
the two cannot be considered as synonyms. Still, the phrase has been clarified and
complemented with explanations in the other subsetions of section 4.
At the end of 4.2, R2 criticized our insistence on the theoretical statement that “only
where the karyotype is relatively stable (e.g., in development), can genetic mutations
and epigenetic adjustments play a dominant and determinant role”. R2 pointed out that
cancer genomes are certainly less stable that those of the normal tissues, but they are
not completely unstable either. Experimentally – R2 noted – one can introduce
mutations and up/down-regulation of gene expression (modeling epigenetic changes)
with strong, reproducible and measurable consequences. Also, most established cancer
cell lines maintain their karyotpye for numbers of generations, that would be sufficient
to generate number of cells far exceeding those found in the advanced decease, even
when starting from a single cells. As a response, we have toned down our statements in
both points as stability can of course be recognized in cancer too, and “stable” is always
a relative term. However, we cannot refrain from pointing out that the “reproducible
and measurable consequences” of experimentally induced mutations are, indeed, the
result of very narrow controlled conditions, and that in vivo tumours are extremely
unstable situations from the genetic point of view.
On p.7, first paragraph (sec. 4.3) R2 reproached us for attacking a straw-man. “The
widespread use of cell lines for cancer research is not because experimentalists are too
dim to understand that these models do not necessarily recapitulate situation in vivo”.
Yes, we agree, and there was no accusing “naïve scientists” in our words, nor an
idealized view of “realistic” or “right” scientific models. We have rephrased the passage
to emphasize our full acceptance of the technological context of the time, as well as of its
power as a source of knowledge. This change relates to R1’s observation – and related
changes – below about the term “revolutionized” (Section 5, 2nd paragraph).
About p. 7 ll. 37-38 (sec. 4.3), R2 claimed that we wrongly distinguished between “cell-
cell interactions” and “gene-gene relationships”. For R2, the fact that “Changes in gene
interactions are responsible for changes in cell-cell interactions” implies that the
“counterposition of cell-cell communication and gene-gene communication represents a
false dichotomy, as it refers to different levels of organization”. We don’t agree on this
point. It is true that “Changes in gene interactions are responsible for changes in cell-cell
interactions”, but the contrary is hardly true. The dichotomy holds thanks to causal
asymmetry: while changes in gene interactions affect cell-cell interactions (albeit in a
buffered and non-linear way), the opposite does not hold, as cell-cell communication
and gene expression are embedded in a larger context that regulates the properties and
behavior of the cell, without necessarily affecting particular gene sequences, molecular
mechanisms or biochemical pathways. We have modified the text to clarify this point.
On p. 7 ll. 44-45 (sec. 4.2), R2 asked why the fact that “the malignant phenotype is not a
complete cellular reinvention” should conflict with the Somatic Evolution framework.
We have moved this statement to 2.1, to better explain the theoretical changes brought
about by systems biology and gene regulatory networks. In this new location the
statement seems much more useful.
On p.8, 1st line (sec. 4.3) the sentence “Somatic evolution is therefore seen as a co-
evolution between cells and their microenvironment” was considered a misconception
by R2. We agree that the formulation was misleading. We corrected accordingly.
We removed the last sentence of section 4, "If carcinogenesis is the explanandum, any
reference to inter-cellular somatic natural selection seems to be little more than an ad
hoc addition to an explanatory theory unable to properly define functions, nor to
distinguish them from dysfunctions." The sentence was considered apparently bold but
obscure by R1. It was obscure, but probably also an excessive claim, and the paper now
conveys a more nuanced and complex view.
We rephrased, as R1 recommended, the 1st sentence of Section 5: "As we have seen,
believing that somatic evolution drives the multi-step process that produces a
metastatic cancer encounters more than one difficulty." R1 had pointed out that the
meaning of "driving" an evolutionary is problematic and unclear.
Immediately after, R2 had noticed that it is not difficult to explain how certain
metastases remain dormant and can form links with the normal surrounding tissues. We
acknowledged that dormancy was not the best candidate as a phenomenon calling for
non-genetic explanation. We thus replaced it with the observation that certain
metastases go back to normal phenotype, especially if inserted in normal surrounding
tissues.
On p. 8, ll. 16-17 (sec. 5) R2 didn’t like our use of the word “model” for a state-of-the art
notion, i.e., that tissues and organs are embedded in an extracellular matrix
(ECM)/basement membrane (BM) that provide them structural support and contextual
information along with soluble factors. We modified accordingly.
On Section 5, 2nd paragraph, R1 pointed out that views of the cell as embedded in a
larger system are not a revolution; rather, they are more successful today because of
technical advances and of having “already reaped the low-hanging fruits of the cell-
autonomous components of cancer”. We agree, and we have changed accordingly. This
observation and modification relates to the one above (p.7, 1st paragraph), about the
need for ideas to wait for technical advances in bio-medical research.
On p. 8, ll. 22-23 (sec. 5) we took some of R2’s words to complement our statement that
“from new epistemological assumptions and from empirical evidence [it is clear] that
the solid tumor microenvironment/architecture may in fact significantly contribute to
the emergence of therapeutic resistance”. The statement – accepted by R2 – as such does
not conflict with the Somatic Evolution framework.
We definitely agreed (see Bertolaso 2016) with an issue raised by R1 on p.5, and we
have added an explicit paragraph on that. The issue is that perpetuating a false
dichotomy between TOFT and somatic evolution is counter-productive. As R1
magisterially writes, “TOFT would represent a more global explanatory framework that
would include and encompass, rather than deny, the (admittedly local and non-
sufficient) explanatory power of genetics-centered views”.
A criticism by R1 on the conclusion was particularly useful: “You have built a convincing
case against the power of somatic evolution to explain cancer initiation, but you jump
rather too quickly to restricting it to metastasis. There are countless cases in which
cancer growth and progression seem in line with a somatic selection model, whereas I
agree that initiation is quite problematic. I would therefore suggest to nuance a bit in
this direction.” We agreed and we have changed accordingly.
Finally, R1 disagreed with the closing sentence of the original paper. The sentence
imagined to “go back to evolutionary theory and look for models that assume
prosociality, several kinds of altruism, unselfish behaviours etc. as natural states that
shift the explanatory efforts”. R1 pointed out that “[for cells] assuming a proliferative
state seems particularly fruitful because growth is a characterizing feature of all cells,
including those we descend from. However, in the case of evolutionary transitions, so-
called prosociality is always evolutionary second.” For R1 there was, in sum, a false
simmetry in our final argument. We have removed the final statement, which was only a
suggestion. The preceding statement is even more effective for closing the paper. In fact,
the “outlook” arguments we could have made were about how individual traits co-
emerge together with more inclusive contexts and wholes, how processes of natural
selection need suitable conditions of validity, and how they operate in definite contexts
and perhaps phases. Yet, for reasons of space, strength of argument, and relevance, we
chose to leave these reflections to another venue.
MINOR CORRECTIONS
<U+F0B7> Title 2.2: "exploitance" was a typo – changed to “exploitation”.
<U+F0B7> p.4, Section 3.1, second sentence missed a "The".
<U+F0B7> p.5, first line: "Lecel" was “Level”
<U+F0B7> p.5 l. 19 (sec. 3.3), “che” was “be”
<U+F0B7> p.6 ll. 45-47 (sec. 4.2) as R1 suggested, we changed "impossible" to merely
"difficult" in the following sentence: "However, during the stochastic evolution of
cancer it has proved impossible to establish a direct causal relationship between
environmental and specific genetic/epigenetic factors." (p.6)
<U+F0B7> page 7, 2nd paragraph: "tat" was “that”

Cancer and Inter-Cellular Cooperation
Marta Bertolaso and Anna Maria Dieli
Response to the second round of revisions
We thank once again Reviewer 2 (R2) for the insightful comments. R2 is so motivated
and competent that we think it would be a great opportunity if we could collaborate and
progress on the issue of evolutionary models of cancer. For now, we have incorporated
most of the further suggestions, some of which were fully justified and easy to
implement.
To the extent that was possible by means of minor changes in the text, we also tried to
address the deeper concerns. We hope this will be appreciated and sufficient to place
the paper in the right perspective.
We attached a file showing all the changes that were made in this final revision. We hace
tried to address all the 11 points that were raised by R2:
1. R2 put forth the idea that we could be conflating a pseudo-Darwinian (gene-
centric) framework and a genuinely Darwinian one, and that we inherit this
conflation from the literature. We tend to agree, and we have added
specifications where possible, especially in the abstract, introduction and
conclusion. Still, our paper is a review, and we think it is normal that it reflects
common simplifications and conflations. Nonetheless, we share the mid-term
goal of enlightening what a really Darwinian approach would bring, if correctly
applied, to cancer research (see also point 10).
2. R2 asked for a glossary. Not sure that the journal allows for such an apparatus,
we have tried to reach the same goal by means of some integrations in the text,
especially with regards to the dichotomy between fitness and “real adaptation"
(see below, point 5).
3. According to R2, cells do not get trapped in evolutionary cul-de-sacs and there is
evidence for positive selection of oncogenic mutations in normal tissues. We
have followed the suggestion (p.2, sect. 2.1) and adopted a more instrumental
view, allowing for a combination of attractors and natural selection. We have
borrowed some words by the reviewer.
4. According to R2, there is ample experimental and epidemiological evidence for
(perhaps context dependent) positive selection for certain pre-tumoral features,
such as reduced capability to undergo programmed cell death is favored in
context of certain environmental insults. On p. 6 we have toned down our claim
about the “impossibility” of finding positively selected pre-tumoral features, and
we have also added some examples – along R2’s suggestions – and references in
the footnotes.
5. R2 claims that he/she is not able to understand the dichotomy between fitness
and “real adaptation". We have added footnote 12 and a reference (Lewens) to
better clarify the distinction.
6. R2 points out that Darwinian selection on natural populations operates on the
variations within the existing molecular architecture, so the fact that “cancer cell
adaptations usually consist in immediate possibilities offered by their molecular
architecture” does not prevent the applicability of Darwinian concepts. This is
related with the “real adaptation” concept: see above, point 5.
7. R2 reproaches us for extrapolating only one from Godfrey-Smith’s three
dimensions to evaluate whether normal tissue cells populations could be
considered as paradigmatic Darwinian populations. It was not our intention to
give exclusive attention to this dimension. However, we regard it as a good
example, and – following Godfrey-Smith – we think that a deficiency in one
dimension is sufficient to steer a population away from the paradigmatic
position in the space of possible populations. We have corrected the text to make
our thought more apparent, taking into account R2’s observation.
8. R2 pointed out the sheer amount of mechanism-centered evidence about
carcinogenesis. To take this evidence into consideration, using some notable
examples, also provided by the reviewer, we have mentioned some genetic or
epigenetic features that are indeed strongly and ubiquitously related with the
risk of developing cancer. The point about specificity and stability is deeper: in
living beings, strong correlations between genetic features and organizational
phenomena such as cancer are not to be interpreted as signs of context
independence of the involved mechanisms. Also R2’s observation that “the link
between a genotype and phenotype is not a linear function, instead involving a
norm of reaction” goes in this direction.
9. R2 wondered why we chose to refer specifically to Nowak in the conclusion. We
found Nowak’s paper as particularly interesing, but the reference here was not
justified by any specificity. We have removed it.
10. We were particularly stimulated by R2’s observation that evolutionary thinking
is not sufficiently considered in cancer research. Even more stimulating was the
idea that a distortion of the original Darwinian ideas would be at the origin of
this merely rhethorical use of evolution in cancer research.
11. R2 forcefully clamed that the complexity in cancer research calls for integration,
“instead of forcing the choice between one of the incomplete frameworks”. We
basically agree with this idea, out analytical effort was not meant to reinforce
fragmentation and opposition in cancer research, but rather to be a step towards
a better integration. We have changed some passages of the paper to reflect this
message.
