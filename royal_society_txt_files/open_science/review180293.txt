Kim etc. reported a multi-functional chemosensor 1 as silver and sulfide detector was synthesized
by the combination of octopamine and 4-dimethylamino cinnamaldehyde. Sensor 1 exhibited a
ratiometric fluorescence emission for Ag+ from blue to sky. The sensing mechanism of 1 with
silver ion was unraveled by 1H NMR titrations and theoretical calculations. Sensor 1 also
discerned sulfide by enhancing fluorescence intensity and changing color from yellow to
colorless in aqueous solution. The sensing properties of 1 toward S2- were investigated by using
ESI-mass analysis, Job plot and 1H NMR titrations. I would like to suggest its publication in the

In this manuscript the authors report that the sensing behaves of an octopamine-based
fluorescence sensor for Ag+ and S2- ions. It is an interesting paper because very few reporter
about the detection of both silver (I) and sulfide using a single chemosensor. The work was done
well and the article was well written. Thus, I recommend acceptance of the manuscript after
minor revision as follows.
1. How about the reversibility of the binding of Ag+ and S2- by 1?
2. Is it possible that the probe 1 can be detect Ag+ ions in the aqueous solution?

Dear, Dr. Laura Smith, Publishing Editor
Manuscript ID: RSOS-180293
Title: A multi-functional chemosensor for ratiometric fluorescent detection of silver(I)
ion and dual fluorescent and colorimetric detection of sulfide
We have made the following changes in response to the reviewers’ comments. We really
appreciate valuable comments of the reviewers.
Reviewer #1:
Question 1: In the introduction part, the authors add the following references. i.e.
i) Chromogenic and fluorogenic chemosensors for hydrogen sulfide: review of
detection mechanisms since the year 2009. J Li, C Yin, F Huo. RSC Advances.
2015, 5 (3), 2191-2206.
ii) “Turn-on” fluorescent probe for detection of H2S and its applications in
bioimaging. Q Zhao, J Kang, Y Wen, F Huo, Y Zhang, C Yin. Spectrochimica
Acta Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy. 2018, 189, 8-12.
iii) A novel ratiometric fluorescent H2S probe based on tandem nucleophilic
substitution/cyclization reaction and its bioimaging. J Kang, F Huo, C Yin. Dyes
and Pigments. 2017, 146, 287-292.
iv) A novel isophorone-based red-emitting fluorescent probe for selective detection
of sulfide anions in water for in vivo imaging. F Huo, Y Zhang, P Ning, X Meng,
C Yin. Journal of Materials Chemistry B, 2017, 5 (15), 2798-2803.
Answer: We cited the papers in the introduction part and references 18, 35, 36 and 37.
1
Question 2: 13C NMR spectra of 1-Ag+ should be provided.
Answer: Unfortunately, we could not obtain 13C NMR spectra of 1-Ag+ because of its
low solubility.
Question 3: Fe2+, Au3+, Pd2+ ions etc. should be included.
Answer: Fe2+ was already included in Fig. 1. Au3+ and Pd2+ showed no any selectivity
as shown in Fig. 1. In competition test, Au3+ and Pd2+ interfered about 30%, but there
was still no problem to recognize Ag+ (Fig. 3). We described these results in the third
paragraph of page 6 and the third paragraph of page 7.
Question 4: Selectivity of 1 should include SO32-, OH-, BO3-, SO42- etc.
Answer: Unfortunately, SO32- and BO3- were not commercially available in three weeks
for revision. Therefore, HSO3- was used instead of SO32-. HSO3-, OH-, and SO42-
showed no any selectivity in both fluorescence and UV-vis studies as shown in Fig. 6. In
competition test, they displayed no inhibition for naked-eye detection (Fig. 8). For
fluorescence recognition, SO42- and OH- displayed interferences of 63 and 64%, but
they still showed the discernible fluorescence emission (Fig. S13). We described these
results in the second paragraph of page 8 and the second paragraph of page 9.
Reviewer #2:
Question 1: How about the reversibility of the binding of Ag+ and S2- by 1?
Answer: As the reviewer 2 suggested, we checked the reversibility of the binding of
Ag+ and S2- by 1. However, no reversibility was observed.
Question 2: Is it possible that the probe 1 can be detect Ag+ ion in the aqueous solution?
Answer: Unfortunately, the detection of Ag+ ion by the probe 1 was not possible in the
aqueous solution.

I believe that we have, with these changes, addressed the reviewers’ comments.
Thank you.
