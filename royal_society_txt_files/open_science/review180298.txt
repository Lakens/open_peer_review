The authors build a bitcoin visualization as an adjacency matrix representation. They then exploit
their graph in three different ways:
- following an obervation by Lerner on using extranonces as a slow real-time clock for miners;
- working on the velocity of circulation of blocks;
- trying to distinghish DoS attacks on Bitcoins.
I found the article pleasant but hard to read. For instance, I am not familiar with Neo4j and its
language and the code on p. 6, l 48-54 (Fig. 2) is hard to undertand for me. More generally, I
suggest that the authors elaborate more on Sec. 3. as this is the core of their work. As another
example, the authors give a link to a navigable interactive version of their map and it would be
convenient (maybe, in a dedicated appendix) to have a rough guide on how to navigate through
this map).
In thie same vein, I have been frustrated in Sec. 3 to see that quite interesting topics have been
relegated to future works as they certainly would have had their place here. The same is true fo
Sec. 5 where the authors could be more conclusive about their findings.
At this point, there is already a clear contribution with this submission. My feeling is that the
article could be made much better with more deeper explanations of the discovered phenomenas.

Blockchain Analytics is quite an innovative and potentially useful technique both for research
and industrial purposes.
The core contribution of the paper lies in the high fidelity graph model which tackles the
complexity of observing distributed systems (such as BitCoin) and makes distributed ledgers
observable.
In my view the structure of the paper as it is at the moment obscures this core contribution. As a
suggestion for improvement perhaps the authors could consider (1) either to split the paper into
two (for instance a paper applying blockchain analytics in finance and economics and another
paper applying blockchain analytics in information systems) or (2) keep the structure as it is now
and then lighten up a bit the use cases or even remove one of the use cases so far presented.
In regards to option 1 (two paper option) in addition to the monetary supply disinflation and
velocity of circulation analysis perhaps the authors could include the use of blockchain analytics
to track gross domestic product in near real time (there are some scholars working on the
application of big data to track GDP).
The URL provided to access the dataset seems to be not working.

Editor comments to the author:
The article received two reviews that point out to the important, novelty, and timeliness of this
line of research in blockchain technology. They also like the general contributions and would like
to see the paper accepted. But both reviews also point out that the structure and presentation of
the paper should be improved, to make it easier to appreciate and more accessible to people who
may not be familiar with specific tools or programming languages.
I share this assessment entirely

Appendix A
Dear Alice
We thank the editors and reviewers for their helpful comments on our initial
submission which certainly reflected our internal pre-submission discussions of
the article. I have now submitted the minor revision requested in line with their
suggestions.
As discussed with Andrew pre-submission, our target readership is a broad
spectrum of different domain specific experts, and the purpose of the article is
to hold interest and novelty from multiple specific areas whilst serving as an
enlightening first attack on some problems in order to stimulate attention from
those varied domains into blockchain analytics in general.
The common thrust of the comments was to change the structure of the
article to make it more accessible to fewer domain specific experts, exposing its
core contributions with more clarity. Our revised submission’s structure is now
sympathetic to a more generalist readership. We gave much reconsideration to
the suggestion to split the paper in two (as we had prior to initial submission)
but in light of our objectives, we felt the sum of two papers would be less than
one whole and that such a restructuring would be beyond the scope of a minor
revision. Our revision is now easier to read, more accessible to non-experts and
makes its core contributions much more transparent, which hopefully makes it
more digestible as a whole.
There was a minor confliction in the reviews, requesting ”more deeper ex-
planations” versus to ”lighten up a bit”, which we chose to interpret against our
stated objective of the article in that it’s an initial hopping on point to highlight
multiple areas for more substantial research. The revised article is now a lighter
yet still thorough read and more fulfilling results will be resolved in the near
future.
On the specific recommended edits: We have removed the domain specific
programming languages as we agree they hold little interest to readers with
non-graph database expertise. We have included a guide on how to navigate the
interactive map at the point of use. We have changed the style to have shorter
clauses and fewer adjectives so that it is now hopefully more than pleasant and
less hard to read. Can you get Dryad to activate the URL for the dataset we
submitted?
Separately I have submitted to Manuscriptcentral an image for your con-
sideration as a cover image for your special blockchain technology collection
issue.
I trust this addresses all issues satisfactorily and we look forward to seeing
the article in hard copy.
