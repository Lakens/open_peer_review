Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors provided an updated manuscript to their working on exploring the impurity effects
on vanadium electrolytes as a means of providing information for use of less than pure resources
in VRFB applications. A systematic approach was applied by addiing controlled concentrations of
Fe(III) into the vanadium electrolyte solution where an interesting performance enhancement
occurred at low concentrations of Fe(III), followed by a degradation in performance with
increasing Fe(III) concentrations. The work is important in providing a framework for pathways
of decreasing the electrolyte cost in future technological developments by exploring the use of
rich vanadium liquid, which is an intermediate step during vanadium purification. While many
points were addressed in the revision, there still remains a few areas that could use additional
thought and can be easily addressed.
Comment 1: Thank you for providing background information in regards to the total iron content
found in rich vanadium liquid. It would be beneficial for the author to include the numerical
value in the introduction to give the reader and idea as to why certain concentrations were
chosen for the work. This would help with driving the justification for the work. If Deng Zhi-gan
is capable of achieving 0.6 g/L of iron then this provides context as to why this work is
important.
Experimental:
8
Comment 1: A flow rate of 10 sccm sounds very low for a VRFB and leads to large mass transport
limitations and access to capacity when reacting the redox species, especially with an active area
of 25 cm2. It would be beneficial for the authors to explore a case where flow rate does not dictate
mass transport limitations. Please see A. Tang et al. / Journal of Power Sources 248 (2014) 154-162
and J Appl Electrochem (2011) 41:1175–1182 for flow rate studies
Comment 2: Could the authors please indicate the type of flow field used in this work? e.g.
serpentine or flow-through
Results and Discussion:
Comment 1: In regards to the response to Comment 2 in the rebuttal. This would be nice to have
in the supporting information as it is relevant to the temperature stability of vanadium species.
Comment 2: The CV measurements were performed on 6 samples, as shown in Table 2, yet Table
3 only shows the extracted values for 2 samples. It would be beneficial to the reader to see the
clear trend of increasing diffusion coefficient with increasing iron content to the maximum,
followed by the decrease in diffusion coefficient with increasing Fe concentration above 0.02 M.
Comment 3: In regards to the response of Comment 9 in the experimental section of the rebuttal.
The CV’s went below 0.77 V, which is the redox potential of Fe(III)/Fe(II) so it makes sense that
some Fe(II) is present in solution. As long as the potential remains above 0.77 V then Fe(II)
formation should never occur, which a pol curve should show. It would be beneficial to see what
the pol curve shows as a function of iron concentration, which is performed with an applied
current while EIS is performed at OCV (i.e. no current condition).
Comment 4: It is unclear why the authors added XRD and SEM to the manuscript as this has little
to do with the electrochemical properties of the vanadium species in the presence of iron. This
reviewer suggests that this addition be removed or moved to supporting information as it
detracts from the primary goal of the work.

The paper written by Muqing Ding reports a systematic investigation of the Fe(III) effect to the
power density of all vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB). It is a quite innovative research
perspective in the VRFB fields. Although, the significance of Fe(III) impurity may not be super
important, it is still necessary to provide us a comprehensive understanding of VRFB. In my
opinion, this paper has presented some important and valuable findings, for example the
maximum acceptable Fe(III) concentration (0.0196 mol/L) will be a useful information for the
preparation of vanadium electrolytes. Some highly important and persuasive experiments have
also been carried out to support the authors’ conclusions. Overall, I rate this manuscript as
scientifically sound, and interesting for the audience of Royal Society Open Science. Some minor
revisions would add to the value of the manuscript for definitely supporting its acceptation.
(1) Please check and correct some typos in the manuscript, such as, “square toot” should be
“square root” in the line 45, page 11; and “Fe (III) have” should be “Fe(III) has”
(2) Actually, the redox reaction mechanisms of V(V)/V(IV) is one of the key problems of VRFB.
The authors have given a very brief discussion in section 3.5 (page 15). To be more informative
for the general audience, some related references are suggested to be cited, for example:
a) J. Mater. Chem. A, 2015, 3, 16913 (a very good review of reaction mechanisms in VRFB)
b) ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2018, 10, 20621 (a new study of V(V)/V(IV) redox reaction
mechanism)
3) One of the most important findings is the diffusivity of vanadium ions will be enhanced by
0.0196 mol/L Fe(III), while decreased when the concentration was over 0.0196 mol/L. It’s easy to
understand the decreasement, due to the diffusion resistance from larger radius of Fe(III) as
explained in your manuscript. However, what’s the reason for the increasement of vanadium
diffusive by lower concentration (0.0196 mol/L) of Fe(3+)? A brief explanation is suggested to be
added.

Appendix A
The authors report their findings on the performance implications of the positive
electrolyte used in vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB, electrolyte = V(IV) / V(V))
when mixing Fe(III) contaminates into the solution. A systematic approach was
applied by addiing controlled concentrations of Fe(III) into the vanadium electrolyte
solution where an interesting performance enhancement occurred at low
concentrations of Fe(III), followed by a degradation in performance with increasing
Fe(III) concentrations. The work is important in providing a framework for pathways
of decreasing the electrolyte cost in future technological developments by exploring
the use of rich vanadium liquid, which is an intermediate step during vanadium
purification. However, there are several points that need to be addressed.
Experimental:
1. What is the total concentration range of Fe (Fe(III) and Fe(II)) in rich
vanadium liquid? It would be expected that any Fe(II) would reduce to Fe(III)
during the first charge cycle of rich vanadium liquid.
2. In order for easier comparison to the V concentration, it would be better to
report the Fe(III) concentration in mol/L.
3. Why was CV used and not RDE?
4. What was the size of the counter electrode?
5. A 1 cm^2 graphite plate is very large for a CV electrode, was there a
justification for why an electrode this large was used? In CV measurements,
the counter electrode should be much larger than the working electrode in
ore to ensure the half-reaction occurs at the CE as to not limit the reaction
at the WE. In future work, the measurement may benefit from the use of a
Luggin capillary.
6. Was a background scan performed of just the electrolyte (i.e. no salt, just
sulfuric acid)?
7. How are the copper plates insulated from solution? Where flow fields used?
If so then what type?
8. What was the flow rate?
9. Was there any electrode or membrane pretreatment? Usually a
pretreatment is performed by boiling in water, hydrogen peroxide, and
sulfuric acid when Nafion is employed as a separator.
Results and Discussion:
1. Were these experiments repeated? What is the error on 18 hours? That is,
do you know that precipitation did not occur at 17 hours, or did you just
check it the following day?
2. Did you measure the V(V) concentration before the measurement, and if so,
what was it? What was the change? It is unclear if the “redox titration
method” mentioned earlier is related to this, and it is not stated what the
“redox titration method” is.
3. Why do you think iron helps at 40 C but not at 50 C?
4. Your solutions are very concentrated in vanadium. Typically, CVs are done at
millimolar concentrations to reduce Ohmic losses through the electrolyte.
Your CVs likely have large Ohmic losses, making extraction of kinetic and
diffusion parameters difficult.
5. Your CVs sweep negative of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox. What is the expected
current from Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox and what error does it cause on your
diffusion coefficient and kinetic measurements?
6. You even mention this side reaction on pg 10. Since flow batteries can be
operated to avoid the Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox range, I am doubtful that “the side
reaction of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) could have a bad influence on the performance
of VRFB” as you suggest.
7. The semicircle you’ve attributed to R_ct and the Warburg impedance all
look similar, so why should the Warburg impedance vary by 13 orders of
magnitude?
8. The small amounts of Fe that you are adding should not change the solution
resistance by a factor of 2. Please explain this result.
9. If Fe(III) competes with vanadium to adsorb on the surface of the electrode,
that effect could be visible in a polarization curve. Also, it should scale with
concentration, but your results indicate it doesn’t.
10. Your Coulombic efficiency is too low (~85%) to make meaningful inferences
regarding capacity fade, since all capacity measurements are within 10% of
each other. Where is the other 15% of your capacity going?
11. Additionally, the Coulombic efficiency for N117 should hover around 95%
for a VRFB (S. Kim et al. / Electrochemistry Communications 12 (2010)
1650–1653) at 50 mA/cm^2, there should not have been a 10% drop when
going to 40 mA/cm^2.
12. The efficiency plot should be replotted to improve the ease of
interpretation. It is very difficult to read in the current state.
13. How was each efficiency value calculated?
14. Why was 40 mA/cm^2 chosen as the current density of interest when a
large distribution of literature that performs measurements at a single
current density perform the measurements at 50 mA/cm^2? Measurements
at this current density would help tremendously when comparing to other
literature.
15. The color choice for plotting is very difficult to read. It would be helpful if
the figures could be made using a color blind palettes with bolder symbol
sizes.
16. Table 1: V(V) is known to be thermally unstable around 40-50 C, how was
this controlled?
17. Table 2: Why is peak different? How do you know that your concentrations
are accurate enough?
18. Table 3: Which peak did you use to calculate diffusion coefficient?
19. Table 4: Why does the Warburg impedance sweep through 13 orders of
magnitude?
Conclusions:
“CV measurements indicated that better reaction kinetics was achieved by adding
1.1 g/L Fe(III), resulting in improvement of V(IV) diffusion coefficient, and better
reversibility of electrode reaction compared to pristine electrolyte”
<U+F0B7> It is still not clear why the Fe(III) would improve the V(IV) diffusion
coefficient.
“The EIS tests showed that Fe(III) affects the charge transfer process and limits the
diffusion process”
<U+F0B7> The Fe(III) should worsen the V(IV) diffusion coefficient, why is this
inconsistent with the CVs?
“The electrolyte with different concentration (over 1.1 g/L) of Fe(III) exhibited a
higher electrolyte resistance and charge transfer resistance than the pristine one,
which indicated that the transfer of V(IV) species and electron was more difficult
after adding Fe(III)”
<U+F0B7> This is inconsistent with the CV measurement, why?
“The charge-discharge tests showed that the electrolyte with Fe(III) have little effect
on the efficiency of VRFB, but Fe(III) could result in side rxn and cap fade….”
<U+F0B7> None of your tests demonstrate capacity fade conclusively, and Fe(II)/Fe(III)
redox is an obvious side reaction in this system.
“Fe(III) can compete with V(x) for adsorption on electrode”
<U+F0B7> Do you expect vanadium / Fe processes to be inner sphere or outer sphere?
Appendix B
Dear reviewer,
Thank you very much for your advices. We are truly grateful to you for the
constructive comments regarding our manuscript entitled “Effect of Fe(III) on the
positive electrolyte for vanadium redox flow battery”.( RSOS-171881)
Those comments are all valuable for improving our paper, as well as the
important guiding significance to our researches. We have studied comments
carefully and have made revisions. The revised portions are all marked in red in
the revised manuscript. The main revisions and the responses are as follows.

that the Fe(III) impurity content over 0.0196 mol L-1 significantly impaired the
thermal stability of V(V) electrolyte”. (Page 15/Line 525)
19. Section 4: “The EIS tests showed that the Fe(III) affects the charge
transfer process and limits the diffusion process. The electrolyte with different
concentration (over 1.1 g/L) of Fe(III) exhibited a higher electrolyte resistance and
charge transfer resistance than the pristine one, which indicated that the transfer
of V(IV) species and electron was more difficult after adding Fe(III)” has been
revised as “The EIS tests showed that positive electrolyte exhibited a higher
electrolyte resistance and charge transfer resistance when the Fe(III) impurity
concentration over 0.0196 mol L-1”. (Page 16/Line 537)
Comment 2: The long term stability should be prolonged; 20 cycles is far
from enough.
Response: We thank a lot for reviewer’s useful comment. Taking into
account the results of the charge-discharge test, we reset the charge-discharge
test cycle number to 50. 30 mL 1.6M V(IV) in 2.8M H2SO4 served as negative
electrolyte and 30 mL 1.6M V(III) in 2.8M H2SO4 as positive electrolyte were
cyclically pumped into the corresponding half-cell, respectively, by two peristaltic
pumps with a flow rate of 10 mL min-1. Fig.10 shows the coulombic efficiency
(CE), voltage efficiency (VE) and the energy efficiency (EE) of VRFB with
different concentration of Fe(III) as a function of cycling number. It can be
observed that the CE, VE and EE of VRFB without Fe(III) could reach 89.10%,
80.77% and 71.92% which are little difference than VRFB with 0.0196 mol L-1
Fe(III) (89.35%, 81.07% and 72.40%) and VRFB with 0.0286 mol L-1 Fe(III)
(88.99%, 81.61% and 72.59%).

different concentration of Fe(III) at a current density of 40 mA cm-2.
Reviewer 2:
Experimental:
Comment 1: What is the total concentration range of Fe (Fe(III) and Fe(II))
in rich vanadium liquid? It would be expected that any Fe(II) would reduce to
Fe(III) during the first charge cycle of rich vanadium liquid.
Response: We appreciate the reviewer a lot for the constructive comment.
At present, in the industrial production of vanadium extraction, rich vanadium
liquid is mainly obtained by roasting process, acid leaching process and extraction
process. Deng Zhi-gan et al. extracted vanadium from stone-coal by oxygen pressure
acid leaching (the leaching solutions contain 4.65 g/L V and 6.31 g/L Fe) and solvent
extraction. By way of extraction, the concentration of vanadium could be raised to 37
g/L or more, and the concentration of iron could be reduced to 0.6 g/L. Li Xing-bin et
al. selected solvent extraction of vanadium from a stone coal/black shale acid leach
solution (containing 5.78 g/L V2O5 and 10.86 g/L total Fe) by D2EHPA/TBP, and the
rich vanadium liquid contains 26.3 g/L V2O5 and 0.72 g/L Fe. According to the
experimental results of the above scholars, we can see that the concentration of Fe
in rich vanadium liquid is more than 0.6 g/L. And the iron content in the rich
vanadium liquid will be different when employing different minerals and different
production engineering. In the industrial production process, when the
concentration of vanadium in rich vanadium liquid is further enriched, the
impurity ions in the solution will also be enriched, and the concentration of Fe will
be higher.
In addition, when the impurity ions in the electrolyte reach a certain
concentration limitation, the electrolyte will lose its activity and need to be regenerated.
However, the concentration limitation of iron ions in the electrolyte is not clear and
the law of the influence of the electrolyte performance is not clear. A further systematic
study was made to determine the concentration limitation of iron ions in the electrolyte,
thus providing theoretical guidance for the regeneration treatment of the electrolyte
during use process.

Comment 2: In order for easier comparison to the V concentration, it would
be better to report the Fe(III) concentration in mol/L.
Response: We thank a lot for reviewer’s useful comment. “A certain
concentration (0.5 g/L, 0.9 g/L, 1.1 g/L, 1.3 g/L, 1.6 g/L) of Fe(III)
(Fe2(SO4)3.xH2O) was added into the electrolytes” has been revised as “A certain
concentration (0.00893 mol L-1, 0.0161 mol L-1, 0.0196 mol L-1, 0.0232 mol L-1,
0.0286 mol L-1) of Fe(III) (Fe2(SO4)3.xH2O) was added into the electrolytes”.
Comment 3: Why was CV used and not RDE?
Response: We appreciate a lot for the reviewer’s constructive comment on
our manuscript. CV has been worldwide used [7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 24-26, 29] to
investigate the electrochemical behavior of vanadium electrolyte. Anodic peak,
Cathodic peak, Peak potential difference (<U+0394>Ep), Peak current ratio (Jpa/jpc) and
diffusion coefficient of V(IV) species could be clearly shown in the CV curves.

Comment 4: What was the size of the counter electrode?
Response: Thanks a lot for the reviewer’s useful suggestion. A platinum
sheet electrode was used for the counter electrode, and the size of the counter
electrode is 2 cm2.
Comment 5: A 1 cm^2 graphite plate is very large for a CV electrode, was
there a justification for why an electrode this large was used? In CV measurements,
the counter electrode should be much larger than the working electrode in ore to
ensure the half-reaction occurs at the CE as to not limit the reaction at the WE. In
future work, the measurement may benefit from the use of a Luggin capillary.
Response: We thank a lot for reviewer’s useful comment. In CV
measurements, the counter electrode should be much larger than the working
electrode in order to ensure the half-reaction occurs at the CE as to not limit the
reaction at the WE. In view of this, the curves of current versus potential were
recorded in a three-electrode electrochemical cell with a platinum sheet electrode
(2 cm2) as the counter electrode, an aqueous saturated calomel electrode (SCE)
along with a salt bridge full of saturated potassium chloride solution as reference
electrode and a graphite plate (1 cm2) as working electrode.
Comment 6: Was a background scan performed of just the electrolyte (i.e.
no salt, just sulfuric acid)?
Response: Thanks a lot for the reviewer’s useful suggestion. The
compositions of the pristine solution consists of 1.6 mol L-1 VOSO4 and 2.8 mol
L-1 H2SO4.
Comment 7: How are the copper plates insulated from solution? Where flow
fields used? If so then what type?
Response: We thank a lot for reviewer’s useful comment. The charge-
discharge tests were performed in a VRFB single dynamic cell, which was
assembled by employing two pieces of PAN-based graphite felt (25 cm2) as
electrode, Nafion 117 ion-exchange membrane as separator and two copper plates
as current collectors. 30 mL 1.6M V(IV) in 2.8M H2SO4 served as negative
electrolyte and 30 mL 1.6M V(III) in 2.8M H2SO4 as positive electrolyte were
cyclically pumped into the corresponding half-cell, respectively, by two peristaltic
pumps with a flow rate of 10 mL min-1. The galvanostatic charge-discharge test of
the single cell were carried out using CT2001B-5V/10A (Wuhan Land Co., China)
(as the figures shown below).
Fig. (A) Picture of the single VRFB cell and (B) a scheme of the cell
configuration
Comment 8: What was the flow rate?
Response: Thanks a lot for the reviewer’s useful suggestion. In the charge-
discharge tests, 30 mL 1.6M V(IV) in 2.8M H2SO4 served as negative electrolyte
and 30 mL 1.6M V(III) in 2.8M H2SO4 as positive electrolyte were cyclically
pumped into the corresponding half-cell, respectively, by two peristaltic pumps
with a flow rate of 10 mL min-1.
Comment 9: Was there any electrode or membrane pretreatment? Usually a
pretreatment is performed by boiling in water, hydrogen peroxide, and sulfuric
acid when Nafion is employed as a separator.
Response: We appreciate the reviewer a lot for the constructive comment.
Before experiment, the Nafion 117 ion-exchange membrane was soaked in 3%
hydrogen peroxide solution for 1 h, then soaked in 1 mol L-1 H2SO4 for 30 min at
80 °C and rinsed with deionized water. Each piece of graphite felt was soaked in
an ethanol water solution (70%) under ultrasonication for 30 min to remove
impurities in the fibers, then rinsed with deionized water and dried in an oven at
50 °C for 10 h.
Results and Discussion:
Comment 1: Were these experiments repeated? What is the error on 18 hours?
That is, do you know that precipitation did not occur at 17 hours, or did you just
check it the following day?
Response: We thank a lot for reviewer’s useful comment. These experiments
repeated three times. In the thermal stability experiment, the samples were
monitored regularly for the formation of precipitation and recorded the time when
a slight precipitation appeared. We checked the samples which stored in 40 °C
every six hours, and we checked the samples which stored in 50 °C every two
hours.
Comment 2: Did you measure the V(V) concentration before the
measurement, and if so, what was it? What was the change? It is unclear if the
“redox titration method” mentioned earlier is related to this, and it is not stated
what the “redox titration method” is.
Response: We appreciate the reviewer a lot for the constructive comment.
Before the measurement, the V(V) concentration of the test samples were 1.58
mol/L ~ 1.62 mol/L. The solutions were filtered at regular intervals and titrated to
determine the changes in vanadium concentration. The downtrend of vanadium
concentration for electrolyte was more quickly than the pristine one when the
Fe(III) addition was more than 0.0196 mol/L, as shown in Fig.1. The concentration
of V(V) ion decreased gradually with the prolonging of heating time, and the
concentration of remaining V(V) ions in electrolyte with 0.0232 mol/L Fe(III)
impurity was 0.1 mol/L lower than that of the pristine electrolyte between 10 and
22 hours.
The vanadium concentration in the electrolyte was analyzed by the
potentiometric redox titration method. The procedure of the redox titration method
is to add the sulfur and phosphorus mixed acid, then add potassium permanganate
solution to the electrolyte until the solution becomes purple, and finally, have a
titration using a potentiometric titrator with ferrous ammonium sulfate standard
solution until the potential of electrolyte changes suddenly; the vanadium
concentration can be calculated through the titration volume and concentration of
standard solution [21].

Figure 1: Effect of Fe(III) on thermal stability of V(V) electrolyte at the
temperature of 50 °C.
Comment 3: Why do you think iron helps at 40 °C but not at 50 °C?
Response: We appreciate a lot for the reviewer’s constructive comment on
our manuscript. The effect of Fe(III) on the time for the precipitation formation at
50 °C is not obvious, because the V(V) electrolyte could only exist stably in 50 °C for
18 h. But at 50 °C, the downtrend of vanadium concentration for electrolyte was
more quickly than the pristine one when the Fe(III) addition was more than 0.0196
mol/L, as shown in Fig.1. The concentration of V(V) ion decreased gradually with
the prolonging of heating time, and the concentration of remaining V(V) ions in
electrolyte with 0.0232 mol/L Fe(III) impurity was 0.1 mol/L lower than that of
the pristine electrolyte between 10 and 22 hours, indicating that the Fe(III)
impurity content over 0.0196 mol/L significantly impaired the thermal stability of
V(V) electrolyte.
Comment 4: Your solutions are very concentrated in vanadium. Typically,
CVs are done at millimolar concentrations to reduce Ohmic losses through the
electrolyte. Your CVs likely have large Ohmic losses, making extraction of kinetic
and diffusion parameters difficult.
Response: We thank a lot for reviewer’s useful comment. The CV test of the
electrolyte with different concentration of Fe(III) was carried out at a scan rate
range of 10-100 mV s-1 in the same voltage range. It presents the typical
characteristics of a quasi-reversible one-electron process for the anodic and
cathodic peak potentials change gradually with the scanning rates. Theoretically,
the value of diffusion coefficient for a quasi-reversible reaction (D) is between that
for a reversible (D1) one and for an irreversible (D2) one. For a reversible and
irreversible one-step and one-electron reaction, the peak current ip is given in Eq.
(2) and Eq. (3), respectively [23-26]:
For a reversible reaction:
ip <U+F03D> 2.69 <U+F0B4>105 n3/2 ACD1/2 1 v
1/2
(2)
For an irreversible reaction:
ip <U+F03D> 2.99 <U+F0B4>105 n3/2<U+F061>1/2 ACD1/2 2 v
1/2
(3)
where n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, A is the surface
area of working electrode (1 cm2), C is the bulk concentration of primary reactant,
D1 and D2 refer to the diffusion coefficient for a reversible reaction and an
irreversible reaction, respectively, <U+03C5> is the scanning rate.

Comment 5: Your CVs sweep negative of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox. What is
the expected current from Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox and what error does it cause on your
diffusion coefficient and kinetic measurements?
Response: Thanks a lot for the reviewer’s useful suggestion. In the CV tests,
the current of Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox was 0.002 A cm-2 ~ 0.005 A cm-2, and the current
was small because the concentration of Fe in electrolyte was extremely low. The
experiment results were clearly shown that the diffusion coefficient of V(IV)
species was increased from ( 2.06 - 3.33 )×10-6 cm2s-1 to ( 2.44 - 3.95 )×10-6 cm2s-
1
with 0.0196 mol L-1 Fe(III), while decreased from ( 2.06 - 3.33 )×10-6 cm2s-1 to
( 1.78 - 2.88 )×10-6 cm2s-1 with 0.0286 mol L-1 Fe(III), indicating an improvement
in the diffusion of V(IV) ions when the Fe(III) concentration was under 0.0196
mol L-1.
Comment 6: You even mention this side reaction on pg 10. Since flow
batteries can be operated to avoid the Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox range, I am doubtful that
“the side reaction of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) could have a bad influence on the
performance of VRFB” as you suggest.
Response: We thank a lot for reviewer’s useful comment. Iron impurity ions
not only produce side reaction, but also influence other properties of electrolyte.
When the Fe(III) impurity content over 0.0196 mol L-1, the thermal stability of
V(V) electrolyte was impaired, the diffusion coefficient of V(IV) species
decreased from ( 2.06 - 3.33 )×10-6 cm2s-1 to ( 1.78 - 2.88 )×10-6 cm2s-1, and the
positive electrolyte exhibited a higher electrolyte resistance and charge transfer
resistance. Furthermore, Fe(III) could result in the side reaction and capacity
fading, which maybe have a detrimental effect on battery application. With the
increase of Fe(III), the collision probability of vanadium ions with Fe(III) and the
competition of redox reaction were aggravation, which would interfere with the
electrode reaction, the diffusion of vanadium ions, and the performance of VRFB.
Comment 7: The semicircle you’ve attributed to Rct and the Warburg
impedance all look similar, so why should the Warburg impedance vary by 13
orders of magnitude?
Response: Thanks a lot for the reviewer’s useful suggestion. In the
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiment, Rct and W stands for the
charge transfer resistance and Warburg diffusion impedance in the electrochemical
process, respectively. Warburg impedance is related to liquid phase mass transfer
velocity. When the electrolyte with 0.0196 mol L-1 Fe(III), the diffusion coefficient
of V(IV) species was higher, so the Warburg impedance was lower; While the
electrolyte with 0.0286 mol L-1 Fe(III), the diffusion coefficient of V(IV) species
was lower, so the Warburg impedance was higher.
Comment 8: The small amounts of Fe that you are adding should not change
the solution resistance by a factor of 2. Please explain this result.
Response: We thank a lot for reviewer’s useful comment. As the experiment
results shown, the electrolyte with different concentration of Fe(III) exhibited a
higher solution resistance, interface resistance, electrolyte film resistance and the
charge transfer resistance than the pristine one, which indicated that the processes
of mass transfer and charge transfer was more difficult after adding Fe(III). With
the addition of iron impurity ions, the chemical compositions of the solution
changes, which leads to the change of the solution resistance. Furthermore, the
valence of Fe(III) is lower than that of vanadium ions, with the Fe(III) addition,
the electrode surface status changes slightly and Fe(III) is competitive with
vanadium ions for the adsorption on the electrode surface and redox reaction,
which results the charge imbalance on the electrode surface and alters the electric
double-layer at the interface.
Comment 9: If Fe(III) competes with vanadium to adsorb on the surface of
the electrode, that effect could be visible in a polarization curve. Also, it should
scale with concentration, but your results indicate it doesn’t.
Response: We appreciate the reviewer a lot for the constructive comment.
This manuscript do not include Tafel polarization curve study. As the
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiment results shown, the
electrolyte with different concentration of Fe(III) exhibited a higher solution
resistance, interface resistance, electrolyte film resistance and the charge transfer
resistance than the pristine one, which indicated that the processes of mass transfer
and charge transfer was more difficult after adding Fe(III). In addition, CV curves
was found a secondary oxidation and reduction peak at 0.4-0.6V. The peak
currents were found to increase with the increased of the concentration of Fe(III).
This is probably attributed to the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple reaction. Because addition
of the Fe(III) ions into the electrolyte, Fe(III) ions transferred to the electrode
surface to gain or lose electrons, forming a secondary peak at 0.4-0.7V [27]. The
changes of Fe(III) concentration in the CV tests clearly shown that the almost all
of Fe(III) had transformed to Fe(II) after the CV tests, which illustrated Fe(III) is
competitive with vanadium ions for the adsorption on the electrode surface and
redox reaction.

Comment 10: Your Coulombic efficiency is too low (~85%) to make
meaningful inferences regarding capacity fade, since all capacity measurements
are within 10% of each other. Where is the other 15% of your capacity going?
Response: We thank a lot for reviewer’s useful comment. In consideration
of this comment, we have retest the charge-discharge experiment. It can be
observed that the CE, VE and EE of VRFB without Fe(III) could reach 89.10%,
80.77% and 71.92% which are little difference than VRFB with 0.0196 mol L-1
Fe(III) (89.35%, 81.07% and 72.40%) and VRFB with 0.0286 mol L-1 Fe(III)
(88.99%, 81.61% and 72.59%). The Coulombic efficiency is about 90%, and the
results fit the opinion that all capacity measurements are within 10% of each other.
(as the figures shown below)
Figure 10: Efficiency of batteries employing positive electrolytes with
different concentration of Fe(III) at a current density of 40 mA cm-2.
Comment 11: Additionally, the Coulombic efficiency for N117 should hover
around 95% for a VRFB (S. Kim et al. / Electrochemistry Communications 12
(2010) 1650–1653) at 50 mA/cm^2, there should not have been a 10% drop when
going to 40 mA/cm^2.
Response: We appreciate the reviewer a lot for the constructive comment.
The efficiency of the battery is not only related to the ion exchange membrane,
but also with the temperature of the electrolyte, the flow velocity, the composition
of the electrolyte, the concentration of vanadium ion in the electrolyte, the
concentration of sulphuric acid in the electrolyte and the current density. J.X. Pan
et al. [10] researched the Coulombic efficiency of VRFB single cells operated at
0 °C and 20 °C and at various current densities (25 mA cm-2 - 75 mA cm-2), and
the Coulombic efficiency of VRFB was 84% - 93%. M.H. Jing et al. [12]
researched the effect of the concentration of the electrolyte on the electrochemical
performance of VRFB, and they found that different concentration of VOSO4 and
different concentration of H2SO4 will make a difference in battery efficiency, and
the Coulombic efficiency hover around 90% for a VRFB with 1.6 mol L-1 VOSO4
and 2.8 mol L-1 H2SO4 at 50 mA cm-2.

Comment 12: The efficiency plot should be replotted to improve the ease of
interpretation. It is very difficult to read in the current state.
Response: We thank a lot for reviewer’s useful comment. The efficiency plot
have been replotted to improve the ease of interpretation. It can be observed that
the CE, VE and EE of VRFB without Fe(III) could reach 89.10%, 80.77% and
71.92% which are little difference than VRFB with 0.0196 mol L-1 Fe(III) (89.35%,
81.07% and 72.40%) and VRFB with 0.0286 mol L-1 Fe(III) (88.99%, 81.61% and
72.59%).
Comment 13: How was each efficiency value calculated?
Response: Thanks a lot for the reviewer’s useful suggestion. CE= (Discharge
capacity/ Charge capacity)<U+2179>100%; VE= (Average voltage of Discharge voltage/
Average voltage of Charge voltage)<U+2179>100%; EE= (CE<U+2179>VE)<U+2179>100%.
Comment 14: Why was 40 mA/cm^2 chosen as the current density of
interest when a large distribution of literature that performs measurements at a
single current density perform the measurements at 50 mA/cm^2? Measurements
at this current density would help tremendously when comparing to other literature
Response: We appreciate a lot for the reviewer’s constructive comment on
our manuscript. There are a large distribution of literature that performs
measurements at a single current density perform the measurements at 40 mA cm-

Comment 16: Table 1: V(V) is known to be thermally unstable around 40-
50 C, how was this controlled?
Response: We thank a lot for reviewer’s useful comment. During the stability
tests, the electrolyte with different concentration of Fe(III) were statically stored
in a temperature-controlled bath at different temperatures (25 °C, 40 °C and 50 °C).
Previous research found that the V5+ species exist as hydrated penta co-ion, i.e.
[VO2(H2O)3]1+, this hydrated structure is not stable at elevated temperature and
change into neutral H3VO4 molecule via a deprotonation process and subsequently
leading to the observed V2O5 precipitation in V5+ electrolyte solutions [11].

Comment 17: Table 2: Why is peak different? How do you know that your
concentrations are accurate enough?
Response: We appreciate the reviewer a lot for the constructive comment.
To ensure that the concentrations are accurate enough, before the experimental,
the vanadium concentration in the electrolyte was analyzed by the potentiometric
redox titration method [21]; the total iron concentration in the electrolytes was
determined by ICP-AES; the ferrous iron concentration in the electrolytes was
measured using the 1,10-phenanthroline spectrophotometry [22]; the ferric iron
concentration in the electrolytes was calculated by mass balance; and all the
chemical reagents used in present experiments are analytically pure and the
solutions were prepared with de-ionized water.
The peak different was due to the electrochemical activity of V(V)/V(IV)
redox couple be changed by the addition of Fe(III).

Comment 18: Table 3: Which peak did you use to calculate diffusion
coefficient?
Response: We thank a lot for reviewer’s useful comment. In order to further
investigate the effect of Fe(III) on the kinetics of electrode reaction, a series of CV
curves for test electrolyte containing different concentration of Fe(III) on the
graphite electrode at various scan rates are shown in Fig.6. It presents the typical
characteristics of a quasi-reversible one-electron process for the anodic and
cathodic peak potentials change gradually with the scanning rates. A plot of redox
peak currents as a linear function of the square toot of scan rates with different
concentration of Fe(III) further verified the quasi-reversible process for
V(V)/V(IV) redox reaction are shown in Fig.7.
Theoretically, the value of diffusion coefficient for a quasi-reversible reaction
(D) is between that for a reversible (D1) one and for an irreversible (D2) one. For
a reversible and irreversible one-step and one-electron reaction, the peak current
ip is given in Eq. (2) and Eq. (3), respectively [23-26]:
For a reversible reaction:
ip <U+F03D> 2.69 <U+F0B4>105 n3/2 ACD1/2 1 v
1/2
(2)
For an irreversible reaction:
ip <U+F03D> 2.99 <U+F0B4>105 n3/2<U+F061>1/2 ACD1/2 2 v
1/2
(3)
where n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, A is the surface area
of working electrode (1 cm2), C is the bulk concentration of primary reactant, D1
and D2 refer to the diffusion coefficient for a reversible reaction and an irreversible
reaction, respectively, <U+03C5> is the scanning rate.
The corresponding diffusion coefficients of the electrolyte with different
concentration (0 mol L-1, 0.0196 mol L-1, 0.0286 mol L-1) of Fe(III) obtained from
Eq. (2) and Eq. (3).

Comment 19: Table 4: Why does the Warburg impedance sweep through 13
orders of magnitude?
Response: We appreciate a lot for the reviewer’s constructive comment on
our manuscript. In the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiment, W
stands for the Warburg diffusion impedance in the electrochemical process.
Warburg impedance is related to liquid phase mass transfer velocity. The diffusion
of reactants is hindered and concentration polarization is produced. When the
electrolyte with 0.0196 mol L-1 Fe(III), the diffusion coefficient of V(IV) species
was higher, so the Warburg impedance was lower; While the electrolyte with
0.0286 mol L-1 Fe(III), the diffusion coefficient of V(IV) species was lower, so the
Warburg impedance was higher.
Conclusions:
Comment : “CV measurements indicated that better reaction kinetics was
achieved by adding 1.1 g/L Fe(III), resulting in improvement of V(IV) diffusion
coefficient, and better reversibility of electrode reaction compared to pristine
electrolyte”
• It is still not clear why the Fe(III) would improve the V(IV) diffusion
coefficient.
Response: Thanks a lot for the reviewer’s useful suggestion. When the
electrolyte with under 0.0196 mol L-1 Fe(III), the electrochemical activity and the
diffusivity of vanadium ions were enhanced. However, the electrochemical
reaction and the vanadium ion diffusion became difficult due to the increased
electrolyte film resistance and interface resistance resulted from too large amounts
of Fe(III). The collision probability of vanadium ions with Fe(III) increases due to
the larger radius of Fe3+ (0.63 Å) compared to that of V4+ (0.46 Å), V5+ (0.355 Å).
Thus, the diffusion resistance of vanadium ions increased when the concentration
of Fe(III) was over 0.0196 mol L-1 in anolyte. Furthermore, the valence of Fe(III)
is lower than that of vanadium ions, with the Fe(III) addition, the electrode surface
status changes slightly and Fe(III) is competitive with vanadium ions for the
adsorption on the electrode surface and redox reaction, which results the charge
imbalance on the electrode surface and alters the electric double-layer at the
interface. Therefore, the electrolyte film resistance and the interface resistance
increased with the addition of Fe(III). The increase of the collision probability and
the competition charge-discharge can interfere with the electrode reaction, the
diffusion of vanadium ions, and the performance of VRFB.
Comment : “The EIS tests showed that Fe(III) affects the charge transfer
process and limits the diffusion process”
• The Fe(III) should worsen the V(IV) diffusion coefficient, why is this
inconsistent with the CVs?
Response: We thank a lot for reviewer’s useful comment. The EIS tests
showed that positive electrolyte exhibited a higher electrolyte resistance and
charge transfer resistance when the Fe(III) impurity concentration over 0.0196 mol
L-1. The CV measurements indicated that the diffusion coefficient of V(IV) species
was increased from ( 2.06 - 3.33 )×10-6 cm2s-1 to ( 2.44 - 3.95 )×10-6 cm2s-1 with
0.0196 mol L-1 Fe(III), while decreased from ( 2.06 - 3.33 )×10-6 cm2s-1 to ( 1.78 -
2.88 )×10-6 cm2s-1 with 0.0286 mol L-1 Fe(III). The results of CV measurements
are consistent with the EIS tests.
Comment :“The electrolyte with different concentration (over 1.1 g/L) of
Fe(III) exhibited a higher electrolyte resistance and charge transfer resistance than
the pristine one, which indicated that the transfer of V(IV) species and electron
was more difficult after adding Fe(III)”
• This is inconsistent with the CV measurement, why?
Response: We appreciate the reviewer a lot for the constructive comment.
The electrolyte with over 0.0196 mol L-1 Fe(III) exhibited a higher electrolyte
resistance and charge transfer resistance than the pristine one, which indicated that
the transfer of V(IV) species and electron was more difficult after adding too much
Fe(III). This is consistent with the CV measurement, because the diffusion
coefficient of V(IV) species was decreased from ( 2.06 - 3.33 )×10-6 cm2s-1 to
( 1.78 - 2.88 )×10-6 cm2s-1 with 0.0286 mol L-1 Fe(III).
Comment :“The charge-discharge tests showed that the electrolyte with
Fe(III) have little effect on the efficiency of VRFB, but Fe(III) could result in side
rxn and cap fade….”
• None of your tests demonstrate capacity fade conclusively, and
Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox is an obvious side reaction in this system.
Response: We thank a lot for reviewer’s useful comment. Fig.9 shows that
VRFB without Fe(III) presents the capacity of 0.99 Ah, which is larger than that
(0.92 Ah) with the Fe(III) concentration of 0.0196 mol L-1 and that (0.93 Ah) with
the Fe(III) concentration of 0.0286 mol L-1. The reason for the difference might be
that Fe(III) is competitive with vanadium ions for the adsorption on the electrode
surface and redox reaction, which results in the side reaction and capacity fading.
In addition, the electrochemical reaction and the vanadium ion diffusion became
difficult due to the increased electrolyte film resistance and interface resistance
resulted from too large amounts of Fe(III). The collision probability of vanadium
ions with Fe(III) increases due to the larger radius of Fe3+ (0.63 Å) compared to
that of V4+ (0.46 Å), V5+ (0.355 Å). Thus, the diffusion resistance of vanadium
ions increased when the concentration of Fe(III) was over 0.0196 mol L-1 in
anolyte. The increase of the collision probability and the competition charge-
discharge can interfere with the electrode reaction, the diffusion of vanadium ions,
and the performance of VRFB.
Figure 9: Charge-discharge curves of VRFB employing positive electrolytes
with different concentration of Fe(III) at the discharge current density of 40
mA cm-2.
Comment :“Fe(III) can compete with V(x) for adsorption on electrode”
• Do you expect vanadium / Fe processes to be inner sphere or outer sphere?
Response: Thanks a lot for the reviewer’s useful suggestion. From my
personal point of view, the vanadium/Fe process maybe inner sphere or maybe
outer sphere. This may depend on the liquid phase mass transfer rate of vanadium
ion and iron ion in electrolyte.
Appendix C
The authors provided an updated manuscript to their working on exploring the
impurity effects on vanadium electrolytes as a means of providing information for
use of less than pure resources in VRFB applications. A systematic approach was
applied by addiing controlled concentrations of Fe(III) into the vanadium electrolyte
solution where an interesting performance enhancement occurred at low
concentrations of Fe(III), followed by a degradation in performance with increasing
Fe(III) concentrations. The work is important in providing a framework for pathways
of decreasing the electrolyte cost in future technological developments by exploring
the use of rich vanadium liquid, which is an intermediate step during vanadium
purification. While many points were addressed in the revision, there still remains a
few areas that could use additional thought and can be easily addressed.
Comment 1: Thank you for providing background information in regards to the total
iron content found in rich vanadium liquid. It would be beneficial for the author to
include the numerical value in the introduction to give the reader and idea as to
why certain concentrations were chosen for the work. This would help with driving
the justification for the work. If Deng Zhi-gan is capable of achieving 0.6 g/L of iron
then this provides context as to why this work is important.
Experimental:
Comment 1: A flow rate of 10 sccm sounds very low for a VRFB and leads to large
mass transport limitations and access to capacity when reacting the redox species,
especially with an active area of 25 cm2. It would be beneficial for the authors to
explore a case where flow rate does not dictate mass transport limitations. Please
see A. Tang et al. / Journal of Power Sources 248 (2014) 154-162 and J Appl
Electrochem (2011) 41:1175–1182 for flow rate studies
Comment 2: Could the authors please indicate the type of flow field used in this
work? e.g. serpentine or flow-through
Results and Discussion:
Comment 1: In regards to the response to Comment 2 in the rebuttal. This would be
nice to have in the supporting information as it is relevant to the temperature
stability of vanadium species.
Comment 2: The CV measurements were performed on 6 samples, as shown in
Table 2, yet Table 3 only shows the extracted values for 2 samples. It would be
beneficial to the reader to see the clear trend of increasing diffusion coefficient with
increasing iron content to the maximum, followed by the decrease in diffusion
coefficient with increasing Fe concentration above 0.02 M.
Comment 3: In regards to the response of Comment 9 in the experimental section of
the rebuttal. The CV’s went below 0.77 V, which is the redox potential of
Fe(III)/Fe(II) so it makes sense that some Fe(II) is present in solution. As long as the
potential remains above 0.77 V then Fe(II) formation should never occur, which a
pol curve should show. It would be beneficial to see what the pol curve shows as a
function of iron concentration, which is performed with an applied current while EIS
is performed at OCV (i.e. no current condition).
Comment 4: It is unclear why the authors added XRD and SEM to the manuscript as
this has little to do with the electrochemical properties of the vanadium species in
the presence of iron. This reviewer suggests that this addition be removed or moved
to supporting information as it detracts from the primary goal of the work.
Appendix D
Dear reviewers,
Thank you very much for your advices. We are truly grateful to you for the
constructive comments regarding our manuscript entitled “Effect of Fe(III) on the
positive electrolyte for vanadium redox flow battery”.( RSOS-181309)
Those comments are all valuable for improving our paper, as well as the
important guiding significance to our researches. We have studied comments
carefully and have made revisions. The revised portions are all marked in red in
the revised manuscript. The main revisions and the responses are as follows.
Reviewer 1:
Comment: The authors already revised their manuscript well. So, I can
recommend it to publish as now.
Response: We appreciate the reviewer a lot for the comment. Thank you very
much for the reviewer’s affirmation of our article.
Reviewer 2:
Comment 1: Thank you for providing background information in regards to
the total iron content found in rich vanadium liquid. It would be beneficial for the

Response: Thanks a lot for the reviewer’s useful suggestion. Considering the
reviewer’s useful suggestion, the Introduction of the manuscript have been
revised.
Experimental:
Comment 1: A flow rate of 10 sccm sounds very low for a VRFB and leads
to large mass transport limitations and access to capacity when reacting the redox
species, especially with an active area of 25 cm2. It would be beneficial for the
authors to explore a case where flow rate does not dictate mass transport
limitations. Please see A. Tang et al. / Journal of Power Sources 248 (2014) 154-
162 and J Appl Electrochem (2011) 41:1175–1182 for flow rate studies.
Response: We appreciate the reviewer a lot for the constructive comment.
We have careful researched the literatures (A. Tang et al. / Journal of Power
Sources 248 (2014) 154-162 and J Appl Electrochem (2011) 41:1175–1182). A.
Tang et al. found that for a 40-cell stack variable flow rates are superior to constant
flow rates for the given system design and the use of a flow factor of 7.5 with
respect to the theoretical flow rate can reach overall high system efficiencies for
different charge-discharge operations. The stack consists of 40 individual cells
and sits on top of the 1 m height electrolyte reservoirs, in which 200 L of 2 M
vanadium electrolyte solutions are stored at each side. D. Aaron et al. measured
the influence of the electrolyte flow rate on the polarization curve, and the
electrolyte flow rate for these measurements ranged from 10 up to 30 mL/min. In
their small laboratory-scale set-up, they were operating with limited electrolyte
reservoirs of up to 250 mL volume. In VRFB testing, the electrolyte flow rate
should be determined according to the volume of the electrolyte, the diameter of
the pipe and the graphite electrode area et al.. Cristina Flox et al. measured the
performance of the VRFB was using an in-house-designed flow cell system. The
area of the electrode in contact with electrolyte solution was 25 cm2 and each
electrolyte volume was 50 mL and the electrolyte flow rate to each side was 10
mL min-1. In our experiment, the area of the electrode in contact with electrolyte
solution was 25 cm2 and each electrolyte volume was 30 mL and the electrolyte
flow rate to each side was 10 mL min-1. So it is appropriate for our cell test using
the electrolyte flow rate of 10 mL min-1.

Comment 2: Could the authors please indicate the type of flow field used in

type of flow field is flow-through (as the figure shown below).
Results and Discussion:

would be nice to have in the supporting information as it is relevant to the
temperature stability of vanadium species.
Response: We appreciate the reviewer a lot for the constructive comment.
The response information have been added to the supplementary materials.
Comment 2: The CV measurements were performed on 6 samples, as shown
in Table 2, yet Table 3 only shows the extracted values for 2 samples. It would be
beneficial to the reader to see the clear trend of increasing diffusion coefficient
with increasing iron content to the maximum, followed by the decrease in
diffusion coefficient with increasing Fe concentration above 0.02 M.
Response: We thank a lot for reviewer’s useful comment. Considering the
reviewer’s useful suggestion, the revisions are as follows:

Comment 3: In regards to the response of Comment 9 in the experimental
section of the rebuttal. The CV’s went below 0.77 V, which is the redox potential
of Fe(III)/Fe(II) so it makes sense that some Fe(II) is present in solution. As long
as the potential remains above 0.77 V then Fe(II) formation should never occur,
which a pol curve should show. It would be beneficial to see what the pol curve
shows as a function of iron concentration, which is performed with an applied
current while EIS is performed at OCV (i.e. no current condition).
Response: Thanks a lot for the reviewer’s useful suggestion. We have
carefully considered this comment and made the Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV)
experiment between 0.4 V and 1.2 V at a scan rate of 0.001 V/s. Fig.4 showed the
LSV curves of 2.8M H2SO4 solution (not contain vanadium ion) with different
concentration of Fe(III). It can be observed that the current density was increased
with the concentration of Fe(III) at 1.0 V, which is the redox potential of
V(IV)/V(V) so it illustrated that iron ion perhaps competitive with vanadium ions
for the adsorption on the electrode surface and redox reaction.
If there are shortcomings, please criticize and correct them. We shall be glad
to receive your comments.

Comment 4: It is unclear why the authors added XRD and SEM to the
manuscript as this has little to do with the electrochemical properties of the
vanadium species in the presence of iron. This reviewer suggests that this addition
be removed or moved to supporting information as it detracts from the primary
goal of the work.
Response: We appreciate the reviewer a lot for the useful comment. The
addition information of XRD and SEM have been moved to the supplementary
materials.
Appendix E
Dear reviewers,
Thank you very much for your advices. We are truly grateful to you for the
constructive comments regarding our manuscript entitled “Effect of Fe(III) on the
positive electrolyte for vanadium redox flow battery”.(RSOS-181309.R1)
Those comments are all valuable for improving our paper, as well as the
important guiding significance to our researches. We have studied comments
carefully and have made revisions. The revised portions are all marked in red in
the revised manuscript. The main revisions and the responses are as follows.
Reviewer 3:
Comment 1: Please check and correct some typos in the manuscript, such as,
“square toot” should be “square root” in the line 45, page 11; and “Fe (III) have”
should be “Fe(III) has”
Response: Thanks a lot for the reviewer’s useful suggestion. Considering the
reviewer’s useful suggestion, the revisions are as follows:
1. Section 3.2: “a linear function of the square toot of scan rates” has been
revised as “a linear function of the square root of scan rates”. (Page 10/Line 197)
2. Section 3.3: “This indicated that the Fe(III) have a great influence” has
been revised as “This indicated that the Fe(III) has a great influence”. (Page
12/Line 238)
3. Section 3.4: “the electrolyte with Fe(III) have little effect” has been
revised as “the electrolyte with Fe(III) has little effect”. (Page 13/Line 267)
4. Section 3.5: “it was shown that Fe(III) have influence” has been revised
as “it was shown that Fe(III) has influence”. (Page 14/Line 272)
Comment 2: Actually, the redox reaction mechanisms of V(V)/V(IV) is one
of the key problems of VRFB. The authors have given a very brief discussion in
section 3.5 (page 15). To be more informative for the general audience, some
related references are suggested to be cited, for example:
a) J. Mater. Chem. A, 2015, 3, 16913 (a very good review of reaction
mechanisms in VRFB)
b) ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2018, 10, 20621 (a new study of V(V)/V(IV)
redox reaction mechanism)
Response: We appreciate the reviewer a lot for the constructive comment.
Considering the reviewer’s useful suggestion, the revisions are as follows:
Section 3.5: The electrode process of V(V)/V(IV) redox reaction mainly
include [29-32]: The C-OH functional groups behave as active sites for the
oxidation of VO2+ on the surface of the electrode. The first step in the reaction
involves an ion exchange process between VO2+ ions transported from the bulk of
the catholyte and the H+ ions of the phenolic functional groups on the carbon
surface. And then, an oxygen atom from the C-O functional group is transferred
to the VO2+ ions to form VO2+ on the surface of the electrode, while an electron is
transferred from VO2+ to the electrode along the C-O-V bond. In the final step, the
oxidation reaction is terminated by an ion-exchange between the VO2+ formed on
the electrode surface and the H+ ion in the electrolyte. During the discharge, the
redox reactions occur in the opposite directions.

Comment 3: One of the most important findings is the diffusivity of
vanadium ions will be enhanced by 0.0196 mol/L Fe(III), while decreased when
the concentration was over 0.0196 mol/L. It’s easy to understand the decreasement,
due to the diffusion resistance from larger radius of Fe(III) as explained in your
manuscript. However, what’s the reason for the increasement of vanadium
diffusive by lower concentration (0.0196 mol/L) of Fe(3+)? A brief explanation is
suggested to be added.
Response: We thank a lot for reviewer’s useful comment. A brief explanation
is added in Section 3.5, the revisions are as follows:
When the electrolyte with lower concentration (under 0.0196 mol L-1) of
Fe(III), the traces of Fe(III) maybe can facilitate dispersion of vanadium ions for
the synergy of coulombic repulsion and steric hindrance [25,26], and maybe
interfere in the association of vanadium ions to a certain degree, which result in
the electrode reaction activity is improved correspondingly.
