Not so clear. Author stated as "Data Accessibility: Data will be made available via Dryad upon
acceptance." Perhaps it will be great on the scientific community if authors share their Matlab, R,
Perl and/or CUDA scripts in addition to their fish tracking data. They made wonderful job for
fish tracking by developing these scripts.

The paper entitled “Validating two-dimensional leadership models on three-dimensionally
structured fish schools” by Watt et al. identified major parameters fish use during school. To do
it, authors first observed the relative position of each fish individual, the swimming directions,
the location in arena (depth in water column) and the hierarchy within a fish school. From these
observation, authors analyzed the highest probability of the leaders positions in the vertical axis
and in the horizontal plane informed by gravity or body orientation. Authors also tested whether
followers use 2-D or 3-D information. This manuscript is well written in clear smooth English and
provides enough data to support their major conclusions: 2-D tracking is sufficient to detect
schooling dynamics, therefore, fish should mainly use the 2-D information, and fish individuals
mainly follow the others in their front (± ~50° in azimuth, ± ~40° in elevation). I strongly support
the publication of this manuscript after answering following minor points.
General points:
1) Authors reported interesting insight of schooling dynamics that the leader frequently
turned to be followers or vice versa (the duration seems 2-5 sec). it will be very nice if authors
could describe in the discussion section whether this duration depends on their alert level and/or
the duration might be extended under the continuous alert state such as presence of a predator.
2) In the discussion section, the authors suggested the involvement of lateral line and visual
systems for schooling by describing visual system further detail. In the paper of Kowalko et al.,
2013 Curr Biol, they showed genetic, microsurgical and pharmacological evidences that this
species mainly relies on the visual system instead of lateral line to follow the group of conspecies.
It would be nicer if authors include this report in the discussion.
Minor points:
1) Fish used in this study is Astyanax mexicanus. If this fish group is provided by
Yamamoto’s laboratory at Univ College London, common name should be described as Mexican
tetra. Banded tetra is for Asytanax aneus having a deeper body, and is distributed at the southern
area of Mexico, Transmexican volcanic belt. If their fish is from this area and has a deeper body
than Astyanax mexicanus, authors should correct this fish name as A. aneus.
2) The statistics were well explained and adequately applied as far as I noticed. But, some
of the statistics were not in the standard expression. For example, around line 44 page 10, authors
described “R2 = 74%”. Technically, it is fine expression but it would be better with standard
scientific/statistical expression like “R2 = 0.74”. please check other part as well.

I think that this is a well-executed and important study, which will make a very valuable
contribution to the literature. The manuscript is well-written and clearly states its objectives and
findings. My comments are correspondingly brief and amount to requests for additional
information.
Line 101: Can you comment a little further on the provenance of the fish? More importantly could
you provide information on the size of the fish so that the reader can interpret information such
as the distances between leaders and followers in terms of body lengths?
Line 116: Please provide further information on the synchronisation of the cameras. I’m assuming
that camera B always lags camera A by a few milliseconds, rather than the lag being plus or
minus 8 milliseconds within the same film.
Given that you used only two cameras, how did you deal with the problem of occlusion?
Line 128: Why didn’t you use a standardised and more repeatable stimulus to elicit the anti-
predator response? This would have been setter, surely? Regardless, please elaborate on this
approach and how you standardised it between replicates.
Line 189: Can you specify your term ‘section’ in the analyses, just for the sake of clarity.
Results: It would be simple enough to produce a heat map to show space use in 3 dimensions and
in 2 dimensions and I think it would be a worthwhile addition (although I note that the SI
provides some similar info)

after answering following minor points.
We thank the reviewer for their positive feedback and hope the changes made are
satisfactory.
General points:
1) Authors reported interesting insight of schooling dynamics that the leader
frequently turned to be followers or vice versa (the duration seems 2-5 sec). it will be
very nice if authors could describe in the discussion section whether this duration
depends on their alert level and/or the duration might be extended under the
continuous alert state such as presence of a predator.
We agree this is an interesting point and have therefore added a section that
discusses how the schooling dynamics are related to the anti-predator response,
emphasizing that this may not be the same for other less urgent behaviours (Lines
284-288).
2) In the discussion section, the authors suggested the involvement of lateral line
and visual systems for schooling by describing visual system further detail. In the
paper of Kowalko et al., 2013 Curr Biol, they showed genetic, microsurgical and
pharmacological evidences that this species mainly relies on the visual system
instead of lateral line to follow the group of conspecies. It would be nicer if authors
include this report in the discussion.
We agree that this is an important paper to include and have included in the
discussion (Lines 305-306) and into the references (Ref 35).
Minor points:
1) Fish used in this study is Astyanax mexicanus. If this fish group is provided by
Yamamoto’s laboratory at Univ College London, common name should be described
as Mexican tetra. Banded tetra is for Asytanax aneus having a deeper body, and is
distributed at the southern area of Mexico, Transmexican volcanic belt. If their fish is
from this area and has a deeper body than Astyanax mexicanus, authors should
correct this fish name as A. aneus.
Yes, they were provided by Yamamoto’s lab and are therefore Astyanax mexicanus.
We have altered the text to reflect this by removing banded from the name and
describing where they came from (Lines 101-103).
2) The statistics were well explained and adequately applied as far as I noticed.
But, some of the statistics were not in the standard expression. For example, around
line 44 page 10, authors described “R2 = 74%”. Technically, it is fine expression but
it would be better with standard scientific/statistical expression like “R2 = 0.74”.
please check other part as well.
We have checked the statistics to ensure they are written in standard expression.
Line 230 we have changed 74% to 0.74 as suggested.

I think that this is a well-executed and important study, which will make a very
valuable contribution to the literature. The manuscript is well-written and clearly
states its objectives and findings. My comments are correspondingly brief and
amount to requests for additional information.
We again thank the reviewer for their positive feedback and hope we have added the
extra information required.
Line 101: Can you comment a little further on the provenance of the fish? More
importantly could you provide information on the size of the fish so that the reader
can interpret information such as the distances between leaders and followers in
terms of body lengths?
We have included information about where the fish originally came (Methods, line
that this information should also be included in the main text. We have amended this.
(Lines 104-105).
Line 116: Please provide further information on the synchronisation of the cameras.
I’m assuming that camera B always lags camera A by a few milliseconds, rather than
the lag being plus or minus 8 milliseconds within the same film.
We have provided the relevant additional information to lines 119-120.
Given that you used only two cameras, how did you deal with the problem of
occlusion?
We dealt with the rare occasions of occlusion, by using epipolar geometry provided
by the three-dimension calibration, giving one dimension which the fish was present.
The animal was manually identified along this one-dimensional line.
Line 128: Why didn’t you use a standardised and more repeatable stimulus to elicit
the anti-predator response? This would have been setter, surely? Regardless,
please elaborate on this approach and how you standardised it between replicates.
We standardized the approach by using the same research and the same timings to
ensure the same shoals received the same treatment. We did try other techniques to
elicit a response but none elicited the required reliable shoaling response.
Line 189: Can you specify your term ‘section’ in the analyses, just for the sake of
clarity.
We have added in the specification of the term ‘section’ in Line 194.
Results: It would be simple enough to produce a heat map to show space use in 3
dimensions and in 2 dimensions and I think it would be a worthwhile addition
(although I note that the SI provides some similar info)
We thank the reviewer for the advice and have added an additional figure showing
the three-dimensional tracks into the SI, as Figure S3 (Lines 199). This helps
visualize the three-dimensional aspect and the space use.
