This study aimed to determine if a basic SIR compartment model that included flies as a
mechanical vector and incorporated a seasonally forced environment compartment could be used
to capture the observed disease dynamics of Campylobacter in Ontario, Canada.
The model was calibrated using one season's public health surveillance data on
campylobacteriosis incidence, and validated using multi-season data on campylobacteriosis
incidence. The validated model was used to determine potential changes to campylobacteriosis
incidence using predicted changes to fly population size and fly activity under multiple climate
change scenarios.
This is a very careful mathematical modeling study. The analysis convincingly supports the
conclusions.
The reviewer would like to point out one limitation on the modeling study, regarding model
validation. The model, as described on page 25, has three kinds of hosts, human, flies, and
environment (B). The surveillance data used for fitting and validation is only for human hosts;
there is no independent data for flies or the environment to validate these two parts of the model.
While it is reality that no such data exists, it is a limitation on the modeling study. The reviewer
would like to see this limitation discussed in the discussion, so that other readers can be aware of
it.

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science charge article processing charges for all new
submissions that are accepted for publication. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to
Royal Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers
submitted as part of our collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry

Appendix A
Reviewer 1:
1. This study aimed to determine if a basic SIR compartment model that
included flies as a mechanical vector and incorporated a seasonally
forced environment compartment could be used to capture the
observed disease dynamics of Campylobacter in Ontario, Canada.
We appreciate that the aim of the study was clear.
2. The model was calibrated using one season's public health
surveillance data on campylobacteriosis incidence, and validated using
multi-season data on campylobacteriosis incidence. The validated
model was used to determine potential changes to campylobacteriosis
incidence using predicted changes to fly population size and fly
activity under multiple climate change scenarios.
We appreciate that the methods of model calibration and validation
were clear.
3. This is a very careful mathematical modeling study. The analysis
convincingly supports the conclusions.
We gratefully thank the Reviewer for the review of this paper and are
pleased with the feedback.
4. The reviewer would like to point out one limitation on the modeling
study, regarding model validation. The model, as described on page
25, has three kinds of hosts, human, flies, and environment (B). The
surveillance data used for fitting and validation is only for human
hosts; there is no independent data for flies or the environment to
validate these two parts of the model. While it is reality that no such
data exists, it is a limitation on the modeling study. The reviewer
would like to see this limitation discussed in the discussion, so that
other readers can be aware of it.
Following the Reviewer’s suggestion, we have added a section to the
limitation section: This model was calibrated and validated using
human incidence only and therefore does not use independent data
for the fly or environment reservoirs. Since empirical data for these
reservoirs does not exist at this scale, these values were obtained
through model fitting and could not be independently validated. This
is an important limitation of the model and suggests that the
collection of additional data for further model validation would be a
useful next step. (Page 16, Line 356-360)
