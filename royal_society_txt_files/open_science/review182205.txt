The manuscript is easy to follow and has an appropriate structure. It is an interesting
experimental study and might have applications in the coal mine environmental protection.
However, there are some contents needing to be modified to improve the quality of the
manuscript. Therefore, I suggest a minor revision before the manuscript could be accepted for
publication. The following suggestions and comments should be considered when revising the
manuscript.
Specific Comments:
No.1: the compaction of crushed waste rock was the main focus of this study, which is the main
method to quantify the compaction process.
No.2: The lateral pressure applied was 2 MPa. Why the authors set the values for the lateral
pressure and loading cycle?
No.3: Page 6 line 15, add an introductory sentence, before start describing the steps.
No.4: Figure 2 is similar to Figure 3. The authors should consider to merge into one figure.
No.5: In section 4, comparing Equations (1), (3), (4) and (5), it results that h=hh and h==: why do
the authors use different symbols for the same dimensions?
No. 6: Page 10 line 33, the authors should provide a formula defining the lateral pressure
coefficient, please clarify.
No. 7: In the introduction and in the conclusions, greater emphasis must be placed on the fields of
application of this research, not only about the experiment.

In this paper, a self-made bidirectional test system is used to test effects of lithology on
compaction behaviors of waste rocks, which will provide the lithology selection for the backfill
materials. Meanwhile, the research results will be helpful to reduce the pollutions in mine areas.
The paper is interesting and is worthy of consideration for publication in the RSOS. However,
many details are missing. The reviewer has some minor corrections or comments that the authors
need to address to improve the quality of the paper.
According to the contents of sample preparation and test scheme, the waste rock sample is not
belonging to coal gangue, which kind of the waste rock is used as the samples?
If this size of the loading box is enough for waste rock samples, please add the explanation.
Figure 4 is not necessary. The test steps have been stated in the main text. It should be deleted.
Page 6: line 23-24, after placing each layer, the rock blocks were pre-compacted until all layers
were loaded. Not very clear. Please, rephrase or explain a bit better.
Page 10: line 32-34, by the term lateral pressure coefficient you mean the ratio of horizontal to
vertical stresses?
Porosity usually represents the ratio between the volume of void and the total volume of a given
material, containing also this void. On the other hand, h and in Equations (4) and (7) represent
something similar to the volumetric strain (-)/, which is the ratio between the variation of
volume and the original volume.

Appendix A
Dear editor and reviewers,
On behalf of my co-authors, we thank you very much for giving us an
opportunity to revise our manuscript. We are grateful to the editor and reviewers for
their positive and constructive comments and suggestions on our manuscript entitled
“An experimental study of the influence of lithology on compaction behaviour of
broken waste rock in coal mine backfill” (RSOS-182205). These comments have all
been of great help to us in the revision and improvement of our paper, as well as
providing significant guidance for our research.
We have revised our manuscript according to the comments from the reviewers
and have used a professional language editing service to improve its grammar and
writing style. We hope that the manuscript now meets with your approval. The main
corrections to the paper and our responses to the reviewers are as follows:
Responds to Reviewer #1
No. 1: The compaction of crushed waste rock was the main focus of this study, which
is the main method to quantify the compaction process.
Response: Thank you for your positive comments. The “Method of compaction
testing of solid backfilling materials” is used as the testing method for the compaction
characteristics of broken waste rocks, which was issued by the China’s National
Energy Administration. The authors have added this standard as the reference in the
revised manuscript.
No. 2: The lateral pressure applied was 2 MPa. Why the authors set the values for the
lateral pressure and loading cycle?
Response: Thank you for your positive comments. The lateral pressure (2 MPa) was
set according to the engineering applications.
No. 3: Page 6 line 15, add an introductory sentence, before start describing the steps.
Response: Thank you for your positive comments. The authors have added the
introductory sentence.
No. 4: Figure 2 is similar to Figure 3. The authors should consider to merge into one
figure.
Response: Thank you for your positive comments. The authors have merged Figure
and Figure 3 into one Figure in the revised manuscript.
No. 5: In section 4, comparing Equations (1), (3), (4) and (5), it results that h<U+0001D460>=hh and
<U+0001D43F>h=<U+0001D459><U+0001D460>=<U+0001D459><U+0001D463>: why do the authors use different symbols for the same dimensions?
Response: Thank you for your positive comments. The authors used different symbols
for the different dimensions.
No. 6: Page 10 line 33, the authors should provide a formula defining the lateral
pressure coefficient, please clarify.
Response: Thank you for your positive comments. The authors have added the
formula in the revised manuscript.
No. 7: In the introduction and in the conclusions, greater emphasis must be placed on
the fields of application of this research, not only about the experiment.
Response: Thank you for your positive comments. The authors tried their best to add
more detailed information about the fields of application of this paper’s research.
Special thanks to you for your good comments again. They are valuable and very
helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding
significance to our researches.
Responds to Reviewer #2
No. 1: According to the contents of sample preparation and test scheme, the waste
rock sample is not belonging to coal gangue, which kind of the waste rock is used as
the samples?
Response: Thank you for your positive comments. The waste rock produced during
tunneling was used as the testing samples.
No. 2: If this size of the loading box is enough for waste rock samples, please add the
explanation.
Response: Thank you for your positive comments. The maximum particle size of the
waste rock sample is 30mm. And the minimum size of the loading box is 200mm. The
ratio of the minimum size of the loading box to the maximum particle size of the
waste rock sample is bigger than 6.
No. 3: Figure 4 is not necessary. The test steps have been stated in the main text. It
should be deleted.
Response: Thank you for your positive comments. The authors have deleted Figure 4
in the revised manuscript.
No. 4: Page 6: line 23-24, after placing each layer, the rock blocks were
pre-compacted until all layers were loaded. Not very clear. Please, rephrase or explain
a bit better.
Response: Thank you for your positive comments. The authors have added more
information in the revised manuscript about this sentence.
No. 5: Page 10: line 32-34, by the term lateral pressure coefficient you mean the ratio
of horizontal to vertical stresses?
Response: Thank you for your positive comments. The lateral pressure coefficient is
the ratio of horizontal to vertical stresses. The authors have added one formula in the
revised manuscript.
No. 6: Porosity usually represents the ratio between the volume of void and the total
volume of a given material, containing also this void. On the other hand, <U+0001D719>h and <U+0001D719><U+0001D463> in
Equations (4) and (7) represent something similar to the volumetric strain
(<U+0001D449><U+0001D453><U+0001D456><U+0001D45B><U+0001D44E><U+0001D459>-<U+0001D449><U+0001D456><U+0001D45B><U+0001D456><U+0001D461><U+0001D456><U+0001D44E><U+0001D459>)/<U+0001D449><U+0001D456><U+0001D45B><U+0001D456><U+0001D461><U+0001D456><U+0001D44E><U+0001D459>, which is the ratio between the variation of volume and the
original volume.
Response: Thank you for your positive comments. The <U+0001D719>h and <U+0001D719><U+0001D463> are calculated by
Formula (4) and (7), <U+0001D449>h or <U+0001D449>v represents the volume of specimen (broken), the <U+0001D449>0
represents the volume of specimen (not broken), <U+0001D449>h - <U+0001D449>0 or <U+0001D449>v - <U+0001D449>0 represents the
volume of void.
Special thanks to you for your good comments again. They are valuable and very
helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding
significance to our researches.
