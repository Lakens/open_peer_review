This paper presents a statistical analysis of a large data pertaining to “indicative” measure of Bt
resistance in Helicoverpa zea (abundance, population growth stage, various damage measures)
for one corn production area in the USA collected over many years. The authors point out
statistical relationships between Bt corn area and rising temperature effects. There appear to be
some interesting relationships (additive and interactive). As always with these sorts of fishing
trips it is important to propose possible mechanisms.
I have annotated the manuscript extensively with comments and suggestions for revision. The
major area needing attention is the discussion that can be greatly shortened. There is certainly
grounds here for further research. (Appendix A)

This paper analyzed the influence of climate change and Bt acreage to population abundance and
resistance in H. zea to Bt corn. It is a novel idea to link the climate change to Bt resistance and the
author demonstrated a good skill for data analysis. I have only one concern. It is evident that the
temperature increased through time. At the same time, Bt resistance also accumulated through
time. So, how to exclude the possibility that the increase of Bt resistance is due to evolution
through time? What will happen if the author include time as a predictor? So, I am not very
confident at the conclusion that the temperature anomaly accelerate the Bt resistance evolution.
Minor comments:
The Latin names of insects and crops should be in the same format through the whole paper,
namely, genus name followed by species name and the name of the person who described this
3
species. There is no need to provide the year or the name who revised the species. The L in Line70
of page 3 should not be in italic.
For legend of Figure 3, I don’t understand what the bracketed B following the words “Bt corn
acreage” for.

Associate Editor's comments:
Comments to the Author:
A major point made by reviewer 1 is that the discussion should be shortened, while retaining the
consideration of mechanisms behind the observed correlations. Additionally, reviewer 1 inserted
a number of comments into the manuscript, and highlighted areas in need of linguistic editing.
5
Reviewer 2 raises doubts about the causal relationship between increase of BT resistance and
increasing temperature anomalies. This issue should be addressed in the discussion, if possible
with inclusion of relevant literature.
I have a few comments on the presentation of the results. The linear models detected a number of
significant interactions, which should be explicitly explained in the text of the results section. For
instance, in the first model (H. zea abundance), the interaction signifies that the effect of
temperature anomaly decreases with increasing BT acreage.
Dataset S1 does not contain results, although line 288 advertises results in S1 - exploratory
analyses which were used to determine the selected models should be presented here. The
supplemented tables should also come with an explanation why data were divided into two sets,
and how each of these datasets was treated in the analysis.

12 Abstract
4
5
6 13 Increased temperature anomaly during the 21st century coincides with the proliferation of
7 14 transgenic crops containing the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner) (Bt) to express
8 15 insecticidal Cry proteins. Increasing temperatures profoundly affect insect life histories, and
9 16 agricultural pest management. However, the implications of altered pest insect biology during
10
11
17 warmer climate on Bt crop-pest interactions, efficacy of transgenic plants, and insect resistance
12 18 to Bt crops remains unexamined. With data spanning 1996-2016, we quantify the role of
13 19 temperature anomaly and Bt adoption on the field-evolved resistance to Cry1Ab Bt sweet corn in
14 20 Helicoverpa zea (Boddie, 1850), a major pest. H. zea population declined with increased Bt
15 21 adoption, although increased temperature anomaly buffers population reduction. However, H.
16
22 zea damage to corn ears, kernel area consumed, mean instars, and proportion of late instars in Bt
17
18 23 varieties increased with temperature anomaly and Bt adoption, through additive or interactive
19 24 effects. The risk of Bt resistant H. zea spreading to other U.S. corn producing areas is high due to
20 25 expected increase in overwintering and migration. Our study highlights the challenges for
21 26 agricultural pest management through Bt biotechnology in the context of climate change, and the
22 27 need to incorporate evolutionary processes affected by climate change into Bt resistance
23
24 28 management programs.

31 Introduction
31
32 32 Climatic change, as indicated by the highest global average temperatures on record,
33 33 impacts agricultural productivity globally. Sixteen of the 17 warmest years recorded since 1880
34 34 occurred in the 21st century, and land surface temperature anomaly (difference as compared to
35
35 20th century) during 2016 reached 1.43°C (1). With the increasing average temperatures,
36
37 36 agricultural yield losses and management costs are expected to rise due to the changes in
38 37 geographic range and infestation intensity of crop pests (2,3). Pests exacerbate agricultural costs
39 38 of climate change; thus, incorporating their effects on agricultural productivity can aid in
40 39 developing robust climate change mitigation strategies (2,4). However, crop-pest interactions are
41 40 complex and poorly understood in the context of climate change. Direct climate impacts on pests
42
43
41 (e.g. life history traits) are better understood than the indirect effects (such as crop-pest
44 42 interactions) resulting in a gap between the science of predicting changes and management
45 43 options (4,5).
46
47 44 Insects are major economic pests, and increasing temperature anomalies and warming
48
45 have profound influence on insect biology and agricultural pest management. Rising
49
50 46 temperatures accelerate insect phenology (6), and could exacerbate agricultural problems from
51 47 migratory pests (7). Polyphagous, migratory insect pest species can benefit from warmer
52 48 temperatures (7–9) although climate change effects on insects in general are varied. Migratory
53 49 agricultural insect pest responses to warmer temperatures include extension of geographical and
54 50 overwintering range, increased overwintering survival, accelerated population growth, increased
55
56 51 number of generations, increased feeding injury, earlier colonization of crops, and increased risk

52 of invasive pests. These responses may alter the crop-pest synchrony, interactions among
4
5 53 species, and pest management strategies (5,7–14).
6
7 54 Currently, a key insect pest management strategy in major agricultural nations is the
8 55 genetic engineering of crops through agricultural biotechnology. The period of increased
9 56 temperature anomaly in the 21st century coincides with the proliferation of crops engineered with
10
11
57 genes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner) (Bt) to express insecticidal toxins. Bt
12 58 crops are safe for human health and provide many benefits through reduced pest populations and
13 59 pesticide usage, and increased profits (15–17). Bt crops are adopted extensively with global
14 60 plantings across 28 countries reaching about 178 million ha in 2015, from 1.1 million ha in 1996
15 61 (18). However, the implications of altered pest insect biology and phenology during warmer
16
62 climate on transgenic crop-pest interactions is complex and largely unexamined. In this study,
17
18 63 we address the role of increasing temperature anomaly and its interaction with agricultural
19 64 biotechnology (Bt crops) to understand some of the indirect impacts of climate change: crop-pest
20 65 interaction, efficacy of Bt corn for insect pest management, and Bt resistance in insects.
21
22 66 Agricultural biotechnology, through molecular breeding and genetic engineering, could
23
24 67 significantly help to mitigate the effects of climate change on agricultural production (19,20). To
25 68 utilize agricultural biotechnology for mitigating climate change impacts, we need to understand
26 69 its risks and limitations versus benefits. The regional adoption of Bt maize (corn; Zea mays L.)
27 70 and Bt cotton (Gossypium sp. L.) provides economic benefits by suppressing pest populations
28 71 and damage from lepidopteran pests (15,21–23). Bt adoption, however, exacerbates selection
29
30
72 pressure and risks of resistance evolution because the ‘high dosage’ of Bt toxin, a requirement
31 73 for resistance management (24), is not expressed for all targeted pests. With widespread use of
32 74 Bt crops, insect resistance is the major threat to the sustainability of the Bt transgenic technology
33 75 (25). Resistance to the insecticidal toxins are on the rise with 5 major insect pest species
34 76 developing field-evolved resistance (sensu Tabashnik et al. (26)) to Bt crops worldwide (25,27).
35
36
37 77 While the role of biotechnology regulatory policies and insect resistance management
38 78 strategies for the sustainability of Bt technology is well documented (28), Bt crop-pest
39 79 interactions and Bt crop efficacy in the context of climate change has received scant attention.
40 80 Evolutionary adaptation to counter ecological stress during climate change may be rapid (29),
41 81 and understanding its relevance for Bt biotechnology will help pest management. Climate
42
43
82 change, through increased voltinism (5,9,30), may buffer the population reduction from Bt crops
44 83 especially for polyphagous crop pests targeted by Bt technology. Environmental factors such as
45 84 temperature, salinity, water logging or drought conditions affect the expression of Bt toxin
46 85 proteins in transgenic plants, and their efficacy (31–35). Coupled with accelerated phenology and
47 86 increasing ranges (overwintering and distributional) of target pests (11,14,36), climate change
48
87 effects may alter the susceptibility to Cry proteins expressed in Bt crops and pose increased risks
49
50 88 for resistance development and sustainability of the Bt technology. Knowledge of the effects of
51 89 environmental factors on the efficacy of transgenic plants and pest resistance development is
52 90 essential for sustainability of Bt technology, and to effectively utilize it for pest management in
53 91 the context of climate change.
54
55
56
92 One of the targets of the Bt crops is the polyphagous corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea
57 93 (Boddie, 1850), a key pest of many agricultural crops including sweet corn, field corn, cotton,

4
5 95 America, H. zea is a long distant migrant (37) distributed throughout most of eastern and mid-
6 96 western United States and southern Canada. As pupae that diapause in the soil, it overwinters in
7 97 areas south of 40°N (38). However, its overwintering and distribution ranges are predicted to
8 98 expand due to warmer temperatures (11), leading to changes in arrival and intensity of
9 99 infestations in northern latitudes (39).
10
11
12 100 For all Bt corn expressing Cry toxins, the high dose requirement for resistance
13 101 management is not achieved for H. zea which is more tolerant to the Bt toxins. Due to this
14 102 ‘moderate dose’ expression, the risk of evolution of resistance increases in areas where Bt field
15 103 corn is widely adopted, and H. zea overwinters successfully (40). Recently, Dively et al. (2016)
16
104 described and characterized the field-evolved resistance in H. zea to multiple Cry toxins,
17
18 105 including pyramided traits expressed in transgenic sweet corn. Many sweet corn farmers in
19 106 Maryland, USA either have stopped growing these Bt hybrids or are applying more insecticide
20 107 sprays to compensate for the reduced control efficacy. With resistant populations in Maryland,
21 108 which historically represented northern range of overwintering (41), H. zea resistance to Bt corn
22 109 may spread and increase.
23
24
25 110 Simulations predict that the regional deployment of Bt crops affect average gene
26 111 frequencies, and therefore incomplete technology adoption can slow resistance evolution (42,43).
27 112 Conversely, extensive adoption of Bt technology increases selection pressure for H. zea
28 113 resistance evolution. Contrastingly, models also predict that resistance could evolve rapidly in
29
30
114 other Helicoverpa sp. when Bt crops are rare in the landscape, rather than common (44).
31 115 However, field evaluations of these simulation models quantifying the relationship between H.
32 116 zea resistance to Cry proteins and Bt crop adoption in the landscape are not available. Such
33 117 information is necessary to predict vulnerability of crops to increased damage due to the spread
34 118 of Bt resistant H. zea under climate change scenarios. In this study, we use two decades of field
35 119 efficacy data on Bt sweet corn to examine the role of temperature anomaly and Bt adoption on
36
37 120 field-evolved resistance in H. zea to Cry toxins.
38
39 121 Methods
40
41 122 Indicators of field-evolved resistance
42
43
44 123 We used the data provided by Dively et al. (25,45) on measures of control efficacy and
45 124 changes in susceptibility that indicate field-evolved resistance of H. zea to Bt Cry proteins. They
46 125 established sentinel plots of Cry1Ab expressing Bt sweet corn hybrids paired with non-Bt
47 126 isogenic hybrids, and evaluated H. zea infestations and abundances during 1996-2016 in
48
127 Maryland, USA. We used percentage of ears damaged by H. zea, mean kernel area consumed,
49
50 128 mean instars, and proportion of late instars (4th – 6th instars) in Bt hybrids (henceforth damage,
51 129 consumption, instar, and late instars respectively) as indicators of field-evolved resistance to
52 130 Cry1Ab in sweet corn. See Dively et al. (25) for details on field protocols and data collection
53 131 procedures. We used the mean nightly captures of H. zea moths in black light traps during 1996-
54 132 2014 (henceforth counts) as measure of population abundance.

133 Transgenic corn acreage and temperature anomaly data

6 134 As predictors of field-evolved resistance, we used Bt corn (including field corn) acreage
7 135 in the agricultural crop districts of the study sites in Maryland
8 136 (https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/Crops_County/boundary_maps/md.gif) as a
9 137 measure of Bt adoption. The Bt events and Cry proteins expressed in field corn are also
10
11
138 expressed in sweet corn (except for Cry1F). For e.g. Attribute (expressing Cry1Ab toxin, event
12 139 Bt11) and Attribute II (expressing Cry1Ab and Vip3A, event MIR162) hybrids from Syngenta
13 140 Seeds, and Performance Series (PS) hybrids (expressing the Cry1A.105 and Cry2Ab2 toxins,
14 141 event MON89034) from Seminis Seeds. Therefore, Bt field corn acreage, which represent 99%
15 142 all corn acreage in the U.S., is a good measure of the evolutionary selection pressure for
16
143 resistance development in H. zea against Bt Cry proteins. Surrounding landscape composition
17
18 144 and area under corn production differed among the study sites, representing a range of selection
19 145 pressure for resistance development. Crops (particularly corn) are planted extensively around the
20 146 sites on the Eastern Shore, while western Maryland sites include urban areas.We estimated the Bt
21 147 corn acreage in the agricultural districts as the product of total area of corn planted each year
22 148 (46), and the national average percentage of Bt corn for that year (47).
23
24
25 149 We compiled the temperature anomaly data for the respective climatic divisions
26 150 (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/maps/us-climate-divisions.php). Temperature
27 151 anomalies, particularly warmer temperatures, during the growing season (spring to summer) are
28 152 related to increased number of generations (9), earlier arrival of migratory insect pests, and
29
30
153 increased feeding and crop damages (7). We downloaded data on temperature anomaly during
31 154 the growing seasons (spring – summer; Apr – Sept.) of the study period (1996-2016), for each
32 155 agricultural district, from NOAA—National Climatic Data Center
33 156 (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series).
34
35
157 Statistical analysis
36
37
38 158 Linear mixed effects models (LMMs) were used to analyze the influence of temperature
39 159 anomaly and Bt acreage on H. zea abundance and on indicators of field-evolved resistance. The
40 160 LMMs contained each of the indicators (counts, damage, consumption, instar, and large instar)
41 161 as response variables, site as a random effect accounting for repeated measurement, and the
42
43
162 interaction, additive, or individual effect of Bt acreage and temperature anomaly as fixed effects.
44 163 We tested the interactive influence of Bt acreage and temperature anomaly prior to analyzing
45 164 additive or individual influences. Where applicable, the response variables were square root
46 165 transformed to conform to linear model assumptions. As exploratory analysis we first ran a set of
47 166 models that included the predictors as either linear, polynomial (second or third-order order
48
167 terms) for temperature anomaly, or logarithmic for Bt acreage functions as fixed effects. We
49
50 168 used Chi-square tests to compare and select the final model for each response (exploratory
51 169 analysis results not provided).
52
53 170 For the selected model, we determined the statistical significance of the fixed effects
54 171 through Wald F tests with Kenward-Roger approximation. Also, a likelihood-ratio based pseudo-
55
56 172 R2 value (48) was calculated for each model as a measure of the proportion of total variance
57 173 explained. We ensured model appropriateness through diagnostic plots of the models visualizing

6 176 (49); pgs. 174–197). Package ‘lme4’ (50) was used to construct the LMMs and pseudo-R2 values
7 177 were calculated using package ‘MuMIn’ (51). Estimated coefficients were extracted from the
8 178 LMMs and plotted using “ggplot2” (52) and “visreg” (53), all in R program (54).

11 179 Results
12
13 180 The interactive influences of temperature anomaly and log Bt acreage significantly
14 181 influenced the abundance of H. zea over the past two decades [F (1,77) = 35.6, P < 0.001, pseudo-
15 182 R2 = 0.53; see Table 1 for coefficients]. While the overall trend was negative, abundance was
16
17
183 highest at low Bt acreage and high temperature anomaly (Fig 1a).
18
19 184 For indicators of field-evolved resistance, damage was significantly positively associated
20 185 with additive effects of temperature anomaly and log Bt acreage [temperature anomaly - F (1,89) =
21 186 20.3, P < 0.001; Bt acreage - F (1,87) = 15.9, P < 0.001, pseudo-R2 = 0.49]. Damage to corn ears
22
187 increased with temperature anomaly (Fig 2a) and Bt acreage (Fig 2b; see Table 1 for
23
24 188 coefficients). Kernel consumption of Bt hybrids was significantly influenced positively by the
25 189 interactive influences of temperature anomaly (second-order term polynomial) and log Bt
26 190 acreage [F (1,75) = 5.04, P = 0.009, pseudo-R2 = 0.26; see Table 1 for coefficients]. Consumption
27 191 was highest with interactive effects of high temperature anomaly and Bt acreage (Fig 1b). Mean
28 192 instar was significantly positively associated with Bt acreage [F (1,86) = 13.7, P < 0.001, pseudo-
29
30
193 R2 = 0.15; Fig 3; see Table 1 for coefficients]. The proportion of late instars was significantly
31 194 positively associated with the interactive effects of temperature anomaly (third-order
32 195 polynomial) and log Bt acreage [F (1,142) = 16.8, P < 0.001, pseudo-R2 = 0.55; see Table 1 for
33 196 coefficients]. Proportion of late instars increased with Bt acreage and temperature anomaly (Fig
34 197 1c).

37 198 Discussion
38
39 199 We studied how temperature anomaly affects insect biology, transgenic crop-pest
40 200 interactions, and agricultural pest management through transgenic biotechnology. Our results
41 201 quantify the role of temperature anomaly and its interaction with increased Bt adoption on field-
42
43
202 evolved resistance in H. zea to Bt corn expressing Cry1Ab toxin. We provide field validations of
44 203 predictions from simulation models for H. zea (42,43), demonstrating that the elevated selection
45 204 pressure from extensive adoption of Bt corn in the mid-Atlantic region has enabled H. zea to
46 205 develop resistance to Cry1Ab. The ‘moderate dose’ delivered by Bt crops through Cry proteins
47 206 provides incomplete control (40) and increases selection pressure for resistance development.
48
207 While the evolution of resistance with increased Bt adoption was expected, our study highlights
49
50 208 the important interactive effect of climate change (temperature anomaly) for resistance
51 209 development.
52
53 210 Extensive regional adoption of Bt corn suppressed the population abundance of H. zea in
54 211 Maryland, similar to other reports on regional suppression of pests by Bt crops (15,21–23).
55
56 212 However, we found interactive and contrasting effects of temperature anomaly and Bt acreage on
57 213 H. zea abundance. H. zea populations were reduced overall, but H. zea abundance increased at
58

3
214 low Bt acreage with temperature anomaly, probably through increased voltinism (9,30). While
4
5 215 populations were suppressed regionally, these interactive and/or additive influences affected the
6 216 field-evolved resistance to Cry1Ab expressing Bt sweet corn. Previous anecdotal report alludes
7 217 to hot weather and high Bt acreage as reasons for the failure of Bt crops (Bt cotton) against H.
8 218 zea in Texas (55). H. zea evolutionary adaption to counter ecological stress from Bt adoption
9 219 could be facilitated by increasing temperatures during climate change, with implications for
10
11
220 management (29).
12
13 221 The mechanisms through which the interactive influences of increased Bt acreage and
14 222 temperature anomaly effect evolution of H. zea resistance to Cry protein in Bt corn are complex
15 223 as climate change effects span spatial scales (local to global) and levels of biological
16
224 organization (molecular to biosphere) (56,57). Studies on relationship between temperature and
17
18 225 toxicity of conventional chemical pesticides, and insect resistance, underscore the complex,
19 226 interactive role of the toxins, temperature range, and insect responses (58–60). Reduced toxicity
20 227 at higher temperatures is observed for some insecticides (58–60), and physiological mechanisms
21 228 play an important role in insect resistance to conventional pesticides at warmer temperatures
22 229 (58). Bt resistance, similarly, is affected by complex, interactive roles of Bt toxin expression in
23
24 230 plant, insect response, temperature range acting at multiple spatial scales, and at molecular to
25 231 ecosystem levels.
26
27 232 Cellular mechanisms of insect resistance to conventional pesticides are linked to
28 233 increased rates of metabolic processes, excretion and the reactivity at site of action at higher
29
30
234 temperature (e.g. Musca domestica resistance to pyrethroids; (58). The activity and expression of
31 235 alkaline phosphatase in the midgut binding sites is associated with resistance against Cry1F and
32 236 Cry1Ac in many target lepidopteran pests including H. zea (61–63). Enzymatic activity,
33 237 including that of alkaline phosphatase, typically increases with temperature until a threshold
34 238 temperature in varied biological organisms (64–66). The cross-resistance between the Cry1A
35 239 proteins (1Ab, 1Ac, Cry1A.105) in H. zea (67,68), and increased activity of alkaline phosphatase
36
37 240 at higher temperatures probably catalyzed the field-evolved resistance to Cry1Ab particularly
38 241 given high selection pressure with increased Bt adoption. Our results indicate that temperature
39 242 coupled with elevated selection pressure may have accelerated the localized Bt resistance
40 243 development in Maryland populations of H. zea.
41
42
43
244 At the local spatial scale, increased feeding at high temperatures (7,9) resulted in high
44 245 injury to Bt sweet corn. High temperatures may degrade soluble proteins in the Bt crop resulting
45 246 in decline of Cry1A toxin expression by the plant, and thereby reduced Bt crop efficacy (32).
46 247 Similarly, the accelerated phenology, population growth and voltinism (5,9,30) at warmer
47 248 temperatures may buffer against population reduction from Bt toxin, during resistance evolution.
48
249 Additionally, increased overwintering survival due to warmer temperatures, particularly reduced
49
50 250 length of time spent at near-zero temperatures (39), affect the population dynamics of target
51 251 species in Bt crops and can increase the resistance allele frequency that carries over to the
52 252 following spring season (69).
53
54 253 Concurrently, at regional/continental spatial scales, the earlier arrival and higher influx of
55
56
254 migratory resistant populations from the South due to warmer temperatures also may have aided
57 255 resistance development. The south-north migration of moths already selected for resistance on Bt

256 corn and cotton (70) probably enhanced the development of Cry1Ab resistance in Maryland
4
5 257 populations. The very high regional deployment of corn at both in the mid-Atlantic region, as
6 258 well as further south along the migratory route of H. zea probably also has exacerbated the
7 259 selection pressure for resistance development.
8
9 260 Our results have important implications for understanding the risk of resistance
10
11
261 increasing and spreading, sustainability of Bt technology and regional insect pest management
12 262 strategies for climate change preparedness. The expansion of overwintering range north of 40º N,
13 263 and increased migration due to climate change (11,25) increases the risk of Bt resistant H. zea
14 264 populations spreading to the corn belt in the U.S. The extensive Bt acreage in mid-Atlantic, north
15 265 central and northern great plains regions exert selection pressure which further exacerbate risk of
16
266 resistance increasing and spreading. These results highlight the necessity for adapting existing
17
18 267 regulatory policies on refuge requirement and resistance monitoring, given the expected impact
19 268 of climate change on corn earworm resistance development. Expanded resistance monitoring for
20 269 all Cry proteins registered against corn earworm at all high corn production regions including the
21 270 corn belt would help detect resistance development as the overwintering range of corn earworm
22 271 expands due to climate change. To date, corn earworm sampling for monitoring and testing for
23
24 272 resistance have focused on the southern U.S. regions where both Bt corn and cotton are grown.
25
26 273 Our study highlights risks and limitations of Bt technology for agricultural pest
27 274 management in the context of climate change. Polyphagous, migratory species such as H. zea
28 275 can benefit from warmer temperatures (7,9), and increased Bt exposure might lead to resistance
29
30
276 development particularly in insects for which Cry proteins express moderate toxicity. Hence
31 277 there is a need to incorporate the evolutionary processes affected by climate change into
32 278 resistance management programs. Our results thereby validate the integration of insect resistance
33 279 management to Bt crops with several compatible integrated pest management (IPM) strategies to
34 280 better manage insect resistance in the context of climate change. Given the role of temperature
35 281 and increased Bt adoption for resistance development, incorporating insect resistance
36
37 282 management plans into broader IPM strategies (biological control, crop rotation etc.) could
38 283 ameliorate selection pressure, and facilitate sustainability of Bt technology (24). Finally, detailed
39 284 experiments relating toxicity and resistance development at varied Bt concentrations to
40 285 temperature conditions are needed to clearly identify the mechanisms through with Bt adoption
41 286 and climate change interactively influence field-evolved resistance.

ociate Editor's comments:
mments to the Author:
ajor point made by reviewer 1 is that the discussion should be shortened, while retaining the
sideration of mechanisms behind the observed correlations. Additionally, reviewer 1 inserted
umber of comments into the manuscript, and highlighted areas in need of linguistic editing.
shortened the discussion from 8 to 6 paragraphs, and addressed all of reviewer 1’s
mments / suggestions (see below).
iewer 2 raises doubts about the causal relationship between increase of BT resistance and
reasing temperature anomalies. This issue should be addressed in the discussion, if possible
h inclusion of relevant literature.
ase see response to Reviewer 2 below
ve a few comments on the presentation of the results. The linear models detected a number of
nificant interactions, which should be explicitly explained in the text of the results section. For
ance, in the first model (H. zea abundance), the interaction signifies that the effect of
perature anomaly decreases with increasing BT acreage.
included additional sentences in the results section describing the significant
ractions for each model, where applicable.
aset S1 does not contain results, although line 288 advertises results in S1 - exploratory
lyses which were used to determine the selected models should be presented here. The
plemented tables should also come with an explanation why data were divided into two sets,
how each of these datasets was treated in the analysis.
he original submission the exploratory analyses helped identify appropriate model
ong candidate models each containing temperature anomaly as linear or polynomial
dictor (2nd / 3rd order). In the revised submission we reanalyzed the data including
y linear effects of temperature anomaly (removing all polynomial effects) and,
refore, no model selection. The exploratory analysis portion in entirely removed.
e original Dataset S1 file contained two tables (retained as provided by Dively et al
16) as the number of available rows of data was higher for the proportion of late
tars. The analysis is not affected as separate models were run for each variable
icating field-evolved resistance to Cry1Ab Bt corn (counts, damage, consumption,
an instar and proportion of late instars). We consolidated this into a single file
vide here.

s paper presents a statistical analysis of a large data pertaining to “indicative” measure of Bt
stance in Helicoverpa zea (abundance, population growth stage, various damage measures)
one corn production area in the USA collected over many years. The authors point out
istical relationships between Bt corn area and rising temperature effects. There appear to be
e interesting relationships (additive and interactive). As always with these sorts of fishing
s it is important to propose possible mechanisms.
ve annotated the manuscript extensively with comments and suggestions for revision. The
or area needing attention is the discussion that can be greatly shortened. There is certainly
unds here for further research.
sponse – We thank the reviewer for their time, and the constructive criticism. To quell
doubts about the collinearity among predictors, and to limit the ‘fishing trip’, we
nalyzed the data including only linear effects of temperature anomaly as predictors
d not as polynomial effects which might affect collinearity) wherever applicable. The
ults and conclusions are the same, barring minor changes in the model predictions

tion which is now trimmed from 8 to 6 paragraphs. We concur that there is grounds
further research!

ssure.”

4. You analyzed for abundance - why not look at population growth rate? May capture the
ct of temperature and corn better?
sponse – We agree with the reviewer that population growth rate may better capture
effect of temperature and Bt acreage than abundance. However, the abundance
a was either not available for each study site each year, or was not uniform with
ps for more than 5 years in some cases. So it was not suitable for population growth
e calculation, and hence we used the yearly raw abundance data provided by Dively
al. (2016).
4. greater egg laying? Bt corn is available only "once" (for 1 generation) please clarify
sponse – Helicoverpa zea in Maryland goes through 2-3 generations during the
wing period, not just one. On warmer years they can complete 3 generations, and

mments to the Author(s)
s paper analyzed the influence of climate change and Bt acreage to population abundance and
stance in H. zea to Bt corn. It is a novel idea to link the climate change to Bt resistance and
author demonstrated a good skill for data analysis. I have only one concern. It is evident that
temperature increased through time. At the same time, Bt resistance also accumulated
ugh time. So, how to exclude the possibility that the increase of Bt resistance is due to
lution through time? What will happen if the author include time as a predictor? So, I am not
y confident at the conclusion that the temperature anomaly accelerate the Bt resistance
lution.
sponse - We thank the reviewer for their time, and constructive criticism. The
iewer rightfully identifies the temporal trend of resistance accumulation, and Dively et
2016) already demonstrated this. By using time (year) as a predictor, they clearly
ument that during 1996-2016 the rate of increase for the indicators of resistance was
nificantly different between Bt and non-Bt hybrids, with steeper increases for Bt than
n-Bt hybrids over the 21 years (see Figs. 1A–D in Dively et al. 2016).
e reviewer brings up a relevant point about the causality of temperature anomaly for
resistance development. However, resistance development is not just an artefact of
olution over time’ as the evolutionary basis of resistance is driven by environmental
ditions. In the current manuscript we endeavored to analyze the role of key
ironmental factors that also changed over time, and may drive resistance evolution
mely Bt adoption and climatic conditions). We would like to draw to the reviewer’s
ention the clear biological basis of our study (as outlined in the introduction and
kground) and the various mechanisms through which the interaction of temperature
omaly with Bt acreage may accelerate resistance evolution (in the discussion
tion). We acknowledge the correlative/statistical nature of our study and mention the
ed for further research and detailed experiments. We added a sentence to the end of
cussion “While we highlight the statistical association of temperature anomaly and Bt
eage, a complex genetic basis underlies insect resistance to Cry1A Bt toxins in
pidoptera (Heckel et al. 2007).”

ments to the Author:
authors carefully attend to the reviewers' comments in the revised version of the manuscript and in

sponse - For the minor revision, we agree with the associate editor's comments and address
probable concerns of readers on the causality of temperature anomaly for resistance.
We added a sentence in the introduction -
4-107 in minor revision version
ring 1996-2016 the rate of increase for the indicators of resistance was significantly different
ween Bt and non-Bt hybrids with steeper increases for Bt than non-Bt hybrids [see Figs. 1A–
n Dively et al. (25)], clearly demonstrating the temporal trend of resistance accumulation. "
he concluding paragraph now reads
69-276 in minor revision
e evolutionary basis of H. zea resistance to Cry1Ab is driven by environmental conditions
a complex genetic basis underlies insect resistance to Cry1A Bt toxins in Lepidoptera
cies (70). We endeavoured to analyse the role of key environmental factors that also
nged over time, and may drive resistance evolution (namely Bt adoption and climatic
ditions). While we highlight the statistical association of temperature anomaly and Bt
eage, we acknowledge the correlative nature of our study and the need for further research
detailed experiments. Detailed experiments relating toxicity and resistance development at
ied Bt concentrations to temperature conditions are needed to clearly identify the
chanisms through which Bt adoption and climate change interactively influence field-evolved
istance."
