Quigley et al. performed controlled crosses of coral gametes then measured maternal effects on
larval performance. These data provide evidence that maternal effects account for ~20% of
variability in both larval settlement and juvenile survival, while population-specific effects were
not detected. They also analyzed Symbiodinium community structure through next-generation
sequencing of ITS2 amplicons, identifying unique composition patterns among larval families
with with contrasting mortalities.
This is a well-written manuscript with very interesting results. The authors draw important
inferences linking fine-scale cellular and molecular processes (maternal effects on larval
performance and symbiosis establishment) to large scale ecological structuring. This perspective
should prove useful to those forecasting future reef decline and/or recovery, as well help guide
managers making restoration decisions. The authors outline many alternative hypotheses to
explain each aspect of their data, which will certainly guide future research efforts. Pending
some minor revisions outlined below, I recommend the article for publication.
Major Concerns:
Was there any molecular confirmation that the parental colonies collected from the same sites
were in fact genetically distinct? One potential explanation for high mortality among two-parent
crosses is selfing owing to accidentally crossing gametes from ramets of the same genet. Three of
the five families with high mortality were the result of within-population crosses, potentially due
to selfing. I feel the data would be that much more convincing if the confirmation of unique
genets could be provided (eg. through microsatellite genotyping). I suppose if this information
cannot be attained at this stage, the authors might point out that even though O3xO4 failed, and
O3xO5 failed, the cross between O4xO5 was successful (I believe; I can’t find the mortality data
for each family separately, which would be a nice inclusion in the supplement). Thus it seems
unlikely that O3, O4, and O5 were all clones given the differential survival among their crosses.
When exactly (days post-fertilization) were larvae isolated for Symbiodinium characterization? I
couldn’t quite glean this information from the manuscript, and I worry that since some of the
families were experiencing complete mortality, their larvae might have been preserved earlier
than healthy families. If larvae were collected on different days, this might explain some of the
variation in symbiont community, and thus would be important to discuss. Also, while I
certainly like the hypothesis that extra variability in symbiont community among high-mortality
families could be due to a lack of a genetic predisposition for typically beneficial Symbiodinium
(allowing for invasion by other parasitic Symbiodinium), I think it would be worth considering in
the text that this community pattern might be a result rather than a driver of mortality. If the
larvae were already dying for other reasons, their immunity may have been affected, leading to a
dysbiosis. This explanation seems more parsimonious to me than the idea that an adult coral that
has survived to maturity and established its own complement of appropriate symbionts does not
furnish its offspring with this capacity as well. This might also explain why some of the high-
mortality larvae had the same conservative diversity as the low-mortality larvae; the sampling
may have included larvae at different stages of death/dysbiosis. This will be really interesting to
3
look at in the future, but unfortunately with the current data we can’t really distinguish between
these possibilities, so I think both should be mentioned.
All analyses were performed in R. Please consider including the R code as a supplemental file,
along with the original data input files, so that others might reproduce the analysis.
Minor Concerns:
The introduction is nice and concise, but considering how important Symbiodinium are in the
context of this manuscript, they are glossed over a bit. Consider adding a few sentences
describing Symbiodinium effects on larval performance (eg. Suzuki et al., which you already
reference later).
I find it very interesting that despite some Acropora taking years to winnow down to their adult
symbiont complement, here there are already indications of specificity for appropriate symbionts
only a few days post fertilization. I’m not sure any other study has shown such a rapid transition
in species with horizontal acquisition—this would be worth noting. Might such patterns have
been missed before in the absence of next-gen sequencing?
Line 115: On which dates were the Wilkie reef colonies collected? Perhaps I overlooked it, but
please provide the year during which the spawning experiments were performed.
Line 409: I follow where the 4.9% and 23.9% for maternal effects on juvenile survival and
settlement come from, respectively, but I don’t follow how the 17.5% total contribution was
calculated. Can you clarify?
Line 452 & 533: I realize that “uncultured Symbiodinium” is probably the description provided
through NCBI, but I suggest you use a different term, as this falsely implies that the other
Symbiodinium in this study are culturable (many of them are not). Consider something like “a
Symbiodinium type known only from environmental sampling.” It should also be possible to put
this Symbiodinium type in a clade-level context to match with the other OTUs in Figure 5. If it
really can’t be resolved in such a fashion, how certain can we be that it is in fact a Symbiodinium?

Overall
This paper is a nice study of the larvae produced from crosses of Acropora tenuis from two
different populations on the Great Barrier Reef. The selection of two populations is interesting
and novel, and the larval rearing and response variables measured are ecologically relevant and
are standard for larval ecology research. There are no explicit experiments in this study but
instead observational measurements of larval size (dry weight), settlement and post-settlement
survival from multiple crosses. These data are novel and certainly deserve to be published. The
manuscript is wordy in some places and has a limited discussion of the maternal effects
literature. The discussion is also biased to certain ideas that I do not think are supported in the
literature. I am impressed to see that the authors report the raw data in the figures. This rarely
happens in coral larval ecology but the variance is an important parameter that should be
considered more often. Below are specific comments to help broaden the scope of your discussion
and to focus your writing on the data you collected.
1. You have 98 citations, this is a lot, while I personally prefer lots of citations you might consider
reducing this to help streamline your manuscript. I’ve suggested a few more papers to cite below,
I think with careful editing you could replace some of your cited references with more
appropriate ones.
Abstract
2. Line 27 and line 37-38. You focus the discussion in this manuscript on parent genetics.
However, most of the parental effects literature focuses on various aspects of parental “health”.
For instance lipids are important resources for larvae and egg size has been studied for decades
as a parental effect. You mention this briefly in the third paragraph of the introduction, but in
general you have biased your manuscript to genetics. Unfortunately you have no evidence that
genetics is the most important, please consider other factors than just genetics throughout your
manuscript.
Introduction
3. The second paragraph in the introduction is very long. A review has been published
specifically for corals and would greatly reduce the number of citations you have. Ritson-
Williams et al., 2009, New Perspectives on Ecological Mechanisms Affecting Coral Recruitment
on Reefs. Smithsonian Contributions to Marine Science 34: 437-457
Methods
4. Line 180. You say prior to settlement, at 18 days pf. But you counted settlement at 17 days pf.
Did you mean post-settlement? Or does this mean that you collected swimming larvae after
many larvae had already settled? This is unclear. Do you think this might bias your larval weight
estimates, for instance if all the large ones settled, then you are just left with the small swimming
ones to weight. Ideally you would have randomly sampled the larvae, however, I think ones that
had settled before selection for weighing could have biased your results.
Discussion
5. Line 494-495. You never discuss the literature for maternal effects. Instead you attribute
maternal effects to genotype. While studies of maternal effects are quite rare in coral larval
5
ecology (but see: Hartmann et al., (2013) Large birth size does not reduce negative latent effects of
harsh environments across life stages in two coral species. Ecology 94:1966-1976), there is an
extensive literature for other marine invertebrates. Here are some reviews and papers that are
important to consider:
Marshall, Allen, and Crean. (2008). The ecological and evolutionary importance of maternal
effects in the sea. Oceanography and Marine Biology: An annual Review 46:203-250.
Crean, Dwyer and Marshall (2013) Adaptive paternal effects? Experimental evidence that the
paternal environment affects offspring performance. Ecology 94: 2575-2582.
Falkner, Sewell, Byrne (2015) Evolution of maternal provisioning in ophiuroid echinoderms:
characterization of egg composition in planktotrophic and lecithotrophic developers. Marine
Ecology Progress Series 525:1-13.
6. Line 512. You have no evidence that “different symbiotic communities” are a “consequence of
maternal influences”. Since acquisition is horizontal in this species I would argue that is
independent of maternal influences. You could have tested this by seeding the same larval
cultures with different clades of symbiodinium, however by putting your recruits in the field you
have left symbiodinum uptake as a random factor. Indeed the high variability in symbiodinium
communities suggests to me stochastic effects and variable recruitment of symbiodinium to
newly settled juveniles.
7. Line 513-515. You suggest that low mortality families are a consequence of maternal effects.
Why are they not a consequence of symbiodinium community? I don’t see a way for you to
separate these two factors. Again if you had experimentally manipulated which family got which
symbiodinium community you might be able to test for clade by family effects on survival, but
they way you have designed your experiments these are not independent of each other. There is a
nice paper that shows that corals (although adults) with specific symbionts are more capable of
surviving stress than those that associate with a variety of symbionts.
Putnam, Stat, Pochon, Gates (2014) Endosymbiotic flexibility associates with environmental
sensitivity in scleractinian corals. Proc. R Soc. B. doi:10.1098/rspb.2012.1454.
8. Line 525. I can’t find any evidence (in the literature) that symbiodinium uptake is selective.
This paragraph is a nice discussion of the potential impact of uptake of non-prefered symbionts.
Interestingly some GBR corals take up different symbionts as juveniles compared to those they
contain as adults and these authors suggest “natural infection is nonspecific (a potentially
adaptive trait)”. Little, vanOppen and Willis (2004) Flexibility in algal endosymbiosis shapes
growth in reef corals. Science 304: 1492-1494.
9. Line 554-556. I don’t see any evidence for the idea that “maternal identity may influence the
acquisition of the symbiodinium community”. Unfortunately you’re data can not resolve this
questions, see comments above.
10. Line 557. This section is all speculation, be careful to discuss the data you collected. I would
greatly reduce this section. I think this is an interesting discussion but again you bias your
discussion to maternal genotype. However it could also be; energy content in larvae, time in the
plankton before settlement, microhabitat variation where you placed them in the field,
differential predation in the field, epigenetics, etc. I would like to see a more balanced discussion
of other alternative hypotheses.
11. Line 561. There is no evidence that certain juveniles selectively acquire different types of
symbiodinium, however you reinforce this speculation again here. The acquisition of type A3
could also be the abundance in the local environment, but you didn’t measure this so it is
impossible to distinguish this alternate hypothesis.
6
12. Line 576. You are misinterpreting the results of citation #94. Trehalose is secreted by
symbiodinium (not dams) and attracts larvae of Fungia (not symbiodinium). I am a skeptic of this
research as y-mazes are not an ecologically relevant method to test chemoattractants, but if you
are going to cite it make sure you don’t misinterpret their results.
13. Line 579-580. I don’t think you have designed your experiments to test for local adaptation.
You would have to put recruits out in both habitats to fully understand whether certain families
are locally adapted. Since your juveniles were only placed at one site we can assume they
perform the same in the same habitat (a common garden experiment which is what you have),
but you did not test for differential survival among the different populations. You mention this at
the end of this paragraph, but you only discuss temperature. There are probably many other local
features that are different among these habitats, which you could only test by putting juveniles
from each family at both sites. Again this section is a lot of speculation about data that you did
not generate in your experiments.
14. Line 605. A recent paper showed that recent recruits of brooders had higher survival than
broadcast spawners. But you are right I can’t think of any research that teases apart maternal
effects and reproductive mode.
Ritson-Williams, Arnold and Paul (2016). Patterns of larval settlement preferences and post-
settlement survival for seven Caribbean corals. Marine Ecology Progress Series 548:127-138.
15. Line 610. In addition brooded larvae are typically larger than spawned larvae. Again a
maternal effect linked to energy supplies and not related to genetics.
16. You have surprisingly little discussion of larval weight. Do you think size influenced
settlement? I know your methods to measure size were destructive but since you have such a
wide range of larval weights what are the impacts on settlement and survival? Here are some
papers from other marine invertebrates:

they way you have designed your experiments these are not independent of each other. There is a
nice paper that shows that corals (although adults) with specific symbionts are more capable of
surviving stress than those that associate with a variety of symbionts.
Putnam, Stat, Pochon, Gates (2014) Endosymbiotic flexibility associates with environmental
sensitivity in scleractinian corals. Proc. R Soc. B. doi:10.1098/rspb.2012.1454.
8. Line 525. I can’t find any evidence (in the literature) that symbiodinium uptake is selective.
This paragraph is a nice discussion of the potential impact of uptake of non-prefered symbionts.
Interestingly some GBR corals take up different symbionts as juveniles compared to those they
contain as adults and these authors suggest “natural infection is nonspecific (a potentially
adaptive trait)”. Little, vanOppen and Willis (2004) Flexibility in algal endosymbiosis shapes
growth in reef corals. Science 304: 1492-1494.
9. Line 554-556. I don’t see any evidence for the idea that “maternal identity may influence the
acquisition of the symbiodinium community”. Unfortunately you’re data can not resolve this
questions, see comments above.
10. Line 557. This section is all speculation, be careful to discuss the data you collected. I would
greatly reduce this section. I think this is an interesting discussion but again you bias your
discussion to maternal genotype. However it could also be; energy content in larvae, time in the
plankton before settlement, microhabitat variation where you placed them in the field,
differential predation in the field, epigenetics, etc. I would like to see a more balanced discussion
of other alternative hypotheses.
11. Line 561. There is no evidence that certain juveniles selectively acquire different types of
symbiodinium, however you reinforce this speculation again here. The acquisition of type A3
could also be the abundance in the local environment, but you didn’t measure this so it is
impossible to distinguish this alternate hypothesis.
12. Line 576. You are misinterpreting the results of citation #94. Trehalose is secreted by
symbiodinium (not dams) and attracts larvae of Fungia (not symbiodinium). I am a skeptic of this
research as y-mazes are not an ecologically relevant method to test chemoattractants, but if you
are going to cite it make sure you don’t misinterpret their results.
13. Line 579-580. I don’t think you have designed your experiments to test for local adaptation.
You would have to put recruits out in both habitats to fully understand whether certain families
are locally adapted. Since your juveniles were only placed at one site we can assume they
perform the same in the same habitat (a common garden experiment which is what you have),
but you did not test for differential survival among the different populations. You mention this at
the end of this paragraph, but you only discuss temperature. There are probably many other local
features that are different among these habitats, which you could only test by putting juveniles
from each family at both sites. Again this section is a lot of speculation about data that you did
not generate in your experiments.
14. Line 605. A recent paper showed that recent recruits of brooders had higher survival than
broadcast spawners. But you are right I can’t think of any research that teases apart maternal
effects and reproductive mode.
Ritson-Williams, Arnold and Paul (2016). Patterns of larval settlement preferences and post-
settlement survival for seven Caribbean corals. Marine Ecology Progress Series 548:127-138.
13
15. Line 610. In addition brooded larvae are typically larger than spawned larvae. Again a
maternal effect linked to energy supplies and not related to genetics.
16. You have surprisingly little discussion of larval weight. Do you think size influenced
settlement? I know your methods to measure size were destructive but since you have such a
wide range of larval weights what are the impacts on settlement and survival? Here are some
papers from other marine invertebrates:

Dear Drs. Alice Power and Kevin Padian,
Please find uploaded a revised version of “Maternal effects and Symbiodinium
community composition drive differential patterns in juvenile survival in the coral
Acropora tenuis" by Quigley, Willis and Bay in response to the “minor revision”
requested on the 30th of August 2016.
We have responded to all of the reviewers’ comments in detail in the following
document. The manuscript has been substantially improved by clarifying
methodological details and streamlining our conclusions in the discussion as
highlighted by the reviewers, but the substance of the manuscript has not changed.
Importantly, we have substantially reduced our conclusions concerning maternal
genetic effects, and instead limit our conclusions to maternal effects generally, as
suggested by the reviewers. Raw data and statistical analysis in an R script have been
uploaded to Dryad to further support the results presented in the manuscript (RSOS-
160471). Sequencing data has also been submitted to the Sequence Read Archive
(SRA) and we have provided the NCBI accession numbers in the manuscript.
We hope that you will now find our manuscript suitable for publication in the Royal
Society Open Science.
Yours sincerely,
Kate Quigley (On behalf of the co-authors)
Responses to journal and reviewers comments and requirements:
Reviewer # 1:
Major Concerns:
1- Question: Was there any molecular confirmation that the parental colonies
collected from the same sites were in fact genetically distinct? One potential
explanation for high mortality among two-parent crosses is selfing owing to
accidentally crossing gametes from ramets of the same genet. Three of the five
families with high mortality were the result of within-population crosses, potentially
due to selfing. I feel the data would be that much more convincing if the
confirmation of unique genets could be provided (eg. through microsatellite
genotyping). I suppose if this information cannot be attained at this stage, the authors
might point out that even though O3xO4 failed, and O3xO5 failed, the cross between
O4xO5 was successful (I believe; I can’t find the mortality data for each family
separately, which would be a nice inclusion in the supplement). Thus it seems
unlikely that O3, O4, and O5 were all clones given the differential survival among
their crosses.
1- Response:
Line 122 has been added to acknowledge we did not genotype adults: “Colonies
collected were separated by at least 5 m, and given differences in colony colour and
limited success of asexual reproduction in corymbose corals, they were assumed to
represent distinct genotypes.”
A comment has also been added to explain that it is unlikely that O3, O4 and O5
were clones, given successful families from particular combinations of these three
adults.
Line 498: “It is unlikely that families with high mortality died due to genetic
incompatibility between adults (i.e., selfing between clonemates), given patterns of
both very high and very low survivorship found for families resulting from crosses
with colonies from the same population (e.g., O3xO4 and O3xO5 failed, but O4xO5
was successful).”
Percent mortality of each family has also been provided in the raw data on Dryad.
2- Question: a) When exactly (days post-fertilization) were larvae isolated for
Symbiodinium characterization? I couldn’t quite glean this information from the
manuscript, and I worry that since some of the families were experiencing complete
mortality, their larvae might have been preserved earlier than healthy families. If
larvae were collected on different days, this might explain some of the variation in
symbiont community, and thus would be important to discuss.
b) Also, while I certainly like the hypothesis that extra variability in symbiont
community among high-mortality families could be due to a lack of a genetic
predisposition for typically beneficial Symbiodinium (allowing for invasion by other
parasitic Symbiodinium), I think it would be worth considering in the text that this
community pattern might be a result rather than a driver of mortality. If the larvae
were already dying for other reasons, their immunity may have been affected,
leading to a dysbiosis. This explanation seems more parsimonious to me than the
idea that an adult coral that has survived to maturity and established its own
complement of appropriate symbionts does not furnish its offspring with this
capacity as well. This might also explain why some of the high-mortality larvae had
the same conservative diversity as the low-mortality larvae; the sampling may have
included larvae at different stages of death/dysbiosis. This will be really interesting
to look at in the future, but unfortunately with the current data we can’t really
distinguish between these possibilities, so I think both should be mentioned.
2- Response:
a) Symbiodinium uptake occurred at the juvenile stage (i.e., not at the larval stage, as
suggested in the reviewer’s question). All juveniles were placed into the field at
exactly the same time (19 days pf,) and all juveniles were retrieved from the field
(and preserved for isolation of Symbiodinium characterization) at the exact same time
(26 days later = 45 days post-fertilization, Line 179). Therefore, Symbiodinium
communities were characterized for
juveniles that were all exposed to Symbiodinium for exactly the same length of time.
b) This alternative hypothesis has been added to the discussion in two sections:
(Line 537): “Alternatively, differences amongst the Symbiodinium communities
detected here may be the result, rather than the driver, of mortality, with some
unmeasured factor compromising host-symbiont regulation, leading to dysbiosis and
death. Further work is needed to elucidate these alternative explanations, as well as
the fitness benefits and costs of hosting particular symbiont communities.”
(Line 586): “A third possibility is that maternal identity affects juvenile survival
through an unmeasured mechanism that results in dysbiosis of the symbiont
community and juvenile mortality, as discussed above.”
3- Question: All analyses were performed in R. Please consider including the R code
as a supplemental file, along with the original data input files, so that others might
reproduce the analysis.
3- Response: R Statistical analysis and raw data files has been provided through
Dryad under number RSOS-160471.
Minor Concerns:
4- Question: The introduction is nice and concise, but considering how important
Symbiodinium are in the context of this manuscript, they are glossed over a bit.
Consider adding a few sentences describing Symbiodinium effects on larval
performance (eg. Suzuki et al., which you already reference later).
4- Response: The following sentences have been added to the Introduction to
highlight the few studies linking juvenile survival to differences in the diversity and
abundance of Symbiodinium communities.
(Line 66): “The timely and specific acquisition of different clades/types of
Symbiodinium, a key dinoflagellate genus found in corals, has also been linked to
juvenile survival, with clades A and D found in greater proportions in surviving
juveniles of Acropora yongei (Suzuki et al. 2013). A. millepora juveniles also
survived better in low-light treatments when symbiont communities were composed
of roughly equal proportions of C1 and D Symbiodinium, whereas corals with C1-
dominated communities survived better in high-light treatments (Abrego et al.
2012).”
5- Question: I find it very interesting that despite some Acropora taking years to
winnow down to their adult symbiont complement, here there are already indications
of specificity for appropriate symbionts only a few days post fertilization. I’m not
sure any other study has shown such a rapid transition in species with horizontal
acquisition—this would be worth noting. Might such patterns have been missed
before in the absence of next-gen sequencing?
5- Response: The following line was added to the discussion to acknowledge this
point.
(Line 515): “Juvenile families had different symbiont communities after less than
one month of field deployment and exposure to Symbiodinium, representing the
earliest record of symbiont specificity in a coral species with horizontal transmission
yet reported, potentially due to the deep sequencing approached utilized.”
6- Question: Line 115: On which dates were the Wilkie reef colonies collected?
Perhaps I overlooked it, but please provide the year during which the spawning
experiments were performed.
6- Response: Wilkie colonies were collected at the end of October, 22 days prior to
spawning. The month and year has been added to the text for both population
collection sites.
(Lines 115) “For inter- and intra-population crosses, 14 reproductively mature
colonies of Acropora tenuis were collected at the end of October 2013 from Wilkie
Reef (13°46’44.544”S, 143°38’26.0154”E) in Princess Charlotte Bay in the far
northern sector of the Great Barrier Reef. Corals were transported by boat to Orpheus
Island Research Station (OIRS) and acclimated in outdoor holding tanks for 22 days
under constant flow-through conditions. Ten colonies of A. tenuis were collected
from South Orpheus on the 19 th and 20th of November 2013 (18°39’49.62”S,
146°29’47.26’E) and housed at OIRS under the same flow-through conditions for
one-two days prior to spawning.”
7- Question: Line 409: I follow where the 4.9% and 23.9% for maternal effects on
juvenile survival and settlement come from, respectively, but I don’t follow how the
17.5% total contribution was calculated. Can you clarify?
7- Response: Clarification has been added to the Results section that outlines the
summation of all the contributed maternal effects on juvenile survival.
(Lines 412) “With the direct maternal effects on juvenile survival (4.9%) in addition
to the carry-on indirect maternal effects on juvenile survival through settlement
(23.9% of 53% = 12.6%), the total maternal contribution to juvenile survivorship
was 17.5% (the sum of 4.9% and 12.6%).”
8- Question: a) Line 452 & 533: I realize that “uncultured Symbiodinium” is
probably the description provided through NCBI, but I suggest you use a different
term, as this falsely implies that the other Symbiodinium in this study are culturable
(many of them are not). Consider something like “a Symbiodinium type known only
from environmental sampling.” b) It should also be possible to put this
Symbiodinium type in a clade-level context to match with the other OTUs in Figure
5. If it really can’t be resolved in such a fashion, how certain can we be that it is in
fact a Symbiodinium?
8- Response: a) The NCBI use of “uncultured” has been changed to:
(Lines 284, Figure 5): “Symbiodinium identified from environmental sampling”
(abbreviated to “environmental” or “environmental Symbiodinium”)”.
b) The accession number to this blast hit “uncultured Symbiodinium OTU 19”
originated from the publication: Sweet 2013 Symbiodinium diversity within
Acropora muricata and the surrounding environment. Marine Ecology doi:
10.1111/maec.12092. It was given Accession number JN406302, which the authors
of this paper identity as a 100% match (E-value 0.0) to Accession GU362429, with
the deepest taxonomic classification to clade E Symbiodinium and retrieved through
water column sampling. We therefore changed the name from “Uncultured
Symbiodinium OTU 19” to clade E Symbiodinium. (Lines 295, 456, and 555, Figure
5)
Reviewer # 2:
1- Question: You have 98 citations, this is a lot, while I personally prefer lots of
citations you might consider reducing this to help streamline your manuscript. I’ve
suggested a few more papers to cite below, I think with careful editing you could
replace some of your cited references with more appropriate ones.
1- Response: We have removed a total of 13 references from the Introduction and
the Discussion. Please see the list of removed citations in response to question 3
below. Whilst we removed 17 from this section alone, other citations were added as
requested by the reviewer, resulting in a total of 86 citations.
Abstract
2- Question: 2. Line 27 and line 37-38. You focus the discussion in this manuscript
on parent genetics. However, most of the parental effects literature focuses on
various aspects of parental “health”. For instance lipids are important resources for
larvae and egg size has been studied for decades as a parental effect. You mention
this briefly in the third paragraph of the introduction, but in general you have biased
your manuscript to genetics. Unfortunately you have no evidence that genetics is the
most important, please consider other factors than just genetics throughout your
manuscript.
2- Response: We have made a number of changes throughout the manuscript to
provide a more balanced discussion of parental effects on juvenile survival (detailed
below). We have also changed “genotype” to “identity” or “maternal/familial
effects” (indicated in italics below for ease of locating terms substituted), as follows:
Line 24: “Coral endosymbionts in the dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium are known
to impact host physiology and have led to the evolution of reef-building, but less is
known about how symbiotic communities in early life history stages and their
interactions with host parental identity shape the structure of coral communities on
reefs.”
Line 31: “We show that maternal effects (that here include genetic and/or effects
related to the maternal environment) can explain nearly 24% of variation in larval
settlement success and 5-17% of variation in juvenile survival in an experimental
study of the reef-building scleractinian coral, Acropora tenuis.”
Line 105: “To further current understanding of the extent to which parental identities
drive variation in larval survival, larval settlement and juvenile survival, this study
quantified parental effects on key early life-history stages in the broadcasting coral
Acropora tenuis. Using larvae from intra- and inter-population crosses, we determine
the impacts of parental identity on larval survival, weight and settlement, and on
juvenile survival in the field.”
Line 502: “These findings suggest that some aspect(s) of maternal identity, either at
an environmental or genetic level, directly influences the fitness of early life history
stages, predisposing juveniles to either live or die.”
Line 506: “The maternal effects on larval settlement and juvenile survival
demonstrated here provide evidence that differences in colony identity may scale up
through differential survival of early life history stages and contribute significantly to
shaping heterogeneous reef communities.”
Line 519: “Microbes (both bacterial and eukaryotic) are known to heavily impact
coral development and health [66–69], but few studies to date investigate the links
between parental identity (maternal or paternal effects) and Symbiodinium
assemblage acquired by juveniles with horizontal symbiont transmission.”
Line 514: “The Symbiodinium community acquired by juveniles of broadcast-
spawning corals offers a potential link between maternal effects and juvenile
survivorship.”
Line 643: “We show that maternal identity impacts multiple early-life stages of the
broadcast-spawning coral Acropora tenuis.”
Mention of “the provisioning of genetic architecture” has been removed and the
sentence has been edited to the following:
Line 37: “Our results highlight that maternal and familial effects significantly
explain variation in juvenile survival and symbiont communities in a broadcast-
spawning coral, with Symbiodinium type A3 possibly a critical symbiotic partner
during this early life-stage.”
Line 638: “These results suggest that the magnitude of parental effects may be tied to
modes of reproduction and symbiont transmission, highlighting crucial but
understudied links between parental identity, Symbiodinium community composition
and local adaptation.”
3- Question: The second paragraph in the introduction is very long. A review has
been published specifically for corals and would greatly reduce the number of
citations you have. Ritson-Williams et al., 2009, New Perspectives on Ecological
Mechanisms Affecting Coral Recruitment on Reefs. Smithsonian Contributions to
Marine Science 34: 437-457
3- Response: This paragraph has been reduced from ten sentences to six to reduce its
length and clarify the point of the paragraph (Lines 61-66).
17 citations were removed and replaced with the Ritson-Williams et al. 2009 review
(Citations removed from this paragraph: Graham et al. 2008; 2013; Babcock and
Heyward; Birrell et al. 2005, 2008; Babcock 1985; Wilson and Harrison 2005; Box
and Mumby 2007; Hughes et al. 2007; Vermeij and Sandin 2008; Vermeij et al.
2009; Babcock and Mundy 1996; Trapon et al. 2013a; Davies et al. 2013;Vigliola et
al. 2007; van Oppen et al. 2014; Webster et al. 2015).
I also edited what was previously four sentences into a single sentence:
Lines 61-66: “Once metamorphosed, many factors influence juvenile abundances
and species composition of coral assemblages, including abiotic (e.g., environmental
conditions and storms: [11,12]) and biotic factors (e.g., parental reproductive mode:
[8]; accidental predation by herbivorous fish: [13,14]; juvenile growth and intra/inter
species competition [15]).”
Methods
4- Question: Line 180. You say prior to settlement, at 18 days pf. But you counted
settlement at 17 days pf. Did you mean post-settlement? Or does this mean that you
collected swimming larvae after many larvae had already settled? This is unclear. Do
you think this might bias your larval weight estimates, for instance if all the large
ones settled, then you are just left with the small swimming ones to weight. Ideally
you would have randomly sampled the larvae, however, I think ones that had settled
before selection for weighing could have biased your results.
4- Response: Yes, this phrasing was unclear. What we meant was that swimming
larvae were collected after many larvae had already settled. Therefore, if larvae from
a specific weight class were to settle first, then the mean larval weight for each
family would deviate from the overall mean larval weight, compared to if we had
collected larvae on the first day of settlement competency (6 d.p.f.). However, there
is no evidence to suggest that larvae in heavier or lighter weight classes settle first.
Moreover, we were primarily interested in comparing mean larval weights among
families, which remains a valid comparison as all larvae were collected on the same
day pf.
The phrasing “prior to settlement” has been removed and the following sentence has
been added to acknowledge potential bias associated with this approach.
Line 190: “Although collecting larvae 12 days after settling had commenced may
have biased calculations of mean larval weights (e.g., larvae from a specific weight
class might have settled first and become unavailable for collection), this issue would
have been common to all families. Therefore any potential bias in calculating mean
larval dry weight per family because of sampling time would not have affected
comparisons among families.”
Discussion
5- Question: Line 494-495. You never discuss the literature for maternal effects.
Instead you attribute maternal effects to genotype. While studies of maternal effects
are quite rare in coral larval ecology (but see: Hartmann et al., (2013) Large birth
size does not reduce negative latent effects of harsh environments across life stages
in two coral species. Ecology 94:1966-1976), there is an extensive literature for other
marine invertebrates. Here are some reviews and papers that are important to
consider:
Marshall, Allen, and Crean. (2008). The ecological and evolutionary importance of
maternal effects in the sea. Oceanography and Marine Biology: An annual Review
46:203-250.
Crean, Dwyer and Marshall (2013) Adaptive paternal effects? Experimental evidence
that the paternal environment affects offspring performance. Ecology 94: 2575-2582.
Falkner, Sewell, Byrne (2015) Evolution of maternal provisioning in ophiuroid
echinoderms: characterization of egg composition in planktotrophic and
lecithotrophic developers. Marine Ecology Progress Series 525:1-13.
5- Response: In conjunction with the paragraph on non-genetic maternal effects in
the Introduction (Lines 76-89; see comment above), we have expanded the
discussion of non-genetic maternal effects in the discussion as follows:
(Lines 576-590): “The maternal effects detected here may have several underlying
mechanisms that can be environmental and genetic [77]. Maternal environmental
effects may be caused by differences in energy provision (lipid) provided to larvae,
variations in egg or sperm quality due to colony age, or through epigenetic effects
[reviewed in: 15,78]. Another potential mechanism is genetic maternal effects
through heritability of maternal genes that influence the development of an
appropriate immune system in coral juveniles. Cell to cell recognition and
phagocytosis have been hypothesized as key precursors to the establishment and
maintenance of symbiosis with Symbiodinium [79] and may underpin maternal
genetic effects through the transmission of genes that regulate a repertoire of
immune-related, cell-surface proteins adapted for certain environmental conditions,
and/or symbiont types. A third possibility is that maternal identity affects juvenile
survival through an unmeasured mechanism that results in dysbiosis of the symbiont
community and juvenile mortality, as discussed above. These findings demonstrate
that further research is needed to identify mechanisms underlying these maternal and
familial effects in juveniles.”
6- Question: Line 512. You have no evidence that “different symbiotic
communities” are a “consequence of maternal influences”. Since acquisition is
horizontal in this species I would argue that is independent of maternal influences.
You could have tested this by seeding the same larval cultures with different clades
of symbiodinium, however by putting your recruits in the field you have left
symbiodinum uptake as a random factor. Indeed the high variability in symbiodinium
communities suggests to me stochastic effects and variable recruitment of
symbiodinium to newly settled juveniles.
6- Response: We respectfully disagree with the reviewer on this point. The reviewer
rightfully points out that Symbiodinium uptake was not experimentally controlled as
it was based on environmental uptake in the field. However, we only found high
variability in Symbiodinium communities in juveniles of low-surviving families.
Symbiodinium diversity was consistent among juveniles of high surviving families.
Variability in Symbiodinium diversity was significantly explained by juvenile
mortality and juvenile family identity (Permutational multivariate analysis of
variance; by family: R2=0.21, df=6, p = 0.001; by mortality: R2=0.18, df=1, p =
0.001, Line 445). These results point toward non-random patterns in Symbiodinium
uptake in juveniles. These results could be driven by both maternal genetic and non-
genetic effects. This sentence has been modified and we follow with a discussion of
the potential mechanisms by which maternal identity can affect juvenile
survivorship.
Lines 522: “Our results identify a potential link between maternal identity and the
juvenile Symbiodinium community that may have an environmental or genetic basis,
and propose that an inherited or transmitted mechanism, whose expression differs
across dams, leads to differential formation of Symbiodinium communities among
families and contributes to differences in juvenile survival.”
7- Question: Line 513-515. You suggest that low mortality families are a
consequence of maternal effects. Why are they not a consequence of symbiodinium
community? I don’t see a way for you to separate these two factors. Again if you had
experimentally manipulated which family got which symbiodinium community you
might be able to test for clade by family effects on survival, but they way you have
designed your experiments these are not independent of each other. There is a nice
paper that shows that corals (although adults) with specific symbionts are more
capable of surviving stress than those that associate with a variety of symbionts.
Putnam, Stat, Pochon, Gates (2014) Endosymbiotic flexibility associates with
environmental sensitivity in scleractinian corals. Proc. R Soc. B.
doi:10.1098/rspb.2012.1454.
7- Response: Indeed, we did find a significant effect of maternal identity on juvenile
survival (4.9% directly, for a total of 17.5% when combined with carry-on effects
from settlement) (Generalized Linear Mixed Models, Line 414). When this result is
combined with evidence that Symbiodinium communities differed significantly
between high and low mortality families and by family in general (Permutational
multivariate analysis of variance; by family: R 2=0.21, df=6, p = 0.001; by mortality:
R2=0.18, df=1, p = 0.001)(Line 445), we link all three factors (maternal identity,
juvenile Symbiodinium community and juvenile mortality) together. We agree that
low mortality could be a consequence of the Symbiodinium community, and also
argue that differences in the Symbiodinium community are due to maternal genetic
effects. From our study, we can’t definitively untangle the hierarchy of causation
among these three factors. However, if random differential uptake of the
Symbiodinium community was driving patterns in high and low mortality
independent of family/dam identity, we wouldn’t see significant differences in
community composition among families or dams (which we do). The data would
show juveniles surviving randomly across multiple families and multiple dams. In
contrast, we see consistent patterns of high- and low-surviving families associated
with specific dams, regardless of the number of juveniles per dam/family.
To make the relationship among these three factors clearer, the sentence in question
(“Our data show that juveniles of high and low mortality families had different
symbiotic communities, potentially as a consequence of maternal influences.”) has
been amended to the following:
(Lines 522): “Our results identify a potential link between maternal identity and the
juvenile Symbiodinium community that may have an environmental or genetic basis,
and propose that an inherited or transmitted mechanism, whose expression differs
across dams, leads to differential formation of Symbiodinium communities among
families and contributes to differences in juvenile survival.”
The Putnam paper suggested adds further evidence supporting our argument that
certain communities of microbes (i.e. Symbiodinium) impact coral health and has
been referenced in Line 519. “Microbes (both bacterial and eukaryotic) are known to
heavily impact coral development and health (e.g., Putnam et al. 2016)…”
8- Question: Line 525. I can’t find any evidence (in the literature) that
symbiodinium uptake is selective. This paragraph is a nice discussion of the potential
impact of uptake of non-prefered symbionts. Interestingly some GBR corals take up
different symbionts as juveniles compared to those they contain as adults and these
authors suggest “natural infection is nonspecific (a potentially adaptive trait)”. Little,
vanOppen and Willis (2004) Flexibility in algal endosymbiosis shapes growth in reef
corals. Science 304: 1492-1494.
8- Response: There is evidence that uptake can be either selective or promiscuous,
which is now clarified in the text:
(Line 542): “It is currently unclear whether Symbiodinium uptake in early life-stages
of corals is specific [16] or random [70], however our results suggest that the high
mortality experienced by certain juvenile families may be due to either the specific
absence of A3 or to the non-specific uptake of a community that becomes
detrimental for the juvenile coral host [71].”
9- Question: Line 554-556. I don’t see any evidence for the idea that “maternal
identity may influence the acquisition of the symbiodinium community”.
Unfortunately you’re data can not resolve this questions, see comments above.
9- Response: The results presented here show that maternal identity, juvenile
Symbiodinium community composition, and juvenile survivorship are all linked
(statistics cited in our response to question 7). However, it is correct that these data
can’t resolve influences on the mechanism of symbiont acquisition. “Acquisition”
has been changed to “composition”.
(Line 570): “Evidence that maternal effects influence juvenile survival, combined
with the fact that low mortality families had conserved Symbiodinium assemblages,
provide a potential link between maternal identity and the composition of the
Symbiodinium communities associated with juvenile corals, with some dams able to
provide their offspring with mechanisms to select for beneficial communities (or
exclude non-beneficial ones) whilst others do not.”
10- Question: Line 557. This section is all speculation, be careful to discuss the data
you collected. I would greatly reduce this section. I think this is an interesting
discussion but again you bias your discussion to maternal genotype. However it
could also be; energy content in larvae, time in the plankton before settlement,
microhabitat variation where you placed them in the field, differential predation in
the field, epigenetics, etc. I would like to see a more balanced discussion of other
alternative hypotheses.
10- Response: This section has been reduced and new hypotheses representing
alternative theories to maternal genotype have been discussed, as suggested.
Lines 576-589: “The maternal effects detected here may have several underlying
mechanisms that can be environmental and genetic [77]. Maternal environmental
effects may be caused by differences in energy provision (lipid) provided to larvae,
variations in egg or sperm quality due to colony age, or through epigenetic effects
[reviewed in: 15,78]. Another potential mechanism is genetic maternal effects
through heritability of maternal genes that influence the development of an
appropriate immune system in coral juveniles. Cell to cell recognition and
phagocytosis have been hypothesized as key precursors to the establishment and
maintenance of symbiosis with Symbiodinium [79] and may underpin maternal
genetic effects through the transmission of genes that regulate a repertoire of
immune-related, cell-surface proteins adapted for certain environmental conditions,
and/or symbiont types. A third possibility is that maternal identity affects juvenile
survival through an unmeasured mechanism that results in dysbiosis of the symbiont
community and juvenile mortality, as discussed above. These findings demonstrate
that further research is needed to identify mechanisms underlying these maternal and
familial effects in juveniles.”
11- Question: Line 561. There is no evidence that certain juveniles selectively
acquire different types of symbiodinium, however you reinforce this speculation
again here. The acquisition of type A3 could also be the abundance in the local
environment, but you didn’t measure this so it is impossible to distinguish this
alternate hypothesis.
11- Response:
We agree that we do not have evidence to support selective acquisition, only the
presence of Symbiodinium after one month. This phrase has been removed.
12- Question: Line 576. You are misinterpreting the results of citation #94.
Trehalose is secreted by symbiodinium (not dams) and attracts larvae of Fungia (not
symbiodinium). I am a skeptic of this research as y-mazes are not an ecologically
relevant method to test chemoattractants, but if you are going to cite it make sure you
don’t misinterpret their results.
12- Response: This was a tangential comment that was incorrectly interpreted and
has been removed.
13- Question: Line 579-580. I don’t think you have designed your experiments to
test for local adaptation. You would have to put recruits out in both habitats to fully
understand whether certain families are locally adapted. Since your juveniles were
only placed at one site we can assume they perform the same in the same habitat (a
common garden experiment which is what you have), but you did not test for
differential survival among the different populations. You mention this at the end of
this paragraph, but you only discuss temperature. There are probably many other
local features that are different among these habitats, which you could only test by
putting juveniles from each family at both sites. Again this section is a lot of
speculation about data that you did not generate in your experiments.
13- Response: We agree. We did not complete a full reciprocal transplant design,
only placing juveniles at one location in the field, therefore we cannot state
definitively whether or not juveniles are locally adapted. If Orpheus juveniles placed
in Orpheus environment are locally adapted, we would expect to see: OO, and maybe
OW having significantly less mortality than WW and WO. If Wilkie juveniles were
locally adapted to Wilkie environment, we would expect to see: WW and WO having
significantly greater mortality than OO and OW. What we see is this: “Percent
mortality of juveniles after 25 days in the field was not significantly described by
lineage purity (KW: <U+03C7>21 = 0.1, p = 0.73) or population cross (KW: <U+03C7> 23 = 2.5, p =
0.47)” (Line 363)
To acknowledge the lack of a reciprocal transplant design, the following has been
added to the discussion:
(Line 592): “Whilst definitive statements about local adaptation of the northern and
central GBR populations are not possible because juveniles were not reciprocally
transplanted between the two locations, we present preliminary evidence for the lack
of a significant effect of either lineage purity or population cross on percent mortality
of juveniles. Our results suggest that there was no fitness benefit associated with
outplanting on their natal reef for Orpheus juveniles (either OO or OW), and no
fitness cost associated with a non-natal grow-out location for Wilkie juveniles (either
WW or WO).”
The following change has also been made to acknowledge that factors other than
temperature can drive differences between these two sites:
(Line 615): “Whilst other environmental factors may be equally or more important
than temperature (e.g., turbidity, nutrients, currents), annual temperatures at Orpheus,
where the juveniles were raised, are lower than those at Wilkie (Dixon et al. 2015),
therefore all juveniles were exposed to temperatures within their normal thermal
ranges.”
14- Question: Line 605. A recent paper showed that recent recruits of brooders had
higher survival than broadcast spawners. But you are right I can’t think of any
research that teases apart maternal effects and reproductive mode.
Ritson-Williams, Arnold and Paul (2016). Patterns of larval settlement preferences
and post-settlement survival for seven Caribbean corals. Marine Ecology Progress
Series 548:127-138.
14- Response: This statement was missing a citation. The citation provided has been
added so that it now reads:
(Line 624): “Reproductive mode is commonly assumed to be an important factor
when assessing juvenile mortality risk (Ritson-Williams et al. 2016), but empirical
comparisons of maternal influences on the survival of juveniles originating from
these two reproductive modes are lacking.”
15- Question: Line 610. In addition brooded larvae are typically larger than spawned
larvae. Again a maternal effect linked to energy supplies and not related to genetics.
15- Response: This is an important point that has now been added, so this sentence
now reads:
(Line 630): “For example, brooded larvae 1) are exposed to the maternal
environment, 2) are typically larger than larvae developed from spawned gametes, 3)
acquire maternally-derived symbionts, and 4) are almost immediately competent to
settle, leading to typically shorter dispersal distances from maternal colonies.”
16- Question: You have surprisingly little discussion of larval weight. Do you think
size influenced settlement? I know your methods to measure size were destructive
but since you have such a wide range of larval weights what are the impacts on
settlement and survival? Here are some papers from other marine invertebrates:
Marshall and Keough (2008) The relationship between offspring size and
performance in the sea. American Naturalist 171:214-224.
Marshall and Keough (2008) The evolutionary ecology of offspring size in marine
invertebrates. Advances in Marine Biology 53.
Moran and McAlister (2009). Egg size as a life history character of marine
invertebrates: is it all it’s cracked up to be? Biological Bulletin 216:226-242.
Ruis, Turon, Dias, Marshall (2010). Propagule size effects across multiple life-
history stages in a marine invertebrate. Functional Ecology 24:685-693.
16- Response: Juvenile survival was not well correlated with larval weight:
R2=0.201-0.328 with either the inclusion of larvae from all families or only including
larvae from families that made it past the settlement stage. Both analyses and results
are provided: Line 440, Supplementary Fig. 1). Larval settlement success also
appeared unrelated to larval weight (Figure 2, panels a and c). As these results
provided little evidence for an effect of larval weight on either settlement or survival,
we limited our discussion to factors that did, namely maternal and familial identity.

Figures
18- Question: Figures 1 and 2. I would recommend moving the n out of the legend
and placing it right on the figure. Right now the legend is difficult to read, and there
is space for this right on your figure.
18- Response: The sample sizes have been removed from the figure legends and
added directly into both figures, as suggested.
19- Question: Figure 3. You provide an asterisk for dam W11, but the p-value is
0.076. This is not significant. If you want to change your alpha to greater than 0.05
you could explain that in the methods, however in science we have chosen 0.05 as
our cutoff value, there is no such
thing as marginally significant, and you certainly shouldn’t indicate significance for
a value that is not significant.
19- Response: The asterisk for dam W11 in Figure 3 has been removed.
