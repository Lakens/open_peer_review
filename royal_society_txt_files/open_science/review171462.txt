In this study, authors Chen et al. develop a model of the calcium release site which contains
clustered and rogue RyRs and apply it to explain features of calcium quarks and their relation to
calcium sparks. The model reproduces experimental recordings pertaining to the features of a
rogue RyR induced full calcium spark, demonstrates three independent modes of quark/sparks
and shows the dependence on luminal Ca concentration. The study is well conducted and
presented, and the agreement between experiment and simulation is encouraging, but never-the-
less does have some issues which must be addressed.

Major comments:
1. Whereas some novel insight is offered pertaining to the dynamics of calcium quark/sparks, the
authors fail to put their results into the context of the work from numerous other groups, and in
particular fail to clearly highlight the novelty of their study compared to some of these other,
significantly more substantial studies. Many are mentioned in the introduction (with a few
omissions including a pertinent paper from a group already cited – Walker et al 2015 “On the
Adjacency Matrix of RyR2 cluster structures”) but are then not revisited in the context of the
results in the present study.
2. The limitations section is significantly lacking, stating only one rather trivial limitation without
reference to its potential importance (this reviewer agrees that extension to 3D is natural, but
given the agreement between model and experiment, is that the most significant limitation?).
3. I would like the authors to reconsider their use of the terminology “calcium release unit
(CRU)”. Whereas there is no formal general consensus as to the use of this term, it tends to be
used to refer to the whole system surrounding a calcium release site junctional space, rather than
to single RyRs (or a rouge RyR vs a cluster?) as in the present study. This 1) could offer
opportunity for confusion and, more importantly 2) is unnecessary and cumbersome to use CRU
to refer to a single RyR. It is also common to refer to an RyR cluster as a CRU, even if there are
multiple CRUs per junctional space, and this is perfectly acceptable as used in the present study,
but reference to single, rogue RyRs as CRUs is really rather cumbersome:
For example, the sentence “.. due to an opening CRU of clustered RyRs initiated by three opening
CRUs of rogue RyRs.” would read better “.. due to opening of the clustered RyRs initiated by the
opening of three rogue RyRs” or “.. due to an opening CRU of clustered RyRs initiated by three
opening rogue RyRs.”
And again: “CRUs of clustered RyRs (blue dots, ~2 CRUs in a JSR) are surrounded by randomly
distributed CRUs of rogue RyRs” <U+2192> ““CRUs of clustered RyRs (blue dots, ~2 CRUs in a JSR) are
surrounded by randomly distributed rogue RyRs”
There are numerous uses of this term which should be addressed as above.
4. The linescan images in figure 6 would be improved by rescaling of the colour scale to more
clearly show the data, as it appears the higher ranges on the colour scale barely appear in the
data.
Minor comments and text corrections
1. Please clarify that “rogue RyRs” is also used to refer to non-junctional RyRs in other studies
(such as in Lu, Xia, Ye and Cheng 2010; Lu, Xia and Zhu 2012, both of which should also be cited
in the introduction) and ensure it is clarified that the terminology in this study refers to non-
clustered RyRs within a single junctional space, to avoid confusion of interpretation.
2. Please define “anomalous subdiffusion order”
3. Where does the number 0.64 in equations 2.8,9 come from?
4. A schematic of the whole system (with the lumen) would help readers unfamiliar with these
model structures
5. The size of the mesh of 5µm x 5µm seems an odd choice for the simulation of a single junction
given that this is larger than spacing between sites. Can the authors please justify this choice?
4
6. There is repeated use of two abbreviations – QCR, QCD, without clear definition.
7. Pg 4 ln 12 “..with considering the distribution..“ should be “consideration for”
If these issues are addressed, I would recommend this study for publication.

mentioned in the introduction (with a few omissions including a pertinent paper from a
group already cited – Walker et al 2015 “On the Adjacency Matrix of RyR2 cluster
structures”) but are then not revisited in the context of the results in the present study.
Response: We revised the section “INTRODUCTION” as well as added a subsection
“A comparison with previous models” to show the difference between the study and
works from other groups (Walker, Williams, Kohl et al. 2014; Walker, Kohl, Lehnart et
al. 2015; Lu, Xia, Ye et al. 2010; Lu, Xia, Zhu. 2012; and Sato and Bers 2011; i.e., Refs.
14-18). This study focuses on the temporal and spatial properties of Ca2+ quarks and
sparks relevant to both rogue and clustered RyRs, where rogue RyRs randomly
surround clustered RyRs within a single junctional space (i.e., junctional rogue RyRs).
There is good agreement between computational and experimental results. Please see
the below revisions.
Changes to Ms. (page 3, line 12)
“Zima et al. demonstrated experimentally that single RyR opening could mediate Ca2+
leak but fail to trigger Ca2+ sparks when free Ca2+ concentration in the JSR lumen
([Ca2+]lumen) is below a threshold level [11]. On the other hand, mathematical models
have been developed to investigate the dynamics of Ca2+ sparks and quarks. Sobie et al.
proposed a model to solve the paradox of [Ca2+]lumen to support the existence of rogue
RyRs [12]. Models of Ca2+ leak from JSRs have been used to characterize differences
between Ca2+ sparks and quarks [13]. Walker et al. included the computational
nonspark-based Ca2+ leak from JSRs to explain the exponential rise of Ca2+ spark
frequency [14]. They further presented that Ca2+ sparks could be triggered by
spontaneous opening of a single RyR in a cluster [15]. A stochastic contact network
model of the Ca2+ initiation process was applied to realistic RyR cluster structures,
which revealed that the Ca2+ sparks probability depends on the position of the initial
RyR in the cluster. Their works provided insight into the Ca2+ release process in the
heart and a framework for evaluating functional heterogeneity in populations of
receptor clusters under normal and pathological conditions. Lu et al. investigated “non-
junctional rogue RyRs” located away from the release sites and showed their effects on
Ca2+ waves with heart failure [16, 17]. It suggested that Ca2+ dynamics was unstable
and Ca2+ waves were likely to be triggered when “non-junctional rogue RyRs” were
taken into consideration. The variation of membrane potential depolarization was
indicated to be dependent on the distribution density of rogue RyR channels, which is
important for understanding arrhythmogenic mechanism for heart failure from
subcellular to cellular level. Sato and Bers used a mathematical model of JSR Ca2+
releases to show that single RyR opening at low [Ca2+]lumen could not recruit Ca2+ sparks
from Ca2+ release units (CRUs) [18]. However, the effects of rogue RyRs on Ca2+ sparks
at high [Ca2+]lumen remain unknown. The anomalous subdiffusion of cytoplasmic Ca2+
and the random distribution of JSR RyRs, unnoticed in these models, could unveil the
temporal and spatial properties of Ca2+ sparks and quarks. ”
Changes to Ms. (page 13, line 25)
“3.5 A comparison with previous models
Sato et al. showed that a RyR channel in a cluster of RyRs could trigger adjacent RyR
channels in the same cluster to form a Ca2+ spark when [Ca2+]lumen is above a threshold
[18]. Walker et al. further investigated the structural effects of clustered RyRs on Ca2+
sparks [14,15]. Moreover, Lu et al. indicted that non-junctional RyRs increased the
probability of occurrence of spontaneous Ca2+ waves [16,17]. The present study showed
the temporal and spatial properties of Ca2+ quarks and sparks relevant to both rogue and
clustered RyRs, where rogue RyRs randomly surround clustered RyRs within a single
junctional space. We showed that Ca2+ quarks and sparks coexist at a Ca2+ release site,
which agrees with experimental measurements from line-scan imaging. The opening of
rogue RyRs leads to the formation of Ca2+ sparks at high [Ca2+]lumen, but not at low
[Ca2+]lumen. This supports the conclusion of Sato et al. [18].
On the other hand, the present model simulated Ca2+ quarks and sparks based on
the anomalous subdiffusion in comparison with previous models from Fickian diffusion
[14-18]. Hence, we solved the paradox of full width at half-maximum (FWHM) due to
Fickian diffusion. This study addresses the importance of rogue RyRs for understanding
Ca2+ release mechanisms from JSRs.”
2. The limitations section is significantly lacking, stating only one rather trivial
limitation without reference to its potential importance (this reviewer agrees that
extension to 3D is natural, but given the agreement between model and experiment, is
that the most significant limitation?).
Response: We have revised the section “Critique of the study” as suggested. Please see
the below revisions. Thank you.
Changes to Ms. (page 15, line 4)
“3.7 Critique of the study
In the study, the duration and current of Ca2+ release events from JSRs were fixed
similar to previous studies [10, 27]. However, Ca2+ release flux should be regulated by
the SR structure, functional properties and the size of RyR cluster [41]. The impact of
time-dependent Ca2+ release flux from RyRs can give us new inspiration for the relation
between Ca2+ release events and the interplay of rogue and clustered RyRs. The spatial
arrangement of RyRs within clusters influences the frequency of Ca2+ sparks [14]. The
detailed structure of clustered RyRs should be taken into consideration when a high-
performance supercomputer is used to satisfy the requirement of large computation.
Furthermore, the present study comes from the assumption that 3D geometry was
simplified to a 2D model in healthy myocytes. Modeling 3D distribution of the JSRs in
cardiac cells is more realistic and Izu et al.’s 3D simulations indicated that it could
reveal more complex RyR interactions between neighbor JSRs [42]. Hence, a 3D model
should be developed to investigate spontaneous Ca2+ release events under both
physiological and pathological conditions in future studies. ”
3. I would like the authors to reconsider their use of the terminology “calcium release
unit (CRU)”. Whereas there is no formal general consensus as to the use of this term,
it tends to be used to refer to the whole system surrounding a calcium release site
junctional space, rather than to single RyRs (or a rouge RyR vs a cluster?) as in the
present study. This 1) could offer opportunity for confusion and, more importantly 2) is
unnecessary and cumbersome to use CRU to refer to a single RyR. It is also common
to refer to an RyR cluster as a CRU, even if there are multiple CRUs per junctional
space, and this is perfectly acceptable as used in the present study, but reference to
single, rogue RyRs as CRUs is really rather cumbersome:
For example, the sentence “.. due to an opening CRU of clustered RyRs initiated by
three opening CRUs of rogue RyRs.” would read better “.. due to opening of the
clustered RyRs initiated by the opening of three rogue RyRs” or “.. due to an opening
CRU of clustered RyRs initiated by three opening rogue RyRs.”
And again: “CRUs of clustered RyRs (blue dots, ~2 CRUs in a JSR) are surrounded by
randomly distributed CRUs of rogue RyRs” <U+2192> ““CRUs of clustered RyRs (blue dots,
~2 CRUs in a JSR) are surrounded by randomly distributed rogue RyRs”
There are numerous uses of this term which should be addressed as above.
Response: We revised it as suggested.
Changes to Ms. (page 2, line 6)
“Ca2+ quarks and sparks from the stochastic opening of rogue and clustered RyRs are
numerically reproduced and agree with experimental measurements. It is found that the
stochastic opening Ca2+ release units (CRUs) of clustered RyRs are regulated by free
Ca2+ concentration in the JSR lumen (i.e., [Ca2+]lumen).”
Changes to Ms. (page 4, line 23)
“The stochastic opening of rogue and clustered RyRs were regulated by free Ca2+
concentrations in both cytoplasm and JSR lumen of a cardiac myocyte.”
Changes to Ms. (page 6, line 6)
“A CRU of clustered RyRs has 22 RyR channels and a rogue RyR has 3 RyR channels
[5]. Figure 1c shows the distribution of clustered and rogue RyRs on a JSR for
simulation. CRUs of clustered RyRs (blue dots, ~2 in a JSR) are surrounded by
randomly distributed rogue RyRs (red dots, ~8 in a JSR). The number and location of
clustered and rogue RyRs in each JSR are random in simulations.”
Changes to Ms. (page 7, line 15)
“Moreover, J rogue and J clustered are the Ca2+ fluxes released by rogue and clustered
RyRs respectively, which can be written as:
J rogue <U+F03D> <U+F073> rogue <U+F0E5> <U+F064> ( x <U+F02D> xirogue , y <U+F02D> y roguej )S ( xirogue , y rogue

j , t; Tclustered ), (2.9)
i, j
where <U+F064> is the Dirac delta function and S is a stochastic function for the opening of
clustered and rogue RyRs, ( xirogue , y rogue j ) and ( xiclustered , y clustered
j ) are the positions of
rogue RyRs and clustered RyRs in the 2D plane respectively.”
Changes to Ms. (page 10, line 17)
“Figure 2a shows a computational Ca2+ quark through a rogue RyR to mimic the line-
scan measurements when the release time is set to 20 ms. The computational domain is
a square of 5×5 µm2 with the distribution of clustered and rogue RyRs on the JSR
membrane in figure 1c.”
Changes to Ms. (page 11, line13)
“Accordingly, figure 2e shows the computational results of Ca2+ sparks in a JSR with
random distribution of clustered and rogue RyRs in figure 1c. The regular Ca2+ spark
(left) due to an opening CRU of clustered RyRs is initiated by three opening rogue RyRs.
The large spark (right) results from two CRUs of clustered RyRs activated by four

“Moreover, sensitivity analysis on the firing frequency of Ca2+ sparks was performed
with respect to the number of rogue RyRs varying in the range of 2-14 in figure 6c. The
opening of clustered RyRs monotonically increases with the increase of the number of
rogue RyRs at high [Ca2+]lumen .”

“Furthermore, the changes in the number of rogue RyRs in a JSR may induce potential
heart diseases. For example, a reduction of the number of rogue RyRs could lead to an
inhibition of Ca2+ waves and dyssynchronous Ca2+ transients in myocytes of congestive
heart failure [39]. Atrial fibrillation associated with overactive Ca2+ release could be
related to the increased number of rogue RyRs [40].”

Minor comments and text corrections
1. Please clarify that “rogue RyRs” is also used to refer to non-junctional RyRs in other
studies (such as in Lu, Xia, Ye and Cheng 2010; Lu, Xia and Zhu 2012, both of which
should also be cited in the introduction) and ensure it is clarified that the terminology
in this study refers to non-clustered RyRs within a single junctional space, to avoid
confusion of interpretation.
Response: We cited the reference and revised the manuscript as suggested.
Changes to Ms. (page 3, line 7)
“Here, rogue RyRs refer to RyR channels located near clustered RyRs within a JSR,
defined as “junctional rogue RyRs”.”
Changes to Ms. (page 3, line 12)
“Zima et al. demonstrated experimentally that single RyR opening could mediate Ca2+
leak but fail to trigger Ca2+ sparks when free Ca2+ concentration in the JSR lumen
([Ca2+]lumen) is below a threshold level [11]. On the other hand, mathematical models
have been developed to investigate the dynamics of Ca2+ sparks and quarks. Sobie et al.
proposed a model to solve the paradox of [Ca2+]lumen to support the existence of rogue
RyRs [12]. Models of Ca2+ leak from JSRs have been used to characterize differences
between Ca2+ sparks and quarks [13]. Walker et al. included the computational
nonspark-based Ca2+ leak from JSRs to explain the exponential rise of Ca2+ spark
frequency [14]. They further presented that Ca2+ sparks could be triggered by
spontaneous opening of a single RyR in a cluster [15]. A stochastic contact network
model of the Ca2+ initiation process was applied to realistic RyR cluster structures,
which revealed that the Ca2+ sparks probability depends on the position of the initial
RyR in the cluster. Their works provided insight into the Ca2+ release process in the
heart and a framework for evaluating functional heterogeneity in populations of
receptor clusters under normal and pathological conditions. Lu et al. investigated “non-
junctional rogue RyRs” located away from the release sites and showed their effects on
Ca2+ waves with heart failure [16, 17]. It suggested that Ca2+ dynamics was unstable
and Ca2+ waves were likely to be triggered when “non-junctional rogue RyRs” were
taken into consideration. The variation of membrane potential depolarization was
indicated to be dependent on the distribution density of rogue RyR channels, which is
important for understanding arrhythmogenic mechanism for heart failure from
subcellular to cellular level. Sato and Bers used a mathematical model of JSR Ca2+
releases to show that single RyR opening at low [Ca2+]lumen could not recruit Ca2+ sparks
from Ca2+ release units (CRUs) [18]. However, the effects of rogue RyRs on Ca2+ sparks
at high [Ca2+]lumen remain unknown. The anomalous subdiffusion of cytoplasmic Ca2+
and the random distribution of JSR RyRs, unnoticed in these models, could unveil the
temporal and spatial properties of Ca2+ sparks and quarks. ”
2. Please define “anomalous subdiffusion order”
Response: Done.

3. Where does the number 0.64 in equations 2.8,9 come from?
Response: In a cardiac myocyte Ca2+ are released from JSR lumen into a 3D volume.
The conversion factor 0.64 proposed by Izu et al. is used to give the identical
distribution in 2D (Izu, Wier and Balke 2001) because of the 2D balanced equation for
[Ca 2+ ]cyto . So the spark in the 2D model has about the same spatial spread and time
course as the 3D spark. This conversion factor was also used in other studies (such as
in Lu, Xia, Ye et al. 2010; Chen, Kang, Fu et al. 2013)
Changes to Ms. (page 8, line 4)
“The equivalent source strength of rogue RyRs and clustered RyRs [28] are expressed
by
<U+F073> rogue <U+F03D> 0.64I rogue ([Ca 2+ ]lumen <U+F02D> [Ca 2+ ]cyto ) / 2F , (2.10)
<U+F073> clustered <U+F03D> 0.64I clustered ([Ca 2+ ]lumen <U+F02D> [Ca 2+ ]cyto ) / 2F , (2.11)
where the Faraday constant F is 96500 C·mol-1, and I rogue and I clustered are the
average currents through rogue and clustered RyRs, set to be 0.07 pA/mM and 0.7
pA/mM. Note that Ca2+ are released from the JSR lumen into a 3D volume in the
cytoplasm of a cardiac myocytes. The conversion factor 0.64 in equations (2.10) and
(2.11) is used to give the identical Ca2+ distribution in 2D [24]. ”

“In a 2D model similar to Izu et al. [24], the regular intervals between Ca2+ release
sites are lx (= 2 µm) in the longitudinal direction (x-axis) and ly (= 0.8 µm) in the
transverse direction (y-axis). Figure 1a shows the geometrical model of a cardiac
myocyte. Each Ca2+ release site represents a JSR. The schematic representative of a
JSR is shown in figure 1b, which includes randomly distributed clustered RyRs and
rogue RyRs. A CRU of clustered RyRs has 22 RyR channels and a rogue RyR has 3
RyR channels [5, 25]. Figure 1c shows the distribution of clustered and rogue RyRs on
a JSR for simulation.”
5. The size of the mesh of 5µm x 5µm seems an odd choice for the simulation of a single
junction given that this is larger than spacing between sites. Can the authors please
justify this choice?
Response: In the simulation of figure 3, a Ca2+ spark initiated from a JSR in the center
of the computational domain. The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) is ~2 µm.
Hence, we selected the computational domain of 5µm x 5µm (2.5 times FWHM) to
satisfy the Ca2+ diffusion.
6. There is repeated use of two abbreviations – QCR, QCD, without clear definition.
Response: We have defined the two abbreviations (QCR and QCD) in page 3, line 4
and page 10, line 22, respectively. Please see the below revisions.
“Recently, the discovery of quarky Ca2+ releases (QCRs or Ca2+ quarks) due to the
opening of rogue RyRs has been shown as a significant Ca2+ release mechanism
relevant to “invisible Ca2+ leak” [7-9].”
“Figure 2b plots the time courses of a QCR-QCD pair (i.e., a quarky Ca2+ release-
quarky Ca2+ depletion pair) corresponding to figure 2a. The values of t67 and <U+0394>F/F0
were computed to be 22.0 and 22.5 ms and 0.065 and 0.025 for QCR and QCD,
respectively.”
