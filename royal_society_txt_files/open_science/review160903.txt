Comments to the Author(s)

This paper covers "interactive numerals", the authors' coinage to describe numerals as
experienced in interactive systems. It is pleasing to read, and covers an important topic.
However, there are several issues with the work’s presentation and scope: it is not sufficiently
precise about its core term, and it fails to give adequate consideration to related work.
In short, I can’t recommend publication without a major rework, which
• Clearly and crisply defines interactive numerals;
• Delineates the anatomy of interactive numerals
• Considers more fully the surrounding literature and numeric input situations. A better
connection to the HCI literature in particular would reinforce the value of this contribution.
• Offers a stronger sense of what could be done, beyond saying that programming is hard.
Further details follow.
Firstly, the authors do not clearly delineate what an interactive numeral is. This leads to several
glosses that make their case difficult to understand, as the boundaries are not clearly defined.
Interactive numerals seem to at times consist of i) a means of displaying a numeral; ii) a means of
entering a numeral; iii) the underlying computational number representation system; iv) a
language for carrying out computations over numbers; v) tools for storing and recalling numbers
from memory. Without having clarity over the boundaries and scope of interactive numerals, it
is hard to make a clean argument in the rest of the paper.
Much of the text is concerned with Apple’s calculators, which are not particularly intended as
serious tools. The argument that Apple has the best programmers in the world does not really
hold much water here – whether or not that is true, if there was no strong focus on making the
calculators high quality, it is just as likely that they are someone’s pet project. With calculators in
general, there are many approaches taken to ameliorate some of the issues here. This includes
ones where the current set of operations is shown, and calculators that use reverse Polish notation
(RPN) to combine numbers. RPN calculators have a different profile of potential user error, but
are often preferred by engineers and scientists as they give greater clarity about the current state.
The example of the bank accounts is especially troubling. Bank accounts are absolutely not
numbers. They are identifiers that happen to be composed of numeric digits, and any
programmer who treats them as numbers has made an error – for example, storing a bank
account number in an integer column in a database will, almost inevitably, lead to hard to fix
bugs in the future. Additionally, exactly the same errors would occur with a letter based
identifier that did not have clear internal boundaries. As a supporting aside, my online banking
forcibly breaks card numbers into sets of 4 digits, and adds interactive elements to this form that
cause multiple repeated problems for people used to tabbing between entry fields. They also
silently discard any key-presses which would add a 5th digit to the final field.
Put together, this means that it is hard to understand whether interactive numerals should be
“the number box on simple calculators” or “anything where people type numbers and symbols”,
whether this characteristic is lost if the current set of operations is still displayed (e.g. “1 + 5”). Is
the R REPL an interactive numeral? An Excel cell? Or the Excel cell along with the shared entry
field at the top? The time display on my cooker? (Which, co-incidentally suffers from issues fully
in line with the ones you raise). There are also differing degrees of interactivity and state in these
numerals. The web forms shown may have front end validation, but they will then typically
transmit a final number (or at least a string hoping to become a number) to be processed
elsewhere. This has a different set of affordances and issues to the display on a calculator which
includes a certain set of state and programmatic capability. It would be helpful to make sense of
some of these distinctions.
3
Some closely related domains are omitted, which for a solid treatment of interactive numerals
should be considered.
• Possibly the most glaring omission is the spreadsheet, which is central to many business
practices, and has been the technology behind many numerically driven failures. Surely the cells
in a spreadsheet count as particularly powerful and evolved interactive numerals, and one can
see the steps taken to make them work as such – separating input and display, maintaining
formulae rather than just the current state, reporting a variety of errors etc. If not, we need a
much crisper scope for interactive numerals to explain why these are not them.
• When moving to some of the web based examples in particular, huge effort has been put
into the validation of user entered data: any reasonably grown up web framework will have
libraries both front end and client side for validation of numbers among other data types, which
can give immediate and exact feedback about incorrect entries. This may or may not fall under
the domain of premature semantics – typically, the semantics are given, and the user is prevented
from entering invalid data. This also extends to complex data – for example, when entering VISA
credit card numbers (although they are not really numbers), invalid strings are often reported
immediately before the data is sent to the server.
• In the case of entering simple numbers, there is a huge variety of techniques used, from
dials and sliders to number boxes. These are noted, but as they are a commonly used response to
some of the issues discussed here. As an example, the “number boxes” used in the Max/MSP
programming language look like simple number displays, but have rich user input methods
around modifying and storing numeric data, while preventing non-numbers from being entered.
The introduction of premature semantics is interesting, but needs more work. The discussion of
number entry (p.8, l6) is at odds with previous statements. Entering ‘0 . . 5’ would, on most
calculators, produce 0.5 (p.3, l31). At a guess, this is what the user probably intended. It is
interpreted as a number – in what way has it processed it incorrectly? This seems more like a case
of semantics being used to correctly discard impossible user input, or at least a reasonable
interpretation of unclear input. Some validation systems would show some kind of error when
the second point was entered, but apart from that, how should things be improved? In the second
example (p.8, l12) it is not clear to which NaN you are referring. If it is the work in (p.3, l48), then
this seems to hinge on the semantics of [delete] and the [±] key as much as anything else. Starting
with 0 in a calculator clearly causes issues, but many calculating systems do not do this. The
discussion of the ‘creative’ use of 999 in number entry fields goes some way towards explicating
things, but it feels rather like pushing the problem around – who is in the best position to decide
what to do about missing data? Is this really premature semantics, or an incomplete semantics
which should really include an explicit “no data” state (as implemented in e.g. the R
programming language, whose semantics includes both a lack of data and a calculation which
resulted in no number being produced.). This question has an overlap with the interactive
numerals used to enter the data, but it is only partial.
Finally, I have never counted references before, but the level of self citation in this particular piece
seems somewhat excessive – by my count 19 of the 29 references are self citations. Of the
remainder, most are relatively general, and only a couple deal with the issue of correctly entering
data into numeric systems. I find it hard to believe that no-one else has carried out significant
work here. It is also difficult to understand what this paper adds relative to the authors’ existing
work. If the intention here is to sum up work on interactive numerals, then they need to be more
clearly defined and situated. The abstract states that interactive numerals are introduced here –
are they different from the “interactive numbers” of the authors’ previous work?
Some specific points:
• P.10,l10 – surely displaying NaN is showing that an error has occurred – in what way is
it ignoring error?
• P.12,l51 – there may be some more recent literature about multi-keystroke characters
given both the adoption of Unicode and more recently the rise of Emoji as a form of
communication.

This paper really hits the nail on the head; I had idly wondered over the years why I find it so
difficult to use simple calculators, and this work not only clearly identifies the issues involved,
but also points to a principled way forwards. Excellent research!
I found just a couple of unclear or oddly worded sentences that should be tidied up:
• "...and do not notice these errors nearly about 4% of the time."
• "A patient’s age is certainly a number, but interactively there is a point before the number is
correct, but the premature semantics required a number regardless."
• "Many systems, because the display is assumed must always display a number, display a
numeral even before anything has been entered..."
• "Many calculators provide buttons to use a memory, but..." ("a memory" implies that the
calculators can have several memory registers, but then the rest of the paragraph reads as though
there is only one register available)

Associate Editor's comments:
An interesting set of observations - while you limit yourself to the UI questions associated with
numerals, I wonder if erroneous input in other areas (e.g. passwords) is related, and if so how?
The paper makes novel contributions but also needs to address the comments made in the longer
review, which are somewhat more significant than minor revision would allow for.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
Comments to the Author:
I'm pretty happy with this now - i still think there's rather a lot of self citing - there is other
literature on the general problem of erroneous input in other forms, and there are at least 2 ways
to mitigate it (e.g. allow only the relevant strongly type-checked input at the right moment, and
use confirmation of the input by displaying it back in a different form - most banking apps do
this now - many webform libraries/SDKs also have provision for doing this). Also, you may
want to consider what happens in systems with arbitrary precision arithmetic (one of the
underlying ways of avoiding, or necessitating avoidance of early-binding of numeric input
semantics)
I'd be interested also in comments on other erroneous systems which have gone the other way -
e..g predictive text input systems (including search bar auto-complete)....
Otherwise, I think you have addressed the key reviewer comments, and I than you for the care in
defining the problem carefully in sections 3 a-e - that strengthens the contribution significantly, I
believe.
I'm assuming there are some ethical considerations!
Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-160903.R1)
Thanks for your new comments, which have inspired some clarifications and minor additions.
We have tightened up our discussion of types and added a bit on forms. We did mention
arbitrary precision, but we've now made it a bit clearer.

We added a few more useful references to help address the self-citation problem you identified.
We've added the ethical considerations - thanks for spotting that oversight!

response to the referees. (Changing the colours back to black will be trivial.) As a consequence, the
Conclusions have also been significantly revised though not necessarily to address to specific feedback.
Minor corrections, such as correcting typos, have been made throughout and these are not specially
indicated. Thanks to the referees and editor for their helpful comments!
Associate Editor's comments:
> An interesting set of observations --- while you limit yourself to the UI questions associated with
numerals, I wonder if erroneous input in other areas (e.g. passwords) is related, and if so how?
We have now defined 'quasi-numerals' (p4) to clearly address and circumscribe this concern. This
definition fits into our new section of definitions, which again we found useful to add. Thanks.

> This paper really hits the nail on the head; I had idly wondered over the years why I find it so difficult
to use simple calculators, and this work not only clearly identifies the issues involved, but also points to
a principled way forwards. Excellent research!
We noticed the very different perspectives of the two reviewers. We have therefore added some
highlighted paragraphs (marked with ! marks) that discuss perspectives on the research, for example
discussing the problems that equating numerals and numbers (which is otherwise often innocuous) raise
in computer systems.
Thanks for the suggested detailed corrections. All have been made.
Reviewer: 1
> it is not sufficiently precise about its core term
We have added a new section 3, p3, that defines terms precisely. We think readers will find this helpful.
This also led us to realise that one section of analysis was more about feature interaction on calculators
than interactive numerals. We therefore deleted that section.
> and it fails to give adequate consideration to related work ... Considers more fully the surrounding
literature and numeric input situations. A better connection to the HCI literature in particular would
reinforce the value of this contribution.
> Finally, I have never counted references before, but the level of self citation in this particular piece
seems somewhat excessive - by my count 19 of the 29 references are self citations. Of the remainder,
most are relatively general, and only a couple deal with the issue of correctly entering data into numeric
systems. I find it hard to believe that no-one else has carried out significant work here.
We acknowledge there that there is limited research in this area of HCI, and we now point this out on
page 11.
We have given some thought to inserting a Related Work section (or similar) but interactive numerals
are really at a level of interaction below any existing HCI research, other than our own, and they are
tangential to the typical concerns of other fields. Such a section might show our readers that we know
the area of HCI, the study of errors in interaction and the like, but we think it would add little in terms of
elucidating the substance of the paper.
> Offers a stronger sense of what could be done, beyond saying that programming is hard.
The new section 3 precisely defining interactive numerals makes it clear that an interactive numeral
need not be equated to its value and also the semantic structures that are needed. These function as a
high-level specification for improving future interactive systems. We have highlighted this as a key step
towards engineering suitable solutions in our conclusions.
> Much of the text is concerned with Apple's calculators, which are not particularly intended as serious
tools.
There is general anecdotal evidence from our own research and that of colleagues that calculators on
mobiles are used as convenient tools in medicine. We have given a recently reported example which
resulted in two near-fatalities. Whether intended as serious tools or not, they are being used as such.
> This includes ones where the current set of operations is shown, and calculators that use reverse
Polish notation (RPN) to combine numbers. RPN calculators have a different profile of potential user
error, but are often preferred by engineers and scientists as they give greater clarity about the current
state.
We have a new discussion on RPN on p6, and argue against the relevance of this view for addressing
interactive numerals.
> The example of the bank accounts is especially troubling.
With our clear definitions, bank accounts are considered quasi-numerals (p5), and this tidies up the
discussion.
> Possibly the most glaring omission is the spreadsheet,
Now discussed as part of the definitions section on p6.
> When moving to some of the web based examples in particular,
We think our new definitions (p3, section 3) improve the insights on this and many related topics; but
we feel there is insufficient space in the paper to explore the wide range of applications/areas, since it
would confuse applications for the underlying principles.
> In the case of entering simple numbers, there is a huge variety of techniques used, from dials and
sliders to number boxes.
Discussed on p6 to help scope the goals of papers.
> Entering `0 . . 5' would, on most calculators, produce 0.5 (p.3, l31). At a guess, this is what the user
probably intended. It is interpreted as a number - in what way has it processed it incorrectly? This
seems more like a case of semantics being used to correctly discard impossible user input, or at least a
reasonable interpretation of unclear input.
Now explained fully (p6-7). In some cases, 0..5 may be what the user intended. In some case it may
not. It is impossible to know. But not representing what the user *did*, which is a matter of fact, will
definitely lead to problems whenever the assumption is wrong.
> It is also difficult to understand what this paper adds relative to the authors' existing work.
We point out top of p3 that our previous work had not clarified the semantics of interactive numerals the
way we have done here. References to our previous work also make clear the distinction between the
problems of interactive numerals and the errors that we were addressing.
> P.10,l10 - surely displaying NaN is showing that an error has occurred --- in what way is it ignoring
error?
Explained on p12. We have clarified as follows: NaN is an internal value representation that means
nothing to non-technical users - clearly, displaying it to general users is a fault in the calculator itself: it
has ignored an error, and its number representation code has failed to display it as either a number or
as an error message.
> P.12,l51 - there may be some more recent literature about multi-keystroke characters given both the
adoption of Unicode and more recently the rise of Emoji as a form of communication.
This would extend our concern for interactive numerals into new territory which we highlight in point (v)
of our conclusions. As the reviewer points out, it is potentially quite problematic just like interactive
numerals but we felt it is beyond the scope for our current concerns because of the huge difference in
---
We have opted for and are happy with 'open peer review' but think the referees and editor may not
think this is sufficiently helpful on this occasion. Please ask them.
