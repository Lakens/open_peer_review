This paper is a little disjointed. Ostensibly, it is about a new non-human animal model of
depression: in farm raised salmon. However, the only empirical evidence the researchers bring to
bear on this issue is that depression-like syndrome (DLS) fish have a chronically activated HPA
axis and elevated index of serotonin transmission. These are indeed consistent with depression,
but they are not unique to the depressed state. Both of these are also upregulated in infection, for
instance. Perhaps these fish have an undiagnosed infection. Have the researchers looked at what
is happening to the immune system?
It’s not that I believe that the researchers are wrong. It’s possible that future research will show
that this phenotype in farm raised salmon is a depression-like syndrome. However, the body of
evidence needed to make a good prima facie case for this would do more than simply assess HPA
activation and serotonin transmission.
The researchers do report: “we observed (although we did not quantify) that small, anorexic fish
tended to locate at the periphery of sea cages, contrary to healthy fish that usually occupy the
centre. Moreover, these small, anorexic fish tended to spend more time at the surface with a head
up / tail down position and displayed decreased reactivity to environmental stimuli such as
food. Notably, the emaciated state of these fish indicates strongly suppressed feeding behaviour
(Fig 1).”
However, I think quantification is needed to build a prima facie case for a depressive like
syndrome. Moreover, even if all these behavioral observations were supported by quantitative
evidence, it would still be consistent with an undiagnosed infection. The fact that the researchers
have no idea what is causing the phenotype also indicates that their conclusions are a bit
premature.
I think this would be a stronger paper if the authors wrote their paper around the question of
what is happening physiologically with these emaciated fish, because that is what their evidence
is really about. In the discussion section, they could speculate about the possible causes, but I
think depression would only be one such hypothesis.

A very interesting and well written paper taking a new angle on welfare in salmon aquaculture.
The authors have quoted previous works to demonstrate the relevance of this work to salmon
aquaculture practices today, as follows: they state that a significant proportion of salmon in
aquaculture end up as non-growers, or losers (attributed to Stien et al.), and that fish are
commonly vaccinated during smoltification (attributed to Huntingford et al.). However, neither
paper makes any such statement. These apparent missquotes are all the more surprising given
that one of the authors of the present manuscript was also an author on the Stien paper. There
may be many more of the references which are misquoted and the authors are hence asked to
revise the paper, firstly removing these citations, and then checking all other references for
verification of accuracy, making appropriate amendments, and then re-submitting.

The Vindas et al. manuscript is an interesting proposal do assess the effects of chronic stress on
further responses of the 5-HTergic system to stressful manipulations. The paper could have
important implications for fisheries research as well as to the larger field of stress research, as it
suggests that diffuse chronic stress can blunt the responsiveness of the 5-HTergic system.
Nonetheless, I have several concerns regarding the methods and the soudness of the conclusions.
1 - The title of the paper references chronic stress; nonetheless, since we do not know the history
of stimulation for the GS animals, we cannot infer that they are stressed. In fact, since they come
from the same tank as the healthy animals, one can assume from the experimental manipulations
that they were not stressed at all. To characterize chronic stress, the authors should actually
perform stressful manipulations for a period of time and see if that leads to emaciation/growth
defects that are asssociated with alterations in 5-HT and cortisol levels.
2 - In the methods section, the authors state that they sampled fish from two different time
periods to control for repeatability and production phase differences. If we run analyze the data
on Table 1 (as the author should have done), we see that there are differences between healthy
animals in S1 and S2, as well as between GS animals in S1 and S2. These differences reflect in the
results from 5-HT analysis. To rule out historical factors between S1 and S2, the authors should
replicate the experiment in another batch of animals and see if these differences are still present;
if they are not, this represents a serious threat to the internal validity of the results.
3 - In the Discussion, the authors make statements which are not supported by the data. For
example, in p. 6, lines 186-187, they state that they've shown that GS fish "suffer from chronic
activation of the 5-HT system"; to demonstrate that, the author need to show that 5-HT levels are
always increased. Figure 2, panel IV, contradicts this hypothesis because Healthy animals do not
differ from GS animals in basal conditions.
7
4 - In the Abstract, the authors hypothesize that "5-HT behavioural inhibition may have evolved
in vertebrates to minimize unpredictable stress exposure in vulnerable individuals". They have
not tested behavioural inhibition, nor did they use unpredictable stress protocols. The hypothesis
is as good as any, based on the literature, but does not follow from the results reported in the
manuscript.
Given these considerations, I suggest toning down all the overstatements, changing the title to
"Growth stunded farmed salmon show increased brain 5-HT activity and blunted serotonergic
responses to stress" (which is more acurate, but less sexy), and replicating the experiment to
confirm that the differences between animals sampled at S1 and S2 is stable and not caused by
any event in that specific experiment.

Dear Reviewers
We are grateful for your evaluation of our work (Chronic stress and brain serotonin (5-
HT) activation in farmed salmon: pathology vs. adaptation). Thank you for your
instructive and helpful comments. We have now given close attention to the issues raised
and these are addressed in the revised manuscript and changes are listed (in italics)
below.
Sincerely,
Marco A. Vindas
Reviewer #1 (Remarks to the Author):
This paper is a little disjointed. Ostensibly, it is about a new non-human animal model
of depression: in farm raised salmon. However, the only empirical evidence the
researchers bring to bear on this issue is that depression-like syndrome (DLS) fish have
a chronically activated HPA axis and elevated index of serotonin transmission. These
are indeed consistent with depression, but they are not unique to the depressed state.
Both of these are also upregulated in infection, for instance. Perhaps these fish have
an undiagnosed infection. Have the researchers looked at what is happening to the
immune system?
It’s not that I believe that the researchers are wrong. It’s possible that future research
will show that this phenotype in farm raised salmon is a depression-like syndrome.
However, the body of evidence needed to make a good prima facie case for this would
do more than simply assess HPA activation and serotonin transmission.
The researchers do report: “we observed (although we did not quantify) that small,
anorexic fish tended to locate at the periphery of sea cages, contrary to healthy fish
that usually occupy the centre. Moreover, these small, anorexic fish tended to spend
more time at the surface with a head up / tail down position and displayed decreased
reactivity to environmental stimuli such as food. Notably, the emaciated state of these
fish indicates strongly suppressed feeding behaviour (Fig 1).”
However, I think quantification is needed to build a prima facie case for a depressive
like syndrome. Moreover, even if all these behavioral observations were supported by
quantitative evidence, it would still be consistent with an undiagnosed infection. The
fact that the researchers have no idea what is causing the phenotype also indicates
that their conclusions are a bit premature.
I think this would be a stronger paper if the authors wrote their paper around the
question of what is happening physiologically with these emaciated fish, because that
is what their evidence is really about. In the discussion section, they could speculate
about the possible causes, but I think depression would only be one such hypothesis.
We agree with the point raised by the reviewer about the symptoms displayed by
growth-stunted (GS) fish. We have renamed the paper and rewritten abstract and
introduction to acknowledge more the one undisputable fact: what we are seeing is a
chronically stressed phenotype. It is indeed a possibility that the fish may have a yet
undiagnosed disease that we are not aware of at this time, in fact in all likelihood the
proximate causation depends on a complex interaction between immune status, stress,
and perhaps social hierarchies. However, this discussion is beyond the scope of this
paper, future research within our group is proposed to focus towards understanding
better these individuals and study other physiological aspects that could be at play in
developing this phenotype. In the current manuscript we wish to present our current
findings and possible implications this may have in order to encourage also others to
study this interesting phenomenon. We have now rewritten the manuscript so that it is
more focused towards describing the novel results on the physiology of GS fish. We fully
acknowledge that further investigations are needed to pinpoint the proximate causes of
the stressed phenotype (L166-167) and discuss some possibilities (L186-201).
Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author):
A very interesting and well written paper taking a new angle on welfare in salmon
aquaculture. The authors have quoted previous works to demonstrate the relevance
of this work to salmon aquaculture practices today, as follows: they state that a
significant proportion of salmon in aquaculture end up as non-growers, or losers
(attributed to Stien et al.), and that fish are commonly vaccinated during
smoltification (attributed to Huntingford et al.). However, neither paper makes any
such statement. These apparent missquotes are all the more surprising given that one
of the authors of the present manuscript was also an author on the Stien paper. There
may be many more of the references which are misquoted and the authors are hence
asked to revise the paper, firstly removing these citations, and then checking all other
references for verification of accuracy, making appropriate amendments, and then re-
submitting.
We believe that it is very important to properly cite previous literature and appreciate
the points raised by rev 2. However, we stand by the use of the mentioned references.
Specifically, in Stien et al. 2013 we conducted (both the main and the senior author are
part of this publication) a review of several welfare aspects within the aquaculture
industry in order to create a welfare score system based on published literature. In
page 44 of this article there is a section pertaining to Emaciation state in fish. Here it is
mentioned how emaciated fish (non-growers) are common in aquaculture but little
studied. Thereafter we cite Stephen and Ribble (1995) and their study on a group of
such individuals. In order to avoid any confusion we have now in the current version of
the manuscript we present both mentioned references together, so as to provide the
reader with all the information immediately and avoid possible confusions (L44-48).
Furthermore, Huntingford et al. 2006 reviews several human activities that may cause
ethical/welfare concerns for fish species. In page 356 the authors summarize in a table
examples of studies on the impacts of several common aquaculture practices on the
welfare of fish, which includes disease treatment (e.g. vaccination). Since this review
does not provide much more information about this practice we have also included in
this section the reference for Sørum and Damsgård 2004, which focuses specifically on
the side effects of vaccination in aquaculture (L193). We have also thoroughly revised
all our citations in order to avoid other possible confusions between previously
published articles and our current results.
Dear Dr Matthew Allinson,
Please find enclosed our revised manuscript now titled “Brain serotonergic
activation in growth-stunted farmed salmon: adaptation vs. pathology” (RSOS-
160030; previously titled “Chronic stress and chronic serotonin (5-HT) activation
in farmed salmon: pathology vs. adaptation”).
We are grateful for your, and the reviewers, evaluation of our work and would
like to thank you for your instructive and helpful comments. We have given close
attention to the issues raised and addressed these in our revised manuscript
where appropiate. Please find a detailed response to each comment below.
We hope that you find our amended manuscript suitable for publication in Royal
Society Open Science

Reviewer #3 (Remarks to the Author):
1 - The title of the paper references chronic stress; nonetheless, since we do not know
the history of stimulation for the GS animals, we cannot infer that they are stressed. In
fact, since they come from the same tank as the healthy animals, one can assume
from the experimental manipulations that they were not stressed at all. To
characterize chronic stress, the authors should actually perform stressful
manipulations for a period of time and see if that leads to emaciation/growth
defects that are associated with alterations in 5-HT and cortisol levels.
We have characterized the cortisol and the serotonergic response of growth-
stunted (GS) and healthy fish at basal (fish sampled directly from their rearing
cage) and post-stress (after an acute confinement stress test) conditions. At two
separate sampling occasions the cortisol and serotonergic activity values displayed
by GS fish at basal levels are characteristic of salmonids under stress. Elevated
plasma cortisol is arguably the most widely used indicator of stress in fish, and
salmonids typically display levels = 10 ng/ml at basal conditions, while a stressor
may result in a 10- to 100-fold increase depending on the species and the nature of
the stressor (Wendelaar Bonga, S.E. 1997 Physiol Rev 77, 591-625).
In this context, we observed that while healthy individuals had basal plasma
cortisol levels within the normal range, GS fish had plasma cortisol levels
comparable to that of stressed fish. That is, basal cortisol levels of GS fish were
approximatley 173 ng/ml (at sampling 1), which is similar to those exhibited by
healthy individuals post-stress (approximatley 92 ng/ml at sampling 1), and
comparable to those reported in the literature (e.g. Sørensen, C., Johansen, I. B.,
Øverli, Ø. 2013 Physiology of social stress in fishes. In The physiology of fishes. (eds.
D. H. Evans, J. B. Clairborne, S. Currie), pp. 289. Boca Raton: Taylor and Francis
Group).
characteristic of salmonid fish at basal conditions, while a 2- to 8-fold increase has
been reported post-stress (e.g. Øverli et al. 1999. Brain Behav Evol 54, 263-275, for
a review see Winberg and Nilsson 1993. Comp Biochem Physiol 106C, 597-614).
These values again are reflected in healthy indivdiuals at basal conditions
(approximately 85 ng/g at sampling 1) and post-stress (approximately 156 ng/g at
sampling 1) respectively, in our experiment. Furthemore, similar to cortisol, post-
stress 5-HIAA levels of healthy indivdiuals (approximately 156 ng/g at sampling 1)
are within the range of those displayed by GS fish at basal levels (approximately
210 ng/g at sampling 1). As the reviewer points out, we do not know the history of
stimulation of these GS fish. Therefore, in the current version of our manuscript we
point out that GS fish display a physiological profile reminiscent of fish that are
under stress, and that since this was consistent over two sampling points with
several months apart, these elevated levels are most likely the result of chronically
activated 5-HT and HPI-axis systems (page 4 Ln 149-153 and page 4 Ln 161-
163).
Note that the patterns described for cortisol and 5-HIAA during sampling 1 are
maintained in sampling 2 as well, but we used here the values for sampling 1 as an
example to illustrate the general activation patterns.
2 - In the methods section, the authors state that they sampled fish from two
different time periods to control for repeatability and production phase
differences. If we run analyse the data on Table 1 (as the author should have
done), we see that there are differences between healthy animals in S1 and S2, as
well as between GS animals in S1 and S2. These differences reflect in the results
from 5-HT analysis. To rule out historical factors between S1 and S2, the authors
should replicate the experiment in another batch of animals and see if these
differences are still present; if they are not, this represents a serious threat to the
internal validity of the results.
As the reviewer points out, there are some differences in both cortisol and 5-HT
concentrations between sampling times. We would however like to point out that
the point of this paper is not to analyse variable hormone or neurotransmitter
concentrations over time, but the conserved response pattern. That is, the
indicators are always higher in GS compared to healthy fish at basal conditions,
and while cortisol increases in both fish types post-stress, the serotonergic activity
increases in response to stress in healthy fish only. These results are consistent
between samplings and represent the main core of our study. Granted, plasma
cortisol and 5-HT concentrations are overall higher in both healthy and GS
individuals during sampling 1, compared to sampling 2, which we had
acknowledged in the previous version of our manuscript in page 4 Ln 145-149:
“Notably, an increase in brain 5-HT and plasma cortisol concentrations of up to 50%
[24] to 100% [25] have been reported under smoltification (the metamorphosis that
prepares salmon for the salt water environment). In our experiment, fish were
sampled shortly after smoltification (sampling 1) and then again 5 months later. In
line with previous reports, both 5-HT and plasma cortisol levels were higher at the
sampling point closest to smoltification.” In the discussion of our current manuscript
we point out that both cortisol and 5-HT concentrations are known to vary with the
increase during smoltification (page 4, Ln 163-172).
3 - In the Discussion, the authors make statements which are not supported by
the data. For example, in p. 6, lines 186-187, they state that they've shown that
GS fish "suffer from chronic activation of the 5-HT system"; to demonstrate that,
the author need to show that 5-HT levels are always increased. Figure 2, panel
IV, contradicts this hypothesis because Healthy animals do not differ from GS
animals in basal conditions.
Our statement regarding signs of chronic activation of the 5-HT system is indeed
supported by our data. We would like to clarify that chronic activation of the
serotonergic system in our study is reflected by the measured 5-HIAA levels (which
are used as a proxy for serotonergic activity), not by concentrations of the
transmitter (5-HT) itself. We show that basal serotonergic activity is elevated
during both samplings in GS fish, compared to healthy individuals (and compared
to serotonergic activity values reported in the salmonid literature, see response for
comment 1 for further details), which is indicative of chronic activation of the 5-HT
system. We would like to clarify that the reviewer is referring only to our results on
5-HT levels, which are not a good proxy for serotonergic activity, as we explain in
the discussion (Page 4, Ln 175-181). 5-HT is rapidly replaced by newly synthetized
5-HT intracellularly following its release at the synapse and extracellular 5-HT
concentrations reflect both 5-HT release and clearance from the synapse. Instead, 5-
HIAA levels and the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio are commonly used as a proxy for
serotonergic activity, as the formation of the 5-HT metabolite 5-HIAA is almost
exclusively a result of monoamine oxidase metabolizing 5-HT after release into the
synapse and reuptake into the presynaptic neuron or surrounding cells.
4 - In the Abstract, the authors hypothesize that "5-HT behavioural inhibition
may have evolved in vertebrates to minimize unpredictable stress exposure in
vulnerable individuals". They have not tested behavioural inhibition, nor did
they use unpredictable stress protocols. The hypothesis is as good as any, based
on the literature, but does not follow from the results reported in the
manuscript.
In the current version of the manuscript we have modified this statement to avoid
the notion about unpredictability and to reflect that we propose that GS fish may
use behavioural inhibition in order to avoid exposure to further stress (page 1, Ln
27-28). That chronic 5-HT exposure inhibits active behaviour is well known (e.g.
Sørensen, et al. 2013. Physiology of social stress in fishes), and GS fish do indeed
show such inhibition (Stephen and Ribble 1995 Aquaculture 133, 1-8). We show
that GS fish have what appears to be a chronic elevated serotonergic system at
basal levels, which is unable to respond further to acute stress, and propose that
this may be associated with their behavioural inhibition.
Given these considerations, I suggest toning down all the overstatements,
changing the title to "Growth-stunted farmed salmon show increased brain 5-HT
activity and blunted serotonergic responses to stress" (which is more accurate,
but less sexy), and replicating the experiment to confirm that the differences
that specific experiment.
We have now changed the titled to “Brain serotonergic activation in growth-stunted
farmed salmon: adaption vs. pathology”, which, considering the comments by the
reviewer, we feel reflects more clearly the topic of our manuscript. However, we
believe that the discrepancies between our 2 samplings do not hinder the discussion
and conclusions we present here (please see the rebuttal for comments 2 and 3 for a
detailed discussion on this). We therefore feel confident on presenting our data for
publication as it is without additional experiments. However, we are encouraged by
our results and hope to encourage others into further investigating this phenomenon
in order to elucidate its etiology and mode of action further.
