Review of Guillaume Dezecache’s “The nature and distribution of affiliative behavior during
exposure to mild threat” (RSOS-170265)
The question of how humans collectively respond to danger is important for science and for
public health and safety. Yet, for ethical reasons, it is impossible to investigate this question by
conducting experiments that involve exposing individuals to actual danger. Dezecache et al.
conceived the novel idea of testing a theory about how people behave in threatening situations by
examining photographs on the Internet depicting groups of people visiting a haunted house
exhibit. Hypothesizing that affiliation would be the dominant response to this mildly threatening
situation, rather than self-preservation, Dezecache et al. asked people to rate the photographs in
terms of visible indicators of such behaviors. They considered that gripping another person, and
being gripped, would indicate a desire for affiliation. These responses were tallied by two coders
“blind” to the hypothesis.
They reported a number of interesting findings:
• Gripping was more common in females (supporting other evidence to that effect)
• The gripping ratio was also higher in females that males
• Age was inversely related to individual gripping behavior but unrelated to mutual gripping
• Group size was unrelated to gripping behavior
• Gripping was observed in 75% of the photographs
• As group size went up, mutual gripping went down (in groups larger than n=3)
These findings supported the concept and theory of a core “affiliative” response to immediate
response to danger.
Comments and Questions:
1) It was unclear from the text how those furthest from the exhibit behaved
2) It was noted that the people in the photographs were “familiars”, but the nature of their
relationship(s) was unclear. This fact should be emphasized by the authors, as the overall pattern
of responses observed in this study may not have been observed in groups of strangers visiting
the haunted house, or in everyday situations of danger.
Overall, the study was cleverly conceived and well done, and will add usefully to the literature
on the human response to threat and danger.

Responses to Referees (RSOS-170265)
Referee: 1
1.1 Abstract. Change ‘Yet, more than fifty years of research have showed that humans seek social
partners and behave prosocially when confronted by danger.’ To ‘Yet, more than fifty years of
research have showed that humans often seek social partners and behave prosocially when
confronted by danger.’ Although haunted house is known by ps not to be a real threat!
We would like to thank Referee 1 for this helpful comment. It is indeed the case that the seeking of
ocial partners during exposure to danger may only be a prevalent response, but it does not have to be
he only one. To acknowledge this, we replaced the sentence by the Referee’s suggestion (see lines 3-
4). Additionally, we acknowledge that the threat is not “real” in the type of settings data were collected
rom. Hence the use of the word ‘mild threat’ in the title.
1.2 Introduction. It needs to be made clearer how the authors that determined that gripping
represents a prosocial behaviour (since they said themselves it could be self-preservative in
meaning).
This point indeed is important and we tried to make our position clearer in the revised version of the
manuscript. Between lines 49 and 53, we now explain in more details why we think the distribution of
gripping behaviour might help reveal the motivation behind this affiliative behaviour. The rationale is
hat, if gripping is meant to protect others (or at least to optimize dyadic protection), we should expect
mutual gripping to be prevalent across group sizes.
1.3 Results p. 4 of the submission, line 95. Change no effect of proportional fear on group size to
no effect of group size on proportional fear.
This has been changed, see lines 144-145.
1.4 The results section needs to be structured around the three hypotheses. At the moment the
results are just a list of tests and it wasn’t clear how they related to the hypotheses.
We appreciate the comment of Referee 1. However, we reckon that it is difficult to present results for
each hypothesis separately as they make predictions that are tested in common analyses. However, and
o help guide readers, we now remind the hypotheses at three different occasions in the Results sections
see lines 101, 111-112 and 143).
1.5 Figures. Figure 2 labelling seems to be incomplete. What does the pink line mean?
The pink line (and the other light-colored blue and green lines) represented projections from the linear
modelling on the dataset (see the legend of Figure 2.A in the original submission). We removed these
ines from Figure 2.A as they are not discussed in the Manuscript and do not directly contribute to our
actual story.

2.1 Review of Guillaume Dezecache’s “The nature and distribution of affiliative behavior during
exposure to mild threat” (RSOS-170265).The question of how humans collectively respond to
danger is important for science and for public health and safety. Yet, for ethical reasons, it is
mpossible to investigate this question by conducting experiments that involve exposing
ndividuals to actual danger. Dezecache et al. conceived the novel idea of testing a theory about
how people behave in threatening situations by examining photographs on the Internet depicting
groups of people visiting a haunted house exhibit. Hypothesizing that affiliation would be the
dominant response to this mildly threatening situation, rather than self-preservation, Dezecache
et al. asked people to rate the photographs in terms of visible indicators of such behaviors. They
considered that gripping another person, and being gripped, would indicate a desire for affiliation.
These responses were tallied by two coders “blind” to the hypothesis.
They reported a number of interesting findings:
Gripping was more common in females (supporting other evidence to that effect)
The gripping ratio was also higher in females that males
Age was inversely related to individual gripping behavior but unrelated to mutual gripping
Group size was unrelated to gripping behavior
Gripping was observed in 75% of the photographs
As group size went up, mutual gripping went down (in groups larger than n=3)
These findings supported the concept and theory of a core “affiliative” response to immediate
response to danger.
We would like to thank the Referee for her/his careful reading of our research article.
2.2 Comments and Questions: 1) It was unclear from the text how those furthest from the
exhibit behaved
We now elaborate on the effect of position in the scene on gripping behaviour (lines 117-123). We also
made it clearer, at various places in the manuscript, that the position from the exit is inferred from the
group travel direction (lines 64, 114 and 123).
2.3 2) It was noted that the people in the photographs were “familiars”, but the nature of their
relationship(s) was unclear. This fact should be emphasized by the authors, as the overall pattern
of responses observed in this study may not have been observed in groups of strangers visiting the
haunted house, or in everyday situations of danger.
This is a critical point which we now discuss at the very end of our article, lines 220-223.
2.4 Overall, the study was cleverly conceived and well done, and will add usefully to the literature
on the human response to threat and danger.
We are happy to read that the Referee thinks highly of our contribution, and we hope that the rest of the
academic audience will judge it alike.
