The manuscript "Influence of silicon on growth mechanism of MAO
coating on cast Al-Si alloy" reports about the preparation of oxide coatings, with a thickness of 15-
18 microns, on ZL109 Al-Si alloy and by using the Micro-arc oxidation (MAO) technique. The
authors cross several experimental analysis (XRD, GIXD, SEM and EPMA) for a complete
morphological, structural and elemental analysis of the samples and for the connection of these
characteristics with the fabrication process parameters.
From a general point of view, the manuscript is interesting and clear. The results are well
supported by the experimental data and the discussions are, in general, reliable and well-founded
on general principles.
So, in principle, the manuscript is suitable for publication, but requires, before publication, some
revisions as noted:
1) The authors talk about TEM (transmission electron microscopy) analysis. Perhaps this is a
mistake and they refer to SEM (scanning electron microscopy) analysis, instead.
2) Several points need to be quantified. As examples:
a) all the extracted experimental data should be accompained by the corresponding errors.
b) "Very few P is found in the coating, which shows that the electrolyte has little effect on the
coating composition.". Please, quantify. And similar statements without explicit quantification.
3) "The average roughness (Ra) of the substrate is 1 micron". What is the analysis from which
this information was extracted? Typically, AFM analysis are used for quantify surface roughness
(see, as examples: Superlattices and Microstructures 113, 430 (2018); Nanoscale Research Letters 6,
112 (2011)). Please, comment.
4) "The pores on the Al-Si alloy are larger, with diameters in the range
of 3-6 microns and a low density; while the pores on pure aluminum are smaller, with diameters
~1 microns and a relatively high density." and similar statements: you need to be more focused in
stating these data: mean values, errors? From which these values were extracted? (distributions
from SEM images?)
5) Some more focused discussions on the Al-Si phase diagram could help the reader.
6) What about the reliability of the oxide coatings for specific applications? In this sense, the
defects are crucial but the authors discussions about defects is a little bit too qualitative and
general.

“Influence of silicon on growth mechanism of MAO coating on cast Al-Si alloy” by Yu et al shows
some new insight for the MAO method. I think the following should be considered for revising
the manuscript.
1. In line 50 page 1, the author claimed that “high silicon content of the substrate has no adverse
influence on the structure and properties of the MAO coating on the ZL109 alloy”. However, the
morphology of Al-Si alloy is quite different from that of the pure aluminum observed by SEM.
Besides, the author attributed high hardness of the MAO coating to the formation of the <U+03B3>-Al2O3
in the coating. Does the coating containing more<U+03B3>-Al2O3 have higher hardness? The author
should give more details about the silicon content on the structure and properties of the coatings.
2. The adhesive strength of the coating was evaluated by the friction-load curve. The more
convictive proofs should be listed, such as the ASTM D3359 standard protocol.

Appendix A
Response to Reviewer Comments
This manuscript was originally submitted to Royal society open science and 2 sets of
Reviewer Comments were received. We thank the reviewers for their highly valuable
comments and suggestions made for this manuscript. The manuscript has been revised
accordingly and our point-by-point responses are provided below. All changes made
are highlighted in yellow in the revised manuscript.
Referee: 1
The manuscript "Influence of silicon on growth mechanism of MAO coating on cast
Al-Si alloy" reports about the preparation of oxide coatings, with a thickness of 15-18
microns, on ZL109 Al-Si alloy and by using the Micro-arc oxidation (MAO)
technique. The authors cross several experimental analysis (XRD, GIXD, SEM and
EPMA) for a complete morphological, structural and elemental analysis of the
samples and for the connection of these characteristics with the fabrication process
parameters.
From a general point of view, the manuscript is interesting and clear. The results are
well supported by the experimental data and the discussions are, in general, reliable
and well-founded on general principles.
So, in principle, the manuscript is suitable for publication, but requires, before
publication, some revisions as noted:
1) The authors talk about TEM (transmission electron microscopy) analysis. Perhaps
this is a mistake and they refer to SEM (scanning electron microscopy) analysis,
instead.
Our Response: We are so sorry to make such mistakes. We indeed refer to SEM
(scanning electron microscopy) analysis instead of TEM (transmission electron
microscopy) analysis. We have corrected the mistake which was highlighted on Pg 1,
Line 45.
2) Several points need to be quantified. As examples:
a) all the extracted experimental data should be accompained by the corresponding
errors.
Our Response: We added the corresponding errors of hardness, adhesive strength and
diameter of pores.
b) "Very few P is found in the coating, which shows that the electrolyte has little
effect on the coating composition.". Please, quantify. And similar statements without
explicit quantification.
Our Response: We reorganized the expression to make this clearer on Pg 3, Line
47-48 “Figure 3 (d) shows that the coatings on the Al-Si alloy are mainly composed of
Al, O and Si with trace amount of P, which is consistent with the XRD analysis.”
Furthermore, the acquisition rate of P element shown in figure 3 quantified the
amount of P element. We revised figure 3 (d) to make this clearer.
3) "The average roughness (Ra) of the substrate is 1 micron". What is the analysis
from which this information was extracted? Typically, AFM analysis are used for
quantify surface roughness (see, as examples: Superlattices and Microstructures 113,
430 (2018); Nanoscale Research Letters 6, 112 (2011)). Please, comment.
Our Response: We changed the manuscript to “Rectangular samples (12×8×4mm3)
were ground using 1000# SiC paper, based on our experience, this will normally
deliver an average roughness of around 1 micron.” In addition, the precise roughness
of the substrate wouldn’t influence the MAO treatment too much.
4) "The pores on the Al-Si alloy are larger, with diameters in the range of 3-6 microns
and a low density; while the pores on pure aluminum are smaller, with diameters ~1
microns and a relatively high density." and similar statements: you need to be more
focused in stating these data: mean values, errors? From which these values were
extracted? (distributions from SEM images?)
Our Response: We remeasured the diameters of the pores and changed the sentence
into “The pores on the Al-Si alloy are larger, with diameters in the range of
3.61±1.31µm and a low density; while the pores on pure aluminum are smaller, with
diameters of 1.06±0.47µm and a relatively high density. The diameters of pores are
measured from surface micrographs of MAO coatings.”
5) Some more focused discussions on the Al-Si phase diagram could help the reader.
Our Response: We added the contents of Al-Si phase diagram and quoted some
articles to help understanding on Pg 3, Line 6-9. And we added Al-Si phase diagram
in Figure 1.
6) What about the reliability of the oxide coatings for specific applications? In this
sense, the defects are crucial but the authors discussions about defects is a little bit too
qualitative and general.
Our Response: The defects of the oxide coatings mainly attributed to the pores, and
the pores of the oxide coatings can be sealed. We quoted some articles to prove on Pg
3, Line 27-30. The exceptional hardness and adhesive strength ensured the reliability
of the oxide coatings for specific applications.

“Influence of silicon on growth mechanism of MAO coating on cast Al-Si alloy” by
Yu et al shows some new insight for the MAO method. I think the following should
be considered for revising the manuscript.
1. In line 50 page 1, the author claimed that “high silicon content of the substrate
has no adverse influence on the structure and properties of the MAO coating on the
ZL109 alloy”. However, the morphology of Al-Si alloy is quite different from that of
the pure aluminum observed by SEM. Besides, the author attributed high hardness of
the MAO coating to the formation of the <U+03B3>-Al2O3 in the coating. Does the coating
containing more <U+03B3>-Al2O3 have higher hardness? The author should give more details
about the silicon content on the structure and properties of the coatings.
Our Response: We added the influence of silicon content on the structure and
properties of the coatings on Pg 3, Line 51-56 and Pg 4, Line 1-4. We quoted some
articles to demonstrate. ZL109 alloys exhibit much better mechanical properties than
pure aluminum, the addition of Si leads to the formation of SiO2 or Al2SiO5 in MAO
coatings which wouldn’t have adverse influence on the properties of MAO coatings.
2. The adhesive strength of the coating was evaluated by the friction-load curve.
The more convictive proofs should be listed, such as the ASTM D3359 standard
protocol.
Our Response: We added ASTM D3359-17 standard test methods for rating adhesion
by tape test on Pg 1, Line 46-47;Pg 2, Line 48-49; Pg 4, Line 6-7 and Line 15-23, in
addition, we added figure 5 to illustrate the results.
