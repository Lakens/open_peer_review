Title: CO2 induced ocean acidification does not affect individual or group behavior in a
temperate damselfish
Overview: The study tested the effect of constant and oscillating pH conditions on a temperate
damselfish that lives within the Californian kelp forests. Due to the photosynthetic activity of the
kelp bed, as well as consistent upwelling events, this damselfish species is regularly exposed to
altered pH conditions. Experiments were conducting in both the summer and winter seasons to
account for any seasonal difference and light levels were also altered. No significant effects on
any of the behavioral parameters tested were found. While the study is interesting in the tests
that were conducted, it is not very well written. The study goes into a lot of detail on the
physiological impairments expected under ocean acidification exposure, GABA A impacts etc.
However the tests that were run were all behavioral. The introduction therefore needs to be
reworked to set the stage for the tests that were actually conducted.
Issues to be addressed: There are a few issues with the study that are unclear. First the
replication within the research is not well noted. Also with a study testing the effects of shoaling
it is important to know if the fish were familiar with one another prior to the experiment (i.e.
were they collected from the same group), or even within the experiment (were the shoals made
of fish from the same experimental tank?), all of these could impact their response towards one
another. Also the age of the fish and the timing of the collection are potential issues. The fish are
listed as juveniles, how old is a juvenile and were the fish collected in January from the same
cohort of fish used in September?
Specific Issues to Address:
Line 64-67: Edit sentence for clarity.
Line 79-83: Break the sentence up it is too long.
Line 85: Citation is listed incorrectly according to journal requirements
Line 92-93: last part of the sentence is missing a word
Line 138: I thought I have read a study by Manassa and McCormick on shoaling and OA.
Line 163: use a lower case c for compare.
Line 167: how old is juvenile? Do these recruit year round? Otherwise there is the potential
variable of time the impacts the January or September collection as one would be considerably
older if recruitment is a one time seasonal event.
Line 212: How many replicate group testings were there? 3 tanks per treatment seems low with
the risk of pseudo replication
Line 241: No habituation period for the dark/light tested experiment?
Line 246: explain the rationale behind the exposure times, one is a week, this one is 11 days, why?
Line 246: again, no habituation period?

This work by Kwan and colleagues investigates the effects of CO2 induced seawater acidification
on the behavior of a marine teleost from a temperate upwelling habitat.
In their study the authors specifically address the effects of constant v.s. fluctuating acidification
scenarios to mimic natural conditions in the field predicted for the near-future. Seasonal (i.e
temperature) affects were tested by performing the experiments with specimens collected in
January and September. By testing light/dark preferences and shoaling behavior the authors
conclude that these parameters are not affected by pH manipulations, while seasonal differences
were observed.
The manuscript is well written and structured, although some sections of the introduction are too
long by extensively introducing potential physiological reasons for behavioral defects in fish that
are speculative and which remain unanswered in this work. Along these lines it would be very
interesting to see if extracellular acid-base regulatory characteristics (e.g. HCO3- buffering and Cl
– loss) of this species may explain its relative robustness to acidified conditions. Since no effect
was observed among the pH treatments applied in this work it would be very helpful to test if
behavioral defects occur at lower pH values. Although I see that this work was conducted in the
frame of near future ocean acidification scenarios (-0.4 pH units), the determination of potential
threshold values (probably beyond those predicted until the end of the century) will provide an
important step towards a better understanding regarding species-specific responses. This work
importantly demonstrates that effects of CO2-induced seawater acidification on behavioral
patterns in teleost fish are species-specific. However, additional experiments are suggested that
may help to strengthen this manuscript and that will help to gain insights into the mechanistic
basis of behavioral defects under high CO2 conditions.
Specific comments
L38: “tolerant” is too general. I would stay close to the data presented here, and specifically state
that important behavioral patterns were unaffected by OA in this species
Introduction: Several paragraphs in this section can be shortened.
1. Reduce OA introduction to the main messages
2. L71-88: This paragraph explaining the mechanism of the GABA/GABAA receptor
system can be condensed. Extensive description of the system, and its connection to acid-base
disturbances suggests, that this work will contribute to the mechanisms how seawater
acidification affects this neurological system. This paragraph in its full length would make more
sense in the case the authors decide to add some experiments characterizing the extracellular
acid-base regulatory parameters in this species upon low pH exposure.
3. L124-146This paragraph on the shoaling behavior can be significantly condensed.
Material and Methods
I cannot find any information in the material and methods section describing the duration of low
pH exposure. This is essential, since extracellular pH regulation and the potential subsequent
effects on neurotransmitter function are a time-dependent process.
4
Results
Is it possible to provide a graph that shows the diurnal pH(pCO2) oscillations and constant pH
levels over the experimental period? This would be very helpful to follow the changes in the
experimental system seen by the animals.
It would be very helpful to see if treatment with different doses of a GABAA antagonist can
evoke behavioral changes to test for the sensitivity of the GABA/GABAA receptor system in this
species.
Line 323: “…are resilient to…” It remains unknown how this species will respond to changes in
ocean pH. Here only near-future acidification scenarios demonstrated no effect on behavioral
patterns
Line 361-363: “…blacksmiths may have different acid-base regulatory capabilities…” this is fairly
easy to test, and would provide important information regarding the link between extracellular
pH regulation and GABA receptor functioning. Alternatively, is there any literature available for
this species demonstrating the acid-base compensatory response of this species (e.g. HCO3-
accumulation and compensation of acidosis).

This study tested the effects of CO2-induced ocean acidification on individual anxiety levels and
group behaviour in a temperate damselfish. Contrary to many previous studies, there was no
apparent effect of elevated CO2 on the three behavioural traits measured. An important inclusion
in this study is a day-night cycling CO2 treatment that mimics pCO2/pH variation in the natural
habitat. This is one of the first studies to incorporate this important treatment for fish from
variable CO2 habitats. I am aware of other studies using cycling CO2 treatments for coral reef
fishes, but this is the first study I have seen using a cycling treatment in temperate water fishes.
The authors conclude that the absence of any behavioural effects of elevated CO2 (at least for the
3 behaviours measured) may be due to the study species exhibiting a high tolerance to CO2 levels
that it naturally experiences within the kelp habitat. The study is important and the experiments
have been conducted to a high technical standard. The behavioural test are appropriate and well
justified. The analysis and interpretation is also appropriate. The ms is well written and easy to
follow. I especially commend the authors on a very balanced and scholarly approach to reporting
their non-significant results and not trying to over-interpret the lack of effects. They have framed
their results in a sensible manner that is useful for others investigating the effects of elevated CO2
on marine fish physiology and behaviour. I have just a few relatively minor comments and
suggestions.
1. The average pCO2 of the controls seems very high at between 530-587 uatm. Some justification
of this level in relation to the average conditions the fish experience in nature is required,
especially as the top level is approaching the range at which some previous studies have started
to detect behavioural effects (e.g. Simpson et al 2011 for auditory responses).
2. The sample size is very low (N=6) for the shoaling and novel object tests. While there doesn’t
seem to be any obvious trends in the data, other than perhaps for time near wall (an indicator of
anxiety) in the shoaling test, it would still be worth considering the statistical power to detect an
effect.

3. It was not clear if each fish was used just once, or used in multiple tests. Please clarify.
4. Line 68. You could add Heinrich et al ICES J Mar Sci as another study that found no
behavioural effects, possibly because the species studies has evolved a tolerance to high CO2 in
its habitat.

CO2 -induced ocean acidification does not affect individual or group behaviour in a temperate
damselfish
OVERVIEW
This manuscript presents interesting data from a study that has attempted to advance our
knowledge of the potential impacts of ocean acidification on fish, by exploring two relatively
novel aspects – namely the role of fluctuating CO2/pH conditions, together with the variability
in response between seasons. The study also has value in presenting data on group (and
individual) behaviour in a shoaling fish species, whereas most previous studies have focused
only on individual behavioural responses to OA conditions.
The manuscript describes a carefully conducted study in which CO2/pH conditions have been
well controlled and confirmed by high quality water carbonate chemistry analysis. The behaviour
9
of blacksmith (a temperate damselfish collected from drifting kelp paddies in California) has been
studied using methodologies that are established for work on fish, and allow the quantification of
anxiety-related behaviours. Specifically the response of individuals to a choice of light/dark
areas, and the shoaling behaviour of small groups (of 5 fish) as well as their response to a novel
object, were recorded.
The data show that CO2/pH (either constant or diurnally fluctuating) does not affect the
individual and group behaviours studied, but season/temperature does affect individual
responses in the light/dark choice test. These findings are significant in that they point towards
season as another influential factor in interpreting behavioural responses in fish, and also
highlight the potential for variability between species/niches in their sensitivity to CO2.
Although this may not be that much of a surprise to physiologists and ecologists, it is
nevertheless important to accumulate data that expand our understanding of organismal
responses to CO2 to help interpret and predict how ecosystems may respond to future climate
change.
MAJOR COMMENTS
1) CLARITY OF DATA PRESENTED - The date are presented in three figures. Figure 1 clearly
shows and describes data from the summer and winter experiments. However, figures 2 and 3
and their legends do not explicitly state that data are only from one season, or which season this
is. From the description in the Methods it would appear that these data are for the summer
(September) experiments. However, this needs to be made explicitly clear in both the main text
and the figures and their legends.
2) SEASON CAUGHT v. SEASON OF EXPERIMENT – The Methods section (l.148-156) states
that fish were collected in two batches from the wild, at intervals 9 months apart. However, it is
not clear whether these fish were pooled and used in the same experiments or not. This is
important, as it could influence the interpretation of the data, in particular whether differences
due to temperature/season are purely due to the temperature/season of the experiments, or
whether the temperature/season that fish were collected from could influence this. Also, the
duration of the laboratory acclimation period (post-collection) would be different in these two
collected batches. Could this affect responses?
One line in the Discussion (line 314-315) specifically mentions that “the season in which
blacksmiths were caught and tested did affect individual blacksmith behaviour; which warrants
further investigation”. However, from the current description of the Methods it is not clear how
both the “caught” and “tested” seasonal effect are determined.
MINOR COMMENTS
l.31 – Was temperature actually recorded to a precision of 0.01 degrees C? If not, then I suggest
reporting data only to 0.1 degrees C. Same issue applies to the pCO2 data reported later on.
l.34 – It is an overstatement to say “suggesting blacksmith are tolerant to projected future OA
conditions”. Only 3 related behavioural variables were tested, which on their own cannot allow
this grand conclusion. I suggest toning this down to reflect tolerance regarding these particular
behaviours only.
l.46 – Atmospheric CO2 was previously (pre-industrially) nearer 280 than 300 uatm.
l.50-51 – a “further CO2 increase of 800 uatm…” would raise CO2 from 400 to 1200 uatm. This
contradicts the opening line of the Abstract which suggests 1,000 uatm.
l.64: Starting this sentence with “Similarly” is not really appropriate, as the effect of gabazine
described is essentially opposite to that described in the previous sentence. To fully understand
10
these two sentences requires the knowledge of ionic gradient changes between control and OA
conditions, which has not been explained yet.
l.89 – Rather than saying OA alters the function of GABA-A receptors, perhaps it is a more
complete description to say that OA alters the downstream impact of GABA-A receptors being
activated. The receptors themselves may not change, and the current theory only suggests that
the ionic gradients between intra- and extra-cellular compartments are changed, resulting in
depolarisation under OA conditions, rather than hyperpolarisation under control conditions.
l.92 – “elevated CO2-induced pH levels” could be misread to mean elevated pH levels. Suggest
re-wording to avoid potential confusion.
l.100 – Numbers and units should always be separated by a space (i.e., 7 m and 17 m).
l.102 – Should be “Time series data…. have also…” not “has”. Data are plural.
l.137 – Should be “within 15 m of surface” not “from surface”.
l.153 – Fish were acclimated for “at least 30 days”, but some may have been acclimate for much
longer (almost a year), depending on how the collected batches of fish were used. This issue
needs further description to more explicitly explain the use of collected fish and their provenance.
l.158 – How was the selection made “random”. If this is down to the user netting fish ad hoc, then
it is probably not really random, as this usually selects the boldest or slowest fish that are most
easily caught.
l.200 – Suggest changing to “…captured by a FireWire…”
l.214 – How long was food withheld prior to test? This is relevant to determine whether this is
long enough for the gut to be empty, and how hungry the fish would be (which could influence
behaviour).
l.325 – Should be “blood acid-base regulation”, not “A-B regulation”.
l.395-396 – I think it is interpreting too far to say that blacksmith will be a “winner” species
regarding future OA effects, based only on these anxiety-related behaviours. This needs to be
toned down and made specific to these behaviours only.
Figure 2 and 3 legends or figures do not state what season these data are for.

Comments to the Author(s)
This study tested the effects of CO2-induced ocean acidification on individual anxiety levels and
group behaviour in a temperate damselfish. Contrary to many previous studies, there was no
apparent effect of elevated CO2 on the three behavioural traits measured. An important inclusion
in this study is a day-night cycling CO2 treatment that mimics pCO2/pH variation in the natural
habitat. This is one of the first studies to incorporate this important treatment for fish from
variable CO2 habitats. I am aware of other studies using cycling CO2 treatments for coral reef
fishes, but this is the first study I have seen using a cycling treatment in temperate water fishes.
The authors conclude that the absence of any behavioural effects of elevated CO2 (at least for the
3 behaviours measured) may be due to the study species exhibiting a high tolerance to CO2 levels
that it naturally experiences within the kelp habitat. The study is important and the experiments
have been conducted to a high technical standard. The behavioural test are appropriate and well
justified. The analysis and interpretation is also appropriate. The ms is well written and easy to
follow. I especially commend the authors on a very balanced and scholarly approach to reporting
their non-significant results and not trying to over-interpret the lack of effects. They have framed
their results in a sensible manner that is useful for others investigating the effects of elevated CO2
on marine fish physiology and behaviour. I have just a few relatively minor comments and
suggestions.
1. The average pCO2 of the controls seems very high at between 530-587 uatm. Some justification
of this level in relation to the average conditions the fish experience in nature is required,
especially as the top level is approaching the range at which some previous studies have started
to detect behavioural effects (e.g. Simpson et al 2011 for auditory responses).
2. The sample size is very low (N=6) for the shoaling and novel object tests. While there doesn’t
seem to be any obvious trends in the data, other than perhaps for time near wall (an indicator of
anxiety) in the shoaling test, it would still be worth considering the statistical power to detect an
effect.
3. It was not clear if each fish was used just once, or used in multiple tests. Please clarify.
4. Line 68. You could add Heinrich et al ICES J Mar Sci as another study that found no
behavioural effects, possibly because the species studies has evolved a tolerance to high CO2 in
its habitat.
5. Line 75. potentiated by...
6. Spell out acid-base.
7. Tables 1 & 2. It is necessary to state the pH scale used and add units of measure for TA.

CO2 -induced ocean acidification does not affect individual or group behaviour in a temperate
damselfish
OVERVIEW
This manuscript presents interesting data from a study that has attempted to advance our
knowledge of the potential impacts of ocean acidification on fish, by exploring two relatively
14
novel aspects – namely the role of fluctuating CO2/pH conditions, together with the variability
in response between seasons. The study also has value in presenting data on group (and
individual) behaviour in a shoaling fish species, whereas most previous studies have focused
only on individual behavioural responses to OA conditions.
The manuscript describes a carefully conducted study in which CO2/pH conditions have been
well controlled and confirmed by high quality water carbonate chemistry analysis. The behaviour
of blacksmith (a temperate damselfish collected from drifting kelp paddies in California) has been
studied using methodologies that are established for work on fish, and allow the quantification of
anxiety-related behaviours. Specifically the response of individuals to a choice of light/dark
areas, and the shoaling behaviour of small groups (of 5 fish) as well as their response to a novel
object, were recorded.
The data show that CO2/pH (either constant or diurnally fluctuating) does not affect the
individual and group behaviours studied, but season/temperature does affect individual
responses in the light/dark choice test. These findings are significant in that they point towards
season as another influential factor in interpreting behavioural responses in fish, and also
highlight the potential for variability between species/niches in their sensitivity to CO2.
Although this may not be that much of a surprise to physiologists and ecologists, it is
nevertheless important to accumulate data that expand our understanding of organismal
responses to CO2 to help interpret and predict how ecosystems may respond to future climate
change.
MAJOR COMMENTS
1) CLARITY OF DATA PRESENTED - The date are presented in three figures. Figure 1 clearly
shows and describes data from the summer and winter experiments. However, figures 2 and 3
and their legends do not explicitly state that data are only from one season, or which season this
is. From the description in the Methods it would appear that these data are for the summer
(September) experiments. However, this needs to be made explicitly clear in both the main text
and the figures and their legends.
2) SEASON CAUGHT v. SEASON OF EXPERIMENT – The Methods section (l.148-156) states
that fish were collected in two batches from the wild, at intervals 9 months apart. However, it is
not clear whether these fish were pooled and used in the same experiments or not. This is
important, as it could influence the interpretation of the data, in particular whether differences
due to temperature/season are purely due to the temperature/season of the experiments, or
whether the temperature/season that fish were collected from could influence this. Also, the
duration of the laboratory acclimation period (post-collection) would be different in these two
collected batches. Could this affect responses?
One line in the Discussion (line 314-315) specifically mentions that “the season in which
blacksmiths were caught and tested did affect individual blacksmith behaviour; which warrants
further investigation”. However, from the current description of the Methods it is not clear how
both the “caught” and “tested” seasonal effect are determined.
MINOR COMMENTS
l.31 – Was temperature actually recorded to a precision of 0.01 degrees C? If not, then I suggest
reporting data only to 0.1 degrees C. Same issue applies to the pCO2 data reported later on.
l.34 – It is an overstatement to say “suggesting blacksmith are tolerant to projected future OA
conditions”. Only 3 related behavioural variables were tested, which on their own cannot allow
this grand conclusion. I suggest toning this down to reflect tolerance regarding these particular
behaviours only.
l.46 – Atmospheric CO2 was previously (pre-industrially) nearer 280 than 300 uatm.
15
l.50-51 – a “further CO2 increase of 800 uatm…” would raise CO2 from 400 to 1200 uatm. This
contradicts the opening line of the Abstract which suggests 1,000 uatm.
l.64: Starting this sentence with “Similarly” is not really appropriate, as the effect of gabazine
described is essentially opposite to that described in the previous sentence. To fully understand
these two sentences requires the knowledge of ionic gradient changes between control and OA
conditions, which has not been explained yet.
l.89 – Rather than saying OA alters the function of GABA-A receptors, perhaps it is a more
complete description to say that OA alters the downstream impact of GABA-A receptors being
activated. The receptors themselves may not change, and the current theory only suggests that
the ionic gradients between intra- and extra-cellular compartments are changed, resulting in
depolarisation under OA conditions, rather than hyperpolarisation under control conditions.
l.92 – “elevated CO2-induced pH levels” could be misread to mean elevated pH levels. Suggest
re-wording to avoid potential confusion.
l.100 – Numbers and units should always be separated by a space (i.e., 7 m and 17 m).
l.102 – Should be “Time series data…. have also…” not “has”. Data are plural.
l.137 – Should be “within 15 m of surface” not “from surface”.
l.153 – Fish were acclimated for “at least 30 days”, but some may have been acclimate for much
longer (almost a year), depending on how the collected batches of fish were used. This issue
needs further description to more explicitly explain the use of collected fish and their provenance.
l.158 – How was the selection made “random”. If this is down to the user netting fish ad hoc, then
it is probably not really random, as this usually selects the boldest or slowest fish that are most
easily caught.
l.200 – Suggest changing to “…captured by a FireWire…”
l.214 – How long was food withheld prior to test? This is relevant to determine whether this is
long enough for the gut to be empty, and how hungry the fish would be (which could influence
behaviour).
l.325 – Should be “blood acid-base regulation”, not “A-B regulation”.
l.395-396 – I think it is interpreting too far to say that blacksmith will be a “winner” species
regarding future OA effects, based only on these anxiety-related behaviours. This needs to be
toned down and made specific to these behaviours only.
Figure 2 and 3 legends or figures do not state what season these data are for.

Title: CO2 induced ocean acidification does not affect individual or group behavior in a temperate
damselfish
1) Overview: The study tested the effect of constant and oscillating pH conditions on a temperate
damselfish that lives within the Californian kelp forests. Due to the photosynthetic activity of the kelp
bed, as well as consistent upwelling events, this damselfish species is regularly exposed to altered pH
conditions. Experiments were conducting in both the summer and winter seasons to account for any
seasonal difference and light levels were also altered. No significant effects on any of the behavioral
parameters tested were found. While the study is interesting in the tests that were conducted, it is not
very well written.
Answer=we have addressed all of the suggestions from reviewers 1 and 2 and hope our new version is
better written.
2) The study goes into a lot of detail on the physiological impairments expected under ocean
acidification exposure, GABA A impacts etc. However the tests that were run were all behavioral. The
introduction therefore needs to be reworked to set the stage for the tests that were actually conducted.
A=Thank you for this suggestion. We have deleted most sections on physiology/GABA-A receptors in the
Introduction and Discussion.
3) Issues to be addressed: There are a few issues with the study that are unclear. First the replication
within the research is not well noted.
A=Lines 177 to 185 explain replication:
“Seawater was continuously pumped from the ocean into the header tanks, where the IKS Aquastar
system (Karlsbad, Germany) monitored and recorded the temperature and pH values as well as
manipulated the pH by bubbling CO2 gas into the three header tanks (Supplementary Figure 1). Each
header tank supplied water to three 20-liter experimental tanks (0.3 liters min-1) housing six
blacksmiths each, and was covered with a transparent fiberglass lid to limit atmospheric exposure and
slow CO2 degassing. Experimental tanks were randomly arranged and located on a shelf directly below
the header tanks (see more details in Data Analyses).”
4) Also with a study testing the effects of shoaling it is important to know if the fish were familiar with
one another prior to the experiment (i.e. were they collected from the same group), or even within the
experiment (were the shoals made of fish from the same experimental tank?), all of these could impact
their response towards one another.
A=Fish were caught and habituated together for at least a month prior to the experiment (explained in
line 153).
5) Also the age of the fish and the timing of the collection are potential issues. The fish are listed as
juveniles, how old is a juvenile and were the fish collected in January from the same cohort of fish used
in September?
A=To date there are only a few papers that have aged blacksmith, two of them are cited in the
manuscript [Limbaugh (1964) and Love (2011)]. Both sources state that juvenile blacksmiths are blue-
and-yellow, and all of our fish were those colours. Furthermore, Love (2011) also states that blacksmiths
mature around 14cm, which corresponds to ~2 years old. All of our blacksmiths were young-of-the-year
(less than 1 year old), but because they were caught from the wild their exact age is unknown.
However, as stated in Methods, length and weight of each individual fish was consistent with being
juveniles (Lines 159- 164). The fish from January and September were caught at different times and
therefore not from the same cohort, but were caught in the same geographical location. Rather than
being a limitation, we consider it is a strength of our study because CO2/pH conditions had the same
(lack of) effect on both sets of fish. Furthermore, the potential effect of cohort or other unidentified
variables is discussed in detail.
Specific Issues to Address:
6) Line 64-67: Edit sentence for clarity.
A=Thank you. Lines 64 – 65 now reads “Similarly, the application of gabazine induced anxiety-like
behaviour in control fish to levels similar to fish exposed to OA conditions [14].”
7) Line 79-83: Break the sentence up it is too long.
A=Corrected.
8) Line 85: Citation is listed incorrectly according to journal requirements
A=Fixed, thank you.
9) Line 92-93: last part of the sentence is missing a word
A= this sentence has been modified.
10) Line 138: I thought I have read a study by Manassa and McCormick on shoaling and OA.
A=we looked but were unable to find a paper by Manassa and McCormick on shoaling and OA. However,
two studies (Nadler et al., 2016 and Lopes et al., 2017) were published after our first submission. We
now discuss these papers in the revised manuscript.
12) Line 163: use a lower case c for compare.
A=This has been fixed, thank you.
13) Line 167: how old is juvenile? Do these recruit year round? Otherwise there is the potential variable
of time the impacts the January or September collection as one would be considerably older if
recruitment is a one time seasonal event.
A=We agree that time is an interesting variable which is why we have made a point of mentioning
potential seasonal variability in behaviour between the January and September control groups. However,
at both time points (January and September) there were still no effects of elevated pCO2 or fluctuating
pCO2 on behaviour (please see our answer to point #5).
14) Line 212: How many replicate group testings were there? 3 tanks per treatment seems low with the
risk of pseudo replication
A= The group behaviour experiment contained 6 replicate groups (six different shoals per treatment,
with each shoal having 5 blacksmith). This is explained in lines 242, 294, 301, and now we also included
it in the figure legends.
15) Line 241: No habituation period for the dark/light tested experiment?
A=As explained in lines 79-83, the light/dark test is based on the opposing tendencies an organism has
to explore a new environment versus hiding. Therefore, an habituation period would contradict the basic
concept of this test (please note the light/dark test is routinely used in neurobiology studies with
mammals as well as fish -see references listed in the manuscript).
16) Line 246: explain the rationale behind the exposure times, one is a week, this one is 11 days, why?
A=seven days was chosen for individual behavioural testing (both in January and September) to match
previous studies, especially our study on rockfish. Furthermore, OA-dependent behavioural changes are
seen as early as three days. Group behaviour was tested only in September, and took place after 11
days of OA-exposure. We decided to wait 4 days between individual and group behavioural testing to
minimize handling stress.
17) Line 246: again, no habituation period?
A=Please see our response to point #15.

Comments to the Author(s)
This work by Kwan and colleagues investigates the effects of CO2 induced seawater acidification on the
behavior of a marine teleost from a temperate upwelling habitat.
In their study the authors specifically address the effects of constant v.s. fluctuating acidification
scenarios to mimic natural conditions in the field predicted for the near-future. Seasonal (i.e
temperature) affects were tested by performing the experiments with specimens collected in January
and September. By testing light/dark preferences and shoaling behavior the authors conclude that these
parameters are not affected by pH manipulations, while seasonal differences were observed.
The manuscript is well written and structured, although some sections of the introduction are too long
by extensively introducing potential physiological reasons for behavioral defects in fish that are
speculative and which remain unanswered in this work. Along these lines it would be very interesting to
see if extracellular acid-base regulatory characteristics (e.g. HCO3- buffering and Cl – loss) of this
species may explain its relative robustness to acidified conditions. Since no effect was observed among
the pH treatments applied in this work it would be very helpful to test if behavioral defects occur at
lower pH values. Although I see that this work was conducted in the frame of near future ocean
acidification scenarios (-0.4 pH units), the determination of potential threshold values (probably beyond
those predicted until the end of the century) will provide an important step towards a better
understanding regarding species-specific responses. This work importantly demonstrates that effects of
CO2-induced seawater acidification on behavioral patterns in teleost fish are species-specific. However,
additional experiments are suggested that may help to strengthen this manuscript and that will help to
gain insights into the mechanistic basis of behavioral defects under high CO2 conditions.
A=thank you for your comments. We agree our original manuscript had a few highly speculative sections
on the potential physiological mechanisms, and we have largely deleted those sections in the revised
manuscript. We also agree that the proposed experiments would be valuable and we will consider them
for future research.
Regarding testing lower pH/higher CO2 values, we consider it a low priority question that could be
addressed eventually in future studies.
As you mention, one of the strengths of our study is that it identified differential responses between
blacksmith and rockfish using the same conditions and methods.
Specific comments
1) L38: “tolerant” is too general. I would stay close to the data presented here, and specifically state
that important behavioral patterns were unaffected by OA in this species.
A= we understand the point raised by this referee, and that is why the sentence reads “SUGGESTING
blacksmiths are tolerant to projected future OA conditions”. The caveats are explained in detail
throughout the manuscript (this is equivalent to every study that reports a species is susceptible to OA
based on a specific laboratory test that may or may not be relevant to the the real world).
2) Introduction: Several paragraphs in this section can be shortened.
1. Reduce OA introduction to the main messages
A=We have reorganized and shortened the Introduction significantly.
2. L71-88: This paragraph explaining the mechanism of the GABA/GABAA receptor system can be
condensed. Extensive description of the system, and its connection to acid-base disturbances suggests,
that this work will contribute to the mechanisms how seawater acidification affects this neurological
system. This paragraph in its full length would make more sense in the case the authors decide to add
some experiments characterizing the extracellular acid-base regulatory parameters in this species upon
low pH exposure.
A=We agree and have considerably shortened this paragraph as well as all other sections on potential
neurological mechanisms throughout the manuscript.
3. L124-146 This paragraph on the shoaling behavior can be significantly condensed.
A=We have condensed part of this paragraph, however, we feel it is important to introduce the concept
of shoaling and explain its relationship with anxiety and the behavioural tests used in this study because
it explains why we used the shoaling test in this study.
Material and Methods
4) I cannot find any information in the material and methods section describing the duration of low pH
exposure. This is essential, since extracellular pH regulation and the potential subsequent effects on
neurotransmitter function are a time-dependent process.
A=The referee is partially correct; that information was present but it was not readily evident. The
revised version describes the exposure durations in lines 173-176, 230-232, and 237-239. Thank you for
this comment.
Results
5) Is it possible to provide a graph that shows the diurnal pH(pCO2) oscillations and constant pH levels
over the experimental period? This would be very helpful to follow the changes in the experimental
system seen by the animals.
A=Yes, the requested graph was already provided as Supplementary figure 1.
6) It would be very helpful to see if treatment with different doses of a GABAA antagonist can evoke
behavioral changes to test for the sensitivity of the GABA/GABAA receptor system in this species.
A=Since we did not see any affect of elevated CO2 in either of our tests we did not apply any GABA-A
antagonists, which is typically done in other OA studies showing ‘reversal’ of behavioural changes with
gabazine. We agree that future research could use pharmacology to attempt to tease out whether
GABA-A receptors are mechanistically involved – ideally when there is an effect of elevated CO2.
7) Line 323: “…are resilient to…” It remains unknown how this species will respond to changes in ocean
pH. Here only near-future acidification scenarios demonstrated no effect on behavioral patterns
The sentence now reads, “… suggesting blacksmiths are resilient to environmental CO2/pH variability
and to and to near-future OA scenarios, at least in relation to the parameters tested.” (Now lines 315 –
316) (please note we replaced “the predicted future OA” for “near-future OA scenarios” and added “at
least in relation to the parameters tested”).
8) Line 361-363: “…blacksmiths may have different acid-base regulatory capabilities…” this is fairly easy
to test, and would provide important information regarding the link between extracellular pH regulation
and GABA receptor functioning.
A=We agree that characterizing acid/base regulatory capabilities would provide important information.
However, this is definitively not easy to test. For example, the mechanisms of acid/base regulation
under normal and OA-relevant conditions have not been established for any marine fish from any
developmental stage. Similarly, measuring blood acid/base and ionic concentrations (e.g. chloride) is
extremely challenging in small fish. Furthermore, the relevant parameters must be measured in
cerebrospinal fluid and brain interstitial fluid (and not blood plasma), and neuron cytoplasm. These
complications would take too long to explain and would deviate attention away from the main point of
the current study. If the referee is interested in this topic, Tresguerres and Hamilton have recently
written a review article that focuses on these (and other) aspects of fish acid/base regulation,
neurobiology and behaviour, which has recently been accepted in the Journal of Experimental Biology
and will be published shortly.
9) Alternatively, is there any literature available for this species demonstrating the acid-base
compensatory response of this species (e.g. HCO3- accumulation and compensation of acidosis).
A=No, unfortunately there are no published studies about this topic in this species (and very few in
general, please see our answer above).

Reviewer 3
1. The average pCO2 of the controls seems very high at between 530-587 uatm. Some justification of
this level in relation to the average conditions the fish experience in nature is required, especially as the
top level is approaching the range at which some previous studies have started to detect behavioural
effects (e.g. Simpson et al 2011 for auditory responses).
A=This comment probably originates in the common and mistaken assumption that current “normal”
pCO2 levels are ~400 uatm throughout the ocean. However, ~400 uatm is believed to be the average
pCO2 of the open surface ocean and most coastal environments regularly experience higher pCO2
levels. For example, the area where blacksmith were caught, which is the same water that supplies the
Scripps experimental aquarium, typically has values between 500-600 uatm (and can be as high as
1000 uatm during upwelling events).
To address this comment, we have edited the text in Lines 175-181.
2. The sample size is very low (N=6) for the shoaling and novel object tests. While there doesn’t seem
to be any obvious trends in the data, other than perhaps for time near wall (an indicator of anxiety) in
the shoaling test, it would still be worth considering the statistical power to detect an effect.
A=These concerns are addressed in lines 327-340.
3. It was not clear if each fish was used just once, or used in multiple tests. Please clarify.
A=This information was added in lines 233-235 and 241.
4. Line 68. You could add Heinrich et al ICES J Mar Sci as another study that found no behavioural
effects, possibly because the species studies has evolved a tolerance to high CO2 in its habitat.
A=Sure why not. It is now added in line 68. We assume you refer to the following study?

5. Line 75. potentiated by...
A=Thank you, “by” was added in line 75.
6. Spell out acid-base.
A=Line 343 has been changed to acid-base.
7. Tables 1 & 2. It is necessary to state the pH scale used and add units of measure for TA.
A=This information has added in table 1.
Reviewer 4
1) CLARITY OF DATA PRESENTED - The date are presented in three figures. Figure 1 clearly shows and
describes data from the summer and winter experiments. However, figures 2 and 3 and their legends do
not explicitly state that data are only from one season, or which season this is. From the description in
the Methods it would appear that these data are for the summer (September) experiments. However,
this needs to be made explicitly clear in both the main text and the figures and their legends.
A=Thank you, this information has been added in lines 233-235 and 241 as well as in their respective
figure legends.
2) SEASON CAUGHT v. SEASON OF EXPERIMENT – The Methods section (l.148-156) states that fish
were collected in two batches from the wild, at intervals 9 months apart. However, it is not clear
whether these fish were pooled and used in the same experiments or not. This is important, as it could
influence the interpretation of the data, in particular whether differences due to temperature/season are
purely due to the temperature/season of the experiments, or whether the temperature/season that fish
were collected from could influence this. Also, the duration of the laboratory acclimation period (post-
collection) would be different in these two collected batches. Could this affect responses?
A=Thank you. The duration of laboratory acclimation period for both experiments were similar (~30
days). To clarify this concern, we modified lines 154-160, which now read “The initial behavioural
measurements were performed in January, 2015 (16.5 ± 0.0oC) on blacksmiths caught in December
2014. A subsequent set of individual behavioural measurements, as well as a set of group behavioural
measurements were performed in September, 2015 (23.1 ± 0.0 °C) on blacksmiths caught in August
2015”.
3) One line in the Discussion (line 314-315) specifically mentions that “the season in which blacksmiths
were caught and tested did affect individual blacksmith behaviour; which warrants further investigation”.
However, from the current description of the Methods it is not clear how both the “caught” and “tested”
seasonal effect are determined.
A=This point is answered by the previous response.
MINOR COMMENTS
l.31 – Was temperature actually recorded to a precision of 0.01 degrees C? If not, then I suggest
reporting data only to 0.1 degrees C. Same issue applies to the pCO2 data reported later on.
A= Thank you for bringing this to our attention, it has been fixed.
l.34 – It is an overstatement to say “suggesting blacksmith are tolerant to projected future OA
conditions”. Only 3 related behavioural variables were tested, which on their own cannot allow this
grand conclusion. I suggest toning this down to reflect tolerance regarding these particular behaviours
only.
A=We agree about the limitations of our study, and the caveats are discussed throughout the
manuscript at length. However, we disagree it is a ‘grand conclusion”, and we would like to point the
sentence is already toned down by the word “suggest” (as opposed to “indicate” or “demonstrate”).
Similarly, multiple other published papers include similar sentences to describe “negative” effects of OA
based on similar behavioural tests. For example, our previous study on rockfish which measured similar
behavioural variables and did find effects of OA-like treatments (Hamilton et al 2013) stated “These
results show that OA could severely alter rockfish behavior” (notice that here the conclusion was toned
down by the word “could”, and that we could list dozens of other studies with similar conclusions). For
the sake of balance and consistency, we prefer to leave the abstract (which reflects our opinion)
unchanged.
l.46 – Atmospheric CO2 was previously (pre-industrially) nearer 280 than 300 uatm.
A=Thank you, line 46 has been changed.
l.50-51 – a “further CO2 increase of 800 uatm…” would raise CO2 from 400 to 1200 uatm. This
contradicts the opening line of the Abstract which suggests 1,000 uatm.
A=Thank you. Line 19 has been adjusted to read “Open ocean surface CO2 levels are projected to reach
~800 µatm, and pH to decrease by ~0.3 units by the year 2100 due to anthropogenic CO2 emissions
and the subsequent process of ocean acidification (OA)”.
Line 51 has been adjusted to read “a further CO2 increase to ~800 µatm”.
l.64: Starting this sentence with “Similarly” is not really appropriate, as the effect of gabazine described
is essentially opposite to that described in the previous sentence. To fully understand these two
sentences requires the knowledge of ionic gradient changes between control and OA conditions, which
has not been explained yet.
A=“Similarly” was changed to “Additionally” in line 64.
l.89 – Rather than saying OA alters the function of GABA-A receptors, perhaps it is a more complete
description to say that OA alters the downstream impact of GABA-A receptors being activated. The
receptors themselves may not change, and the current theory only suggests that the ionic gradients
between intra- and extra-cellular compartments are changed, resulting in depolarisation under OA
conditions, rather than hyperpolarisation under control conditions.
A=Thank you, we agree the original sentence was somewhat inaccurate. However, a more complete
description would require an extensive paragraph, which previous versions of this manuscript used to
include but were taken out based on feedback from several previous reviewers who considered it
confusing. The phrase “the function of GABA-A receptors” was changed to “GABA-A receptors
functioning”, which is brief yet accurate. In addition, we added two more citations to the following
review papers in line 90:
-Nilsson GE, Lefevre S. 2016 Physiological challenges to fishes in a warmer and acidified future.
Physiology. 31, 409–17. (doi:10.1152/physiol.00055.2015).
-Tresguerres M, Hamilton TJ. in press Acid-base physiology, neurobiology and behaviour in relation to
CO2-induced ocean acidification. J Exp Biol.
l.92 – “elevated CO2-induced pH levels” could be misread to mean elevated pH levels. Suggest re-
wording to avoid potential confusion.
A=Thank you. It has been changed to “elevated CO2-induced acidification” in line 94.
l.100 – Numbers and units should always be separated by a space (i.e., 7 m and 17 m).
A=Spaces were added
l.102 – Should be “Time series data…. have also…” not “has”. Data are plural.
A=Fixed.
l.137 – Should be “within 15 m of surface” not “from surface”.
A=Fixed.
l.153 – Fish were acclimated for “at least 30 days”, but some may have been acclimate for much longer
(almost a year), depending on how the collected batches of fish were used. This issue needs further
description to more explicitly explain the use of collected fish and their provenance.
A=Thank you. This has been fixed as explained above in response to the same comment.
l.158 – How was the selection made “random”. If this is down to the user netting fish ad hoc, then it is
probably not really random, as this usually selects the boldest or slowest fish that are most easily
caught.
A=Great question! Allow me to describe how I mitigated this bias. The first set of experiments required
54 fish, and there were 60 available. The second set of experiments required 108 fish, and there were
140 available. To select fish for the experiment and for the treatments without bias, I used R to
randomly generate a list of numbers (from 1-60 in the first; from 1-140 in the second experiment), with
each number associated to two parameters: the first parameter determined whether fish netted in that
order was used in the experiment (54 in the first set of experiments, 108 in the second) or discarded (6
in the first set of experiments, 32 in the second), and the second parameter determined which replicate
tank the fish was placed into (up to 6 fish per replicate tank). This procedure made the order in which
the fish were netted became a random variable, and mitigated concerns regarding boldest / slowest fish
biases (Note: answer provided by an eager graduate student, who also had and executed this idea).
l.200 – Suggest changing to “…captured by a FireWire…”
A=Thank you, it was changed.
l.214 – How long was food withheld prior to test? This is relevant to determine whether this is long
enough for the gut to be empty, and how hungry the fish would be (which could influence behaviour).
A=Adjusted. Lines 220-221 now reads “Blacksmiths were not fed for 24 hours prior to behavioural
testing”. There are two main reasons why we tested fish that had not recently eaten. Firstly, some of us
are currently working on a manuscript in which we demonstrate that fish who have not been fed prior to
behavioural testing have superior memory abilities compared to those who were just fed. This was
performed using a novel object recognition test in zebrafish. Because cognitive abilities are related to
the shoaling and anxiety-like behaviours in the current study we did not want a fully belly to influence
these behaviours. Secondly, in our study on rockfish we also did not feed fish on the day of testing, so
we maintained this for consistency. We have added the reference to our rockfish paper “[14]” on line
221.
l.325 – Should be “blood acid-base regulation”, not “A-B regulation”.
A=L 348 has been changed to acid-base.
l.395-396 – I think it is interpreting too far to say that blacksmith will be a “winner” species regarding
future OA effects, based only on these anxiety-related behaviours. This needs to be toned down and
made specific to these behaviours only.
A=Again, we agree with the limitations of our study and we have included abundant caveats and
explanations throughout the manuscript. However, we believe these “negative” results should be treated
the same way as studies that suggest deleterious and catastrophic effects of OA based on similarly
flawed tests.
Please notice we are not concluding blacksmith will be “winners” and rockfish “losers”, but that we
conclude that we identified “potential winners and loser species” based on results from blacksmiths (this
study) and rockfish (Hamilton et al 2013) tested under identical conditions. However, to appease this
reviewer and other scientists with similar concerns, the following sentence was added “However, this
possibility should be experimentally confirmed by other behavioural and physiological tests, which would
ideally combine laboratory and field studies.”
Figure 2 and 3 legends or figures do not state what season these data are for.
A=Thank you. This has been fixed as explained above in response to the same comment.
