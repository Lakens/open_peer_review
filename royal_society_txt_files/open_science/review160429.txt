Manuscript RSOS-160429, "Packing and Deploying Soft Origami To and From Cylindrical
Volumes with Application to Automotive Airbags", investigates how different folding techniques
can be used to improve the performance characteristics of automobile airbags.
- Page 2, line 12: soft-sheet material is defined as 'material...with approximately zero stiffness (for
example textiles...'. Do the authors mean approximately zero bending stiffness (as there is still
some in-plane membrane stiffness in the listed soft materials)?
- Section 2 a-c: There is quite a lot of duplicate information between the 'pattern selection and
modelling' section and the 'packing method' sections for both patterns. (e.g. "this pattern is a
series of cones that have been inverted multiple times...'). The duplicate information could be
removed so this section is more compact.
- Section 3: Could the authors please provide further information about the airbag material (type,
thickness) and the cylindrical packing volume dimensions) used.
- Section 3d: Tests 'followed common deployment tests protocols' - was there a code or standard
used and if so, which one(s)?
- Page 11, Line 21: "vaible" should be changed to "viable"
- With the exception of the Nested Cylinder Mechanism, the mechanisms used to fold the
inverted cone cylinder seem to provide a final stored configuration that is quite different from the
initially proposed inverted-cone pattern. The initially proposed folded state is also conical, which
unfolds to the pac-man type sheet (Figure 3a), which is different from the unfolded circular
airbag state. The paper would be strengthened with additional discussion as to how closely the
different folding mechanisms for the inverted cone have preserved the initially-proposed pattern.
- Figure 12: deployment times in ms should be listed alongside Figure 12, similar to that shown in
Figure 8.
- Page 13, Line 54: "likely due to us..., leading us to..." - this phrase seems a little informal and
should be rewritten.
- Page 16, Line 14: "soft origami allows for a more quantitative approach wherein the same
pattern can be packed using many different methods". This statement should be revisited in view
on the above comment regarding how closely different folding mechanisms have preserved a
given pattern.
- The following reference seems relevant for inclusion: "Cromvik, Christoffer, and Kenneth
Eriksson. "Airbag folding based on origami mathematics." Origami4: Fourth International

ge 2, line 12: soft-sheet material is defined as 'material...with approximately zero stiffness (for example
iles...'. Do the authors mean approximately zero bending stiffness (as there is still some in-plane membrane
ness in the listed soft materials)?
The authors do mean approximately zero bending stiffness, and the manuscript has been modified as
suggested.
tion 2 a-c: There is quite a lot of duplicate information between the 'pattern selection and modelling' section
the 'packing method' sections for both patterns. (e.g. "this pattern is a series of cones that have been
erted multiple times...'). The duplicate information could be removed so this section is more compact.
Duplicate information was removed.
tion 3: Could the authors please provide further information about the airbag material (type, thickness) and
cylindrical packing volume dimensions) used.
The paragraph in Section 3 (a) now reads:
“The aforementioned packing methods were applied to automotive driver's side airbags consisting of two
circular soft-sheet-material disks sewn together around the outer edge and having an inflator inserted
through a central hole in the bottom layer of material. Nylon airbags, measuring approximately 0.25mm in
thickness per layer, were packed into a cylindrical mount with a diameter of 122mm and height of 57mm.”
ection 3d: Tests 'followed common deployment tests protocols' - was there a code or standard used and if
which one(s)?
Due to lack of ongoing collaboration with Autoliv, the codes, standards, deployment pressures, etc. used
in the tests are unavailable to the authors. As such this change was not made.
age 11, Line 21: "vaible" should be changed to "viable"
The spelling of this word has been corrected.
ith the exception of the Nested Cylinder Mechanism, the mechanisms used to fold the inverted cone
nder seem to provide a final stored configuration that is quite different from the initially proposed inverted-
e pattern. The initially proposed folded state is also conical, which unfolds to the pac-man type sheet
ure 3a), which is different from the unfolded circular airbag state. The paper would be strengthened with
itional discussion as to how closely the different folding mechanisms for the inverted cone have preserved
initially-proposed pattern.
Several changes have been made to address this comment.
Section 3(c ) paragraph 3 sentences 4 and 5 formerly read,
“For this prototype, the left over flaps on the right hand side were wrapped clockwise, while the flaps on
the left were wrapped counter clockwise. The packing efficiency was similar to that of the baseline, but is
expected to be improved with a well-developed folding apparatus.”
And they were modified to now read (changes highlighted),
“For this prototype, the left over flaps on the right hand side were wrapped clockwise, while the flaps on
the left were wrapped counter clockwise. Note that this method is only a discretised version of the inverted
cone fold, and with more paddles it would yield a final packed state that more closely resembles the
inverted cone fold, and additionally would have a smaller flap size. The packing efficiency was similar to
that of the baseline, but is expected to be improved with a well-developed folding apparatus.
Section 3(c ) paragraph 4 sentences 6-7 formerly read,
“Successive cylinders are introduced in a like manner, from alternating directions, until the airbag is
completely enclosed. The cinching belt is then placed around the outermost cylinder, and is tightened as
each cylinder from large to small is removed. Figure 11(b) further depicts how the folds are created as
cylinders are added.
And have been modified to read (changes highlighted),
“Successive cylinders are introduced in a like manner, from alternating directions, until the airbag is
completely enclosed. The cinching belt is then placed around the outermost cylinder, and is tightened as
each cylinder from large to small is removed. Figure 11(b) further depicts how the folds are created as
cylinders are added, and this method results in the highest-fidelity approximation of the original inverted-
cone fold curved-crease pattern when compared with the other methods.”
Finally, in the Discussion and Conclusion Section (Section 4), paragraph 4 formerly read,
“Another accomplishment of this research was the modification of packing method based on deployment
performance. Although the same pattern (the inverted-cone fold) was used, different packing methods
were shown to influence deployment performance, which is likely true of many Soft Origami patterns and
applications. That is, unlike traditional origami, where fold lines constrain behaviour, Soft Origami allows
for a more quantitative approach wherein the same pattern can be packed using many different methods
depending on the application constraints.”
And was modified to read (changes highlighted),
“Another accomplishment of this research was the modification of packing method based on deployment
performance. Although the same pattern (the inverted-cone fold) was used, different packing methods
were shown to influence deployment performance, which is likely true of many Soft Origami patterns and
applications. That is, unlike traditional origami, where fold lines constrain behaviour, Soft Origami allows
for a more quantitative approach wherein the same pattern can be packed using many different methods
depending on the application constraints. However, different packing methods and levels of discretisation
result in packed patterns that match the original desired pattern with varying degrees of fidelity.”
gure 12: deployment times in ms should be listed alongside Figure 12, similar to that shown in Figure 8.
Times were added on the figure, in the caption, and in the main text. The caption now reads (changes
highlighted),
“Images of three packing methods for the inverted-cone fold implemented in airbags in test stand
deployment tests. All deployments were done using compressed air and deploying at about one-fifteenth
of the speed of the prior deployment tests. Packing methods include the the slider mechanism (using 4
sliding mechanisms, the same method and pattern shown previously in Fig. 8 under the title "Inverted-
Cone") as a baseline as well as the Folding Cross Method and Nested Cylinder Method. Centrelines are
imposed to show orientation of central panel. Columns represent different packing methods, as labelled.
Rows represent three different times: 1 - 1.48s; 2 - 1.85s; 3 - 3.42s. Images were taken at times when
important deployment characteristics could be compared and are at approximately the same proportional
times throughout deployment as prior images. The Folding Cross Method and Nested Cylinder Method
appear to show less rotation upon deployment.”
age 13, Line 54: "likely due to us..., leading us to..." - this phrase seems a little informal and should be
ritten.
The sentence which formerly read,
“To determine whether the inverted-cone fold performed similarly in both tests (and thus if the tests will
likely show similar performance), an airbag folded using the same method and pattern was deployed and
included in Fig. 12, labelled ``Slider Mechanism," and it was seen in both cases that the angular rotation
of the central panel between Time 1 and Time 3 was similar (albeit in the opposite direction, likely due to
us wrapping the leftover flaps in the opposite direction), leading us to be confident that the compressed-air
tests should show similar deployment characteristics.”
now reads (changed portions are highlighted in both sentences):
“To determine whether the inverted-cone fold performed similarly in both tests (and thus if the tests will
likely show similar performance), an airbag folded using the same method and pattern was deployed and
is included in Fig. 12 labelled "Slider Mechanism". It was seen in both cases that the angular rotation of
the central panel between Time 1 and Time 3 was similar (albeit in the opposite direction, likely due to the
leftover flaps being wrapped in the opposite direction), indicating that the compressed-air tests should
show similar deployment characteristics.”
age 16, Line 14: "soft origami allows for a more quantitative approach wherein the same pattern can be
ked using many different methods". This statement should be revisited in view on the above comment
arding how closely different folding mechanisms have preserved a given pattern.
A portion has been added discussing how close the final pattern is to the original one. The sentence which
formerly read
“That is, unlike traditional origami, where fold lines constrain behaviour, Soft Origami allows for a more
quantitative approach wherein the same pattern can be packed using many different methods depending
on the application constraints.”
now reads (addition highlighted):
“That is, unlike traditional origami, where fold lines constrain behaviour, Soft Origami allows for a more
quantitative approach wherein the same pattern can be packed using many different methods (with
varying fidelity to the original pattern) depending on the application constraints.
