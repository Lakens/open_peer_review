This paper investigated rigidly foldable tessellations by using a method for analysing the rigid
foldability of origami patterns. The work presented in this paper is of interests and the origami
tessellation is a new trend in the artistic discipline which enables innovative engineering
solutions in recent years.
There are some remarks listed below.
1. As the authors stated in section 2, the method used in this manuscript was proposed in
their previous work [20] referenced here. Some of the key bases of the used method are not very
clear though a brief review has been given. Further, the reference [20] is not available at this
moment. For instance, what is the advantage of the proposed method in comparison to the
quaternions based method in reference [17]? What the exact meaning of ‘parity’, referring to those
four bullet points on page 3? Are there any other necessary conditions besides that given in Eq.
(2.1)? The authors are encouraged to have a further check of the possible relationships between
sector angles in a degree-four vertex. Can the author explain more about the derivations of Eqs.
(2.3 – 2.6)?
2. Do gadgets added in the modified foldable patterns increase the complexity in the
design and modelling of tessellations?
3. It seems there may be some related work focusing on standard origami crease bases
composed origami tessellations. It would be good to see how this work compares to that of some
of the work below for example.

The authors present a test to determine if a given flat-foldable origami patterns is rigidly foldable.
They illustrate how this works with several well-known existing patterns. Finally, they use their
test to show how one can modify an existing pattern by adding "gadgets" (new fold motifs) that
maintain the rigid foldability of the original pattern.
I find this paper very interesting and well written. The authors arguments are clear and concise
and will greatly benefit the growing origami math/physics community. Although I have a couple
of comments/questions, I think the paper is very good as is and I therefore recommend for
publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Questions/Comments:
1) The authors mention that the result of their previous work for determining the rigid
foldability of 4-vertex patterns applies only to flat-foldable patterns. As far as I can tell, this also
applies to the current manuscript. Is this the case? Or does the criterion also apply to non-flat
foldable patterns? If the criterion only works for flat-foldable patterns, I suggest that further
emphasizing this (at least in the abstract) would make the results a little clearer to the reader.
2) This may be beyond the scope of this paper, but based on my own work I'd like to make the
following suggestion for the authors to consider. We recently showed that certain tessellations
can be rigidly folded in more than one way (these are non-flat foldable generalizations of
Barreto's "Mars"--see Waitukaitis et al., PRE 2015). This has to do with the fact that any 4-vertex
can be folded in at least two ways. Are the patterns that the authors looked at capable of rigidly
folding in more than one way? Is there any way to see this easily from their results or an
extension thereof? Perhaps this is an interesting direction for future work.

By and large I appreciated the scope of this paper. Origami has become a rapidly growing field
of scientific research, and a paper that organizes and relates many of the essential concepts that
underpin rigidly foldable structures certainly has immense value. In some places, this paper
comes through on this promise admirably. For instance, the detailed example of how fold
multipliers work and can be used to determine flat foldability for the Huffman grid in figure 5
was particularly nice. As is the mostly complete analysis of of the “triple parallel gadget.”
However, overwhelmingly, the examples of rigidly foldable structures presented are not proved
to be rigidly foldable using the formalism presented in the paper. For example, there doesn’t
appear to be any demonstration of flat foldability for the patterns in section 3(b), 3(c),3(d),3(e),
3(f), and 3(g). While I can appreciate the fact that the paper would become exceedingly long if
every example were worked out, I think it would benefit the reader if, at least, specific citations
indicating how rigid foldability is demonstrated can be appended to the raw statements currently
in the text. Moreover, sections 3(g), 4(a) are completely unreferenced, leaving the reader to
determine for themselves or search on their own and claims like “this configuration is stiffer than
the original Miura-ori” (pg 13, line 54) proliferate in the section on new structures, but must be
supplemented with some kind of proof.
Finally, I have some questions regarding the overall hierarchy of flat foldable patterns presented
in this work. Specifically figure 2 seems, at first glance, to be a sort of family tree linking together
different fold patterns by certain operations. However, after closer inspection, I found that very
few of the arrows that make up the tree diagram are actually repeated. That said, I get the
distinct impression that, because the relationships applied to link these patterns are essentially
unrestricted, I could construct any number of different tree diagrams implicating different sets of
relationships.
Ultimately, I would like to pose the challenge to the authors to construct a more restrained
version of figure 2. That is, can the authors restrict themselves to a well defined, minimal set of
operations (like those that underpin crystal symmetry groups) and construct a similar tree
diagram. If not, I am suspicious about the actual content in the relationships presented here.
Otherwise, I think that if the authors can make good on refining figure 2 and expanding the
content to include a significant amount of references or worked examples, I will certainly
recommend this paper for publication.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
The critiques for Rigidly Foldable Origami Gadgets and Tessellations were partially addressed.
The authors now include a scheme that should in principle indicate whether a pattern is rigidly
7
foldable. This is a major modification to the manuscript and I appreciate the effort the authors
made to include this scheme in the new manuscript. I have now described this scheme to several
of my colleagues and, perhaps because of my poor explanations I am still finding it difficult to
convince folks of rigid foldability. Often very basic questions come up. First, there are some
breaks with convention since blue and red have often been used to represent mountain and
valley folds whereas here, mountain and valley folds are indicated by solid and dashed lines.
Assumptions about the various angles adding up to 360 degrees are implied but not clearly
stated. I know these details seem trivial to the experts, but this is intended to be a paper for the
more general scientist and without these assumptions clearly stated and without walking
through at least one example pattern, it would be difficult to decode or decide “by inspection”
whether a pattern was rigidly foldable.
The second major critique presented was that figure 2 is not very useful for someone looking to
design a new pattern. I think this is still a weakness of the figure. My critique should not hold up
publication of this manuscript. However, I would still like to encourage the authors to at least
explain how to use this figure or how it can be of use when trying to make a particular pattern.
As it stands, I am finding it difficult to see how this figure can be used as a roadmap that helps
create new patterns. Once again, walking through a particular example would be helpful to this
reader.
As an aside, I also don’t buy the hypercube description since a hypercube should have an equal
number of struts coming in and out of each vertex. Thankfully the authors do not use that
language in the manuscript but they should be a bit more careful even in their responses to
referees.
Minor comment:
In reference #1, Institute and Astronautical are misspelled.

The reference to [20] has been updated and more information about the derivations of

added, as requested. A discussion of the meaning of parity is now included in the revised
manuscript.
Do gadgets added in the modified foldable patterns increase the complexity in the design and
delling of tessellations?
The manuscript has been modified to confirm that adding gadgets can increase complexity in
the design because more creases are added to the system.
t seems there may be some related work focusing on standard origami crease bases composed
ami tessellations. It would be good to see how this work compares to that of some of the work

he authors mention that the result of their previous work for determining the rigid foldability of 4-
ex patterns applies only to flat-foldable patterns. As far as I can tell, this also applies to the current
nuscript. Is this the case? Or does the criterion also apply to non-flat foldable patterns? If the
erion only works for flat-foldable patterns, I suggest that further emphasizing this (at least in the
tract) would make the results a little clearer to the reader.
This method only applies to flat-foldable patterns. This emphasis has been added to the
abstract and the body of the paper, as suggested.
his may be beyond the scope of this paper, but based on my own work I'd like to make the following
gestion for the authors to consider. We recently showed that certain tessellations can be rigidly
ed in more than one way (these are non-flat foldable generalizations of Barreto's "Mars"--see
tukaitis et al., PRE 2015). This has to do with the fact that any 4-vertex can be folded in at least two
s. Are the patterns that the authors looked at capable of rigidly folding in more than one way? Is
re any way to see this easily from their results or an extension thereof? Perhaps this is an interesting
ction for future work.
This reference and a brief corresponding discussion have been added to the revised
manuscript. Some of the questions raised here are very interesting considerations for possible
future work.

and large I appreciated the scope of this paper. Origami has become a rapidly growing field of
ntific research, and a paper that organizes and relates many of the essential concepts that underpin
dly foldable structures certainly has immense value. In some places, this paper comes through on this
mise admirably. For instance, the detailed example of how fold multipliers work and can be used to
ermine flat foldability for the Huffman grid in figure 5 was particularly nice. As is the mostly complete
lysis of of the “triple parallel gadget.”
Thank you.
wever, overwhelmingly, the examples of rigidly foldable structures presented are not proved to be
dly foldable using the formalism presented in the paper. For example, there doesn’t appear to be any
onstration of flat foldability for the patterns in section 3(b), 3(c),3(d),3(e), 3(f), and 3(g). While I can
reciate the fact that the paper would become exceedingly long if every example were worked out, I
k it would benefit the reader if, at least, specific citations indicating how rigid foldability is
onstrated can be appended to the raw statements currently in the text. Moreover, sections 3(g),
are completely unreferenced, leaving the reader to determine for themselves or search on their
n and claims like “this configuration is stiffer than the original Miura-ori” (pg 13, line 54) proliferate in
section on new structures, but must be supplemented with some kind of proof.
Because of space constraints, the authors’ original intent was to provide a detailed example of
applying the method to a tessellation (the Huffman Grid) and then showing the results for
other tessellations without the detailed calculations. However, in response to the reviewer’s
comment, we are pleased to report that there is a method for demonstrating rigid foldability
by modifying the diagrams to demonstrate distinct fold angles for all tessellations shown in the
paper. This resulted in the modification of all the crease patterns in the paper to add
information indicating distinct fold angles on the fold lines. For each type of vertex, the fold
angle multipliers ensure that certain pairs of fold angles are the same in the vertex, and we
indicate same-ness by adding color to each fold line, choosing different colors for each distinct
fold angle. Then the proof that a given pattern is rigidly foldable boils down to simple
inspection: we note that the fold lines emanating from each vertex match in both fold
direction and fold angle (magnitude) with the fold lines of each surrounding vertex. This not
only demonstrates the rigid foldability, but this is an example of the power of the fold angle
multiplier method. One can both construct and prove rigid foldability by purely graphical
techniques and simple inspection, possibly augmented by a little bit of scalar algebra.
lly, I have some questions regarding the overall hierarchy of flat foldable patterns presented in this
k. Specifically figure 2 seems, at first glance, to be a sort of family tree linking together different fold
terns by certain operations. However, after closer inspection, I found that very few of the arrows that
ke up the tree diagram are actually repeated. That said, I get the distinct impression that, because
relationships applied to link these patterns are essentially unrestricted, I could construct any
ber of different tree diagrams implicating different sets of relationships.
As pointed out by the reviewer, the original manuscript contained only a very brief description
of the purpose of Figure 2 and the relationships shown there. More explanation concerning
the restraints used to define the connections for Figure 2 have been added to the manuscript
to provide increased understanding of the purpose and the constraints of the diagram.
As noted by the reviewer, it is possible to construct a number of diagrams implicating different
types of relationships. The revised manuscript now discusses the reasons for this, and more
details are provided here. Our taxonomy is a hypercube rather than a tree (although in two-
dimensions it appears that way), and a strict tree-like taxonomy is probably not possible
because there are multidimensional axes of variation. So in the diagram, the arrows represent
relationships along multiple axes. So, the presence of loops in the graph is not an error in the
selectivity of the taxonomy; it's an indication that there are multiple dimensions along which
one could characterize a pattern. Crucially, with multidimensional relationships, any collapse
of the actual space into a 2D network is going to be somewhat arbitrary. Our goal in this
diagram was not to present "the proper way" of organizing such patterns, but rather to draw
together both known and new rigidly foldable patterns and illustrate some of the relationships
among them.
mately, I would like to pose the challenge to the authors to construct a more restrained version of
re 2. That is, can the authors restrict themselves to a well defined, minimal set of operations (like
se that underpin crystal symmetry groups) and construct a similar tree diagram. If not, I am
picious about the actual content in the relationships presented here. Otherwise, I think that if the
hors can make good on refining figure 2 and expanding the content to include a significant amount of
rences or worked examples, I will certainly recommend this paper for publication.
Additional constraints have been added to the description of Figure 2 and more detail has
been added to the examples, as suggested by the reviewer and as described above.

e often been used to represent mountain and valley folds whereas here, mountain and valley folds
indicated by solid and dashed lines. Assumptions about the various angles adding up to 360 degrees
implied but not clearly stated. I know these details seem trivial to the experts, but this is intended to
a paper for the more general scientist and without these assumptions clearly stated and without
king through at least one example pattern, it would be difficult to decode or decide “by inspection”
ether a pattern was rigidly foldable.
Thank you for taking the time for a careful review and even discussing it with colleagues. We
have made the following changes to the manuscript in response to these suggestions and in
the spirit of making the paper as accessible as possible to the general scientist: (i) While the
text of the previous version mentioned the nomenclature for sold-dashed and color lines 1, this
version adds a description in nearly every figure caption, where it is more readily accessible to
the reader. (ii) The fact that the sector angles around a vertex sum to 2p is now explicitly
stated.
second major critique presented was that figure 2 is not very useful for someone looking to design a
pattern. I think this is still a weakness of the figure. My critique should not hold up publication of
manuscript. However, I would still like to encourage the authors to at least explain how to use this
re or how it can be of use when trying to make a particular pattern. As it stands, I am finding it
cult to see how this figure can be used as a roadmap that helps create new patterns. Once again,
king through a particular example would be helpful to this reader.
This comment has been helpful in better understanding the reviewer’s concern with the figure
and how to better address it. The previous revision provided additional explanation of Figure
2, including its intent and limitations. However, rather than intended as a design tool, it was
intended to show existing and new rigidly foldable patterns and some of the relationships
between them (we feel that is useful since each of these are described in more detail later in
the paper). The reviewer comment helped us to address the issue in two ways: first, on careful
review of the revised text, we could see how it could be interpreted to be intended as a design
guide. This revision clarifies that intent both in the body and in the figure caption. Second,
a note, here was some of our considerations in choosing the nomenclature selected: (1) There is no general convention for
=mountain red=valley (Oripa, for example, uses the opposite); (2) For color-blind people, color alone makes it difficult to
nguish mountain and valley; (3) When readers print a hardcopy in black and white, it is easier to distinguish solid and dash
us color; (4) Origami Design Secrets 2nd edition (2011) established the solid=mountain, dashed=valley convention. The
ed=valley convention has been in place since Honda's _Origami Shuko_, published in 1944, and has been followed by many
mi authors since. For crease patterns, replacing chain lines with solid lines provides clearer distinction for mountain folds.
although it was not the original intent to be used as a design tool, evaluating how to respond
to the comment revealed ways the figure could provide insight for the design of new
tessellations. Additional text in that regard has been added to the manuscript.
n aside, I also don’t buy the hypercube description since a hypercube should have an equal number
truts coming in and out of each vertex. Thankfully the authors do not use that language in the
nuscript but they should be a bit more careful even in their responses to referees.
We checked the manuscript to confirm the reviewer’s comment that this wording was not in
the manuscript.
or comment:
eference #1, Institute and Astronautical are misspelled.
Thanks for catching that! That was fixed and it led to a careful review of all the references to
ensure that no other such problems had crept in. In doing so we noted that a related paper
has been recently published (Y. Chen et al., Science, 2015) and that citation has been added.
