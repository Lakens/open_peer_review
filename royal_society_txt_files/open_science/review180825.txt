I thank the authors for addressing my comments on earlier drafts. I appreciate that my
comments are likely to have been frustrating to them. I have only trivial suggestions, all relating
to the central point of my earlier remarks, namely, the relationship between root orientation and
loading.
Line 23: replace "determine" with "estimate", or something similar.
Line 26: replace "demonstrate" with "suggest", and replace "was able" with "may have been able"
Line 203: replace "informs" with "may inform"
I don't entirely agree with the interpretation in the discussion, but I think that the authors should
be allowed to make their own interpretation. I look forward to seeing this published.

I find this approach of morphometric analysis of root shape very interesting. The reference of
dental thickness (if only marginally), dental microwear and enamel prism orientation and -
decussation as well as the TMJ result in a thorough approach to determine dietary niche
separation of hominins. More research should be done (not as part of this paper) concerning root
shape and dietary niche in (recent) primates with known dietary regimes that might give insight

into the "what" in connection with "how".

Decision letter (RSOS-180825.R0)
03-Aug-2018
Dear Dr Kupczik:
It is a pleasure to accept your manuscript entitled "On the relationship between maxillary molar
root shape and jaw kinematics in Australopithecus africanus and Paranthropus robustus" in its
current form for publication in Royal Society Open Science. The comments of the reviewer(s)
who reviewed your manuscript are included at the foot of this letter. The referees recommend a
small number of typographical changes that may be incorporated into your corrected proofs.
Thank you for your fine contribution. On behalf of the Editors of Royal Society Open Science, we
look forward to your continued contributions to the Journal.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science will introduce article processing charges for all new
submissions received from 1 January 2018. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to Royal
Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers submitted
as part of our collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry
(http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/chemistry).
If your manuscript is newly submitted and subsequently accepted for publication after 1 Jan 2018,
you will be asked to pay the article processing charge, unless you request a waiver and this is
approved by Royal Society Publishing. Manuscripts originally submitted prior to 1 Jan 2018 will
not subject to a charge, even if they are accepted in 2018. You can find out more about the charges
at http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/page/charges. Should you have any queries, please

Dear Author,
The reviews are very clearly supportive of the work you have done and although not entirely in
agreement with your conclusions are happy to have the discussion in the literature as a valid
opinion. There are three or four minor text changes requested by the reviewers that need to be
addressed but otherwise this paper is able to be accepted as is.
Sincerely,

Dear Prof. Kupczik,
Thank you for submitting your manuscript 'On the relationship between maxillary molar root
shape and jaw kinematics in Australopithecus africanus and Paranthropus robustus'. This is a
very interesting description of molar root shape and how it infers function and dietary habits in
hominids.
Although the manuscript appears to be suited for a more specific journal that RSOS, I have sent it
out to review.
I hope that we can return a final decision to you quickly on this matter.
