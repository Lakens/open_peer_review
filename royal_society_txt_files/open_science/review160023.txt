The main goal of the paper is to develop a methodology to: (1) model flooding due to heavy
rains, (2) measure the impact of flooding on road (highway) systems, (3) measure the efficacy of
various strategies to lessen the impact of flooding on road transport. Modeling the impact of
flooding is an incredibly difficult task, filled with uncertainties, and I really like the approach
taken by the authors. In fact, I can see that the authors are being “cautious” in every step of the
way, providing some evidence for their decision, which makes me think that they have received
unfavorable reviews in the past. Naturally, many assumptions are taken, and really only one
metric is measured (betweenness), but considering the current state-of-the-art in the field, I
believe the method used is sufficient, and the paper brings a contribution that should be
published in RSOS.
That being said, I do have a few comments, mostly on clarification. As mentioned, I am in the
same field, and I know how difficult it is to convey the method, and I will therefore make a series
of suggestions.
- The title is too vague as it stands. I would recommend being more specific, either by bringing
the word “betweenness” or “strategy” (i.e., modeling the impacts of various strategies…).
- the introduction has only one sub-section, 2.1 background. It should really be split in two
different section: 2. Introduction and 3. Background. I would also make the contribution of the
paper clearer. At the moment, the last paragraph of the introduction has a sentence “this paper
describes…” and the last paragraph of the background section has a sentence “this paper aims…”
Get one clear goal / objective / contribution in the introduction, and only cite the relevant
literature in the background.
- from figures 6, 9, and 10, it seems you are only considering highways. Is this correct? If so, make
it clear in the method section. Moreover, are you files “clean”? I have reviewed a paper recently
about a tool that cleans GIS files to network format (see whether it is relevant or not:
http://csun.uic.edu/data.html#GISF2E). In fact, the same group seems to have done some work
on flooding and betweenness centrality
(http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=7004428&tag=1).
- the method to use weighted betweenness centrality is clever. It’d be ideal to add real flows on
the highways, but I understand the data is not necessarily straightforward to acquire (or if you
use it, please make it clear). Plus, NetworkX is a great library to use.
- On page 6, in the first paragraph, about CityCAT, I understand it takes an elevation map. What
about catchment basins, sewer conduit size, etc.? If other researchers were to reproduce the
method to their own contexts, it would be valuable to add this information. I see the paper is
getting long, however, and you may want to move some information to an appendix or a
supplementary information file. I will leave this up to you.
- 3.1 model assumptions. I really like the statement on focusing at the macro-level. Clearly there is
too much uncertainty to focus at the micro-scale. Well done.
3
- Page 8, in the network modeling section, is it “Ordnance” or “Ordinance”?
- Page 9, the 30cm water limit used seems pretty high, although you are backing it with literature.
The same value is described as “severe” from Table 1. The information presented in Table 1 and
Figure 7 is actually a little redundant. Do you need both?
- 4.1.4 Adaptation, are scenarios A and B directly integrated in CityCAT or did you have to get
the values yourself from IDF curves? Again, this is purely to be able to reproduce the results.
- Grey adaptation. I must admit I have no idea that the grey adaptation strategies were. Are
conduits getting larger, are catchment basins able to catch more rain? What does “hardening”
mean? Since you seem to suggest grey adaptation is more effective than green adaptation, could
you clarify?
- Again on grey adaptation, the 90% lowest value, etc. based on betweenness. Is that after
flooding, before flooding? It was not clear.
- in your results, I found some of the answers quite weird. Betweenness centrality is a sum. If
some links are being affected (i.e., removed), the network will become smaller, and betweenness
centrality will decrease for all links (unless it is normalized or very few links are removed). From
table 3, the fact the average and maximum betweenness centrality values increase for all scenarios
compared to business-as-usual is really odd. Are you really removing links from the network?
This is puzzling for me. Are you using the betweenness centrality measure correctly in
NetworkX?
- Figure 3 really adds nothing, but feel free to keep it if you feel it add relevant information, and if
so, perhaps add some labels.
That’s it for my comments. There are quite a few, but again, it’s mostly in the form (not so much
the content) and to explain the method. I look forward to reviewing a second version of the
paper.

The paper “Modeling Extreme Rainfall Impacts on Urban Transport” describes a method that can
be used to quantify the effects of flooding on an urban transportation system by including
topological network measures in a flooding impact assessment. The paper also models the effect
of potential mitigation efforts on flood impacts. The application of network tools to traditional
engineering domains like flood impact assessment and flood hazard is a useful contribution for
estimating the socio-economic and infrastructure consequences of adverse weather events, and
could be applied to most kinds of adverse events that urban infrastructure systems face.
I have three important comments and a couple of minor notes:
First, The paper’s measure of betweenness centrality uses edge weights to account for travel time
between two nodes. It does not explicitly include measures of the importance of any node or
edge in actual traffic patterns. The authors do use traffic patterns to estimate most likely routes
in disturbed and undisturbed simulations which influences BC for a given node, but this is
different from including the differing weights of traffic through nodes in the BC measure directly.
The edge-weight for BC is a measure of how easy/hard it is to do a given trip but not how many
people actually do the trip. By using this version of BC the authors assume there are people
everywhere going everywhere. The authors could relax that assumption to a more realistic one by
putting a weight on the increase in centrality that depends on how many people actually do that
trip.
Second, The papers assumption of 100% coverage for green roofs is not realistic, and may bias the
results. Many buildings are not capable of supporting the additional weight of a green roof.
These buildings are likely to be older and therefore concentrated in the center of the city where
the authors note impervious surfaces are also highest. Thus, this assumption could
systematically over-estimate of the benefits of green roofs in areas where they are most likely to
be beneficial.
Finally, I disagree with the authors justification for not modeling the effects of green roofs for the
100 year return period. The authors state “… their effectiveness for high intensity rainfall events
may be limited, especially during long wet spells .. (pg 11, line 18)" seems like an important
reason to compare the effect of green roofs on transportation infrastructure for high vs medium
intensity rainfall events rather than not measuring effects. If green roofs are only effective in
reducing transportation impacts from flooding in certain contexts, this is an important (if
unexpected) finding and should be first measured and then acknowledged directly.
Other notes:
Table 3 and the maps in Figs 9,10 & 12 would be easier to interpret if they were presented as
differences or percent differences between the treatment and control conditions.
Some of the writing is unclear, e.g. lines 45-50 on page 11.
The conclusions would be more clear if there was an effort to integrate findings on changes in BC
and traffic delays, including comments on why both measures of disruption are informative.

Dear Editors and Reviewers,
On behalf of my co-authors I am delighted to enclose the revised version of the manuscript RSOS-160023
entitled “Assessing Urban Strategies for Reducing the Impacts of extreme weather on Infrastructure
Networks” (formerly “Modelling Extreme Rainfall Impacts on Urban Transport”).
We are very grateful for some excellent and thoughtful feedback from both editors and reviewers. We set
out below how we have addressed all the comments and have amended the manuscript accordingly. We
feel the paper has been improved as a result, and we hope you agree that it is now ready for publication.
Please do not hesitate to contact me, however, if you have any further questions.
Yours faithfully,
Reviewer #1
- The title is too vague as it stands. I would recommend being more specific, either by bringing the word
“betweenness” or “strategy” (i.e., modeling the impacts of various strategies…).
The title has been modified to “Assessing Urban Strategies for Reducing Impacts on Infrastructure
Networks”.
- The introduction has only one sub-section, 2.1 background. It should really be split in two different
section: 2. Introduction and 3. Background. I would also make the contribution of the paper clearer. At the
moment, the last paragraph of the introduction has a sentence “this paper describes…” and the last
paragraph of the background section has a sentence “this paper aims…” Get one clear goal / objective /
contribution in the introduction, and only cite the relevant literature in the background.
The introduction has been modified and now has two sections: 2. Introduction (includes the aim and
contributions), and 3. Background. However, on reviewing the rest of the paper we felt the same comment
was relevant to other sections so have included a few more sub-section headings to help readers.
- From figures 6, 9, and 10, it seems you are only considering highways. Is this correct? If so, make it
clear in the method section. Moreover, are you files “clean”? I have reviewed a paper recently about a
tool that cleans GIS files to network format (see whether it is relevant or not:
http://csun.uic.edu/data.html#GISF2E). In fact, the same group seems to have done some work on flooding
and betweenness centrality
(http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=7004428&tag=1).
The approach presented in the paper is intended to be generic and transferable, but the application
described here is focussed on a road network. Hence, the method is applicable to any infrastructure
network along which there are flows. The ITN data used is a dataset specifically for the generation of
topologically valid networks, and thus is already “clean”. This has been explained in the revised text.
Thank you for the pointer to the GIS tool; it looks like it may be very useful indeed for other future work.
- On page 6, in the first paragraph, about CityCAT, I understand it takes an elevation map. What about
catchment basins, sewer conduit size, etc.? If other researchers were to reproduce the method to their own
contexts, it would be valuable to add this information. I see the paper is getting long, however, and you
may want to move some information to an appendix or a supplementary information file. I will leave this
up to you.
CityCAT uses elevation maps and built environment features (e.g. building footprint and green areas) from
topographical data (in this case Ordnance Survey Mastermap data, available in the UK on
http://digimap.edina.ac.uk/ ). Catchment basins for overland flow are included in the model simulations.
Recently developments have also allowed the inclusion sewer conduits, however this was not implemented
for this study.
- Page 8, in the network modeling section, is it “Ordnance” or “Ordinance”?
It is “Ordnance”.
- Page 9, the 30cm water limit used seems pretty high, although you are backing it with literature. The
same value is described as “severe” from Table 1. The information presented in Table 1 and Figure 7 is
actually a little redundant. Do you need both?
Table 1 is a method to identify key links in the network which are vulnerable to flooding (and therefore
suitable for possible future adaptation), whereas Figure 7 the ‘damage function’ used to calculate new
speeds on the road network relating to depth. As they show different things, both seem to the authors to be
needed.
- 4.1.4 Adaptation, are scenarios A and B directly integrated in CityCAT or did you have to get the values
yourself from IDF curves? Again, this is purely to be able to reproduce the results.
Scenarios A and B are directly obtained from CityCAT, by adding the capacity to store 5 cm of water to
buildings in the study area. This has been specified in the revised text. We have also incorporated a clearer
scenario labelling approach.
- Grey adaptation. I must admit I have no idea that the grey adaptation strategies were. Are conduits
getting larger, are catchment basins able to catch more rain? What does “hardening” mean? Since you
seem to suggest grey adaptation is more effective than green adaptation, could you clarify?
Clarifications have been added in the text and the term is no longer used to avoid confusion. Interventions
of grey adaptation include all those measures that are “structural” and invasive, i.e. physical alterations to
the infrastructure components in question. In the specific case of “node hardening”, such interventions
could be done in real terms by raising the level of the roads, or by enhancing the drainage systems or by
designing storage tanks for stormwater harvesting.
- Again on grey adaptation, the 90% lowest value, etc. based on betweenness. Is that after flooding, before
flooding? It was not clear.
This classification of road segments is based on the betweenness centrality values for the un-perturbed
networks. This has again been clarified in the text.
- in your results, I found some of the answers quite weird. Betweenness centrality is a sum. If some links
are being affected (i.e., removed), the network will become smaller, and betweenness centrality will
decrease for all links (unless it is normalized or very few links are removed). From table 3, the fact the
average and maximum betweenness centrality values increase for all scenarios compared to business-as-
usual is really odd. Are you really removing links from the network? This is puzzling for me. Are you using
the betweenness centrality measure correctly in NetworkX?
The analysis uses a normalised betweenness centrality, which was briefly mentioned, but has been made
clearer in equation 1. Further to this, by weighting the betweenness centrality on the time to traverse each
edge, the shortest paths used in this calculation find the quickest route through the network. During the
simulated events, the time to travel along an edge is calculated using the speed of possible travel based on
the flood depth, so where flooding is extreme, the time to travel the edge becomes so large that shortest
paths no longer use the effected edges. Therefore in answer to your question, we do not remove any edges;
the cost to traverse them increases and thus shortest paths increase, and betweenness centrality increases.
This has also been clarified in the text.
- Figure 3 really adds nothing, but feel free to keep it if you feel it add relevant information, and if so,
perhaps add some labels.
In uploading the paper, the incorrect map for Figure 3 was uploaded; the correct Figure 3 has labels, to
indicate road locations and names. The correct one will be uploaded.

Comments to the Author(s)
1) The paper’s measure of betweenness centrality uses edge weights to account for travel time between two
nodes. It does not explicitly include measures of the importance of any node or edge in actual traffic
patterns. The authors do use traffic patterns to estimate most likely routes in disturbed and undisturbed
simulations which influences BC for a given node, but this is different from including the differing weights
of traffic through nodes in the BC measure directly. The edge-weight for BC is a measure of how
easy/hard it is to do a given trip but not how many people actually do the trip. By using this version of BC
the authors assume there are people everywhere going everywhere. The authors could relax that
assumption to a more realistic one by putting a weight on the increase in centrality that depends on how
many people actually do that trip.
Whilst the measure of BC used in the paper does not explicitly include traffic patterns to estimate likely
routes, other weights are used in an attempt to capture the most likely route taken. The weight/cost of each
edge takes into account free-flow speed from national transport modelling approaches, assigning lower
weights to more major roads. Data/observations on how many people are using links in the network (e.g.
actual traffic flows) are difficult to obtain for the entire network. Such observations for disrupted
situations have been used during the development of the model (shown in Figure 3) but are not available
for all links in the network. We have provided some further discussion on this issue, and acknowledge the
associated uncertainty this entails.
2) The papers assumption of 100% coverage for green roofs is not realistic, and may bias the
results. Many buildings are not capable of supporting the additional weight of a green roof. These
buildings are likely to be older and therefore concentrated in the center of the city where the authors note
impervious surfaces are also highest. Thus, this assumption could systematically over-estimate of the
benefits of green roofs in areas where they are most likely to be beneficial.
The “100% green roof scenario” has been used as sensitivity test in order to compare the effectiveness of
an extreme ‘green’ intervention across an entire urban area with a single intervention at a specific network
location (i.e., hardening of critical links). Whilst we acknowledge the installation of green roofs on 100%
of buildings is unrealistic, it shows the upper bounds of effectiveness of this intervention and allows
comparison of the most optimistic scenario possible with other more traditional interventions. Authors are
aware of the very simplistic assumptions and hope that these have now been made clear in the text.
3) I disagree with the authors justification for not modeling the effects of green roofs for the 100 year
return period. The authors state “… their effectiveness for high intensity rainfall events may be limited,
especially during long wet spells .. (pg 11, line 18)" seems like an important reason to compare the effect
of green roofs on transportation infrastructure for high vs medium intensity rainfall events rather than not
measuring effects. If green roofs are only effective in reducing transportation impacts from flooding in
certain contexts, this is an important (if unexpected) finding and should be first measured and then
acknowledged directly.
The authors agree with the reviewer and apologise for this oversight. The simulation for the 1 in 200 yrs
event with green roof adaptation has now been included in the revised paper. Labels have also been
changed, in order to increase the readability.
Other notes:
Table 3 and the maps in Figs 9,10 & 12 would be easier to interpret if they were presented as differences
or percent differences between the treatment and control conditions.
Some of the writing is unclear, e.g. lines 45-50 on page 11.
The conclusions would be more clear if there was an effort to integrate findings on changes in BC and
traffic delays, including comments on why both measures of disruption are informative.
All suggestions have been addressed in the final version of the paper.
