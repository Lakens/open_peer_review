Comments:
The study concerns the effect of the maternal age, environmental conditions and physiological
conditions on the size and fat content of the offspring in tse tse flies. The results shown here are
not novel, as in principle, what the study says, is that the females in better shape (more fat)
survive and produce better offspring (more fat). The fact, that colder condition leads to increased
body size, there as hotter environment leads to reduced body size is rather established and
expected knowledge and should be discussed here. I do not have a problem with this, as it is
good to have more support for the already existing theories.
Comments:
The title is misleading, as it only states the name of Glossina pallidipes Austen, but in the
manuscript the data for Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood is also presented.
Aim of the study (here aims of the analysis) should be explained in the introduction not in the
Material and Methods.
Could the paternal investment have a role? I know, that this was not the aim of the study, but
could be relevant as well.
Line – 45 – What do authors mean by absolute maternal investment here, is the body size only
measure? Clarify
Lines 53 – 61. First it is said, that tse tse fly females only produce a single offspring, later, that
they produce several. I understand, that it is meant, that females produce a single larvae at a time,
but can produce many over the course of time. Please make this more clear.
Lines 79 – 83. Does the claim made about the difference in the sample size and later in the
statistics regarding two different Glossiana species indicate that the results are due to the
increased sample size, and could be considered as false positive?
Lines 85 – 90 should be brought in the beginning of the introduction or deleted, as the last
paragraph could explain the aims of the study. Why it is important to study tse tse fly, could
come before.
Lines 104 – 110. How long did you wait until female laid a larvae? Was this monitored somehow?
If some females laid a larvae immediately and some took longer, how did you control for the
female environment, as an factor for reproductive investment? As we could argue, that the ones
who laid immediately would be making their investment decision based on what they
experienced before capture (as larvae should be almost fully developed) and the ones who took
longer (larvae still underdeveloped and needs transfer of nutrients from mother) might be
affected by experimental conditions.
Lines 114 – 121. It is not clear how accurately the authors can estimate the age of the wild caught
individuals. And as this is supposed to be one of the central aspects of the study, I think it is
3
really important to get this right. The method concerning the estimation based on the ovarian
development is unconvincing in my opinion. By dissecting the individuals of the same age, the
great variation in ovarian size and development can be seen. In my experience, sometimes, up to
40% of sister individuals for example have poor ovaries, regardless mating status and age. Later
there is description about the ovulation number estimation, but is not clear how this is related to
age and experiment. I can not evaluate the method based on the wing fray scoring, as the article
referring to it is from artificial rearing study (according to the title) from 1946 and not available
online. However, I am wondering, how is the captive study a good estimate for measuring the
age in the wild?
Line 164 says Aims of analysis. Which analysis? Is this about the environmental factors? It
should be stated so. Also, I can not follow, how the females based on capture date are divided
into different environmental conditions? Please clarify.
Lines 226 -227 – what is first pupal dry weight and all later pupal weight? Did females produce
multiple larvae. Sorry, I do not get it…
Lines 331 – 333 – the sentence about the wing fray and fat levels linked to age seems wrong – “
“significant decrease with age in fat levels”
Lines 330 – 333 – so, do the results depend on which parameter was used as a reflection of age? If
so, more research is needed to find out, which one is a correct one, as it is not clear which one is a
correct one.
Lines 388 – 409 – the last paragraph tries to link the study to the climate change. Although
relevant, I would decrease the amount of text in the paragraph and make a simpler speculation
about the effects of the climate change on the tse tse populations in the location.

This is an interesting study investigating how maternal age, environmental factors, and
physiological factors influence reproductive investment in wild tsetse. The manuscript is
generally well written and well organised.
I have one major criticism: in the Introduction, you set out the aim of your study, which is to
investigate reproductive investment strategies in G. pallidipes, and in the Methods, you describe
how you collected and dissected these G. pallipides flies. However, in the Results (L261-262), you
say “Results are shown for the present G. pallidipes data and also for previously published data
for G. m. morsitans.” From then onwards, in the Results and Discussion, you shift the focus of
your study to a comparison between G. pallidipes and G. m. morsitans. In my opinion, this
creates a big disconnect between the different sections and will undoubtedly confuse readers.
Additional comments:
1) L59: I think this should be “a female” rather than “the female”
2) L74-76: As someone who is not familiar with this study system, I did not understand this part
when I first read it (you talk about the baits in the Methods further down, and it makes sense
then).
2) L79-81: Edit for clarity.
3) L170: This should be “she had just produced.”
4) L280: The first sentence of your Discussion should (generally) be a summary of your most
important finding(s), so I find this sentence weak.
5) L367-369: “This is because there must be an upper limit to the benefits of producing large
offspring and, beyond some (unspecified) size, further increases in pupal size will cause a
decrease in pupal fitness.” I agree with the first part of this sentence, but I do not understand the
second part. Why would a larger pupal size be disadvantageous to the pupa? More explanation is
needed here.
6) Tables 1 and 2: The CI column is hard to read because the dashes and minuses look the same.
Perhaps consider having the lower and upper CI bounds in different columns.
7) The figures are aesthetically pleasing overall, but the axes look somewhat crowded (especially
the x-axis and y-axis in Figure 3).

Associate Editor's comments:
The reviewers listed a number of points which require further attention. One issue that emerged
in both reviews concerns the combination of new data (for G. pallidens) with published data (for
G. morsitans). To avoid the risk of confusion, I encourage the authors to spell out the role of G.
morsitans with regard to the research question of the present manuscript early on in the text.

Dear Ms Power
Thank you for your email of 27-Nov-2017 together with the comments of two reviewers. We
extend our thanks to these reviewers for their very full and positive consideration of our
paper. Addressing their comments will clearly lead to a stronger final product.
We provide the following responses to those comments – and have made the changes
ndicated, here and in the edited manuscript.
For purposes of clarity, all comments are italicised: our responses are in normal text.
Comments to Author:
Associate Editor's comments:
The reviewers listed a number of points which require further attention. One issue that
emerged in both reviews concerns the combination of new data (for G. pallidens) with
published data (for G. morsitans). To avoid the risk of confusion, I encourage the authors to
spell out the role of G. morsitans with regard to the research question of the present
manuscript early on in the text.
We agree that the title, and presentation, need to reflect the fact we are both analysing new
data for G. pallidipes and comparing these results with previously published work on G. m.
morsitans. We have, accordingly, added the words “and G. m. morsitans Westwood” to the
itle. Similarly, we have made changes in the Summary to show that we are looking at the
esults for both species, adding – for example: “We investigated how maternal age,
environmental and physiological factors influence reproductive investment in wild tsetse,
Glossina pallidipes and G. m. morsitans”.
Note that in order to meet the RSOS requirement that we use a maximum of 150 characters
we needed to drop the naming authority for each species. We cannot see how else to handle
his if both species are to be mentioned explicitly. We do cite the naming authority at the first
nstance of mention in the Summary and again in the main text.
We have also added the words “comparing the results with those for G. m. morsitans
Westwood,” in the Introduction, so that the reader is made aware, at the start of the paper, that
he study considers the results for both species.
Note that, in response to a comment from Reviewer 1, we have also included an additional
small analysis to compare the effects of temperature during a mother's pregnancy on offspring
size between the two species. This comparison arises due to the contrast in effect sizes from
he results already in our analyses. The fact that we find the proportional reduction in
offspring size in response to temperature is so much higher in the larger G. pallidipes than G.
m. morsitans has implications for understanding their responses to climate change, and we
mention this finding at the relevant part of the discussion (line X).
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer 1.
Comments to the Author(s)
1) The study concerns the effect of the maternal age, environmental conditions and
physiological conditions on the size and fat content of the offspring in tse tse flies. The
results shown here are not novel, as in principle, what the study says, is that the females
in better shape (more fat) survive and produce better offspring (more fat). The fact, that
colder condition leads to increased body size, there as hotter environment leads to
reduced body size is rather established and expected knowledge and should be discussed
here. I do not have a problem with this, as it is good to have more support for the already
existing theories.
We accept that it is well established that females in better physiological condition tend to
produce better offspring – and also that colder/hotter temperatures tend to lead to
increased/decreased body size. We had already referred to the literature on maternal
condition linking to offspring size by referring to the recent comprehensive review by
Rollinson & Rowe (2016, Biol. Rev.). We now make more explicit reference to the studies
linking maternal and developmental temperature with offspring size, as follows:
(i) in the introduction: "... maternal physiological condition, and the environment
experienced by the female during pregnancy, correlate with offspring size according to
predictions based on theory [English et al. 2016], and as has been shown in a suite of
other invertebrate systems [reviewed in Rollinson & Rowe 2016; Mousseau & Dingle
1991; Atkinson 1994]"; and
(ii) in the discussion: "We show here that pupal weights decrease significantly with
the temperature a mother experiences during pregnancy. The link between
developmental temperature (which, in tsetse, is equivalent to maternal gestational
temperature) and smaller size of offspring is well established in other ectotherms
(reviewed in [Atkinson 1994], e.g. [Crill et al. 1996, Fischer at al. 2003]), likely due to
an acceleration of biochemical processes underlying growth, which reduces
development time and leads to smaller size at maturity [Zuo et al. 2011]."
(iii) we have added an analysis showing that increasing temperatures have a larger
effect on reduced pupal size in G. pallidipes than in G. m. morsitans.
2) The title is misleading, as it only states the name of Glossina pallidipes Austen, but in
the manuscript the data for Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood is also presented.
The title has been changed, as indicated above: we have added the words “and G. m.
morsitans Westwood” to the end of the original.
3) Aim of the study (here aims of the analysis) should be explained in the introduction
not in the Material and Methods.
Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have moved the sub-section to the
Introduction, and changed the title to “Aims of the study”
4) Could the paternal investment have a role? I know, that this was not the aim of the
study, but could be relevant as well.
We expect paternal investment to play a very minor role, if any, in this system. As far
as we are aware, there has never been any suggestion in the literature that there is any
interaction between deposited larvae, or pupae, and adult tsetse of either sex. And the
only interaction between adults of the two genders takes place during the protracted
period when male and female copulate. The only “paternal investment” that could be
envisaged relates to the quality of the sperm or other components of the seminal fluid
that he transfers to the female(s) with whom he mates.
We have changed part of the Introduction (new lines 58 - 65) to read:
“The level of parental care provided for each offspring by its mother is thus
completely measured by the amount of fat and protein the female transfers to its larva.
There is no known interaction between adult male tsetse and pupa and the only known
interaction between adult males and females occurs during copulation – which, for
most females, occurs only once in her life. The male’s contribution to parental
investment seems therefore to be limited to the sperm, and components of seminal
fluid [Scolari et al. 2016], that he transfers to the female during mating.”
5) Line – 45 – What do authors mean by absolute maternal investment here, is the body
size only measure? Clarify.
We have changed the structure of this paragraph in an attempt to make a clearer
juxtaposition of “absolute” and “relative” maternal investment. The passage in
question now reads:
“Moreover, most studies consider absolute maternal investment (for example, the size
of offspring produced), as opposed to relative maternal investment (for example, the
proportion of biomass or nutrients transferred from mother to young). As older
females tend to have greater access to resources [Clutton-Brock 1984], understanding
age-related changes in reproductive effort also requires consideration of absolute and
relative investment.”
6) Lines 53 – 61. First it is said, that tse tse fly females only produce a single offspring,
later, that they produce several. I understand, that it is meant, that females produce a
single larvae at a time, but can produce many over the course of time. Please make
this more clear.
We accept that our wording is confusing. We have changed the offending sentence to
read:
“They produce, at each birth event, a single offspring, which develops into a full-sized
adult with no post-birth feeding and no care from either parent. The level of parental
care provided for each offspring by its mother is thus completely measured by the
amount of fat and protein the female transfers to its larva. Taken together this makes
them nearly unique among metazoan animals.”
7) Lines 79 – 83. Does the claim made about the difference in the sample size and later
in the statistics regarding two different Glossiana species indicate that the results are
due to the increased sample size, and could be considered as false positive?
Whereas it is never possible to exclude entirely the possibility of a false positive
result, in this case the problem appears to be quite the opposite. Given the large
variation in pupal dry weight it is more likely that the small sample size for G. m.
morsitans was too small to allow us to detect an effect of age even if one existed.
Given the large confidence intervals for the pupal dry weight for G. pallidipes (Figure
2) it appears that, even for this species, it would have been preferable to have a larger
sample size. It seems unlikely, therefore, that the estimated age effect is a false
positive result. We note that, in any case, we have already been cautious in assessing
the effect of age – noting, for example:
“When ovarian category was included as a categorical variable, puparial dry weight
increased over the first five pregnancies (Fig. 2A), but the major age effect was
limited to the difference between the dry weight of the first pupa and the dry
weight of all later pupae. When the analyses were re-run excluding data for the
first pupa, there was no effect of ovarian age on puparial dry weight.” [Our
emphasis].
Given that we have not made strong claims about the age effect it does not seem
necessary to further discuss the power, or sample size, issue in the main text.
8) Lines 85 – 90 should be brought in the beginning of the introduction or deleted, as the
last paragraph could explain the aims of the study. Why it is important to study tse tse
fly, could come before.
We agree that the first sentence, reading: “Tsetse are the sole vectors of the
trypanosome parasites that cause debilitating nagana in livestock and fatal sleeping
sickness in humans (reviewed in [23])” is misplaced. We have included an abbreviated
version of this earlier in the Introduction (new lines 54 - 56), which now reads:
“Viviparous tsetse (Glossina species), vectors of the trypanosomes causing nagana in
livestock and sleeping sickness in humans [Maudlin et al. 2004], present a valuable
test of age-related reproductive allocation theory because they are relatively long-
lived and exhibit high maternal investment.”
The remainder of the section in the old lines 85-90 has been left in situ, since it refers
to the preceding paragraph. As noted above (response to comment 3), we have also
reorganised the text so that, as suggested here, “the last paragraph ... explain[s] the
aims of the study”.
9) Lines 104 – 110. How long did you wait until female laid a larvae? Was this
monitored somehow? If some females laid a larvae immediately and some took longer,
how did you control for the female environment, as an factor for reproductive
investment? As we could argue, that the ones who laid immediately would be making
their investment decision based on what they experienced before capture (as larvae
should be almost fully developed) and the ones who took longer (larvae still
underdeveloped and needs transfer of nutrients from mother) might be affected by
experimental conditions.
We need to be clear that we did not wait at all “until female laid a larvae”. Flies were
dissected as quickly as possible after capture, regardless of whether or not they had
produced a larva. We have made the following change to the text to clarify this
situation:
“Adult females were dissected to score ovarian category as a measure of age. Flies
were dissected, in a random order, as soon as possible after transfer to the laboratory:
>95% of captured flies were processed on the day of capture, and within ~ 4h of
capture. We did not delay dissection to allow a female to complete larviposition.”
10) Lines 114 – 121. It is not clear how accurately the authors can estimate the age of the
wild caught individuals. And as this is supposed to be one of the central aspects of the
study, I think it is really important to get this right. The method concerning the
estimation based on the ovarian development is unconvincing in my opinion. By
dissecting the individuals of the same age, the great variation in ovarian size and
development can be seen. In my experience, sometimes, up to 40% of sister individuals
for example have poor ovaries, regardless mating status and age. Later there is
description about the ovulation number estimation, but is not clear how this is related
to age and experiment. I cannot evaluate the method based on the wing fray scoring,
as the article referring to it is from artificial rearing study (according to the title) from
1946 and not available online. However, I am wondering, how is the captive study a
good estimate for measuring the age in the wild?
We agree with the Reviewer that it is important to establish the accuracy of the
methods used in this study for the estimation of the age of female tsetse. In fact,
however, the accuracy of ovarian dissection, and the relative merits of ovarian
dissection and wing fray analysis, have been well established in the tsetse literature
over the past 40 years. Accordingly, we do not think that we should overload the main
text with an extensive rehashing of the evidence.
Nonetheless, we accept that our description of the assessment of age is too perfunctory
and assumes too much knowledge on the part of the general reader. Given also the
Reviewer’s misgivings, we have expanded the Methods section to point out the merits,
and problems, associated with the use of ovarian dissection and wing fray analysis for
estimating the absolute and relative ages of female tsetse. This discussion shows that
the accuracy of the ovarian dissection method far exceeds our requirements and is not
a problematic issue for our study.
We address below, some of the specific issues raised by the Reviewer.
Ovarian dissection
While the Reviewer states that: “The method concerning the estimation based on the
ovarian development is unconvincing in my opinion. By dissecting the individuals of
the same age, the great variation in ovarian size and development can be seen”, we
can only assume that he/she is referring to his/her own experience with insects other
than tsetse. This is not the experience of those who have worked on the ovarian
dissection of tsetse flies. Recapture of known-aged flies, released in the field and then
recaptured, demonstrates that, contrary to the Reviewer’s experience, the ovarian size
shows remarkably little variation (e.g., Rogers et al., 1984). As a consequence it is
entirely possible to use ovarian dissection to get the ages of tsetse accurate to the
nearest few days (see also below).
Rogers, D. J., Randolph, S. E. & Kuzoe, F. A. S. (1984). Local variation in the
population dynamics of Glossina palpalis palpalis (Robineau-Desvoidy) (Diptera:
Glossinidae). I. Natural population regulation. Bulletin of Entomological Research, 74,
403-423.
Similarly, while the Reviewer states that “In my experience, sometimes, up to 40% of
sister individuals for example have poor ovaries, regardless mating status and age”,
this is at variance with the experience of workers studying tsetse. Indeed, a study
carried out by one of us (Hargrove, 1999) reviewed the results of the ovarian
dissection of <U+F07E>140.000 female tsetse and found that, on average, “Major abnormalities
and abnormal spermathecal contents were found in <0.1% of all flies dissected.”
Hargrove, J. W. (1999) Reproductive abnormalities in field tsetse flies in Zimbabwe.
Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata, 92, 89-99.
The Reviewer is also concerned that: “Later there is description about the ovulation
number estimation, but is not clear how this is related to age and experiment.”
We have reorganised the section of the Methods dealing with ovarian dissection and
wing fray analysis to indicate more clearly how numbers of ovulations relates to
chronological age. Previous studies indicate that the very predictable rate at which the
oocytes, and uterine contents, grow in female tsetse during pregnancy make it entirely
possible to predict the age of a fly to the nearest few days.
We do not, however, require this level of accuracy. As is clear from Figures 1 and 2,
we only require that the fly is placed in the correct ovarian category – in other words
that we get the age correct to the nearest 8 to 10 days.
Wing fray
The Reviewer notes that: “I cannot evaluate the method based on the wing fray
scoring, as the article referring to it is from artificial rearing study (according to the
title) from 1946 and not available online. However, I am wondering, how is the
captive study a good estimate for measuring the age in the wild?
It is unfortunate that the Reviewer was unable to access Jackson’s (1946) paper. The
Abstract of this paper is, however, available via Google Scholar. Even from the
Abstract, it is clear that the experiment in question was not an “artificial rearing
study”. The word “artificial” in the title refers to the fact that the study concerns
“Artificially isolated generations of tsetse” (my emphasis). That is to say, (wild) pupae
of one species were collected and released in the habitat of a different species. So,
contrary to the (understandable) assumption of the Reviewer, this was not a “captive
study”. The study flies were allowed to emerge in the wild and the wing fray of flies of
known age, which had been living in the wild, was then assessed.
The advantage of this experimental design was that Jackson did not need to mark –
and therefore did not need to handle – the flies he was releasing, since the released
species did not naturally occur in the release area. Since, also, flies were only released
over a 2-day period, Jackson knew the chronological age of all recaptured flies to the
nearest day or so. He was thereby able to derive a very nice relationship between
chronological age and the degree of fray of the wings.
Jackson’s data do therefore apply to field, rather than laboratory, situations and are
entirely germane to our own study. Moreover, as indicated above, it is important to
have an alternative estimate of fly age given the fact that flies that have ovulated more
than three times can only be classified to an ovarian category modulo 4. Finally, wing
fray may provide some measure of the “stress” experienced by the fly which is not
reflected by its ovarian age.
In light of the above considerations, and to explain our approach more clearly, we
have reorganised the section of the Methods dealing with the estimation of age. We
have expanded on the essential limitation of the ovarian dissection method as applied
to tsetse – viz., that, once a female has ovulated four times, we can only assess the
number of ovulations modulo 4. We point out that it is for this reason that we also
used the wing fray method as an alternative method for estimating age.
11) Line 164 says Aims of analysis. Which analysis? Is this about the environmental
factors? It should be stated so. Also, I cannot follow, how the females based on
capture date are divided into different environmental conditions? Please clarify.
As indicated above in the response to Point 3, we have renamed this section “Aims of
the study” and have, as suggested moved the section to the Introduction.
We accept that we need to clarify the issue of “how the females based on capture date
are divided into different environmental conditions”.
What we should have made clearer is that what we are testing here is the effect of the
different environmental factors experienced by the female while she is pregnant. We
have altered the text to clarify this issue. Thus in the Introduction we add the
highlighted text:
“A recent study on Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood in field conditions found
that aspects of maternal physiological, and the environmental states experienced by
the female during pregnancy, correlate with offspring size according to predictions
based on theory [18].”
Similarly we have altered text in the section now headed “Aims of the study”
“We also expected, as in G. m. morsitans [18], that females experiencing stressful
environmental conditions (e.g., high temperature) during pregnancy would allocate
fewer nutrients to their current offspring.”
We have made a similar change to the first sentence of the Conclusion:
“Our work shows that aspects of female condition, and the environment she
experiences during pregnancy, are important in determining the size of offspring
produced in viviparous tsetse.
12) Lines 226 -227 – what is first pupal dry weight and all later pupal weight? Did
females produce multiple larvae. Sorry, I do not get it…
Since all females were dissected on capture it is clear that we only ever saw one pupa
from each individual female. We have added the following sentences to the Methods
section in an effort to clarify this situation:
“In estimating the relationship between the age of a female and the size of the
offspring she produces one would like, ideally, to collect series of pupae produced by
the same fly. Since, however, all females were dissected on capture we only saw one
pupa from each individual female. Accordingly we can only compare the sizes of
pupae produced by different flies at their first, second, third, and so on, attempt. The
effect of age is adjusted for maternal condition and the environmental factors
experienced by the female during pregnancy.”
13) Lines 331 – 333 – the sentence about the wing fray and fat levels linked to age seems
wrong – “ “significant decrease with age in fat levels”
The original sentence read: “When wing-fray was used as a measure of age, however,
there was a significant decrease with age in the postpartum fat levels in G. pallidipes.”
In other words, postpartum fat decreased with increasing wing fray category. We do
not see the problem with what we have written. However, it may be clearer phrased as
follows: "When wing-fray was used as a measure of age, however, we found that
postpartum fat levels decreased significantly in G. pallidipes females with more frayed
wings."
14) Lines 330 – 333 – so, do the results depend on which parameter was used as a
reflection of age? If so, more research is needed to find out, which one is a correct
one, as it is not clear which one is a correct one.
The results are not necessarily contradictory, but we agree with the Reviewer that
further work is required to tease out the various effects of age, per se, and wing fray.
In order to make these points, we have added the following sentences to this part of
the Discussion.
“The different relationships between postpartum fat and age, as measured by ovarian
age and wing fray, are not necessarily inconsistent. While there is a high correlation
between ovarian age and wing fray, the correlation is not perfect. Conditions
experienced by individual flies, and chance events, will inevitably mean that flies of
the same chronological age suffer different levels of wing fray. Our results are
consistent with the idea that the degree of wing fray is a better index than
chronological age of the stress suffered by the female and that this stress is reflected in
her postpartum fat levels. Nonetheless, further work is required to tease out the
various effects of age, per se, and wing fray on maternal condition and on absolute and
relative levels of maternal investment.”
15) Lines 388 – 409 – the last paragraph tries to link the study to the climate change.
Although relevant, I would decrease the amount of text in the paragraph and make a
simpler speculation about the effects of the climate change on the tse tse populations
in the location.
We have, as suggested, simplified the paragraph in question and have removed
references to the modelling efforts, which are still in progress. Note that we have also
incorporated a discussion of the additional analysis where we consider species
differences in the effect of maternal pregnancy temperature on offspring size, with the
effects being more severe in the larger G. pallidipes than G. m. morsitans.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
<U+F0B7> This is an interesting study investigating how maternal age, environmental factors,
and physiological factors influence reproductive investment in wild tsetse. The
manuscript is generally well written and well organised.
We thank the Reviewer for this positive approach to our work.
<U+F0B7> I have one major criticism: in the Introduction, you set out the aim of your study,
which is to investigate reproductive investment strategies in G. pallidipes, and in the
Methods, you describe how you collected and dissected these G. pallipides flies.
However, in the Results (L261-262), you say “Results are shown for the present G.
pallidipes data and also for previously published data for G. m. morsitans.” From
then onwards, in the Results and Discussion, you shift the focus of your study to a
comparison between G. pallidipes and G. m. morsitans. In my opinion, this creates a
big disconnect between the different sections and will undoubtedly confuse readers.
We accept this criticism. As indicated in response to the Editor and to Reviewer 1, we
have dealt with the matter.
Additional comments:
1) L59: I think this should be “a female” rather than “the female”
Agreed.
2) L74-76: As someone who is not familiar with this study system, I did not understand
this part when I first read it (you talk about the baits in the Methods further down, and
it makes sense then).
Agreed that this should be clarified at first mention. We have changed the sentence to
read:
“The two species also differ in their behaviour, with G. pallidipes being more likely
than G. m. morsitans to approach stationary baits, such as odour-baited traps, and
relatively less likely to approach mobile baits, such as oxen accompanied by men
[19].”
3) L79-81: Edit for clarity.
We have clarified this sentence as follows: "For G. m. morsitans, we found a weak
trend suggesting that investment tends to increase with age. We have a larger sample
size for G. pallidipes, and thus greater statistical power to investigate this finding
further."
4) L170: This should be “she had just produced.”
Agreed.
5) L280: The first sentence of your Discussion should (generally) be a summary of your
most important finding(s), so I find this sentence weak.
We agree that the first sentence was rather weak and have tried to improve it.
6) L367-369: “This is because there must be an upper limit to the benefits of producing
large offspring and, beyond some (unspecified) size, further increases in pupal size
will cause a decrease in pupal fitness.” I agree with the first part of this sentence, but
I do not understand the second part. Why would a larger pupal size be
disadvantageous to the pupa? More explanation is needed here.
The Reviewer is clearly correct. There is no reason to expect that larger pupae will be
at a disadvantage. The problem arises for the adult. If there is an upper limit for the
size of an adult fly then females producing pupae of a size that give rise to adults
bigger than this upper limit will leave reduced numbers of surviving offspring.
We have modified the text to read as follows – the final sentence of the paragraph,
particularly, addressing the point raised by the Reviewer:
“That being the case, smaller or less-well-nourished females will need to use a greater
proportion of their reserves to ensure that the pupa they produce is greater than the
minimum size. These smaller females will, however, endanger their own survival if
they transfer a larger proportion of reserves than is the minimum necessary for
offspring survival. Thus, in tsetse, the explanation for larger females producing larger
offspring may simply be because larger females can afford to transfer these reserves
without jeopardizing their own chances of surviving to breed again. Equally, if it is
true that there is a size of these adult flies above which individuals have lower survival
probability then mothers should not produce pupae so large that they give rise to
adults larger than this limit.
7) Tables 1 and 2: The CI column is hard to read because the dashes and minuses look
the same. Perhaps consider having the lower and upper CI bounds in different
columns.
Done.
8) The figures are aesthetically pleasing overall, but the axes look somewhat crowded
(especially the x-axis and y-axis in Figure 3).
We have reduced the labelling on Figure 3.
