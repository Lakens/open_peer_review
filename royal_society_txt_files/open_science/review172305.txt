This is a polished paper that, with its multiple year comparison, provides new information on
how songs may reflect humpback whale population interactions. In my view it warrants
publication -- however, I do have questions and some issues..
These are:
1. Sample Size
The sample size, i.e. the number of individuals recorded, is small to very small and this weakens
the quantitative analyses presented (which are a large focus of the paper) –(it weakens the
qualitative analyses as well). In 2002 Gabon a single whale sampled is clearly not enough to
declare it representative of the population. It could be? – or, it might not be?. There are examples
in the literature of individual singers not singing the full repertoire of the ‘population’s’ song
during one song session, and others whose song is quite aberrant compared to the general
population. Just two individuals sampled in Gabon 2001 and Madagascar 2001 and 2002 is not
much better. The samples in the other years, from 3 or 4 individuals, are more convincing (but
only because of the well documented similarity of most songs in a population at any one time)
I wondered why the 2001-2002 data was even included – when the main point of the paper can be
easily made with the 2003-2005 data, (still with a small, but defendable sample size).
Table 1 requires more information in order to judge the sample used. It should include date of
recording, length of recording, and the number of song cycles recorded (if the recording of the
single whale in 2001 was long and included many song cycles it may be more representative than
just one cycle). The dates are important with such a small sample size, as without them we
cannot tell if the recordings were made at beginning of season, or end of season, or spread
throughout season – which may be a factor in composition of the songs – and bias the
comparisons.
I find it somewhat troubling that the 2002 comparison with smallest sample leads to the least
similarity between populations ( L 229) . This could easily be the result of a too small a sample:
one whale’s song is just not adequate to make this conclusion.
2. Description of Methods
I read through the Methods several times in attempt to follow the process… and I think some
further explanation/clarification could help a lot. I’m a fan of succinctness but this paper is one of
the few I have seen that, in my view at least, takes this notion too far. Perhaps this is the style of
the journal (which I am not that familiar with) and the reader is expected to get much of the
3
information from supplementary material or elsewhere, but at very least, enough information
should be included in body of the text so a reader can follow it. In most cases this can be
corrected with the addition of a sentence or two at several points in the text.
Some examples:
L 140-141: I realize this is a classic definition of the song – but it is not uncommon for some
alternation/repetitiveness of themes in one song cycle e.g. 1234345. Did this not occur in this
sample? If it did then this definition of song needs a caveat.
L 157-161: This needs to be better explained. Once you had the alpha/numeric transcription of
the composition – then you ‘qualitatively’ applied rules for determination of a median string and
the rule was a unit or phrase was included (in the median string) if present in 50% or more of an
individual’s song… Questions: Are you looking at units or phrases, or both? Does this mean that,
for example, a phrase has to be in over 50% of the song cycle to be included? This seems to be
what it says (or does it mean that the phrase has to be in more than 50% of the song cycles of an
individual?). Certainly some phrases may comprise 50% or more of song but others are
consistently 10 or 20 or 40 %. What happens to them – just not included? This does not make any
sense at all to me. So I am presuming I do not understand this process of getting a median string
--- which would suggest some clarification is necessary. A few more sentences and perhaps a
figure to define the process would be helpful here
L173-188: Again – a little clarification would go a long way here. Is this song comparison based
on phrases (as inferred in L 153), or units as is apparent in this paragraph. Perhaps it is both? Or,
is this exercise solely for the purpose of testing the qualitative/human definition of units – in
other words its purpose more to promote quantitative analyses than for the purpose of the song
comparisons? As is stated earlier (L 153), some variability in units within a phrase is not
uncommon – but the pattern of units within the phrase is stable. But it seems the pattern is not
the metric analyzed here, but rather the variability in the units? If clarified, this analysis is okay I
guess, it’s interesting – but I’m not sold on its necessity to make the points in the paper.
L190-206: As this paragraph is the key to the results, I feel this description overall is too brief to
follow for a typical reader. It seems one has to be very familiar with the Garland papers
(including one ‘in review’) to judge this process. The term ‘terminal node’ requires a little more
clarification in the context of this study - as clearly it is the bottom line of the study.
L 194: ‘Each individuals median theme sequence’ -- does not the reliability of this value depend
on the number of song cycles that are recorded? Singers can omit themes in any one song cycle –
although rarely do this over multiple cycles. I think we need to know how many song cycles went
into developing an individuals median theme --- especially because samples sizes for an entire
region for an entire season are just 1 or 2 individuals in some cases!
3. Presentation overall – I appreciate the efforts at quantification of the song comparison process
(although would be much happier with samples sizes were larger), but I miss the more
‘traditional’ descriptive comparisons used in most papers on the topic, using charts and graphs
that allow immediate visualization of song similarities and differences. Why not do both?
Other Comments
Table 2: Were only some of the year to year/same location comparisons made, or were they all
4
made and most have 0 similarity? (I went through the paper looking for an explanation of this –
but if there I could not find it). If only some of them were analyzed (those in bold) please explain
why not all? And then, if this is the case and only some to the year to year same location songs
compared, why are the very low similarities say between Gabon 2002 to 2003 or 2003 to 2004
(20%) not discussed in the paper? That is it appears song can be more similar between oceans in
some years than in one location from one year to the next. Is this correct? This seems to suggest a
much more dynamic process than just the ‘degree of mixing’ between the populations? I think
this all warrants further presentation and discussion in the paper – rather than being ‘buried’ in
the Table?
Line 80: Not sure we have any idea how songs are learned. This sentence may need a little more
finesse
Line 150: Is this line intended to say: “If a theme consisted of two or more phrases…” or is it a
typo? If intended I think more explanation is needed: Is not the definition of a theme the same
phrase repeated? Do some of the songs analyzed have more than one type of phrase composition
in them? Or, do you mean to say that - a theme consisted of multiple repetitions of one phrase?
I’m not sure it matters which one it is but an explanation of a phrase, how one is defined from
another, and how many are in one theme is necessary here.
Line 227: it says here, “ Overall, songs were similar within and between populations… Am I
misreading, or misunderstanding something here. It appears to me that the data in Table 2 says
there is a huge range in degree of similarity year to year within and between…
L241-243: I do not understand the statement here. The ‘lowest similarity’ discussed here is likely
DUE to the limited sample size, not ‘despite the limited sample size’ as stated. This is followed by
a speculative sentence that I’d suggest deleting entirely, but if not – is it not true that with a larger
sample size it’s more likely a better representative of the song would be obtained, which then
may, or may not, be grouped into one vocal population?
Line 263: I believe this is the first mention of the number of shared phrases between the
populations. I think this is interesting/important but this data should be presented in the Results
(that is, the number of shared phrases year to year and place to place) not just appear in the
Discussion Or perhaps this is in another paper and a reference in missing?
Figure 3: Several questions: why are just these two years given – presumably as examples for
some reason? What do the numbers/letters mean on each phrase? Why are they not in order? Is
that the full recording of the only sample in Gabon 2002? The caption needs FAR more
explanation of the purpose of the figure and the meaning of the labels.

The paper has many problems. The sample size is extremely and insufficiently small such that
this paper's results are highly qualified. The text significantly understates the extremely high
variability in humpback song, and the sample size does nothing but undermine the papers
overstated conclusions. As stated in the abstract "However, these results provide a more detailed
understanding of song exchange between these two populations..." To claim detailed
understanding of humpback song based on 477 calls from 30 singers over five years is a very
serious under representation of song variability in an animal whose males are well known for
their extremely high singing virtuosity. This is a reflection of the paper's fundamental weakness.
Might I suggest that the authors consider redoing this paper so as to include a comparative song
note analysis that is both quantitative (not subjective as this is) and uses as its reference, songs
from humpbacks recorded in a place and in years very distant from these two regions and
periods of time. This might provide an actual reference frame by which to assess the results from
comparative analysis of these two, very small samples. No one doubts that humpback males can
and in some cases do share songs across populations. What this paper seems to be trying to
advertise is that this situation off Africa is either unique or deserves greater attention, but this is
not a unique situation, is it? Isn't it really a reflection of where the research was/is conducted,
and not a fundamental scientific question germane to singers off Africa?

The three referees have all raised substantial issues with this manuscript, and it is a long way
from being publishable in its current form. The authors should be given an opportunity to
consider and revise according to the helpful comments and criticisms raised (though this will
take quite a bit of work). It is an interesting paper, to be sure; but it needs considerable work
before it can be considered publishable.

Generally, I believe the conclusions of this paper – and I think if the authors were to tread
carefully it could be an important addition to the literature, however they have not (treaded
carefully)… The paper still suffers from very small sample sizes combined with (perhaps overly
and arguably unnecessary) complex quantitative analysis, which gets it onto very thin ice. The
impression I have is that they knew the points they want to discuss and were determined to get
there – regardless of the underlying weaknesses of some of the data. This is not to say the points
are not important and accurate (and might well be the same reached with better sample sizes).
Hence it’s frustrating to review.
The authors added more basic data (such as details on samples), clarifications on methodology
and new presentations of information not in the first version and these are welcome
improvements. I am not going to go through each response: in my view some were adequate;
others less so. However the authors have chosen to argue several of the fundamental issues I had
with the first version rather than change anything. I understand/respect this approach but,
considering the level of quantitative analyses in the paper, I did not buy the sample size
arguments… this now an editorial decision.
Example: the main defense to the criticism that the sample size is small in some cases is that
“…there were no more samples available to analyze.” Unfortunately this does not solve the
sample size problem, especially considering the quantitative analysis undertaken. I wish it did.
To solve it only two choices: 1) increase sample size or 2) do not do the analysis. Neither was
option taken.
Example: In addressing the comments on version #1 the authors have added key information to
Table 1 -- however a statement in their response increased rather than lessoned my questioning
of this. They state that the data is “…more than a decade old…” and “… do not have the date of
the recordings”. So this particular element of the study is based on one undated recording from
more than 10 years ago? --- a fact we only learned after questioning of the first version ?
I have increasing (although not conclusive) reservations about the value of the Levenshtein Index
– or more specifically, the treatment the song requires for usability in this index. If used, there
needs to be a justification for its use, beyond that is what others are doing. For example, what is
the justification for simply ‘not using’ songs where the order of the themes was not the straight
12345, beyond the fact that this disorder screws up the LI calculation? In some cases
(locations/years) repetitiveness or alternation of the themes is more the rule than the exception.
How many songs were discarded due to this characteristic? And, I still do not understand the
justification for eliminating phrases not in 50% of song cycles (beyond that it makes the LI index
work). Where does this get us in the real comparison of the song composition?
In reading though the comments of the other reviewers and the authors responses I found myself
mostly agreeing with the reviewers – and with mixed acceptance of the authors explanations,
changes or arguments. My summary: I think the information in the paper is fundamentally legit
and would like to see it published in some form --- but the small (ranging to unacceptable)
sample sizes (with no attempt to restructure the paper after this criticism), in combination with
complex (and difficult to describe/justify) analysis and a tendency to overstate some of the
results in Discussion makes it very difficult to recommend in this form.

General comments:
The authors have made a good faith attempt to address many of my concerns as expressed in my
review of their first submission of this paper. Alas, the two most fundamental of these concerns
remain, and those are: a) the extremely small amount of acoustic data and b) the highly subjective
and inadequate nature of the acoustic feature analyses by which the authors derive metrics for
song sharing.
I'm pretty certain that my continued low evaluation of this paper in its present form will be
frustrating for the authors, just as I am adamant that the present combination of subjective
assessment of humpback song unit types and a seriously inadequate set of acoustic features for
classifying unit types is insufficient for a high resolution unit comparison attempt. What the
authors need to do is come up with an acoustic feature set for song units that has a high
likelihood of providing a quantitative measure of similarity-difference. Without conquering this
first step, and especially given the anemic sample size, no amount of CART and LSI analysis will
return a defensible result.
On a more positive perspective. I do not doubt actually that male singers in these two
populations share song features, most likely at multiple song levels (i.e., notes, phrases).
Humpback males singers, are known to be very labile in their song learning behaviors. They sing
throughout many, many months of the year while in pretty much all regions of their annual
movement cycles. As nicely discussed by the authors, the inclusion of acoustics as a measure of
population interchange, at least for breeding males, is important, especially when integrated with
evidence from other tools (biopsy, photo-ID), because it can provide evidence of cultural
interchange at very short time scales. My concern then is that this paper, if published as is, would
support the continued use of impoverished acoustic analysis methods that were prevalent and
semi-acceptable in the last century. Such methods should not be encouraged today. These
methods cannot reveal features of humpback behavioral acoustic ecology that could actually
enable deeper levels of hypothesis testing, for example, elucidate whether or not singing is an

index or handicap signal. Regarding my plea for adequate feature analysis, I'm pretty certain that
the authors do not have the resources to complete any new acoustic analysis.
Given lack of resources, what do I suggest if this reanalysis is too much to bear and the authors
want to resubmit? Do a much, much better job of showing unit type similarities and differences.
As the figures and tables presently stand, it is not possible for me (and I suspect even the
unsophisticated reader) to adequately discern the authors' judgements about unit type sharing by
looking at spectrograms. The examples in the Figure 3 are tiny and presented in an odd way (sort
of like a gel?). Why is there not a figure that shows clear examples of song sharing between places
and years? If I cannot observe and evaluate at that level, then all the bells and whistles that follow
bring little to no weight to the paper's claims of song sharing with such an tiny sample size. A
similar component of any rewrite is that the paper needs to unambiguously from the beginning
and throughout clearly acknowledge the very, very limited amount of acoustic data. Also, in the
methods, there needs to be a clear an unambiguous admission as to the limits of their feature
measurement process, which by its very nature blurs distinctions between song units such that it
lumps at a rather gross level.
The file I attach is the PDF version of the paper with my many comments. I do this rather than
write out a separate list. One of those needs to be repeated here and adequately addressed in any
rewite/resubmission.
On line 306 I comment: "You cannot say that these data represent song at the population level
with totals of 14 singers (Gabon ) and 16 singers (Madagascar) over a 5 year sampling period
(average recording 54.7 min SD 35 min Gabon, 87.3 min SD 38 min Madagascar). These data
represent song at the level of a few individuals whose songs were evaluated based on very brief
acoustic samples (Gabon 58 songs, ave 4.1 SD 2.8/singer; Madagascar 78 songs, ave 4.8 SD
2.1/singer). Placing these results within the proper data level is imperative. This is not a
population level acoustic comparison of song similarity. It was an attempt at that level, but does
not in any way pass the litmus test of a population level comparison. It points to and perhaps
suggests a possible population level interchange, but the acoustic analytics are insufficient for this
comparison because they are too subjective and the sample size is too small. The figures for the
results are insufficient and do not demonstrate an adequate comparative level by which to
conclude acoustic similarity. The features used in the comparative analysis do not yield acoustic
identities: that is, you cannot use these feature sets alone to regenerate the sounds they represent.
As a result, the feature measurement process intrinsically lumps sounds together and is not well
designed to enable adequate differentiation between different unit types.
The discussion makes some very appropriate points and is pretty much on target. The references
are pretty thorough, but i did not cross check with text.

Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Generally, I believe the conclusions of this paper – and I think if the authors were to tread
carefully it could be an important addition to the literature, however they have not (treaded
carefully)… The paper still suffers from very small sample sizes combined with (perhaps overly
and arguably unnecessary) complex quantitative analysis, which gets it onto very thin ice. The
impression I have is that they knew the points they want to discuss and were determined to get
there – regardless of the underlying weaknesses of some of the data. This is not to say the points
are not important and accurate (and might well be the same reached with better sample sizes).
Hence it’s frustrating to review.
The authors added more basic data (such as details on samples), clarifications on methodology
and new presentations of information not in the first version and these are welcome
improvements. I am not going to go through each response: in my view some were adequate;
others less so. However the authors have chosen to argue several of the fundamental issues I had
with the first version rather than change anything. I understand/respect this approach but,
considering the level of quantitative analyses in the paper, I did not buy the sample size
arguments… this now an editorial decision.
Example: the main defense to the criticism that the sample size is small in some cases is that
“…there were no more samples available to analyze.” Unfortunately this does not solve the
sample size problem, especially considering the quantitative analysis undertaken. I wish it did.
To solve it only two choices: 1) increase sample size or 2) do not do the analysis. Neither was
option taken.
Example: In addressing the comments on version #1 the authors have added key information to
Table 1 -- however a statement in their response increased rather than lessoned my questioning
17
of this. They state that the data is “…more than a decade old…” and “… do not have the date of
the recordings”. So this particular element of the study is based on one undated recording from
more than 10 years ago? --- a fact we only learned after questioning of the first version ?
I have increasing (although not conclusive) reservations about the value of the Levenshtein Index
– or more specifically, the treatment the song requires for usability in this index. If used, there
needs to be a justification for its use, beyond that is what others are doing. For example, what is
the justification for simply ‘not using’ songs where the order of the themes was not the straight
12345, beyond the fact that this disorder screws up the LI calculation? In some cases
(locations/years) repetitiveness or alternation of the themes is more the rule than the exception.
How many songs were discarded due to this characteristic? And, I still do not understand the
justification for eliminating phrases not in 50% of song cycles (beyond that it makes the LI index
work). Where does this get us in the real comparison of the song composition?
In reading though the comments of the other reviewers and the authors responses I found myself
mostly agreeing with the reviewers – and with mixed acceptance of the authors explanations,
changes or arguments. My summary: I think the information in the paper is fundamentally legit
and would like to see it published in some form --- but the small (ranging to unacceptable)
sample sizes (with no attempt to restructure the paper after this criticism), in combination with
complex (and difficult to describe/justify) analysis and a tendency to overstate some of the
results in Discussion makes it very difficult to recommend in this form.

Comments to the Author(s)
General comments:
The authors have made a good faith attempt to address many of my concerns as expressed in my
review of their first submission of this paper. Alas, the two most fundamental of these concerns
remain, and those are: a) the extremely small amount of acoustic data and b) the highly subjective
and inadequate nature of the acoustic feature analyses by which the authors derive metrics for
song sharing.
I'm pretty certain that my continued low evaluation of this paper in its present form will be
frustrating for the authors, just as I am adamant that the present combination of subjective
assessment of humpback song unit types and a seriously inadequate set of acoustic features for
classifying unit types is insufficient for a high resolution unit comparison attempt. What the
authors need to do is come up with an acoustic feature set for song units that has a high
likelihood of providing a quantitative measure of similarity-difference. Without conquering this
first step, and especially given the anemic sample size, no amount of CART and LSI analysis will
return a defensible result.
On a more positive perspective. I do not doubt actually that male singers in these two
populations share song features, most likely at multiple song levels (i.e., notes, phrases).
Humpback males singers, are known to be very labile in their song learning behaviors. They sing
throughout many, many months of the year while in pretty much all regions of their annual
movement cycles. As nicely discussed by the authors, the inclusion of acoustics as a measure of
18
population interchange, at least for breeding males, is important, especially when integrated with
evidence from other tools (biopsy, photo-ID), because it can provide evidence of cultural
interchange at very short time scales. My concern then is that this paper, if published as is, would
support the continued use of impoverished acoustic analysis methods that were prevalent and
semi-acceptable in the last century. Such methods should not be encouraged today. These
methods cannot reveal features of humpback behavioral acoustic ecology that could actually
enable deeper levels of hypothesis testing, for example, elucidate whether or not singing is an
index or handicap signal. Regarding my plea for adequate feature analysis, I'm pretty certain that
the authors do not have the resources to complete any new acoustic analysis.
Given lack of resources, what do I suggest if this reanalysis is too much to bear and the authors
want to resubmit? Do a much, much better job of showing unit type similarities and differences.
As the figures and tables presently stand, it is not possible for me (and I suspect even the

I'm encouraged by the improvements in the MS and honest attempts to increase the analyses,
while reducing the over-interpretations and over-statements. Two fundamental problems with
this paper remain, and despite the author's best efforts to work around them, one cannot be
resolved and resolving the other is too onerous and maybe unnecessary. For one problem, the
small amount of acoustic song samples and individuals, there is nothing that could be done, but
they did make the extra effort to analyze as much of the data as possible. The second problem is
the application of techniques that deal with sequences of alphabetical symbols, i.e. Levenshtein
and Dice, as representations of a complex bioacoustic phenomena. In this paper, the method of
labeling song notes-themes remains fairly abstract and there is only one, highly compressed
figure showing spectrographic examples of some themes. This is a weak link in the analytical
process, and it happens at the critical step of converting the phenomenon of song into a form that
the Levenshtein and Dice analytics require. I am most certain that if they took their translation of
songs into sequences of letters and converted those back into actual songs, those songs would not
sound anything like the originals. In other words, a fundamental, and in my opinion essential
characteristic of song is lost in their translation from the acoustic domain into their symbolic
coding. Alas, the one visual representations of song themes (Figure 3) is so compressed and so
selectively incomplete that I am left to "take their word for it": i.e. their conclusions from
Levenshtein and Dice algorithm alalyses. They might consider addressing the limitations of this
approach by adding a second figure showing exemplars of one or two phrase "type" from same
year both populations? My conclusion from earlier reviews of this MS is thus pretty much
unchanged: I agree that songs from humpback singers off Gabon and off Madagascar share some
versions of phrases and themes on an annual temporal scale. I agree that this indicates some level
of acoustic contact and interchange most likely during common periods of migration and
foraging. The improvements in this version are that the authors have made a good faith effort to
20
increase the acoustic sample size and the analysis to the extent possible, and tone down their
interpretations of these basic results. Thanks for all the extra efforts.

Appendix A
Review of Carvajal, Rekdahl, Garland, Collins, Razafindrakoto and
Rosenbaum (Royal Society) “Culturally transmitted song exchange
between Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the southeast
Atlantic and southwest Indian ocean basins.” The paper describes an
effort to use shared and divergent humpback whale song
characteristics to infer levels of population mixing between two
breeding grounds on eastern and western coasts of Africa. The authors
do a good job at presenting their work and the results are quite
interesting. The conclusions they reach are reasonably supported by
the data. However, several points need be developed further or
clarified. It is assumed that song similarity is somehow proportional to
the level of population “mixing”, which is not properly defined. The
assumption is not adequately defended and alternative explanations are
not eliminated. As a result, I do not believe the manuscript should be
published in its current form. However, with the appropriate revisions,
I think it would make a good paper.

P.5, 94: Define “BSA-BSG”
P.5, 98-103: This seems out of place and more appropriate for the
methods section
P.5, 112: I think perhaps the word “determine” is reaching too far. I
suggest using “examine” instead.
Methods:
P.6: You need to provide more information about how the data were
collected. Approximately how far away from the boat were the singers
you recorded? How many singers did you record each year at each
location? Was the full song recorded each time or only a part of the
song? Did you record only one cycle of the song from each individual
or multiple cycles? These pieces of information are important to help
determine the quality of your data.
P.6, 125: Provide the make and model of the hydrophones used.
P.7, 160-161: “median” or “medium”?
P.8, 166-167: So, does this mean that you also used incomplete songs
in your analysis? If so, can you be confident that this did not bias your
results?
Results:
P.10, 227: I don’t see how you can say that overall songs were similar.
From what I can tell on Table 2, songs were generally not very similar
across years and the similarity between populations varied from not
very similar at all, to identical. I think it is more accurate to say that
song similarity between populations and across years varied widely
year-to-year.
Discussion:
P.11, 250: Please explain how these annual variations in song
similarity between populations is evidence of cultural transmission.
Are you saying that when songs were not very similar there was little
cultural transmission while when they were identical there was lots of
transmission? From Table 2 it looks like the inter-annual similarity
was low within the two populations, so lots of change is taking place
in the song year to year regardless. How is the changing inter-annual
similarity between populations indicative of cultural transmission?
Could the similarities not be random?
P.11, 253: What is the evidence for “exchange” of song between
populations? Please explain.
P.11, 256: I think before you can assume that population connectivity
is the only way that songs can become more similar, you need to make
a convincing case for why these similarities could not simply arise by
random chance alone.
P. 12, 265: “Acoustic contact” is a pretty vague term. It make is
sound as if song transmission is like a virus that just requires one
whale to sneeze on the other and now the two populations are singing
the same song. I suspect that it’s a bit more complicated than that.
Please be more clear about how you believe song features are
transferred from one population to the other. A discussion of why
song transmission should even take place would also be useful.
P.12, 274: Again, I think you need to make a more convincing
argument that song similarity/dissimilarity is evidence of “song
exchange.” Could this not be a stochastic process in which certain
phrases and/or themes are modified each year and in some years two
populations converge on some phrases/themes while other years they
don’t?
P.13, 292: Why only the feeding grounds (where they generally don’t
sing) or the migration routes? Why could some individuals from one
population not be going over to the other and influencing the song in
that manner? It’s known that song evolves over the course of the
season, so why is an inter-population exchange of individuals not a
viable mechanism for the transmission of song characteristics?
Presumably, this is also how the genetic similarity you reference is
maintained.
P.13, 294: You should include a map of the various “Areas” in the
supplementary materials for those who are not familiar with them.
P.14, 300: What do you mean by “mixing on feeding grounds?” Yes,
if they are using the same feeding grounds they are physically mixing,
but are you talking about genetic mixing? How can that be if they are
feeding rather than breeding there? What is more likely, that some
animals are inter-breeding on the feeding grounds or that some are
bouncing back and forth between breeding grounds? Both breeding
and singing primarily occur on the breeding grounds, so it seems like
all this genetic and/or acoustic exchange is more likely to occur there
than on the feeding grounds. If you don’t know, then you should at
least present both possibilities.
P.14, 306: “Exchanging song” sounds like an active process. Here is
some of my song; I’ll take some of yours. Is that what you’re
proposing? I suspect the process is more likely to be a form of song
copying. Since you don’t know for sure, you should use terms that
acknowledge the uncertainty. I think it makes more sense to say
something like: ‘… whether shared song characteristics are transferred
on migration routes…’

Comments to the Author:
The three referees have all raised substantial issues with this manuscript, and it is a
long way from being publishable in its current form. The authors should be given an
opportunity to consider and revise according to the helpful comments and criticisms
raised (though this will take quite a bit of work). It is an interesting paper, to be sure;
but it needs considerable work before it can be considered publishable.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a polished paper that, with its multiple year comparison, provides new
information on how songs may reflect humpback whale population interactions. In
my view it warrants publication -- however, I do have questions and some issues.
These are:
1. Sample Size
The sample size, i.e. the number of individuals recorded, is small to very small
and this weakens the quantitative analyses presented (which are a large focus of
the paper) – (it weakens the qualitative analyses as well).
<U+F0B7> Thank you for this helpful comment. We did have a limited number of
samples for some years for both populations and unfortunately there are no
more samples available to analyze. However, for those years/populations
where we had multiple singers we found that the song was stable across those
samples (i.e. there were similar themes sung by each individual singer in that
sample), and as such we can be more confident that we have accurately
documented the song type for that population/year. If the song varied
between the individuals in our sample then we would need a larger sample
size to determine the ‘mean’ or typical song type for that population and year
(see Garland et al. 2011, Rekdahl 2012).
In 2002 Gabon a single whale sampled is clearly not enough to declare it
representative of the population. It could be? – or, it might not be?. There are
examples in the literature of individual singers not singing the full repertoire of
the ‘population’s’ song during one song session, and others whose song is quite
aberrant compared to the general population.
I find it somewhat troubling that the 2002 comparison with smallest sample
leads to the least similarity between populations (L 229) . This could easily be
the result of a too small a sample: one whale’s song is just not adequate to make
this conclusion.
Just two individuals sampled in Gabon 2001 and Madagascar 2001 and 2002 is
not much better. The samples in the other years, from 3 or 4 individuals, are
more convincing (but only because of the well documented similarity of most
songs in a population at any one time)
<U+F0B7> These are valid comments however we are unfortunately unable to obtain any
more samples from Gabon for that year. The singer was consistent across the
four song cycles that we had available to analyze and in our experience,
aberrant singers tend to be variable from song cycle to song cycle (Frumhoff
1983). Furthermore, the 2003 Madagascar and Gabon song type, although
more similar, was still largely different and therefore, we feel confident that
the 2002 Gabon and Madagascar song types were also different, which is one
of the interesting discussion points for this paper. We are also suggesting in
the paper that there is considerable similarity (based on visual match it has
similar or the same themes) between the Gabon song type in 2002 and the
song type from the population in Brazil (Darling and Sousa-Lima 2005) is
likely from Brazil and therefore we are making the assumption that this was
the source of the different song type.
I wondered why the 2001-2002 data was even included – when the main point of
the paper can be easily made with the 2003-2005 data, (still with a small, but
defendable sample size).
<U+F0B7> We feel that the 2001 and 2002 song types are still valid inclusions into this
paper, particularly given the similarity between the 2002 Gabon and Brazil
populations (Darling and Sousa-lima 2005). We also again want to highlight
that the stability of the song both in the repetition of the song cycle for the
individual, and between individuals within a population, strongly suggests
that we are characterizing the typical song type for that population even
though there is a small sample size. Please refer to the added paragraph in the
discussion, line 482.
Table 1 requires more information in order to judge the sample used. It should
include date of recording, length of recording, and the number of song cycles
recorded (if the recording of the single whale in 2001 was long and included
many song cycles it may be more representative than just one cycle). The dates
are important with such a small sample size, as without them we cannot tell if
the recordings were made at beginning of season, or end of season, or spread
throughout season – which may be a factor in composition of the songs – and
bias the comparisons.
<U+F0B7> We have added the number of song cycles analyzed as well as the duration of
the audio file, however with the data being more than a decade old, we
unfortunately do not have the date of recordings.
2. Description of Methods
I read through the Methods several times in attempt to follow the process… and
I think some further explanation/clarification could help a lot. I’m a fan of
succinctness but this paper is one of the few I have seen that, in my view at least,
takes this notion too far. Perhaps this is the style of the journal (which I am not
that familiar with) and the reader is expected to get much of the information
from supplementary material or elsewhere, but at very least, enough
information should be included in body of the text so a reader can follow it. In
most cases this can be corrected with the addition of a sentence or two at several
points in the text.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for this useful comment. We revised the methods section so it is
easier to understand and does not rely so heavily on the supplementary text.
We have also included examples in our methods so the reader can more
easily interpret the process.
<U+F0B7> Line 201 onwards: “Once all song cycles for each singer were transcribed, an
assessment of the ‘typical’ song cycle was undertaken for each singer in
order to assign a ‘median’ sequence for further analysis [38]. This was done
at the individual level by qualitatively examining the sequence of units and
phrases in each song cycle, determining the typical phrase/theme type and
then the typical phrases/theme sequence that makes up a typical or ‘median’
song type for each singer. Due to the inherent inter-individual variability in
humpback whale song, a 50% rule was applied to determine the median or
average string per singer [43]. At the unit level, if a unit was sung in 50% or
more of the phrases/themes characterizing a phrase/theme type then it was
included into the median phrase/theme type for that individual (e.g. An
individual may sing phrase/theme 1 as moan, whoop, cry for the first song
cycle but then consistently sings moan, whoop, cry, cry for the rest of the
four song cycles then the median phrase/theme type for that singer would be
moan, whoop, cry, cry). Similarly, if a phrase/theme type was present in at
least 50% of all song cycles analysed, then this was included in the median
string used for the LSI analysis (e.g. If over three song cycles, a singer sung
the phrase/theme sequence 1,2,3,4 but on the fourth song cycle the singer
sung the sequence 1,2,3,4,5 then the median string for this singer would be
1,2,3,4). Condensing the data to a single string per individual singer avoided
biasing the results towards singers for which there were a higher number of
song sequences [43]. Due to data constraints (small sample size) and
recording quality (all units had to be recognizable, good signal to noise ratio,
and at least one complete song cycle for each singer), the number of
individuals recorded in each population per year varied (see Table 1).”
Some examples:
L 140-141: I realize this is a classic definition of the song – but it is not
uncommon for some alternation/repetitiveness of themes in one song cycle e.g.
1234345. Did this not occur in this sample?. If it did then this definition of song
needs a caveat.
<U+F0B7> If song was not sung in order with all themes (ex. 12345), then we did not
use that cycle for analysis.
L 157-161: This needs to be better explained. Once you had the alpha/numeric
transcription of the composition – then you ‘qualitatively’ applied rules for
determination of a median string and the rule was a unit or phrase was included
(in the median string) if present in 50% or more of an individual’s song…
Questions: Are you looking at units or phrases, or both?
<U+F0B7> This was done by qualitatively examining the sequence of units and phrases
in each song cycle, determining the typical phrase/theme type and then the
typical phrases/theme sequence that makes up a typical or ‘median’ song
type for each singer. In other words, we determined the sequence of units that
made up each phrase/sub-phrase in each theme and then determined the
sequence of phrases/themes that made up the typical song cycle. See
supplemental material for median song and phrase strings used in the
analysis.
Does this mean that, for example, a phrase has to be in over 50% of the song
cycle to be included? This seems to be what it says (or does it mean that the
phrase has to be in more than 50% of the song cycles of an individual?).
Certainly some phrases may comprise 50% or more of song but others are
consistently 10 or 20 or 40 %. What happens to them – just not included? This
does not make any sense at all to me. So I am presuming I do not understand
this process of getting a median string --- which would suggest some clarification
is necessary. A few more sentences and perhaps a figure to define the process
would be helpful here.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for this comment and it is important that our methods come across
clearly for readers to understand. In regards to your examples, a phrase needs
to be in more than 50% of the song cycles an individual sings to be included
in the median string (same goes for units that compose each phrase). Here is
an excerpt from the methods sections that was rewritten to clarify such
confusion: “Due to the inherent inter-individual variability in humpback
whale song, a 50% rule was applied to determine the median or average
string per singer [38]. At the unit level, if a unit was sung in 50% or more of
the phrases/themes characterizing a phrase/theme type then it was included
into the median phrase/theme type for that individual (e.g. An individual may
sing phrase/theme 1 as moan, whoop, cry for the first song cycle but then
consistently sings moan, whoop, cry, cry for the rest of the four song cycles
then the median phrase/theme type for that singer would be moan, whoop,
cry, cry). Similarly, if a phrase/theme type was present in at least 50% of all
song cycles analysed, then this was included in the median string used for the
LSI analysis (e.g. If over three song cycles, a singer sung the phrase/theme
sequence 1,2,3,4 but on the fourth song cycle the singer sung the sequence
1,2,3,4,5 then the median string for this singer would be 1,2,3,4).” [line 206]
L173-188: Again – a little clarification would go a long way here. Is this song
comparison based on phrases (as inferred in L 153), or units as is apparent in
this paragraph? Perhaps it is both?
<U+F0B7> Song comparison was made on two levels, song level (which is composed on
themes/phrases) and phrase/sub-phrase level (composed of units). See section
from line 254, and specifically “To ensure the qualitative classification of
themes was consistent, an initial LSI analysis was run to group strings of
units (phrase) into themes. Once themes were verified, song similarity among
the populations and years was investigated. Here, a string represents the
median theme sequence from each individual.”
Or, is this exercise solely for the purpose of testing the qualitative/human
definition of units – in other words its purpose more to promote quantitative
analyses than for the purpose of the song comparisons? As is stated earlier (L
153), some variability in units within a phrase is not uncommon – but the
pattern of units within the phrase is stable. But it seems the pattern is not the
metric analyzed here, but rather the variability in the units? If clarified, this
analysis is okay I guess, it’s interesting.
<U+F0B7> We have clarified the meaning here: “In order to validate the qualitative unit
level classification, and ensure that units classified by a human classifier are
similar across populations and years, twenty unit types were selected based
on the presence of unit types in the song of both populations (in at least one
year or across multiple years).” [Line 225]
L190-206: As this paragraph is the key to the results, I feel this description
overall is too brief to follow for a typical reader. It seems one has to be very
familiar with the Garland papers (including one ‘in review’) to judge this
process. The term ‘terminal node’ requires a little more clarification in the
context of this study - as clearly it is the bottom line of the study.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for this feedback, Garland et al. (In Review) has recently been
published, “Garland EC, Rendell L, Lilley MS, Poole MM, Allen J. 2017.
The devil is in the detail: quantifying vocal variation in a complex, multi-
levelled, and rapidly evolving display. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 142, 460-472
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.4991320)” We have removed the wording
‘terminal node’ and clarified this section “Each major branch of the tree
represents a song type regardless of the population, year or individual the
song came from.” [line 283-284]
L 194: ‘Each individuals median theme sequence’ -- does not the reliability of
this value depend on the number of song cycles that are recorded? Singers can
omit themes in any one song cycle – although rarely do this over multiple cycles.
I think we need to know how many song cycles went into developing an
individuals median theme --- especially because samples sizes for an entire
region for an entire season are just 1 or 2 individuals in some cases!
<U+F0B7> Thanks for your input on this, we have added the number of full song cycles
we analyzed in Table 1. Number of song cycles analyzed was dependent a
number of factors including quality of recording and length of recording.
Even if there were only 2 full song cycles available to include in the analysis,
we still looked at partial song cycles where available to help in assessing the
typical phrase and theme structure for that singer and year.
3. Presentation overall – I appreciate the efforts at quantification of the song
comparison process (although would be much happier with samples sizes were
larger), but I miss the more ‘traditional’ descriptive comparisons used in most
papers on the topic, using charts and graphs that allow immediate visualization
of song similarities and differences. Why not do both?
<U+F0B7> Thank you for this comment and we added a section in the results describing
song types (see line 287). We used the Levenshtein method because it has
been in numerous studies to look at humpback song and added a quantitative
component to our analysis.
Other Comments
Table 2: Were only some of the year to year/same location comparisons made,
or were they all made and most have 0 similarity? (I went through the paper
looking for an explanation of this – but if there I could not find it). If only some
of them were analyzed (those in bold) please explain why not all? And then, if
this is the case and only some to the year to year same location songs compared,
why are the very low similarities say between Gabon 2002 to 2003 or 2003 to
2004 (20%) not discussed in the paper? That is it appears song can be more
similar between oceans in some years than in one location from one year to the
next. Is this correct? This seems to suggest a much more dynamic process than
just the ‘degree of mixing’ between the populations? I think this all warrants
further presentation and discussion in the paper – rather than being ‘buried’ in
the Table?
<U+F0B7> Yes, all comparisons were made and the 0 represents zero similarity between
those songs. Table 2 does demonstrate that song can be more similar between
these two population in one year than a single populations song in
consecutive years. Humpback songs are known to undergo continual
evolution within a season and as such, songs can be almost entirely different
from year to year within the same population. This has been well
documented in the literature and is ever present in the Southern Hemisphere
populations discussed in this paper (see Garland et al..papers)
Line 80: Not sure we have any idea how songs are learned. This sentence may
need a little more finesse.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for this comment; we added a sentence to address this,
“Presumably, male humpback whales need to be in acoustic contact for song
learning to occur, although little is known about the factors driving the
transmission of song between individuals and populations” [Line 91].
Line 150: Is this line intended to say: “If a theme consisted of two or more
phrases…” or is it a typo? If intended I think more explanation is needed: Is
not the definition of a theme the same phrase repeated? Do some of the songs
analyzed have more than one type of phrase composition in them? Or, do you
mean to say that - a theme consisted of multiple repetitions of one phrase? I’m
not sure it matters which one it is but an explanation of a phrase, how one is
defined from another, and how many are in one theme is necessary here.
<U+F0B7> We changed that sentence to clarify further “If a theme consisted of two or
more sub-phrases.” (Line 193). A theme may only have one phrase that is
repeated over and over to construct that theme or a theme may be composed
of multiple sub-phrases that repeats to make a theme (e.g. if theme 1 has 3
sub-phrases, the theme would be sung in this order: 1a, 1b, 1c, 1a, 1b, 1c, 1a,
1b, 1c, etc.)
Line 227: it says here, “ Overall, songs were similar within and between
populations… Am I misreading, or misunderstanding something here. It
appears to me that the data in Table 2 says there is a huge range in degree of
similarity year to year within and between.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for bringing this observation to our attention, and we have
reworded the sentence to say “Overall, song similarity varied.” [Line 376]
L241-243: I do not understand the statement here. The ‘lowest similarity’
discussed here is likely DUE to the limited sample size, not ‘despite the limited
sample size’ as stated. This is followed by a speculative sentence that I’d suggest
deleting entirely, but if not – is it not true that with a larger sample size it’s
more likely a better representative of the song would be obtained, which then
may, or may not, be grouped into one vocal population?
<U+F0B7> Thank you for the comment. We would like to stress again that even though
there was a small sample size, the singer was consistent across the four song
cycles that we had available to analyze and in our experience and aberrant
singers tend to be variable from song cycle to song cycle (Frumhoff 1983).
Furthermore, the 2003 Madagascar and Gabon song type, although more
similar, was still largely different and therefore, we feel confident that the
2002 Gabon and Madagascar song types were also different, which is one of
the interesting discussion points for this paper. We are also suggesting in the
paper that there is considerable similarity (based on visual match it has
similar or the same themes) between the Gabon song type in 2002 and the
song type from the population in Brazil (Darling and Sousa-Lima 2005) is
likely from Brazil and therefore we are making the assumption that this was
the source of the different song type.
Line 263: I believe this is the first mention of the number of shared phrases
between the populations. I think this is interesting/important but this data
should be presented in the Results (that is, the number of shared phrases year to
year and place to place) not just appear in the Discussion Or perhaps this is in
another paper and a reference in missing.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for your input. We have added a section in the results that
discusses song types that talks about shared themes and how they varied year
to year and between populations.
<U+F0B7> Line 287-259, “A total of 31 themes were identified across all populations
and years (Table 3), however some themes consisted of two or three sub-
phrases. Table 3 shows the average unit composition for each phrase/theme
in each population. In 2001, Gabon and Madagascar had similar song types,
with shared phrases/themes. This song type had 5 themes, with theme two
split into two sub-phrases. One notable difference, was that Gabon sang a
descending cry-woop as one unit, while Madagascar broke the unit into two
singing a descending cry and then a woop, notably in phrase 1 (see table 3).
Although Gabon and Madagascar had the same phrase 1 structure, Gabon
sung a yap train while Madagascar sung a snort train after a single grunt, at
the start of theme 1. In 2002, Gabon and Madagascar had different song
types. Gabon’s song type had 6 themes, including a shifting theme and
multiple sub phrases for theme 7 and 8. Both populations sung theme 14,
however Gabon sung a squeal-moan, while Madagascar sung a descending
cry. Madagascar’s song type consisted of sub phrase 7c (ascending moan or
moan x2, squeal) and four themes, theme 12 being made-up of two sub
phrases. Gabon’s 2003 song type, was elaborate in that it consisted of one
shifting themes (7s), nine standard themes, and sub phrase 7b that was sung
the previous year by this population. Madagascar also sung themes 7s, 11,
15, and 17, with one individual omitting theme 14 and replacing it with
theme 6, while Gabon sung theme 14 and 6 consecutively. The following
year theme 14 is not sung in either populations, while theme 6 is present in
both populations 2004 song. In 2004, both populations continued to sing 7s,
with one individual from Gabon singing sub phrase 7b from the previous
year in addition to the shifting theme. Gabon’s 2004 song type consisted of
an evolution of theme 18 (18E) neither of which were seen in any of
Madagascar’s songs. In addition to theme 7s, themes 23, 24, and 25 were
shared among both populations in 2004. While Gabon’s theme 24 only
consisted of sub phrase 24a, Madagascar’s theme 24 consisted of three sub
phrases (24a, 24b, 24c). Theme 23 usually consisted of a moan, moan,
descending cry, modulated moan, and a squeak train, but it is interesting to
note that Madagascar’s squeak trains was consistently longer than Gabon’s
squeak trains. In 2005, one individual from Gabon (ind.1) and one individual
(ind.18) from Madagascar, sung an evolution of theme 23 (23E). Individual
one from Gabon sung themes from the previous year, replacing theme 23
with 23E and adding sub-phrase 24b, while individual 18 from Madagascar
sung the new 2005 song with the addition of 23E. In 2005, both populations
sung theme 24 with all three sub-phrases (24a, 24b, 24c). Gabon only sung
phrase 27b, while individuals from Madagascar sung sub phrases 27a and
27b. In general, individuals in both populations sang similar themes in the
same order, with the exception of the two individuals mentioned above.”
Figure 3: Several questions: why are just these two years given – presumably
as examples for some reason? What do the numbers/letters mean on each
phrase? Why are they not in order? Is that the full recording of the only sample
in Gabon 2002? The caption needs FAR more explanation of the purpose of the
figure and the meaning of the labels.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for your comment. We wanted to demonstrates that Gabon and
Madagascar’s 2003 songs were more similar to each other than to each
respective populations’ song the previous year and that Gabon may have had
an influence on Madagascar’s 2003 song.
<U+F0B7> We have rewritten the caption to provide additional information, “Figure 3.
Spectrograms demonstrating phrase composition and progression of song
similarity for Gabon and Madagascar songs in 2002 and 2003. In 2002, song
similarity between populations was 11% and then increased to 27% in 2003.
Similarity between Madagascar’s 2002 and 2003 song is 14%, while Gabon
shared 18% similarity between their 2002 and 2003 song (see table 2). This
demonstrates that Gabon and Madagascar’s 2003 songs were more similar to
each other than to each respective populations’ song the previous year
(2002). In 2002, both populations share theme/phrase 14 and 7c. In 2003,
both populations share theme 14, however unit types are more similar to
theme 14 from the Gabon 2002 song rather than Madagascar’s 2002 song.
Both populations also share themes 7s (shifting theme), 15, and 17 in 2003,
which are not sung by either population in 2002. Only one theme (11) that
was solely sung by the Madagascar’s population in 2002, is seen in both
populations song in 2003.”

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper has many problems. The sample size is extremely and insufficiently
small such that this paper's results are highly qualified. The text significantly
understates the extremely high variability in humpback song, and the sample
size does nothing but undermine the papers overstated conclusions. As stated in
the abstract "However, these results provide a more detailed understanding of
song exchange between these two populations..." To claim detailed
understanding of humpback song based on 477 calls from 30 singers over five
years is a very serious under representation of song variability in an animal
whose males are well known for their extremely high singing virtuosity. This is a
reflection of the paper's fundamental weakness.
<U+F0B7> We did have a limited number of samples for some years for both
populations and unfortunately there are no more samples available to
analyze. However, for those years/populations where we had multiple singers
we found that the song was stable across those samples (i.e. there were
similar themes sung by each individual singer in that sample), and as such we
can be more confident that we have accurately documented the song type for
that population/year. If the song varied between the individuals in our sample
then we would need a larger sample size to determine the ‘mean’ or typical
song type for that population and year (see Garland et al. 2011, Rekdahl
2012).
<U+F0B7> We have addressed humpback song variability on lines 93 onwards, “There
can be considerable intra- and inter-individual variability in how songs are
sung within populations, which may be due to behavioural or physiological
mechanisms that are not currently well understood. Nonetheless, the degree
of individual variability displayed does not negate the population wide
conformity by males to a particular song type at any one point in time, and
intra-population variability is generally less than inter-population variability
in the song [15]. As such, at any point in time, song can be used to
acoustically identify distinct populations based on differences in the
composition of their songs [15].”
Might I suggest that the authors consider redoing this paper so as to include a
comparative song note analysis that is both quantitative (not subjective as this
is) and uses as its reference, songs from humpbacks recorded in a place and in
years very distant from these two regions and periods of time. This might
provide an actual reference frame by which to assess the results from
comparative analysis of these two, very small samples. No one doubts that
humpback males can and in some cases do share songs across populations. What
this paper seems to be trying to advertise is that this situation off Africa is either
unique or deserves greater attention, but this is not a unique situation, is it?
Isn't it really a reflection of where the research was/is conducted, and not a
fundamental scientific question germane to singers off Africa?
<U+F0B7> In relation to use of quantitative measures to compare songs. We would like
to reiterate that we have included a quantitative component to both the
validation of unit types used to describe the song phrases and themes using a
CART analysis, and to the analysis of song similarity using the levenshtein
index. Additionally, the comparison of song between neighbouring
populations, in different ocean basins, hasn’t been studied as extensively as
song between populations in the same ocean basin. Additionally, as stated in
the paper, “song similarity between distinct breeding populations has
generally been reported for populations inhabiting the same ocean basin,
as presumably there more opportunities for acoustic overlap of populations
(i.e. see 23, 28, 29, 43, 52). The level of song sharing between the
Madagascar and Gabon populations located in different ocean basins, and
within the same year, is so far unreported for any other humpback whale
population. The findings from this study contribute valuable information
towards understanding the dynamic nature of song exchange between
different humpbacks whale breeding populations, and how patterns of song
exchange may be used in conjunction with more traditional methods for
understanding population structure and connectivity of humpback whales on
contemporary time scales [15].” (Line 413). We therefore think that this
study does provide valuable information to the knowledge of song change
and exchange between humpback whale populations.
Additional Comments from the manuscript by Reviewer 2
<U+F0B7> Please note that we have addressed all comments relating to punctuation and
grammar.
Line 27. This does not adequately define or circumscribe the various
mechanisms by which song exposure and learning can occur.
<U+F0B7> As this is in the abstract, we do not have the room to fully explain these
mechanisms, however we do discuss them in the introduction, “Garland et al.
(2017) demonstrated that song may be learned in segments via ‘horizontal
cultural transmission’ which is the exchange of continually evolving song
within a generation [22a, 22b]. Presumably, male humpback whales need to
be in acoustic contact for song learning to occur, although little is known
about the factors driving the transmission of song between individuals and
populations. There can be considerable intra- and inter-individual variability
in how songs are sung within populations, which may be due to behavioural
or physiological mechanisms that are not currently well understood.” (Line
89)
Line 34. Suggest rewriting these last sentences, which are primarily self-serving
and not particularly novel. It is well known that male humpbacks are open
learners and exchange song components on a nearly continuous basis, and will
do so across broad ocean areas. Science already has demonstrated a genetic
basis associating songs and population structure. This should end with the
import of the discoveries provided in this MA, not with a request for more
research and it's implied funding.
<U+F0B7> Thank you, we have addressed this in the abstract, mentioning that our
results show fine-scale patterns of song exchange between populations in
different ocean basins that suggest varying levels of population interchange
year to year. “However, the results presented here also show fine-scale
patterns to song exchange between populations in different ocean basins that
suggest varying levels of population interchange year to year.” [Line 35]
Line 56. Clarify what you mean here. Is it higher resolution, higher temporal
scales or both?
<U+F0B7> We have clarified this sentence “Utilising additional methods that can
contribute behavioral and/or environmental information at a higher resolution
can prove beneficial for informing conservation and management decisions
[11].” [Line 57]
Line 57. There's that "may" again, which based on formal rules of grammar is
used to denote permission, whereas "can" denotes the ability to do something. I
presume that the Royal Society editors know this distinction? In any case, given
the relatively minor, but generous number of grammatical errors in these last
eight lines, I will stop making comments on such things. That said, I had
assumed that any MS submitted to the RS for consideration would have been
properly edited.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for this comment, we have addressed grammar and punctuation
issue in the revised manuscript.
Line 62. Since males do not have to be in physical or even visual contact to
exchange bioacoustic objects, it would be good to define what is meant by
"mixing."
<U+F0B7> We have clarified and altered this sentence to “In the Southern Hemisphere,
migratory routes are complex and discrete populations may have
opportunities for acoustic contact and population mixing at certain points
during migration or on feeding grounds.”[Line 67]
Line 68. What types of data? The previous sentences do not identify data, just
two techniques by which to obtain data.
Line 69. What mechanisms?
Line 70. Longer than which scales?
<U+F0B7> In response to the above comments, we have revised this sentence for clarity.
The updated sentence reads, “Also, these methods have limitations for
understanding contemporary movement patterns, as genetic data typically
operates over longer temporal scales and are generally costly to collect.”
(Line 74)
Line 72. Why and how is song a "sensitive" indicator?
<U+F0B7> Song can be a sensitive indicator because it changes yearly, which is rather
rapidly compared to other tools such as genetics. Line 79, “This can be done
through the analysis of change in the male breeding display (‘song’), as it
provides a sensitive indicator of population connectivity due to consistent
annual changes in song composition [15].”
Line 74. This modifies "South Pacific Ocean populations", but I doubt that
authors meant to say that South Pacific Ocean populations "supported and
refined...".
<U+F0B7> The authors are stating that looking at song data supported and refined the
current understanding of population structure. “Recently, song has been used
to investigate connectivity between western and central South Pacific Ocean
populations [15], which supported and refined the current understanding of
population structure inferred from genetics and photo ID data.” (Line 104)
Line 78. I would suggest that this oversimplification of reality be qualified by
something reasonable such as: "It is generally agreed that humpback songs ..."
This is because subjective statements such as these, which are distillations of
many studies, are not specifically true. Humpbacks, even individuals, do not
sing the same song twice. They are constantly modifying the actual numbers of
notes and phrases in songs such that song length is highly variable. So it is
critically important from the start to recognize that on some scales of analyses
there is a very high level of variation in humpback song. To simplify to the
extent written here is both inaccurate and imprecise, analytically and
biologically. The cited references do not contradict these words, nor do they
enlighten the words in the MS.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for your input and we have edited this sentence appropriately
based on your suggestion, “It is generally agreed that songs continually
evolve within and between years [17-19], however, all males within a
population typically maintain the same song at any point in time [16, 18, 20,
21].” [Line 86]
Line 106. This is a trite, redundant statement. More research is always needed
or required. Please, rethink and then restate what it is this sentence is intended
to communicate, or better yet, delete and rely on the final paragraph of this
section to underscore the import of this paper.
<U+F0B7> We have removed that statement from the paper.
Line 109. Actually, you do not investigate cultural transmission. Isn't it more
that you investigated the degree to which singing males in two different
populations share song features while singing in breeding areas, which are in
two different oceans? You then assume that that your results represent a form
of cultural transmission between these two different populations.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for your input we have addressed this and edited the paragraph as
follows, “Here, we investigated the degree of song similarity between Gabon
and Madagascar populations across five concurrent years (2001-2005) in
order to understand 1) whether song sharing occurs between the Gabon and
Madagascar populations that are known to have a relatively high level of
genetic mixing and 2) whether the degree to which song sharing occurs
varies over time and thus can provide the fine-scale understanding of
population connectivity patterns seen in other Southern Hemisphere
populations. This is the first study to our knowledge that uses multiple
concurrent years of song data from these two populations to investigate
population connectivity on contemporary time scales.” [Line 139]
Line 110. This term is entirely subjective and is unnecessary. I think it's
critically important for the authors not to embellish the text at this point with
such adjectives. Leave such embellishments to the discussion after the reader
has had a chance to comprehend the fundamentals and essence of the paper.
<U+F0B7> We have removed the term “fine scale movement” that the reviewer was
referring to. The line now reads “and 3) whether the song similarity can
provide an understanding of the population connectivity patterns that are
observed in other Southern Hemisphere populations” [line 142]
Line 111. Again, this seems self-congratulatory and unnecessary, especially
given that no other group is devoted to studying these two humpback
populations. Instead, tell the reader the implications and importance of the
research results - something about the degree of connectivity between the
populations and the insights gained by using song sharing metrics as the means
by which to quantify population interchange (at least in males). i.e. rephrasing
the last sentence in the former paragraph, which the self-congratulatory words.
<U+F0B7> We took this sentence out and replaced it with, “This is the first study to our
knowledge that uses multiple concurrent years of song data from these two
populations to investigate population connectivity on contemporary time
scales.” (Line 144)
Line 125. Off Madagascar?
<U+F0B7> Line 155, we rewrote the sentence as “Songs were recorded in Antongil Bay
(16°00’S, 49°55’E), Madagascar and at two sites in Gabon: Iguela (1°51’S,
9°20’E) and Mayumba (3°26'S, 10°39'E).”
Line 127. I presume the hydrophone was connected to a DAT recorder, not a
DAT.
<U+F0B7> We have fixed this to “DAT recorder”.
The response at 20Hz ?? yes, you'll record some energy down there but you have
little to no idea what you're missing?
<U+F0B7> Thank you for this comment and we have referenced a paper that states the
typical frequency range of humpback whale song is usually between 100 Hz
and 4 kHz and our recording equipment recorded from 50-17,000 Hz. (38.
Tyack PL, Clark CW. 2000. Communication and Acoustic Behaviour of
Dolphins and Whales. Springer-Verlag, New York. pp. 156–224.)

Reviewer: 3
The paper describes an effort to use shared and divergent humpback whale song
characteristics to
infer levels of population mixing between two breeding grounds on eastern and
western coasts of Africa. The authors do a good job at presenting their work and the
results are quite interesting. The conclusions they reach are reasonably supported by
the data. However, several points need be developed further or clarified. It is
assumed that song similarity is somehow proportional to the level of population
“mixing”, which is not properly defined. The assumption is not adequately defended
and alternative explanations are not eliminated. As a result, I do not believe the
manuscript should be published in its current form. However, with the appropriate
revisions, I think it would make a good paper.
Specific Comments
Introduction:
P.3, 64-66: There should be some citations to go along with this statement.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for this comment, we had added citations for this statement
(Rosenbaum et al. 2009, Kershaw et al. 2017, Rosenbaum et al. 2017).
“Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (e.g., microsatellites)
studies have investigated gene flow [12-14], while photo ID studies utilizing
mark-recapture techniques have been used to assess population interchange.”
[Line 71]
P.3, 69: What do you mean by “these mechanisms”? Also, photo ID can give you
information about animal movements on “contemporary” time scales, but yes, it
is labor
intensive.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for this comment, we have restructured this sentence not include
the word “mechanisms”. “Also, these methods have limitations for
understanding contemporary movement patterns, as genetic data typically
operates over longer temporal scales and are generally costly to collect.”
[Line 74]
P.5, 94: Define “BSA-BSG”
<U+F0B7> We have edited the manuscript to better explain the IWC breeding stocks and
have also included a map in the supplemental materials to show where each
breeding stock is located and their associated feeding areas.
P.5, 98-103: This seems out of place and more appropriate for the methods
section
<U+F0B7> We feel that this is better placed here as it outlines the populations discussed
in the rest of the paper and how the populations will be discussed.
P.5, 112: I think perhaps the word “determine” is reaching too far. I suggest
using
“examine” instead.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for this comment, however we decided to take out this sentence
from the manuscript.
Methods:
P.6: You need to provide more information about how the data were collected.
Approximately how far away from the boat were the singers you recorded? How
many singers did you record each year at each location? Was the full song
recorded each time or only a part of the song? Did you record only one cycle of
the song from each individual or multiple cycles? These pieces of information
are important to help determine the quality of your data.
<U+F0B7> Recordings had more than one song cycle and we have added the number of
singers and # of cycles analyzed to Table 1. As we are using data collected
over 15 years ago we do not have the detailed recording location and have
provided the information that we have.
P.6, 125: Provide the make and model of the hydrophones used.
<U+F0B7> Unfortunately we do not have access to this information. As we are using
data collected over 15 years ago we do not have the detailed recording details
and have provided the information that we have.
P.7, 160-161: “median” or “medium”?
<U+F0B7> This is the median or average string.
P.8, 166-167: So, does this mean that you also used incomplete songs in your
analysis?
If so, can you be confident that this did not bias your results?
<U+F0B7> We did not use incomplete song cycles, we only analyzed full songs. This
sentence is an explanation of why we only analyzed a limited number of
cycles per singer.
Results:
P.10, 227: I don’t see how you can say that overall songs were similar. From
what I can
tell on Table 2, songs were generally not very similar across years and the
similarity
between populations varied from not very similar at all, to identical. I think it is
more
accurate to say that song similarity between populations and across years varied
widely
year-to-year.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for this helpful comment, another reviewer brought this up and
we have changed the wording.
Discussion:
P.11, 250: Please explain how these annual variations in song similarity between
populations is evidence of cultural transmission. Are you saying that when songs
were
not very similar there was little cultural transmission while when they were
identical
there was lots of transmission? From Table 2 it looks like the inter-annual
similarity was
low within the two populations, so lots of change is taking place in the song year
to year
regardless. How is the changing inter-annual similarity between populations
indicative of
cultural transmission? Could the similarities not be random?
<U+F0B7> We are suggesting that song similarity may be a direct indication of the
amount of acoustic overlap between the two populations. This has been
shown to be likely between other Southern Hemisphere populations (Garland
et al. 2011, 2015; Rekdahl 2012), as well as in Northern Hemisphere
populations. It’s true that there is often rapid evolution in the song type sung
by a population within a year, and presumably there is little chance for
acoustic overlap and therefore cultural transmission between populations
within a breeding season. That is why we have suggested that any song
transmission is likely occurring on migration or on overlapping feeding
grounds. It is possible that the similarities could be random, however there is
no evidence so far to suggest that the same song type in separate populations
would evolve in the same way. Rekdahl 2012 found that the same song type
(from a song revolution or complete song change) in the west Australian and
east Australian populations did diverge between song revolution years (Every
3-4 years), until the songs were completely different. We have tried to clarify
and add more information regarding humpback song and how song exchange
may be useful for looking at population connectivity throughout the paper.
P.11, 253: What is the evidence for “exchange” of song between populations?
Please explain.
<U+F0B7> The word exchange is used as songs are presumably culturally learned from
males in acoustic contact and therefore song is passed or exchanged between
males. The evidence for song exchange is the amount of similarity in the
composition and position of the phrases and themes that make up the song.
P.11, 256: I think before you can assume that population connectivity is the only
way that
songs can become more similar; you need to make a convincing case for why
these
similarities could not simply arise by random chance alone.
<U+F0B7> There is always the possibility of similarity being random chance, but with
this much similarity it is highly unlikely.
P. 12, 265: “Acoustic contact” is a pretty vague term. It make is sound as if song
transmission is like a virus that just requires one whale to sneeze on the other
and now
the two populations are singing the same song. I suspect that it’s a bit more
complicated
than that. Please be more clear about how you believe song features are
transferred from
one population to the other. A discussion of why song transmission should even
take
place would also be useful.
<U+F0B7> We understand the reviewer’s frustration regarding the amount of uncertainty
involved in understanding the mechanisms for which songs are transmitted.
We have added recently published information by Garland et al. 2017, which
suggests male humpback whales learn song in “segments”.
P.12, 274: Again, I think you need to make a more convincing argument that
song
similarity/dissimilarity is evidence of “song exchange.” Could this not be a
stochastic
process in which certain phrases and/or themes are modified each year and in
some years
two populations converge on some phrases/themes while other years they don’t?
<U+F0B7> Here we draw on multiple lines of evidence that support the use of song as an
additional method for looking at population connectivity. Genetic and photo
identification studies in the discussed Southern Hemisphere populations
support the acoustically derived population structure (see Garland et al. 2015
for further discussion on this). In this paper, the additional sections and
points of clarification to the manuscript should address these reviewers
concerns.
P.13, 292: Why only the feeding grounds (where they generally don’t sing) or the
migration routes? Why could some individuals from one population not be
going over to
the other and influencing the song in that manner? It’s known that song evolves
over the
course of the season, so why is an inter-population exchange of individuals not a
viable
mechanism for the transmission of song characteristics?
<U+F0B7> There has been singing documented to occur on feeding grounds, and
particularly when preparing to migrate to breeding grounds. It is entirely
possible that individuals are moving between populations, we are just
suggesting that this is very unlikely to occur during the breeding season. We
have added additional information to clarify ‘Individual movement within a
breeding season is more likely to occur between the sub-populations BSB2
and BSC1 due to the relatively close proximity of the breeding grounds
(Figure 1). However, our study sites correspond with BSB2 and BSC3 sub-
stocks (Figure 1), which are thought to breed at lower latitudes. Given the
African continent presents a geographic barrier between the breeding
grounds, it is unlikely that an individual would be able to visit both sites
within a breeding season. Any population mixing and opportunity for song
exchange between these sub-stocks presumably occurs either on their shared
high latitude feeding grounds or on shared migration routes [26, 36].” (see
line 130)
P.13, 294: You should include a map of the various “Areas” in the
supplementary
materials for those who are not familiar with them.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for this suggestion, we have added a map to the supplemental
materials that shows the feeding areas in relation to the breeding stocks.
P.14, 300: What do you mean by “mixing on feeding grounds?” Yes, if they are
using
the same feeding grounds they are physically mixing, but are you talking about
genetic
mixing? How can that be if they are feeding rather than breeding there? What is
more
likely, that some animals are inter-breeding on the feeding grounds or that some
are
bouncing back and forth between breeding grounds? Both breeding and singing
primarily occur on the breeding grounds, so it seems like all this genetic and/or
acoustic
exchange is more likely to occur there than on the feeding grounds. If you don’t
know,
then you should at least present both possibilities.
<U+F0B7> We are referring to physically mixing, they unlikely to be mating (mixing
genetically) on feeding grounds. It was thought breeding stocks traveled
directly south, which would isolate breeding stocks on the Antarctica feeding
grounds as well. However, a recent genetics study (Amaral et al 2016) has
shown multiple breeding stocks occupying the same feeding ground,
showing breeding stocks are not isolated on feeding grounds and thus have
an opportunity for song exchange.
P.14, 306: “Exchanging song” sounds like an active process. Here is some of my
song;
I’ll take some of yours. Is that what you’re proposing? I suspect the process is
more
likely to be a form of song copying. Since you don’t know for sure, you should
use terms
that acknowledge the uncertainty. I think it makes more sense to say something
like: ‘…
whether shared song characteristics are transferred on migration routes…’
<U+F0B7> Thank you for this comment, and we use this term as it is a term already
published and used in this context discussing song similarity between
populations (see Garland et al. 2011; 2017). We acknowledge the uncertainty
of the process of song exchange on lines 88 onwards, “Garland et al. (2017)
demonstrated that song may be learned in segments via ‘horizontal cultural
transmission’ which is the exchange of continually evolving song within a
generation [22a, 22b]. Presumably, male humpback whales need to be in
acoustic contact for song learning to occur, although little is known about the
factors driving the transmission of song between individuals and
populations.”
<U+F0B7> We also address the uncertainty of where song is being exchanged on line
476: “It remains unclear however whether males are exchanging song on
shared migration routes, shared feeding grounds, or by individuals moving
between populations.”

8 49 number of factors may influence population structure in migratory marine species, including
9
10 50 ecological, environmental, genetic and behavioural processes, which may operate over historical
11
12
13
51 or contemporary time scales [7]. On contemporary time scales, for example, individual
14
15 52 movement patterns and population connectivity can change rapidly in response to changing
16
17 53 oceanographic conditions or foraging opportunities, which can become more pronounced under a
18
19
54 changing climate regime [8, 9]. While the fields of genetics and more recently genomics [10],
20
21
22 55 have proved invaluable for understanding population structure and connectivity of marine
23
24 56 mammals over historical time scales, limitations exist for interpreting contemporary movement
25
26 57 and connectivity patterns using these methods. Utilising additional methods that can contribute
27
28
29 58 behavioral and/or environmental information at a higher resolution can prove beneficial for
30
31 59 informing conservation and management decisions [11].
32
33 60
34
35 61 Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are one of the most well studied migratory marine
36
37 62 mammal species. In the Southern Hemisphere, migratory routes are complex and discrete
38
39
40
63 populations may have opportunities for acoustic contact and population mixing at certain points
41
42 64 during migration or on feeding grounds. Humpback whale population structure and connectivity
43
44 65 has typically been investigated using genetic and photo-identification (photo ID) studies.
45
46
66 Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (e.g., microsatellites) studies have investigated
47
48
49 67 gene flow [12-14], while photo ID studies utilising mark-recapture techniques have been used to
50
51 68 assess population interchange. However, genetic and photo ID studies generally require a high
52
53 69 level of effort to collect a relatively small sample size. Also, these methods have limitations for
54
55
56 70 understanding contemporary movement patterns, as genetic data typically operates over longer

2
3 71 temporal scales and are generally costly to collect. Acoustic data for this species can provide
4
5
6 72 another complementary and cost-effective means for assessing population structure. This can be
7
8 73 done through the analysis of change in the male breeding display (‘song’), as it provides a
9
10 74 sensitive indicator of population connectivity due to consistent annual changes in song
11
12
13
75 composition [15].
14
15 76
16
17 77 Humpback whale songs are complex and composed of sequenced vocalisations sung in a specific
18
19
78 pattern [16]. It is generally agreed that songs continually evolve within and between years [17-
20
21
22 79 19], however, all males within a population typically maintain the same song at any point in time
23
24 80 [16, 18, 20, 21]. Garland et al. (2017) demonstrated that song may be learned in segments via
25
26 81 ‘horizontal cultural transmission’ which is the exchange of continually evolving song within a
27
28
29 82 generation [22a, 22b]. Presumably, male humpback whales need to be in acoustic contact for
30
31 83 song learning to occur, although little is known about the factors driving the transmission of song
32
33 84 between individuals and populations. There can be considerable intra- and inter-individual
34
35
36
85 variability in how songs are sung within populations, which may be due to behavioural or
37
38 86 physiological mechanisms that are not currently well understood. Nonetheless, the degree of
39
40 87 individual variability displayed does not negate the population-wide conformity by males to a
41
42
88 particular song type at any one point in time, and intra-population variability is generally less
43
44
45 89 than inter-population variability in the song [15]. As such, at any point in time, song can be used
46
47 90 to acoustically identify distinct populations based on differences in the composition of their
48
49 91 songs [15]. Song exchange between distinct populations does occur and the amount of song
50
51
52 92 similarity between populations appears to be dependent on proximity, with populations within
53
54 93 the same ocean basin tending to sing more similar songs than between ocean basins due to more

3 94 opportunity for acoustic contact [23-29]. Recently, song has been used to investigate
4
5
6 95 connectivity between western and central South Pacific Ocean populations [15], which supported
7
8 96 and refined the current understanding of population structure inferred from genetics and photo
9
10 97 ID data.
11

98
14
15 99 In the Southern Hemisphere, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) currently recognises
16
17 100 seven distinct breeding stocks of humpback whales (BSA-BSG). Although breeding stocks are
18
19
101 considered to be genetically distinct, they have varying degrees of population structure and are
20
21
22 102 thus sometimes divided into sub-stocks [12-14]. The IWC has divided the west African
23
24 103 population (BSB), in the southeast Atlantic, into two sub-stocks (1 and 2) [12, 13, 30] and the
25
26 104 east African population (BSC), in the southwest Indian Ocean, into four sub-stocks (1,2, 3 and 4)
27
28
29 105 [12, 13, 31, 32] (see Figure 1). It is likely that the individuals sampled and discussed in this paper
30
31 106 are representatives from the sub-stocks BSB1 and BSC3 due to the data collection locations of
32
33 107 Gabon and Madagascar, respectively. As there is still a degree of uncertainty however regarding
34
35
36
108 the geographic boundaries and degree of interchange between the African sub-populations [13],
37
38 109 the population level demarcation will be used here (BSB and BSC) and discussed according to
39
40 110 the location at which acoustic data was recorded (Gabon and Madagascar respectively; see
41

52 115 years [33], and between west and east African populations within a single year (2003),

3 117 interchange has been documented previously between Gabon and Madagascar populations based
4
5
6 118 on genetic studies [12-14], and direct movement based on genotypic capture-recapture of an
7
8 119 individual whale [35]. Individual movement within a breeding season is more likely to occur
9
10 120 between the sub-populations BSB2 and BSC1 due to the relatively close proximity of the
11
12
13
121 breeding grounds (Figure 1). However, our study sites correspond with BSB2 and BSC3 sub-
14
15 122 stocks (Figure 1), which are thought to breed at lower latitudes. Given the African continent
16
17 123 presents a geographic barrier between the breeding grounds, it is unlikely that an individual
18
19
124 would be able to visit both sites within a breeding season. Any population mixing and
20
21
22 125 opportunity for song exchange between these sub-stocks presumably occurs either on their
23
24 126 shared high latitude feeding grounds or on shared migration routes [26, 36].
25
26 127
27
28
29 128 Here, we investigated the degree of song similarity between Gabon and Madagascar populations
30
31 129 across five concurrent years (2001-2005) in order to understand: 1) whether song sharing occurs
32
33 130 between the Gabon and Madagascar populations that are known to have a relatively high level of
34
35
36
131 genetic mixing, 2) whether the degree to which song sharing occurs varies over time, and 3)
37
38 132 whether the song similarity can provide an understanding of the population connectivity patterns
39
40 133 that are observed in other Southern Hemisphere populations. This is the first study to our
41
42
134 knowledge that uses multiple concurrent years of song data from these two populations to
43
44
45 135 investigate population connectivity on contemporary time scales.

4
5
6 140 Gabon: Iguela (1°51’S, 9°20’E) and Mayumba (3°26'S, 10°39'E). Antongil Bay is a large
7
8 141 shallow bay in northeastern Madagascar that covers an area of 2800 km2 and has a mean depth of
9
10 142 41.4 m [37]. Iguela and Mayumba are located on the central and southern coast of Gabon,
11
12
13
143 respectively, covering approximately 1750 km2 with depths never exceeding 100 m [34].
14
15 144
16
17 145 Humpback whale songs were recorded off Madagascar using a hand-held hydrophone suspended
18
19
146 from a seven-meter fiberglass boat. The songs recorded from Gabon were obtained using a hand-
20
21
22 147 held hydrophone suspended from a nine-meter rigid hull inflatable boat. In both locations,
23
24 148 hydrophones were attached to preamplifiers and connected to a Sony TCD-D100 digital
25
26 149 audiotape (DAT) recorder. Songs were recorded at 44.1 kHz sampling rate and 16 bits [28]. The
27
28
29 150 system response was flat (+/- 3dB) from 50-17,000 Hz and the overall response was as low as 20
30
31 151 Hz which adequately accounts for the full range of sounds produced in humpback whale song
32
33 152 [38]. From 2001-2004, DAT recordings were converted to digital wav files using Avisoft-

43
44
45
157 Humpback whale songs are highly stereotyped [16] and are arranged in a nested hierarchy (unit,
46
47 158 sub-phrase, phrase, theme) [16, 18, 39, 40]. A unit is the most fundamental level representing an
48
49 159 individual sound. Units occur in stereotyped sequences called phrases, which can be composed
50
51
160 of sub-phrases of one or more similar or different units which are often repeated in a sequence
52
53
54 161 [21, 40]. Phrases are then repeated any number of times to create themes, and themes are sung in
55
56 162 a particular order to compose the song [16, 18, 20, 21, 40]. A song was defined as any complete

7
8 165 Songs were viewed as spectrograms in Raven 1.4 [41]. Songs were transcribed manually based
9
10 166 on the visual and acoustic qualities of the sound by a human classifier (G.A.C), using Raven Pro
11
12
13
167 1.4 (Hamming, 75% overlap, FFT size 1024 samples), and then reviewed by a second classifier
14
15 168 (M.L.R). Each unit (an individual sound separated from other units by a silent period) was given
16
17 169 a descriptive name (i.e., moan, croak, cry) based on previous descriptions from humpback whale
18
19
170 song studies [16, 18, 19, 21, 26, 28]. Sequences of units were grouped into sub-phrases and
20
21
22 171 phrases based on the spacing of units into clusters; phrases that were similar were grouped into
23
24 172 themes, and themes were then grouped into songs. If a theme consisted of two or more sub-
25
26 173 phrases, each sub-phrase was labelled with the number of the corresponding theme followed by a
27
28
29 174 letter that coincided with the order of the phrases within the theme (e.g., 2a, 2b). Phrases that
30
31 175 changed subtly and progressively within a theme were defined as ‘shifting themes’ [18]. Themes
32
33 176 between individuals were considered to match when the pattern of units within a phrase were the
34
35
36
177 same and the units themselves were very similar, allowing for a small amount of variability due
37
38 178 to individual discrepancies [42].
39
40 179
41
42
180 Once all song cycles for each singer were transcribed, an assessment of the ‘typical’ song cycle
43
44
45 181 was undertaken for each singer in order to assign a ‘median’ sequence for further analysis [38].
46
47 182 This was done at the individual level by qualitatively examining the sequence of units and
48
49 183 phrases in each song cycle, determining the typical phrase/theme type and then the typical
50
51
52 184 phrases/theme sequence that makes up a typical or ‘median’ song type for each singer.
53
54 185 Due to the inherent inter-individual variability in humpback whale song, a 50% rule was applied

1
2
3 186 to determine the median or average string per singer [43]. At the unit level, if a unit was sung in
4
5
6 187 50% or more of the phrases/themes characterising a phrase/theme type then it was included into
7
8 188 the median phrase/theme type for that individual. For example, an individual may sing
9
10 189 phrase/theme 1 as moan, whoop, cry for the first song cycle but then consistently sing moan,
11
12
13
190 whoop, cry, cry for the rest of the four song cycles; the median phrase/theme type for that singer
14
15 191 would be moan, whoop, cry, cry. Similarly, if a phrase/theme type was present in at least 50% of
16
17 192 all song cycles analysed, then this was included in the median string used for the LSI analysis
18
19
193 For example, if over three song cycles a singer sung the phrase/theme sequence 1,2,3,4 but on
20
21
22 194 the fourth song cycle the singer sung the sequence 1,2,3,4,5, the median string for this singer
23
24 195 would be 1,2,3,4. Condensing the data to a single string per individual singer avoided biasing
25
26 196 the results towards singers for which there were a higher number of song sequences [43]. Due to
27
28
29 197 data constraints (small sample size) and recording quality (all units had to be recognisable with
30
31 198 good signal to noise ratio, and at least one complete song cycle for each singer), the number of
32
33 199 individuals recorded in each population per year varied (see Table 1).

41
42
203 In order to validate the qualitative unit level classification, and ensure that units classified by a
43
44
45 204 human classifier are similar across populations and years, twenty unit types were selected based
46
47 205 on the presence of unit types in the song of both populations (in at least one year or across
48
49 206 multiple years). The selected unit types were then sampled from different individuals in each
50
51
52 207 population and across years if applicable (Table 1). Time and frequency parameters of the
53
54 208 selected calls were measured using Raven Pro 1.4 (Hamming, 75% overlap, FFT size 1024

4
5
6 210 the calls, bandwidth (maximum - minimum frequency), frequency range (ratio of minimum /
7
8 211 maximum frequency), frequency trend (ration of start / end frequency), peak frequency (the
9
10 212 frequency at which the maximum power occurred in the call), duration of the call (s), and the
11
12
13
213 number of inflections (the change from ascending to descending frequency, or from descending
14
15 214 to ascending). These measurements were used in a Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
16
17 215 analysis using the rpart package in R [44] following previous analyses [15, 43, 45]. Rpart allows
18
19
216 statistical classification of humpback whale social calls using non-parametric classification tree
20
21
22 217 analysis with cross-validation [45]. CART analyses are robust to outliers, non-normal and non-
23
24 218 independent (correlated) data, and consider all measured variables when classifying calls [43, 45-
25
26 219 48].

29 220
30
31 221 Quantifying song similarity using the Levenshtein distance similarity index
32
33 222 To calculate song similarity among song types, populations and across years, we used the
34
35
36
223 Levenshtein distance similarity index (LSI). The LSI measures the similarity between any two
37
38 224 sequences or strings of data, by calculating the minimum number of changes (insertions,
39
40 225 deletions, or substitutions) to change one string into the other while taking into account string
41
42
226 length [43, 49]. This allows multiple strings to be compared to gain an overall understanding of
43
44
45 227 sequences within the dataset (see [43, 50] for a detailed explanation of the calculation of the
46
47 228 metric). Analyses were run using custom written software in R (see [50] for access). To ensure
48
49 229 the qualitative classification of themes was consistent, an initial LSI analysis was run to group
50
51
52 230 strings of units (phrase) into themes. Once themes were verified, song similarity among the
53
54 231 populations and years was investigated. Here, a string represents the median theme sequence

2
3 232 from each individual. The LSI was run and the matrix of song similarity was clustered using the
4
5
6 233 pvclust [51] and hclust packages in R [50]. Dendrograms were produced using average-linkage
7
8 234 (UPGMA, Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) clustering [43]. Each matrix
9
10 235 was also bootstrapped 1,000 times to assess uncertainty and the stability of the resulting
11
12
13
236 structure [43]. Bootstrapping was both multi-scale bootstrap resampling (AU; significant if p >
14
15 237 95%) and normal bootstrap probability (BP; significant if p > 70%) [15]; high AU and BP values
16
17 238 strongly support the divisions in the tree [50]. Each major branch of the tree represents a song
18
19
239 type regardless of the population, year or individual the song came from.

39
40 248 type had five themes, with theme 2 split into two sub-phrases. One notable difference, was that
41
42
249 Gabon sang a descending cry-woop as one unit, while Madagascar broke the unit into two,
43
44
45 250 singing a descending cry and then a woop, in phrase 1 (see Table 3). Although Gabon and
46
47 251 Madagascar had the same phrase 1 structure, Gabon sung a yap train while Madagascar sung a
48
49 252 snort train after a single grunt, at the start of theme 1.

3 254 In 2002, Gabon and Madagascar sung almost entirely different song types. Gabon’s song type
4
5
6 255 had six themes, including a shifting theme and multiple sub-phrases for theme 7 and 8. Both
7
8 256 populations sung theme 14, however Gabon sung a squeal-moan, while Madagascar sung a
9
10 257 descending cry. Madagascar’s song type consisted of sub-phrase 7c (repeated ascending moan or
11
12
13
258 moan, squeal) and four themes.
14
15 259
16
17 260 Gabon’s 2003 song type was elaborate; it consisted of one shifting theme (7s), nine standard
18
19
261 themes, and sub-phrase 7b that was sung the previous year by this population. Madagascar also
20
21
22 262 sung themes 7s, 11, 15, and 17, with one individual omitting theme 14 and replacing it with
23
24 263 theme 6, while Gabon sung theme 14 and 6 consecutively (see Table 3). The following year
25
26 264 theme 14 was not sung in either population, while theme 6 was present in both populations’ 2004
27
28
29 265 song.
30
31 266
32
33 267 In 2004, both populations continued to sing theme 7s, with one individual from Gabon singing
34
35
36
268 sub-phrase 7b from the previous year’s song in addition to the shifting theme. Gabon’s 2004
37
38 269 song type consisted of an evolution of theme 18 (18E), which was not seen in any of
39
40 270 Madagascar’s songs. In addition to theme 7s, themes 23, 24, and 25 were shared between both
41
42
271 populations in 2004. While Gabon’s theme 24 only consisted of sub-phrase 24a, Madagascar’s
43
44
45 272 theme 24 consisted of three sub-phrases (24a, 24b, 24c). Theme 23 usually consisted of a moan,
46
47 273 moan, descending cry, modulated moan, and a squeak train, but it is interesting to note that
48
49 274 Madagascar’s squeak trains were consistently longer than Gabon’s squeak trains.

10 279 sung the new 2005 song with the addition of 23E. In 2005, both populations sung theme 24 with
11
12
13
280 all three sub-phrases (24a, 24b, 24c). Gabon only sung phrase 27b, while individuals from
14
15 281 Madagascar sung sub-phrases 27a and 27b. In general, individuals in both populations sang
16
17 282 similar themes in the same order, with the exception of the two individuals mentioned above.

22 284 Classification tree analysis of units
23
24 285 Across all years, 477 calls were isolated from 30 recordings [Gabon-14; Madagascar-16] to be
25
26 286 used in the CART analysis (Table 1). Twenty examples of each call type were measured and the
27
28
29 287 CART analysis was used to validate the qualitative assignment of calls into call types. The
30
31 288 results of the CART analysis validated the qualitative call type classification (92.8% agreement),
32
33 289 with the majority of calls grouping into the same call categories as the manual call classification
34
35
36
290 (See Supplemental Materials). Although all variables were used during the splitting process,
37
38 291 maximum frequency and duration were the variables most often used in splitting call types.
39
40 292 There were 23 terminal nodes (call categories) generated compared to 20 qualitative categories.
41
42
293 The call types ‘groan’, ‘moan’, and ‘croak’ were split into two separate branches, explaining the
43
44
45 294 addition of three call categories based on the variables: duration (croak), maximum frequency
46
47 295 (moans), and end frequency (groan). This could indicate that these variables were not a defining
48
49 296 characteristic of such calls, or that these qualitative classifications require further refinement.

3 299 Overall, song similarity varied within and between populations and across the years of the study
4
5
6 300 (Table 2). In 2001, for example, there was 83.3% similarity between Gabon and Madagascar
7
8 301 song, whereas in 2002 there was only 11.1% similarity (Table 2). Song similarity then
9
10 302 progressively increased through the next three years (2003-2005) with 27.3%, 50%, and 87.5%
11
12
13
303 similarity, respectively (Table 2).
14
15 304
16
17 305 The average clustering method generated seven statistically significant clusters, each
18
19
306 representing a song type based on song similarity (Figure 2). Cluster one represents 2001 song
20
21
22 307 from both populations (AU/BP value of 100%), as a result of similar song between both
23
24 308 populations that year. Cluster two consisted of Madagascar’s 2002 song (AU/BP value of 100%),
25
26 309 while Gabon’s 2002 song was placed on the same overall branch but not within cluster four. It is
27
28
29 310 important to note that in 2002 song between Gabon and Madagascar displayed the lowest
30
31 311 similarity compared to any other year, despite the limited sample size. It is likely that even with a
32
33 312 larger sample size for Gabon’s song, the 2002 song would not be grouped into one vocal cluster.
34
35
36
313 For the 2003 song, each population was grouped into distinct clusters; cluster three (AU/BP
37
38 314 value of 100%) and four (AU/BP value of 100%), consisting of Gabon and Madagascar,
39
40 315 respectively. In 2005, populations sung similar songs resulting in the fifth cluster consisting of
41
42
316 both populations that year (AU/BP value of 100%), with the exception of one individual (#7)
43
44
45 317 from Gabon. This individual was grouped with cluster seven (AU/BP value of 96/94,
46
47 318 respectively) containing the 2004 Madagascar song. Cluster six consisted of the 2004 Gabon
48
49 319 song with an AU/BP value of 100/99, respectively.

3 322 Here, we have provided quantitative evidence of song exchange between the Madagascar and
4
5
6 323 Gabon populations over several years. In general, the degree of song similarity between the
7
8 324 Gabon and Madagascar populations support genetic studies suggesting a relatively high
9
10 325 migration rate between BSB and BSC populations, when compared to other populations within
11
12
13
326 the southern Atlantic and southern Indian Oceans [12]. However, the year-to-year variability in
14
15 327 song similarity found across the study period may indicate that these populations had more
16
17 328 acoustic contact in some years than others, and thus the opportunity for song learning and
18
19
329 exchange. As previously mentioned, song similarity between distinct breeding populations has
20
21
22 330 generally been reported for populations inhabiting the same ocean basin, as presumably there are
23
24 331 more opportunities for acoustic overlap of populations (i.e., see 23, 28, 29, 43, 52). The level of
25
26 332 song sharing between the Madagascar and Gabon populations located in different ocean basins,
27
28
29 333 and within the same year, is so far unreported for any other humpback whale population. The
30
31 334 findings from this study contribute valuable information towards understanding the dynamic
32
33 335 nature of song exchange between different humpbacks whale breeding populations, and how
34
35
36
336 patterns of song exchange may be used in conjunction with more traditional methods for
37
38 337 understanding population structure and connectivity of humpback whales on contemporary time
39
40 338 scales [15].
41
42
339
43
44
45 340 The patterns of song similarity and divergence found both in this study and others in the
46
47 341 Southern Hemisphere (e.g. 26, 28, 33), across multiple years, reinforces the idea of broad-scale
48
49 342 connectivity in Southern Hemisphere populations [53-54]. However, there appears to be a higher
50
51
52 343 level of within-year song similarity between Gabon and Madagascar than in other Southern
53
54 344 Hemisphere populations [see 26, 33, 43]. There was no evidence of the song ‘revolutions’

2
3 345 reported between the east and west Australian populations [26, 33], and neighbouring South
4
5
6 346 Pacific populations [43]. Song revolutions occur when one population completely copies the
7
8 347 song type of the neighbouring population from the year prior, leading to between-year song
9
10 348 replacement rather than within-year song sharing [26, 33, 43]. Song revolutions have so far only
11
12
13
349 been reported occurring in the afore mentioned Southern Hemisphere populations, and are not
14
15 350 present in Northern Hemisphere populations despite numerous historical studies reporting
16
17 351 various degrees of song sharing depending on proximity and opportunities for acoustic exchange
18
19
352 [23, 29, 55]. Song learning opportunities in Southern Hemisphere populations may be restricted
20
21
22 353 to the limited singing that may occur on overlapping feeding grounds [56-57], or individuals
23
24 354 migrating with neighbouring populations due to the barriers to dispersal on the breeding grounds
25
26 355 along the coast of the major continents. We still know little about song learning and transmission
27
28
29 356 in humpback whales but it has been suggested that song revolutions may occur when there are a
30
31 357 ‘threshold’ number of males singing the new song type, which then instigates song change
32
33 358 within surrounding males, eventually spreading throughout the population [26]. One plausible
34
35
36
359 explanation for the higher level of within year song similarity found in the African populations is
37
38 360 that there may be more opportunity for song learning on more closely aligned migration routes
39
40 361 around the relatively narrow tip of the African continent, or on overlapping feeding grounds.
41
42
362
43
44
45 363 On the feeding grounds, there are considered to be six distinct feeding grounds designated as
46
47 364 management areas by the IWC that correspond with the seven breeding stocks (see supplemental
48
49 365 materials). Gabon is associated with Area II, while Madagascar is associated with Area III [58].
50
51
52 366 A recent study by Amaral et al. [59] investigated genetic structure on Southern Hemisphere
53
54 367 feeding grounds and found little genetic structure between areas, suggesting high levels of
55
56
57
58
59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 33 of 57 Royal Society Open Science: For review only

2
3 368 interchange and overlap of breeding stocks on the Southern Ocean feeding grounds [59]. Genetic
4
5
6 369 diversity was higher in Areas II and III when compared to other areas, such as I and V [59].
7
8 370 Higher genetic diversity in Areas II and III, where Gabon and Madagascar are suggested to feed,
9
10 371 could indicate mixing on feeding grounds, or a single feeding ground shared by both populations.
11
12
13
372 When examining mtDNA (the maternal lineage), strong differentiation was shown between Area
14
15 373 III and other feeding areas [59]. This suggests mixing may be male mediated, which would allow
16
17 374 for cultural transmission of song, a male breeding display, between breeding stocks. It remains
18
19
375 unclear however whether males are coming into acoustic contact on shared migration routes,
20
21
22 376 shared feeding grounds, or by individuals moving between populations.
23
24 377
25
26 378 One potential driver for population mixing on feeding grounds is movement to find limited or
27
28
29 379 patchy food resources. Humpback whales may be making longer migrations due to their preys’
30
31 380 temporal distribution, which is dependent on seasonal variables such as sea ice retreat [60-61].
32
33 381 The primary prey source for humpback whales is Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and
34
35
36
382 feeding areas directly south of Gabon and Madagascar reportedly contain lower densities of krill,
37
38 383 perhaps forcing movement to other areas to improve feeding opportunities [62]. Rekdahl (2012)
39
40 384 [33] suggested that oceanographic conditions affecting prey distribution may be one factor
41
42
385 leading to the episodic connectivity and song exchange between BSD and BSE (west and east
43
44
45 386 Australian) populations. A recent study by Seyboth et al. [63], found significant correlations
46
47 387 between Southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) calving rates and krill density, providing
48
49 388 another example of prey density and distribution effects on populations [63]. Prey distribution
50
51
52 389 may therefore be one factor leading to population mixing and song sharing between Gabon and
53
54 390 Madagascar. A tagging study by Trudelle et al. (2016) [64], found humpback whales may use

58
59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 34 of 57
1
2
3 391 ocean currents to maximise movement on and around breeding grounds. Similar factors may be
4
5
6 392 enabling or influencing different levels of connectivity on feeding grounds and on migration in
7
8 393 different years. However, further research linking humpback whale movement with
9
10 394 oceanographic variables and prey distribution is required.
11
12
13
395
14
15 396 Although there were no song revolutions found in the Madagascar or Gabon populations, there
16
17 397 was an almost complete song divergence in 2002, which reduced song similarity from over 83%
18
19
398 down to only 11% in one year. A study by Darling and Sousa-Lima [53] identified song
20
21
22 399 similarity between Gabon (BSB) and Brazil (BSA) in 2002, suggesting that these two breeding
23
24 400 stocks, or at least individuals from these two populations, came into close proximity at some
25
26 401 point during that year or the preceding year to enable song learning to occur. It would seem
27
28
29 402 likely therefore that there was song transmission between the Brazil and the Gabon populations
30
31 403 that then led to the rapid evolution and divergence of the Gabon song from 2001 to 2002. The
32
33 404 2002 Gabon song (influenced by Brazil) then spread to Madagascar in 2003, sharing some
34
35
36
405 themes that were adopted from Gabon’s 2002 song (see Figure 3). This transmission of a song in
37
38 406 an easterly direction has been documented to repeatedly occur between east and west Australia
39
40 407 [33] and in the South Pacific populations [28]. Song similarity has also been documented
41
42
408 between east Africa and west Australian populations in the southern Indian Ocean [65].
43
44
45 409 However, there was only one shared theme documented across a single year which suggests
46
47 410 limited song exchange [65]. Further research comparing song from all Southern Hemisphere
48
49 411 populations may elucidate further complex patterns of song exchange and provide valuable
50
51
52 412 information on fine-scale population connectivity patterns.

3 414 Conclusions
4
5
6 415 Our study reinforces the use of acoustic methods to investigate humpback whale population
7
8 416 connectivity, and we advocate the use of this method to support genetic and photo-identification
9
10 417 studies. However, as with all methods, limitations do exist. Song analysis is limited to males and
11
12
13
418 may not accurately reflect female movement. Further, although we used a quantitative measure
14
15 419 of song similarity (LD analysis), the initial song comparison was based on a qualitative
16
17 420 assessment of song. We support this approach for broad-scale song assessment (see 10, 26, 33,
18
19
421 40) however we suggest further research into quantitative measures for investigating factors that
20
21
22 422 may be driving song learning and change on a finer scale. Despite a smaller sample size in some
23
24 423 years, our results further reinforce the complex interactions between Southern Hemisphere
25
26 424 populations suggested by other work, and have provided valuable information on fine-scale
27
28
29 425 connectivity patterns between Gabon and Madagascar populations. Future research should
30
31 426 incorporate Brazil along with all other Southern Hemisphere populations in order to look at song
32
33 427 exchange at a broader geographic level, to understand the complex interactions and mechanisms
34
35
36
428 that drive the cultural transmission of song.

Appendix D
Review of Rekdahl, Carvajal, Garland, Collins, Razafindrakoto and
Rosenbaum (Royal Society) “Culturally transmitted song exchange
between Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the southeast
Atlantic and southwest Indian ocean basins.”
Specific Comments
Introduction:
P.22, 124-126: I still don’t understand why the only opportunity for
song exchange between sub-stocks can only occur either on their
shared latitude feeding ground or on a shared migration route. In line
116-119 you seem to say that individuals from one breeding ground
can occur on a different breeding ground on different years. Since we
assume that not all whales will necessarily always go to the same
breeding ground each year, why can song exchange not happen when
one or more individuals from BSB decide to instead go to BSC one
year? I don’t mean go to both breeding areas during the same season
(clearly not feasible), but rather during successive seasons. Could it
not be that the influence of one or more individuals from a different
population singing a slightly different song is what drives the intra-
and inter-seasonal evolution of the song on a particular breeding
ground? In other words, a few individuals visiting from BSB singing
their BSB song causes the BSC whales to gradually adopt their
variation (or vice-versa). What evidence against this scenario do you
have to exclude this possibility? If you do NOT have good evidence
against it, then you should include the possibility in your speculation
of how song exchange occurs and not limit the possibilities for where
and how song exchange takes place.
Discussion:
P.32, 352-355: Same comment as above. Why are you so fixated on
song learning opportunities only being possible on the feeding grounds
or migration grounds? Why is it so difficult to imagine that
individuals moving between breeding grounds during successive
seasons are the vectors of song change?
P. 33, 374-376: You acknowledge this uncertainty here, so why not
elsewhere in the manuscript as well?
Appendix E
Response to Referees: RSOS-172305. Culturally transmitted song exchange
between Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the southeast
Atlantic and southwest Indian ocean basins. Rekdahl et al.
We thank the reviewers for their thorough and helpful comments to
improve this manuscript.
Given the continued and valid reservations by reviewers with our
analyses, we have taken the time to undertake a full re-analysis of all
data.
Specifically we:
1. Measured all unit types for 10 acoustic features (following
Rekdahl et al. 2013). Units were measured from the first
phrase rendition of each phrase type/theme from every singer.
This provides a far more robust classification of unit types
within and among singers (N=1,571 units measured). Unit
classifications were then re-tested using CART. See 176-200
2. Phrase types/themes were classified based on the sequence
of units using LSI. This reduces qualitative decisions and in
turn also verifies theme groupings. The LSI was run as a
weighted analysis which allows the qualitative choice of
‘similar units in similar positions’ to be quantified. Similarity in
unit types is based on the similarity in acoustic feature space
as assessed using the measurements for CART. See 219-231
3. All theme sequences were included in analyses, not just the
singular 50% decision sequence. Such a qualitative decision
has been removed entirely (and from all LSI analyses). All
theme sequences making up a song were included (especially
those that were not the classic sequence as such sequences
are an important part of the variability that is song). Median
sequences where used, are calculated by the LSI analysis and
are based on all sequences. These sequences can be found in
the Supplementary Material Table S3. We also ran analyses
with the full sequence of phrases, including repeats, to ensure
the dividing of the song session into songs did not alter what
was being sung. See L235-240.
4. We ran analyses at the individual recording/singer level, not
lumped into the population/year level due to the sparse data.
This makes groupings based on each recording allowing the
reader to make their own judgements about clusters and also
the amount of data present.
5. Given the small sample size we decided to implement a
second, simpler analysis based on presence of themes. Dice’s
similarity index was run following Garland et al (2015) to
provide a broader overview of what phrase types were present
and did not rely in any way on the sequence of theme. See
L242-251.
We have also attempted to further acknowledge the limitations of the
sample size throughout the manuscript. E.g., L335, L353, L363, L429,
L439.
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Generally, I believe the conclusions of this paper – and I think if the authors
were to tread carefully it could be an important addition to the literature,
however they have not (treaded carefully)… The paper still suffers from very
small sample sizes combined with (perhaps overly and arguably unnecessary)
complex quantitative analysis, which gets it onto very thin ice. The
impression I have is that they knew the points they want to discuss and were
determined to get there – regardless of the underlying weaknesses of some of
the data. This is not to say the points are not important and accurate (and
might well be the same reached with better sample sizes). Hence it’s
frustrating to review.
We have further acknowledged the small sample size issue. E.g.,
L335, L353, L363, L429, L439.
The authors added more basic data (such as details on samples), clarifications
on methodology and new presentations of information not in the first version
and these are welcome improvements. I am not going to go through each
response: in my view some were adequate; others less so. However the
authors have chosen to argue several of the fundamental issues I had with the
first version rather than change anything. I understand/respect this approach
but, considering the level of quantitative analyses in the paper, I did not buy
the sample size arguments… this now an editorial decision.
Example: the main defense to the criticism that the sample size is small in
some cases is that “…there were no more samples available to analyze.”
Unfortunately this does not solve the sample size problem, especially
considering the quantitative analysis undertaken. I wish it did. To solve it
only two choices: 1) increase sample size or 2) do not do the
analysis. Neither was option taken.
We have included a more basic P/A analysis, Dice’s similarity index,
to more adequately address the limitations of the sample size. As
noted above, we have also included all sequences in the LSI analysis,
not just a singular 50% string.
Example: In addressing the comments on version #1 the authors have added
key information to Table 1 -- however a statement in their response
increased rather than lessoned my questioning of this. They state that the data
is “…more than a decade old…” and “… do not have the date of the
recordings”. So this particular element of the study is based on one undated
recording from more than 10 years ago? --- a fact we only learned after
questioning of the first version ?
I have increasing (although not conclusive) reservations about the value of
the Levenshtein Index – or more specifically, the treatment the song requires
for usability in this index. If used, there needs to be a justification for its use,
beyond that is what others are doing. For example, what is the justification
for simply ‘not using’ songs where the order of the themes was not the
straight 12345, beyond the fact that this disorder screws up the LI
calculation? In some cases (locations/years) repetitiveness or alternation of
the themes is more the rule than the exception. How many songs were
discarded due to this characteristic? And, I still do not understand the
justification for eliminating phrases not in 50% of song cycles (beyond that it
makes the LI index work). Where does this get us in the real comparison of
the song composition?
We have reanalysed all data to address this valid point raised by the
reviewer. The treatment of song data for LSI needs to be clear, logical
and still be representative of the real song composition. All sequences
are now included regardless of whether they are the straight 12345 or
any other combination. The 50% rule has been abandoned entirely,
and any median sequences are generated by the analysis itself from
all sequences (including aberrant, repetitive or alternating songs).
Importantly, analyses can be run on all sequences without the need
for a median and the variability of all sequences can be included (this
is the theme matrix output used herein). See L203 onwards
We also ran the full utterance of phrases with repeats as a preliminary
analysis to ground-truth the song LSI (i.e. it is the real sequence of
utterances (the song session) without need for division into each
song).
We also conducted a separate analysis (Dice’s SI) based on presence
of phrase types, which does not use any sequential information. This
provides an alternative to LSI but is also a good test for the LSI. See
L242-251. The LSI and Dice’s provide complementary results which
strengthens the use of both (as slightly different information goes into
each, e.g., P/A vs. sequence).
In reading though the comments of the other reviewers and the authors
responses I found myself mostly agreeing with the reviewers – and with
mixed acceptance of the authors explanations, changes or arguments. My
summary: I think the information in the paper is fundamentally legit and
would like to see it published in some form --- but the small (ranging to
unacceptable) sample sizes (with no attempt to restructure the paper after this
criticism), in combination with complex (and difficult to describe/justify)
analysis and a tendency to overstate some of the results in Discussion makes
it very difficult to recommend in this form.

say that individuals from one breeding ground can occur on a different
breeding ground on different years. Since we assume that not all whales will
necessarily always go to the same breeding ground each year, why can song
exchange not happen when one or more individuals from BSB decide to
instead go to BSC one year? I don’t mean go to both breeding areas during
the same season (clearly not feasible), but rather during successive seasons.
Could it not be that the influence of one or more individuals from a different
population singing a slightly different song is what drives the intra- and inter-
seasonal evolution of the song on a particular breeding ground? In other
words, a few individuals visiting from BSB singing their BSB song causes
the BSC whales to gradually adopt their variation (or vice-versa). What
evidence against this scenario do you have to exclude this possibility? If you
do NOT have good evidence against it, then you should include the
possibility in your speculation of how song exchange occurs and not limit the
possibilities for where and how song exchange takes place.
Discussion:
P.17, 442-446: Same comment as above. Why are you so fixated on song
learning opportunities only being possible on the feeding grounds or
migration grounds? Why is it so difficult to imagine that individuals moving
between breeding grounds during successive seasons are the vectors of song
change?
P. 17, 460-471: You acknowledge this uncertainty here, so why not
elsewhere in the
manuscript as well?
We have included the movement of individuals between seasons as
an explanation of song transmission throughout the manuscript. E.g.

Comments to the Author(s)
General comments:
The authors have made a good faith attempt to address many of my concerns
as expressed in my review of their first submission of this paper. Alas, the
two most fundamental of these concerns remain, and those are: a) the
extremely small amount of acoustic data and b) the highly subjective and
inadequate nature of the acoustic feature analyses by which the authors
derive metrics for song sharing.
I'm pretty certain that my continued low evaluation of this paper in its present
form will be frustrating for the authors, just as I am adamant that the present
combination of subjective assessment of humpback song unit types and a
seriously inadequate set of acoustic features for classifying unit types is
insufficient for a high resolution unit comparison attempt. What the authors
need to do is come up with an acoustic feature set for song units that has a
high likelihood of providing a quantitative measure of similarity-difference.
Without conquering this first step, and especially given the anemic sample
size, no amount of CART and LSI analysis will return a defensible result.
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and as noted above, have
reanalysed and re-measured our song units to include all unit types.
See L176-217
The quantitative measure of similarity-difference of unit types was
implemented following Garland et al. (2017, JASA) to create a matrix
of unit similarity based on acoustic feature space. This was included
in analyses as a weighting to remove subjective decisions about
same/different units. See L219-231
On a more positive perspective. I do not doubt actually that male singers in
these two populations share song features, most likely at multiple song levels
(i.e., notes, phrases). Humpback males singers, are known to be very labile in
their song learning behaviors. They sing throughout many, many months of
the year while in pretty much all regions of their annual movement cycles.
As nicely discussed by the authors, the inclusion of acoustics as a measure of
population interchange, at least for breeding males, is important, especially
when integrated with evidence from other tools (biopsy, photo-ID), because
it can provide evidence of cultural interchange at very short time scales. My
concern then is that this paper, if published as is, would support the
continued use of impoverished acoustic analysis methods that were prevalent
and semi-acceptable in the last century. Such methods should not be
encouraged today. These methods cannot reveal features of humpback
behavioral acoustic ecology that could actually enable deeper levels of
hypothesis testing, for example, elucidate whether or not singing is an index
or handicap signal. Regarding my plea for adequate feature analysis, I'm
pretty certain that the authors do not have the resources to complete any new
acoustic analysis.
We agree – we have updated all analysis methods to reflect where
the current field is at in terms of song comparisons and unit
classifications. This removes qualitative decisions as much as
possible and includes two quantitative comparisons of song.
Given lack of resources, what do I suggest if this reanalysis is too much to
bear and the authors want to resubmit? Do a much, much better job of
showing unit type similarities and differences. As the figures and tables
presently stand, it is not possible for me (and I suspect even the
unsophisticated reader) to adequately discern the authors' judgements about
unit type sharing by looking at spectrograms. The examples in the Figure 3
are tiny and presented in an odd way (sort of like a gel?). Why is there not a
figure that shows clear examples of song sharing between places and years?
If I cannot observe and evaluate at that level, then all the bells and whistles
that follow bring little to no weight to the paper's claims of song sharing with
such an tiny sample size. A similar component of any rewrite is that the
paper needs to unambiguously from the beginning and throughout clearly
acknowledge the very, very limited amount of acoustic data. Also, in the
methods, there needs to be a clear an unambiguous admission as to the limits
of their feature measurement process, which by its very nature blurs
distinctions between song units such that it lumps at a rather gross level.
We have reanalysed the data as noted above.
The file I attach is the PDF version of the paper with my many comments. I
do this rather than write out a separate list. One of those needs to be repeated
here and adequately addressed in any rewite/resubmission.
On line 367 I comment: "You cannot say that these data represent song at the
population level with totals of 14 singers (Gabon ) and 16 singers
(Madagascar) over a 5 year sampling period (average recording 54.7 min SD
35 min Gabon, 87.3 min SD 38 min Madagascar). These data represent song
at the level of a few individuals whose songs were evaluated based on very
brief acoustic samples (Gabon 58 songs, ave 4.1 SD 2.8/singer; Madagascar
78 songs, ave 4.8 SD 2.1/singer). Placing these results within the proper data
level is imperative. This is not a population level acoustic comparison of
song similarity. It was an attempt at that level, but does not in any way pass
the litmus test of a population level comparison. It points to and perhaps
suggests a possible population level interchange, but the acoustic analytics
are insufficient for this comparison because they are too subjective and the
sample size is too small.
We have reworded the manuscript more conservatively to reflect this
point. E.g., see L341, L363.
The figures for the results are insufficient and do not demonstrate an
adequate comparative level by which to conclude acoustic similarity. The
features used in the comparative analysis do not yield acoustic identities: that
is, you cannot use these feature sets alone to regenerate the sounds they
represent. As a result, the feature measurement process intrinsically lumps
sounds together and is not well designed to enable adequate differentiation
between different unit types.
We have remedied this with the reanalysis noted above. We have
also included a table with unit sequences for each
location/year/phrase type to allow comparison (Table 2).
The discussion makes some very appropriate points and is pretty much on
target. The references are pretty thorough, but i did not cross check with text.
Thank you.

We have amended our manuscript following the specific wording
changes suggested in your PDF.

patterns, as there can be cultural exchange of a single, population-wide shared song type with
n
neighbouring populations in acoustic contact. Here, we investigated song exchange between
m
populations located on the east and west coasts of Africa using five years of concurrent data
i
(2001-2005). Songs were qualitatively and quantitatively transcribed by measuring acoustic
g
features of all song units, and then compared using both Dice’sboth D i c e ’ s similarity index
r
and the Levenshtein distance metric to quantitatively calculate song similarity. Song similarity
a
varied among individuals and potentially between populations depending on the year (Dice:
t
36%-100%, LSI: 21%-100%), suggesting varying levels of population connectivity and/or
o
interchange among years. The high degree of song sharing indicated in this study further
r
supports genetic studies that demonstrate interchange between these two populations, and
y
reinforces the emerging picture of broad-scale connectivity in Southern Hemisphere populations.

Further research incorporating additional populations and years would be invaluable for better

Acoustic Analysis
n
Humpback whale songs are highly stereotyped [16] and are arranged in a nested hierarchy (unit,
k
phrase, theme) [16, 18, 41, 42]. A unit is the most fundamental level representing an individual
n
sound. Units occur in stereotyped sequences called phrases, which can be composed of sub-
o
phrases of one or more similar or different units which are often repeated in a sequence [21, 42].
w
Phrases are then repeated any number of times to create themes, and themes are sung in a
n
particular order to compose the song [16, 18, 20, 21, 42]. A song was defined as a stereotyped Commented [CWC16]: Typically, but not always.

Finally, in 2005, the song types from Gabon and Madagascar were overall similar (See Tables 2

and 3, and Fig. 2 for further details). Both populations predominately sung themes 7s, 24, 26, and
i
27, with a few individual differences. Specifically, individual seven from Gabon sung two themes
n
from the previous year (6 and 18E), as well as an evolution of theme 23 (23E). One individual

from Madagascar (individual 18) also sang theme 23E. In general, individuals in both populations

Song similarity
c
Overall, song similarity varied between individuals, and therefore potentially between
o
populations and across the years of the study. In 2001, for example, there was between 29% and
n
57% (LSI; Dice: 91-100%) song similarity between Gabon and Madagascar singers, whereas in
s
2002 there was only 21% to 30% song similarity (LSI; Dice: 50-62%; Table S3). However, the
i
Gabon 2002 data contained a single singer, warranting caution with interpretation. Song
s
similarity then progressively increased through the next three years between the populations
t
(2003: 21-35% and 36-62%, 2004: 49-60%, and 83-91%, 2005: 44-100% and 44-100%, LSI and

Dice’s SI respectively; Table S3).

between distinct breeding populations has generally been reported for populations inhabiting the

same ocean basin, as presumably there are more opportunities for acoustic overlap of
a
populations (i.e., see 25, 30, 31, 45, 56). The level of song sharing between the Madagascar and

Gabon populations located in different ocean basins, and within the same year, is so far

unreported for any other humpback whale population. The findings from this study contribute Commented [CWC34]: But who has tried this same

The patterns of song similarity and divergence found both in this study and others in the
s
Southern Hemisphere (e.g., [28, 30, 35]), across multiple years, reinforces the idea of broad-scale

connectivity in Southern Hemisphere populations [57-58]. However, there appears to be a higher

level of within-year song similarity between Gabon and Madagascar than in other Southern

Hemisphere populations (see [28, 35, 45]), but a larger sample size is warranted. There was no
c
evidence of the song ‘revolutions’ reported between the east and west Australian populations
o
[28, 35], and neighbouring South Pacific populations [45]. A song revolution occurs when one

population completely copies the song type of the neighbouring population from the year prior,

leading to between-year song replacement rather than within-year song sharing [28, 35, 45].

numer

eventually spreading throughout the population [28]. One plausible explanation for the higher
histori
level of within year song similarity found in the African populations is that there may be more

opportunity for song learning on more closely aligned migration routes around the relatively

Six distinct feeding grounds (termed ‘Areas’) are designated by the IWC that correspond with

the seven breeding stocks (see Supplemental Materials). Gabon is associated with Area II, while

Madagascar is associated with Area III [60]. A recent study by Amaral et al. [61] investigated

m
a
One potential driver for population mixing on feeding grounds is movement to find limited or
l
patchy food resources. Humpback whales may be making longer migrations due to their preys’
e
temporal distribution, which is dependent on seasonal variables such as sea ice retreat [62-63].

The primary prey source for humpback whales is Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and

feeding areas directly south of Gabon and Madagascar reportedly contain lower densities of krill,
r
perhaps forcing movement to other areas to improve feeding opportunities [64]. Rekdahl [35]
e
suggested that oceanographic conditions affecting prey distribution may be one factor leading to
c
the episodic connectivity and song exchange between BSD and BSE (west and east Australian)

populations. A recent study by Seyboth et al. [65], found significant correlations between

Southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) calving rates and krill density, providing another

example of prey density and distribution effects on populations [65]. Prey distribution may

therefore be one factor leading to population mixing and song sharing between Gabon and

Madagascar. A tagging study by Trudelle et al. [66], found humpback whales may use ocean

currents to maximise movement on and around breeding grounds. Similar factors may be

10 Given the continued and valid reservations by reviewers with our analyses, we have
11 taken the time to undertake a full re-analysis of all data.
12 Specifically we:
13 1. Measured all unit types for 10 acoustic features (following Rekdahl et al.
14 2013). Units were measured from the first phrase rendition of each phrase
15 type/theme from every singer. This provides a far more robust classification of
16 unit types within and among singers (N=1,571 units measured). Unit
17 classifications were then re-tested using CART. See 176-200
18 2. Phrase types/themes were classified based on the sequence of units using
19 LSI. This reduces qualitative decisions and in turn also verifies theme
20 groupings. The LSI was run as a weighted analysis which allows the
21 qualitative choice of ‘similar units in similar positions’ to be quantified.
22 Similarity in unit types is based on the similarity in acoustic feature space as
23 assessed using the measurements for CART. See 219-231
24 3. All theme sequences were included in analyses, not just the singular 50%
25 decision sequence. Such a qualitative decision has been removed entirely
26 (and from all LSI analyses). All theme sequences making up a song were
27 included (especially those that were not the classic sequence as such
28 sequences are an important part of the variability that is song). Median
29 sequences where used, are calculated by the LSI analysis and are based on
30 all sequences. These sequences can be found in the Supplementary Material
31 Table S3. We also ran analyses with the full sequence of phrases, including
32 repeats, to ensure the dividing of the song session into songs did not alter
33 what was being sung. See L235-240.
34 4. We ran analyses at the individual recording/singer level, not lumped into the
35 population/year level due to the sparse data. This makes groupings based on
36 each recording allowing the reader to make their own judgements about
37 clusters and also the amount of data present.
38 5. Given the small sample size we decided to implement a second, simpler
39 analysis based on presence of themes. Dice’s similarity index was run
following Garland et al (2015) to provide a broader overview of what phrase
40 types were present and did not rely in any way on the sequence of theme.
41
See L242-251.
42
43
We have also attempted to further acknowledge the limitations of the sample size
44
throughout the manuscript. E.g., L335, L353, L363, L429, L439.

50 Comments to the Author(s)
51 Generally, I believe the conclusions of this paper – and I think if the authors were to tread
52 carefully it could be an important addition to the literature, however they have not (treaded
53 carefully)… The paper still suffers from very small sample sizes combined with (perhaps
54 overly and arguably unnecessary) complex quantitative analysis, which gets it onto very thin
55 ice. The impression I have is that they knew the points they want to discuss and were
56 determined to get there – regardless of the underlying weaknesses of some of the data. This is
57

2
3 not to say the points are not important and accurate (and might well be the same reached with
4 better sample sizes). Hence it’s frustrating to review.
5
6 We have further acknowledged the small sample size issue. E.g., L335, L353, L363,
7 L429, L439.
8
9 The authors added more basic data (such as details on samples), clarifications on
10 methodology and new presentations of information not in the first version and these are
11 welcome improvements. I am not going to go through each response: in my view some were
12 adequate; others less so. However the authors have chosen to argue several of the
13 fundamental issues I had with the first version rather than change anything. I
14 understand/respect this approach but, considering the level of quantitative analyses in the
15 paper, I did not buy the sample size arguments… this now an editorial decision.
16
17 Example: the main defense to the criticism that the sample size is small in some cases is that
18 “…there were no more samples available to analyze.” Unfortunately this does not solve the
19 sample size problem, especially considering the quantitative analysis undertaken. I wish it
20 did. To solve it only two choices: 1) increase sample size or 2) do not do the
21 analysis. Neither was option taken.
22
23 We have included a more basic P/A analysis, Dice’s similarity index, to more
24 adequately address the limitations of the sample size. As noted above, we have also
25 included all sequences in the LSI analysis, not just a singular 50% string.
26
27 Example: In addressing the comments on version #1 the authors have added key information
28 to Table 1 -- however a statement in their response increased rather than lessoned my
29 questioning of this. They state that the data is “…more than a decade old…” and “… do not
30 have the date of the recordings”. So this particular element of the study is based on one
31 undated recording from more than 10 years ago? --- a fact we only learned after questioning
32 of the first version ?
33 I have increasing (although not conclusive) reservations about the value of the Levenshtein
34 Index – or more specifically, the treatment the song requires for usability in this index. If
35 used, there needs to be a justification for its use, beyond that is what others are doing. For
36 example, what is the justification for simply ‘not using’ songs where the order of the themes
37 was not the straight 12345, beyond the fact that this disorder screws up the LI calculation? In
38 some cases (locations/years) repetitiveness or alternation of the themes is more the rule than
39 the exception. How many songs were discarded due to this characteristic? And, I still do not
40 understand the justification for eliminating phrases not in 50% of song cycles (beyond that it
41 makes the LI index work). Where does this get us in the real comparison of the song
42 composition?
43
44
We have reanalysed all data to address this valid point raised by the reviewer. The
45
46 treatment of song data for LSI needs to be clear, logical and still be representative of
the real song composition. All sequences are now included regardless of whether
47
they are the straight 12345 or any other combination. The 50% rule has been
48
49 abandoned entirely, and any median sequences are generated by the analysis itself
from all sequences (including aberrant, repetitive or alternating songs). Importantly,
50
analyses can be run on all sequences without the need for a median and the
51
variability of all sequences can be included (this is the theme matrix output used
52
herein). See L203 onwards
53
We also ran the full utterance of phrases with repeats as a preliminary analysis to
54
ground-truth the song LSI (i.e. it is the real sequence of utterances (the song
55
session) without need for division into each song).

3 We also conducted a separate analysis (Dice’s SI) based on presence of phrase
4 types, which does not use any sequential information. This provides an alternative to
5 LSI but is also a good test for the LSI. See L242-251. The LSI and Dice’s provide
6 complementary results which strengthens the use of both (as slightly different
7 information goes into each, e.g., P/A vs. sequence).
8
9 In reading though the comments of the other reviewers and the authors responses I found
10 myself mostly agreeing with the reviewers – and with mixed acceptance of the authors
11 explanations, changes or arguments. My summary: I think the information in the paper is
12 fundamentally legit and would like to see it published in some form --- but the small (ranging
13 to unacceptable) sample sizes (with no attempt to restructure the paper after this criticism), in
14 combination with complex (and difficult to describe/justify) analysis and a tendency to
15 overstate some of the results in Discussion makes it very difficult to recommend in this form.

24 Specific Comments
25 Introduction:
26 P.6, 137-140: I still don’t understand why the only opportunity for song exchange between
27 sub-stocks can only occur either on their shared latitude feeding ground or on a shared
28 migration route. In line 116-119 you seem to say that individuals from one breeding ground
29 can occur on a different breeding ground on different years. Since we assume that not all
30 whales will necessarily always go to the same breeding ground each year, why can song
31 exchange not happen when one or more individuals from BSB decide to instead go to BSC
32 one year? I don’t mean go to both breeding areas during the same season (clearly not
33 feasible), but rather during successive seasons. Could it not be that the influence of one or
34 more individuals from a different population singing a slightly different song is what drives
35 the intra- and inter-seasonal evolution of the song on a particular breeding ground? In other
36 words, a few individuals visiting from BSB singing their BSB song causes the BSC whales to
37 gradually adopt their variation (or vice-versa). What evidence against this scenario do you
38 have to exclude this possibility? If you do NOT have good evidence against it, then you
39 should include the possibility in your speculation of how song exchange occurs and not limit
40 the possibilities for where and how song exchange takes place.
41 Discussion:
42 P.17, 442-446: Same comment as above. Why are you so fixated on song learning
43 opportunities only being possible on the feeding grounds or migration grounds? Why is it so
44 difficult to imagine that individuals moving between breeding grounds during successive
45 seasons are the vectors of song change?
46
47
P. 17, 460-471: You acknowledge this uncertainty here, so why not elsewhere in the
48
manuscript as well?
49
50 We have included the movement of individuals between seasons as an explanation
51 of song transmission throughout the manuscript. E.g. L131-132

3 General comments:
4 The authors have made a good faith attempt to address many of my concerns as expressed in
5 my review of their first submission of this paper. Alas, the two most fundamental of these
6 concerns remain, and those are: a) the extremely small amount of acoustic data and b) the
7 highly subjective and inadequate nature of the acoustic feature analyses by which the authors
8 derive metrics for song sharing.
9
10 I'm pretty certain that my continued low evaluation of this paper in its present form will be
11 frustrating for the authors, just as I am adamant that the present combination of subjective
12 assessment of humpback song unit types and a seriously inadequate set of acoustic features
13 for classifying unit types is insufficient for a high resolution unit comparison attempt. What
14 the authors need to do is come up with an acoustic feature set for song units that has a high
15 likelihood of providing a quantitative measure of similarity-difference. Without conquering
16 this first step, and especially given the anemic sample size, no amount of CART and LSI
17 analysis will return a defensible result.
18
19 We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and as noted above, have reanalysed and
20 re-measured our song units to include all unit types. See L176-217
21 The quantitative measure of similarity-difference of unit types was implemented
22 following Garland et al. (2017, JASA) to create a matrix of unit similarity based on
23 acoustic feature space. This was included in analyses as a weighting to remove
24 subjective decisions about same/different units. See L219-231
25
26 On a more positive perspective. I do not doubt actually that male singers in these two
27 populations share song features, most likely at multiple song levels (i.e., notes, phrases).
28 Humpback males singers, are known to be very labile in their song learning behaviors. They
29 sing throughout many, many months of the year while in pretty much all regions of their
30 annual movement cycles. As nicely discussed by the authors, the inclusion of acoustics as a
31 measure of population interchange, at least for breeding males, is important, especially when
32 integrated with evidence from other tools (biopsy, photo-ID), because it can provide evidence
33 of cultural interchange at very short time scales. My concern then is that this paper, if
34 published as is, would support the continued use of impoverished acoustic analysis methods
35 that were prevalent and semi-acceptable in the last century. Such methods should not be
36 encouraged today. These methods cannot reveal features of humpback behavioral acoustic
37 ecology that could actually enable deeper levels of hypothesis testing, for example, elucidate
38 whether or not singing is an index or handicap signal. Regarding my plea for adequate feature
39 analysis, I'm pretty certain that the authors do not have the resources to complete any new
40 acoustic analysis.
41 We agree – we have updated all analysis methods to reflect where the current field is
42 at in terms of song comparisons and unit classifications. This removes qualitative
43 decisions as much as possible and includes two quantitative comparisons of song.
44
45
46 Given lack of resources, what do I suggest if this reanalysis is too much to bear and the
authors want to resubmit? Do a much, much better job of showing unit type similarities and
47
differences. As the figures and tables presently stand, it is not possible for me (and I suspect
48
49 even the unsophisticated reader) to adequately discern the authors' judgements about unit type
sharing by looking at spectrograms. The examples in the Figure 3 are tiny and presented in an
50
odd way (sort of like a gel?). Why is there not a figure that shows clear examples of song
51
sharing between places and years? If I cannot observe and evaluate at that level, then all the
52
bells and whistles that follow bring little to no weight to the paper's claims of song sharing
53
with such an tiny sample size. A similar component of any rewrite is that the paper needs to
54
unambiguously from the beginning and throughout clearly acknowledge the very, very
55
limited amount of acoustic data. Also, in the methods, there needs to be a clear an
56
unambiguous admission as to the limits of their feature measurement process, which by its

3 very nature blurs distinctions between song units such that it lumps at a rather gross level.
4
5 We have reanalysed the data as noted above.
6
7 The file I attach is the PDF version of the paper with my many comments. I do this rather
8 than write out a separate list. One of those needs to be repeated here and adequately addressed
9 in any rewite/resubmission.
10
11 On line 367 I comment: "You cannot say that these data represent song at the population level
12 with totals of 14 singers (Gabon ) and 16 singers (Madagascar) over a 5 year sampling period
13 (average recording 54.7 min SD 35 min Gabon, 87.3 min SD 38 min Madagascar). These data
14 represent song at the level of a few individuals whose songs were evaluated based on very
15 brief acoustic samples (Gabon 58 songs, ave 4.1 SD 2.8/singer; Madagascar 78 songs, ave 4.8
16 SD 2.1/singer). Placing these results within the proper data level is imperative. This is not a
17 population level acoustic comparison of song similarity. It was an attempt at that level, but
18 does not in any way pass the litmus test of a population level comparison. It points to and
19 perhaps suggests a possible population level interchange, but the acoustic analytics are
20 insufficient for this comparison because they are too subjective and the sample size is too
21 small.
22
23 We have reworded the manuscript more conservatively to reflect this point. E.g., see
24 L341, L363.
25
26 The figures for the results are insufficient and do not demonstrate an adequate comparative
27 level by which to conclude acoustic similarity. The features used in the comparative analysis
28 do not yield acoustic identities: that is, you cannot use these feature sets alone to regenerate
29 the sounds they represent. As a result, the feature measurement process intrinsically lumps
30 sounds together and is not well designed to enable adequate differentiation between different
31 unit types.
32
33 We have remedied this with the reanalysis noted above. We have also included a
34 table with unit sequences for each location/year/phrase type to allow comparison
35 (Table 2).
36 The discussion makes some very appropriate points and is pretty much on target. The
37 references are pretty thorough, but i did not cross check with text.

27 Figure 1. Map adapted from Rosenbaum et al. (2009) that illustrates sub-stock structure of breeding stocks
28 B & C in relation to the IWC’s Southern Ocean feeding ground management areas. Humpback whale songs
29 were recorded at three study sites, represented by the stars on the map. Samples from Iguela (green) and
30 Mayumba (blue), were presumably collected from individuals in the breeding sub-stock B1 (BSB1), but with
31 uncertainty regarding sub-stock boundaries we used the population level demarcation (BSB) when referring
to population. Samples representing breeding stock C (BSC), were sampled from sub-stock C3 (BSC3) in
32 Antongil Bay (red), Madagascar.

Comment 4: Since this term is critical to the text about “intra- and inter-
individual variability in song composition” it would be valuable to express the
working definition of “at any point in time.” Day? Week? Month?
o We changed the sentence to express a working definition of at
any point in time (breeding season)
o Please see lines 92-94
Comment 5: So “song sharing” is a generic term under which “song
similarity” is a subset? What’s the difference between “song sharing” and
“song similarity,” and why do you introduce these two different forms of
words? Can’t song sharing provide an understanding of connectivity etc.?
o We rephrased the objectives to better clarify that we used song
similarity measures to examine song sharing between these
populations
o Please see lines 136-140
Comment 6: actually not “from Africa” but from humpback populations that
occur off Africa
o Rephrased sentence to reflect the recordings were collected off
the African coast.
o Please see lines 141-142
Comment 7: So why not define what is meant by a “recording”? “Recording”
is very generic, but it sounds as if this term is used here to refer to a results
from a recording session during which song(s) samples was/were collected
from the same individual. So why not refer to and define a data recording
session product as an “acoustic sample” or something more distinctive than
just “recording”
o Defined recording as acoustic sample in response to this
comment.
o Please see lines 160-164
Comment 8: So the analysis reverts to using two techniques that are used
more for genetics than acoustics?
o These methods have been used for genetics, but have been
adapted, in some cases improved, and utilized for acoustic
studies (see Garland et al., 2012 and Garland et al., 2017)
Comment 9: Not clear about populations. Wasn’t song similarity calculated
among and across years? Here it’s not stated
o Clarified that we examine song similarity within and between
populations/years
o Please see lines 220-222
Comment 10: Why not more clearly state that the song analysis converted a
song unit into a specific lettered code such that a phrase type/theme is
represented as a string of lettered codes? This is the way you converted the
actual song phenomenon, which is an acoustic behavioral display, into a form
acceptable for Levenshtein analysis. One cannot reverse that process and end
up with actual song, so some level of acoustic information is lost in this
analytical process
o This is a valid comment and we have attempted to address this
issue of losing acoustic data during the coding process by
measuring all of the unit types present in the themes from each
singer across all populations/years. The quantitative measure of
similarity-difference of unit types was implemented following
Garland et al. (2017, JASA) to create a matrix of unit similarity
based on acoustic feature space. This was included in LSI
analyses as a weighting to remove subjective decisions about
same/different units within each song sequence string [coded
songs/themes].
o Please see lines 224-232
Comment 11: Comparison gives you more than just an “understanding of
sequence”, it provides an avenue by which to compare some relative level of
similarity/difference between songs at the thematic level, no?
o We revised the sentence to acknowledge this comment.
o Please see lines 224-226
Comment 12: Would be more appropriate to use “between” here since
individual singers are the unit of analysis, not populations? So this is
specifically either intra- or inter-singer, not both. Why not both?
o We changed sentence to reflect that the analysis incorporated
both intra- and inter-singer variability
o Please see lines 235-236
Comment 13: does this mean intra-singer similarity? Ambiguous, because
next sentence says both intra and inter
o The analysis examined both intra- and inter-singer similarity.
The first sentence was introducing the analysis while the
second sentence provided further detail about that analysis. We
feel that with the additional information clarifying inter- and
intra-singer similarity in the first sentence of the paragraph that
this does not require further clarification throughout.
o Please see lines 235-236
Comment 14: Not really true: given the process of converting a song into a
sequence of lettered representations of phrase types, it is a viable way of
taking into account…
o We revised the sentence to make it more general instead of a
definitive statement that all variability was accounted for.
o Please see lines 239-241
Comment 15: Could not find caption for Table S4
o We are sorry for this error. The Tables for the supplementary
figures were wrongly labeled and there is no Table S4. The
table captions have been corrected throughout the document.
Comment 16: Not really clear what exactly this means, but presume it refers
to the fact that does not include the lettered codes used to represent different
“median sequence of units making up each phrase type/theme per population
and year.” As shown in table 2?
o We revised the sentence to clarify the Dice’s analysis
examined all the phrase types sung by each individual and
compared this among singers/years without taking into account
the order to which phrases were sung within each song string.
o Please see lines 244-247
Comment 17: Sentence seems odd: “bootstrapping was both multi-scale
bootstrap resampling” does not seem like a proper sentence
o We revised this sentence for clarity ‘Bootstrapping was done
using both multi-scale resampling (AU; significant if p > 95%)
and normal probability (BP; significant if p > 70%)’
o Please see lines 260-261
Comment 18: So looking at figure 2 and the results for the two types of
comparative analysis (Lev and Dice), it becomes very obvious that the results
depend very much on the conversion of the acoustic phenomenon into coded
sequences of letters
o Please see response to comment 10 above. We do not feel that
this statement requires further revisions in the manuscript.
Comment 19: This section with references to acoustic entities such as cry-
woop, trumpet, or yap don’t mean anything. As such where does one at least
find the actual spectrographic exemplars of these terms? Table S2 provides a
verbal, English description of the code, but other than Fig 2, there are no data
provided to illustrate the variation is the acoustic form for any of these coded
terms
o To address this comment, we have added unit information to
Figure 2
Comment 20: But who has tried this same analytical approach?
o Other papers have utilized the same analytical approach
including Garland et al., 2012 and Garland et al., 2017 for
humpback song in other populations.
Comment 21: Song divergence did not reduce song similarity. These are both
terms referring to basically the same thing. This paper does not resolve the
question of why song similarity/divergence fluctuates between these two
populations. Rather, it shows that there is variation in the level of song
similarity/divergence fluctuates between these two populations
o We clarified this sentence to better reflect that variation in song
similarity/divergence was observed in 2002
o Please see lines 417-419
Comment 22: “song analysis is limited to mature males… “ this is not known
to be true, unless one adopts a circular definition of mature male so as to
require that he sing. Non-breeding (“immature”) males could sing as is
common in other taxa
o We revised this sentence to clarify that humpback whale song
analysis is limited to males and have removed the reference to
mature males
o Please see lines 440-441
Comment 23: Rather than making this “fine-scale” statement, since such is in
the eye of the beholder, why not qualify this subjective opinion
o We have revised the sentence to remove this subjective
statement and to better reflect the overall significance of this
study.
o Please see lines 443-446
