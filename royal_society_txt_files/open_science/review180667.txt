Review of the article entitled “Microplastic ingestion in six of the deepest marine ecosystems on
Earth”
The present study investigated the presence of microplastics in amphipod sampled in six deep-
sea ecosystem. The authors extracted the microplastic from organisms with a digestion protocol
then they took pictures of the microplastics and concluded that microplastics are present and
ingested by amphipods at the deepest location of all the world’s ocean.
Overall comments
This article is potentially interesting and timely. The data collected from an unexplored area of
Pacific Ocean are of high scientific relevance. However, there are some major issues that prevent
the acceptance of the manuscript in the present form and need to be addressed:
1. the study refers to “microplastic”, but lacks of analytical (chemical or spectroscopic) analysis,
which is absolutely necessary to confirm that the filaments they found are made of plastic and not
of other materials (as often the case when made of cellulose or rayon or viscose). The fibres and
fragments were indeed identified in terms of colour and shape from the material extracted from
the animal.
2. the manuscript needs to be carefully revised / supported for some definitions/assumptions as
some of them could have important scientific implications :
- microplastic: the authors only specify the upper limit (=5 mm)
- refs for the ingestion of microplastic by other marine organisms such as deep-sea fish and
invertebrate (e.g., polychaetes)
- you take 3000 m as the maximum depth reached by the bathyal zone but this could be 4000 m
depending on the definitions
- refs for the different mechanisms of microplastic export to deep sea (e.g marine snow and
biofouling)
3. The results are not clearly illustrated. The histogram in Figure 4c is not clear and intuitive. The
percentage relative to the amphipods is not represented and apparently comes from the blue. I
would recommend to include an additional figure illustrating the different percentages of the
different fibres and fragments to be consistent with the discussion.
Concluding, I think that this article needs a throughout revision, including an in depth analysis of
the plastic to confirm the results presented, and should provide a clear presentation of the results
obtained before being considered for publication.

Dear Authors,
4
Thank you for presenting an interesting study. Investigating the interaction of deep-benthic
organisms with microplastics has a great significance as the deep-sea has been highlighted as the
eventual sink for microplastics.
I have found areas within the manuscript that should be addressed and i feel these changes will
greatly improve the study. I have also taken time to critically look at the references included and
have suggested some changes.

microplastics. As recent research has highlighted, visual identification is not recommended on its
own, and it needs to be supported by further techniques. I urged the authors to address this
significant error. I am highly opposed to publishing anything that does not even attempt to
confirm the authors "visual " identification skills. A subset 10% of potential particles would
improve interpretation of visual analysis greatly.

Review: RSOS-172333
Microfibre ingestion in size of the deepest marine ecosystems on earth
Dear Authors,
Thank you for producing this manuscript. You have investigated the presence of
microfibres/particles ingestion by amphipods in the deep sea. This information is timely and
provides a new insight into deep sea contamination. The introduction is well references, although
some references can be updated. The object of the study is clearly stated. I am concerned about
the number of individuals per site, although I do understand the difficulties in collecting
specimens from such depth. I would urge the authors to therefore reduce the speculation of site
differences in the results due to the low number of individuals. There are two few specimens per
sites to carry out sufficient statistical analysis. I lack size descriptions of particles identified.
Please include more discussion on other papers looking at deep sea organisms. The discussion
has a large text on toxicological effects, I feel too much weight is given here, considering the
study does not focus on toxicity. I would like to see more information on the effect of KOH, and
how the sites are not comparable. Please expand.
Specific comments (line numbers supplied by authors)
Title: update to be microplastics or microparticles to truly reflect the results
Introduction
Line 30: please update this value, 322 was the latest value from Plastic Europe in 2015.
Line 30: litters is a very colloquial term, I would suggest the authors state occurs/is present.
Line 57: by definition fibres are not primary microplastics, they are produced through the
breakdown. I would also advise the authors to avoid terminology such as primary and secondary
11
microplastics. There are three types of microplastics. Those that are produced for use in the
microscale, those that breakdown during use, and those that breakdown after use/once they are
environmental contaminants.
Line 57: reference 18 is not needed here.
Methods
Line 107: 10 individuals per site is very low for replicates. I would therefore highlight that any
differences between sites cannot be classed as significant. Further replicates are needed.
Line 108: remove baited. (is repeated in 109, so not needed twice)
Line 110: Change to … could affect “further study.”
Line 113: Question: do the authors know how fast digestion is in this species, could digestion
happen during capture? I would like to see some discussion around this point.
Line 118: Question: Are the authors aware of any previous research that shows the % of ethanol
that affects plastic?
Line 141: why was only 15 particles subjected to FTIR? Does this follow MSFD and NOAA that
recommend 10% of overall subsample based on size?
Line 149: Why were both transmittance and reflectance used? They can provide different results,
ATR is better at distinguishing between semi- cellulosic particle.
Results
Line 155: fibres AND fragments
Line 165: 122 items in total. Were all particles plastics/semi-synthetic, how many were rejected
based on the FTIR results?
Line 176: ramie, correct spelling please
Line 181: Please discuss the potential effect of KOH on particles.
Discussion
Line 188: please include other papers on deep water organisms. Taylor etc.
Line 193-195: Due to the date differences, are the samples comparable? I lack discussion here.
Line 214-218: this study does not show these. I suggest the authors make it clear
Conclusion
Lin 233: here you have used world’s whereas earlier in the document you have sued World’s.
Please be consistant
Line 235:which factors? Please include,. Would like to see these factos discussed in more details
in the discussion.
Line 236-237 should be removed as no a key result from this study
Line 238: This study does not show plastics are culminating and accumulating. Should not be a
conclusion.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
The manuscript presents observations of microplastics from amphipods sampled from hadal
depths. It covers six locations across the general Pacific region. From the observations authors
conclude ‘it is likely that all marine ecosystems … have been impacted by anthropogenic debris’.
I suggest that the authors did not require their new data to make this conclusion, therefore need
to reconsider what their data bring to the crowded field of microplastics research.
Specific comments follow
Abstract
Line 13-14 untrue- Ubiquity has been shown across geography and depths. Agreed not the
depths presented in this paper, how everywhere microplastics have been looked for they have
been found. Suggest rephrasing this statement.
Line 22 Plastic polymer names should be given in full instead of the abbreviations
Line 25-26, this is not new and the data in this paper are not required for this hypothesis- see
main comment
Keywords
Spelling ‘microfiber’
Introduction
Line 36-41- Suggest removing, not relevant to the paper
Line 53- See Koelman et al 2016 and Bakir et al 2016 for discussion on this. It is not as certain as
authors suggest. It is important to qualify this statement such as ‘Plastic could act as vectors…’
Koelmans, A. A., Bakir, A., Burton, G. A., & Janssen, C. R. (2016). Microplastic as a vector for
chemicals in the aquatic environment: critical review and model-supported reinterpretation of
empirical studies. Environmental science & technology, 50(7), 3315-3326.
Bakir, A., O'Connor, I. A., Rowland, S. J., Hendriks, A. J., & Thompson, R. C. (2016). Relative
importance of microplastics as a pathway for the transfer of hydrophobic organic chemicals to
marine life. Environmental pollution, 219, 56-65.
Line 55 ref 16 is a review and does not support this statement in fact it states ‘Hydrophobic
contaminants are enriched on microplastics, but the available experimental results and modelling
approaches indicate that the transfer of sorbed pollutants by microplastics is not likely to
contribute significantly to bioaccumulation of these pollutants.’
Line 63-Might be useful to add in this sentence that the negative impacts documented to date are
those from physical mechanisms of the microplastics, as these are the impacts listed.
Line 72- Fischer et al already show microplastics in hadal sediments. Why is it not appropriate to
extrapolate plastic presence to greater depth and organism ingestion to those inhabiting those
depths? The mechanisms for microplastic sinking given in the papers cited, continue through the
depths of the ocean.
Methods
Line 118- Was the container cleaned?
Line 123- What was lab coat made from? Where there any other controls about clothing worn in
the lab and during sample collection?
Results
Line 175-181 Suggest deleting. Not sure in the value of suggesting which products the
microplastics could have come from. Polymers are used over a vast range of products and it is
13
not possible to track microplastics to a source. Maybe a simple statement that says a wide varied
of polymers were observed and therefore they likely come from a wide variety of products.
Discussion
An important point for the discussion is that light microscope screening into categories does not
work, as stated lines 172-173.
Line 196- Suggest deleting as the crude sorting process was not confirmed with FTIR. Therefore
discussion results based on a classification they disprove is not useful. In addition I am unsure
how useful it is to compare between studies just using plastic colour as they could have been of
any material seen or unseen in the new data set.
Line 209 - See comments associated with line 53. You really need to state that most lab studies use
concentrations and models that are not representative in the wild see review by Galloway et al
(2017) for discussion.
Galloway, T. S., Cole, M., & Lewis, C. (2017). Interactions of microplastic debris throughout the
marine ecosystem. Nature ecology & evolution, 1(5), 0116.
Line 222 Trophic transfer conclusions are based on lab studies using very high concentrations.
Therefore the discussion needs to reflect this.
Conclusion
Line 235- Due to limited sampling not sure it is an appropriate to conclude higher ingestion rate
in the Mariana Trench.
Line 236 Suggest amending this sentence. Physical impacts have been shown not chemical ones.
Ref 39 does not support this statement.

Dear Dr Jamieson:
Manuscript ID RSOS-172333 entitled "Microfibre ingestion in six of the deepest marine
ecosystems on Earth" which you submitted to Royal Society Open Science, has been reviewed.
The comments from reviewer(s) are included at the bottom of this letter.
In view of the criticisms of the reviewer(s), I must decline the manuscript for publication in Royal
Society Open Science at this time. However, a new manuscript may be submitted which takes
into consideration these comments. I note that this is already a resubmission and that many of the
original issues regarding your manuscript have not been satisfactorily addressed. Specifically,
these include a tendency to over-hype the new data, in terms of their novelty and significance
and, related, a failure to fully cite other, recent pertinent literature. That said, I find your
manuscript to be an important addition to a growing body of evidence for the pernicious
influence of plastics into the deepest parts of the ocean ecosystem. However, for your manuscript
to be published in RSOS, it is essential to recognise the limitations of your work (sample size,
habitat, etc) and not over-egg its significance. This is what reviewers have consistently and
reasonably sought, but I feel you have failed to do. In inviting you to resubmit I am offering
another chance to make the required changes and then face further review. If you are unwilling
14
(or unable) to make such changes then it may be that your work is better suited to another
journal.
Please note that resubmitting your manuscript does not guarantee eventual acceptance, and that
your resubmission will be subject to re-review by the reviewer(s) before a decision is rendered.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of your
manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript using a word processing program and save it on

Microfibre ingestion in size of the deepest marine ecosystems on earth
Dear Authors,
Thank you for producing this manuscript. You have investigated the presence of
microfibres/particles ingestion by amphipods in the deep sea. This information is timely and
provides a new insight into deep sea contamination. The introduction is well references, although
some references can be updated. The object of the study is clearly stated. I am concerned about
the number of individuals per site, although I do understand the difficulties in collecting
specimens from such depth. I would urge the authors to therefore reduce the speculation of site
differences in the results due to the low number of individuals. There are two few specimens per
sites to carry out sufficient statistical analysis. I lack size descriptions of particles identified.
Please include more discussion on other papers looking at deep sea organisms. The discussion
has a large text on toxicological effects, I feel too much weight is given here, considering the
study does not focus on toxicity. I would like to see more information on the effect of KOH, and
how the sites are not comparable. Please expand.
Specific comments (line numbers supplied by authors)
Title: update to be microplastics or microparticles to truly reflect the results
Introduction
Line 30: please update this value, 322 was the latest value from Plastic Europe in 2015.
Line 30: litters is a very colloquial term, I would suggest the authors state occurs/is present.
Line 57: by definition fibres are not primary microplastics, they are produced through the
breakdown. I would also advise the authors to avoid terminology such as primary and secondary
microplastics. There are three types of microplastics. Those that are produced for use in the
microscale, those that breakdown during use, and those that breakdown after use/once they are
environmental contaminants.
Line 57: reference 18 is not needed here.
Methods
Line 107: 10 individuals per site is very low for replicates. I would therefore highlight that any
differences between sites cannot be classed as significant. Further replicates are needed.
Line 108: remove baited. (is repeated in 109, so not needed twice)
Line 110: Change to … could affect “further study.”
Line 113: Question: do the authors know how fast digestion is in this species, could digestion
happen during capture? I would like to see some discussion around this point.
Line 118: Question: Are the authors aware of any previous research that shows the % of ethanol
that affects plastic?
Line 141: why was only 15 particles subjected to FTIR? Does this follow MSFD and NOAA that
recommend 10% of overall subsample based on size?
Line 149: Why were both transmittance and reflectance used? They can provide different results,
ATR is better at distinguishing between semi- cellulosic particle.
Results
Line 155: fibres AND fragments
Line 165: 122 items in total. Were all particles plastics/semi-synthetic, how many were rejected
based on the FTIR results?
Line 176: ramie, correct spelling please
16
Line 181: Please discuss the potential effect of KOH on particles.
Discussion
Line 188: please include other papers on deep water organisms. Taylor etc.
Line 193-195: Due to the date differences, are the samples comparable? I lack discussion here.
Line 214-218: this study does not show these. I suggest the authors make it clear
Conclusion
Lin 233: here you have used world’s whereas earlier in the document you have sued World’s.
Please be consistant
Line 235:which factors? Please include,. Would like to see these factos discussed in more details
in the discussion.
Line 236-237 should be removed as no a key result from this study
Line 238: This study does not show plastics are culminating and accumulating. Should not be a
conclusion.
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript presents observations of microplastics from amphipods sampled from hadal
depths. It covers six locations across the general Pacific region. From the observations authors
conclude ‘it is likely that all marine ecosystems … have been impacted by anthropogenic debris’.
I suggest that the authors did not require their new data to make this conclusion, therefore need
to reconsider what their data bring to the crowded field of microplastics research.
Specific comments follow
Abstract
Line 13-14 untrue- Ubiquity has been shown across geography and depths. Agreed not the
depths presented in this paper, how everywhere microplastics have been looked for they have
been found. Suggest rephrasing this statement.
Line 22 Plastic polymer names should be given in full instead of the abbreviations
Line 25-26, this is not new and the data in this paper are not required for this hypothesis- see
main comment
Keywords
Spelling ‘microfiber’
Introduction
Line 36-41- Suggest removing, not relevant to the paper
Line 53- See Koelman et al 2016 and Bakir et al 2016 for discussion on this. It is not as certain as
authors suggest. It is important to qualify this statement such as ‘Plastic could act as vectors…’
Koelmans, A. A., Bakir, A., Burton, G. A., & Janssen, C. R. (2016). Microplastic as a vector for
chemicals in the aquatic environment: critical review and model-supported reinterpretation of
empirical studies. Environmental science & technology, 50(7), 3315-3326.
Bakir, A., O'Connor, I. A., Rowland, S. J., Hendriks, A. J., & Thompson, R. C. (2016). Relative
importance of microplastics as a pathway for the transfer of hydrophobic organic chemicals to
marine life. Environmental pollution, 219, 56-65.
Line 55 ref 16 is a review and does not support this statement in fact it states ‘Hydrophobic
contaminants are enriched on microplastics, but the available experimental results and modelling
approaches indicate that the transfer of sorbed pollutants by microplastics is not likely to
contribute significantly to bioaccumulation of these pollutants.’
Line 63-Might be useful to add in this sentence that the negative impacts documented to date are
those from physical mechanisms of the microplastics, as these are the impacts listed.
Line 72- Fischer et al already show microplastics in hadal sediments. Why is it not appropriate to
extrapolate plastic presence to greater depth and organism ingestion to those inhabiting those
depths? The mechanisms for microplastic sinking given in the papers cited, continue through the
depths of the ocean.
17
Methods
Line 118- Was the container cleaned?
Line 123- What was lab coat made from? Where there any other controls about clothing worn in
the lab and during sample collection?
Results
Line 175-181 Suggest deleting. Not sure in the value of suggesting which products the
microplastics could have come from. Polymers are used over a vast range of products and it is
not possible to track microplastics to a source. Maybe a simple statement that says a wide varied
of polymers were observed and therefore they likely come from a wide variety of products.
Discussion
An important point for the discussion is that light microscope screening into categories does not
work, as stated lines 172-173.
Line 196- Suggest deleting as the crude sorting process was not confirmed with FTIR. Therefore
discussion results based on a classification they disprove is not useful. In addition I am unsure
how useful it is to compare between studies just using plastic colour as they could have been of
any material seen or unseen in the new data set.
Line 209 - See comments associated with line 53. You really need to state that most lab studies use
concentrations and models that are not representative in the wild see review by Galloway et al
(2017) for discussion.
Galloway, T. S., Cole, M., & Lewis, C. (2017). Interactions of microplastic debris throughout the
marine ecosystem. Nature ecology & evolution, 1(5), 0116.
Line 222 Trophic transfer conclusions are based on lab studies using very high concentrations.
Therefore the discussion needs to reflect this.
Conclusion
Line 235- Due to limited sampling not sure it is an appropriate to conclude higher ingestion rate
in the Mariana Trench.
Line 236 Suggest amending this sentence. Physical impacts have been shown not chemical ones.
Ref 39 does not support this statement.
Line 242 This is not a new conclusion see ref 7 cited in this manuscript

The authors generally did a good job in amending the ms and provided a convincing response to
all queries, as detailed here below:
1. Number of individual per site and statistical analysis: The authors justified the reason for the
reduced number of samples. The study focuses more on the presence or absence of microplastic
in organisms. FT-IR analysis have been added clarified in the text.
2. Comparability of the sites: the authors have answered in a comprehensive manner, limiting
themselves to highlighting the individual results in the different sites, specifying that they do not
know what the phenomena responsible for these different accumulations could be.
3. Include more discussion on other studies looking at deep-sea organisms: the authors did not
include Choy et al. 2013
4. Discussion on toxicological effects: this part of the discussion has been omitted in the amended
removed
5. Effects of potassium hydroxide (KOH): the authors have have included more detailed
information on the treatment with KOH and added a reference that explains more about the
treatment
Specific comments: all the comments have been taken into consideration by the authors, except
for the line 113 where authors express the impossibility to test how fast the digestion is in the
different species.
I'm happy with the present version and I recommend its publication as it is

Thank you for addressing my previous concerns. I have a few more minor comments
In your responce to:Introduction Line 30: please update this value, 322 was the latest value from
Plastic Europe in 2015.
You stated that: We were unable to find this value on Plastic Europe website. In light of this, we
will stick with the value in Erickson et al. 2014 (10.1371/journal.pone.0111913) rather than placing
in an unreferenced source.
Using data from three years ago is inappropriate. Here is the reference. See page 16. All scientific
research has presented this data from earlier years, I see no reason why the authors
cannot/refuse to use this data
https://www.plasticseurope.org/en/resources/publications/274-plastics-facts-2017
I reiterate that 10 individuals per site is not an appropriate number, there is reference in the
literature that 20-50 individuals are required to give a good description of contamination loads.
Especially in areas as remote as the trenches. I highly urge the authors to increase the numbers of
individuals at each site, especially when they say there are more individuals to use for analysis.
This will have a better impact on the research community and will not be looked at as “another”
presence and absence paper.
Line 113: Question: do the authors know how fast digestion is in this species, could digestion
happen during capture? I would like to see some discussion around this point.
Response: We do not know how fast digestion is in these species. Feeding studies are extremely
difficult in hadal species because the amphipods arrive dead on deck as a result of decompression
mortality.
I thank the authors for this response. Such discussion would be useful in the document. Digestion
times are highlighted in coastal studies, and even staytong the ansers are not clear but furture
research would be needed would be suffice for the discussion.

Review of the article “Microplastic and synthetic particles ingested by deep-sea amphipods in six
of the deepest marine ecosystems on Earth”
Reviewer: 1
The authors did a good job in amending the ms and provided a convincing response to all
queries, except for the line 113 where authors declared the impossibility to test how fast the
digestion is in the different species. I think there are some data available and the authors should
make a further effort in this direction. The other minor issues have been answered in a
comprehensive manner. Overall, however, I'm happy with the present version and I recommend
its publication after this minor change.

Appendix A
Reviewer: 1
1. the study refers to “microplastic”, but lacks of analytical (chemical or spectroscopic)
analysis, which is absolutely necessary to confirm that the filaments they found are
made of plastic and not of other materials (as often the case when made of cellulose or
rayon or viscose). The fibres and fragments were indeed identified in terms of colour
and shape from the material extracted from the animal.
RESPONSE: We very much take the point here of reviewer #1 (and #2) and so we took
a sub sample of the fibres to a state of the art FTIR analysis facility at Shimadzu UK Ltd
in Milton Keynes. We now have established that the fibres are a mix of synthetic
polymer, semi-synthetic fibres and a few natural fibres, mostly mused in textiles etc.
We have therefore been careful with the use of the word ‘microplastic’ as this does not
always cover the range of fibres found, thus we have changed throughout, where
appropriate, the terminologies of microplastic and microfibre, regardless the point
remains that these were all found to be anthropogenic following the expertise analysis
requested by the reviewers.
In the MS we have added:
In the Methods:
A subsample of fibres (n=15) spanning all trenches were analysed by Fourier-
Transform Infra-red Spectrophotometer (FTIR; IR Tracer-100, Shimadzu, Japan)
connected to an automatic infrared microscope (AIM-9000, Shimadzu, Japan) at the
Shimadzu UK Ltd Laboratory Facility in Milton Keynes. Individual fibres were manually
removed and transferred to the surface of FTIR reflective slides (Kevley Technologies,
Ohio) (which provide a suitable background for reflectance) or transferred to a Specac
DC3 Diamond Cell and compressed for transmission measurements (with background
scans being taken through the diamond adjacent to the sample). The fibre was
observed using the wide field camera to identify possible locations for further
investigation, and the measurements were made in transmittance or reflectance mode
(50 scans over approx. 20 s) using the Wide-Band MCT (mercury cadmium telluride)
detector. For each fibre, three points were scanned and the results were compared to
those in the Shimadzu materials library for matches or closest similarity. Some of the
fibres which showed unusual structure were scanned in several places to reveal more
about their chemical composition.
In the results:
Six of the 15 items analysed using FTIR were semi-synthetic cellulosic fibres, rayon and
lyocell, the natural fibre ramie that are used in products such as textiles. Rayon is also
used on absorbent hygiene products, and ramie is used in sewing threads, packing
materials, fishing nets and filters. The rest included synthetic polymers such as Nylon,
polyethylene (PE), polyamide (PA), or unidentified polyvinyls closely resembling
polyvinyl alcohol (PVAL) and with most including an inorganic filler material. One fibre
found in the Peru-Chile Trench at 7050m was clearly a polyethylene coated strand of
polyester, possible representing fishing line. None of the 15 subsamples were found to
be naturally occurring.
ALL FTIR data is shown in Table 2.
2. the manuscript needs to be carefully revised / supported for some
definitions/assumptions as some of them could have important scientific implications :
- microplastic: the authors only specify the upper limit (=5 mm)
RESPONSE: Added that the lower limit is 3333um and cited Desforges, J.P.W.,
Galbraith, M., Dangerfield, N. and Ross, P.S., 2014. Widespread distribution of
microplastics in subsurface seawater in the NE Pacific Ocean. Marine pollution bulletin,
79(1), pp.94-99.
- refs for the ingestion of microplastic by other marine organisms such as deep-sea fish
and invertebrate (e.g., polychaetes)
- you take 3000 m as the maximum depth reached by the bathyal zone but this could
be 4000 m depending on the definitions
RESPONSE: This really isn’t the paper to redefine the world’s biozones, some say
3000m and some say 4000m for the bathyal-abyssal boundary. We have therefore
changed the sentence to read “…limited to depth ‘within’ the bathyal zone (<30000
m)…
2. The results are not clearly illustrated. The histogram in Figure 4c is not clear and
intuitive. The percentage relative to the amphipods is not represented and apparently
comes from the blue. I would recommend to include an additional figure illustrating the
different percentages of the different fibres and fragments to be consistent with the
discussion.
RESPONSE: this exact graph has been added as Figure 4D

Methods
-The methods used are sound as written but present a significant flaw in this research.
There is no confirmation of the visually identified plastics. As it stands this study
presents POTENTIAL microplastics. As recent research has highlighted, visual
identification is not recommended on its own, and it needs to be supported by further
techniques. I urged the authors to address this significant error. I am highly opposed to
publishing anything that does not even attempt to confirm the authors "visual "
identification skills. A subset 10% of potential particles would improve interpretation of
visual analysis greatly.

contamination, this section would also be greatly supported by inclusion of chemical
analysis of potential microplastics. For example, If Nylon is identified, then the authors
could infer possible sources.
RESPONSE: We believe this to be beyond the scope of the study. This study is
identifying the fact that the fibres exist within organisms at these depths. Any detailing
of how they got there beyond ‘sinking’ would be pure conjecture. We believe that a
larger follow-on study looking into sources would indeed be very interesting but the
real mechanism, sources, timescales involved are really beyond the scope of this initial
study.
Line 186: i am not convinced that POPs and associated chemicals to plastics are
relevant to this manuscript as the authors do not study the effects, its inclusion would
be relevant if better introduced. I feel that more discussion on sources and routes of
MPs to the deep sea sediment is more important.
RESPONSE: see comment above. Transport and mechanisms are pure speculation but it
is actually known that POPs aggregate to plastics and thus the presence of plastics with
increase POP contamination, which, as explained in the paper, correlates to the findings
of Jamieson et al 2017, Nature Ecol. Evol.

Review: RSOS-172333
Microfibre ingestion in size of the deepest marine ecosystems on earth
Dear Authors,
Thank you for producing this manuscript. You have investigated the
presence of microfibres/particles ingestion by amphipods in the deep sea.
This information is timely and provides a new insight into deep sea
contamination. The introduction is well references, although some
references can be updated. The object of the study is clearly stated. I am
concerned about the number of individuals per site, although I do
understand the difficulties in collecting specimens from such depth. I would
urge the authors to therefore reduce the speculation of site differences in
the results due to the low number of individuals. There are two few
specimens per sites to carry out sufficient statistical analysis. I lack size
descriptions of particles identified. Please include more discussion on other
papers looking at deep sea organisms. The discussion has a large text on
toxicological effects, I feel too much weight is given here, considering the
study does not focus on toxicity. I would like to see more information on the
effect of KOH, and how the sites are not comparable. Please expand.
Response:
The reviewer has highlighted a number of points of concern. We address
some of the reviewers concerns below and within the specific comments
listed.
1. Number of individual per site and statistical analysis.
It is not clear if the statements are relating to the lack of statistical analysis
and perceived low sample size are criticisms of the manuscript which the
reviewer wishes us to address. There is no guidance regarding what the
reviewer feels is an appropriate sample size or how an appropriate sample
size might be calculated. This makes the comment very difficult to address.
In many cases just increasing the sample size of study does not provide any
benefit. If we took 10 samples and found no particles then there is a
justification to ask for an increased sample size because if they were in very
low levels within the population we may have missed them. However, we
have found microparticles in 50% to 100% of the individuals (depending on
the trench) subsampled at random from a larger population. A subsample of
these were subjected to FTIR and were identified as microplastics. When
the question is focused around whether something is essentially present or
absent and it is found to be present, there is no need to increase the sample
size.
The reviewer has highlighted that the comparisons among the sites is a
potential problem with the manuscript but we have merely presented the
results as means, standard errors and percentages and described what we
have found, which is standard practice. The only statistical analysis that has
been carried out is the relationship between microparticles and depth in the
Kermadec Trench. 10 individuals for a statistical test based on means or
ranks is an ample sample size depending on the effect size you are looking
to detect. Given that the samples were chosen randomly from a greater
number of individuals collected from the site, the prevalence and mean
items were the same at all depths and the relationship was not significant,
there is no need to increase the sample size.
2. Comparability of the sites
We have not undertaken statistical analysis comparing the number of
microparticles among the trenches. This is because we feel time is a
confounding factor in the analysis. We cannot say whether differences
among trenches are a real phenomenon related to some mechanism that
results in plastics being transported to the deep sea because differences
may be purely related to accumulation over time. The trenches have been
sampled between 2008 and 2017. We have no temporal data in order to
understand accumulation rates and adjust for it in an analysis. However,
these data serve as a valuable baseline assessment from which we can
understand future microplastic ingestion in amphipods in hadal trenches
and whether it is increasing.
3. Include more discussion on other studies looking at deep-sea organisms
There are very few studies that look at the ingestion of the microplastics in
deep-sea organisms. In doing a Web of Knowledge search using the search
string “microplastic*” AND “ingest*” AND “deep sea”, only 8 papers appear.
Of these only two examine whether microplastics have been ingested by
deep-sea organisms deeper than 1000 m. These are Taylor et al 2016
(10.1038/srep33997) and Courtene-Jones et al. 2017
(10.1016/j.envpol.2017.08.026). There are two other papers which examine
vertically migrating fish by Choy et al 2013 (10.3354/meps10342) and
Lusher et al 2015 (10.1093/icesjms/fsv241) but these papers only go to a
depth of 500m. Lusher et al. (2015) only used visual methods to identify
microplastics. There really is very little information out there on this topic to
discuss. We have added some additional text in the discussion which
includes these studies in a bit more detail.
4. Discussion on toxicological effects.
We have removed this from the discussion.
5. Effects of potassium hydroxide (KOH)
This paper is not designed to look at the effects of KOH on sample
preparation. We do not have any data in order to discuss it. We have cited a
recent paper, which examined whether KOH was an appropriate solution to
dissolve organic material for microplastic research and they concluded that
using a 10% solution of KOH was an appropriate method. We have
commented further on this in relation to one of the “specific comments”.
Specific comments (line numbers supplied by authors)
Title: update to be microplastics or microparticles to truly reflect the results
Response: We have changed the title to “Microplastic and synthetic
particles” as this reflects both the plastic ingestion and the man-made fibres
that were ingested by the amphipods.
Introduction
Line 30: please update this value, 322 was the latest value from Plastic
Europe in 2015.
Response: We were unable to find this value on Plastic Europe website. In
light of this, we will stick with the value in Erickson et al. 2014
(10.1371/journal.pone.0111913) rather than placing in an unreferenced
source.
Line 30: litters is a very colloquial term, I would suggest the authors state
occurs/is present.
Response: We have altered the sentence to “… of plastic is now present in
the oceans,…”
Line 57: by definition fibres are not primary microplastics, they are
produced through the breakdown. I would also advise the authors to avoid
terminology such as primary and secondary microplastics. There are three
types of microplastics. Those that are produced for use in the microscale,
those that breakdown during use, and those that breakdown after use/once
they are environmental contaminants.
Response: We have updated lines 55 to 58 and “primary” and “secondary”
has been removed.
Line 57: reference 18 is not needed here.
Response: Reference 18 has been removed.
Methods
Line 107: 10 individuals per site is very low for replicates. I would therefore
highlight that any differences between sites cannot be classed as significant.
Further replicates are needed.
Response: We have not undertaken a statistical test to compare among
locations because the analysis would be confounded by time. Therefore, we
have not made any inference about whether locations are significantly
different in the statistical sense. We took 10 individuals per site and found
that between 50% and 100% of them contained microparticles. FTIR
identified some of these as plastic. Therefore, we have answered the
objective of the paper. There is no discussion about why one area has
higher instances of ingestion and no statistical analysis comparing the
trenches so the reviewers comment is not applicable.
Line 108: remove baited. (is repeated in 109, so not needed twice)
Response: “baited” removed from line 108
Line 110: Change to … could affect “further study.”
Response: We have removed “such as this study.”
Line 113: Question: do the authors know how fast digestion is in this
species, could digestion happen during capture? I would like to see some
discussion around this point.
Response: We do not know how fast digestion is in these species. Feeding
studies are extremely difficult in hadal species because the amphipods
arrive dead on deck as a result of decompression mortality.
Line 118: Question: Are the authors aware of any previous research that
shows the % of ethanol that affects plastic?
Response: We have already cited Courtene-Jones et al (2017, doi
10.1039/C6AY02343F) in the next line which states that ethanol does not
appear to significantly impact or degrade microplastics.
Line 141: why was only 15 particles subjected to FTIR? Does this follow
MSFD and NOAA that recommend 10% of overall subsample based on size?
Response: There were 122 microparticles observed in the study and we
subjected 15 of them to FTIR. This means we analysed 12% of the particles
found on the filter papers, which exceeded the request of a reviewer for the
previous submission and are in line with the MSFD guidelines. The FTIR has
shown that some of these items ingested by the hadal amphipods are
microplastics, which is the salient point of the manuscript. This is the first
record of microplastic ingestion in the hadal environment.
Line 149: Why were both transmittance and reflectance used? They can
provide different results, ATR is better at distinguishing between semi-
cellulosic particle.
Response: The fibres were analysed by transmittance and reflectance but
we found that transmittance gave the most reliable results. We’ve corrected
the methods section to say that all fibres were analysed by transmittance to
avoid any confusion. ATR was not used as the samples were of variable
morphological characteristics and in most cases unsuitable for ATR as direct
contact can deform or move the sample. The samples would have had to be
transferred to a hard crystal for measurement and transmission gives better
results in most cases when using the AIM-9000. The AIM-9000 gives very
high quality results in transmission and reflective modes, which would have
previously needed ATR.

Line 155: fibres AND fragments
Response: The text has been altered to “fibres and fragments”.
Line 165: 122 items in total. Were all particles plastics/semi-synthetic, how
many were rejected based on the FTIR results?
Response: As stated in the methods, there were 15 items out of 122
analysed by FTIR chosen at random from a subset of amphipods that
contained the various types of microparticles. The analytical summary and
correspondence provided by the laboratory indicated that they were happy
with the identifications of the 15 particles analysed.
Line 176: ramie, correct spelling please
Response: ramie is spelt correctly on line 176.
Line 181: Please discuss the potential effect of KOH on particles.
Response: It does not seem appropriate to discuss the potential effect of
KOH on particles in the results section. The study did not look at the effects
of KOH on the different types of plastics. There are no results to report and
therefore discuss. We have placed the following sentence in the methods
section which supports the use of KOH along with an accompanying
reference:
“KOH has been shown to be a suitable solution to dissolve the guts of
marine fauna, leaving the majority of microplastics unaffected (Kühn et al
2017; 10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.11.034)”
Discussion
Line 188: please include other papers on deep water organisms. Taylor etc.
Response: The statement is making a comparison to coastal water habitats
not other deep-sea habitats. Therefore, it is not appropriate to cite Taylor et
al 2016 (10.1038/srep33997) with this statement. Reference to this paper
and other papers focusing on deep-sea habitats are made in appropriate
places throughout the text.
Line 193-195: Due to the date differences, are the samples comparable? I
lack discussion here.
Response: The differences in sampling dates mean that time is a
confounding factor in the analysis. We have analysed whether there are
differences in microparticle numbers ingested among depths in the
Kermadec Trench as these samples were taken within a short time window.
It is difficult to draw any conclusions about why amphipods in one trench
have higher numbers of ingested microparticles when there is a 9 year
difference in sampling. The difference could be the result of greater time in
which plastics have accumulated in the area rather than any differences in
the way plastics accumulate in the area or the mechanism by which plastics
reach the seafloor. We have added some text to the discussion related this
point.
Line 214-218: this study does not show these. I suggest the authors make it
clear
Response: We have removed the section on potential links between plastic
and persistent organic pollutants.
Conclusion
Line 233: here you have used world’s whereas earlier in the document you
have sued World’s. Please be consistant.
Response: This was a typing error. We have changed the all of the “world’s”
to “Earth’s” so it consistent with the title.
Line 235:which factors? Please include,. Would like to see these factos
discussed in more details in the discussion.
Response: We have added some additional text to the discussion which
states some of the factors by which plastics can enter the deep sea. These
appear between lines 210 and 214 of the new submission. We have
removed the statement relating to the higher ingestion of microplastics in
the Marina Trench.
Line 236-237 should be removed as no a key result from this study
Response: We have removed part of the sentence that relates to
toxicological effects.
Line 238: This study does not show plastics are culminating and
accumulating. Should not be a conclusion.
Response: We acknowledge there is no temporal aspect to these data so
therefore we cannot categorically say that plastics are “accumulating” in the
trenches we have studied. We do feel that we are justified to say plastics
are “culminating” because culminate means to reach a final point. Hadal
trenches are the deepest point of the ocean and microplastics arriving on
the seafloor of the hadal trenches are at culmination of a journey that
started from the surface waters or further afield. The bottom of trenches
are the final point at which they are bioavailable unless they float back to
the surface. We have removed “accumulating” replaced it with “ingested,
culminating and are therefore bioavailable…”. This reflects the results and
indicates that plastics are ingested by organisms within the deepest
ecosystem on the planet.
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript presents observations of microplastics from amphipods
sampled from hadal depths. It covers six locations across the general Pacific
region. From the observations authors conclude ‘it is likely that all marine
ecosystems … have been impacted by anthropogenic debris’. I suggest that
the authors did not require their new data to make this conclusion,
therefore need to reconsider what their data bring to the crowded field of
microplastics research.
Response:
We have rephrased the conclusions of the paper so that they highlight that
this is the first occurrence in the hadal zone and trench habitat of
microplastics being ingested by deep-sea organisms and the deepest record
to date. The FTIR analysis indicates that microplastic and synthetic fibres are
being ingested by organisms living in some of the deepest places on Earth.
This is a first discovery and adds yet another marine habitat, in this case
deep sea trenches, to the list where organisms are ingesting man-made
fibres. This discovery is the first recorded incidence. It is not an isolated
occurrence given the geographical area we have covered. This vastly
increases the previous maximum depth that microplastics have been
confirmed as being present in the guts of deep-sea organisms.
There are only two other papers that we are aware of that examine the
ingestion of microplastics in deep-sea organisms past 1000m. These are
Taylor et al 2016 (10.1038/srep33997) and Courtene-Jones et al (2017, doi
10.1039/C6AY02343F). Woodall et al 2014 (10.1098/rsos.140317) only
examines whether microplastics adhered to external structures of corals
sampled around 1000m. There are only 6 individuals in the Taylor et al 2016
(10.1038/srep33997) paper that have microfibers associated with them, 2 of
which were crustaceans and only one of which 1 had confirmed microfibers
in their stomach. These fibres were identified using a polarised light source.
There is no mention of FTIR analysis in the paper. Courtene-Jones et al
(2017, doi 10.1039/C6AY02343F) provide data on 3 deep-sea species with
sample sizes ranging between 7 and 49 from the Rockall Trough. They use
FTIR within their study but do not look at crustaceans as we have done.
In relation to what has been previous published on microplastic ingestion
within deep-sea organisms including species that ingest microplastics, depth
of occurrence, methodological technique used and geographical extent, this
paper clearly has a place in the “crowded field of microplastics”.
Specific comments follow
Abstract
Line 13-14 untrue- Ubiquity has been shown across geography and depths.
Agreed not the depths presented in this paper, how everywhere
microplastics have been looked for they have been found. Suggest
rephrasing this statement.
Response: We have altered these lines to be specifically related to depth
and ingestion which is the primary aim of the paper. It now reads:
“the ocean depth at which such contamination is ingested by organisms has
still not been established.”
Line 22 Plastic polymer names should be given in full instead of the
abbreviations
Response: We have changed the abbreviations to full names as requested.
Line 25-26, this is not new and the data in this paper are not required for
this hypothesis- see main comment
Response: We have altered the text so that it reads:
“indicating that anthropogenic debris is bioavailable to organisms at some
of the deepest locations in the Earth’s oceans.” rather than “indicating that
no marine ecosystems that have not been impacted by anthropogenic
debris.”
The altered text now clearly states that the microplastics are bioavailable in
the deepest locations within Earth’s oceans, which highlights both the
novelty of the results and the new data within this manuscript which is the
deepest possible record.
Keywords Spelling ‘microfiber’
Response: We have changed the spelling to “microfibre”.
Introduction
Line 36-41- Suggest removing, not relevant to the paper
Response: We have removed some of the text within these lines as the
reviewer suggested but kept other parts because we feel they are required
to frame the question relating to at what depths are microplastics
bioavailable to marine organisms. We have removed the following
sentence: “This is evidence from the proliferation of studies published on
plastics, with a basic Google Scholar search of ‘marine microplastics’
showing an exponential growth of scientific papers from 15 in 2006 to 997
in 2016. Within such data there is an intuitive and expected bias towards.”
Then we have altered the following sentence to: “The investigation of
microplastic ingestion by marine organisms has largely focused on shallow
water habitats given the ease of sampling these locations yet we know very
little about their ingestion in the deep sea.” The edited sentence highlights
the current bias in the microplastic literature towards shallow water
habitats. This now sets up our primary research question of whether
microplastic pollution extends to the full depth of the ocean and if it
bioavailable.
hLine 53- See Koelman et al 2016 and Bakir et al 2016 for discussion on this.
It is not as certain as authors suggest. It is important to qualify this
statement such as ‘Plastic could act as vectors…’
Koelmans, A. A., Bakir, A., Burton, G. A., & Janssen, C. R. (2016). Microplastic
as a vector for chemicals in the aquatic environment: critical review and
model-supported reinterpretation of empirical studies. Environmental
science & technology, 50(7), 3315-3326.
Bakir, A., O'Connor, I. A., Rowland, S. J., Hendriks, A. J., & Thompson, R. C.
(2016). Relative importance of microplastics as a pathway for the transfer of
hydrophobic organic chemicals to marine life. Environmental pollution, 219,
56-65.
Response: We have condensed the section on the link between plastic and
persistent organic pollutants in the introduction. We now have a single line
in the introduction which states:
“There is also the potential for plastics to act as a vector for pollutants
including persistent organic pollutants (e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls)….”.
We have used the references suggested by the reviewer to support the
statement.
Line 55 ref 16 is a review and does not support this statement in fact it
states ‘Hydrophobic contaminants are enriched on microplastics, but the
available experimental results and modelling approaches indicate that the
transfer of sorbed pollutants by microplastics is not likely to contribute
significantly to bioaccumulation of these pollutants.’
Response: We have removed this line from the introduction.
Line 63-Might be useful to add in this sentence that the negative impacts
documented to date are those from physical mechanisms of the
microplastics, as these are the impacts listed.
Response: We have not altered the sentence because we do not feel that
adding “physical” somewhere would add to the sentence.
Line 72- Fischer et al already show microplastics in hadal sediments. Why is
it not appropriate to extrapolate plastic presence to greater depth and
organism ingestion to those inhabiting those depths? The mechanisms for
microplastic sinking given in the papers cited, continue through the depths
of the ocean.
Response: On line 72 we do not state that it is not appropriate to
extrapolate that microplastics have not reached the deepest parts of the
ocean. We have merely stated that we do not know if they are present at
deeper locations than have been sampled because there is no published
data to show that they have. Fischer et al 2015
(10.1016/j.dsr2.2014.08.012) collected microplastic from box corers on the
upper margins of the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench and adjacent abyssal plain.
The deepest sampling point was 5768m for the sediments, which are not
hadal depths and are not the deepest point of the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench
(~10,500m). The paper also did not look for microplastic ingestion by the
organisms which were collected during the research cruise. If microplastics
are present in the environment you can hypothesise that it is likely they are
being consumed by the organisms living there but finding the particles in
the organisms’ guts is what is required in order to categorically say they are
being ingested. We have taken that step within this study and have
provided the first evidence that microplastics are ingested by organisms
living in hadal environments. Until you have confirmation that microplastics
are present, then any extrapolation to deeper depths and ingestion by those
organisms living there is still a hypothesis.
Methods
Line 118- Was the container cleaned?
Response: The container in which the samples were preserved in was not
cleaned. However, the animals arrived on the deck dead as a result of
decompression mortality. We did not examine any external structures like
gills or maxillipeds in case microplastics had adhered to the body during
ascent to the surface or were already in the container. The amphipods were
dead when they were preserved in ethanol and therefore unable to feed on
any particles that might have been in the container. It is highly unlikely that
a piece of plastic can passively enter the amphipods mouth, pass through
the foregut and enter the hindgut during preservation.
Line 123- What was lab coat made from? Where there any other controls
about clothing worn in the lab and during sample collection?
Response: There were no controls in place during sample collection because
the original collection was not designed specifically for microplastic studies.
There were controls in place to stop the amphipods feeding on the bait. This
means that if microplastics were present in the stomachs of the mackerel
they would not be transferred to the individuals collected. Given the
previous point whereby we highlight that the animals were dead on arrival
on deck, it is highly unlikely that the microplastics would have contaminated
by clothing during their transfer to the preservation jar. The laboratory coat
was a polyester-cotton mix and was white. We did not find any white fibres
in our samples nor on the control filter papers we placed inside the fume
hood. No additional clothing controls were made during the laboratory
work. We have added the following line to the methods section:
“We did not find any white fibres that may have been contamination from
the white laboratory coat worn during sample preparation.”
Results
Line 175-181 Suggest deleting. Not sure in the value of suggesting which
products the microplastics could have come from. Polymers are used over a
vast range of products and it is not possible to track microplastics to a
source. Maybe a simple statement that says a wide varied of polymers were
observed and therefore they likely come from a wide variety of products.
Response: We have removed the sentences regarding the products that
these plastics may have originated from.
Discussion
An important point for the discussion is that light microscope screening into
categories does not work, as stated lines 172-173.
Response: We have added the following text to the discussion:
“However, it is clear from the FTIR analysis and previous works that the
colour-based categorisation is not an adequate method to identify whether
a microparticle is indeed of plastic origin (Gago et al. 2016;
10.3389/fmars.2016.00219). The range of plastic found in the hindguts of
the amphipods included PE, PA, and polyvinyls resembling PVAL or PVC but
we also found other synthetic polymers that are not plastics (e.g. ramie,
lyocell).”
Line 196- Suggest deleting as the crude sorting process was not confirmed
with FTIR. Therefore discussion results based on a classification they
disprove is not useful. In addition I am unsure how useful it is to compare
between studies just using plastic colour as they could have been of any
material seen or unseen in the new data set.
Response: We have kept the crude colour-based categorisation because we
fell it helps place the spectrum of samples in context with what has been
found in Pacific surface waters. Many publications still do provide the crude
colour-based categorisation. Otherwise the alternative is to undertake FTIR
on every sample collected regardless of how many samples are found within
the stomachs of the organisms collected.
Line 209 - See comments associated with line 53. You really need to state
that most lab studies use concentrations and models that are not
representative in the wild see review by Galloway et al (2017) for
discussion.
Galloway, T. S., Cole, M., & Lewis, C. (2017). Interactions of microplastic
debris throughout the marine ecosystem. Nature ecology & evolution, 1(5),
0116.
Response: We have removed line 53 and added the reference by Galloway
et al. 2017 (10.1038/s41559-017-0116) in appropriate places within the
text.
Line 222 Trophic transfer conclusions are based on lab studies using very
high concentrations. Therefore the discussion needs to reflect this.
Response: We have added the following sentence to highlight that any
inference on trophic transfer has been made based on experiments:
“These studies were conducted under experimental conditions using high
concentrations of microplastics but their results indicate the possibility of
microplastics transferring among individuals (Farrell et al., 2013; Setälä et
al., 2014 ).”
Conclusion
Line 235- Due to limited sampling not sure it is an appropriate to conclude
higher ingestion rate in the Mariana Trench.
Response: We have removed this sentence.
Line 236 Suggest amending this sentence. Physical impacts have been
shown not chemical ones.
Ref 39 does not support this statement.
Response: We have removed part of the sentence that relates to
toxicological effects and made sure the references are correct.
Line 242 This is not a new conclusion see ref 7 cited in this manuscript
References
Response: Woodall et al. 2014 (10.1098/rsos.140317) examined
microplastics in sediments from a series of deep-sea habitats but did not
study a trench habitat nor went down to ~10,500m. The majority of their
samples were around 1000m depth with a single data point at 3500m within
the Mediterranean Sea. They did not examine whether the material had
been ingested by the organisms living at these depths but only whether
they adhered to the surface of corals in 4 specimens ranging in depth from
500 to 800m. This study is the first to report that microplastics have been
ingested by organisms living at hadal depths and within trench ecosystems.
The conclusion is still valid.
Line 295, ref 8 spelling ‘the’
Response: We have corrected the spelling.
Line 394 ref 48 Italics for scientific name
Response: We have put the species name in italics.
Line 403 ref 52 check capitalisation
Response: Reference corrected
Figure 3 legend- Suggest change ‘3’ to ‘three’
Response: There is no “3” in the Figure 3 legend.
Table 1- Give details on gear OBS and Latis
Response: We have provided a reference and full names of the gear used to
collect the amphipods in Table 1’s legend.

Dear Editorial Board,
Manuscript revision (RSOS-180667)
We have revised the following manuscript: “Microplastics and synthetic particles ingested by
deep-sea amphipods in six of the deepest marine ecosystems on Earth”.
We thank the reviewers for their comments and address them in red below.
Yours faithfully,
Dr Alan Jamieson
Response to reviewers
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
Thank you for addressing my previous concerns. I have a few more minor comments
In your responce to: Introduction Line 30: please update this value, 322 was the latest value
from Plastic Europe in 2015.
You stated that: We were unable to find this value on Plastic Europe website. In light of this,
we will stick with the value in Erickson et al. 2014 (10.1371/journal.pone.0111913) rather
than placing in an unreferenced source.
Using data from three years ago is inappropriate. Here is the reference. See page 16. All
scientific research has presented this data from earlier years, I see no reason why the
authors cannot/refuse to use this data
https://www.plasticseurope.org/en/resources/publications/274-plastics-facts-2017
We thank the reviewer for providing the information required and have now included this
value in the manuscript with an appropriate reference at the end.
I reiterate that 10 individuals per site is not an appropriate number, there is reference in the
literature that 20-50 individuals are required to give a good description of contamination
loads. Especially in areas as remote as the trenches. I highly urge the authors to increase the
numbers of individuals at each site, especially when they say there are more individuals to
use for analysis. This will have a better impact on the research community and will not be
looked at as “another” presence and absence paper.
We did not say that there were more individuals that could be used for analysis. We stated
that the samples for this study were chosen randomly from a larger pool of samples. Since
the work was carried out nearly two years ago, a large proportion of the material has been
used or is in the processes of being used for other research; some of which requires non-
destructive sampling. Given how precious, unique and difficult these samples are to obtain
and with no current plans to return to these areas, we cannot justify and do not have the
capacity to do these additional samples. The manuscript addresses whether microplastics
are ingested by hadal fauna, which was the primary aim of the work. These results still
remain the first records of hadal fauna ingesting microplastics as well as the deepest
records. Depending on how you define “impact”, we feel this work will have an “impact” at
scientific and societal levels. We also share the underlying opinion about just “another
presence/absence” paper, like the reviewer states, that was in part the motivation for doing
this study using extraordinary rare samples from the maximum depths of the ocean – to
prove that plastic ingestion is occurring everywhere and that ever deeper presence/absence
papers are not being all that helpful. This paper should bookend all these studies by
showing it extends to full ocean depth and as a result should be highly cited in that context.
Line 113: Question: do the authors know how fast digestion is in this species, could digestion
happen during capture? I would like to see some discussion around this point.
Response: We do not know how fast digestion is in these species. Feeding studies are
extremely difficult in hadal species because the amphipods arrive dead on deck as a result of
decompression mortality.
I thank the authors for this response. Such discussion would be useful in the document.
Digestion times are highlighted in coastal studies, and even staytong the ansers are not clear
but furture research would be needed would be suffice for the discussion.
We have added the following sentences to the end of the discussion that addresses the
reviewers request:
“The extent to which deep-sea amphipods can disperse microplastics across the seafloor is
currently unclear. This is because their digestion and defecation rates are currently
unknown.”
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors generally did a good job in amending the ms and provided a convincing
response to all queries, as detailed here below:
1. Number of individual per site and statistical analysis: The authors justified the reason
for the reduced number of samples. The study focuses more on the presence or absence of
microplastic in organisms. FT-IR analysis have been added clarified in the text.
No response required.
2. Comparability of the sites: the authors have answered in a comprehensive manner,
limiting themselves to highlighting the individual results in the different sites, specifying that
they do not know what the phenomena responsible for these different accumulations could
be.
No response required.
3. Include more discussion on other studies looking at deep-sea organisms: the authors
did not include Choy et al. 2013

This section of the discussion focuses on benthic invertebrates. Choy et al. 2013 paper
focuses on pelagic fish up to depth so 400m. The Choy et al. 2013 does appear in the
discussion later on discussing the mechanisms by which microplastics can be transferred to
the deep sea. It is reference 46.
4. Discussion on toxicological effects: this part of the discussion has been omitted in the
amended removed
No response required.
5. Effects of potassium hydroxide (KOH): the authors have have included more detailed
information on the treatment with KOH and added a reference that explains more about the
treatment
No response required.
Specific comments: all the comments have been taken into consideration by the authors,
except for the line 113 where authors express the impossibility to test how fast the digestion
is in the different species.
Please see the response to reviewer 2 regarding digestion rates.
I'm happy with the present version and I recommend its publication as it is

Appendix D
Dear Editor
As per an off line email conversation, the paper has been accepted subject to one last cryptic
comment by reviewer 1. They were asked to clarify this statement on November 28th, it is now
January 18th.
This paper was submitted in the autumn of 2017, the first round of reviews led us to go on and do
another set of analyses that greatly enhanced the paper and it was resubmitted in December 2017.
Since then it has taken THIRTEEN months going through just a few rounds of reviews of which I don’t
recall any of the comments really improving the manuscript at all. It is becoming very frustrating and
we have just lost the last two months waiting for clarification on another cryptic comment, that
regardless of the outcome of the query (if known) wouldn’t change anything in the paper anyway.
I acknowledge that you have tried to contact the reviewer again and that you are holding the
resubmission open until the end of January, but my colleagues and I are going to Antarctica on
Monday and therefore I am going to resubmit exactly the same version that we submitted months
ago in light of no further info from the reviewer. After much deliberation, we have decided that if
this goes back out to review again, then I think we have no option but to retract the manuscript and
go for another journal, otherwise we could be looking at a year and a half for publishing what is
actually a very straight forward paper that hasn’t really change much at all in that time.
Apologies if I sound frustrated, but this process has been exceptionally arduous.
If you have any news or queries or updates, please just email me on alan.jamieson@ncl.ac.uk

Alan
