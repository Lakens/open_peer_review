The manuscript RSOS-171830 represents a very timely and thorough assessment of lepidosaurian
diversity through time. The manuscript is very well written and structured, with very few minor
errors (see below) and is otherwise clearly presented, with adequate illustrations and
scientifically sound. The subsampled results are not overwhelming, which is, however,
acknowledged by the authors throughout the manuscript and caution is repeatedly raised with
respect to the varying quality of data through time and geography. Nonetheless, the study
provides very valuable insights into lepidosaurian diversity dynamics as well as apparent
sampling biases in their fossil record. I only have a very minor suggestions for changes.
Otherwise, I consider the manuscript essentially publishable as is. Hence, I strongly recommend
publication of this study in Royal Society Open Science after minor changes.

Lines 401-403 With regards to the fossorial amphisbaenians (in these localities) I would suggest to
more strongly emphasize the likelihood of a bias against their preservation rather than a genuine
aspect of this low diversity
Line 475 change to ‘taxa in Asia’, otherwise this could be misleading with regards to Asian taxa
even outside of Asia, e.g. immigrating into Europe as part of the Grande Coupure

This paper concerns generating raw and sampling-corrected time series of genus richness in
lepidosaurs (squamates plus rhynchocephalians) through a c. 230-m.y. sampling window and the
potential drivers of this diversity in terms of land area, sampling, and environmental proxies.
Lepidosaurs have long been overlooked with respect to these measures and the authors have
done the larger community a great service in depostiing their data in the Paleobiology database.
Although the key result - that richness is largely sampling-driven is a little disappinting the
authors have done their job well and not fallen into the trap of over-interpreting their data. All
statistical choices are, in my view, appropriate and sensibly interpreted. Consequently my
comments on potential improvements are essentially minor. I will address these separately as
general points first, and some line-by-line comments second.
General comments:
- The title could mention the sampling window in some way, e.g., instead of the vague "time", be
more specific and say something like "a 230-m.y. window".
- The introduction was, in my view, quite long and largely superfluous to the questions being
dealt with. The authors may want to consider a shorter version that "gets to the point" quicker.
- Although the onus is not on the authors to solve this problem as it plagues all such studies, my
only real methodological concern was with the re-binning of proxy data. It seems potentially
problematic to me to time average a proxy for, e.g., temperature, across bins of c. 9 million years
in length. Could this not artefactually obliterate a genuine correlation?
- I would have liked to see more on whether and why lepidosaurs seem to have a greater skew
towards the Northern hemisphere than other tetrapod groups. This seemed like the most
interesting part of the paper, especially as modern squamates are considered to largely be low-
latitude and thus should suffer from the dispersal barriers of higher latitude clades, e.g., by way
of contrast it seems fairly obvious why penguins have not made it across the equator to the
Southern hemisphere.
- Have the authors considered some subclade divisions to better explore their data? E.g., if lizards
and snakes do opposite things could this not confound the signal when combining them? I.e., in a
similar way to combining the continental data currently can to the global signal? (I realise sample
sizes are a major issue here.)
- Figures 1-3 would all benefit from adding a more comprehensive geologic timescale to the x-
axis, e.g., using the geoscale package in R.
- The authors make only very limited mention (L42) of phylogenetic expectations of lepidosaur
diversity over time. It might help to address what molecular phylogenies predict about
lepidosaur diversity and whether the fossil record is in disagreement or is simply too poorly
sampled.
- Additionally, would a comprehensive phylogeny of fossil lepidosaurs help? If so, what are the
barriers to generating one?
- I would modify Figure 3 as I found it hard to distinguish the points. Specifically I would: 1)
represent the global tetrapod data with light grey circles only to "push" them into the
background, 2) remove the black outline from the circles (as this makes them all look darker -
Figure 4 doesn't have these and works better for it), and 3) use brighter, more strongly
contrasting colours for the three points you wish to emphasise. I realise colourblindness is also a
concern here bu there are multiple R packages to help select appropriate choices for this.
Line-by-line comments:
L39 - "most speciose class of tetrapods" Somewhat pedancti, but I don't think it is very useful to
talk about diversity of classes, especially as this is only true because "Aves" are considered a
separate class, making "Reptilia" under that definition paraphyletic.
4
L109-110 - "Data were filtered following download to remove trace fossils, marine taxa, and
taxonomically indeterminate records, and to correct remaining time bin inconsistencies" Are all
these modifications tallied somewhere? Ideally there should be a list of each change in an R/Perl
script so that the steps can be reproduced.
L166-167 - "which we interpolated into 0.1 Ma intervals" But your diversity data is in 9 m.y. bins?
L182 - "version 3.2.2" This is slghtly out of date. Will the same tests work in the latest version?
L250-252 - "It is clear that the vast majority of lepidosaur occurrences are from the Northern
Hemisphere, and this appears to be a trend for tetrapods as a whole" Sure, but is this realy
unexpected given how much more continental landmasses are present in this hemisphere, both
now and historically? Our null here can't be equal hemispheric representation so it would be
helpful to distinguish between how much can be attributed to availability of fossil record and
how much to increased sampling of that record.
L289-291 - "This means that apparently ‘global’ richness curves predominantly tell us about the
number of continents that have been sampled of fossils in each interval, and should be
approached with caution" This really just repeats a point from earlier in the manuscript.
L295-296 - "This bias appears to be much more acute for lepidosaurs" WHy only appears? Can't
this be captured numerically? E.g., by mean proportion of occurrences in a hemisphere?
L296-297 - "sampling issues that might be specific to lepidosaurs (such as their small size and low
recovery potential)" It is not clear to me why this should differ between hemispheres. Perhaps
unpack this a bit more. Is this due to sampling methods, e.g., is sieveing of microfossil material
more common in Northern hemisphere cuuntries?
L308 - "are reduced to two genera (Gephyrosaurus and Clevosaurus)" Clevosaurus is (I think) by
far the most speciose genus of Rhynchocephalian. Should this be considered? I.e., if we instead
considered each species to represent a unique genus would this alone alter the pattern?
L341-343 - "This is important to note, as 341 studies mentioning richness through time might be
interpreting global patterns that are simply agglomerations of signals from different regions at
different times, rather than consistent, genuine macroevolutionary patterns" Again, this really
just repeats an earlier point.
L349 - "error for each other" *of
L350-351 - "higher taxonomic richness in the Campanian" Higher than...?
L383-384 - "After the sampling gap in the early Paleocene, we reach a period of excellent
sampling in both North America and Europe that reveals some interesting patterns" Do the
authors believe there is a Pull of the Recent bias in here? E.g., are we better able to distinguish
scrappy remains due to the assignment to living groups where the morphology is essentially
known perfectly?
L403-404 - "This differs from the findings of Mannion et al. [84] for crocodylians" Ok, but would
we expect them to be the same? The ecologies seem like they would likely be quite different, no?
L497 - "every explanatory variable besides in all" grammar.
L538 - "Although is tempting" Grammar.

Appendix A
We thank the referees for their interest in our paper, and we are very pleased to hear that both of
them found it interesting and requiring of only minor changes before publication. We have attempted
to take into account all of their comments in our revisions, as outlined below.
Reviewer 1
Line 86 additional references that could be cited here include: Fröbisch et al. 2014 or Brocklehurst et
al. 2013
These references were chosen to refer specifically to those studies examining large groups of taxa (i.e.
all terrestrial tetrapods), whereas the suggested references deal only with early synapsids (and we
excluded many other taxon-specific diversity papers that could also have been cited here to avoid the
need for excessive references). However, one of these papers was cited elsewhere in the article, and
we have added Frobisch et al. (2014) into the references on line 93, where it is more appropriate.
Line 193 change to ‘slightly higher’
Done, thank you.
Lines 401-403 With regards to the fossorial amphisbaenians (in these localities) I would suggest to
more strongly emphasize the likelihood of a bias against their preservation rather than a genuine
aspect of this low diversity
Changed to “… suggesting a genuine absence (or very low diversity) at this time [35] or, more likely, a
preservation bias against fossorial animals.”
Line 475 change to ‘taxa in Asia’, otherwise this could be misleading with regards to Asian taxa even
outside of Asia, e.g. immigrating into Europe as part of the Grande Coupure
Done.
Line 538 this should read ‚Although it is tempting’
Thanks for catching this. Changed.
Reviewer 2
General comments:
- The title could mention the sampling window in some way, e.g., instead of the vague "time", be more
specific and say something like "a 230-m.y. window".
Thank you for the suggestion. We have altered the title to “Lepidosaurian diversity in the Mesozoic–
Paleogene: the potential roles of sampling biases and environmental drivers” to better communicate
the time period covered by the study.
- The introduction was, in my view, quite long and largely superfluous to the questions being dealt
with. The authors may want to consider a shorter version that "gets to the point" quicker.
We considered the benefits of a shorter “to the point” introduction, but felt that since lepidosaurs
receive less attention than other tetrapod groups it would be pertinent to introduce the group
properly and to set the scene for the study by summarising what has been done so far, so that readers
do not have to sift through a multitude of other works in order to gain context for ours.
- Although the onus is not on the authors to solve this problem as it plagues all such studies, my only
real methodological concern was with the re-binning of proxy data. It seems potentially problematic
to me to time average a proxy for, e.g., temperature, across bins of c. 9 million years in length. Could
this not artefactually obliterate a genuine correlation?
The referee is correct to note that re-binning the proxy data can create problems, but unfortunately
given the methods used to compare proxies it’s impossible to compare two entirely different scales
without numerous assumptions. We can still, however, detect long-term patterns/trends in these
proxy data using averaged values through time, and given that the nature of the fossil record means
we only have relatively large time intervals designated for each fossil find (i.e. we can rarely pinpoint
fossil occurrence times below stage level) we are limited to working with the available record that we
have. Moreover, the lepidosaur record is so poorly sampled that long-term trends are the only trends
that we can examine with confidence.
- I would have liked to see more on whether and why lepidosaurs seem to have a greater skew towards
the Northern hemisphere than other tetrapod groups. This seemed like the most interesting part of
the paper, especially as modern squamates are considered to largely be low-latitude and thus should
suffer from the dispersal barriers of higher latitude clades, e.g., by way of contrast it seems fairly
obvious why penguins have not made it across the equator to the Southern hemisphere.
We agree with the referee that the geographic distribution of lepidosaurs through time is of interest,
but this area lies outside of the main scope of this contribution and will form the basis for a separate
paper that will delve more deeply into this aspect of lepidosaur history.
- Have the authors considered some subclade divisions to better explore their data? E.g., if lizards and
snakes do opposite things could this not confound the signal when combining them? I.e., in a similar
way to combining the continental data currently can to the global signal? (I realise sample sizes are a
major issue here.)
Unfortunately, snakes are too poorly sampled to separate out from the group, and doing so results in
only a few points being recovered at quorum level 0.4. The only sequential trend observed in snake
diversity is across the Eocene–Oligocene boundary in Europe (Pg4–5), which shows a slight decrease.
However, removing snakes from the lepidosaur dataset does allow us to recover some Paleogene bins
that had previously dropped out of the analysis (likely due to making these bins better sampled by
removing singleton snake taxa). We have added a paragraph from line 255 to reflect this:
“To test sensitivity to taxonomic sampling, we separated the snake occurrences from the dataset and
ran new analyses on these ‘snake-only’ and ‘other lepidosaur’ datasets. While snakes are too poorly
sampled to produce meaningful results, with the exception of a slight drop across the Eocene–
Oligocene boundary, their exclusion from the lepidosaur dataset causes a few points that had
previously dropped out of analyses (Pg1 of North America and Pg3 of Europe) to be recovered (see
supplementary figure S7). This is most likely due to a decrease in the number of singleton taxa that
would have otherwise been included in these bins, thus raising the maximum quorum level that they
could be sampled at, allowing us to recover a signal at quorum 0.4.”
We have also mentioned that the Pg3 EU point is present when you remove snakes (added to line
404). We reference supplementary figure S7, which is new, and shows richness through time for (a)
lepidosaurs minus snakes, and (b) snakes alone.
- Figures 1-3 would all benefit from adding a more comprehensive geologic timescale to the x-axis,
e.g., using the geoscale package in R.
We have altered the figures to better label the time bins used, which are explained in Table 1.
- The authors make only very limited mention (L42) of phylogenetic expectations of lepidosaur
diversity over time. It might help to address what molecular phylogenies predict about lepidosaur
diversity and whether the fossil record is in disagreement or is simply too poorly sampled.
An interesting point and we have added this paragraph at the end of the SQS results discussion in
response:
“It is important to note that many first occurrences of major lepidosaur taxa discussed above conflict
wildly with the divergence dates derived from molecular phylogenies (e.g. [104,134,135]. These
phylogenies, while disagreeing on smaller-scale details, propose that crown group squamates began
to diversify as early as the Middle Jurassic [134], with amphisbaenians diversifying approximately 100
Mya (mid-Cretaceous; [134]) or as early as 146 Mya (latest Jurassic; [104]). Snake phylogenies appear
to provide better divergence estimates, with some studies placing their divergence date at
approximately 125–130 Myr (Early Cretaceous; [104]), which is very close toalmost coincident with
the earliest snake fossil finds. Total evidence dating [135], which attempts to reconcile molecular and
morphological characters, comes closer to the divergence dates provided by the fossil record (e.g.
diversification of Amphisbaenia at ~60 Myr), but still proposes large ghost lineages for other groups
due to the lack of pre-Late Cretaceous material to calibrate these models. It is difficult to test these
and other molecular-based estimates of diversification times and rates when the fossil record is so
poor. So, at least for now, the origination times of major taxa remain unresolved.”
- Additionally, would a comprehensive phylogeny of fossil lepidosaurs help? If so, what are the barriers
to generating one?
Yes, but sadly there is no comprehensive phylogeny of fossil lepidosaurs, as many fossils are simply
too incomplete. There have been attempts to include some fossils in phylogenies, but the placement
of these fossil taxa often varies. Additionally, molecular and morphological trees disagree greatly on
the relationships of major squamate clades, so choosing a comprehensive phylogeny would be a
matter of subjective choice as there is currently little consensus.
- I would modify Figure 3 as I found it hard to distinguish the points. Specifically I would: 1) represent
the global tetrapod data with light grey circles only to "push" them into the background, 2) remove
the black outline from the circles (as this makes them all look darker - Figure 4 doesn't have these and
works better for it), and 3) use brighter, more strongly contrasting colours for the three points you
wish to emphasise. I realise colourblindness is also a concern here but there are multiple R packages
to help select appropriate choices for this.
We have altered the colour of the main points to be more easily distinguishable, and have changed
the colour of the background points to be less prominent.
Line-by-line comments:
L39 - "most speciose class of tetrapods" Somewhat pedantic, but I don't think it is very useful to talk
about diversity of classes, especially as this is only true because "Aves" are considered a separate class,
making "Reptilia" under that definition paraphyletic.
Thank you for pointing this out. We have removed this and reworded the sentence.
L109-110 - "Data were filtered following download to remove trace fossils, marine taxa, and
taxonomically indeterminate records, and to correct remaining time bin inconsistencies" Are all these
modifications tallied somewhere? Ideally there should be a list of each change in an R/Perl script so
that the steps can be reproduced.
We have now included the script and the lists of taxon names used to filter the initial download.
L166-167 - "which we interpolated into 0.1 Ma intervals" But your diversity data is in 9 m.y. bins?
Apologies if this section was unclear. We meant that since the palaeotemperature data was in uneven
intervals, we interpolated it into 0.1 Ma ones so we could then create the bin-length means needed
for comparison with all other proxies. Have reworded to try and make this clearer:
“For palaeotemperature we used sea surface <U+F064>18O records from [84] compiled by [85], which we
interpolated into 0.1 Ma intervals for ease of subsequent aggregation (see supplementary
information); more negative values indicate warmer temperatures, and vice versa. All proxy data was
then aggregated into within-bin means to enable comparisons with richness data.”
L182 - "version 3.2.2" This is slightly out of date. Will the same tests work in the latest version?
Yes, the tests remain valid. We have updated the version number in the text to reflect this.
L250-252 - "It is clear that the vast majority of lepidosaur occurrences are from the Northern
Hemisphere, and this appears to be a trend for tetrapods as a whole" Sure, but is this really
unexpected given how much more continental landmasses are present in this hemisphere, both now
and historically? Our null here can't be equal hemispheric representation so it would be helpful to
distinguish between how much can be attributed to availability of fossil record and how much to
increased sampling of that record.
This sentence was simply attempting to point out an observation that is common knowledge within
the fossil reptile community, but which is not stated explicitly in the literature. Since this is the Results
section we are simply stating what we see at face value. This distribution pattern is not unexpected,
given the greater landmass in the Northern Hemisphere, but there is clearly an underlying problem
with people preferentially sampling the Northern Hemisphere, especially in the earlier years of
palaeontology.
L289-291 - "This means that apparently ‘global’ richness curves predominantly tell us about the
number of continents that have been sampled of fossils in each interval, and should be approached
with caution" This really just repeats a point from earlier in the manuscript.
This is an important point that we wanted to emphasise in the Discussion, and so felt repetition was
necessary here, especially as many other workers in the field do not always explore their global data
sets in this way.
L295-296 - "This bias appears to be much more acute for lepidosaurs" Why only appears? Can't this
be captured numerically? E.g., by mean proportion of occurrences in a hemisphere?
This is an observation derived from the results presented in the figure, hence the “appears” modifier.
As mentioned above, we will be discussing more about the latitudinal distribution aspects of the data
in a separate paper. Capturing numerical data is difficult, because it is plagued by the same problems
we have with richness data, which is that things are often too poorly sampled to tell.
L296-297 - "sampling issues that might be specific to lepidosaurs (such as their small size and low
recovery potential)" It is not clear to me why this should differ between hemispheres. Perhaps unpack
this a bit more. Is this due to sampling methods, e.g., is sieving of microfossil material more common
in Northern hemisphere countries?
We are not suggesting that sampling methods differ between hemispheres but that 1) there are major
differences in sampling effort between the two (see above) and that 2) there are sampling issues that
disproportionally affect the recovery of small bodied taxa in comparison with other tetrapods (e.g.
lack of specialist collecting techniques, such as sieving). The dearth of Southern Hemisphere lizard
fossils especially is probably part genuine but exacerbated by sampling. There are certainly fewer
localities in the southern continents that produce well-preserved microvertebrates and few of these
have been analysed; those that have remain largely undescribed. There are also fewer lithographic
limestone localities that have been comprehensively studied for terrestrial microvertebrates. For
example, lizards are present in the Crato Formation, but few are well preserved and even fewer have
been described. There are also microvertebrate sites with potential in several African countries, but
collected material has not been described or potentially good sites are now dangerous to visit.
L308 - "are reduced to two genera (Gephyrosaurus and Clevosaurus)" Clevosaurus is (I think) by far the
most speciose genus of Rhynchocephalian. Should this be considered? I.e., if we instead considered
each species to represent a unique genus would this alone alter the pattern?
Clevosaurus is speciose, and we think it’s interesting because the result of becoming near-
monogeneric reflects a loss of disparity that may reflect an important ecological change in
rhynchocephalians. In addition, lepidosaurs are poorly sampled and often cannot be identified to
species level, hence the choice of genus-level analyses to conserve data (there are many specimens
under the designation “Clevosaurus sp.” that would be excluded otherwise).
L341-343 - "This is important to note, as studies mentioning richness through time might be
interpreting global patterns that are simply agglomerations of signals from different regions at
different times, rather than consistent, genuine macroevolutionary patterns" Again, this really just
repeats an earlier point.
We have changed this section to read:
“This is important to note since, as mentioned above, apparently “global” patterns are unreliable.”
Again, we regard this as an important message to convey, hence the repetition.
L349 - "error for each other" *of
Changed, thank you.
L350-351 - "higher taxonomic richness in the Campanian" Higher than...?
… the Maastrichtian, which is mentioned in the previous sentence, but we have added “than in the
Maastrichtian” to 351 as well for better clarification.
L383-384 - "After the sampling gap in the early Paleocene, we reach a period of excellent sampling in
both North America and Europe that reveals some interesting patterns" Do the authors believe there
is a Pull of the Recent bias in here? E.g., are we better able to distinguish scrappy remains due to the
assignment to living groups where the morphology is essentially known perfectly?
This is the case to a certain extent, as there are many good later Paleogene microvertebrate sites in
Europe and North America that yield lizard remains. Modern groups are clearly being sampled by this
point, and are often recognisable based on our knowledge of living groups. But many fossils remain
scrappy, even though occurrences increase, and so can prevent us from finding the identifying marks
of modern taxa. Many genera have no living representatives, and this makes them more difficult to
identify. Additionally, the pull of the recent effect of the larger availability of younger rock does not
seem to apply here, as there are many more tetrapod-bearing formations in the late Eocene and
Oligocene, but these numbers are comparable to the latest Cretaceous. The rest of the Paleocene has
formation numbers comparable to the earlier Late Cretaceous.
L403-404 - "This differs from the findings of Mannion et al. [84] for crocodylians" Ok, but would we
expect them to be the same? The ecologies seem like they would likely be quite different, no?
This was based on the fact that both groups are ectotherms and might share some responses to
climatic change. Mesozoic and Paleogene crocs include terrestrial as well as amphibious forms and
had a broader ecological range than their living representatives. The main difference would be average
body size. However, the increased body size of crocs does not render them immune to the effects of
temperature change (despite being large and living in thermally buffered environments, extant croc
distribution is much more tightly controlled by MAT than that of squamates). Moreover, it seemed
appropriate to compare results from different contemporary reptile groups to compare pattern.
We added a line: “This contrasts with our prior expectation that key groups of endotherms would
show similar patterns of change in genus richness, coordinated by environmental change.”
L497 - "every explanatory variable besides in all" grammar.
Thank you; missing word added and changed to: “every explanatory variable besides TBCs in all”.
L538 - "Although is tempting" Grammar.
Added “it” into the middle. Thanks.
