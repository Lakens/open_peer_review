2. check literature citations and formatting
3. XCPP and Norcantharidin are conjugated directly. The authors show a linker in Figure 2,
whereas there is no linker
4. Norcantharidin structure is changed for conjugation
That may change the activity
5. The activity of the conjugate was less than that of the separate drugs. The claim of synergistic
effects is not proven by the data

In this manuscript Zhao and co-workers describe the synthesis of a series of HCPT
norcantharidin 10-phenolic esters. The key point in this work is the selectivity in the esterification
reaction. The manuscript and the experimental section are clear. In my opinion the manuscript
should be accepted to publish after minor corrections, which are highlighted in yellow in the PDF
file (see Appendix A).

were regio-selectively synthesized in a condition of EDCI in a moderated yield. The
14
15 synthesized conjugate HCPT pro-drugs simultaneously suppress cancer cell growth in

3 Introduction
4
5
6 Topoisomerase I, a vital DNA-manipulating enzyme, is the only known target for
7
8 camptothecin (Staker et al., 2005; Yadav and Khan, 2013; Mi et., 1994), which binds to
9
10 the interface of the covalent protein-nucleic acid complex. 20-(S)-Camptothecin (CPT)
11
12
13
was originally discovered in the early 1960s, by Wanis group at the NCI, from an extract
14
15 of the bark of the Chinese tree Camptotheca acuminate- a common deciduous tree used
16
17 for ages in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to the high toxicity and low bioavailability
18
19
camptothecin was not usable as an anticancer agent in vivo (Wall et al., 1966;
20
21
22 Vishnuvajjala and Garzon-Aburbeh, 1990).
23
24 It was discovered that the quinoline moiety of CPT could be substituted without loss of
25
26 activity. This bicyclic nucles can be decorated with a large amount of functional groups
27
28
29 (Miao et al., 2013), especially the introduction of hydroxyl group in 10-position, while
30
31 preserving and even in some cases promoting the cytotoxic action of the parent natural
32
33 product. Structure reactivity relationship (SAR) studies of camptothecin derivatives
34
35
36
summarized that a hydroxyl substitution at the 10-position, such as topotecan and
37
38 irinotecan, enhanced antitumor activity (Jin et al., 2017). This led to the design and
39
40 development of the two major anticancer drugs topotecan and irinotecan (Ulukan and
41
42
Swaan, 2002) (Fig 1).

27 In general, for a given cancer there are several operating cancer genes or pathways. At
28
29 the same time, metastasis is a major obstacle to anticancer therapies and responsible for
30
31 most therapeutic failures, while the drug resistance is always going to be a problem for
32
33
34
concern. Given these things, the dual target drug will be needed for optimal therapeutic
35
36 effect (Xie et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2017; Cai et al., 2017; Friedl and Wolf, 2003; Chabner
37
38 and Roberts, 2005).
39
40
In our ongoing project, HCPT was chosen as a main anticancer pro-drug to conjugate
41
42
43 with another anticancer drug Norcantharidin owing its unique feature of stimulation of
44
45 the bone marrow production of white cells, which is in contrast to most other anticancer
46
47 drugs that readily induce myelo-suppression (Hill et al., 2007; Essers et al., 2001;
48
49
50 McCluskey et al., 2000). The dual anticancer drugs assemblies (Sun et al., 2017; Xu et al.,
51
52 2006) was thus constructed, because HCPT was the DNA-topoisomerase I inhibitor and
53
54 norcantharidin will also suppress the cancer cell growth by inhibit PP.

7
8 improve its efficiency (Fig 2). The result was summarized in the following.

9 Results and Discussions
10
11 10-hydroxy camptothecin and norcantharidin are both commercial available materials,
12
13
14 which were thus chosen as starting materials to prepare this target molecule (I) (Gupta
15
16 and Mahajan, 2017). In our recent published literature (Wang, et al., 2018), a sealed tube
17
18 promoted coupling of camptothecin wth norcantharidin can easily produce
19
20
21 20(S)-O-linked ester in moderate to high yield. Continued with this finding, the coupling
22
23 of 10-hydroxy camptothecin with norcantharidin derivatives was also expected to form
24
25 the corresponding 20(S)-O-linked ester (4). However, to our surprise, a 10-O-linked
26
27
phenolic ester was formed in the presence of EDCI and DMAP, DCM as a solvent under
28
29
30 reflux condition (Scheme 3).

21 In order to determine which of OH groups participated in the coupling reaction of
22
23
24
HCPT with norcantharidin, we measured 1HNMR spectrum of HCPT using DMSO-d6 as
25
26 solvent. It is not difficult to find that the phenolic hydroxyl group lies in d = 10.22 ppm
27
28 and alcoholic hydroxyl group lies in d = 6.4 ppm. Thus, in 1H NMR spectrum of product
29
30
3a prepared from the coupling of HCPT and norcantharidin mono methyl ester 2a, the
31
32
33 peak of 10-phenolic hydroxyl group disappeared completely, which strongly indicates
34
35 that the phenolic hydroxyl group participates in the coupling reaction.
36
37 Thus, norcantharidin monoacid monoesters 2a-i was chosen as material to couple with
38
39
40 HCPT in the condition of EDCI and DMAP at ambient temperature for 2 days to give the
41
42 corresponding product. The results were summarized in Table 2.

29 Conclusions A series of HCPT norcantharidin 10-phenolic esters were selectively
30
31 synthesized via the coupling of HCPT with norcantharidin mono acid esters. The
32
33 synthesized target compounds were characterized by 1HNMR and 13
CNMR. This series
34
35
36
of compounds have also preserved a strong activity against several cancer cell lines and
37
38 the synergistic effects were observed.

Appendix B
Response to reviewer
Reviewer 1
Comments to the Author(s)
1. Language needs to be edited. for example, page 3, line 26 "nucles "
" decorated'
page 4, line 54 ( inhibit PP)
Response: corrected
2. check literature citations and formatting
Response: corrected
3. XCPP and Norcantharidin are conjugated directly. The authors show a linker in
Figure 2, whereas there is no linker
Response: In this paper, HCPT conjugated with Norcantharidin directly whereas the
number of carbon atom for the linker is zero. This first step can give us a preliminary
knowledge about the conjugates activity and its physical properties. In the next step,
linkers containing more carbon atoms will be introduced.
4. Norcantharidin structure is changed for conjugation
That may change the activity
Response: Exactly, the introduction of Norcantharidin structure to HCPT may change
the activity. From the data in vitro to see, the activity of the conjugate is similar to that
of the separate drugs. On the other hand, the solubility of the conjugate in organic
solvents is much better than that of HCPT, which can increase its bioavailability.
5. The activity of the conjugate was less than that of the separate drugs. The claim of
synergistic effects is not proven by the data
Response: From the data in vitro, the activity of the conjugate is similar to that of the
separate drugs. Therefore, we correct the claim of synergistic effects and just claim
that the new synthesized conjugates can suppress cancer cell growth.

Comments to the Author(s)
In this manuscript Zhao and co-workers describe the synthesis of a series of HCPT
norcantharidin 10-phenolic esters. The key point in this work is the selectivity in the
esterification reaction. The manuscript and the experimental section are clear. In my
opinion the manuscript should be accepted to publish after minor corrections, which
are highlighted in yellow in the PDF file.
Response: corrected as reviewer suggested
