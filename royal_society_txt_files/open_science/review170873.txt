The title "Targeted Delivery of Magnetic Drug Aerosols in the Human Upper and Central
Respiratory System: A Validation Study" is quite misleading and needs to reflect that v only a
"realistic" in silicon model was used. The paper is quite long for the limited additional
information that is being presented, and the authors have not sufficiently responded with
reduction in length, nor provided convincing rationale that their new information on the topic is
sufficiently meaningful to be of interest to the readers.

Dear Dr Kenjeres,
I am pleased to inform you that your manuscript entitled "Numerical Simulations of Targeted
Delivery of Magnetic Drug
Aerosols in the Human Upper and Central Respiratory System: A Validation Study" is now
accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
You can expect to receive a proof of your article in the near future. Please contact the editorial
office (openscience_proofs@royalsociety.org and openscience@royalsociety.org) to let us know if
you are likely to be away from e-mail contact. Due to rapid publication and an extremely tight

hors response: We adopted all proposed editorial changes – indicated by red colored font in
manuscript.
s 1(c) 1(d) and 1(e) need to be enlarged for the computational grids to be visible to readers.
hors response: We enlarged all mentioned figures (up to 20%) to be visible also in printed
n of the manuscript.
2: State why scale maximum for y+n is set al 1.5 when a value of about 2 appears in the text.
hors response: Please note that this value of y+ of 1.5 shown in color bar of Fig.2 does not
e the maximum value (it is actually a first line below the maximum, which can be seen from the
in of Fig.2b). In the main text it is stated that this value is approximately 2.
cations of the planes shown in Figure 8 are difficult to assimilate without a sketch at the same
n. The profile of the upper airway in the z axis direction is available in outline form as Figure 5
t the analysis from the simulations. I suggest using this profile, showing the z-axis plane
ns as part of Figure 8. The same comment as above applies to Figure 9.
hors response: The sketches of these locations (plane(1)-(3)-(4)-(6) are already indicated/shown
.10a, 11a, 12a and 13a, respectively). We explicitly added this information in caption of Figure
ours of the non-dimensional modulus of velocity ($\rm |U|/U_{\rm ref}$) at various horizontal
ections (plane(1)-plane(3)-plane(4)-plane(6) at z=0.1, 0.135, 0.146 and 0.161 m, which are also
ed in Figs.10a, 11a, 12a and 13a, respectively) of the geometry shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1}: left-
ments (MRV of \cite{Banko2015}), right- LES with the WALE subgrid model.”

formation on the topic is sufficiently meaningful to be of interest to the readers.
hors response:
agree with Reviewer that a limited additional information is presented. To our best knowledge, it
irst time that RANS-SST and LES are simultaneously compared with 3D MRV experiments in a
t specific geometry. As an additional novel element, we presented also the spatial distributions
realistic active pharmaceutical ingredient with the magnetic carriers, under various external
ed magnetic fields. We believe that our rationale was clearly stated in the Introduction:
otivation of the present research is triggered by the experimental study of the targeted delivery
gnetic aerosol droplets to intact mice lungs, as reported in \cite{Dames2007}. It was
strated that steering magnetic droplets towards the right lung could be achieved by imposing
ently high magnetic field gradients close to the main trachea bifurcation. This magnetic steering
d an overall four-fold increase of medical drug deposition compared to the neutral situation. In
sion, \cite{Dames2007} suggested further developments and scaling-up of the magnetic steering
ch to the human lungs. The primary goal of the present research is to check, by performing a
of numerical simulations, to what extent (if at all) it is possible to achieve a magnetic control of
erosols distribution in the human airways.”
