General Comments
1. The manuscript provides a valuable description and analysis of available data on
species-sex-length-frequency composition of shark catches by hooks and gillnets in Western
Australia. The results of the analyses show important differences in size composition and sex
ratio among separate regions of several species. The manuscript would be valuable report to a
fisheries management agency, but it could be a more valuable scientific paper if there was more
discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the methods applied and some mention of
alternative approaches (see comments below).
2. The analyses applied are defensible, but as a reader from outside WA I wonder why the
authors did not apply a simpler analysis given the issues of (1) potential collinearity or
interactions among the presumably independent variables of latitude, longitude and depth, (2)
the landmass of WA dividing longitude between north and south, and dividing latitude between
west and east in the southern region of WA, and (3) the usual practice of defining fishery
management zones by lines drawn on the water away from the land to a prescribed distance from
the land or a prescribed depth. These potential issues could be avoided, at least in part, by
dividing the WA coast into radial sectors and applying depth intervals varied according to
species and amount of available data. This would reduce the number of independent variables to
two (sector and depth) with the single interaction term of sector x depth. Variables in a non-
orthogonal design can be tested by the GenMod procedure of the statistical package SAS.
3. Regional names applied are confusing. The spatial analyses presented in the manuscript
cover all waters off Western Australia (WA), yet the title of the manuscript refers to the west
coast of Australia. The text refers to “north”, “northwest”, “west”, “southwest” and “south”, but
these regions are not defined nor shown on a map explicitly.
4. The assumption that 1 degree of latitude by 1 degree of longitude is 60 nm by 60 nm is
not quite correct because meridians of longitude converge at the poles; “1 degree of latitude by 1
degree of longitude is 60 nm by ~60 nm” would be more correct.
5. The manuscript uses local common names rather than scientific names for species in the
text, whilst most readers of an international journal are more likely to be familiar with scientific
names. I appreciate that it is cumbersome to present both common and scientific name for a long
list of species, so I suggest presenting only scientific names in the text and the reader can
eventually see the common names in the supplementary tables.
6. In addition to points already raised in the manuscript and those raised above, there
should be some discussion of several other matters related to interpretation of the results.
- The high significance levels presented in Tables 1 and 2 are a reflection of very large
sample sizes (n>1000) for several species with sufficient statistical power to detect extremely
small differences in length-frequency composition and sex ratio. The question that then arises is
how large do the differences need to be to justify establishing separate management zones or
applying spatially-structured stock assessment models. Given the strong statement in the third
sentence of the first paragraph of the Introduction, for each species separately, it would be
appropriate to establish a criterion for grouping regions, 1 degree by 1 degree blocks, or sectors
into suitable zones for management and modelling purposes
- Many species of shark exhibit differences maximum length between males and females.
This suggests that if the effect of locality is significant for sex ratio, then it is likely that the effect
of length will also be significant. Hence, where sex ratio is significant, there is an argument to test
for the effects of length for the males and females separately.
3
- Length-frequency composition of a catch is dependent on the length-selectivity effects of
the fishing gear and the length-frequency composition of the fished population is dependent on
the history of length-selective fishing mortality; hence there is potential confounding between
stock structure and the effects of fishing, particularly for highly selective gear such as gillnets.
Specific comments
1. Line 33. I suggest altering from ‘fishing pressure’ to ‘fishing effort’ or ‘fishing’. The term
“fishing pressure” is colloquial and should be avoided in a scientific paper.
2. Lines 34<U+2012>35. I suggest altering from ‘is therefore paramount to defining the right spatial
scale for managing shark populations’ to ‘assists defining boundaries for spatially-structured
models and fisheries management.
3. Lines 41<U+2012>44. Given that the manuscript is dealing with gillnet and longline fisheries, the
sentence starting “For example …” is misleading because medium size mesh-sizes as used in WA
are likely to have higher selectivity and hence cause higher fishing mortality on medium-sized
sharks than on large mature females that can deflect from the nets. This is potentially important
in lines 78<U+2012>80; the use of different gears or different mesh-size of gillnets in different regions are
likely to produce differences in size-frequency composition of catches independently of stock
structuring.
4. Line 57. I suggest altering from ‘by research scientists and technicians’ to ‘scientifically
trained observers’. What is of greater interest to the reader is whether the sampling was
undertaken as part of a robust statistical design or, as suggested near the end of the manuscript,
opportunistically.
5. Line 59. Alter from ‘were done’ to ‘were’; “done” is redundant here.
6. Lines 62<U+2012>65. It should be mentioned here that sex of each shark was recorded.
7. Lines 66<U+2012>67. The sentence starting “Live individuals …” is not relevant given the tag
data were not used to for determining stock structuring.
8. Line 71. Alter from ‘unfeasible’ to ‘infeasible’.
9. Lines 71<U+2012>74. The sentence starting “Hence …” indicates that the data were spatially
stratified, but there is no indication that the data were temporally stratified. From the description
here, it is possible that separate locations could be sampled during different periods where
significant differences in size-frequency composition were a result of high fishing mortality
reducing sizes over time.
10. Lines 77<U+2012>78. Alter from ‘10 metre bins’ to ‘10-m bins’; “10-m” is being used as a
compound adjective and therefore should be hyphenated.
11. Line 155. The acronym DoF is not defined. It would be better to use the full name of the
organisation.
12. Line 196. In reference 9, volume and page numbers are missing.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors use a large fisheries data-set to look at large scale size and sexual segregation of
sharks along the western coast of Australia. The scale of the analysis is certainly interesting and
worthy of publication as few studies of patterns of shark distribution have been able to
investigate these factors at such a large scale. However, I was left unsure about the statistics. The
statistical results do not seem to match the graphical results very well and I would suggest
someone with greater expertise in statistics check them over. There are also several relevant
articles that were not cited but probably should be.
The introduction starts discussing shark movement, yet this link to the actual paper and size or
sex segregation is never made. It would be interesting if some of the results could be put in the
context of what is known about the movements of those species (e.g. those that have very large
home ranges vs residential vs transient etc).
Pg 3, line 40. This is a very large statement yet the only citation given is a technical report. Is there
anything that is peer-reviewed that also supports this?
Line 44. Is there a citation for this? It’s an important point
Overall I am not sure if the statistics are completely appropriate. Would generalized additive
models be a better approach with the best candidate models selected using information criteria?
It also doesn’t seem that the response would be linear for these relationships. I also wonder if
latitude and longitude are the best units to use. Would UTM be better as the values directly
correspond to a distance measurement? For example, the results all show depth to be highly
significant in terms of its effect on size and sexual segregation. Looking at the actual graphs this
seems highly unlikely (and the authors seem to acknowledge that in the discussion). E.g. only
dusky and sandbar sharks show clear size segregation with lattitude (this is a really interesting
result by the way. Both figure 1 and 2 alone make this paper worth publishing).
Figure 1. There should be some reference to what the size of the bubbles translate to (in terms of
shark FL). Can a figure legend be included?
Figure S4 is difficult to interpret. Maybe just include data for 1 or 2 species with the sample size
for each month?
I also feel there are additional references that could be useful. For example, changes in sex ratio
with depth have been published for tigers and sandbar sharks in Hawaii (McElroy et al. 2006 Env
Biol Fish, Papastamatiou et al. 2006, MEPS).

General Comments
1. The manuscript provides a valuable description and analysis of available data on species-sex-
length-frequency composition of shark catches by hooks and gillnets in Western Australia. The
results of the analyses show important differences in size composition and sex ratio among separate
regions of several species. The manuscript would be valuable report to a fisheries management
agency, but it could be a more valuable scientific paper if there was more discussion of the strengths
and weaknesses of the methods applied and some mention of alternative approaches (see
comments below).
Suggestion adopted. We included a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the analytical
methods applied (lines 150-171).
2. The analyses applied are defensible, but as a reader from outside WA I wonder why the
authors did not apply a simpler analysis given the issues of (1) potential collinearity or interactions
among the presumably independent variables of latitude, longitude and depth, (2) the landmass of
WA dividing longitude between north and south, and dividing latitude between west and east in the
southern region of WA, and (3) the usual practice of defining fishery management zones by lines
drawn on the water away from the land to a prescribed distance from the land or a prescribed
depth. These potential issues could be avoided, at least in part, by dividing the WA coast into radial
sectors and applying depth intervals varied according to species and amount of available data. This
would reduce the number of independent variables to two (sector and depth) with the single
interaction term of sector x depth. Variables in a non-orthogonal design can be tested by the
GenMod procedure of the statistical package SAS.
Suggestion adopted. We simplified the analyses to minimize the potential collinearity between
variables and the other issues mentioned by the reviewer (lines 68-79).
3. Regional names applied are confusing. The spatial analyses presented in the manuscript
cover all waters off Western Australia (WA), yet the title of the manuscript refers to the west coast
of Australia. The text refers to “north”, “northwest”, “west”, “southwest” and “south”, but these
regions are not defined nor shown on a map explicitly.
Suggestion adopted. We changed the title and several parts of the MS to maintain consistency in the
regional names (lines 2, 13, Figures 1 and 2).
quite correct because meridians of longitude converge at the poles; “1 degree of latitude by 1
degree of longitude is 60 nm by ~60 nm” would be more correct.
Suggestion adopted. We changed “60 by 60 nautical miles” to “one degree latitude by one degree
longitude” (lines 283 and 287). Note that this change is only relevant to Figures 1 and 2 because
statistical analyses are now done at the ‘management zone’ level and not at the ‘block’ level as
suggested by Reviewer #1.
5. The manuscript uses local common names rather than scientific names for species in the
text, whilst most readers of an international journal are more likely to be familiar with scientific
names. I appreciate that it is cumbersome to present both common and scientific name for a long
list of species, so I suggest presenting only scientific names in the text and the reader can eventually
see the common names in the supplementary tables.
Suggestion adopted. We use scientific names throughout the MS and only present both common and
scientific names in the supplementary table.
6. In addition to points already raised in the manuscript and those raised above, there should
be some discussion of several other matters related to interpretation of the results.
- The high significance levels presented in Tables 1 and 2 are a reflection of very large sample
sizes (n>1000) for several species with sufficient statistical power to detect extremely small
differences in length-frequency composition and sex ratio. The question that then arises is how large
do the differences need to be to justify establishing separate management zones or applying
spatially-structured stock assessment models. Given the strong statement in the third sentence of
the first paragraph of the Introduction, for each species separately, it would be appropriate to
establish a criterion for grouping regions, 1 degree by 1 degree blocks, or sectors into suitable zones
for management and modelling purposes
- Many species of shark exhibit differences maximum length between males and females. This
suggests that if the effect of locality is significant for sex ratio, then it is likely that the effect of
length will also be significant. Hence, where sex ratio is significant, there is an argument to test for
the effects of length for the males and females separately.
- Length-frequency composition of a catch is dependent on the length-selectivity effects of
the fishing gear and the length-frequency composition of the fished population is dependent on the
history of length-selective fishing mortality; hence there is potential confounding between stock
structure and the effects of fishing, particularly for highly selective gear such as gillnets.
Suggestion adopted. We included a discussion of the several points raised by Reviewer #1 in lines
150-171.
Specific comments
1. Line 33. I suggest altering from ‘fishing pressure’ to ‘fishing effort’ or ‘fishing’. The term
“fishing pressure” is colloquial and should be avoided in a scientific paper.
Suggestion adopted. We changed ‘fishing pressure’ to ‘fishing’ (line 34).
scale for managing shark populations’ to ‘assists defining boundaries for spatially-structured models
and fisheries management.
Suggestion adopted. We changed ‘is therefore paramount to defining the right spatial scale for
managing shark populations’ to ‘therefore assists defining boundaries for spatially-structured models
and fisheries management’ (lines 35-36).
3. Lines 41<U+2012>44. Given that the manuscript is dealing with gillnet and longline fisheries, the
sentence starting “For example …” is misleading because medium size mesh-sizes as used in WA are
likely to have higher selectivity and hence cause higher fishing mortality on medium-sized sharks
than on large mature females that can deflect from the nets. This is potentially important in lines
78<U+2012>80; the use of different gears or different mesh-size of gillnets in different regions are likely to
produce differences in size-frequency composition of catches independently of stock structuring.
Comment. Note that this is a very general statement on the effect of fishing on exploited populations.
Regardless of what gear is used for catching fish, how fishing mortality is distributed (either by using
selective gears and/or heterogeneously distributing fishing effort in space) across age/size classes
must be understood for improved management. Note the use of longlines and gillnets overlap
spatially and temporally so the effect of gear sampling selectivity is minimised. We included a
discussion of this point in the paragraph on strengths and weaknesses (lines 150-171).
4. Line 57. I suggest altering from ‘by research scientists and technicians’ to ‘scientifically
trained observers’. What is of greater interest to the reader is whether the sampling was undertaken
as part of a robust statistical design or, as suggested near the end of the manuscript,
opportunistically.
Suggestion adopted. We changed ‘by research scientists and technicians’ to ‘scientifically trained
observers (line 58).
5. Line 59. Alter from ‘were done’ to ‘were’; “done” is redundant here.
Suggestion adopted. We changed ‘Gear deployments were done..’ to ‘Gear was deployed…’ (line 60).
6. Lines 62<U+2012>65. It should be mentioned here that sex of each shark was recorded.
Suggestion adopted. We added the term ‘sexed’ (line 63).
7. Lines 66<U+2012>67. The sentence starting “Live individuals …” is not relevant given the tag data
were not used to for determining stock structuring.
Suggestion adopted. This sentence was removed.
8. Line 71. Alter from ‘unfeasible’ to ‘infeasible’.
Suggestion adopted. We changed ‘unfeasible’ to ‘infeasible’ (line 73).
9. Lines 71<U+2012>74. The sentence starting “Hence …” indicates that the data were spatially
stratified, but there is no indication that the data were temporally stratified. From the description
significant differences in size-frequency composition were a result of high fishing mortality reducing
sizes over time.
Suggestion adopted. We clarified that only species with at least 10 years of observations per zone
were selected for the analyses (lines 74-76).
10. Lines 77<U+2012>78. Alter from ‘10 metre bins’ to ‘10-m bins’; “10-m” is being used as a compound
adjective and therefore should be hyphenated.
Suggestion adopted. We changed 10 metre bins’ to ‘10-m bins’ (line 81).
11. Line 155. The acronym DoF is not defined. It would be better to use the full name of the
organisation.
Suggestion adopted. We spelled out DoF (line 208).
12. Line 196. In reference 9, volume and page numbers are missing.
Suggestion adopted. We added the missing information (line 237).
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors use a large fisheries data-set to look at large scale size and sexual segregation of sharks
along the western coast of Australia. The scale of the analysis is certainly interesting and worthy of
publication as few studies of patterns of shark distribution have been able to investigate these
factors at such a large scale. However, I was left unsure about the statistics. The statistical results
do not seem to match the graphical results very well and I would suggest someone with greater
expertise in statistics check them over. There are also several relevant articles that were not cited
but probably should be.
Suggestion adopted. Following comments by Reviewer #1 we modified the statistical approach.
Please note that as raised by Reviewer#1, significant effects can be obtained if very large samples
sizes are used, as in our study. This does not mean the effects have biological significance. We
reflected on this when interpreting results and concluded that only 4 species show clear large scale
patterns despite many species showing significant zone and depth effects in size and sex ratios.
In regards to the Reviewer’s comment on citing further articles, we have included the references
suggested by the Reviewer in lines 165-166.
The introduction starts discussing shark movement, yet this link to the actual paper and size or sex
segregation is never made. It would be interesting if some of the results could be put in the context
of what is known about the movements of those species (e.g. those that have very large home
ranges vs residential vs transient etc).
Suggestion adopted. We share the reviewer’s interest in determining the movement of these species;
however, this line of research is currently being compiled for a subsequent manuscript. In the interest
of brevity, we have included a brief discussion of what is known on the movement of the studied
sharks in relation to the reported spatial patterns (lines 172-187).
Pg 3, line 40. This is a very large statement yet the only citation given is a technical report. Is there
anything that is peer-reviewed that also supports this?
Comment. Unfortunately, assessments of the current stock status of commercially-important sharks
taken in WA are to date only available as technical reports. I am currently working on improving the
assessments and publishing results as both technical reports and scientific papers. This MS is one of
the many sources of information used in the new generation of assessments.
Line 44. Is there a citation for this? It’s an important point Overall I am not sure if the statistics are
completely appropriate. Would generalized additive models be a better approach with the best
candidate models selected using information criteria? It also doesn’t seem that the response would
be linear for these relationships. I also wonder if latitude and longitude are the best units to use.
Would UTM be better as the values directly correspond to a distance measurement? For example,
the results all show depth to be highly significant in terms of its effect on size and sexual
segregation. Looking at the actual graphs this seems highly unlikely (and the authors seem to
acknowledge that in the discussion). E.g. only dusky and sandbar sharks show clear size segregation
with lattitude (this is a really interesting result by the way. Both figure 1 and 2 alone make this paper
worth publishing).
Suggestion adopted. We added a reference to exemplify our statement (line 45). Note that, following
Reviewer’s #1 comments on the statistical approach for understanding patterns, there are now no
concerns about non-linear relationships between predictors and response variables. As raised by
Reviewer #2, and explained in our response to Reviewer’s #2 first comment, the statistical and
biological significance of our results are clearly interpreted in the text, where we distinguish between
small-scale and large-scale patterns, which is ultimately the real novelty of our study.
We also very much appreciate Reviewer’s #1 statement ‘…Both figure 1 and 2 alone make this paper
worth publishing’.
Figure 1. There should be some reference to what the size of the bubbles translate to (in terms of
shark FL). Can a figure legend be included?
Suggestion adopted. We modified Figure 1 to include both a reference to the meaning of the relative
size of the bubble and the location of the different management zones
Figure S4 is difficult to interpret. Maybe just include data for 1 or 2 species with the sample size for
each month?
Suggestion adopted. We modified former Figure S4 to better convey the effect of inter-monthly
variability on size (current Figure S5) and sex ration (current Figure S6). Also note that Figures S1 – S4
and S7 were improved/added to better display spatial patterns are different scales.
I also feel there are additional references that could be useful. For example, changes in sex ratio with
depth have been published for tigers and sandbar sharks in Hawaii (McElroy et al. 2006 Env Biol Fish,
Papastamatiou et al. 2006, MEPS).
lines 172-187). However, an extensive discussion of specific spatial patterns in size and sex ratios for
all the species considered in our study would not be appropriate as our MS focuses on overall large-
scale spatial patterns across multiple years, which have not been reported elsewhere for most of the
species considered here.
