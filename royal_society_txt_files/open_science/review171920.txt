Specific comments:
Section 1.b
Since this is a section on "contribution", the authors should make it clearer at this point that the
system actually requires parallel data but between other pairs. For a reader who's not familiar
with zero-shot translation, the language used ("has never seen a translation between the
particular language pair") might be misunderstood as "no need for parallel data". This is
particularly important given that there's recent work on unsupervised MT (i.e. where MT systems
do not require parallel data whatsoever) just accepted to ICLR 2018 (3 papers on the topic) and
this seems to be a promising direction on which the MT community is very likely to focus.
Section 3.a
The number (33.8 million pairings) is a bit confusing. Since there's an alignment of X sentences
across all 32 books, does that mean there exists X=33.8million samples (after filtering) in each
book? Or that's the combined number of pairs across all pairs (i.e. each book appearing 31 times
to get all number of pairings) [NB: okay this is made clearer in Section 3.b, but it can still be made
a bit clearer at this point.]
Section 3.b
" "ERV" and "KJ21" were identified qualitatively as good candidates and then confirmed to be
much less similar than most versions ... " If those 2 candidates are much less similar than MOST
versions, meaning not much less similar than ALL other possible pairs, a question is why didnt
the authors use that specific pair between the 2 most dissimilar candidates? Also, why is that the
authors did not run some automatic tests to directly figure out the two most dissimilar candidates
(rather than qualitatively looking at pairs and THEN verifiying with BLEU). This seems sub-
optimal to me.
There's a stark contrast between the size of the training vs dev vs test sets. At the very least, 10
million vs 200 would raise questions... If one were to adopt one of the standard splits (e.g., 80-10-
10), we would be talking about say 8 million vs 1 million vs 1 million. I'm not sure if it's possible
to have 1 million samples from one specific pair (since this is a restriction on how the authors
want to have their training/testing done), but the size of the test set raises generalization
concerns. I suggest increasing the size of the dev and test sets.
I agree with the authors wanting to create a vocabulary that is more diverse and realistic, for
which reason they sample words from other sources such as gutenberg.org and Wikipedia.
However, for the purposes of a stylistic transfer task, the choice of these external sources does not
seem adequate to me. Texts from Wikipedia, for instance, are going to have a "style" that is very
different from a Bible version (even if that version is written in simple/modern English). Also,
the fact that the authors sample words randomly from these sources also raises concerns as to
whether some of these words are perhaps adding some noise to the learning in the case they [i.e.,
the aforementioned "some of these words"] are themselves rare words in those sources. It seems
to me more appropriate to have ordered words in those sources by frequency and then sampled
from the top N frequent words. I suggest addressing these concerns.

Section 5.b:
While I do understand why Moses was trained on 300k pairs, I cannot but note and find it highly
problematic that two models are being compared while being trained on corpora that are orders
of magnitude different in size. One way to partially address this would've been for the authors to
provide results for their model being also trained on 300k pairs. This would've showed how the
model would've performed had it been given only 300k samples.
Section 5.c:
In their qualitative analysis, the authors focus only on cases such as Me and My. It would be
interesting to highlight as well other examples/patterns that are learned by the model.
General comments:
While the dataset is actually very suitable for this approach to style transfer since there are 33
different "styles", the following is not evident: What are some other practical/useful scenarios
where such system can benefit from a large number of stylistic pairs? Can you think of other
examples of other corporas/case studies where your approach to style transfer would work well?
While the authors refer to the use of an external dictionary in [10] as some kind of limitation (e.g.
lines 127-128), the overall spirit of the work is not that different from [10] in that both works
require parallel data, which is in my opinion, the biggest limitation of looking at style transfer
from a machine translation perspective.
I don't quite see how contributions (b) and (c) are really "two contributions". You're proposing to
use an exisiting model from machine translation, namely the zero-shot MT system [11], which
uses an encoder-decoder architecture. So the latter is not really a contribution. It's just the nature
of the architrecture used in [11]. So by virtue of using the model in [11], your approach to style
transfer ends up being an encoder-decoder approach. Besides, as the authors rightfully point out,
[10] already uses an encoder-decoder architecture, so again, nothing novel in that respect.
Even more, and to be very honest, I'm not sure to what extent I can agree that contribution (b) is
actually a contribution. If anything, it's an incremental "contribution" by taking an existing model
and applying it as is (with no extension of the model whatsoever) to a different problem that
happens to be very similar in nature to the problem for which the model was presented in the
first place.
This paper would've been much more suitable as a resource paper in one of the NLP conferences
where you introduce a nice corpus and present some case study on it (in this case style transfer).
To me, it seems that the most interesting contribution of this paper is the data collection, a
contribution that is also reduced by the fact that not all the corpus can be made available; while
the style transfer aspect of the work is, as I mentioned before, a mere application of an existing
system to a new problem, so at best an incremental contribution IMHO.
Overall, I suggest rewriting the contributions to take these comments into consideration.
If I were to give my honest opinion, I would've been not able to recommend the acceptance of this
paper (with its current format/claims of contributions) to a major conference like NIPS or ACL.
However, this publication venue is neither. So I would be willing to recommend acceptance if my
questions/concerns/suggestions are addressed.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In this paper, they consider a model that can translate text from one style to another. For example,
from ‘casual’ to ‘formal’ text. It is important that such translations are well understood by the
intended user. Further, a good model must preserve the meaning of the text.
LSTM model with many layers is used for encoding and decoding. The encoder first applies a
trainable embedding layer to project each word into a 512 dimensional vector to be passed to the
LSTM. They also prepend all sentences with a tag. For example, if the style is 21st century King
James Version then the tag is < KJ21>. The model is evaluated on 32 stylistically distinct versions
of the Bible
The paper is a little confusing. Here are my specific comments:
1. Abstract, when you say translation it looks like you are talking about multiple languages. What
is the application of such a model ?
2. Pg. 4 line no 56 'never seen a translation' is very difficult to achieve
3. Pg. 4 line no 68 It is difficult to believe that there is only one paper. Some comparison with
transfer learning methods is needed
4. Pg. 5 line no104 what do you mean by' other than the target language’
5. Pg. 6 line no 152 what is the size of training data
6. Pg. 7 line no 41 why is decoder initialized with encoder. Provide a reference.
7. Why don’t you compare with other papers for ‘LSTM for text mining’? For example see
‘Augmenting end-to-end dialog systems with commonsense knowledge’, AAAI 2018,

Comments to the Author:
Two reviews have been received. After careful review, both reviewers believed that this paper
needed major revision. Comments mainly focus on two aspects: lack of novelty and confusion of
crucial techniques. After my carefully reading, I concur with the reviewers and thus my
recommendation is Major Revision. Authors should be carefully rewritten based on these
comments.

I thank the authors for taking the time to read my response and taking into account my
suggestions and concerns.
I believe the paper is now much more focused, the contributions clearer. The related work is also
now much more extensive and covers more of the recent work which has quite grown in the past
year. If you'd like to make your related work section even more complete, these are 2 relevant
papers as well:

(Disclaimer: none of these papers are mine, so I am mentioning them for self-citation.)
Overall, the paper is now more well-positioned with respect to the existing work in the area, and
it has better potential to speed up research on the problem of style transfer. I don't have any
additional revisions to request and can recommend the paper for acceptance.
Thank you for a beautifully written paper, and thanks again for the major revisions and taking
my feedback into account. I hope the paper now achieves more impact.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
I thank the authors for taking the time to read my response and taking into account my
suggestions and concerns.
I believe the paper is now much more focused, the contributions clearer. The related work is also
now much more extensive and covers more of the recent work which has quite grown in the past
year. If you'd like to make your related work section even more complete, these are 2 relevant
papers as well:
Delete, Retrieve, Generate: a Simple Approach to Sentiment and Style Transfer. NAACL 2018
Controlling Linguistic Style Aspects in Neural Language Generation (EMNLP 2017 workshop)
(Disclaimer: none of these papers are mine, so I am mentioning them for self-citation.)
Overall, the paper is now more well-positioned with respect to the existing work in the area, and
it has better potential to speed up research on the problem of style transfer. I don't have any
additional revisions to request and can recommend the paper for acceptance.
Thank you for a beautifully written paper, and thanks again for the major revisions and taking
my feedback into account. I hope the paper now achieves more impact.

r Editors and Reviewers,
Thank you for taking the time to read our paper “Zero-Shot Style Transfer in Text Using
urrent Neural Networks”. Your questions and comments were very useful in helping us to
erstand where our work fit in with existing research and what we could contribute. Some major
sions were suggested and mostly focused on clarifying some details about the data, methods, and
lts and on identifying and focusing on the parts of our work which were novel and would spur on
re research. We agree strongly with this second point and have renamed our paper “Evaluating
e Style Transfer with the Bible”.
We focus now on the presentation and importance of the Bible dataset as a significant resource
benchmarking dataset for the style transfer problem. We have added 2 more public versions and
ide standard splits into training, testing, and development data. We have dropped our focus on the
o-Shot” task and instead view the models we train as serving 2 purposes. First, they show that the
e corpus and the publicly available splits of the data which we provide are suitable for training
els towards the task of prose style transfer. Second, they serve as baseline results for future work
ch makes use of our corpus. To these ends we now train many Seq2Seq models and many Moses
els using different data and evaluate their performance on a variety of test sets.
As we now discuss in the paper, no existing corpus which is used for prose style transfer is as
suited to the task as the Bible data. We hope you’ll agree that this corpus fills a significant gap in
ent research on prose style transfer and that its publication will accelerate research in the field.
Thank you again for your time and attention. We have responded to the individual comments
questions from the reviewers below.

Response to the Comments of Reviewer 1:
iewer 1 Comment: Section 1.b. Since this is a section on "contribution", the authors should make it
rer at this point that the system actually requires parallel data but between other pairs. For a reader
's not familiar with zero-shot translation, the language used ("has never seen a translation between
particular language pair") might be misunderstood as "no need for parallel data". This is particularly
ortant given that there's recent work on unsupervised MT (i.e. where MT systems do not require
llel data whatsoever) just accepted to ICLR 2018 (3 papers on the topic) and this seems to be a
mising direction on which the MT community is very likely to focus.
ponse: We have dropped the “zero-shot” language and made the definition of the task clearer. We
mention unlabeled machine translation and style transfer and how we believe our work fits in to
picture.
iewer 1 Comment Section 3.a. The number (33.8 million pairings) is a bit confusing. Since there's an
nment of X sentences across all 32 books, does that mean there exists X=33.8million samples (after
ring) in each book? Or that's the combined number of pairs across all pairs (i.e. each book appearing
imes to get all number of pairings) [NB: okay this is made clearer in Section 3.b, but it can still be
e a bit clearer at this point.]
ponse: We have removed the initial reference that the reviewer found confusing.
iewer 1 Comment Section 3.b. "ERV" and "KJ21" were identified qualitatively as good candidates
then confirmed to be much less similar than most versions ... " If those 2 candidates are much less
lar than MOST versions, meaning not much less similar than ALL other possible pairs, a question is
didnt the authors use that specific pair between the 2 most dissimilar candidates? Also, why is that
authors did not run some automatic tests to directly figure out the two most dissimilar candidates
her than qualitatively looking at pairs and THEN verifiying with BLEU). This seems sub-optimal to me.
ponse: We now use the BBE and ASV Bible versions as targets and justify our choice. Translating into
style of the BBE is, judging by our BLEU-based similarity scores, the hardest task (YLT<U+2192>BBE has the
est BLEU score of any reference<U+2192>target pair). Translating into the style of the ASV is, by contrast,
least difficult (KJV<U+2192>ASV has the highest BLEU score of any reference<U+2192>target pair). Using these two
ets in evaluation will allow researchers to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different
ems. For example, one system might excel at performing prose style transfer for highly similar texts
reas another system might excel at doing style transfer between stylistically different texts.
iewer 1 Comment Section 3.b. There's a stark contrast between the size of the training vs dev vs
sets. At the very least, 10 million vs 200 would raise questions... If one were to adopt one of the
dard splits (e.g., 80-10-10), we would be talking about say 8 million vs 1 million vs 1 million. I’m not
if it's possible to have 1 million samples from one specific pair (since this is a restriction on how the
ors want to have their training/testing done), but the size of the test set raises generalization
cerns. I suggest increasing the size of the dev and test sets.
ponse: We now use full books as testing and development data so they represent a much larger
ion of our data. Additionally we provide splits of the data into testing, training, and development so
future research can use and compare to the same data.
iewer 1 Comment Section 3.b. I agree with the authors wanting to create a vocabulary that is more
rse and realistic, for which reason they sample words from other sources such as gutenberg.org and
ipedia. However, for the purposes of a stylistic transfer task, the choice of these external sources
s not seem adequate to me. Texts from Wikipedia, for instance, are going to have a "style" that is
different from a Bible version (even if that version is written in simple/modern English). Also, the
that the authors sample words randomly from these sources also raises concerns as to whether
e of these words are perhaps adding some noise to the learning in the case they [i.e., the
ementioned "some of these words"] are themselves rare words in those sources. It seems to me
e appropriate to have ordered words in those sources by frequency and then sampled from the top
equent words. I suggest addressing these concerns.
ponse: To simplify our process we now build a vocabulary simply out of the training data from all of
Bible versions. While more complex vocabularies may yield slightly different results, we are now
sed on simply showing that the data is suitable for this task. The vocabulary built using Bible
ions is sufficient for this and does not distract from the contributions of this paper in the way that
ussion of a more complex method of building the vocabulary would.
iewer 1 Comment Section 5.b. While I do understand why Moses was trained on 300k pairs, I
not but note and find it highly problematic that two models are being compared while being trained
orpora that are orders of magnitude different in size. One way to partially address this would've
n for the authors to provide results for their model being also trained on 300k pairs. This would've
wed how the model would've performed had it been given only 300k samples.
ponse: We agree that a more thorough comparison of seq2seq and Moses was needed. In the
inal paper we train only 1 Moses model and 1 seq2seq model. Now that we have re-framed our
lts as a dataset and initial evaluation of existing methods, we train 4 different seq2seq models and 5
rent Moses models on various pairings of the data. We report the best performing model of each
on the 5 evaluation tasks in the paper, and report the results of all models on all evaluation tasks in
github repository.
iewer 1 Comment Section 5.c. In their qualitative analysis, the authors focus only on cases such as
and My. It would be interesting to highlight as well other examples/patterns that are learned by the
el.
ponse: Since we have focused now on the Bible corpus as a public resource, we try to highlight
lts which use the data we are able to make public. This use of Me/me and My/my is not present in
of the public versions and so we do not include this discussion. We add some examples to showcase
stic features that the models are able to successfully translate, and one that Moses fails on. In
eral we feel that the focus of this work is no longer the performance of any of our models, but on
showcasing that the data is appropriate for this task and establishing some baselines. We believe
examples now included are sufficient for this goal.
iewer 1 Comment General comments. While the dataset is actually very suitable for this approach to
e transfer since there are 33 different "styles", the following is not evident: What are some other
tical/useful scenarios where such system can benefit from a large number of stylistic pairs? Can you
k of other examples of other corporas/case studies where your approach to style transfer would
k well? While the authors refer to the use of an external dictionary in [10] as some kind of limitation
. lines 127-128), the overall spirit of the work is not that different from [10] in that both works
ire parallel data, which is in my opinion, the biggest limitation of looking at style transfer from a
hine translation perspective. I don't quite see how contributions (b) and (c) are really "two
tributions". You're proposing to use an exisiting model from machine translation, namely the zero-
MT system [11], which uses an encoder-decoder architecture. So the latter is not really a
tribution. It's just the nature of the architrecture used in [11]. So by virtue of using the model in [11],
r approach to style transfer ends up being an encoder-decoder approach. Besides, as the authors
tfully point out, [10] already uses an encoder-decoder architecture, so again, nothing novel in that
ect. Even more, and to be very honest, I'm not sure to what extent I can agree that contribution (b)
tually a contribution. If anything, it's an incremental "contribution" by taking an existing model and
ying it as is (with no extension of the model whatsoever) to a different problem that happens to be
similar in nature to the problem for which the model was presented in the first place. This paper
ld've been much more suitable as a resource paper in one of the NLP conferences where you
oduce a nice corpus and present some case study on it (in this case style transfer). To me, it seems
the most interesting contribution of this paper is the data collection, a contribution that is also
ced by the fact that not all the corpus can be made available; while the style transfer aspect of the
k is, as I mentioned before, a mere application of an existing system to a new problem, so at best an
emental contribution IMHO. Overall, I suggest rewriting the contributions to take these comments
consideration. If I were to give my honest opinion, I would've been not able to recommend the
ptance of this paper (with its current format/claims of contributions) to a major conference like
or ACL. However, this publication venue is neither. So I would be willing to recommend acceptance
y questions/concerns/suggestions are addressed.
ponse: We have taken the comments of Reviewer 1 to heart and revised the paper to reflect thei
estions. We claim, specifically, that parallel corpora will invariably be required for the _evaluation_
rose style transfer systems. Parallel corpora may or may not be required for the training of such
ems. We’ve removed the language that suggests a second contribution and instead focus on
ribing the contribution of the corpus and the evaluation of existing techniques with respect to the
us.
iewer 1 Comment Typos: lines 13-15 - sentence "The translations ... audience": there's some word
ing in the first part of the sentence (and other language generated a natural language system) line
the references are swapped -> The shakespeare dataset [9] ... Seq2Seq model [10]. line 227: The
es translation system [38] *that* is .... (alternatively: ... *and* serves ...)
ponse: Indicated typos have been fixed.
Response to the Comments from Reviewer 2:
iewer 2 Comment (points 1-4): 1. Abstract, when you say translation it looks like you are talking
ut multiple languages. What is the application of such a model ? 2. Pg. 4 line no 56 'never seen a
slation' is very difficult to achieve 3. Pg. 4 line no 68 It is difficult to believe that there is only one
er. Some comparison with transfer learning methods is needed 4. Pg. 5 line no104 what do you
n by' other than the target language’
ponse (Addressing Reviewer 2 points 1-4.): The abstract and paper have been revised to focus on
corpus and the task of evaluation (see responses to Reviewer 1’s general comments). The revisions
e clarified the task. We believe the task is now described in sufficient detail that readers will not
use the task with the task of translating between modern languages.
iewer 2 Comment: 5. Pg. 6 line no 152 what is the size of training data
ponse: The size of the training, test, and validation datasets are now described.
iewer 2 Comment: 6. Pg. 7 line no 41 why is decoder initialized with encoder. Provide a reference.
ponse: We adopt existing practices from previously published research here. The contribution of the
er is not a new model but rather a framework and corpus for evaluation. This specific choice is made
ply because it is a default option in the seq2seq library which we use.
iewer 2 Comment: 7. Why don’t you compare with other papers for ‘LSTM for text mining’? For
mple see ‘ Augmenting end-to-end dialog systems with commonsense knowledge’, AAAI 2018,
ponse: As our references indicate, there is considerable existing research on this specific task and
hboring tasks. Dialog systems are, we believe, a completely different domain.

r Editors and Reviewers,
Thank you for taking the time to read and revise our paper “Evaluating Prose Style Transfer with
Bible” and for the helpful comments. We are pleased that it has been accepted for publication.
The latest round of comments recommended adding references to three more papers to
eve more complete coverage of appropriate related work. “Delete, Retrieve, Generate: a Simple
roach to Sentiment and Style Transfer” and “Controlling Linguistic Style Aspects in Neural Language
eration” were highly relevant and we added references to them and made a small textual change in
3rd paragraph of the introduction.
The third paper, “Augmenting end-to-end dialog systems with commonsense knowledge” did
fit as clearly into our work. This paper describes a way to use an externally built commonsense
wledge base to improve a system’s performance when trying to determine whether a given sentence
ely to follow another in dialogue. The output of the system is a score for the provided context and
onse pair. Since this work does not focus on the style of text and does not itself generate text, we
not feel that a citation to it fit naturally into our manuscript and have not referenced it, but if the
ors feel strongly about its inclusion we will mention it.
Thank you again for all your work on this manuscript. We feel that it is a stronger paper than it
in its original form and we recognize that your hard work and insight throughout this process were
mportant part of this improvement. We look forward to seeing our paper in your journal.
