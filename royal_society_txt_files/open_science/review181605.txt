This is an excellent review on the preparation of wafer-scale CNT films and some examples of
applications of these films. The manuscript is already well prepared. But for the completeness, I
would suggest the following few new papers for the consideration of the authors. (1) Jiantao
3
Wang et al., Nature Catalysis, (2018) DOI:10.1038/s41929-018-0057-x, Growing highly pure
semiconducting carbon nanotubes by electrotwisting the helicity; (2) Jia Si et al., ACS Nano 2018,
12:627-634, Scalable preparation of high density semiconducting carbon nanotube arrays for high
performance field-effect transistors; (3) M. Zhu et al., Adv. Mater. 2018, 30:1707068, Aligning
solution-derived carbon nanotube film with full surface coverage for high performance
electronics applications. These methjods are somehow different from usual chemical methods,
and may potentially be used for digital electronics.
While it is has been demonstrated in the manuscript several photonics and optoelectronics
applications, I would be more interested to see some discussions on potential application of the
CNT films in digital electronics. It is true that films with different thickness can be obtained, but
what is the low limit of the thickness. The most interesting case would be a monolayer CNTs,
with somehow large spacing between them than those demonstrated in the paper. Can we
control the tube-tune junction in this case, from e.g. 5-10 nm? I know it is difficult, and I do not
insist the authors to answer these questions.

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
---------------------------------------------------------
Response to Reviewer #1
---------------------------------------------------------
Reviewer #1’s comment #1: The authors should further discuss the challenge of wafer-scale
crystalline carbon nanotube films prepared through controlled vacuum filtration.
Response to comment #1: We agree with the reviewer that we should mention the challenges
we have for producing wafer-scale crystalline carbon nanotube films. Specifically, one of the
challenges is that our method requires extensive tip sonication to reduce the carbon nanotube
length and increase the stiffness for optimal alignment quality, because kinks, joints, and defects
in long tubes make them vulnerable to bending and twisting in the dispersion. Also, it still
remains a challenge to use the controlled vacuum filtration technique to produce a monolayer
film of aligned carbon nanotubes with a controllable tube spacing, required for high-
performance electronics. In the conclusion section (now conclusion and challenges) of the
revised manuscript, we have added a new paragraph discussing these two challenges.
Reviewer #1’s comment #2: The relevant literatures about carbon nanotube films are suggested
to be referred to, such as Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, v 258, p 895-905, 2018; Journal
of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics, v 26, n 10, p 7445-7451, 2015; Microsystem
Technologies, v 20, n 3, p 379-385, 2014; Microsystem Technologies, v 19, n 7, p 1041-1047,
2013; Sensors and Actuators A: Physical, v 185, p 101-108, 2012.
Response to comment #2: The papers mentioned by the reviewer focus on composite films,
which include carbon nanotubes and other materials, and their potential applications in
nano/micro-electro-mechanical systems and gas/liquid sensors. Although these composite films
and applications digress from the main topic of this review, we agree with the referee that it
would be worthwhile mentioning some of these papers in the introduction. At the end of the 5th
paragraph of subsection (a) in the introduction part of the revised manuscript, we have
added a sentence mentioning these two potential applications and two selected papers
(Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics, v 26, n 10, p 7445-7451, 2015 and
Sensors and Actuators A: Physical, v 185, p 101-108, 2012) in the reference.
---------------------------------------------------------
Response to Reviewer #2
---------------------------------------------------------
Reviewer #2’s comment #1: But for the completeness, I would suggest the following few new
papers for the consideration of the authors. (1) Jiantao Wang et al., Nature Catalysis, (2018)
DOI:10.1038/s41929-018-0057-x, Growing highly pure semiconducting carbon nanotubes by
electrotwisting the helicity; (2) Jia Si et al., ACS Nano 2018, 12:627-634, Scalable preparation
of high density semiconducting carbon nanotube arrays for high performance field-effect
transistors; (3) M. Zhu et al., Adv. Mater. 2018, 30:1707068, Aligning solution-derived carbon
nanotube film with full surface coverage for high performance electronics applications. These
methjods are somehow different from usual chemical methods, and may potentially be used for
digital electronics.
Response to comment #1: We thank the reviewer for bringing our attention to these recent
papers. We agree that these papers represent important recent progress in preparing aligned
semiconducting (but not single-chirality) carbon nanotubes, especially for high-performance
electronics applications. The first paper (Nature Catalysis, (2018) DOI:10.1038/s41929-018-
0057-x) describes a method of controlling the polarity of catalyst particle charge using an
external electric field to twist the chirality of carbon nanotubes from metallic to semiconducting
during a chemical vapor deposition process. The second (ACS Nano 2018, 12:627-634) and
third (Adv. Mater. 2018, 30:1707068) papers present a straightforward method of directional
shrinking transfer to increase the packing density in aligned carbon nanotubes and decrease the
angle deviation in randomly oriented carbon nanotubes for creating partially aligned carbon
nanotube films. In the revised manuscript, we have added all three papers in the reference.
In addition, we have added one sentence describing the first paper in the 3rd paragraph of
subsection (b) in the introduction part of the revised manuscript. We have also added
several sentences in the 5th paragraph and one subfigure in Figure (4) to discuss the second
and third papers.
Reviewer #2’s comment #2: While it is has been demonstrated in the manuscript several
photonics and optoelectronics applications, I would be more interested to see some discussions
on potential application of the CNT films in digital electronics. It is true that films with different
thickness can be obtained, but what is the low limit of the thickness. The most interesting case
would be a monolayer CNTs, with somehow large spacing between them than those
demonstrated in the paper. Can we control the tube-tune junction in this case, from e.g. 5-10 nm?
I know it is difficult, and I do not insist the authors to answer these questions.
Response to comment #2: We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment. The achieved
lowest limit of the film thickness is ~5 nm, and it still cannot be treated as a monolayer film of
carbon nanotubes with typical diameter ~1 nm. We agree with the reviewer that monolayer
films with medium spacing (not dense packing) would be ideal for high-performance electronics,
but it is challenging to obtain such films using our controlled vacuum filtration technique.
Instead, controlled vacuum filtration is more suitable for producing reasonably thick and
densely packed films for photonic and optoelectronic applications, which is the main topic of
this review. In addition, in order to have an optimal alignment quality, extensive tip sonication
has to be employed to reduce the CNT length and increase the stiffness, because kinks, joints,
and defects on long tubes make them vulnerable to bending and twisting in dispersion. These
short tubes in assembled aligned films introduce a number of tube-tube junctions, which
dominate and limit the transport performance of electronic devices. Thus, potential electronic
applications based on films prepared by controlled vacuum filtration could be limited. In the
conclusion section (now conclusion and challenges) of the revised manuscript, we have
added a new paragraph further discussing the challenges of our vacuum filtration
technique and providing possible ways of addressing these challenges, especially from the
perspective of electronic applications.

Changes Made
---------------------------------------------------------
4th page, 1st paragraph, last sentence
Added: CNTs can also form composites with other materials, such as organic polymers and
inorganic nanorods, to reinforce polymer mechanical properties for nano/micro-electro-
mechanical systems [26] and build sensitive gas sensors [27].
5th page, 4th paragraph, 3rd sentence
Previous: Recently, there have been breakthroughs in precisely controlling chirality distribution
during synthesis, by designing a catalyst that matches the carbon atom arrangement around the
nanotube circumference of a specific chirality [37-39].
Current: Recently, there have been breakthroughs in precisely controlling chirality distribution
during synthesis, by designing a catalyst that matches the carbon atom arrangement around the
nanotube circumference of a specific chirality [37-39] or applying an external electric field to
control the polarity of catalyst charge for changing the chirality from metallic to semiconducting
[40].
5th page, 6th paragraph, 2nd sentence
Added: Metallic CNTs in horizontally aligned CNTs prepared using epitaxy CVD growth can
be selectively removed, leaving an array of high-purity semiconducting CNTs [52]. However,
the packing density is as low as 3 CNTs/µm. A simple directional shrinkage method can
compress films to amplify the packing density (Figure 4(b)) [53]. Although this level of low
packing density is desirable for high-performance electronics applications, such densities are
still too low for photonic and optoelectronic applications. The same technique can be applied to
randomly oriented CNT films to reduce the angle deviation for preparing partially aligned films
[54].
Figure 4
Added: Added a new subfigure, Figure 4(b), and modified the caption correspondingly.
19th – 20th page, final paragraph
Added: The future direction of improving the controlled vacuum filtration technique can focus
on addressing challenges in the current process. In order to have an optimal alignment quality,
extensive tip sonication has to be employed to reduce the CNT length and increase the stiffness,
because kinks, joints, and defects in long tubes make them vulnerable to bending and twisting in
dispersions [114,115]. These short tubes in assembled aligned films introduce a number of tube-
tube junctions, which dominate and limit the transport performance of electronic devices. One
direction is to explore different dispersion solvents for preserving long tubes with increased
stiffness, and search for different surface chemistry of filter membranes and optimal filtration
condition due to altered colloidal properties of dispersed CNTs. Furthermore, although the
thickness of obtained films prepared using controlled vacuum filtration can range from a few
nanometers to a few microns, it is challenging to prepare monolayer films of aligned CNTs with
adjustable spacing, which are ideal for high-performance electronics applications. One possible
way of solving this issue is to reduce the thickness through layer-by-layer etching.
