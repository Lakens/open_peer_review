Review form: Reviewer 1
Is the manuscript scientifically sound in its present form?
Yes
Are the interpretations and conclusions justified by the results?
Yes
Is the language acceptable?
Yes
Is it clear how to access all supporting data?
The manuscripts simply states that data are available on request. But the policy states, 'Datasets
should be deposited in an appropriate, recognized, publicly available repository.' However, the
PAM data used here are probably to big to deposit, and the processed data are already present in
Table 1, so I am not sure what makes sense here; I guess it's probably fine as it is. I'll leave it to the
editors of the journal to judge.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
This revised paper is very streamlined and clearly written, and I think the authors have dealt
appropriately with all my comments on a previous version. I recommend its acceptance for
publication.
Comment for minor revision:
Table 2: It took me a bit to get my brain in gear and figure out that the betas and B's in the
regression summary were unstandardised and standardised regression coefficients. I don't see
the standardised ones presented very often. It might be helpful to explain what they are
explicitly in the figure legend (or just remove the standardised one from the report if they aren't
going to be discussed). Perhaps B/beta are standard notation according to the RS statistical good
practise document - if so of course ignore this comment. (I tried to check but the link to the doc
was broken).

Dear Miss Indeck
On behalf of the Editor, I am pleased to inform you that your Manuscript RSOS-150337 entitled
"A severe red tide (Tampa Bay, 2005) causes an anomalous decrease in biological sound" has been
accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science subject to minor revision in accordance
with the referee suggestions. Please find the referees' comments at the end of this email.
The reviewers and Subject Editor have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript.

• Data accessibility
It is a condition of publication that all supporting data are made available either as
supplementary information or preferably in a suitable permanent repository. The data
3
accessibility section should state where the article's supporting data can be accessed. This section
should also include details, where possible of where to access other relevant research materials
such as statistical tools, protocols, software etc can be accessed. If the data has been deposited in
an external repository this section should list the database, accession number and link to the DOI
for all data from the article that has been made publicly available. Data sets that have been
deposited in an external repository and have a DOI should also be appropriately cited in the

Please declare any financial or non-financial competing interests, or state that you have no

should meet all of the following criteria; 1) substantial contributions to conception and design, or
acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it
critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be published.
All contributors who do not meet all of these criteria should be included in the
acknowledgements.
We suggest the following format:
AB carried out the molecular lab work, participated in data analysis, carried out sequence
alignments, participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript; CD carried out
the statistical analyses; EF collected field data; GH conceived of the study, designed the study,
coordinated the study and helped draft the manuscript. All authors gave final approval for
publication.
• Acknowledgements
Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship
criteria.
• Funding statement
Please list the source of funding for each author.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit

think you will be able to meet this date please let me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
4
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) Included your supplementary files in a format you are happy with (no line numbers,
vancouver referencing, track changes removed etc) as these files will NOT be edited in
production
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.
Best wishes

Referee Comment for Minor Revision:
Table 2: It took me a bit to get my brain in gear and figure out that the betas and B's in the
regression summary were unstandardised and standardised regression coefficients. I don't
see the standardised ones presented very often. It might be helpful to explain what they
are explicitly in the figure legend (or just remove the standardised one from the report if
they aren't going to be discussed). Perhaps B/beta are standard notation according to the
RS statistical good practise document - if so of course ignore this comment. (I tried to check
but the link to the doc was broken).
Response:
As suggested by the referee, we now explain in the table legend that the Betas and B’s are
standardised and unstandardised values, respectively.
