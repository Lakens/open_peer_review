Review of: “Adaptive phenotypic reponse to climate change enabled by epigenetics in a K-
strategy species, the fish Leucoraja ocellata (Rajidae).” – Lighten et al., 2016
The authors compose a cohesive and well-constructed story with their findings. They clearly
show the morphological differences between two distinct populations of skate and identify
epigenetic changes associated with these morphological traits, providing strong support for their
hypothesis; Leucoraja ocellata have the potential to adapt to rapidly changing environments
through epigenetic mechanisms. They identify many up- and down-regulated genes that directly
and indirectly impact temperature stress response, morphology, and life history traits. They
highlight the clear differences in the two populations: maturation time, egg case size, lifespan,
body size, among other morphological characteristics.
While the article has technical components in terms of the genetic tools and techniques used, the
authors were able to communicate their results and the significance of their findings without
difficulty. Valuable connections are drawn to link the genetic components to physiological,
ecological, and behavioural mechanisms that strengthen their findings, drawing from
fundamental literature to support their findings and linking it to recent literature for relevance in
today’s changing climate. They provide a comprehensive list of explanations for changes in gene
expression to support their findings. The authors also draw connections to social components,
with the species vulnerable to fishing activities as by-catch. This article will be a novel and
valuable addition to the current scientific literature. The following comments should be
addressed:
1. Page 4, second paragraph. You indicate that natural epigenetic changes to climate change
have not been identified in fish populations. Is there other literature on land and non-fish species
that show these epigenetic changes?
2. Page 6, second paragraph. It appears that the sample size was 2. While this may be
appropriate for this type of genetic study, you should address the variance and uncertainty in the
results with this study design. What are the implications of pseudoreplication when sampling
from the same individual?
3. Page 12-13, last paragraph. The authors indicate changes in growth between populations.
Is it growth (rate) that is different between the two environments, or max size? Table 1 does not
summarize difference in growth rate.
4. Page 13, second paragraph, last sentence. The authors can specify how oxidative stress
affects organismal aging (increase aging).
5. Page 14, first paragraph, last sentence. The authors should provide a citation for this
statement.
6. This study identifies the adaptive changes in gene expression to different climates.
However, in the title and throughout the article, climate change is introduced as a component
leading to epigenetic differences. Climate change is different than the environmental differences
between these two populations. Instead, the authors should clearly state the implications of your
3
study to climate change. The title is also misleading as it suggests that these species have already
shown epigenetic responses to climate change.
7. The study supports epigenetic adaptation across relatively short time scales. The authors
may want to consider the implications of their study and the fact that chondrichthyes, in general,
having persisted relatively evolutionary unchanged through many eras and through vast changes
in climate (e.g., ice ages).
8. It would be useful to include a table to explain the linkages of the specific epigenetic
responses (up/down regulation of a certain process) mean to the adaptation to environmental
changes. It is not apparent in the manuscript. As the manuscript aims to build such linkages, it
would be helpful for readers if the author could include such a table e.g., the first column is the
process, second column as up/down regulation or no change, and then final column as inferred
links to adaptation to climate.
The following minor changes to be addressed:
9. Page 5, line 121. Consider changing “K-strategy” to “K-strategist”.
10. Page 6, line 173. Grammar: “manufactures” to “manufacturer’s”.
11. Page 9, line 262. Grammar: “an 95%” to “a 95%”.
12. Page 11, line 311. Spelling: “exposer” to “exposure”.
13. Page 21, figure 1. Identify study sites on map. This is an integral component to your
study, showing the geographical and environmental differences between the populations.
14. Page 22-23, figure 2. This figure is not properly labelled and referenced in text.

The manuscript reports results from a study comparing transcriptomes of two populations of the
winter skates. The topic is timely and the protocols appear to be executed appropriately. The
scope of the study is somewhat limited to two populations, and I do not quite understand why
the study was not extended to investigate also other, more southern, populations.
Most importantly, the authors need to clarify the collection methods, and they need to include a
broader reference to the literature on the effect of temperature on skates in light of climate change
beyond the fisheries studies.
I recommend that these issues are addressed in a revision.
Minor comments and suggestions:
L.52: “factor” instead of condition
L.57: some species shrunk their range, i.e. didn’t shift towards higher latitudes, but they rather
lost the southern population
L.60-61: I’m confused. If you’re talking about plastic physiological responses it is not
“adaptation” but “acclimation”, please clarify.
L.63-65: rephrase this whole sentence, it’s awkward.
Line 74 and on.. : if you are talking about phenotypic plasticity, then I think you need to report
also physiological studies (see general comments).
L.121,280,291: “elasmobranchs” misspelled
L.123 and on: perhaps because many species of skates don’t seem to travel very far?
L.150: how did you collect? Could the collection methods have affected gene expression? How
many skates? And at which temperature?
L.287-289: rephrase, some of the wording -I think- is not so appropriate for a paper.
L.302: need to explain these effects – expand this paragraph
L.375 “affect”

Dear authors,
Although the manuscript could have potential, in its current form it is incomprehensible to the
wider audience. Although it is possible that it can be understood by scientists who already have a
fairly extensive knowledge on (epi)genetics, this would not be the case for a majority of readers.
The Introduction and Discussion sections can be fairly well understood, but there is no good
connect with the (highly technical) Methods and Results sections. The key findings cannot be
grasped. The key findings seem to be mentioned in Discussion, lines 289-293 ("Our study
suggests that a phenotypically plastic response through epigenetic regulation ... take place over
time." However, it remains unclear how the actual results section really supports this. The
Methods and Results sections require significant clarification. - The figures are also of insufficient
quality (e.g., the map in Fig. 1 should have the names of places referred to in text included - the
reader cannot be expected to look up in an atlas to check where Northumberland Strait is). It is,
moreover, important to realise that, although during summer the shallow southern Gulf of St
Lawrence is warmer than the open Bay of Fundy, the reverse is true during winter. At least this
point - which might interfere with the hypothesis to be tested - needs to be acknowledged. -
Although the hypothesis on epigenetics is interesting and potentially widely relevant, the paper,
as is, does not allow the typical reader of Royal Society Open Science to understand whether the
results presented actually do, or do not, support it. Significantly improved presentation is
needed, where the authors should focus to make this article more reader-friendly.
Specific points:
Simplify wherever possible throughout document - e.g. 7000 years ago (instead 7ka); avoid
introducing difficult terms if used once or twice only (e.g. 'epigenetic augmentation').
Line 54 simplify; warmer temperatures mean higher oxygen demand due to higher metabolism,
and lower oxygen levels in water. Note that oxygen levels also tend to be lower deeper down in
the ocean.
Line 95. Reference (17) appears to be about mammals, not about marine fish that can very quickly
switch genes on or off (?)
Line 117. These references (17,18) appear incorrect.
Line 151. Correct explanation DFO.
Line 156. Probably some mnore information on Eurofins MWG needed (e.g. location, what sort of
company it is).
Lines 177-236. I could not comment on these sections owing to the technical nature, but would
suggest to go through this and make this more easily accessible to wider readership. The broad
readership should be able to get a feel, although not necessarily understand the detail.
Line 258 the reference to table S1 seems incorrect (I could not find this table in suppl. mat.).
Likewise, the figures 68.6% and 70.5% could not be found anywhere in suppl. mat.
Line 252, this did not seem supported by figure S2a-b. There was no caption for figure S2a-b (or c
or d).
Lines 268-277: I could not understand this (and would worry that most potential readers would
neither). Does this support adaptive phenotypic plasticity?
Lines 272. I could not see how this statement was supported by figures 3-5 (which were lacking a
caption).
Lines 280-288. This is introductory text, and does not seem to fit at a start of discussion.
Lines 289-293. It is not clear how this message is derived from the results. The results are stated
too technically and this conclusion is not evident.
Lines 297-300. please clarify.
P.S. recommend to do a better spelling check; for example, this single sentence (caption of table
S2) contains 4 spelling mistakes: "Statistcs of de novo transcripome assembly for the southern
Gulf of St. Lawrnece (sGSL) and Scotian Shelf Winter Skate (Leucoraja ocellata) compared to
6
statistics from the published transcriptome of the closely relataed Little Skate (Leucoraja

iew of: “Adaptive phenotypic response to climate change enabled by epigenetics in a K-strategy
cies, the fish Leucoraja ocellata (Rajidae).” – Lighten et al., 2016
authors compose a cohesive and well-constructed story with their findings. They clearly show the
rphological differences between two distinct populations of skate and identify epigenetic changes
ociated with these morphological traits, providing strong support for their hypothesis; Leucoraja
llata have the potential to adapt to rapidly changing environments through epigenetic mechanisms.
y identify many up- and down-regulated genes that directly and indirectly impact temperature stress
ponse, morphology, and life history traits. They highlight the clear differences in the two populations:
uration time, egg case size, lifespan, body size, among other morphological characteristics.
ile the article has technical components in terms of the genetic tools and techniques used, the
hors were able to communicate their results and the significance of their findings without difficulty.
uable connections are drawn to link the genetic components to physiological, ecological, and
avioural mechanisms that strengthen their findings, drawing from fundamental literature to support
r findings and linking it to recent literature for relevance in today’s changing climate. They provide a
prehensive list of explanations for changes in gene expression to support their findings. The authors
draw connections to social components, with the species vulnerable to fishing activities as by-catch.
article will be a novel and valuable addition to the current scientific literature.
ank you very much for your positive comments and interest.
following comments should be addressed:
age 4, second paragraph. You indicate that natural epigenetic changes to climate change have not
n identified in fish populations. Is there other literature on land and non-fish species that show these
enetic changes?
important point. Epigenetic studies on wild populations are very rare as generally isogenic
erimental lines are used. However we included a reference to a very recent study that showed
enetic mechanisms operating in wild caught mammals, albeit still though experimental
nipulation. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, our study provided the first comprehensive analysis
pigenetic adaptation of fish in the natural environment.
xperimental studies using wild caught guinea pigs have even shown that inheritance of epigenetic
difications may be important in determining the survival of mammalian species during increased
ironmental warming (22)”
age 6, second paragraph. It appears that the sample size was 2. While this may be appropriate for
type of genetic study, you should address the variance and uncertainty in the results with this study
ign. What are the implications of pseudoreplication when sampling from the same individual?
e agree this is an important point we initially did not clarify. We have now included a second
agraph to the Discussion section “Regulation of gene expression”, as follows:
ethodologically speaking, although we included four samples of Winter Skate in transcriptome
racterization, by pooling a male and a female per population we effective sequenced two biological
icates. For such RNA-Seq experiments, random variation in gene expression patterns may be very
ll, with highly correlated estimates of sequence fold-change expression between biological
icates (e.g. >0.99 (65)). However, a recent study has shown that increasing biological replicates also
eases the power in detecting differentially expressed transcripts in RNA-Seq studies (66). Therefore,
ough we are confident in our estimates of differential transcript expression, we also acknowledge
t more biological replicates across populations -and additional gene expression detection methods
bisulfite sequencing to characterize patterns of DNA methylation- would be advantageous for a
er description of Winter Skate epigenetic adaptation.”
age 12-13, last paragraph. The authors indicate changes in growth between populations. Is it growth
e) that is different between the two environments, or max size? Table 1 does not summarize
erence in growth rate.
ank you for highlighting this potentially valuable metric. In the introduction we now include the
vant information from an already cited study that showed no significant difference in growth rate
ween the two populations of skate
114. “Previous studies have shown that individuals in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (sGSL)
ulation appear to be an undescribed endemic, which are substantially divergent from the Scotian
lf population in morphology (e.g. significantly smaller body size despite no significant difference in
wth rate)…”
age 13, second paragraph, last sentence. The authors can specify how oxidative stress affects
anismal aging (increase aging).
w clarified “Oxidative stress is known to effect organismal aging by disrupting processes of glucose
ake and lipid synthesis at the cellular level (57, 58)…”
age 14, first paragraph, last sentence. The authors should provide a citation for this statement.

his study identifies the adaptive changes in gene expression to different climates. However, in the
and throughout the article, climate change is introduced as a component leading to epigenetic
erences. Climate change is different than the environmental differences between these two
ulations. Instead, the authors should clearly state the implications of your study to climate change.
title is also misleading as it suggests that these species have already shown epigenetic responses to

ank you for pointing out this out and we agree. We have now altered the title from including

ironmental variability and emphasize the implications under climate change scenarios.

would be useful to include a table to explain the linkages of the specific epigenetic responses

arent in the manuscript. As the manuscript aims to build such linkages, it would be helpful for
ders if the author could include such a table e.g., the first column is the process, second column as
down regulation or no change, and then final column as inferred links to adaptation to climate.

manuscript reports results from a study comparing transcriptomes of two populations of the winter
tes. The topic is timely and the protocols appear to be executed appropriately. The scope of the
dy is somewhat limited to two populations, and I do not quite understand why the study was not
ended to investigate also other, more southern, populations.
e study was funded by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada to determine the ecological
us of skates at risk in Canadian waters. The central question was “how is the southern Gulf
ulation of skate different from the Scotian shelf population”. Given our findings we agree that it
uld be very interesting to look at range wide variation in gene expression of skates that inhabit
erent environments, which was unfortunately outside of the scope of this study. Hopefully we
vide impetus for other researchers to take this approach and have suggested this may be valuable in
er to understand skate evolution and conservation.
st importantly, the authors need to clarify the collection methods,
e have now clarified that live skate were sampled from trawling at particular depths
they need to include a broader reference to the literature on the effect of temperature on skates in
t of climate change beyond the fisheries studies.
e direct effect of climate change on skates, beyond fisheries studies (i.e. range size shifts etc.), is
emely poorly understood. We have included a few additional citations that relate to the effect of
perature on reproductive traits, and growth. Beyond these, skates are much less well studied than
er fishes. If there are specific studies that the referee is referring to then we would happily include
m.
commend that these issues are addressed in a revision.
or comments and suggestions:
: “factor” instead of condition
anged as suggested
: some species shrunk their range, i.e. didn’t shift towards higher latitudes, but they rather lost the
thern population
ank you for pointing out this potential source of confusion. We have now clarified by describing a
thward shift in mean latitude which accounts for both northward expansions, and southern
nctions.
eed, rising water temperatures can affect fish by limiting their ability to efficiently deliver oxygen to
ues (7, 8), and as ocean temperatures have risen, the mean latitude of some species ranges have
ted to shift towards the poles in response to changing conditions in their native habitat (9–11).”
-61: I’m confused. If you’re talking about plastic physiological responses it is not “adaptation” but
climation”, please clarify.
cclimation” is suggestive of physical mechanisms to cope with different environmental conditions
en an individual is placed in a different environment, e.g. shivering in the cold, or sweating in the

k that “physiological adaption” is more appropriate.
-65: rephrase this whole sentence, it’s awkward.

en though contemporary climate change has been accelerated through increased carbon emissions,
ural episodes of temperature change have still occurred relatively quickly across geological time

74 and on.. : if you are talking about phenotypic plasticity, then I think you need to report also
siological studies (see general comments).
hough we are talking about changing phenotypes, this is in an adaptive epigenetic sense instead of a
siological or metabolic regulatory response to changes in conditions i.e. acclimation. We have now
nged the wording throughout to try to reflect ‘adaptation’ rather than ‘acclimation’.

r authors,
ough the manuscript could have potential, in its current form it is incomprehensible to the wider
ience. Although it is possible that it can be understood by scientists who already have a fairly
ensive knowledge on (epi)genetics, this would not be the case for a majority of readers. The
oduction and Discussion sections can be fairly well understood, but there is no good connect with
(highly technical) Methods and Results sections.
ank you for pointing this out. We have attempted to add a little more explanation to the methods
results. We purposefully kept the results section short so that they can be explained in context
hin the discussion. However, the methods are in fact quite technical and to ensure repeatability of
protocol for other researchers we aimed to include all the necessary detail. We have again tried to
ude wording which explains to the non-expert reader the reasons for, and the outcomes of,
ticular approaches where possible.
as great to see the additions provided to Methods in lines 178-185, 207-213, 228-231 etc.
se additions do really help to understand the Methods. I was positively surprised to see that
viewers 1 and 2 had much less difficulty to follow the paper than I had, and combined with
revisions done by the authors this gives greater comfort that the paper is understandable to
ajority of readers. Still, some concerns remain (see below), and would require to be
ressed – as in my earlier review, below suggestions really aim at making the paper better
erstandable to the wider audience – I think it is already reasonably accessible to the more
cialist readership. This is, of course, relevant to the wide readership of a journal like Royal
iety Open Science. I think that some wording is still need to make Results better link with
cussion.
key findings cannot be grasped. The key findings seem to be mentioned in Discussion, lines 289-293
ur study suggests that a phenotypically plastic response through epigenetic regulation ... take place
r time." However, it remains unclear how the actual results section really supports this. The Methods
Results sections require significant clarification.
e believe the methods and results are now clarified and direct the reader to the discussion for
rpretation of the results.
stated above I disagree – this remains unclear (to the reader more naive on the subject)
ough the manuscript has been improved here. Perhaps, after line 344, add something like:
e base this on the very different gene expression observed between two populations which
lutionarily speaking, diverged only recently” or something simple along these lines.
have adding in the suggested clarification, however before line 344 and at the end of the
ning Discussion paragraph.
base this on the very different gene expression profiles observed between the two populations,
ch evolutionary speaking, remain very similar at the DNA nucleotide level due to only recent
aration within approximately the last 7 thousand years.”
figures are also of insufficient quality (e.g., the map in Fig. 1 should have the names of places
rred to in text included - the reader cannot be expected to look up in an atlas to check where
thumberland Strait is).
e have improved the resolution of the figures and included place names on the map. This was an
al oversight on our part.
, moreover, important to realise that, although during summer the shallow southern Gulf of St
rence is warmer than the open Bay of Fundy, the reverse is true during winter. At least this point -
ch might interfere with the hypothesis to be tested - needs to be acknowledged.
e did not include individuals from the Bay of Fundy. Our comparisons were made between those the
thumberland Strait and the Scotian Shelf. We have clarified the fact that skate in the
thumberland Strait over-winter in the much deeper Laurentian Channel to avoid the much colder
peratures of the Northumberland Strait in the winter:
figure caption 1 remains somewhat unclear. Perhaps you should write that the “sGSL
ulation of winter skate is concentrated in the relatively warm Northumberland Strait (NSL)
ing summer, when samples were collected here, and in the winter when this shallow area is
scoured, moves to the deeper Laurentian Channel where temperatures are milder then. The
tian Shelf winter skate population lives in a more oceanic area where temperatures are
der in summer, and comparable to the sGSL population during winter.”
nk you again for highlighting improvements in clarity. If fact if we were to be more accurate,
ny or even most of the sGSL winter skate occupy colder (near freezing -1.7 C) waters in
ter than those on the Scotian shelf. So they actually occupy a greater range of extreme
peratures. We have changed the figure legend to reflect this:
ure 1. Map showing variation in mean summer bottom temperatures of oceanic waters in
antic Canada (Nova Scotia – NS; Québec – QC; Newfoundland – NL). The southern Gulf of St.
rence (sGSL) population of Winter Skate (Leucoraja ocellata) is concentrated in the
thumberland Strait (NLS) during summer, when samples were collected here, and when
shallow area is ice-scoured, moves to deeper water towards the Laurentian Channel, which
experiences near freezing temperatures (-1.7°) (26). The Scotian Shelf population lives in a
re oceanic area where winter temperatures are milder and summer temperatures cooler.
summer bottom temperatures vary between these regions by circa 10°C. Although some
mer shallow waters are also found in the Bay of Fundy (NS), skates tend to move in and out
hallow regions into cooler deeper regions during the summer, compared to the NLS, which
urrounded by much deeper and colder water.”
139 “Alternatively, the epigenetic induced phenotypic adaptation may be acquired at the start of
h generation that is born in the warmer sGSL, after adults have over-wintered in the much deeper
rentian channel which has similar winter bottom temperatures to the Scotian Shelf.”
ough the hypothesis on epigenetics is interesting and potentially widely relevant, the paper, as is,
s not allow the typical reader of Royal Society Open Science to understand whether the results
sented actually do, or do not, support it. Significantly improved presentation is needed, where the
hors should focus to make this article more reader-friendly.
e believe that the discussion section puts the differences in gene expression (epigenetics) in to
text with the differences seen between populations in eco-physiology. We now recognize that
her work with more biological replicates and focus on the system is required to fully understand the
enetics of skate adaptation.

258 the reference to table S1 seems incorrect (I could not find this table in suppl. mat.). Likewise,

252, this did not seem supported by figure S2a-b. There was no caption for figure S2a-b (or c or d).

e found it better to describe the results alongside their interpretation within the discussion. This
