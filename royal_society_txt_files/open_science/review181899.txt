Overall paper presents mayrid experimental results with detailed and strong analysis. Please
clarify a few minor points as listed below
1. In “experimental procedures”, what is the film removing solution? What is it for?
2. Define corrosion rate. In line 21-23, 5 MPa was picked as the threshold pressure distinguishing
between low and high corrosion rate. But comparing the corrosion rate at 5 MPa and 8 Mpa, there
is not much difference according to figure 2
3. For Figure 4 energy spectra, provide some detailed on the spectra, especially the difference
between a), b), and c). What are they referring to?
4. For table2-6, the definitions for severe vs minor vs strong corrosion are not clear
5. In the corrosion model, please explain a little more how the corrosion constants were deducted.
For example, for nickel-plated, what is the Y-axis and units for figure 8-9
6. In line 22, it states “Table 7 and Figure 10 indicate that the values predicted by the model are
generally larger than the actual values detected.”. According to figure 10, the prediction values
for N80 are smaller than actual values

Appendix A
Manuscript Number: RSOS-181899 entitled: Mechanism and Modelling of
CO2 Corrosion on Downhole Tools, describes the corrosion failure in metal
equipment and downhole tools used in oil and gas exploration owng to presence
of corrosive environment of CO2.
The study analyzed the composition, lattice, and crystalline forms of corrosion
products in order to investigate the corrosion mechanisms. A CO2 corrosion
model was established.
It is a nice work and valuable for application in oil and gas industries. The paper
is recommended for acceptance. The minor corrections are detailed below:
i) Table 6,7: Give unit of corrosion rate.
ii) Fig. 2: the ‘y’ axis legend mm/annum may be better as mmpy
(mm/year).
iii) Fig. 5: the ‘x’ axis legend is not clear.
iv) Fig. 5: Can corrosion rate from Tafel plots be measured and
compared with gravimetric weight-loss?
v) The authors may include the following article in the introduction:

Appendix B
Dear Editor:
Thanks a lot for your letter concerning our new version of manuscript entitled
“Mechanism and Modelling of CO2 Corrosion on Downhole Tools” to
(Manuscript ID: RSOS-181899).
Thanks a lot for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our
previous version of manuscript entitled “Mechanism and Modelling of CO2
Corrosion on Downhole Tools” to (Manuscript ID: RSOS-181899), too.
Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our
paper, as well as the important guiding significance to our researches. We have
studied comments carefully and have made correction which we hope meet with
approval.
We appreciate for Editors/Reviewers’ warm work earnestly, and hope that the
correction will meet with approval. Once again, thank you very much for your
comments and suggestions.
Yours sincerely,

The main corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s comments
are as flowing:
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
#Reviewer: 1
i) Response to comment: Table 6,7: Give unit of corrosion rate.
Response: We are very sorry for our inattention. We have made supplement
according to the Reviewer’s comments. In table 6,7: unit of corrosion rate is
‘mm/year’.
ii) Response to comment: Fig. 2: the ‘y’ axis legend mm/annum may be better as
mmpy (mm/year).
Response: Although ‘mm/annum’ has the same meaning with ‘mm/year’, we have
made correction according to the Reviewer’s comments. The ‘y’ axis legend
mm/year is showed in Fig. 2.
iii) Response to comment: Fig. 5: the ‘x’ axis legend is not clear.
Response: We are very sorry for this. We have made ‘x’ axis legend clear according
to the Reviewer’s comments.
iv) Response to comment: Fig. 5: Can corrosion rate from Tafel plots be measured
and compared with gravimetric weight-loss?
Response: Theoretically, according to the parameters of the Tafel plots, the
corrosion rate can be seen, and the corrosion gravimetry can be obtained by
multiplying the corrosion rate by the corrosion time. However, the corrosion of
the four materials was mainly analyzed by the characterization of the Tafel plots.
By comparing the degree of corrosion with the current density, it is finally verified
that the nickel-plated material has the least corrosion degree.
#Reviewer: 2
1. Response to comment: In “experimental procedures”, what is the film removing
solution? What is it for?
Response: The main components of film removing solution:
Hexamethylenetetramine 1g, Potassiu-mthiocyanate 1g, Nitric acid 52.5mL,
Aniline 1mL, and Distilled water 444.5mL. The main function of the film
removing solution is to clean. We have made supplement according to the
Reviewer’s comments.
2. Response to comment: Define corrosion rate. In line 21-23, 5 MPa was picked
as the threshold pressure distinguishing between low and high corrosion rate. But
comparing the corrosion rate at 5 MPa and 8 Mpa, there is not much difference
according to figure 2.
Response: First, it can be seen from the four graphs shown in figure2 that the
corrosion rate keeps increasing from 5Mpa to 8Mpa, and the rate change of
corrosion rate at 2a (20°C) and 2b (50°C) is also increasing. The results show that
there is a qualitative change in the kinetics of CO2 corrosion around 60 °C. The
solubility of ferrous carbonate (FeCO3) has a negative temperature coefficient,
which decreases with increasing temperature. Therefore, between 60-110 °C, a
corrosion-protective film layer can be formed on the steel surface, thus causing a
transition in corrosion rate. Zone, so the rate change of 2c (80 ° C) and 2d (110 °
C) corrosion rate will not change significantly.
3. Response to comment: For Figure 4 energy spectra, provide some detailed on
the spectra, especially the difference between a), b), and c). What are they referring
to?
Response: Figure 4 energy spectra a)<U+3001>b) <U+3001>c)is the elemental analysis of three
products with different corrosion degrees respectively, and the product analysis is
carried out by analyzing the elements. We have made supplement according to the
Reviewer’s comments.
4. Response to comment: For table2-6, the definitions for severe vs minor vs
strong corrosion are not clear?
Response: NACE rp0775-2005 (preparation and installation of corrosion hooks in
oil field production and analysis of test data) specifies the degree of CO2 corrosion
in detail, and the specific content is shown below:
Table 1 regulations on the degree of CO2 corrosion in the NACE
Classify Uniform corrosion rate pitting corrosion rate
(mm/a) (mm/a)
Tiny corrosion <0.025 <0.127
Minor corrosion 0.025-0.125 0.127-0.201
Severe corrosion 0.126-0.254 0.202-0.381
Strong corrosion >0.254 >0.381
We have made supplement(Appendix <U+2160> : regulations on the degree of CO2
corrosion) according to the Reviewer’s comments.
5. Response to comment: In the corrosion model, please explain a little more how
the corrosion constants were deducted. For example, for nickel-plated, what is the
Y-axis and units for figure 8-9?
Response: The corrosion constants were not deducted. It is only through fitting the
experimental data to choose the best constant. The value of a for N80 shows a
linear trend, so the fitted value was calculated by aN80=(a1+a2)/2. The value of a
for the nickel-plated material fluctuates around the average, so this value, a =
0.589, was applied to the model. The Y-axis for figure 8-9 is a constant, and units
are ×10-1. We are very sorry for our incorrect writing. We have made correction
according to the Reviewer’s comments. The units of figure 8-9 is supplemented in
the paper.
6. Response to comment: In line 22, it states “Table 7 and Figure 10 indicate that
the values predicted by the model are generally larger than the actual values
detected.”. According to figure 10, the prediction values for N80 are smaller than
actual values?
Response: Thank you for correcting my inaccuracy. The prediction results suggest
a corrosion rate slightly higher than the actual corrosion rate for nickel-plated
material. For the highly corrosive N80 material, the predicted value is relatively
small. Compared with the nickel-plated material, the single factor of the
experimental condition is more prominent than the actual condition, so the
predicted value is relatively small. We are very sorry for our incorrect writing. We
have made correction according to the Reviewer’s comments. This has been
modified in the conclusion of the original article.
