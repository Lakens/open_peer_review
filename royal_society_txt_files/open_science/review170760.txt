Correctly identifying the threatening processes or factors responsible for sustained declines in a
species population is critical to formulating recovery plans and conservation efforts. The eastern
population of the monarch butterfly in North America has shown a marked decline in the last 25
odd years. For what appears to be a well-studied species it is surprising that no comprehensive
analysis of what has been casual in this decline has been published to date. There are papers that
have in part addressed possible factors, e.g. climate, decline in milkweed abundance. Indeed the
question has been somewhat controversial as some authors claim the decline has nothing to do
with the decline in milkweed. The author list on this manuscript is a who’s who of both monarch
population biologist/ecologists and practicing/ numerate ecologists. The contribution is I
believe timely and needed.
The authors analyse the data available on the eastern monarch population in North America and
various measures of putative threats (climatic conditions, decline in milkweed abundance,
glyphosate use, insecticide use, forest loss in Mexico, infection levels).
In some ways the authors are a little close to the subject and gloss over areas that may not be
familiar to a wider audience. I think they need to outline the system in the introduction more
fully before going onto threats. In places the text is muddled.
It is not clear why they stop at the 2014-15 season? Having pointed out the series is relatively
short for a statistical analysis they are effectively ignoring an additional 2 years of data? Is an
update possible?
Some references seem to missing from the reading list and I have taken the liberty to point these
out. They seem relevant. The actual data used is not always clear. So OE infection comes from a
paper published in 1999 so I cannot see how they series is “made up” to 2014.
I believe the paper should be accepted subject to revision. I have annotated the manuscript
extensively with comments and areas that I believe need to be strengthened. I hope these will
help improve the manuscript (Appendix A).

In the current study, the authors investigate the environmental factors underpinning population
decline in the Monarch butterfly, using a multivariate framework on 76 potential predictor
variables. Very few studies have explored of such a wide range of threats, and compared habitat
and climate variables. A ‘best subset’ of predictors was found using a ‘y-aware’ partial least
squares analysis, which accounted for the large number of variables and their multicollinearity,
as well as exploring their relationship with the response variable; population size estimates based
on overwintering habitat occupied in hectares. This best subset was then explored further using
time-series analysis to give the best explanatory model, which included negative effects from 3
environmental predictors from the Northern US (breeding habitat), namely cumulative
glyphosate application (a proxy for habitat loss, supported by an additional structural equation
model) and two climatic variables (minimum temperatures in August and from 1-10th of May,
respectively).
Generally, I find the results of the current study to be interesting and novel, and the statistical
framework used to be rigorous and logical. I also enjoyed that the authors explored such a wide
range of environmental drivers of population decline, something that is imperative from future
studies in conservation biology and ecology. I do however, think that in its current form, the
manuscript lacks clarity in several parts of the methodology, and the following points need to be
addressed before publication:
1) Estimates of the population size of Monarch butterflies
The response variable for the study was based on the area of overwintering habitat occupied by
monarch butterflies in Mexico. However, in the current study it is unclear exactly how much of
the monarch overwintering habitat is in the cites sampled. The authors state (pg 5, line 55-56) that
“the vast majority of eastern migratory monarchs alive at the end of the year are in these
colonies”, but is this the whole population? Is it at all possible that there are other overwintering
colonies that are not accounted for, increasing uncertainty? This needs clarification, preferably of
how much of the total population these overwintering sites account for.
2) Missing data
The authors set out that they used a Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Function to
interpolate missing data. However, it is not clear how much of the data is affected by this
quantitatively (The authors do state variables with missing data qualitatively in Table 1), and
therefore how much uncertainty there is in all subsequent analysis. Quantification of the
proportion of data (of the variables that are affected) is needed to clarify this issue, potentially as
an extra column in Table 1?
3) Time-series analysis
3a) Although the authors imply that there was a model selection process used in the time-series
analysis (selection based on BIC), the framework that was used to perform the selection is not
clear at all. Were all potential variable combinations explored? Table 2 highlights the coefficients
and model statistics from a subset of nine models, but we do not know how many were explored
to start with. There are nine variables in Table 2 (although also not clear whether this was all of
the variables used, see point 3b), which means there are 255 potential variable combinations with
4 or fewer predictors. Preferably, all of these models were explored, and if so this needs to be
4
stated, and if not, then a detailed account of how and why a smaller subset of models was
explored needs to be included in the manuscript.
3b) The authors state that they reduced the initial variable list to include only the 10 highest
loading variables in each component, which were then reduced further before the time-series
analysis. However It is not clear on how many variables the final time-series analysis was carried
out on (both in methods and results). Table 2 shows 9 predictors, but was this the number that
was explored? This must be clarified in the manuscript.
3c) The authors state that the time-series regression was carried out using an autoregressive
model, implying that overwintering area (ha) in the previous year was included as a covariate.
However, Table 2 suggests that models without an autoregressive component were explored (i.e.
without overwintering area in the previous year). This needs to be clarified and the models used
clearly stated.
Minor comments:
1) Title: Should be either ‘Threats associated with the decline of the Monarch Butterfly’ or
‘Threats associated with the decline of Monarch Butterflies’
2) Page 6 Line 24: “We examined more than two dozen principal factors”. This seems
contradictory to what is stated elsewhere in the manuscript. Figures and suggest 43 variables but
the conclusion clearly says 76. This needs to be consistent across the manuscript and it was
confusing to read.
3) Page 7 Line 34: The authors assumed that there was no loss to forest before 2001. This is a big
assumption to make, and so needs to be justified in the text more rather than just referencing
Vidal et al.
4) Page 10 Line 57: Which version of R was used? If the same for all analyses, then maybe just
state this at the start of the statistical analysis section.
5) Page 12 Line 38: It isn’t clear to me what is meant by slowly evolving covariates. This is used at
several points during the manuscript. I would prefer an explanation of this.
6) Page 15 Line 59 and Page 16 Line 1: The authors state that glyphosate application obviated the
need for the previous years abundance. This also suggests that not only autoregressive models
were used in the analysis (refer to major comment 3c).
As well as these minor points, I think that manuscript would benefit from further proofreading.
In particular I would address the use of brackets, which were often left un-closed.

Both of the reviewers found a lot of merit with the paper and the analyses. Both suggest that the
paper be accepted subject to minor revisions, and I agree with them. Each highlights slightly
different areas where the clarity and amount of detail could be improved. I agree that as the
paper offers an insightful approach to investigating decline, ensuring that the methods and clear
and reproducible will maximise the impact of the paper.

3

5
Despite rising concern over the monarch butterfly’s status, no comprehensive study of the factors
6
7 driving this population decline has been conducted. Using partial least squares regressions and time-
8
9 series analysis, we investigated climatic and habitat-related factors influencing monarch population
10
11 size from 1993–2014. Potential threats included measures of climatic factors, habitat loss (milkweed
12
13
and overwinter forest), disease, and agricultural insecticide use (neonicotinoids). While climatic
14
15
16 factors, principally breeding season temperature, were important determinants of annual variation in

18 abundance, our results indicated strong negative relationships between population size and habitat
19
20 loss variables, principally glyphosate use, but also weaker negative effects from the loss of
21
22 overwinter forest and breeding season use of neonicotinoids. Further declines in population size
23
24
25
because of glyphosate application are not expected. Thus, if remaining threats to habitat are mitigated
26
27 then we should expect climate-induced stochastic variation of the eastern migratory population of
28
29 monarch butterfly around a relatively stationary population size.

37
38
The eastern migratory population size of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) has been highly
39
40
41 variable over the last two decades but shows long-term declines based on annual monitoring of their
42
43 overwintering colonies in central Mexico; the population declined 84% between the winters of 1996–
44
45 1997 and 2014–2015 and faces a risk of quasi-extinction of 11–57% in the next 20 years 1. In
46
47 response to declines in monarchs and other pollinators, on June 2014, the administration of President
48
49
50
Obama issued a presidential memorandum calling for the restoration of pollinator and monarch
51
52 habitat 2. In August 2014, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) was petitioned to list the
53
54 monarch as a threatened species 3. The decline in monarch numbers is particularly concerning

because the species has a remarkably high societal and cultural value 4, and many educational 5,
1
2 citizen science 6, and conservation 7 programs engage people with monarchs. To effectively conserve
3
4 this imperiled species, understanding the threats affecting annual abundance is important. Here, we
5
6 perform a partial least squares regression and time-series analysis to investigate potential factors
7
8
9 influencing monarch overwintering population dynamics from 1993 to 2014.
10
11 Monarchs face a variety of threats which could affect their migration. A leading hypothesis
12
13 for the decline of the eastern monarch population is habitat loss across its range 8–13. Habitat loss in
14
15 the overwintering sites in Mexico is primarily caused by climatic trends and illegal logging, although
16
17
rates of logging have slowed dramatically in recent years 9, 11. Milkweed (genus Asclepias) is the
18
19
20 obligate host plant and food source for monarch larvae; therefore, loss of milkweed and nectar
21
22 resources in the breeding grounds of the Upper Midwestern U.S. is another risk 10. For example,
23
24 milkweed abundance in Iowa declined 58% from 1999 to 2010, due primarily to herbicide usage
25
26 associated with increased planting of genetically modified glyphosate-tolerant corn and soybeans 10.
27
28
29 Agricultural conversion of habitat associated with Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands also
30
31 poses an ongoing threat 14. Due primarily to the loss of milkweed, Pleasants and Oberhauser (2013)
32
33 estimated that monarch reproduction in the Midwest was reduced by 81% over this time period.
34
35 Monarch population dynamics are also influenced by climatic factors, including temperature
36
37
and precipitation during the overwintering, migration, and breeding seasons 15–20. Increasing climate
38
39
40 variability, extreme weather events, and climate change may pose a threat for monarchs 15–20. For
41
42 example, predictions of northern range shifts of monarchs and their ecological niche during the
43
44 breeding season could lead to longer migration times and potentially reduced survival, or
45
46 alternatively, reduced range size if monarchs are unable to track changing conditions 16,17. Winter
47
48
49 storms have caused high levels of mortality in overwintering colonies 21, and climate change may
50
51 result in extensive portions of overwintering habitat becoming unsuitable for monarchs 15 and oyamel
52
53 fir (Abies religiosa) trees (which harbor wintering monarchs) 22 within the next 40 years.
54
55 In addition to habitat loss and climate and weather factors, monarchs also face a variety of
56
57
other well-documented threats. For example, the protozoan parasite Ophryocystis elektroscirrha (OE)
58
59
60 can have high rates of infection in monarch populations and can reduce survival, mass, flight speed,

flight endurance, and lifespan 8, 23, 24. Insecticide use is also of concern for monarch populations;
1
2
recently, the use of neonicotinoid insecticides has been implicated in delayed development times and
3
4
5 smaller body sizes in monarchs, and elevated mortality rates, reduced population persistence,
6
7 behavioral changes, and slower development times in other pollinators 25–27. Additionally,
8
9 insecticides commonly used for mosquito control kill monarch larvae and adults 28, 29.
10
11 Existing models of monarch population dynamics have not comprehensively examined the
12
13
14 role of multiple factors driving the observed population decline. Previous investigations of monarch
15
16 population declines and threats to monarchs have focused on documenting population trends and
17
18 extinction risk 1, 10, 30, assessing potential impacts of climate on breeding 16, 17, 20, threats to the
19
20 overwintering habitat 15 ,31–33, the relationship between monarch population size and breeding habitat
21
22
23
loss 8,34, the effects of the loss of agricultural milkweed on monarch fecundity 35, and understanding
24
25 demographic relationships across generations within the migratory cycle 30, 36. Furthermore, a few
26
27 continent-wide models exist, including future projections of the impacts of climate change,
28
29 overwintering habitat loss, and milkweed loss on monarch populations to 2100 11, 37.
30
31 We used partial least square regression models and time-series analysis to examine the
32
33
34 influence of multiple factors on monarch butterfly overwintering population size from 1993 to 2014
35
36 (Table 1). Our list of potential factors was informed by published literature 8, 11, 12, 15–26, 29, 33
and
37
38 expert opinion. We examined potential threats to the monarch population for which large-scale,
39
40 range-wide data existed; this precluded investigating some potential threats that had inadequate time
41
42
43
series data such as nectar availability in breeding and migration.
44
45
46 3. Materials and Methods
47
48 We examined the role of multiple factors on monarch butterfly overwintering population sizes
49
50
51
observed annually in Mexico from 1993 to 2014 38. Population size data were based on the amount
52
53 (ha) of overwintering habitat occupied by eastern migratory monarchs when they congregate in the
54
55 high-elevation oyamel fir forests of central Mexico. Since the vast majority of the eastern migratory
56
57 population of monarchs alive at the end of each year are in these colonies, the area that they occupy
58
59
is a proxy for the total population size (assuming relatively constant density in their overwintering

sites 39. We used estimates of monarch butterfly overwintering population size from a population
1
2 viability analysis 1, a Bayesian state-space model analysis that produced estimates of the population
3
4 size from 1993–2014 while mathematically controlling for observation error. We assumed this time
5
6 series of overwinter abundance was generated by a general process:

10
11 where x is the population state, f(x,<U+03B8>) describes deterministic aspects of the time series, and g(x,<U+03B8>)dW
12
13 determines stochastics aspects of the system.
14
15 We included a list of potential threats and climatic factors informing these deterministic and
16
17
18
stochastic components from a review of the published literature and expert opinion elicited at the
19
20 “Continental scale monarch conservation planning” working group meeting at the U.S. Geological
21
22 Survey’s John Wesley Powell Center for Analysis and Synthesis and further refined by participants
23
24 of the U.S. Monarch Conservation Science Partnership. We examined more than two dozen principal
25
26 factors considered important in monarch population dynamics for which large-scale, range-wide data
27
28
29 existed (Table 1).
30
31 We segregated the monarch life cycle into regions based on Oberhauser et al. (2017) (Figure
32
33 1). Our model examined factors across the breeding region that included the Southern U.S., and the
34
35 North Central and North East breeding areas; for non-climatic factors, the North Central and North
36
37
38
East were summed into a Northern breeding region. Unfortunately, many of the data sources we
39
40 gathered do not have ready-made counterparts for southern Canada; we assumed data from these
41
42 regions correlated with those of their geographic counterpart in the U.S. This assumption seems
43
44 reasonable given that the vast majority of northern-breeding butterflies breed in the American
45
46
portion. We also examined climate and habitat loss occurring in the Mexican overwintering area.
47
48
49
50
51 Habitat availability. We estimated habitat loss factors by breeding region including the Southern
52
53 U.S. and the North – which included both the North Central and the North East breeding areas
54
55 (Figure 1). We summed the North Central and North East as they encompass similar stages
56
57
58
(generation numbers 2, 3 and 4) in the monarch’s annual lifecycle. Habitat loss included several
59
60 proxies of milkweed and nectar resource losses, including herbicide use (Dicamba, 2,4-D, and
R. Soc. open sci. https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos

glyphosate, which reduce milkweed densities in agricultural fields 10, 13), and extent of beneficial
1
2
habitat, Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land 40, which has declined in the last decade 13, 41. Our
3
4
5 model included both annual glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) use from 1993 to 2014, and
6
7 cumulative glyphosate use per region over time. Because agricultural fields were important sources
8
9 of milkweed and monarchs in 2000 before widespread adoption of glyphosate-tolerant crops 42, this
10
11 value is a proxy for monarch habitat lost 41. Total kilograms from 1993 to 2014 of two other
12
13
14 commonly used herbicides were also included (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid [hereafter 2,4-D] and
15
16 3,6-dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid [hereafter dicamba]), obtained from the U.S. Geological
17
18 Survey’s Pesticide National Synthesis Project 43. 2,4-D is one of the oldest, most widely used
19
20 herbicides in the world, used commonly on lawns, cereal crops, pastures, and orchards. Dicamba, on
21
22
23
the other hand, is often used in pastures, fence rows, and roadsides to control brush, bracken, and
24
25 broadleaf weeds. Lastly, we used the total number of hectares of CRP land from 1993 to 2014 40.
26
27 We examined annual forest loss in the overwintering area 11, 44 made available through use of
28
29 high-resolution aerial photography, multi-resolution satellite imagery, and field surveys. Both studies
30
31 reported loss over several-year periods, which we annualized to create an annual time series. For the
32
33
34 sake of our analyses, we assumed for the Vidal et al.11 time series that there was no forest loss prior
35
36 to 2001; because one study ended in 2012 44 and the other in 2013 11, we used interpolative methods
37
38 to predict the missing years to 2014 (see Missing Data). These studies are similar in that they
39
40 demonstrate cumulative forest loss, but they differ in the reported total amount of forest loss;
41
42
43
therefore, their separate use is a matter of parametric uncertainty.
44
45
46
47 Reproduction. We obtained monthly total precipitation and temperature maxima and minima data
48
49 for the conterminous United States for each month between 1993 and 2014 from the PRISM dataset

51 (4-km resolution, PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State

56 Central, and North East U.S. breeding areas (Figure 1) that are our expert team hypothesized were
57
58 important for monarch migration and fecundity, or that had been identified in previous studies 18-20.
59
60 Total precipitation and mean temperatures in the South from 1 March to 30 April were included from

3
4 positively or negatively from the mean 46 was used in the South (for the period 1 March to 31 May)
5
6 and in the North Central and North East (1 June to 30 August) to coincide with the presence of
7
8
9 monarchs in these regions. For the North Central and North East, we also included mean
10
11 temperatures and total number of days >21.1° C (>70° F) for each 10-day period between 1 May to
12
13 10 June from 1993 to 2014, mean temperatures in June from 1993 to 2014, and monthly extreme cold
14
15 events in June through August (measured as percentage of days below the 10 percentile for minimum
16
17
temperatures) from 1993 to 2012. In addition, we included mean night time temperatures 46 from 1
18
19
20 September to 30 November for the South in fall, from 1993 to 2014. Each of these factors are
21
22 expected to influence reproduction through reduction in host plant quality, delayed growth of larvae,
23
24 and potential mis-matching of host plant availability and monarch presence.
25
26 We included growing degree days (GDD) for monarchs from 1993 to 2014, which
27
28
29 accumulate the degrees that can contribute to development within a suitable temperature range
30
31 (11.5°C to 36°C) 47, 48. An average of 352 GDD is needed for an egg to develop into an adult
32
33 monarch 35, 47; daily GDD are calculated using the mean of the day’s highest (<36°C) and lowest
34
35 temperatures. The minimum temperature required for growth (11.5°C) was subtracted from the mean
36
37
value to estimate the daily GDD value. We calculated GDD in the South from 22 March to 13 June
38
39
40 for spring, and from 6 September to 21 November for fall. For the North Central and North East
41
42 region, we calculated GDD from 3 May to 12 September. Regional GDD estimates are based on
43
44 mean accumulated GDD from a number of locations within each region (51 sites in the South, 54
45
46 sites in the North Central, and 35 sites in the North East).
47
48
49
50
51 Survival. We included the proportion of the eastern population of monarch butterfly infected with
52
53 the protozoan parasite Ophryocystis elektroscirrha (OE) from 1993 to 2012 in the overwintering and
54
55 the fall migratory population. Infection by OE leads to reduced survival 23; as such, infected
56
57
monarchs are less likely to complete migration 8, 25. We imputed the two years of missing values.

We also used total kilograms per hectare of several kinds of neonicotinoid insecticides used in
1
2
the Southern U.S., and the North Central and the North East breeding areas 49. For neonicotinoids,
3
4
5 clothianidin was measured from 2004 to 2008, dinotefuran was measured from 2005 to 2009,
6
7 imidacloprid was measured from 1994 to 2009, and thiamethoxam was measured from 2000 to 2009;
8
9 these four chemicals were the most commonly used neonicotinoids during the period of study. Before
10
11 the years 2004, 2005, 1994, and 2000, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam,
12
13
14 respectively, were not widely used. We also measured total neonicotinoid use per region by summing
15
16 the 4 different varieties. We recognize the potential for delays in the effect of agricultural chemicals
17
18 and their ability to persist in the environment 25, 50–52 but we dispensed with lagged effects for the
19
20 sake of parsimony. Because most mosquito control efforts occur in places with high human densities
21
22
23
and most models suggest that rural areas are more important to monarch production 28, we did not
24
25 consider insecticides mainly used to control mosquitoes and instead focused on those used to control
26
27 agricultural pests.
28
29 Similar to growing degree days, lethal degree days (LDD), which count the degrees that are
30
31 lethal or have sublethal fitness effects for monarchs (=38°C 53), were assessed from 1993 to 2014 for
32
33
34 the breeding regions. The highest daily temperature was recorded for days reaching the threshold of
35
36 38°C and then 37°C was subtracted.
37
38 We examined weather-related effects during the overwintering period with mean, mean
39
40 minimum, and mean maximum temperature (°C), humidity (%), and wind speed, maximum wind
41
42
43
gust (m s-1), and total precipitation (mm) for each year for 13-31 December, when monarch
44
45 population size is assessed by World Wildlife Fund-Mexico and their partners. Because there are
46
47 considerable gaps (particularly in the mid-1990s) in the temperature and precipitation data for the
48
49 weather station nearest to the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (Toluca, Mexico), data were
50
51 obtained from a numerical meso-scale model 54.

6 Variable Reduction. Because there are many different factors potentially affecting long-term and
7
8
9 annual changes in monarch butterfly population size, and relatively few years of measured
10
11 overwintering population data, application of linear regression is problematic due to non-
12
13 independence of environmental covariates, lack of statistical power, and the associated inability to
14
15 differentiate effects of covariates without risk of overfitting models 58. To tackle this problem, we
16
17
employed a data reduction technique, partial least squares regression 58-60 on our full dataset of
18
19
20 variables (Table 1), to reduce the dimensionality of the covariate information and address the concern
21
22 for multicollinearity. Unlike principal components analysis and other similar dimension reduction
23
24 procedures, this approach is ‘y-aware’, extracting latent components from the predictor variables that
25
26 maximize covariance with the response (monarch population size) 58. Partial least squares analyses
27
28
29 have three simultaneous objectives: the best explanation of the X-space (the set of environmental
30
31 predictors), the best explanation of the Y-space (the biological response), and, importantly, the
32
33 greatest relationship between the X- and Y-space. We used this y-aware dimension reduction to
34
35 identify a subset of variables for use in subsequent time series analyses of annual population size.
36
37
This shortened list consisted of the variables with the greatest absolute loading (i.e., the largest
38
39
40 correlation) on each component from the partial least squares regression results (loadings = 0.15).
41
42 To determine model performance of these partial least squares regressions, we calculated the
43
44 fitted R2. Additionally, we conducted a complete leave-one-out cross-validation and, for each model,
45
46 calculated the predicted residual error sum of squares (PRESS) and Q2, also known as the cross-
47
48
49 validated R2 61. The PRESS statistic is calculated as  = <U+2211> - /  , where the notation

Time-series Analysis. We selected the most highly loaded variables (loadings >|0.15|) from the
3
4
5 partial least square regression components (i.e., 10 variables from each component). We selected the
6
7 overwinter forest loss variable with the higher loading. When variables for multiple regions
8
9 expressed high loadings, we selected the variable for the North Central region because of its
10
11 importance to breeding 12, 34. Using this reduced set of variables, we then calculated time series
12
13
14 regressions 63, 64. Annual overwinter population size was estimated with an autoregressive model 1
15
16 implying a density-dependent relationship 66 between abundances in year t and t+1. Thus, we
17
18 modelled the time series of estimated population size as a Gompertz model for log index with
19
20 environmental factors as covariates 65, 67, with the general form:
21
22
23
24
25 -. = /0 + 1 2.  + 4. (1)
26
27
28
29 where -. is the natural log of population size in year t; /0 is a constant representing the intrinsic rate
30
31
of population growth; X is the design matrix including explanatory variables relating to abundance in
32
33
34 the previous year (Nt-1), habitat loss, parasite infection, insecticide exposure, and climate and weather
35
36 factors on population size in year t; ß quantifies the effects of these variables on Nt; and 4. is the
37
38 random error component representing unknown environmental variation and is i.i.d. normally
39
40
distributed (white noise) with zero mean and variance s2.
41
42
43 All time-series models were limited to =4 predictor variables due to the limited sample size of
44
45 the response variable. Models were ranked according to their Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC),
46
47 variable importance was calculated based upon the sum of the model weights, and inferences were
48
49 made from the best-supported models (=10 BIC units of the highest-ranking model). Model-averaged
50
51
52
parameter estimates were calculated from the best-subset of covariates with estimates shrunk toward
53
54 0 in accordance with variable importance 68. Models were assessed for residual temporal structure by
55
56 plotting the autocorrelation function and compared with BIC to general least squares regression
57
58 alternatives.

Lastly, the best-subset regressions suggested that glyphosate application was the most
1
2 commonly associated covariate with overwinter population size. A number of recent studies 10, 13, 18,
3
4 34, 69
link the loss of milkweeds, the sole host plant of monarch butterflies, in Midwest corn and
5
6 soybean fields to the use of glyphosate. We used estimates of milkweed resource in the northcentral
7
8
9 U.S. provided by Pleasants 41 in a structural equation model examining a cause-effect relationship
10
11 among these variables, written as:
12
13 log(Overwinter population size) = d·log(Milkweed Resource)
14
15 log(Milkweed Resource) = <U+03B3>·log(Cumulative Glyphosate Application).
16
17
This structural equation model was calculated with the lavaan package 70 in R; model fit was
18
19
20 assessed with the root mean square error of approximation index (RMSEAI), and the comparative fit
21
22 index (CFI). Our model code is attached as Appendix B.

ability. The first component explained nearly 6 times the variation in overwinter population size
34
35
36 compared to the second component (77.8% versus 13.3%). This first component loaded heavily on
37
38 slowly evolving covariates such as herbicide and insecticide application rates, inertia of population
39
40 size in the previous year, and infection by OE (Figure 2). The second component loaded on
41
42 stochastically varying variables related to climate, principally measures of temperature during June.
43
44
45 The direction and strength of the variable loadings indicated population size in the previous
46
47 year was a positively associated determinant of population size, as was total extent of Conservation
48
49 Reserve Program land in the North and South. Glyphosate use and neonicotinoid application in all
50
51 regions, and parasitism by OE were negatively associated with population size. Glyphosate use,
52
53
followed by the amount of forest loss in the overwintering area and neonicotinoid use in the breeding
54
55
56 period, had the strongest negative loadings (or correlations with population size). Counterintuitively,
57
58 dicamba and 2,4-D application in the Northern regions was positively associated with population size

(both herbicides declined in use in the North at the time that monarchs were also in decline);
1
2
however, in the South, the use of these herbicides was negatively associated with population size
3
4
5 (both herbicides increased in use in the South over the period of study).
6
7 Stochastically varying climatic factors largely expressed strong loadings on the second
8
9 component (Figure 2). Phenological patterns in climate appeared to influence population size; in
10
11 general, earlier warm temperatures (mean temperatures and number of days >21.1° C from 1–20 May)
12
13
14 were negatively associated with population size, whereas later warm temperatures (31 May–9 June)
15
16 in the northern regions were positively associated. As expected, growing degree days were positively
17
18 associated with population size, as were warmer temperatures in the month of June in the North
19
20 Central and North East region. Curiously, population size declined as the minimum temperature in
21
22
23
summer months increased in the North Central region. Drought in all regions (as characterized by the
24
25 second component) had a deleterious effect on population size.
26
27 Correlation among covariates shared across regions was generally high for the slowly
28
29 evolving covariates (e.g., cumulative glyphosate application in the North and South was correlated r
30
31 = 0.999). Thus, regression models were constructed with covariates from a single region, the North
32
33
34 Central. The best subset of reduced-variable models, comprising a cumulative sum of model weights
35
36 equal to 0.94 and none with more than 3 covariates, comprised 9 models (Table 2). Eight of 9 models
37
38 included cumulative glyphosate application; the top model also included the number of days in
39
40 period 1 with temperature >21.1° C (>70° F) and minimum temperature in August. These three
41
42
43
variables each had variable importance measures of >0.91; the other variables in the best subset had
44
45 variable importance measures <0.04.
46
47 The best time series regression model, explaining 93% of the variation in overwinter
48
49 population size, had a model weight of 0.919, nearly 6 times the weight of all other models
50
51 combined. Cumulative glyphosate application was strongly negatively associated with overwinter
52
53
54 population size (Figure 3a; Appendix C). Both the number of days with temperature >21.1°C (Figure
55
56 3b) and minimum temperature in August (Figure 3c) were moderately negatively associated with
57
58 overwinter population size. The best reduced-variable model explained patterns in overwinter
59
60 population size (r = 0.96) as well as the partial least squares regression (r = 0.95) (Figure 4).

5. Discussion
15 A better understanding of major drivers of monarch population dynamics can inform the multitude of
16
17 ongoing conservation efforts invested in this species. We found that the long-term drivers of
18
19 population size in the eastern migratory population of monarch butterflies are slowly evolving factors
20
21 relating to changes in habitat amount and quality. Annual stochastic changes in population size
22
23
24 principally reflect changes in climatic conditions early in the northern breeding period 71.
25
26 Strong partial least squares regression loadings on the first component implicated a number of
27
28 factors potentially responsible for the long-term decline in overwinter population size. The principle
29
30 variables were glyphosate and neonicotinoid use in the breeding period and total forest loss in the
31
32
overwintering area. Neonicotinoid exposure results in increased development times, higher mortality
33
34
35 rates, and smaller body weights for monarchs 26 and has been associated with the decline of
36
37 Lepidoptera in the U.K. and California 72, 73. Total neonicotinoid usage increased 48-fold in the
38
39 northern U.S. between 2003 and 2010 (Appendix A), but thereafter began declining, likely lessening
40
41 the correlation between neonicotinoid application and monarch butterfly abundance. Total forest loss
42
43
44 in the overwintering area was a strong correlate of species abundance, irrespective of the data source
45
46 considered 11, 22. The strongest loading, however, and the covariate identified in 8 of the 9 top
47
48 performing reduced-variable linear models suggested that glyphosate application, by removing their
49
50 obligate host plant, was the stressor most highly associated with the decline of the eastern migratory
51
52
population of monarch butterflies.
53
54
55 Similar to other studies, we found that monarch population dynamics were strongly
56
57 influenced by climatic factors 15-17, 20. Strong loadings by minimum and mean June temperature, as
58
59 well as temperature in Period 4 (31 May-9 June), on the second component of the partial least
60

Page 15 of 32 Royal Society Open Science: For review only 15
squares regression indicated that temperature variation in the early growing season had an important
1
2
influence on subsequent overwinter population size. Earlier warm temperatures (mean temperatures
3
4
5 and number of days >21.1° C from 1–20 May) in the northern regions were negatively associated
6
7 with population size, whereas later warm temperatures (31 May–9 June) were positively associated
8
9 with abundance. As minimum June temperature increased, however, population size declined. These
10
11 results cohere with 20 Zipkin et al. (2012:7), who reported that the accumulation of monarch growing
12
13
14 degree days had the strongest positive impact on counts of monarch butterflies in Ohio in the coolest
15
16 sites, but that this effect diminished as sites became warmer, with the pattern beginning to reverse at
17
18 the warmest sites. These temperature-abundance correlates suggest the possibility of a phenological
19
20 mismatch, either between monarchs and their host plants or nectar sources, and diminished access to
21
22
23
optimal resources 20 in early warm years. Minimum temperature in August was negatively related to
24
25 abundance, perhaps because heightened temperatures forestall reproductive diapause and the
26
27 subsequent onset of migration. Unlike Zipkin et al.20, we did not find strong effects of precipitation
28
29 on annual patterns in abundance, perhaps because precipitation, unlike temperature, exhibits
30
31 considerably more spatial and temporal heterogeneity, which may have been dampened at the
32
33
34 regional scales we examined.
35
36 Ecological processes are often extremely complex and, as a result, it can be difficult to
37
38 discern putative cause-and-effect relations when there are many more predictor variables than there
39
40 are samples. Small sample sizes preclude complex model development using traditional regression
41
42
43
techniques and many environmental covariates associated with biotic responses often covary. The
44
45 partial least squares regression approach we took simultaneously maximizes the explained variation
46
47 in the X-space (predictor variables), the explained variation in the Y-space (response variable), and
48
49 the conjoint variation of the X- and Y-spaces (predictor and response variables). Despite the strengths
50
51 of the partial least squares approach, there are still uncertainties remaining that we cannot overcome
52
53
54 with the data at hand. For instance, our ability to predict change in population size from one year to
55
56 the next is hampered by noisy, collinear variables. Glyphosate application (irrespective of whether
57
58 measured as cumulative or annual) obviated the need for previous year’s abundance, derogating the
59
60

role density dependence plays at the scale of our study. Additional data may increase the
1
2 differentiability of the other collinear variables in the future.
3
4 Our analysis suggests that immediate steps to mitigate the large declines in milkweed due to
5
6 the use of herbicide-tolerant crops in the breeding region is a key strategy for monarch restoration 10,
7
8 12, 74
9 . The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) offers one particularly important mechanism for
10
11 providing high-quality habitat for milkweed and the monarch butterflies reliant on them 74;
12
13 encouraging farmers and other land managers to include forbs and milkweed in seed mixes for CRP
14
15 and other farm conservation incentive programs could increase monarch habitat. Zalucki and
16
17
Lammers 35 suggested a strategy for monarch conservation in the vast agricultural areas of the Corn
18
19
20 Belt should be to increase milkweed abundance in the “matrix”, the land in between the remaining
21
22 monarch habitat patches. This strategy could include focusing on roadsides and other right-of-way
23
24 lands, yards, and fencerows 41, 74. In the southern U.S., there has not been a single factor associated
25
26 with extensive habitat loss; instead, multiple years of below-average precipitation may have had a
27
28
29 larger effect on monarchs than habitat loss in this region. Improving monarch habitat across the
30
31 species annual cycle may be more challenging, but doing so may ameliorate climate-related losses in
32
33 any single step of the annual cycle.
34
35 Given that =92% of corn and soy agriculture in the northern U.S. is now glyphosate-tolerant
36
37 75
, we might expect relatively little additional loss of agricultural fields as habitat for monarch
38
39
40 butterflies 18. Essentially, large declines in the carrying capacity of the eastern monarch population
41
42 are nearly complete and predictions from both the partial least squares regression and the best
43
44 reduced-variable linear model suggest a roughly stationary population for the years 2012–2014
45
46 (Figure 4). Thus, the ability to detect changes in monarch butterfly abundance in response to further
47
48
49 increases in glyphosate application will likely be limited 18. In the future, we may expect major
50
51 drivers of population size to be associated with changes in grassland, including CRP land, and forest
52
53 in the overwintering location. If threats to these habitats are mitigated, then we would expect climate-
54
55 induced stochastic variation of the eastern migratory population of monarch butterfly around a
56
57
relatively stationary population size (Appendix D).

3
4
5 We began our threats assessment with three times as many variables as years in our time series of
6
7
monarch butterfly population size. Partial least squares regression focused our attention on a subset
8
9
10 of the 76 variables, leading to a single-best model comprised of three covariates (i.e., glyphosate use,
11
12 number of warm days in early June, minimum August temperature) explaining >90% of the annual
13
14 variation in abundance. A structural equation model implicates the loss of milkweed as the
15
16 mechanism by which glyphosate application influences monarch butterfly population size. To offset
17
18
19 this loss of milkweed, a strategy of restoring habitat in a variety of areas including CRP lands, public
20
21 and private lands, roadsides, and marginal agricultural areas as well as protecting habitat where
22
23 monarchs overwinter would help increase monarch populations 74 and thereby reduce the probability
24
25 of extirpation. These conservation efforts should proceed quickly to avoid further monarch butterfly
26
27
28
population declines.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
Both of the reviewers found a lot of merit with the paper and the analyses. Both suggest that the paper
be accepted subject to minor revisions, and I agree with them. Each highlights slightly different areas
where the clarity and amount of detail could be improved. I agree that as the paper offers an insightful
approach to investigating decline, ensuring that the methods and clear and reproducible will maximise
the impact of the paper.
We appreciate the AE’s handling of this manuscript and the reviewer comments made
available to us. We believe the manuscript is stronger because of this review process.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_5
Correctly identifying the threatening processes or factors responsible for sustained declines in a species
population is critical to formulating recovery plans and conservation efforts. The eastern population of
the monarch butterfly in North America has shown a marked decline in the last 25 odd years. For what
appears to be a well-studied species it is surprising that no comprehensive analysis of what has been
casual in this decline has been published to date. There are papers that have in part addressed possible
factors, e.g. climate, decline in milkweed abundance. Indeed, the question has been somewhat
1
controversial as some authors claim the decline has nothing to do with the decline in milkweed. The
author list on this manuscript is a who’s who of both monarch population biologist/ecologists and
practicing/ numerate ecologists. The contribution is I believe timely and needed. The authors analyse
the data available on the eastern monarch population in North America and various measures of
putative threats (climatic conditions, decline in milkweed abundance, glyphosate use, insecticide use,
forest loss in Mexico, infection levels).
In some ways the authors are a little close to the subject and gloss over areas that may not be familiar to
a wider audience. I think they need to outline the system in the introduction more fully before going
onto threats. In places the text is muddled.
It is not clear why they stop at the 2014-15 season? Having pointed out the series is relatively short for
a statistical analysis they are effectively ignoring an additional 2 years of data? Is an update possible?
Unfortunately, data are not (yet) available for some covariates. For instance, we had to
impute missing data in a few instances (the extent of which is now depicted in Table 1);
because we rely primarily on published data, the number of instances of missing data would
increase as not all studies and data are up-to-date.
Some references seem to missing from the reading list and I have taken the liberty to point these out.
They seem relevant. The actual data used is not always clear. So OE infection comes from a paper
published in 1999 so I cannot see how they series is “made up” to 2014.
We appreciate any added literature we can cite to bolster the arguments made in this
study. The OE data were provided by co-author Sonia Altizer through the Monarch
Health project, which is now made clearer in Table 1.
I believe the paper should be accepted subject to revision. I have annotated the manuscript extensively
with comments and areas that I believe need to be strengthened. I hope these will help improve the
manuscript
The comments provided by the reviewer are much appreciated and do, in fact, improve
the manuscript. We thank the reviewer.
From comments on pdf:
Title. Awkward title as written. The following is a suggestion:
Monarch butterfly population decline in North America: identifying the threatening processes
Title changed as suggested.
Key word. With respect to ‘partial least squares’ as a key word, Is this central?
2
Partial least squares regression is an extremely useful approach to dealing with small-data
situations facing many ecologists, particularly when the covariates hypothesized exceed
the ability to collect more data. We believe this manuscript describes a useful example
for other scientists.
Abstract. The monarch is found in many other places now. The systemic decline is in North America
This is true. We were trying to keep to the word limit required of the abstract. We have
inserted ‘in North America’ where noted by the reviewer. The reviewer recommended
removal of five words from the abstract (i.e., ‘population’, ‘measures of’, ‘then’,
‘should’), which we have accepted, keeping the abstract within the limit.
Abstract. Why not include 2015-2017 seasons? Adds a little more data?
As noted above, because we relied on previously published data, many of the data
sources have not (yet) been updated to the present year. For instance, the climate
extremes we used were from a NASA-funded effort that is not continuing at this time.
Increasing amounts of missing data would increase reliance on data imputation to fill in
the missing data, a process which warrants greater scrutiny and sophistication as the
proportion of missing data increases. We do believe, though, that as years are put behind
us, there is the opportunity to test the hypothesis we advance that the monarch population
should be relatively stationary around a modest level of abundance if further losses to
habitat are arrested.
Abstract. I am not sure a measure of climate is a threat per se?
Corrected by removing ‘measures of’.
Keywords. The keywords here differ from those given above.
Rectified with the following list of keywords: Asclepias, climate extremes, Danaus
plexippus, forest loss, glyphosate, milkweed, neonicotinoid, partial least squares
Introduction, first sentence. Insert ‘in North America’
The sentence has been re-ordered and rectified per the reviewer suggestion to read as:
The population size of migratory monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) in eastern North
America has been highly variable over the last two decades but shows long-term
declines based on annual monitoring of their overwintering colonies in central Mexico…
3
Introduction, following first sentence. Note there is a correlation in California as well?
We now include the following sentence:
A similar decline has been observed in the western migratory population of monarch
butterflies 2.
And have revised the literature cited section accordingly, including
Pelton E, Jepsen S, Schultz C, Fallon C, Black SH. 2016. State of the monarch butterfly overwintering sites in California.

First full sentence of the second page of the Introduction (page 4 of 32). The reviewer
recommends striking ‘imperiled’.
We disagree. Imperil means “put at risk of being harmed, injured, or destroyed.”
Analyses by Semmens et al. (2016: page 3), which we cite, suggests the species faces a
non-negligible risk of quasi-extinction if current trends persist. Following IUCN criteria,
this species would be classified as Endangered for all but the lowest extinction threshold
they considered (this lowest threshold is basically equivalent to eastern North America’s
population clustering in three trees during winter in Mexico).
At the conclusion of the first full sentence of the second page of the Introduction (page 4 of 32). I
would be inclined to cite Caughley here?
Caughley,G. (1994) Directions in conservation biology. Journal of Animal Ecology, 63, 215–244.
We cite Caughley where suggested by the reviewer.
Last sentence of the first paragraph of the Introduction (page 4 of 32). Replace ‘perform’ with ‘use.’
Changed as suggested.
Last sentence of the first paragraph of the Introduction (page 4 of 32). With respect to
‘population dynamics’, reviewer states: strictly the size of the overwintering population in Mexico as
a measure of all the factors that influence the eastern population. Needs a clear statement of the
system and what is being assessed.
&
First sentence of the first full paragraph (page 4 of 32). Do you really mean migration or population
size in Mexico which will be a function of migration success (in both directions), surviving the winter and
breeding in the summer range.
4
Changed these sentences to read:
Here, we use partial least squares regression and time-series analysis to investigate
potential factors influencing monarch overwintering population size from 1993 to 2014.
Monarchs face a variety of threats potentially affecting their population size in Mexico.
These threats may operate at different times of the life cycle, affecting survival in winter,
breeding and survival in summer, and the success of migration between.
(page 4 of 32) They can actually develop on other species of milkweed. Asclepias species make up the
bulk of the host plants used
Replaced ‘the obligate’ with ‘an essential’.
(page 4 of 32) Re: glyphosate-resistant versus glyphosate-tolerant.
We replaced ‘tolerant’ with ‘resistant’ in the three instances in which it occurred in this
manuscript.
(page 4 of 32) Last sentence of first full paragraph,
Changed as suggested: Due primarily to the loss of milkweed, monarch reproduction in
the Midwest was estimated to have been reduced by 81% over this time period 12.
(page 4 of 32). First two sentences of second full paragraph.
We rectified the sentence in accordance with reviewer comments, including the addition
of two citations, one new and one not cited until later in the document.
(page 4 of 32). RE: “Winter storms have caused high levels of mortality in overwintering
colonies.” I presume winter storms will be part of the analysis but it is not explicitly mentioned in the
abstract?
We examined annual winter weather conditions, but not storms per se. We tried to
assemble a storm database but there were too few obvious instances in which storms
affected monarchs over the period of our examination, and the process for determining
the occurrence of these storms was too ad hoc for it to be credible. The climate and
weather data for Mexico has serious limitations, which is why we needed to use a
modeled weather product. We do not explicitly differentiate winter from other seasons
5
with respect to climate and weather in the abstract because we found little explicit effect
relative to the other stressors.
(page 4 of 32) First sentence of third paragraph.
Removed ‘also’ as suggested.
(page 5 of 32) First full paragraph. missing one study in a book edited by Oberhauser? See comment
above.
Added citation.
(page 5 of 32) First full paragraph. The Lamers paper is backed up by a recent study from the same
group. As the paper did not appear in a Northern Hemisphere Journal perhaps the authors missed it?
Zalucki et al. 2016. Movement and egg laying in Monarchs: To move or not to move, that is the
equation. Austral Ecology 41: 154-167. doi:10.1111/aec.12285
Added citation.
(page 5 of 32). RE: Furthermore, a few continent-wide models exist, including future
projections of the impacts of climate change, overwintering habitat loss, and milkweed loss on
monarch populations to 2100 11, 37.
So what is the limitation of 11 and 37? This sentence is disconnected.
We believe the reviewer was confused by incorrect numbering of the citations in this
instance; we have fixed this error. These studies describe stressors facing monarchs at
continental scales, whereas most other literature takes a finer scale examination of their
consequences on monarch butterflies.
(page 5 of 32). Last paragraph of Introduction. RE: expert opinion.
apart from the impressive author list who were these "experts" that were consulted? They should be
acknowledged or listed. I am wary of "experts" and their opinions.
We removed ‘expert opinion’ from the description here. It was meant to connote
interpretation of the literature by the authors and the attendees of meetings convened by
the Monarch Conservation Science Partnership; as suggested, we acknowledged
additional specific individuals comprising the Partnership.
6
(page 6 of 32) Added missing end parenthesis.
Done.
(page 6 of 32) so maybe add these [experts] to the acknowledgments?
Done as suggested.
(page 6 of 32) needs a number
Added appropriate citation number.
(page 6 of 32). Last sentence. is milkweed loss a proxy for nectar resource loss?
We do not assume nor do our results rely upon a positive relationship between milkweed
loss and nectar resource loss. Wherever milkweeds and nectar resources occur and, in
turn, receive herbicide treatments, the loss of one should go hand in hand with the loss of
the other. The larger question is, how well did corn and soy fields pre-glyphosate serve as
sources of nectar? This issue does not seem to be answered in the literature.
(page 7 of 32) winter storms?
We address winter weather in the section on Survival.
(page 8 of 32) RE: suggested deletion of “(>70° F)” The rest of the world has moved on
The literature we used to inform creation of our temperature covariates often expressed
temperature in Fahrenheit. Our experts discussed the matter in Fahrenheit, as well. The
data we used were converted from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
(page 8 of 32) RE: expected to influence reproduction through reduction in host plant quality,
delayed growth of larvae, and potential mis-matching of host plant availability and monarch
presence. there are direct effects of rain days on reproduction, particularly contiguous days.
This is true, at least at a local scale. Unfortunately, when precipitation is averaged over
large regions as we have done, this particular consequence is typically not evident simply
because it does not rain everywhere across a region for days on end. Thus, the ability of a
rainy environment to negatively influence reproduction at a population level is muted
accordingly.
7
(page 8 of 32) RE: 36° C. seems a bit high particularly as it is shade temperature?
This upper value is drawn directly from the citations we reference. Nail et al. (2015) did
not show any sublethal effects until 38° C.
(page 8 of 32) First sentence of Survival. RE: We included the proportion of the eastern
population of monarch butterfly infected with the protozoan parasite Ophryocystis elektroscirrha
(OE) from 1993 to 2012 in the overwintering and the fall migratory population. How was this
estimated? Technically if the estimates are based on monarchs in Mexico then it is a mixture of the
proportion infected and surviving migration.
And
(page8 of 32) Subsequent sentence. This paper is 1999. Where did the estimates of infection come
from?
We now explicitly state that these data are from data provided by Project Monarch Health
(S. Altizer, unpublished data).
(page 8 of 32). RE: Infection by OE leads to reduced survival 23; as such, infected
monarchs are less likely to complete migration 8,25. not sure about the relevance of ref 25 and ref 8
is published in 2011 so where do 2 years of missing data come from?
24, not 25, substantiates the point that infected monarchs are less likely to complete
migration. This error was corrected. The two years of missing data are those not able to
be provided through Project Monarch Health by co-author S. Altizer.
(page 9 of 32). RE: Statements made pertaining to herbicide and pesticide amounts.
??? measured or use estimated? I presume these are estimates based on sales data or actual usage is
recorded?
We replaced ‘measured’ with ‘estimated’.
(page 9 of 32) RE: …we did not consider insecticides mainly used to control mosquitos…
so you have data on aerial spray application of other chemicals? Details please.
The US Geological Survey’s National Pesticide Synthesis Project provides the annual
county-level distribution of >400 agricultural compounds, some of which are used in
aerial spray applications. We cite the source of these data but a depiction of the results for

HOSATE&hilo=H&disp=Glyphosate
(page 9 of 32) RE: meso-scale model. Does this really capture the "storm" effect. Rainfall followed
by freezing conditions. These storms can have effects into January and February and even March before
colonies disperse.
There are two problems here. First, weather data for locations in proximity to the
Monarch Biosphere Reserve have large gaps in availability, specifically most of the
1990s. This is even more problematic for precipitation, which seems rarely to have been
collected. Our analyses, however, are reliant upon data streams that are consistent and, to
the extent possible, complete. The modeled data (from Meteoblue) we used relies on
those weather stations where data was collected as well as topographically sensitive
weather models and satellite data to depict daily temperature and precipitation. At the
resolution of our inquiry, we can assess rainfall followed by freezing conditions. These
events never occurred in the period we examined, specifically in December during the
two weeks prior to and during the collection of the areal estimate of the monarch
population.
The reason we did not include weather occurring after the World Wildlife Fund’s
December estimate of the population size was because that population has to experience
the entirety of the following annual cycle before the effects of the previous winter are
measured the following winter. We currently wrap this effect up in the density dependent
effect whereby abundance in year t is a function of abundance in year t-1. The effect of
the previous year is small, which means that despite whatever influence of weather may
occur in January to March, monarchs are subsequently able to ‘make up’ for it the
remaining 9 months of the year. If they were not able to make up for it, the density
dependent effect would be more pronounced, supporting increased emphasis on
developing relations to late-winter weather data.
As a note, the reviewer recognizes this scale-related difference between regional and
local when, on page 16, the reviewer writes: yes given the scale it would have to be
prolonged rain over a wide area. "Local" storms will be just that.
(page 10 of 32). RE: availability of data. show all. In the interests of transparency the complete data
set should be accessible? I assume it is.
The data are available to the reader via ScienceBase (
http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7P55M8G ). The code are available in Appendix B as well as
via durable url ( https://my.usgs.gov/bitbucket/projects/UMESC/ ). Both are identified in
the text.
9
(page 10 of 32). RE: loadings >0.15. seems low? Justify further.
As in principal components, loadings associated with components of partial least squares
regression are constrained to a sum of squares equal to 1. Further, loadings are
proportional to the coefficients in linear combination of the original variables comprising
the components. Thus, loadings will generally be lower when there are more variables
and, especially so, when those variables are collinear (which means the explained
variance is spread over a larger set of variables). Only when data are unstandardized are
large loadings possible, largely because some variables are measured in units of, say,
kg/ha ranging over tens of thousands of units whereas others are measured in degrees
Celsius ranging over tens of units. This difference in units alone inflates the variance and
the loadings accordingly for those variables with the greater range in units. Thus, scaling
the data is standard.
Lastly, the absolute magnitude of the loadings is generally not of interest. Instead, it is the
relative magnitude that is useful in depicting differences among covariates in the
components.
(page 11 of 32) RE: density-dependent relationship. Is it reasonable to assume such a density
dependent relationship?
We did not so much assume a density-dependent relationship as much as test for it. If one
exists, we allow it through this formulation, which is standard.
(page 11 of 32) RE: i.i.d. Jargon
We removed “i.i.d.”
(page 12 of 32) RE: Pleasants et al., In press.
We updated this citation to include the now published pagination.
(page 12 of 32) RE: 91.1% so precise. personally I would round. 91% is basically high.
(page 13 of 32) RE: model weight of 0.919
We leave this matter of significant digits to the discretion of the Editor. Review of recent
issues of Royal Society publications finds that this level of numerical precision is
commonplace in reporting statistics.
10
(page 13 of 32) RE: removal of ‘also’
We decline making this change as it may lead the reader to believe that the top model
does not include glyphosate; including ‘also’ tells the reader that the model includes
glyphosate as well as other variables.
(page 14 of 32) RE: total forest loss and species abundance.
We replaced ‘species’ with ‘monarch’ to avoid the reader, perhaps, mistaking the
sentence to mean, say, Oyamel fir abundance.
(page 14 of 32) I thought it was weaker than the other effects? I would delete "strongly"
We re-wrote this sentence to emphasize that the strong influence of climatic factors is
evident after removing the long-term decline. We wrote: After controlling for the long-
term decline in monarch butterfly abundance, we found, similar to other studies, that
annual monarch population dynamics were strongly influenced by climatic factors
(page 14 of 32) Bottom of the page. the second component effect was "small" relative to the first
An alternative means of thinking of this partial least squares regression is as a means of
partitioning total system variance. The vast majority of the variance is in the 80% decline
in abundance. Once that is controlled for by the first component, the remainder is
attributed almost wholly to the second component. The second component is not strong
relative to the first, but it does explain the vast majority of the year-to-year variability we
see in abundance.
(page 16 of 32) top of the page. so no density dependence needed?
It does not appear that there are strong endogenous sources of density dependence and
that, instead, any correlation from one year to the next can largely be explained through
selection of appropriate covariates (e.g., glyphosate).
(page 16 of 32). Zalucki and Lammers. If I recall correctly in their other paper they include adding a
road of milkweed? The group in Iowa I believe is explicitly modelling milkweed use in "real" landscapes
but may not have published yet
The Monarch Conservation Science Partnership now includes Tyler Grant and Steve
Bradbury from Iowa State. As far as we understand their work developing an agent-based
simulation model for real portions of the Iowa landscape has not been published. We are
11
working with them in developing scenarios of milkweed amendment, randomly versus
systematically allocated, to discern the best strategies for assisting monarch movement in
a relatively depauperate landscape.
(page 16 of 32). Stationary abundance. Now that is a big call. NO extinction vortex?
It appears this should be so, but we are hesitant to speak too strongly on the matter given
so few years’ worth of data. Perhaps with additional years we can be more confident in
this assertion.
(Figure 1). RE: lack of Florida as part of our area for the eastern migratory population of
monarch butterflies. I have seen monarchs in southern Florida?
Monarch butterflies are resident year-round in portions of Florida and in some parts of
the Gulf Coast as people grow increasing numbers of tropical milkweed. The interaction
between the eastern migratory population and this small resident (non-migratory)
population (<2% of the total continental population) in Florida is unknown, but some
hypothesize that some fraction of the eastern migratory population leaves reproductive
diapause and joins this non-migratory Florida population, supplementing it (see Altizer et
al. 2000. Ecol. Entomol. 25, 125–139.). Unlike the western and eastern migratory
populations, whose genetics suggest these populations are largely panmictic, there seem
to be some genetic differences between the eastern migratory population and the Florida
population (see Zhan et al. 2014 Nature 514, 317–321 [doi:10.1038/nature13812]).
Nevertheless, the ecological consequences of this Florida population are poorly
understood. Because of its small size and its non-migratory nature, we do not consider
this subpopulation in our work here.
(Figure 3). This figure is not very clear. Axis labels etc
This difficulty in reading the figure appears to be a function of the importation of the
figure into the pdf; this should be readily rectifiable when the figures are handled by the
editorial staff.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_6
In the current study, the authors investigate the environmental factors underpinning population decline
in the Monarch butterfly, using a multivariate framework on 76 potential predictor variables. Very few
studies have explored of such a wide range of threats, and compared habitat and climate variables. A
‘best subset’ of predictors was found using a ‘y-aware’ partial least squares analysis, which accounted
for the large number of variables and their multicollinearity, as well as exploring their relationship with
the response variable; population size estimates based on overwintering habitat occupied in hectares.
This best subset was then explored further using time-series analysis to give the best explanatory model,
which included negative effects from 3 environmental predictors from the Northern US (breeding
habitat), namely cumulative glyphosate application (a proxy for habitat loss, supported by an additional
structural equation model) and two climatic variables (minimum temperatures in August and from 1-
10th of May, respectively).
Generally, I find the results of the current study to be interesting and novel, and the statistical
framework used to be rigorous and logical. I also enjoyed that the authors explored such a wide range of
environmental drivers of population decline, something that is imperative from future studies in
conservation biology and ecology. I do however, think that in its current form, the manuscript lacks
clarity in several parts of the methodology, and the following points need to be addressed before
publication:
1) Estimates of the population size of Monarch butterflies
The response variable for the study was based on the area of overwintering habitat occupied by
monarch butterflies in Mexico. However, in the current study it is unclear exactly how much of the
monarch overwintering habitat is in the cites sampled. The authors state (pg 5, line 55-56) that “the vast
majority of eastern migratory monarchs alive at the end of the year are in these colonies”, but is this the
whole population? Is it at all possible that there are other overwintering colonies that are not accounted
for, increasing uncertainty? This needs clarification, preferably of how much of the total population
these overwintering sites account for.
The integrity of the overwinter colony sizes as an index of the eastern migratory monarch
butterfly population size is outside the scope of this particular manuscript. Suffice it to
say, though, that the World Wildlife Fund-Mexico has invested considerable effort
searching the high-elevation Oyamel fir forests for additional colonies over the past two
decades (see Vidal et al. 2013). By and large, monarch butterflies habitually occupy the
same general areas year after year, but new colonies, often very small ones, are
sometimes found, and when they attain a non-negligible size they are subsequently
incorporated into the areal estimate.
When monarch butterfly populations were large, these small colonies amounted to
inconsequential noise given their small size. The reviewer’s concern about how well the
13
index works as population size declines, though, is certainly warranted. It seems
reasonable to surmise that these ephemeral colonies occurring at the margins, or even
those possibly well-removed from the habitual locations, may amount to a significant
fraction of the wintering population. However, no one regularly studying the
overwintering population has expressed this concern. The thinking, instead, seems to be
that as the population declines, the remaining butterflies decline into the core colonies.
We recently authored a paper discussing some of these issues (which is cited here, too).

of monarch butterflies overwintering in central Mexico. PeerJ 5, e3221. (10.7717/peerj.3221)
2) Missing data
The authors set out that they used a Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Function to interpolate
missing data. However, it is not clear how much of the data is affected by this quantitatively (The
authors do state variables with missing data qualitatively in Table 1), and therefore how much
uncertainty there is in all subsequent analysis. Quantification of the proportion of data (of the variables
that are affected) is needed to clarify this issue, potentially as an extra column in Table 1?
Done, as suggested.
3) Time-series analysis
3a) Although the authors imply that there was a model selection process used in the time-series analysis
(selection based on BIC), the framework that was used to perform the selection is not clear at all. Were
all potential variable combinations explored? Table 2 highlights the coefficients and model statistics
from a subset of nine models, but we do not know how many were explored to start with. There are
nine variables in Table 2 (although also not clear whether this was all of the variables used, see point
3b), which means there are 255 potential variable combinations with 4 or fewer predictors. Preferably,
all of these models were explored, and if so this needs to be stated, and if not, then a detailed account
of how and why a smaller subset of models was explored needs to be included in the manuscript.
We clarified that the set of 20 variables were winnowed further to prevent duplicative
covariates from entering the models. For instance, the same variable, but expressed for
the Northeast and the North Central, may have been highly loading, but we only chose to
move forward with the one representing the North Central, as this region comprises the
principle breeding region for monarch butterflies. This process left eleven variables.
We then describe how we choose combinations of 4 covariates among 11 covariates for a
total set of models equal to 330.
3b) The authors state that they reduced the initial variable list to include only the 10 highest loading
variables in each component, which were then reduced further before the time-series analysis. However
14
It is not clear on how many variables the final time-series analysis was carried out on (both in methods
and results). Table 2 shows 9 predictors, but was this the number that was explored? This must be
clarified in the manuscript.
The reply above is pertinent here, too. We also note that 2 of the 11 variables never
showed up in the top-performing models, which is why they are not seen in Table 2. We
remark upon this in the results now (top of new page 17): None of the best subset of
models were comprised of dicamba or total neonicotinoid application.
3c) The authors state that the time-series regression was carried out using an autoregressive model,
implying that overwintering area (ha) in the previous year was included as a covariate. However, Table 2
suggests that models without an autoregressive component were explored (i.e. without overwintering
area in the previous year). This needs to be clarified and the models used clearly stated.
In the last sentence of the time-series regression analyses, we had written: Models were
assessed for residual temporal structure by plotting the autocorrelation function and
compared with BIC to general least squares regression alternatives. (emphasis added
here)
We provide this exploration in our code, included as an appendix. In no instance did the
alternative models perform as well, principally because the addition of covariates
explained the year-over-year correlation. We now include the following statement in the
Results (top of new page 17): Further, each of the models in the best subset possessed a
slowly evolving covariate explaining trend, obviating need for the previous year’s
abundance or an autoregressive correlation structure.
Minor comments:
1) Title: Should be either ‘Threats associated with the decline of the Monarch Butterfly’ or ‘Threats
associated with the decline of Monarch Butterflies’
Both reviewers took issue with our title. We revised the title according to the suggestion
of the first reviewer.
2) Page 6 Line 24: “We examined more than two dozen principal factors”. This seems contradictory to
what is stated elsewhere in the manuscript. Figures and suggest 43 variables but the conclusion clearly
says 76. This needs to be consistent across the manuscript and it was confusing to read.
There were 76 original variables, but many of these are the same variable estimated in
three different regions. We have clarified the statement on page 6, line 24 to now read,
“For each of the three regions, we examined more than two dozen principal factors.” In
the figure legend for Figure 2, we had written: “To increase ease of display, only
15
variables with loadings >|0.15| on at least one of the components are shown;” This is
the reason only 43 variables are shown.
3) Page 7 Line 34: The authors assumed that there was no loss to forest before 2001. This is a big
assumption to make, and so needs to be justified in the text more rather than just referencing Vidal et
al.
Clearly, according to Ramirez et al., overwinter forest loss is occurring before 2001.
However, these two studies define the type and magnitude of loss differently. Below is a
plot of the two sources of data. They largely differ in their intercept rather than in slope,
which explains their strong correlation (r > 0.93).
The approach we take with these covariates acts largely as pattern matching, matching
the pattern of overwinter abundance versus the pattern of overwinter cumulative forest
loss. Because of this pattern matching, the actual magnitude of the variables does not
matter. Further, given that these two sources of overwinter forest loss are strongly
correlated and using one instead of the other leads to no substantive changes in model
results, we feel confident in the prose as written.
4) Page 10 Line 57: Which version of R was used? If the same for all analyses, then maybe just state this
at the start of the statistical analysis section.
This matter was described in the original manuscript, but could have been confusing
because it was stated in association with one of the many packages we used. We have
clarified this in the revision with the last sentence of the Methods: We used R 3.3.2 for all
statistical analyses; our model code is attached as Appendix B.

5) Page 12 Line 38: It isn’t clear to me what is meant by slowly evolving covariates. This is used at several
points during the manuscript. I would prefer an explanation of this.
Slowly evolving covariates as described in Appendix A are those which have a highly
autoregressive aspect to them (see the left-most figures below), as opposed to
stochastically varying covariates which change sometimes dramatically from one year to
another (right-most figure).
We considered parenthetically adding (sometimes described as black noise) after the first
instance of the use of ‘slowly evolving’, but this sounds like jargon that distracts rather
than aids the reader.
6) Page 15 Line 59 and Page 16 Line 1: The authors state that glyphosate application obviated the need
for the previous years abundance. This also suggests that not only autoregressive models were used in
the analysis (refer to major comment 3c).
As noted above, in the last sentence of the time-series regression analyses, we had
written: Models were assessed for residual temporal structure by plotting the
autocorrelation function and compared with BIC to general least squares regression
alternatives.
We dispensed with the autoregressive models as the black noise variables (most
frequently being glyphosate) dispensed with the need for this autoregressive component.
As well as these minor points, I think that manuscript would benefit from further proofreading. In
particular I would address the use of brackets, which were often left un-closed.
Fixed.
