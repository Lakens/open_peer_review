Comments to the author
The authors used HTS on scats to determine the diet among different cohorts of Adelie penguins.
A similar study has been already conducted on Adelie penguins by Jarman et al 2013 using same
methodological approaches. The authors found, however, contrasting results with former studies
describing significant segregation among breeders and chicks during the breeding season.
Another interesting point of the paper is the comparison between the diet of breeders and non-
breeders, which have been rarely assessed in seabirds with other tools than stable isotope
analysis and data loggers.
With this said, there seem to be also some important methodological shortcomings that difficult
interpretations.
The most obvious one, is the fact that differences among cohorts are interpreted solely based on
the proportion of sequences of pre-defined prey groups found in the scats of Adelie penguins.
There are many studies including the one cited by the authors (Deagle et al. 2010) that clearly
show that the number of sequences obtained in scats might differ substantially from the actual
proportion of items given to penguins. Moreover, to interpret differences in the proportions of
sequences obtained among scats most studies have used different methodological approaches
including real time PCR to control for PCR amplification biases (resulting from higher specificity
of primers to certain prey groups) or used different molecular markers.
3
These biases might be even more aggravated when comparing chicks and adults as their scats are
probably much more degraded. (undergoing digestion processes in parents and chicks). Chicks
are also known to accumulate various prey remains in their stomach contents that are difficult to
digest, which can confound results when working with DNA analysis on scats.
Despite these biases, it is also true that the authors did not find significant differences among
cohorts, which would be probably expected given differences in digestion and DNA degradation
in scats? In any case, the authors should be giving a much higher emphasis to these
methodological constraints in the ms, while explaining why such biases unlikely influenced their
results, especially as differences are reported for breeders and non-breeders.
Another shortcoming is the actual genetic marker used and its poor taxonomic discrimination
performance. There have been other markers used in penguins diet that discriminate prey at
species and genus level. In fact, as also acknowledged by the authors, differences among adults
and chicks may occur among prey species of the same taxonomic group, and not among broad
taxonomic groups. There is also no explanations why the authors opted to do so given other
available markers. In my point of view this renders the ms very descriptive confounding further
interpretations.
Another issue in my point of view is that it is difficult to follow why the authors opted for
specific methodological approaches. For example, why did the authors opted to group sequences
into MOTUs at 90% of similarity threshold? There is very little explanation on the actual
discrimination performance of the primers used. There is even no mention on the exact region of
the non-coding SSU region amplified in prey. I understand that the primers and methodologies
used follow those of Jarman et al 2013, still there needs to be a mention on why those are
indicated for this study.
Minor comments
Introduction
Line 61-62: “Molecular analysis of faecal DNA can identify prey sequences in scats, which reflects
the relative proportions of prey ingested
Feeding trials showed that the most abundant taxa fed to penguins were the most represented
sequences in penguins scats. However, sequences of three other fish fed in constant mass
proportions were all detected, but proportions of sequences were considerably different than
mass proportions in the diet (Deagle et al 2010). So, I think the above statement should be more
conservative.
Methods
Line 104-105: “The digestion rates of different cohorts are largely unknown for this species,
therefore samples were collected over 4-6 day time period to ensure that this did not bias results.
Captive trials using little penguins (Eudyptula minor), found that prey could be detected for up
to four days after ingestion”
This really needs a better explanation. Did you collect the same breeders, chicks and non-breeders
over 4-6 days? Or did you collect samples overall for 4-6 days. I don’t understand how you avoid
digestion biases in this way.
Line 112-113: “A DNA region of the 140 bp from the 3´end of the nuclear large subunit ribosomal
RNA gene….”
4
Large ribosomal subunit? The paper from which the primers were taken from (Jarman et al 2013)
says SSU and the database used to identify sequences is the SILVA SSU database. So I am
assuming you actually amplified the small ribosomal subunit?
Line 135-137: “Identification of MOTUs was done to the taxonomic groups previously defined in
Jarman et al 2013, which were generally at family level for prey”
Again, the 90% similarity threshold deserves a better explanation. There is no mention on the
prey groups identified in Jarman et al 2013 and the families analysed in this study. Does Jarman
et al 2013 include all possible prey groups of Adelie penguins (how many?) why most are family
groups??? Why not use a much higher similarity threshold, generally corresponding to species
level to define a MOTU, then BLAST them against the Silva database and depending on the
assignments pool them into major prey groups afterwards?
Line: “prey groups with <2% of sequences were combined into the group “other”
I am not sure if this is a good approach as you are pooling completely different prey groups into
a single one and doing your statistical analysis on this group. Probably a better approach is to
eliminate these rare taxa or to maintain them separately for statistical analyses.
Results
Line 159-162: 563 scats….with 373 collected from Béchervaise Islands and 198 collected at
Whitney Point. 67% of samples successfully amplified….allowing 378 samples to be analysed”
The authors should specify the number of samples successfully amplified for each cohort and site
referring also to the table.
Line 187-189: ”…interaction term between breeding stage and cohort..”
If I understood it correctly samples from Whitney Point were also taken at different years: Mid
brood guard 2012 and mid chréche 2013? Yet this was not taken into account. The authors should
mention why this is not a potential confounding effect.
Line 205:” .whereas at Whitney Point the diet was dominated by krill…”
Again a different year was included that might potentially explain these differences

Abstract: As Central Place Foragers, breeding penguins must balance energetic gain from self-
feeding with the costs of returning to provision young confined to a breeding site. Non-breeding
birds without the high energy demands of provisioning, may consume different prey to breeders.
Stomach contents analysis via stomach lavage has been the main technique used to assess
penguin diet, however can only identify provisioning diet. We used DNA dietary analysis to
determine if there was a difference in provisioning and self-feeding diet by identifying prey DNA
in scat samples from breeding and chick Adélie penguins at two locations in East Antarctica. We
also investigated diet differences between breeders and non-breeders at one site. Although
previous work shows changing foraging behaviour between chick provisioning and self-feeding
stages, our results suggest no significant differences in the main prey groups consumed by chicks
and breeders at either site or between breeding stages. This may reflect the inability of penguins
to selectively forage when provisioning, or resources were sufficient for all foraging needs.
Conversely, non-breeders were found to consume different prey groups to breeders, which may
reflect less restricted foraging ranges, the breeders actively selecting particular prey during
breeding or reduced foraging experience of the non-breeders.

Abstract: As Central Place Foragers, breeding penguins are restricted in foraging range by the
need to return to the colony to feed chicks. Furthermore, breeding birds must balance energetic
gain from self-feeding with the costs of returning to provision young. Non-breeding birds,
however, are likely to be less restricted in foraging range and lack the high energy demands of
provisioning, therefore may consume different prey to breeders. We used DNA dietary analysis
to determine if there was a difference in provisioning and self-feeding diet by identifying prey
DNA in scat samples from breeding and chick Adélie penguins at two locations in East
Antarctica. We also investigated diet differences between breeders and non-breeders at one site.
Although previous work shows changing foraging behaviour between chick provisioning and
self-feeding, our results suggest no significant differences in the main prey groups consumed by
chicks and breeders at either site or between breeding stages. This may reflect the inability of
penguins to selectively forage when provisioning, or resources were sufficient for all foraging
needs. Conversely, non-breeders were found to consume different prey groups to breeders,
which may reflect less restricted foraging ranges, breeders actively selecting particular prey
during breeding or reduced foraging experience of non-breeders.

Review 1:
The introductory summary of foraging theory, the comments on central-place foraging in
particular, remain insufficiently careful. LL 17-20: central-place foraging models do not imply (nor
do they exclude) the possibility of a parent’s “balancing” its own feeding with provisioning
dependent offspring. More importantly, Gould and Lewontin’s “spandrels” paper belittled optimal
foraging models as suggesting that adaptation produces foragers that maximize energy gain and
minimize expenditure (energy or time). A “panglossian” notion is neither a premise nor conclusion
of foraging theory, yet LL 34 and 35 seem to say so. This exemplifies what I mean by careless
statements. The more mechanical aspects, such as depletion of food near the breeding colony
increasing the distance per trip, seem correctly presented to me. Chapter 3 in Stephens and Krebs
(1986) discusses constraints on central-place foragers. It offers excellent guidance toward a careful
summary of the objectives, constraints and solutions to central-place problems.
We appreciate the constructive feedback on this and the recommended paper. We agree with
this reviewer's interpretation of the theory and have amended the text to reflect this.
We have made alterations in the text as follows:
Lines 17-21 As central place foragers, breeding penguins are restricted in foraging range by the
need to return to the colony to feed chicks. Furthermore, breeding birds must balance energetic
gain from self-feeding with the costs of returning to provision young. Non-breeding birds,
however, are likely to be less restricted in foraging range and lack the high energy demands of
provisioning, therefore may consume different prey to breeders.
Lines 33-36 Many animals are restricted in their foraging range during breeding, as they must
return to a central place, such as a nest or den. These limitations placed on central place foragers
means that individuals must determine the optimal foraging strategy to maximise patch time and
prey selection (Orians and Pearson 1979).
L84: I suggest specifying what “prey differences” means more concretely.
We have clarified this point.
Lines 85-87
This study uses a DNA-based diet approach to identify if there are any differences in the
proportion of major prey groups consumed by breeding and chick Adélie penguins at two sites in
east Antarctica; and breeding and non-breeding birds at one of these sites.
LL110, 111: Avoid the repetitive phrasing.
We have corrected this and lines 110-111 now read:
DNA amplification and sequencing of samples were carried out as described in Jarman et al [21].
In brief, DNA was extracted from faecal samples using a Promega ‘Maxwell 16' instrument and a
Maxwell® 16 Tissue DNA Purification Kit.

I suggest deleting the paragraph extending from L 253 to L260. It doesn’t add anything useful.
We have left this in the manuscript as Reviewer 2 discussed the importance of this part of the
manuscript in their review.
Species names aren’t italicized in the bibliography (should they be?).
Fixed.
There are too many references for such a short paper.
We have reduced the number of references by eight.
My concerns can be addressed with a little study and then revising.
Reviewer: 2
The authors used HTS on scats to determine the diet among different cohorts of Adelie penguins.
A similar study has been already conducted on Adelie penguins by Jarman et al 2013 using same
methodological approaches. The authors found, however, contrasting results with former studies
describing significant segregation among breeders and chicks during the breeding season. Another
interesting point of the paper is the comparison between the diet of breeders and non-breeders,
which have been rarely assessed in seabirds with other tools than stable isotope analysis and data
loggers. With this said, there seem to be also some important methodological shortcomings that
difficult interpretations.
The most obvious one, is the fact that differences among cohorts are interpreted solely based on
the proportion of sequences of pre-defined prey groups found in the scats of Adelie penguins.
There are many studies including the one cited by the authors (Deagle et al. 2010) that clearly
show that the number of sequences obtained in scats might differ substantially from the actual
proportion of items given to penguins. Moreover, to interpret differences in the proportions of
sequences obtained among scats most studies have used different methodological approaches
including real time PCR to control for PCR amplification biases (resulting from higher specificity of
primers to certain prey groups) or used different molecular markers.
There are certainly absolute differences in the prey species DNA sequences returned in diet per
unit biomass. In this paper, however, we focus on relative differences in prey sequence numbers
recovered from scats at the population level. This approach is common for any biased dietary
analysis method and for many other biased estimators in a wide variety of scientific fields. This
reviewer's opinion on this is a commonly held misconception on the application of these methods
DNA metabarcoding with relative quantification include Willerslev et al. (2014) and Thomsen et
al. (2012), which indicates that this view is far from universal.
We have added this to the text to reflect this information:
Lines 62-64 Molecular analysis of faecal DNA can identify prey sequences in scats (Pompanon et
al. 2012), which reflects the relative proportions of prey ingested (Deagle et al. 2005). This does
not necessarily equate to biomass (Deagle et al. 2010), however comparison of relative
proportions is a widely accepted approach in molecular studies (Thomsen et al. 2012, Willerslev et
al. 2014).
These biases might be even more aggravated when comparing chicks and adults as their scats are
probably much more degraded. (undergoing digestion processes in parents and chicks). Chicks are
also known to accumulate various prey remains in their stomach contents that are difficult to
digest, which can confound results when working with DNA analysis on scats.
Our results are not consistent with this potential bias. In fact, one of the main points of the paper
is that chick and breeding adult diet are almost indistinguishable at the level of analysis that we
implemented.
Despite these biases, it is also true that the authors did not find significant differences among
cohorts, which would be probably expected given differences in digestion and DNA degradation in
scats? In any case, the authors should be giving a much higher emphasis to these methodological
constraints in the ms, while explaining why such biases unlikely influenced their results, especially
as differences are reported for breeders and non-breeders.
This is a constructive suggestion and we have modified the text here to emphasise these points as
suggested
Lines 298-303
As with most dietary analysis methods, there are potential biases that could be affecting our
results. Possible biases may be arise from differential digestion rates between age cohorts and the
effect of DNA degradation in scats. It is possible that the observed difference between breeders
and non-breeders prey sequences could be exacerbated if these biases did exist, however the fact
that the prey sequences between chicks and adults was indistinguishable suggests that this bias is
unlikely to be an issue in this study.
Another shortcoming is the actual genetic marker used and its poor taxonomic discrimination
performance. There have been other markers used in penguins diet that discriminate prey at
species and genus level. In fact, as also acknowledged by the authors, differences among adults
and chicks may occur among prey species of the same taxonomic group, and not among broad
taxonomic groups. There is also no explanations why the authors opted to do so given other
available markers. In my point of view this renders the ms very descriptive confounding further
interpretations.
used to analyse penguin diet that do provide species-level information can only do it for a very
limited taxonomic range of prey items. As we have previously used this marker to demonstrate
the importance of soft-bodied prey groups such as Scyphozoa in the diet of Adelie penguins
(Jarman et al. 2013) it would make no sense to revert to molecular markers that only detect and
identify fish or crustaceans. Marker choice is a contentious issue in DNA metabarcoding studies
and our group has recently reviewed some of the issues (Deagle et al. 2014). In the current
study, our conclusions are justified by the evidence we present. A different choice of markers
would produce slightly different evidence, but it wouldn't be contradictory and given the
importance of soft-bodied prey, would likely not be as comprehensive as the evidence we have
presented here. In the paper we discussed that future work could focus on more specific prey
types, however the broad approach we used is the first step to identify which prey groups are
important for each cohort.
Another issue in my point of view is that it is difficult to follow why the authors opted for specific
methodological approaches. For example, why did the authors opted to group sequences into
MOTUs at 90% of similarity threshold? There is very little explanation on the actual discrimination
performance of the primers used. There is even no mention on the exact region of the non-coding
SSU region amplified in prey. I understand that the primers and methodologies used follow those
of Jarman et al 2013, still there needs to be a mention on why those are indicated for this study.
The methodology and the choices behind it are as this reviewer recognises described in more
detail in a previous study and we did not want to repeat too much of that in order to keep this
publication concise. However, as it is not clear enough, we have clarified the reasoning here:
Lines 141-144:
A 90% cut-off of MOTU’s was used to allow taxonomic discrimination between prey groups to
family level. Higher level taxonomic assignment was not possible for most of these broad groups
because of limited variation in the ‘V9 region’ of the of the SSU rRNA gene.
And referenced the region here:
Lines 118-120
“A DNA region of ~140 bp from the 3’ end of the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA gene was
amplified with primers that are conserved among most eukaryotes (primers available in (Jarman
et al. 2013)).”
Minor comments
Introduction
Line 61-62: “Molecular analysis of faecal DNA can identify prey sequences in scats, which reflects
the relative proportions of prey ingested
Feeding trials showed that the most abundant taxa fed to penguins were the most represented
sequences in penguins scats. However, sequences of three other fish fed in constant mass
proportions were all detected, but proportions of sequences were considerably different than
conservative.
We have amended this to specifically refer to relative proportions.
Lines 62-63:
Molecular analysis of faecal DNA can identify prey sequences in predator scats (Pompanon et al.
2012), from this we can identify the relative proportion of each prey group (Deagle et al. 2005).
Methods
Line 104-105: “The digestion rates of different cohorts are largely unknown for this species,
therefore samples were collected over 4-6 day time period to ensure that this did not bias results.
Captive trials using little penguins (Eudyptula minor), found that prey could be detected for up to
four days after ingestion”
This really needs a better explanation. Did you collect the same breeders, chicks and non-breeders
over 4-6 days? Or did you collect samples overall for 4-6 days. I don’t understand how you avoid
digestion biases in this way.
I appreciate that this sentence may be unclear, as scats from the same individuals weren’t
collected at multiple times. I hope the rewording makes it clearer to the reader.
Lines 106-113
“Samples were collected randomly throughout the colony across a 4-6 day time period to ensure
that any short-term changes in the diet at the population level would be incorporated, however it
still represents a discrete time period with which to compare to another breeding stage. The
digestion rates of different cohorts are largely unknown for this species, however we believe this is
unlikely to be an issue as the time period of collection would have represented multiple foraging
trips across the population, as trip duration was generally less than 4 days. Captive trials using
little penguins (Eudyptula minor), found that prey could be detected for up to four days after
ingestion”
Line 112-113: “A DNA region of the 140 bp from the 3´end of the nuclear large subunit ribosomal
RNA gene….”
Large ribosomal subunit? The paper from which the primers were taken from (Jarman et al 2013)
says SSU and the database used to identify sequences is the SILVA SSU database. So I am assuming
you actually amplified the small ribosomal subunit?
Corrected.
Line 135-137: “Identification of MOTUs was done to the taxonomic groups previously defined in
Jarman et al 2013, which were generally at family level for prey”
Again, the 90% similarity threshold deserves a better explanation. There is no mention on the prey
2013 include all possible prey groups of Adelie penguins (how many?) why most are family
groups??? Why not use a much higher similarity threshold, generally corresponding to species
level to define a MOTU, then BLAST them against the Silva database and depending on the
assignments pool them into major prey groups afterwards?
As for a previous comment, we have included further explanation in the text as to the rationale
for the 90% cut off. The prey groups were compiled from the clusters that were matched with
the silva database as described in the methods. This is the same approach as Jarman et al 2013,
however, I have removed the sentence that has been referred to in the above comment
(Line135-137) as I can see it has caused confusion for the reader.
The reviewer has said there is no mention of the families analysed in this study, however they can
be found in Supp Table 1, which is referenced in the following paragraph. I have included an
additional reference to this table in the opening paragraph (Line 151) so it isn’t missed by other
readers.
Line: “prey groups with <2% of sequences were combined into the group “other”
I am not sure if this is a good approach as you are pooling completely different prey groups into a
single one and doing your statistical analysis on this group. Probably a better approach is to
eliminate these rare taxa or to maintain them separately for statistical analyses.
We have taken the reviewers advice on this and re-ran the analysis with only the prey groups that
had >2% of sequences. i.e. we didn’t analyse the ‘other’ group. This did not change the results
much as the ‘other’ group contained a very small number of sequences.
Results
Line 159-162: 563 scats….with 373 collected from Béchervaise Islands and 198 collected at
Whitney Point. 67% of samples successfully amplified….allowing 378 samples to be analysed”
The authors should specify the number of samples successfully amplified for each cohort and site
referring also to the table.
We have put this in as a table with the proportion of samples successful (new Table 1).
Line 187-189: ”…interaction term between breeding stage and cohort..”
If I understood it correctly samples from Whitney Point were also taken at different years: Mid
brood guard 2012 and mid chréche 2013? Yet this was not taken into account. The authors should
mention why this is not a potential confounding effect.
Line 205:” .whereas at Whitney Point the diet was dominated by krill…”
Again a different year was included that might potentially explain these differences
All samples were collected during the 2012/13 breeding season, therefore December 2012
(brood) and January 2013 (crèche). This is detailed in the methods and was misread by the
reviewer.
As per original manuscript:
Island-January 4-7th 2013, Whitney Point 23- 28th December 2012) and mid crèche (23-26th
January 2013).
