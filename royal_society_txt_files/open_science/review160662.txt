In this paper Hobson and Bishop review the literature on mu suppression in adults. Firstly, I
should comment that this is an excellent review of this field and not only did I enjoy reading it
but I learned a lot too. The authors systematically review the existing literature of mu
suppression and in particular critically examine the evidence that has been put forward about mu
suppression in language, as a marker for mirror neutrons and in autism. The review makes for
uncomfortable reading for anyone who works in this field but the criticisms are justified and I
think this paper will hopefully be seen by all as a scholarly and kindly reminder that those that
work in this field need to think more carefully about confounding explanations of their results. I
really have very little to comment on or suggestions for improvement. I think it would be really
helpful if the authors were able to pull together in a succinct paragraph or table what
experimenters should do in the future to avoid the problems that plague the existing literature
e.g. larger sample sizes, show scalp topographies? better control experiments etc. I think this
would be useful for the reader. At the moment the paper is correctly critical of the previous work
but I think it might help to soften some of the criticism to see a positive message or ideas of how
work in the field could improve. The information is there I think but I feel it could be better
highlighted

Review of RSOS-160662
Summary: This review paper covers the usefulness of the alpha band of the mu rhythm in
measuring the role of the human mirror neuron system in a variety of cognitive processes. A
subset of published studies measuring mu rhythms is reviewed and limitations of these studies
(most common to all neuroscience research) are discussed.
3
General Comments: The current title does not reflect the focus of this paper which is limited to
an interpretation of the alpha band of the mu rhythm and how suppression of this part of the mu
may (or may not) be interpreted in light of activity in the human mirror neuron system. These
authors recently published a paper with a title that would be more appropriate (Hobson and
Bishop, 2016). The current title suggests the evolution of the mu rhythm (in its entirety not just
the alpha portion) will be discussed relative to broader sensorimotor integration (not just mirror
neurons) during various human cognitive processes with reflection on the future applicability of
the mu rhythm in neuroscience research.
Though the authors site the recent meta-analysis by Fox (2015), it is not clear how the current
paper expands the literature other than adding discussion of some studies that focus on speech
processing and “going beyond action understanding.” The same potential limitations of mu
rhythm studies are cited in both papers (underpowered, lack of appropriate control conditions,
controlling for general attention, analyzing data on central electrode channels only). The
approach the authors took of citing a study, then outlining the limitations (usually relative to the
flaws addressed above) and dismissing most of the conclusions became tiresome by around page
24. Is there a more efficient/interesting way to do this for better engagement of the readers?
An entire section of the mu rhythm (the beta band) is ignored in this review despite the fact that
both Fox (2015), these authors (Hobson and Bishop, 2016), and others (e.g., Coude et al., 2014;
Niedermeyer and da Silva, 2005) conclude that alpha and beta ranges must be considered when
interpreting mu rhythm activity. Particularly when attempting to measure mirror neuron system
activity, distinct but cooperating alpha (reflecting sensory) and beta (reflecting motor) mu should
be included.
I’m unclear what the purpose of the manuscript is. The authors spend a considerable amount of
time pointing out potential methodological flaws in a subset of previous mu suppression studies,
taking these potential methodological flaws as license to ignore the reported findings, even when
the flaws were overcome or reduced with additional methodological techniques. While they
make a case that mu suppression is not a valid measure of mirror neuron system activity, no
attempt is given to provide an alternative explanation of mu suppression or metric of mirror
neuron system activity. Nor are their alternative suggestions for what mu suppression may
reflect.
Specific Comments:
Section 1 – History of mu:
• If the intent is to give a history of mu, the literature discussed seems insufficient, and
stops about a decade ago when proposals for a link to mirror neuron systems were made. There
is 10 years of additional research using mu measures to reflect broader sensorimotor processes.
Also, there is no mention of the fact that mirror neuron system activity is weak in humans.
• The way this is written, it would lead the reader to believe that the field of cognitive
neuroscience largely agrees that the mu rhythm is a measure of the mirror neuron system. No
mention is given of sensorimotor processing.
• No mention is made of the beta band at all, leading the reader to believe that the field
agrees that the mu rhythm consists only of alpha band activity. Recent studies that still favor the
MNS interpretation of the mu rhythm are discussing beta band activity (Coude et al., 2014). This
should be at least addressed.
• In a previous manuscript published this year, the authors have described the nature of
the mu rhythm as consisting of peaks in both the alpha and beta frequency ranges (Niedermeyer
and da Silva, 2005;Hobson and Bishop, 2016), and suggest that activity in both frequency ranges
must be considered when characterizing mu activity. However, based on the description of the
mu rhythm in the first section of the paper, it would appear that they are now considering only
the alpha band. Perhaps the authors could give a rationale for considering the alpha band only,
4
or nuance the description of the mu rhythm such that it is clear that not all authors agree with
their description.
Section 2 – Mu as a measure of the MNS:
• I am unclear whether the authors’ discussion of statistical power is relevant
o I don’t know if the G*Power calculator that they used was designed to deal with
electrophysiological data
o In EEG studies, each trial is a data point, not just each subject. Does this change the
interpretation at all?
• The authors cite a lack of clarity on what constitutes the frequency range of the mu
rhythm as a weakness in mu studies, then propose no definition of the mu rhythm. Additionally,
there are no studies cited to highlight this variability in definition of the mu rhythm. Nor are
there studies cited that may have selected such a narrow frequency band for analysis that it
would clip the data if there was a small range of individual variability in peak alpha (1 – 2 Hz).
• The authors additionally identify the problem of corrections for multiple comparisons as
a weakness in mu studies. This would lead the reader to believe that this is 1) a problem of which
the field is unaware and 2) something that only affects mu studies. Neither of these assertions are
true.
1. The need to correct for multiple comparisons is widely known throughout the field of
neuroscience and multiple methods for dealing with it exist (Maris and Oostenveld, 2007).
2. This is a general neuroscience issue, not something specific to mu studies. If the authors
believe this is something that has confounded mu studies specifically, perhaps they could
identify a few studies pertaining to mu suppression in which the multiple comparisons problem
has not been addressed.
• When discussing the problem of alpha, the authors state that the main distinguishing
features of mu from the occipital alpha rhythm are topography and responsiveness. While I do
not disagree, this only applies to studies that are operating in channel space. Studies that have
used blind source separation techniques such as independent component analysis (ICA) should
not be susceptible.
• Discussion of alpha power and attention really only applies to a block design, where one
condition is compared to another. If the design is event related, wherein a baseline window is
used to measure enhancement or suppression during a task, this isn’t relevant.
Section 3 – Mu beyond action understanding:
• Section 3.1 is titled “mu suppression during language tasks,” but the vast majority of the
discussion focuses on speech. As speech and language are distinct processes, this should either
be broken up into two different sections or given a different title.
• In discussion of Cuellar et al. and Bowers et al., the current authors question whether
these studies were confounded by task demands as mu suppression was only found during the
most demanding tasks. Rather than being problematic, this may be interpreted to suggest that
the mu rhythm does not engage unless the task is demanding enough. If they are asserting that
the mu rhythm indexes MNS activity (which appears to be the assumption of the current review),
then this is troublesome. However, it is fully consistent with dorsal stream processing accounts
of the mu rhythm.
• In a previous paper, the authors described the mu rhythm as consisting of both alpha
and beta peaks. However, in discussion of Bowers et al., they ignore the main finding of the
study, citing the presence of an experimental effect in the beta range.
• I would like to see the authors at least briefly mention what ICA is, the advantages of
ICA, and what it enables rather than casually mention it as different analytic approach. It would
seem important to allow that ICA overcomes a limitation cited by the authors (volume
conduction) by creating temporally independent and spatially fixed sources of activity in which
mu rhythms can be separated from other alpha rhythms. (See Stone, 2004; Onton et al., 2006;
Hari, 2006; Pineda, 2005.)
• Similarly, the authors do not appear to understand event-related spectral perturbation
(ERSPs), don’t explain it, the advantages of this type of analysis and how it overcomes other
limitations cited by the authors (including but not limited to a true trail by trial baseline,
5
measuring fluctuations in oscillatory power across specific events to reveal changes in cortical
processing across time).
• The authors highlight the need for a study that deals with mu suppression in speech
perception and production together (page 17), then cite and ignore the findings of a study that
did just that (Jenson et al., 2014). Their rationale is that the paper’s discussion mentions that their
results are in accord with both attention and cognitive processes, not just motor processes. The
authors would be hard pressed to find a study that was not affected by attention and cognitive
processes, so using that as a rationale not to discuss the findings of Jenson et al. seems ill advised.
• On page eighteen, the authors mention that beta was modulated by the cloze probability
of the sentence stimuli. I once again submit that the authors are limiting the discussion of the mu
rhythm by only addressing the alpha band.
• The authors are essentially discussing Constructivism and Direct Realism. Perhaps a
mention of these two paradigms would be illustrative.
• Page 20 – I don’t know what the authors mean by a “pre-registered design.”
• It is unclear how the findings on prejudice/racism reported in section 3.2.1 support the
notion of mu rhythm involvement in the MNS. Rather, they appear to suggest that mu
suppression represents a top-down modulatory effect on an underlying process.
• At the end of section 3.2.4 the authors state that there may be no need to appeal to a
mirror neuron theory account as alternative accounts could explain the results. It would be
informative if the authors identified what these alternative theories are.
• Section 3.3 – The authors seem to suggest that the presence of alpha suppression in
frontal and/or occipital sites negates the presence of mu suppression. These are not mutually
exclusive phenomena, and I believe it is an over-simplification to use the presence of one as a
reason to ignore the other.

Dear Prof. Vidding,
We wish to thank both the editorial team and two reviewers for their comments on our manuscript.
Please find detailed below our point-by-point responses to the issues raised by the reviewers. For each
point, we have numbered the reviewer’s comment, and our reply.
Reviewer 1
1.1 I think it would be really helpful if the authors were able to pull together in a succinct paragraph or
table what experimenters should do in the future to avoid the problems that plague the existing
literature e.g. larger sample sizes, show scalp topographies? better control experiments etc. I think
this would be useful for the reader. At the moment the paper is correctly critical of the previous work
but I think it might help to soften some of the criticism to see a positive message or ideas of how work
in the field could improve. The information is there I think but I feel it could be better highlighted.
1.1 Reply - We have added a table to our final section that includes the considerations we suggest future
researchers wishing to use mu suppression make. We have also added some more points to our
discussion about alternative metrics for mirror neuron system measurement, and points regarding future
work on new analytical techniques, which help to end the manuscript on a constructive note.
Reviewer 2
2.1 General Comments: The current title does not reflect the focus of this paper which is limited to an
interpretation of the alpha band of the mu rhythm and how suppression of this part of the mu may (or
may not) be interpreted in light of activity in the human mirror neuron system. These authors recently
published a paper with a title that would be more appropriate (Hobson and Bishop, 2016). The current
title suggests the evolution of the mu rhythm (in its entirety not just the alpha portion) will be
discussed relative to broader sensorimotor integration (not just mirror neurons) during various human
cognitive processes with reflection on the future applicability of the mu rhythm in neuroscience
research.
2.1 Reply - We suggest a new title to make clearer the focus of the paper on mirror neuron-related
theory: “The interpretation of mu suppression as an index of mirror neuron activity: past, present and
future”. As outlined in our replies to other comments below, while we do not disagree that beta is of
course a component of mu-waves, in our review of the literature the majority of studies treat mu as
alpha-band activity arising from the sensorimotor scalp. We therefore propose to retain “mu” in the title,
especially at it is these researchers for whom we feel this article is especially important for.
2.2 Though the authors site the recent meta-analysis by Fox (2015), it is not clear how the current
paper expands the literature other than adding discussion of some studies that focus on speech
processing and “going beyond action understanding.” The same potential limitations of mu rhythm
studies are cited in both papers (underpowered, lack of appropriate control conditions, controlling for
general attention, analyzing data on central electrode channels only). The approach the authors took
of citing a study, then outlining the limitations (usually relative to the flaws addressed above) and
dismissing most of the conclusions became tiresome by around page 24. Is there a more
efficient/interesting way to do this for better engagement of the readers?
2.2 Reply - We believe the review is an important expansion of the literature; the studies reviewed by
Fox et al. and this review are almost entirely non-overlapping, so it is certainly not the case that we are
covering the same ground. The Fox et al. meta-analysis was an important article, but by virtue of
choosing to do a meta-analysis the authors had to limit themselves to a set of studies that were
sufficiently similar as to be able to be statistically analysed with meta-analytic techniques. Selecting only
action-observation studies, while necessary for the meta-analysis, does not capture the range of studies
that are using mu suppression to index MNS activity. As clearly shown by our review, mu suppression is
being used in very diverse ways, but its use is not being tempered by the necessary cautions we consider.
Given the diversity of studies, we believe it is necessary to consider the investigations from an
individualistic stand-point, as there is not, we believe, a “one-size-fits-all” design for using mu
suppression, and what/how certain factors (including but by no means limited to attention) are
controlled will of course be dependent upon the study and experimental questions. Nonetheless, as
suggested by Rev 1, we have added a table summarising our key cautions for mu suppression
researchers. For readers who find our narrative review too cumbersome, this may provide an easy way
to access our main points.
2.3 - An entire section of the mu rhythm (the beta band) is ignored in this review despite the fact that
both Fox (2015), these authors (Hobson and Bishop, 2016), and others (e.g., Coude et al., 2014;
Niedermeyer and da Silva, 2005) conclude that alpha and beta ranges must be considered when
interpreting mu rhythm activity. Particularly when attempting to measure mirror neuron system
activity, distinct but cooperating alpha (reflecting sensory) and beta (reflecting motor) mu should be
included.
2.3 Reply - The reviewer raises an excellent point and we believe highlights our own concern that the
definition of mu is not consistent within the literature. Certainly mu rhythms are considered to be
composed of both alpha- and beta-components. However, of the 26 papers in the review, only 8
consider beta, and none of the ASD papers do. Thus, it is quite fair to say that the main focus on “mu
suppression” in studies of language, social processes and autism has been on the alpha-mu band. In fact,
of the remaining papers, many do not even mention “beta”, never mind analyse the data from this band.
Therefore, researchers considering mu in autism and mu in other domains may be talking about quite
different EEG phenomena. One could argue that beta has been neglected in the mu suppression
literature. However, we would be cautious about recommending that all studies examine it in
conjunction with mu, as analysing multiple frequency bands gives authors more scope for committing
Type 1 error. We have noted that mu rhythms are composed of beta and alpha-band components on
page 9, better highlighted significant beta findings in several studies, and also revisited the notion of
examining beta rather than alpha-mu activity in the discussion (page 35).
2.4 - I’m unclear what the purpose of the manuscript is. The authors spend a considerable amount of
time pointing out potential methodological flaws in a subset of previous mu suppression studies,
taking these potential methodological flaws as license to ignore the reported findings, even when the
flaws were overcome or reduced with additional methodological techniques.
2.4 Reply - Currently, in our introduction (page 3) we list 3 key aims: a) to give a brief overview of the
history of mu; b) to consider whether mu suppression studies are a sufficiently reliable and valid
technique to infer MNS involvement; and c) to consider whether mu suppression studies can throw light
on these putative functions of the MNS in language, social processes and autism. For clarity, we have
reiterated these aims and explicitly addressed them in our final discussion section.
The reviewer is concerned that we are ignoring individual studies, that do not have major
methodological flaws, that have found positive effects. There are some notable cases, which we
commend in our review, where methodological flaws are addressed. Reviewer 1 was also concerned that
the review was perhaps overly negative. We have sought to highlight the good practice has been
conducted. Nonetheless, we would argue that the current state of the literature does make it very
difficult to draw conclusions about mirror neuron involvement in the processes discussed here.
Furthermore, in cases where we felt methodological flaws we addressed, mu suppression effects in
keeping with MNS-hypotheses seem to be generally removed. These examples include:
- Silas et al. (Section 3.2.1, page 23), corrected for multiple comparisons when investigating the
link between mu suppression and individual differences in empathy, and found no significant
associations.
- Dumas et al (2014) (Section 3.3, page 32) presented both conventional analyses and whole brain
analyses and demonstrated that alpha-band differences between typical controls and ASD
participants were not driven my central sites, and source analyses suggested significant
suppression effects were arising from occipital sources.
2.5 While they make a case that mu suppression is not a valid measure of mirror neuron system
activity, no attempt is given to provide an alternative explanation of mu suppression or metric of
mirror neuron system activity. Nor are their alternative suggestions for what mu suppression may
reflect.
2.5 Reply - We feel that the manuscript in its original form does give alternative explanations for mu
suppression effects throughout the paper:
- In the speech/language section, we note the limited study of perception and production
together, meaning that different processes could support perception and production, which
would undermine the mirror neuron account. We also point out that motor activation during
perception could be quite easily accounted for by associative accounts and that mu suppression
may not be reflecting anything functionally crucial for language processes whatsoever.
- In the social processes section, we point out that automatic mimicry effects and attentional
differences to social stimuli could account for increased mu suppression in certain conditions.
- In the section on autism, we note that very general differences in alpha-band activity across the
head could account for proposed mu suppression differences, and that attentional effects have
not been sufficiently ruled out.
As to alternative metrics, we believe that the Coll et al. (2015) technique of repetition suppression is a
relatively good experimental technique that at least attempts to deal with the issue of whether mu
suppression in observation and execution conditions is reflecting the activity of the same populations of
neurons. Other proposed measures of MNS activity include changes to MEPs during TMS investigations –
this may provide an alternative metric, although fully understanding the strengths and limitations of this
alternative method would really merit a separate review and we are hesitant to recommend TMS over
and above mu suppression. As noted by the reviewer, potentially beta-band rather than alpha-band
activity could pose a better index of MNS activity. We have noted repetition suppression, beta
suppression and TMS in Section 4.0.
2.6 Section 1 – History of mu:
If the intent is to give a history of mu, the literature discussed seems insufficient, and stops about a
decade ago when proposals for a link to mirror neuron systems were made. There is 10 years of
additional research using mu measures to reflect broader sensorimotor processes. Also, there is no
mention of the fact that mirror neuron system activity is weak in humans. The way this is written, it
would lead the reader to believe that the field of cognitive neuroscience largely agrees that the mu
rhythm is a measure of the mirror neuron system. No mention is given of sensorimotor processing.
2.6 Reply - We assume by “the fact that mirror neuron system activity is weak in humans” the reviewer
meant that detection of mirroring processes with EEG will be challenging, given the myriad of other
processes that an EEG will also reflect (not that mirror neuron system activity is weak in humans
comparative to other species?). We do not disagree with this point – mu suppression experiments are
effectively trying to extract a signal out from other co-occurring but non-MNS related processes involved
in action and observation, arguably no mean feat – we have added this point to this section (top page
10).
In the original version of the manuscript, the intent was to portray that up until the last 20 years mu
suppression was largely described as a measure of sensorimotor engagement, but that the narrative
shifted with the rise in popularity of MNS based theories. We of course acknowledge that not all papers
have agreed that mu suppression indexes mirror neuron activity. To this end, we have included a brief
mention of our own recent investigation (Hobson and Bishop 2016) and a recent, innovative paper by
Coll et al. (2015) that suggests that mu suppression may be indexing sensory processes, not motor
mirroring processes as suggested by some. We hope that this will add balance to this section and
highlight to the reader the differing views about mu suppression as an index of the MNS.
2.7 No mention is made of the beta band at all, leading the reader to believe that the field agrees that
the mu rhythm consists only of alpha band activity. Recent studies that still favor the MNS
interpretation of the mu rhythm are discussing beta band activity (Coude et al., 2014). This should be
at least addressed.
In a previous manuscript published this year, the authors have described the nature of the mu rhythm
as consisting of peaks in both the alpha and beta frequency ranges (Niedermeyer and da Silva, 2005;
Hobson and Bishop, 2016), and suggest that activity in both frequency ranges must be considered
when characterizing mu activity. However, based on the description of the mu rhythm in the first
section of the paper, it would appear that they are now considering only the alpha band. Perhaps the
authors could give a rationale for considering the alpha band only, or nuance the description of the mu
rhythm such that it is clear that not all authors agree with their description.
2.7 Reply - Indeed, as the reviewer correctly points out, the mu rhythm is considered by many to
composed of both mu and beta components. As discussed briefly in Hobson and Bishop (2016), there has
been some suggestion that beta may be a better index of sensorimotor/MNS activity. However, Hobson
and Bishop (2016) actually failed to find any significant differences in beta between action-observation
and control conditions (this arguably was one of the most robust tests of beta to date, being from a
sample of 61 participants with a preregistered analysis plan). We agree with the reviewer that beta
should certainly be mentioned in the review and have added the point that mu rhythms are composed of
alpha and beta components to page 9, and in our conclusions noted that beta suppression could be an
alternative to conventional alpha-mu as an index of the MNS.
However, as highlighted above, the rationale behind the review was to examine the use of contemporary
mu suppression designs, and our review suggests that by and large researchers define (for better or
worse) mu as alpha-range activity. We do not expand our review to consider all studies examining beta
effects, as we do not believe this to be within our aims, and furthermore beta in MNS-related
investigations is studied in conjunction with alpha-mu, not by itself. We make clear that the studies
examined were not studies that exclusively investigated beta activity, on page 13.
A key point implied by this comment is that if researchers were examining beta instead, perhaps the
results would be different- if beta is a better measure of MNS activity, then perhaps studies examining
beta effects will fare beta than those examining mu in finding positive results. Of the studies in this
review that did consider beta, only a small proportion found results in keeping with the MNS-hypothesis
with beta when they did not with alpha-mu, and generally, beta results were either null, or similar to the
alpha-range results. Thus, this does not support the notion that the reason we find little is because we
are excluding beta-range activity.
2.8 - Section 2 – Mu as a measure of the MNS:
I am unclear whether the authors’ discussion of statistical power is relevant
I don’t know if the G*Power calculator that they used was designed to deal with electrophysiological
data
In EEG studies, each trial is a data point, not just each subject. Does this change the interpretation at
all?
2.8 Reply - We believe the discussion of statistical power is very relevant to assessing the quality of the
scientific merit of mu suppression studies. G*Power is a program that can calculate power for most
parametric statistical tests. In the vast majority of the EEG studies reviewed here, analyses were
conducted using ANOVA, t-tests and correlations, all of which G*Power is able to calculate power
statistic for. For other analyses admittedly it is not straightforward to calculate the power or sample size
requirements through G*Power.
To the reviewer’s third comment, power relates to the units of analysis, which in a typical mu
suppression study is a within-subjects ANOVA or similar; in these analyses, one number represents each
subject per condition. Mu suppression experiments are typically not ERP (event-related potential)
designs but ERD/S (event related desynchronization/synchronisation), but the main complications for
ERP analyses would be: a) if researchers look at several electrodes, they are typically highly
intercorrelated, and that means the sphericity assumptions are violated, which are typically handled
through Greenhouse-Geisser correction; b) ERP studies often include 3 or more factors in the ANOVA
which raises the probability of Type I error if any and all main effects and interactions are interpreted
without any correction for the number of tests (see Cramer et al, cited in the manuscript).
2.9 The authors cite a lack of clarity on what constitutes the frequency range of the mu rhythm as a
weakness in mu studies, then propose no definition of the mu rhythm. Additionally, there are no
studies cited to highlight this variability in definition of the mu rhythm. Nor are there studies cited
that may have selected such a narrow frequency band for analysis that it would clip the data if there
was a small range of individual variability in peak alpha (1 – 2 Hz).
2.9 Reply - In the original manuscript, we do state on page 1 that the mu rhythm is usually defined as the
frequency band between 8-13 Hz. Within our review, we found studies that analysed mu range of 8-12,
8-13 Hz, and 8-15, and studies that split the mu-band into upper and lower bands. We have added this
point to page 9, to highlight this variability. As to the reviewer’s point bout potential clipping, we believe
that this is dealt with by reporting the ranges that experiments employed.
2.10 The authors additionally identify the problem of corrections for multiple comparisons as a
weakness in mu studies. This would lead the reader to believe that this is 1) a problem of which the
field is unaware and 2) something that only affects mu studies. Neither of these assertions are true.
1. The need to correct for multiple comparisons is widely known throughout the field of
neuroscience and multiple methods for dealing with it exist (Maris and Oostenveld, 2007).
2. This is a general neuroscience issue, not something specific to mu studies. If the authors
believe this is something that has confounded mu studies specifically, perhaps they could identify a
few studies pertaining to mu suppression in which the multiple comparisons problem has not been
addressed.
2.10 Reply - We agree that this issue applies throughout the field of neuroscience, but we believe it is
important when examining the scientific rigour of a given technique to acknowledge where generally
poorer scientific practice may have held the field back. Furthermore, exploratory analyses of multiway
ANOVA in EEG were generally not corrected prior to the Cramer et al. (2014) paper, and indeed a recent
article by Luck and Gaspelin (2017) noted that even in papers published in the last few years these poor
statistical practices prevail in EEG research. The Luck and Gaspelin paper highlights the fact that these
issues are still prevalent, and we have added in reference to this useful article.
The original version of the manuscript did highlight cases where this is a problem, notably Perry et al.
(2010) (on p22) and Cheng et al. (2008) (p23). Rather than reiterate in detail these cases (which are
explored in their respective sections), we have instead added a note for readers to refer to the section in
which these cases can be found, to avoid repetition.
2.11 When discussing the problem of alpha, the authors state that the main distinguishing features of
mu from the occipital alpha rhythm are topography and responsiveness. While I do not disagree, this
only applies to studies that are operating in channel space. Studies that have used blind source
separation techniques such as independent component analysis (ICA) should not be susceptible.
2.11 Reply - Hypothetically, studies may be better protected from alpha confounding if working in source
space rather than channel space. For the vast majority of the studies reviewed here, analyses were
conducted in channel space. (We consider the reviewer’s other point on ICA further below.)
2.12 Discussion of alpha power and attention really only applies to a block design, where one
condition is compared to another. If the design is event related, wherein a baseline window is used to
measure enhancement or suppression during a task, this isn’t relevant.
2.12 Reply - Indeed, we are quite familiar with this issue, as this is primarily what the registered report by
Hobson and Bishop (2016) was concerned about. It is a good point made by the reviewer that if we are
concerned about alpha we should consider whether the studies reviewed used blocked baselines or not.
In fact, almost all of the studies reviewed used a block design (we noted 5 that did not). We have added
this point to p33.
2.13 Section 3 – Mu beyond action understanding:
Section 3.1 is titled “mu suppression during language tasks,” but the vast majority of the discussion
focuses on speech. As speech and language are distinct processes, this should either be broken up into
two different sections or given a different title.
2.13 Reply - We quite agree, and have renamed this section “Mu suppression during speech and
language tasks”.
2.14 In discussion of Cuellar et al. and Bowers et al., the current authors question whether these
studies were confounded by task demands as mu suppression was only found during the most
demanding tasks. Rather than being problematic, this may be interpreted to suggest that the mu
rhythm does not engage unless the task is demanding enough. If they are asserting that the mu
rhythm indexes MNS activity (which appears to be the assumption of the current review), then this is
troublesome. However, it is fully consistent with dorsal stream processing accounts of the mu rhythm.
2.14 Reply - In their account of dorsal and ventral processing streams of language, Hickok and Poeppel
(2004) argue that their proposed dorsal stream underpins auditory-motor integration, an important
process for infants’ acquisition of speech, and a process that continues to operate into adulthood.
However, they also argue that this stream is not likely to normally contribute to speech perception, but
may be utilised in more difficult environments, or when phonological memory is required (they argue
this stream is the basis for pSTM). Bowers et al. and Cuellar et al. both appeal to this framework, arguing
that their suppression results, as they are limited to speech in noise discrimination, reflect the activity of
this dorsal stream. In our original manuscript, we do make reference to the idea that motor processes
may act as an additional support for speech perception when the environment or task is more
demanding, in the summary section for speech and language processes. However, we agree that this is
an interesting account that certainly deserves more discussion, which we had added to the paragraph in
which these two studies are discussed.
2.15 In a previous paper, the authors described the mu rhythm as consisting of both alpha and beta
peaks. However, in discussion of Bowers et al., they ignore the main finding of the study, citing the
presence of an experimental effect in the beta range.
2.15 Reply - In our original manuscript, the beta effects reported in this study are mentioned. However,
we have rephrased this paragraph to be less negative, and note that is a key difference between the
Bower et al. and Cuellar et al. papers.
2.16 I would like to see the authors at least briefly mention what ICA is, the advantages of ICA, and
what it enables rather than casually mention it as different analytic approach. It would seem
important to allow that ICA overcomes a limitation cited by the authors (volume conduction) by
creating temporally independent and spatially fixed sources of activity in which mu rhythms can be
separated from other alpha rhythms. (See Stone, 2004; Onton et al., 2006; Hari, 2006; Pineda, 2005.)
2.16 Reply - In our original manuscript, we briefly discuss ICA on page 16, and refer readers to a review
on the topic for EEG. Only a few studies in the set reviewed used ICA (beyond extracting and removing
eye-blink artefacts). ICA may combat some of the issues related to alpha confounding, but it is not
without its own challenges, one of which is that the extracted components may differ from person to
person, making it difficult to generalise across participants, if ICA is done at the subject-level, and one of
the papers reviewed (Jenson et al., 2014) also made some very useful remarks about some of the
considerations researchers using this technique would need to make. So as not to interrupt the flow of
the narrative review, we dedicate more discussion space to ICA in our final section, rather than in the
section on speech and language.
2.17 Similarly, the authors do not appear to understand event-related spectral perturbation (ERSPs),
don’t explain it, the advantages of this type of analysis and how it overcomes other limitations cited
by the authors (including but not limited to a true trail by trial baseline, measuring fluctuations in
oscillatory power across specific events to reveal changes in cortical processing across time).
2.17 Reply - Only three studies in the set reviewed in the manuscript used ERSP analysis, hence its lack of
mention in our original manuscript. We have added a brief note on ERSP, in the discussion alongside our
point about ICA. Specifically, we note that ERSP techniques are described as generalised ERD (Event
related desynchronization i.e. subtraction) (see Makeig, 2004). The key differences between ERSP and
conventional subtraction methods are firstly that ERSP analyses use the baseline period immediately
before the period of interest (and hence use a trial-by-trial baseline that is preferable to the
blocked/whole condition baselines often employed in mu suppression studies – some non-ERSP mu
suppression studies do use within-trial baseline however e.g. Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2004, cited in
language section, and indeed our own Hobson and Bishop (2016) study). The second is that ERSP
analyses produce results that show changes in power across time. The third is that ERSP analyses
typically reveal changes in spectral power over a broad frequency range, rather than in typical
subtraction analyses were a frequency band is selected for analyses (or at least one band at a time is
examined e.g. the mu-alpha followed by the mu-beta, and so on). As we note in the revised review, the
method of using an immediately preceding period as baseline is logically similar to the approach in ERSP.
Functions for performing ERSP analyses in EEGlab offer many options for methods of frequency
decomposition, and it is as yet not clear which is the optimal one for demonstrating mu suppression. It
would be helpful to have studies that systematically compared different analytic approaches using data
that gave robust mu suppression (e.g. during movement) to establish a standard method, as the range of
possibilities currently available gives many researcher degrees of freedom, and this hinders reproducible
research.
2.18 The authors highlight the need for a study that deals with mu suppression in speech perception
and production together (page 17), then cite and ignore the findings of a study that did just that
(Jenson et al., 2014). Their rationale is that the paper’s discussion mentions that their results are in
accord with both attention and cognitive processes, not just motor processes. The authors would be
hard pressed to find a study that was not affected by attention and cognitive processes, so using that
as a rationale not to discuss the findings of Jenson et al. seems ill advised.
2.18 Reply - Our intention was not to ignore the results of this study, and indeed this paragraph is, we
think relatively positive about this study, and the limitations mentioned are those raised by the study’s
own authors. Clearly there is a lack of studies that have investigated production and perception of
speech using mu – Tamura et al. and Jenson et al. were the only studies identified, and thus there clearly
is a research gap here that deserves to be emphasised. We have rephrased this paragraph to highlight
this positive finding better, and reiterated its existence in our summary of this language section.
2.19 On page eighteen, the authors mention that beta was modulated by the cloze probability of the
sentence stimuli. I once again submit that the authors are limiting the discussion of the mu rhythm by
only addressing the alpha band.
2.19 Reply - We have adjusted the wording of this section to highlight better the significant beta effect.
2.20 The authors are essentially discussing Constructivism and Direct Realism. Perhaps a mention of
these two paradigms would be illustrative.
2.20 Reply - Direct Realism and constructivism relate to philosophical ideas about how we understand
the world (e.g. a direct realist would argue that a table is still a table whether or not we have the
semantic category of “table”). It is unclear how these topics relate to the ideas discussed in this section,
and we consider them to be beyond the scope of this review.
2.21 Page 20 – I don’t know what the authors mean by a “pre-registered design.”
2.21 Reply - Pre-registering experiments is an innovative means of tackling publication bias and
retrospective hypothesis fitting. We have added in some more clarification about pre-registering. We
also direct interested readers to a recent and thorough paper on reproducibility by Forstmeier et al.,
which includes details on replication and specifically pre-registration.
2.22 It is unclear how the findings on prejudice/racism reported in section 3.2.1 support the notion of
mu rhythm involvement in the MNS. Rather, they appear to suggest that mu suppression represents a
top-down modulatory effect on an underlying process.
2.22 Reply - Indeed, in our original summary of the mu suppression in social processes (section 3.2.4), we
make the suggestion that viewing ingroup and outgroup members could have differential attentional
effects, which could account for the group by mu suppression effects in Gutsell and colleagues’ work. We
have relocated this point to our paragraph on Gutsell and colleagues’ work, for clarity. It was not our
intention to suggest that this work was good evidence that the mu rhythm indexed mu suppression, but
rather to examine whether the use of mu suppression in this experiment could be accounted for by non-
MNS processes.
2.23 At the end of section 3.2.4 the authors state that there may be no need to appeal to a mirror
neuron theory account as alternative accounts could explain the results. It would be informative if the
authors identified what these alternative theories are.
2.23 Reply - These theories were identified throughout the section and are in fact reiterated in the
summary section; specifically, we propose that automatic mimicry and attentional effects could equally
explain studies’ results as well as mirror neuron engagement. We have reiterated these points in our
final sentence for clarity.
2.24 - Section 3.3 – The authors seem to suggest that the presence of alpha suppression in frontal
and/or occipital sites negates the presence of mu suppression. These are not mutually exclusive
phenomena, and I believe it is an over-simplification to use the presence of one as a reason to ignore
the other.
2.24 Reply The reviewer raises a good point that one could indeed get co-occurring occipital suppression
and central suppression during action observation which are functionally distinct. We have noted this in
an earlier section, when discussing the issue of alpha (page 11), rather than in the autism-related
section, as we felt this fit better with the flow of the review. However, considering this issue in Section
3.3 (Mu Suppression studies of autism spectrum disorders), the study we review that best speaks to this
issue is that by Dumas and colleagues. In their whole scalp analyses they performed a source
reconstruction analysis to localise where in the brain the suppression effects were arising from. The
results were that suppression effects were arising from the occipital lobes (see Fig 4 from this paper).
We look forward to hearing your views on our updated manuscript.
