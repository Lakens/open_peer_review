Parenting behaviour is highly heritable in male stickleback
In this manuscript, the authors test for evidence of heritability in male parental care behavior (egg
fanning). Conceptually, this is an interesting topic that is relatively understudied. I do, however,
have some reservations regarding the methods the authors employed to test this idea.
My primary concern is with the quantity of data collected for a test of this nature:
First, the authors clearly point out in the introduction that individual male sticklebacks adjust
their egg fanning rate in response to a wide variety of factors (recent diet, mate behavior and
condition, brood size, age of eggs, and water conditions: temperature, O2 content, algae
conditions). Males also adjust their fanning behavior in response to predator activity (Stein & Bell
2012), competitors (Sargent 1985), and likely the time of day. Despite the known plasticity of this
behavior, the authors’ main result is based on observing the animals one time for a duration of
five minutes. I’m not convinced that this is sufficient. Given the level of plasticity in this behavior,
the stochastic variance associated with these observations will be quite large. This issue could be
somewhat alleviated if the authors had used the repeated measure (a second 5-minute
observation of fanning behavior on egg day 1) that they collected but did not include in their
analysis using the animal model.
Second, if we were to assume that the quantity of data collected from each individual was
sufficient, the number of families, pedigree depth, and total number of individuals included in
the analysis is quite small. Ignoring the fact that the heritability result reported here is incredibly
large, traits closely related to fitness typically have low heritability estimates (Houle 1992) that
require large sample sizes to detect. It is unlikely the present study has the power to detect the
level of heritability one would expect for this trait. More importantly, the small sample size used
in this analysis increases the likelihood that an extremely positive heritability estimate could be
obtained by chance (Palmer 2000).
I also have some concerns regarding the nature of the study and its relevance to animals in the
wild. Fanning behavior is a “dynamic, environmentally responsive behavior” that the authors
measured in a highly controlled lab environment. We know that environmental covariance
between parents and offspring can inflate estimates of additive genetic variation (Sheldon et al.
2003) and this common environment effect can be much greater in magnitude than a genetic
effect (Kruuk & Hadfield 2007). This seems especially relevant to this study given the small
sample size and pedigree depth, and the extremely positive heritability estimate. This certainly
warrants an examination of additional factors that could be incorporated into the animal model,
or at the very least a more thorough discussion of where this very large “heritability” is coming
from and how the observed results compare to wild stickleback.
Other comments:
Line 43 – You are incorrect in claiming that the motivation of the cited studies was for
“understanding parent-offspring coadaptation and indirect genetic effects”. Furthermore, the
relevance of this statement is unclear.
Line 48-49 – Why is studying the inheritance pattern of paternal behavior important (aside from
being the “first” study)?
Line 64-67 – It is unclear why this statement about cognitive requirements is included in the
introduction. I suggest tying it into the introduction better, or perhaps bring this back up in the
discussion for clarity, or remove it.

Line 88-89 – Lacking some potentially important details: How old were the animals? Were any
breeding or in breeding condition? Are they related?
Line 105 – How did you control for variation brood size of parents and F1’s?
Line 130 – Why throw out ED1 data? This could be included in the animal model quite easily.
Line 140-142 – Need a much more detailed explanation of the animal model structure. What is
“all the phenotypic data available”?? Were all measures of fanning at all time points included or
just ED5? Was individual condition (length / weight) included in the model as a covariate? Was
brood size included in the model as a covariate? Really can't assess the model without more
details.
Line 140-142 – Did you include a factor that accounted for the potential for pseudoreplication
created by the fact that all offspring of each father came from the same clutch?
Line 153 – Why not p < 0.0001?
Line 168 – did you mean Table 1?
Line 174 – You need to define Ia and CVa and perhaps explain how they were calculated in the
methods. It would probably be worthwhile to bring these concepts up in the introduction too.
Line 175-176 – It doesn’t appear that there is any need for this sentence.
Line 184 – if you are going to bring up this idea that parenting behavior is “more heritable” in
males, perhaps worth discussing the idea and potential explanations.
Line 188 – While true, perhaps worth explaining why this could push heritability estimates
higher.
Line 217 – the authors really only tested for an effect of body size on fanning, but clearly list a
large number of factors that could affect this behavior in the introduction. First, these factors
should probably be included in the animal model, not tested in a bivariate fashion. Second, why
not include more of these potential confounding factors in the animal model (or at least rule them
out using the model)?
Line 222 – Seems especially relevant to compare fanning behavior observed in the lab to that
expressed in the wild.
Line 237-239 – If heritability is so large for this trait and the effect of fanning on offspring is even
minutely positive, fanning behavior should be massive for all males. First, why is there any
variation left in this trait? This warrants a much more detailed discussion given the results
reported here.
Line 246 – Unclear what this statement really means. do different populations have vastly
different forms of parental care? do different environments require more fanning? Please explain
or remove the statement.

Royal Society Open Science RSOS-171029
This is an interesting, well-written and unique study about the genetic basis of parenting
behaviour in three-spined sticklebacks. Adult male fish were collected in the field and brought
into the lab to mate. These males’ parental care behaviour was studied and then following the
egg care stage the offspring were raised in isolation. Eventually this F1 cohort sexually matured
and then were allowed to breed in the lab and observed. The sons’ and fathers’ fanning
behaviour was correlated and compare This study is really fascinating and valuable because it
marks the first time that inheritance of paternal behaviour has been examined in a system where
dads are the main care providers.
There are few puzzling findings that require some sort of additional explanation. First, why did
sons fan more than their fathers? Is it possible that because of the benign lab conditions and high
quality food in the lab the sons were in better condition or had better immune function or a better
growth trajectory? Were sons more active overall? Did they have higher survival rates? Second,
the authors found unusually high heritability, h2 of 1.85 for fanning behaviour on egg day 5.
Usually h2 values range between 0 and 1. The high heritabilities observed require further
explanation. How can the authors be sure that this is not the result of measurement error? It
would be helpful to know how high the h2 values were on ED1. Why do the authors think the h2
values are so high? Was the h2 lower for the ED1 data?

Line 44-47 – The authors seem to be making the case that this study is inherently interesting
because it focuses the heritability of paternal care. Why would we expect the heritability patterns
of paternal care to be any different from maternal care? If there are not hypotheses that predict
these patterns should be the same or different, the author’s argument “ours is the first to study
paternal care” does not provide a convincing rational. Please explain what unique or valuable
information we can derive from a heritability study that focuses on paternal care system so you
can end the reliance on this “ours is the first”.

this nature. Please re-word line 50, as this species is not a “good” study subject (perhaps re-
emphasize that it is a model species instead?).
Line 257 – Need to address the issue that measuring these behaviors in a common environment
(i.e., a lab setting) can inflate estimates of heritability. We know that environmental covariance
between parents and offspring can inflate estimates of additive genetic variation (Sheldon et al.
2003) and this common environment effect can be much greater in magnitude than a genetic
effect (Kruuk & Hadfield 2007). This is a potential explanation of the results observed here.

Comments to the Author(s)
Line 44-47 – The authors seem to be making the case that this study is inherently interesting
because it focuses the heritability of paternal care. Why would we expect the heritability patterns
of paternal care to be any different from maternal care? If there are not hypotheses that predict
these patterns should be the same or different, the author’s argument “ours is the first to study
paternal care” does not provide a convincing rational. Please explain what unique or valuable
information we can derive from a heritability study that focuses on paternal care system so you
can end the reliance on this “ours is the first”.
Line 74-77 – Please clarify what “in this situation” means.
Line 213-214 – Provide a supplementary figure of these results.
Line 235-236 – This suggests this system might not be the best species to address a question of
this nature. Please re-word line 50, as this species is not a “good” study subject (perhaps re-
emphasize that it is a model species instead?).
Line 257 – Need to address the issue that measuring these behaviors in a common environment
(i.e., a lab setting) can inflate estimates of heritability. We know that environmental covariance
between parents and offspring can inflate estimates of additive genetic variation (Sheldon et al.
2003) and this common environment effect can be much greater in magnitude than a genetic
effect (Kruuk & Hadfield 2007). This is a potential explanation of the results observed here.
Line 258 – Change to “This study provides some evidence for…”
Line 264, 268 – Remove “highly”
Line 275 – explain this potential fitness trade-off a bit more
Line 280 – Remove “high”

ank you for the opportunity to respond to the helpful comments on our
nuscript. Below, we provide a detailed point-by-point response to each of the
mments, indicated by “>>”.
sociate Editor's comments:
have received the reports of two reviewers. The consensus is that this is a
entifically sound study that makes a valuable contribution to the literature.
netheless, both reviewers make tangible suggestions for the improvement of the
nuscript, and especially reviewer 1 raises some questions about the quantity of data
t warrant attention by the authors. Accordingly, I encourage the authors to revise and
ubmit the manuscript.
Thank you for your encouragement and the opportunity to submit a revised

his manuscript, the authors test for evidence of heritability in male parental care
havior (egg fanning). Conceptually, this is an interesting topic that is relatively
derstudied. I do, however, have some reservations regarding the methods the
hors employed to test this idea.
primary concern is with the quantity of data collected for a test of this nature:
st, the authors clearly point out in the introduction that individual male sticklebacks
ust their egg fanning rate in response to a wide variety of factors (recent diet, mate
havior and condition, brood size, age of eggs, and water conditions: temperature, O2
tent, algae conditions). Males also adjust their fanning behavior in response to
dator activity (Stein & Bell 2012), competitors (Sargent 1985), and likely the time of
. Despite the known plasticity of this behavior, the authors’ main result is based on
erving the animals one time for a duration of five minutes. I’m not convinced that this
ufficient. Given the level of plasticity in this behavior, the stochastic variance
ociated with these observations will be quite large. This issue could be somewhat
viated if the authors had used the repeated measure (a second 5-minute
ervation of fanning behavior on egg day 1) that they collected but did not include in
ir analysis using the animal model.
Thank you for pointing out potential problems with our 5-minute measure of
ning behavior. And you’re correct: fanning changes in response to many
tures of the environment and is highly plastic. The reason why we originally
phasized the plasticity of this behavior is to make the point that heritability is
t incompatible with phenotypic plasticity, but we see how this line of reasoning
uld confuse the reader. Therefore, in this version of the paper we toned-down
emphasis on plasticity.
reover, it’s important to note that in our experiment, almost all of these factors
re controlled for. For example, males were fed the same diet, kept under the
me temperature and photoperiod in the lab, measured on the same day of
bryonic development, and maintained in recirculating tanks with filtered water,
nimizing differences in water quality (including O2 levels) across tanks. Also,
les were kept under standardized conditions in the absence of predators and
mpetitors. Therefore it’s unlikely that stochastic variance in this behavior is
ge because virtually none of the factors so far studied that influence fanning
havior would have differed between males on Day 5. This point has been added
ines 160-161. Below, we describe how we now evaluate the influence of some
vironmental effects in the statistical analysis (condition, clutch size and rearing
k).
o, we acknowledge that 5 minutes is a short sample period. Therefore we took
o strategies to formally address the possibility that stochastic variance during
five-minute observation might have influenced our heritability estimate. First,
collected additional data, sampling 5 different males on Day 5 for 5 minutes
o times within a 20 minute period. We then used MCMCglmm to estimate
eatability of fanning time. The repeatability estimate was very high: 0.93 with a
% credible interval of 0.51-0.99. This result strongly suggests that males
intain their rank order differences in fanning over the course of day 5, and that
ning does not change dramatically within males on day 5.
cond, we recorded the parenting behavior of one male for one hour on Day 5.
then subsampled this at 5 minute intervals for a total of 11 5-minute sessions
d determined the percent time fanning occurred. The actual proportion of time
ent fanning in the one hour period was 41.55%. The average deviation of the 11
inute sessions was 0.19% with a sd of 4.61%. We used data to simulate
viations that may occur due to sampling error and added these deviations to
ch data point, under the condition that fanning was not allowed to be less than
r greater than 300 seconds. We then recalculated the heritability estimate from
animal model. This was then repeated 1,000 times to give a range of
itability estimates expected if the deviations were as large as those observed
he 11 five-minute sessions. The heritability estimates ranged from 0.17 to 0.98,
d are strongly left-skewed (95% of the estimates are > 0.61), suggesting our
ults are robust to stochastic variation from sampling error. These results have
w been added to the manuscript on lines 207-215.
appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to incorporate all the data at hand, i.e.,
nclude data on fanning on ED1. However, most (12/13 fathers, 22/26 sons)
les did not fan on ED1 (offspring family average = 5.88 seconds out of a 300
cond observation period, also see Figure 1), therefore it is not a true “repeated
asure” and we elected not to include it in the final analysis. This detail has
en added to the manuscript on line 137.
cond, if we were to assume that the quantity of data collected from each individual
s sufficient, the number of families, pedigree depth, and total number of individuals
luded in the analysis is quite small. Ignoring the fact that the heritability result
orted here is incredibly large, traits closely related to fitness typically have low
itability estimates (Houle 1992) that require large sample sizes to detect. It is unlikely
present study has the power to detect the level of heritability one would expect for
trait. More importantly, the small sample size used in this analysis increases the
lihood that an extremely positive heritability estimate could be obtained by chance
lmer 2000).
We agree that the sample size is small, and that the heritability estimate is
prisingly large. We now mention that small sample sizes increase the
elihood of a high estimate by chance alone, and cite the Palmer 2000 paper on
e 234. We also discuss possible explanations for the high heritability of a
ess-related trait on lines 232--257.
s also worth considering that these data are extremely hard to collect (now
ntioned on line 234-236) and valuable. For example, generation time in
cklebacks is one year, and convincing sticklebacks to nest, breed and care for
ir offspring in the lab is challenging. Collecting data on one individual father,
example, can take more than one month. Given the importance of sticklebacks
a model organism in both evolutionary biology and the study of animal
havior, we think this paper represents an important contribution that will
pefully inspire other labs to replicate our findings and to estimate heritability in
er populations.
so have some concerns regarding the nature of the study and its relevance to
mals in the wild. Fanning behavior is a “dynamic, environmentally responsive
havior” that the authors measured in a highly controlled lab environment. We know
t environmental covariance between parents and offspring can inflate estimates of
ditive genetic variation (Sheldon et al. 2003) and this common environment effect can
much greater in magnitude than a genetic effect (Kruuk & Hadfield 2007). This
ms especially relevant to this study given the small sample size and pedigree depth,
d the extremely positive heritability estimate. This certainly warrants an examination
additional factors that could be incorporated into the animal model, or at the very
st a more thorough discussion of where this very large “heritability” is coming from
d how the observed results compare to wild stickleback.
Thank you for these suggestions. It seems unlikely that environmental
iance might have inflated the heritability estimate because the highly
ntrolled lab environment should have reduced the environmental covariance
ween offspring and fathers by reducing the total environmental variance and
o by reducing the opportunity for microhabitat selection and other factors that
ate environmental covariance in the wild. But we do agree that it’s worth
nsidering additional factors that could be incorporated into the animal model,
refore we ran a new model for Day 5 fanning with male condition (mass/length)
d clutch size as covariates. We also include the “patch” in which an individual
s raised to control for common environmental variation (we assumed each
d-caught father was independent and gave each father a unique “patch”
mber).
e model which corrected for these additional effects produced a high
itability estimate (0.90) with a large 95% credible interval (0.36-1.00) that does
t include 0. Neither covariate was a significant predictor of fanning (condition:
CMC = 0.55, clutch size: pMCMC = 0.62). Moreover, the variance accounted for
patch was very small (2.35% of variance explained with a CI of 1.33%-3.49%).
ese results have been added to lines 201-206. We’ve also expanded the
cussion of potential explanations for the high heritability estimate and its
evance to sticklebacks in natural populations on lines 231—257, 264-279.
er comments:
e 43 – You are incorrect in claiming that the motivation of the cited studies was for
derstanding parent-offspring coadaptation and indirect genetic effects”. Furthermore,
relevance of this statement is unclear.
Corrected.
e 48-49 – Why is studying the inheritance pattern of paternal behavior important
ide from being the “first” study)?
We clarify that quantifying the inheritance of paternal behavior in systems
ere fathers are the only caregivers is important because it provides an
portunity to ask about genetic variation underlying a trait when selection is
y acting on fathers, rather than both parents.
e 64-67 – It is unclear why this statement about cognitive requirements is included in
introduction. I suggest tying it into the introduction better, or perhaps bring this back
in the discussion for clarity, or remove it.
We removed this point about cognitive requirements.
e 88-89 – Lacking some potentially important details: How old were the animals?
re any breeding or in breeding condition? Are they related?
The animals were all adults in breeding condition. As the animals were
lected from the wild their relatedness is unknown. These details have been
ded to lines 86-87.
e 105 – How did you control for variation brood size of parents and F1’s?
See comment above. We now report heritability estimates after controlling for
tch size.
e 130 – Why throw out ED1 data? This could be included in the animal model quite
ily.
Please see our more detailed comments above. We did not consider the ED1
a because very few individuals fanned on the first day.
e 140-142 – Need a much more detailed explanation of the animal model structure.
at is “all the phenotypic data available”?? Were all measures of fanning at all time
nts included or just ED5? Was individual condition (length / weight) included in the
del as a covariate? Was brood size included in the model as a covariate? Really
't assess the model without more details.
Corrected, see lines 136-139, 161-167.
e 140-142 – Did you include a factor that accounted for the potential for
udoreplication created by the fact that all offspring of each father came from the
me clutch?
We include such a factor now.
e 153 – Why not p < 0.0001?
We elected to show the estimated p-value rather than rounding in order to
ilitate future meta-analyses.
e 168 – did you mean Table 1?
Yes. Corrected
e 174 – You need to define Ia and CVa and perhaps explain how they were
culated in the methods. It would probably be worthwhile to bring these concepts up in
introduction too.
Corrected. IA = VA / mean2 = (CVA / 100)2; CVA = 100 * (sqrt(VA) / mean). We
rify that these statistics are used to estimate evolvability, and discuss their
portance at the end of the Introduction.
e 175-176 – It doesn’t appear that there is any need for this sentence.
Corrected. We now clarify why evolvabilities are relevant to this study.
e 184 – if you are going to bring up this idea that parenting behavior is “more
itable” in males, perhaps worth discussing the idea and potential explanations.
We removed this discussion because we agree that its relevance is not clear.
e 188 – While true, perhaps worth explaining why this could push heritability
imates higher.
Corrected, see lines 108-117, 244-257.
e 217 – the authors really only tested for an effect of body size on fanning, but clearly
a large number of factors that could affect this behavior in the introduction. First,
se factors should probably be included in the animal model, not tested in a bivariate
hion. Second, why not include more of these potential confounding factors in the
mal model (or at least rule them out using the model)?
Most of the factors that influence fanning that were mentioned in the
roduction were controlled for experimentally. We now add condition and clutch
e as fixed covariates and patch as an additional random factor to the animal
del (see above).
e 222 – Seems especially relevant to compare fanning behavior observed in the lab
hat expressed in the wild.
We agree and mention a study which measured fanning in the field (Stein and
ll 2014)
e 237-239 – If heritability is so large for this trait and the effect of fanning on offspring
ven minutely positive, fanning behavior should be massive for all males. First, why is
re any variation left in this trait? This warrants a much more detailed discussion
en the results reported here.
We agree and speculate about factors maintaining the variation in fanning on
es 273-279.
e 246 – Unclear what this statement really means. Do different populations have
tly different forms of parental care? do different environments require more fanning?
ase explain or remove the statement.
Clarified.
ure 2 – Are there any outliers here? what happens to the relationship when you
ove Family #8?
None of the points in Figure 2 are outliers according to the 1.5 * IQR rule. The
iduals of the regression are normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilks: W = 0.95136,
alue = 0.6191), further supporting the lack of outliers.

s is an interesting, well-written and unique study about the genetic basis of parenting
haviour in three-spined sticklebacks. Adult male fish were collected in the field and
ught into the lab to mate. These males’ parental care behaviour was studied and
n following the egg care stage the offspring were raised in isolation. Eventually this
cohort sexually matured and then were allowed to breed in the lab and
erved. The sons’ and fathers’ fanning behaviour was correlated and compared. This
dy is really fascinating and valuable because it marks the first time that inheritance of
ernal behaviour has been examined in a system where dads are the main care
viders.
Thank you for the positive feedback!
ere are few puzzling findings that require some sort of additional explanation.
st, why did sons fan more than their fathers? Is it possible that because of the benign
conditions and high quality food in the lab the sons were in better condition or had
ter immune function or a better growth trajectory? Were sons more active
rall? Did they have higher survival rates?
Although the difference between sons and fathers was not statistically
nificant, we agree that the trend is interesting. We can only speculate but
ssible reasons include the fact that sons were measured slightly differently
m their fathers (described on lines 124-126), which might have led them to fan
re, and that they were reared in the lab rather than wild caught. It seems
ikely that differences in condition were responsible for the difference between
behavior of fathers and sons because condition was not related to fanning.
fortunately, we do not have any measures of activity independent of fanning.
cause the difference in fanning was not statistically significant we did not
lude these speculations in the manuscript. Also, because the animal model
culates heritability using a variance component approach, this difference does
t influence the estimate.
cond, the authors found unusually high heritability, h2 of 1.85 for fanning behaviour
egg day 5. Usually h2 values range between 0 and 1. The high heritabilities
erved require further explanation. How can the authors be sure that this is not the
ult of measurement error? It would be helpful to know how high the h2 values were
ED1. Why do the authors think the h2 values are so high? Was the h2 lower for the
1 data?
While it’s true that heritability can’t be greater than 1, estimates of heritability
sed on parent-offspring regressions can be greater than 1. When only one
ent’s trait values are known, as in our case, the slope of the parent-offspring
ression must be multiplied by 2 because theoretically each parent determines
% of the genetic variation in their offspring’s trait. Therefore, when the slope of
regression between offspring and one parent is greater than 0.5, the
itability estimate will be greater than 1. This could be caused by a few different
sons. For example, if the offspring tend to have higher values than the parent
e see a trend of this in our data, but again it is nonsignificant, and we get
ilar results in the parent-offspring regression even with standardized data).
o, fathers will determine more than 50% of the variation to fanning if fanning is
ex-linked trait. Finally, paternal effects could cause an inflated heritability
imate by increasing the covariance between fathers and sons.
think it’s unlikely that measurement error contributed to the high heritability
imate because fanning behavior is extremely simple to code, has a clear
ginning and end and we are very experienced with recording it.
cause the estimate was so high and this result can be confusing, we elected to
it the heritability estimate based on parent-offspring regression and instead
us on the animal model results, including a new animal model that controls for
ndition, clutch size and rearing environment. But we certainly take the
iewer’s point that the high estimate – even from the animal model – is
expected, and we now elaborate more in the discussion about some reasons
these high heritability estimates.
are reluctant to include the heritability of fanning on ED1 in this paper
cause it occurred at such a low rate (see above). In this case a regression is
ppropriate because of the large proportion of individuals who did not fan on
t day (see Figure 1 for the sons fanning), which is not unusual.
or Comments
3. Not clear if the tremendous phenotypic diversity within and across populations has
thing to do with parenting. Please clarify. If not, it is not immediately clear why
se fish would make good models for this question.
We now clarify that there is considerable repeatable variation in parental
havior within populations of stickleback (line 66-67).
9. What are these conspicuous parenting behaviours?
Corrected; males fan and tend their nest, see line 58-60.
2. Define narrow sense heritability
Corrected, see line 75-76. Va / Vp, additive genetic variation divided by total
enotypic variation.
8. How many adults were collected? And how many of these built nests? Were all of
se used in this experiment? How were the 13 particular male fathers selected for
experiment? Why only 13?
Hundreds of animals of both sexes were collected, but only those males
owing signs of reproductive maturity (red throat, territorial behavior) were put
o individual tanks and used in this experiment. One males have been identified,
our experience approximately 60% of those males eventually complete the
ire breeding cycle (build nests, successfully mate, rear offspring through
persal). The 13 particular male fathers were used because they ultimately
mpleted the entire experiment and produced sons that also completed the
periment. These details have been added to lines 129-131.
10. The importance of this sentence is not clear. Please elaborate or connect the
s better for your readers.
We clarify that it is possible that the way that parents care for their offspring
ght influence offspring behavioral development, thereby introducing
vironmental, nongenetic effects of parents on offspring that could increase the
emblance between parents and offspring (line 108-117)
07. Please explain why the wild caught males were not observed at the fry care
ge? Alternatively it would be equally interesting to understand why the F1
havioural observations carried on into the days after hatching?
We now clarify that eggs were removed right before hatching in order to
ntrol for the possibility of nongenetic paternal effects (line 108-117), and we
spected that such effects might be particularly strong after hatching. The
enting behavior of the F1s continued to be observed after hatching because
were not concerned about nongenetic environmental effects on the F2.
20. Please explain why the parenting behaviour of the F1 males was measured in a
ger nesting tanks and via a mirror over the tanks?
We began to suspect that one reason why males might not complete the
periment (contributing to our small sample size) is because they were
turbed by us while we were watching them care for their offspring; perhaps
les abandoned their nest because of the threat they perceived from us.
erefore we decided to try to increase our success rate by minimizing disruption
ring the behavior observations. We put the sons in bigger tanks and watched
m from above with a mirror (rather than from the side) in order to minimize our
uence. This is now explained on lines 124-126.
64. Please explain what is meant by environmental paternal effects.
Corrected, see lines 108-117, 244-257.
74. Define IA and CVA
Corrected, see line 188-189. IA = VA / mean2 = (CVA / 100)2; CVA = 100 *
rt(VA) / mean)
80. In three-spined stickleback
Corrected.
84. Please explain why the heritability of parental care in males is higher than in
ales?
This sentence was removed; reviewer 1 also pointed out that its relevance was
t clear.
86. Provisioning too will change over time.
Good point; this section was rephrased.
91. Can you give any other examples of a trait with high heritabilities that arise
ause the trait was not under selection?
Not really, but theory supposes that directional selection removes genetic
iation and hence decreases heritability. Therefore theory predicts that traits
der weak selection are likely to have high heritability. This is now explained
re on lines 236-243.
34. Is there any across population correlations for male fanning rates and female
ferences for rapid fanning?
Not that we are aware of, but there is evidence that female stickleback prefer to
te with males that fan at higher rates (Candolin 1997), therefore parenting
havior might be sexually selected within populations.

mments to the Author(s)
e 44-47 – The authors seem to be making the case that this study is inherently
resting because it focuses the heritability of paternal care. Why would we expect the
itability patterns of paternal care to be any different from maternal care? If there are
hypotheses that predict these patterns should be the same or different, the author’s
ument “ours is the first to study paternal care” does not provide a convincing rational.
ase explain what unique or valuable information we can derive from a heritability
dy that focuses on paternal care system so you can end the reliance on this “ours is
first”.
Rephrased. We were not trying to argue that we are interested in comparing the
netic architecture of mothering and fathering, which is not possible in this system,
ere only fathers provide care. Instead, knowing about the genetic architecture of
enting in uniparental species such as sticklebacks is important because it might
er from the genetic architecture of parenting in biparental species, where selection is
uably more constrained because parental care is expressed in both sexes.
e 74-77 – Please clarify what “in this situation” means.
emoved “in this situation”
e 213-214 – Provide a supplementary figure of these results.
added
e 235-236 – This suggests this system might not be the best species to address a
estion of this nature. Please re-word line 50, as this species is not a “good” study
ject (perhaps re-emphasize that it is a model species instead?).
corrected
e 257 – Need to address the issue that measuring these behaviors in a common
ironment (i.e., a lab setting) can inflate estimates of heritability. We know that
ironmental covariance between parents and offspring can inflate estimates of
ditive genetic variation (Sheldon et al. 2003) and this common environment effect can
much greater in magnitude than a genetic effect (Kruuk & Hadfield 2007). This is a
ential explanation of the results observed here.
This detail was added, but we also note that environmental variance was minimized
his lab study. Environmental conditions were standardized across tanks. Shared
