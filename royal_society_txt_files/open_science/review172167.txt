Gang members are thought to represent a population at very high risk for several chronic liver
diseases, because of their multiple risk factors for HCV infection (chronic hepatitis C acquired
from past or current injecting drug use (IDU) or through tattooing in prisons; chronic hepatitis B
acquired through early horizontal or vertical transmission in NZ Maori; alcoholic liver disease
through from past or current heavy alcohol intake; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease secondary to
obesity in NZ Maori and Pacific Islanders). In this paper, Aluzaite et al determine the prevalence
of chronic liver disease through blood tests and Fibroscan liver stiffness measurements. They also
determine the prevalence of risk factors for each of the chronic liver diseases.
This is an interesting study, but several issues need to be addressed before this manuscript van be
accepted for publication.
This is a very small study and includes only 18 study subjects were gang members. The Authors
should explain why they included family members and affiliates in this small study – this is
perfectly reasonable as family members will share many of the risk factors for chronic liver
disease (ethnicity, life style factors of IDU, high incarceration rate and heavy alcohol use). But the
title should reflect who the study population was – please change title to “A liver health hui -
Hepatitis C knowledge and associated risk factors in New Zealand gang members and their
families”.
The introduction states that 75% people with CHB and CHC remain undiagnosed in 2017. This
low diagnosis rate may be a global figure skewed by extremely low testing in low income
countries. HCV testing has increased dramatically in high income countries over the past decade,
such that the undiagnosed rates are estimated between 50% (USA, NZ, UK) to <20% (Australia,
France, Germany)). Please correct.
Please define what “gang affiliate” means.
The low rate of HCV seropositivity in the study population is surprising and may reflect different
factors, each of which should be addressed in the Discussion section of the manuscript.
1. By chance because of the small sample size: Estimated anti-HCV prevalence is 1.1% in NZ
population and 1.5% in adults for total of 50,000. In a sample size of 52, then <1 would be
expected to be positive.
2. Low-risk population: But the data provided shows a relatively high history of IDU (7/7%)
3. Insensitive assay: what are the details of the antibody test used? I am concerned by the
disparity between this result and the high rate of abnormal liver function tests and increased liver
stiffness measurements. Although other co-factors may be responsible (alcohol, obesity) I think it
is important to verify these results by performing HCV RNA testing on all 52 subjects.
The low rate of HbsAg seropositivity in the study population is also surprising but is likely to be
explained by region of birth (low in South Island Maori) and relatively young age of this gang
population – most would have received neonatal vaccination. Can the Authors add this missing
data?
More information is needed in the Results section entitled “Liver Health”. In the Methods section,
the Authors state the cut-offs for liver stiffness measurements (LSM) which define nil (F0),
minimal (F1), significant (F2) and severe fibrosis (F3) and cirrhosis (F4). However, LSM cut-offs
for each stage is disease specific – lowest in patients with chronic hepatitis B, intermediate with
chronic hepatitis C and highest with NAFLD. The cut-offs adopted appear to be between HBV
and HCV but this would not seem appropriate to use across the entire study cohort, especially as
the most common chronic liver disease is likely to be NAFLD and therefore these figures are
likely to overestimate the severity of sever fibrosis/cirrhosis.
3
Given the high prevalence of obesity in this population, and the fact that obesity is associated
with high Fibroscan failure PLUS artifactually increased LSM measurements, the Authors should
provide a table which includes the following additional information: (i) Median LSM according
to BMI group (<25kg/m2; 25-30; 30-35; >35); Fibroscan failure rates according to BMI group
(<25kg/m2; 25-30; 30-35; >35).
70% of the study cohort were obese and it is likely most had metabolic syndrome - what was the
rate of hypertension, Type II diabetes, hyperlipidaemia?
Do the Authors think that the very low rate of HBV and HCV found in this gang population is
representative of the total gang population across New Zealand given the higher HBV rates
found in North Island?
There are no cut-offs validated for individuals with no documented aetiology.

I am happy that all the queries raised by myself and other reviewers have been answered in this
revised manuscript. Accepting the limitations of prevalence data from such a small study sample,
this is an important study as it describes a successful method of recruiting individuals from a
very marginalised population into a community health programme. Lessons from this study
could be incorporated into future HBV and HCV testing programmes.

Prof Kevin Padian
Royal Society Open Science
Dear Prof Kevin Padian,
Re Decision on Manuscript ID RSOS-172167:
Thank you for facilitating the review of our manuscript titled “A liver health hui - Hepatitis C
knowledge and associated risk factors in a New Zealand gang population”. Please find below
our responses to the comments.
We agree with the reviewer 1 on the importance of this manuscript due to the multiple risk
factors associated with the population of interest. We thank the reviewer for the comments
and suggestions, however, some of the information requested is not available due to the type
and scope of the study.
1) This is a very small study and includes only 18 study subjects were gang members. The
Authors should explain why they included family members and affiliates in this small study –
this is perfectly reasonable as family members will share many of the risk factors for chronic
liver disease (ethnicity, life style factors of IDU, high incarceration rate and heavy alcohol
use). But the title should reflect who the study population was – please change title to “A
liver health hui - Hepatitis C knowledge and associated risk factors in New Zealand gang
members and their families”.
We agree with the comment and changed the title as suggested. We also included the
justification for including the family members in the Methods section Study design and
participants (lines:111-113).
2) The introduction states that 75% people with CHB and CHC remain undiagnosed in 2017.
This low diagnosis rate may be a global figure skewed by extremely low testing in low income
countries. HCV testing has increased dramatically in high income countries over the past
decade, such that the undiagnosed rates are estimated between 50% (USA, NZ, UK) to <20%
(Australia, France, Germany)). Please correct.

We thank for this information, and clarified the statement to include the range “20-75%” (line
60) and added 2 additional references with recent estimates in France and New Zealand.
3) Please define what “gang affiliate” means.
We included an explanatory footnote next to line 112: “Gang affiliate is defined as someone
associated with the gang, but not yet accepted as an official gang member and not a
biological family member”.
4) The low rate of HCV seropositivity in the study population is surprising and may reflect
different factors, each of which should be addressed in the Discussion section of the
manuscript.
1. By chance because of the small sample size: Estimated anti-HCV prevalence is 1.1% in NZ
population and 1.5% in adults for total of 50,000. In a sample size of 52, then <1 would be
expected to be positive.
2. Low-risk population: But the data provided shows a relatively high history of IDU (7/7%)
3. Insensitive assay: what are the details of the antibody test used? I am concerned by the
disparity between this result and the high rate of abnormal liver function tests and increased
liver stiffness measurements. Although other co-factors may be responsible (alcohol, obesity)
I think it is important to verify these results by performing HCV RNA testing on all 52
subjects.
These points were further clarified in the discussion section (lines 250-253).
The type of assay used for HCV antibody detection was Roche Cobas Anti-HCV II with
100% sensitivity (95% lower confidence limit 99.61%) and 99.66% specificity (lower
confidence limit (2-sided) - 99.41-99.82%). The assays used for HBV surface antigen and
HBV surface and core antibody detection, were Roche Cobas HBsAH II quant II and Roche
Cobas Anti-HBs, respectively. These assays were done in the Southern Community
Laboratories (diagnostic laboratory services) (lines 126-127). Given the high sensitivity/
specificity rates and the professional service, we expect these results to be accurate. The
names of each of the assays used in this study were added to the Methods section (lines 127-
131).
Unfortunately, we cannot verify the results by performing HCV RNA testing, as the study
was based on an anonymous survey (as approved by the University of Otago Human Ethics
Committee), which was explicitly
stated in the participant information and consent sheets and the questionnaire. Permission to
contact the participants again was only granted in case of positive disease test results.
Anonymous participation in the study was one of the key points of agreement with this high
risk population.
5) The low rate of HbsAg seropositivity in the study population is also surprising but is likely
to be explained by region of birth (low in South Island Maori) and relatively young age of
this gang population – most would have received neonatal vaccination. Can the Authors add
this missing data?
We do not have information about the exact vaccination status of the study participants
(outside the scope of the study), but included a question on their vaccination status in the
questionnaire and were able to infer HBV immunity from the HBV serologic test results. This
2
information was linked with the participants’ eligibility for vaccination based on their age in
lines 196-202 and lines 284-286.
Majority (n=39/52) of the study participants were surveyed in the North Island (Wellington
and Taupo), and none of the participants’ location of birth is known, hence, unfortunately, we
cannot explain the low rate of HbsAg seropositivity by region of birth. We thank the reviewer
for this insight.
6) More information is needed in the Results section entitled “Liver Health”. In the Methods
section, the Authors state the cut-offs for liver stiffness measurements (LSM) which define nil
(F0), minimal (F1), significant (F2) and severe fibrosis (F3) and cirrhosis (F4). However,
LSM cut-offs for each stage is disease specific – lowest in patients with chronic hepatitis B,
intermediate with chronic hepatitis C and highest with NAFLD. The cut-offs adopted appear
to be between HBV and HCV but this would not seem appropriate to use across the entire
study cohort, especially as the most common chronic liver disease is likely to be NAFLD and
therefore these figures are likely to overestimate the severity of sever fibrosis/cirrhosis.
Given the high prevalence of obesity in this population, and the fact that obesity is associated
with high Fibroscan failure PLUS artifactually increased LSM measurements, the Authors
should provide a table which includes the following additional information: (i) Median LSM
according to BMI group (<25kg/m2; 25-30; 30-35; >35); Fibroscan failure rates according
to BMI group (<25kg/m2; 25-30; 30-35; >35).
70% of the study cohort were obese and it is likely most had metabolic syndrome - what was
the rate of hypertension, Type II diabetes, hyperlipidaemia?
Thank you for this point, we included lines 174-178 and the suggested table showing median
liver stiffness values within BMI categories to better communicate Fibroscan results (Table 1
in Appendix). These data were only available for the Turangi population (n=20). There were
no Fibroscan failures in this group.
Table 1: Fibroscan Liver stiffness estimates in the BMI groups (Turangi population, n=20)
BMI group (kg/m2) Median (IQR) liver stiffness, kPa
Normal (<25) (n=1) 4.3 (NA)
Overweight (25-29.9) (n=5) 4.7 (4.4-4.8)
Obesity class I (30-34.9) (n=8) 4.5 (4.0-5.9)
Obesity class II and III (=35) (n=6) 4.4 (4.1-11.2)
We cannot account for the BMI in fibrosis categories for all the study participants, as these
data were not collected. Unfortunately, we also do not have information on the rates of
hypertension, Type II diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, as this information was outside the scope of
this study. However, we do agree that this information would have added further insight into
liver and overall health of the study population.
7) Do the Authors think that the very low rate of HBV and HCV found in this gang population
is representative of the total gang population across New Zealand given the higher HBV
rates found in North Island? There are no cut-offs validated for individuals with no
documented aetiology.
As we discussed in the discussions section (lines 252-256), we suspect we underestimated the
rates of HBV and HCV due to the self-selecting nature of the study. However, despite not
3
being able to capture a fully representative gang population sample, these data provide
valuable insights into the liver and overall health of the population and a step towards
deciphering the associated challenges.
We hope we addressed each point in sufficient detail, making the manuscript suitable for
publication with the Royal Society Open Science journal. Please let us know if any further
clarifications are required.
Kind regards,
Kristina Aluzaite
