Overweight dogs are pessimistic – the behavior of canine subjects shows similarity with
personality traits of overweight humans
This is a nicely done study examining the effect of breed and obesity on two cognitive tasks in
domestic dogs; the two-way object choice test and a cognitive bias task. The manuscript is overall
well-written, there is a moderate sample size, and an interesting finding in regard to the
performance of overweight dogs. I have several minor comments and questions, as detailed
below. I also think the manuscript is rather long and can be tightened up in a few places (5 page
intro/for example, much of pages 6 and 7 is just a “preview” of what will be repeated in the
methods – 7 pages of methods, can they be made more concise with a diagram or other? – 4 pages
of discussion). The paper is suitable for publication in RSOS.
Specific comments and questions
Title: In lines 424-426, the authors suggest that personality may be a better explanation than
pessimism for obesity. The title of the paper makes it unclear whether the authors consider
pessimism to be a personality trait or if they are referring to other results such as impulsivity.
Anyway, it might be helpful to provide a clearer title that explains the results such as
“Overweight dogs less likely to attend to ambiguous stimuli” etc.
The term ambivalent is used throughout the text to describe the ambiguous choice. Ambivalent
means having conflicting feelings; the word ambiguous would be a better descriptor of the task.
Lines 51-53 – I’m not convinced that dogs and humans share the same environment – do you
have a citation? After all, for pet dogs, their environment is highly dictated by the human
(including availability of food and exercise/mental stimulation, all of which highly likely
contribute to obesity in dogs)– who is free to leave the dog’s environment at any time. Frank
McMillan’s review of stress-induced overeating in companion animals may be of interest:
McMillan, F. D. (2013). Stress-induced and emotional eating in animals: a review of the
experimental evidence and implications for companion animal obesity. Journal of Veterinary
Behavior: Clinical Applications and Research, 8(5), 376-385.
Lines 64-65 – it might be good to provide the reader with a general definition of cognitive bias
task, as here you are referring to a different paradigm as a cognitive bias task, it is not necessarily
clear at this point if this is similar to the test you will do with dogs.
Materials and Methods
Line 151 – citation that some dog breeds are more prone to obesity than others
Lines 164-165 – how does being over a year of age ensure accepting food in a novel location?
Line 167 – who assessed the dogs, was there inter-rater reliability? Were dog scores collapsed into
two categories (overweight and not) because I don’t see three weight groups in the data analysis.
Lines 175-176 – please give the percent of each group that was overweight for easy comparison
Line 184 – how many raters coded the video? What was the inter-rater reliability
Lines 221-222 – in the alternative reward trial, were both rewards placed in the bowl in a similar
manner (this only refers to the empty alternative)
Lines 227-229 A diagram of the experimental paradigm (including placement of bowls, where
dog and experimenter were) would be helpful
Lines 239-240 – It should be clarified that this is to avoid allowing the dog to examine both bowls
Line 240 – did the dogs always eat the less desirable reward? Was it determined ahead of time
that the dogs would actually eat the low incentive food? Otherwise, this could have affected your
results on the two reward choice task
3
Statistical analyses
Were any posthoc/pairwise comparisons done? Was alpha adjusted for multiple comparisons
between breeds? Specifically, for lines 357-359 and 381-382, the effects might be nominal once
alpha is adjusted.
Lines 357-359 – why are only comparisons with Retrievers included?
At some points in the manuscript, the total number of dogs is 90 (see Lines 160-161 and Figure 2)
but the N is referred to as 91 throughout. Please clarify the number of dogs (both total and of each
breed) used in the study and analysis and if any dogs were omitted from analyses.
Was a power analysis (posthoc or otherwise) performed?
Results
Line 328: again, please clarify the number of dogs in the study
Rather than just say 66 dogs completed all 20 trials, can you also provide the range of trials
performed among subjects? Were any dogs omitted for not performing a minimum number of
trials?
Lines 352-353 – this would be clearer if rephrased to “overweight dogs were less likely to choose
the indicated bowl”, there are several similar grammatical errors in lines 386-398.
Discussion
In general, the discussion could be more concise and focus on the two most interesting and
convincing results: overweight dogs were less likely to follow the human point when a more
desirable treat was in the other container, and that they were more likely to drop out of the
ambivalent test trials.
Lines 395-398 – be clear which task you are referring to when summarizing results – you switch
from one to the other without explaining for the reader
Discussion, general question: were there any differences in training history between the subjects?
Could that not be an explanation for some of the differences between individuals or even breeds?
Figures
Figure captions could be improved by briefly summarizing the results/importance of the finding.
Figure 1 is not helpful without knowing how many trials on average the dogs who did not
complete the task completed.
Figure 2 – the figure legend needs to be fixed; both graphs are not proportion, one is number, one
if proportion. Number is not informative if we don’t know the total number of trials completed
by dogs who did not complete all 20 trials. Again, clarify the number of dogs, the breed numbers
add up to 90.
Figure 3 – 5 – please explain both axes of the graphs and what they mean. Figure 4 is the most
interesting/compelling. Figure 5 does not suggest many differences and can be omitted.

label_comment_2
From what I can discern, the study described in the manuscript tested whether there were
differences between overweight and other dogs in how they responded in a cognitive bias test.
According to the title of the manuscript and text therein, they found that overweight dogs made
'pessimistic' decisions.
This is a highly interesting topic and I have no reason, based on my reading of the manuscript,
that there were any problems with the design and methods used. It's also a relevant paper as it
may help to highlight common mechanisms and relationships between obesity and cognition
across taxa.
Unfortunately for me, try as I did, I was unable to follow large, crucial portions of the
manuscript. The writing was just not clear and there were problems with how the paper was
organized, too. As such, I had a difficult time working out what was done procedurally,
statistically, and what the results were. I did not see how the different analyses were connected to
hypotheses or a hypothesis, and, if the latter, whether steps had been taken to reduce the
likelihood of type 1 errors.
As such, and this is the first time I've encountered this situation in my 15 years of reviewing,
although I would like to be able to render a decision about this paper, I cannot do so in good
faith. I realize that English is not the authors' first language, and I am really sympathetic, and
have made an effort to get the information, but I simply am not able to.
Given the nature of the problem investigated, and the fact that it would be of interest to a very
broad audience, and the fact that the authors have collected a lot of data and have very likely
analyzed it correctly, I would recommend that the authors seek out a native-English speaker who
works in the same field, and to ask them to carefully proofread a draft and to help them get it into
a state that would enable me to review the paper fully.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
Both Reviewers find the work interesting. One Reviewer suggests minor revisions - and these are
given in some detail.
Reviewer 2 found difficulty in following exactly what had been done and suggests the
recruitment of a native English speaker.
Although the Reviewers' opinions seem divided, my guess is that careful revision targeted at
enhancing the clarity of the manuscript will make this manuscript ready for publication.
The categories of minor and major revision are slightly 'n the eye of the beholder'. I have
indicated a major revision, but I hope this will not be off-putting. The work will be of great
interest to readers and I hope you will choose to revise and resubmit this manuscript to RSOS.

Subject Editor Comments to the Author:
I urge the authors to take very seriously the comments of the second reviewer who felt forced to
recommend a rejection on the grounds of not being able to understand the results. The English
itself is not terrible in this paper, but it can use improvement. More importantly, as the reviewer
says, the introduction and methods sections are very long and really should be more concise. I
found it very difficult to follow the Discussion and it is here that the English needs most work,
but also it is not clear what the authors are finding. Please be more concise. There seems to be
considerable speculation that should clearly be separated from the findings.
I recommend a "reject, resubmit" decision because our "revision" timeframe is perhaps too short
to address the issues raised and rewrite the manuscript; however these issues will all need to be
addressed before further review is possible. Thanks for submitting this interesting study. I
learned a lot about my labrador receivers!

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The authors of this paper examine the behaviour (food related cognitive responses) of obese and
normal-weight dogs. I think this is a really important and interesting topic. As research using this
approach is practically non-existent, I believe this paper is very valuable not only because of the
data presented, but also to promote this research line. However, as currently written, I’m afraid
that the manuscript is not suitable for publication. (I do not have access to the original
submission, and judging from the authors’ response to the first round of reviewer comments they
already did some improvements, but I still do not think that the paper is of sufficient quality.)
There are two main issues, the first of which could be addressed in a resubmission. The paper in
its current form is very hard to read. It is not only that the paper is very long (compared to the
usual royal society format), but the sentences are unnecessarily complicated and it often needs
several re-readings to understand. Also for example the Introduction doesn’t seem to follow a
steady logic. (I understand that due to the very nature of the research topic there are quite few
studies that are directly relevant, but it is still a problem that vaguely related literature is just put
next to each other without providing a coherent frame.) I think the paper would highly benefit
from a thorough re-writing so that it is much more concise. And the main issue is not (only) that
the text needs shortening, but they probably need to replace some references to make their point.
My other problem is with how the tests were done, namely subject selection. I think it is rather
unfortunate that the authors mixed two questions (obese individuals and obesity-prone breeds)
into one study. As currently done this highly compromises the results. Their sample had N=16
obese dogs, 14 of which are from two of the four breeds they studied. It is natural that by random
sampling, the authors would get more obese dogs in the obesity-prone breeds, but this way they
cannot disentangle the two factors. Even more troubling is that since they only used four breeds
total (two obesity-prone and two non-obesity-prone) it cannot be excluded that other breed
differences might cause any differences they find. The authors discuss one such breed difference,
and they do argue that selection for cooperative versus non-cooperative work has an effect, but
many other factors might be at play, and these are impossible to control for with so few breeds in
the sample. Just to mention one, both non-obese breeds (Border Collie, Mudi) are herding dogs,
while the obesity-prone breeds are hounds (Beagle) and Gundogs (Retrievers). It is also
problematic that the number of obese dogs (N=16) is very low compared to the N=75 normal
weight dogs. Since obesity is the main factor that the authors test, it would be highly desirable to
have around the same number of dogs in both groups. Furthermore the authors should also
provide (and use in the analysis) the actual weight of the subjects. Unfortunately again here there
is a breed-wise difference between their obese (obesity-prone) subjects and the control
groups/subjects as the standard weight of three breeds (two “normal” and one obesity-prone) is
lower (Mudies approx. 8-13 kg; Border collies 12-20 kg; Beagles 9-11 kg) compared to the second
obesity-prone breed Retrievers (25-36 kg). Given that 50% of the total sample of obese dogs (N=8)
come from the Retriever group, this could induce a considerable bias, since the same food item is
10
relatively less intake for a bigger body-sized dog. Thus in order to make the claims that the
authors intend to make they would need at least the same proportion of obese and non-obese
subjects from all breeds they include (this proportion ideally being close to 0.5). The inclusion of
more breeds would also strengthen the results.
I sincerely hope that the authors are willing to undertake the additional data collection and the
re-writing of the manuscript, as their research idea is truly valuable and has the potential to mark
a new direction of research if presented in a believable and understandable way.

We recommend this for publication but the title is actually two titles. Could we please settle on
"the behavior of overweight dogs shows similarity with personality traits of overweight
humans"? Details about ambiguous stimuli and so on are best reserved for the text. Thanks!
Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Rosalind Arden):
Associate Editor
Comments to the Author:
This is an interesting piece of work which has now been read by three reviewers each of whom
has a different view of the study. The reviewers all agree that questions around drivers of obesity
in dogs warrant investigation. My view is that the ms is ready for publication. Reviewer 3 made
some helpful comments which can inform the design of future studies, but I think the work
13
already done deserves to be read. The paper is clearer than it's previous incarnation. I
recommend one more close read through - I noticed an awkwardness on line 376, (did you mean
'Beagles were less likely to choose'?) but such small changes may not be enough to be called a
revision. Well done on choosing a worthwhile topic and the hard work that has obviously gone
into this study.
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors of this paper examine the behaviour (food related cognitive responses) of obese and
normal-weight dogs. I think this is a really important and interesting topic. As research using this
approach is practically non-existent, I believe this paper is very valuable not only because of the
data presented, but also to promote this research line. However, as currently written, I’m afraid
that the manuscript is not suitable for publication. (I do not have access to the original
submission, and judging from the authors’ response to the first round of reviewer comments they
already did some improvements, but I still do not think that the paper is of sufficient quality.)
There are two main issues, the first of which could be addressed in a resubmission. The paper in
its current form is very hard to read. It is not only that the paper is very long (compared to the
usual royal society format), but the sentences are unnecessarily complicated and it often needs
several re-readings to understand. Also for example the Introduction doesn’t seem to follow a
steady logic. (I understand that due to the very nature of the research topic there are quite few
studies that are directly relevant, but it is still a problem that vaguely related literature is just put
next to each other without providing a coherent frame.) I think the paper would highly benefit
from a thorough re-writing so that it is much more concise. And the main issue is not (only) that
the text needs shortening, but they probably need to replace some references to make their point.
My other problem is with how the tests were done, namely subject selection. I think it is rather
unfortunate that the authors mixed two questions (obese individuals and obesity-prone breeds)
into one study. As currently done this highly compromises the results. Their sample had N=16
obese dogs, 14 of which are from two of the four breeds they studied. It is natural that by random
sampling, the authors would get more obese dogs in the obesity-prone breeds, but this way they
cannot disentangle the two factors. Even more troubling is that since they only used four breeds
total (two obesity-prone and two non-obesity-prone) it cannot be excluded that other breed
differences might cause any differences they find. The authors discuss one such breed difference,
and they do argue that selection for cooperative versus non-cooperative work has an effect, but
many other factors might be at play, and these are impossible to control for with so few breeds in
the sample. Just to mention one, both non-obese breeds (Border Collie, Mudi) are herding dogs,
while the obesity-prone breeds are hounds (Beagle) and Gundogs (Retrievers). It is also
problematic that the number of obese dogs (N=16) is very low compared to the N=75 normal
weight dogs. Since obesity is the main factor that the authors test, it would be highly desirable to
have around the same number of dogs in both groups. Furthermore the authors should also
provide (and use in the analysis) the actual weight of the subjects. Unfortunately again here there
is a breed-wise difference between their obese (obesity-prone) subjects and the control
groups/subjects as the standard weight of three breeds (two “normal” and one obesity-prone) is
lower (Mudies approx. 8-13 kg; Border collies 12-20 kg; Beagles 9-11 kg) compared to the second
obesity-prone breed Retrievers (25-36 kg). Given that 50% of the total sample of obese dogs (N=8)
come from the Retriever group, this could induce a considerable bias, since the same food item is
relatively less intake for a bigger body-sized dog. Thus in order to make the claims that the
authors intend to make they would need at least the same proportion of obese and non-obese
subjects from all breeds they include (this proportion ideally being close to 0.5). The inclusion of
more breeds would also strengthen the results.
14
I sincerely hope that the authors are willing to undertake the additional data collection and the
re-writing of the manuscript, as their research idea is truly valuable and has the potential to mark
a new direction of research if presented in a believable and understandable way.
Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-172398.R0)
Dear Editors,
Thank you for the supporting and positive evaluation of our manuscript. It is a great pleasure for
us that our work will hopefully be published in Royal Society Open Science. In this revision we
changed the manuscript's title as it was recommended; and performed a throughout check of the
text with the help of a native English speaker for minor corrections that enhance the easier flow of
the text.
We are also thankful for the efforts of Reviewer 3, who obviously did a throughout job on the
manuscript and provided well-considered recommendations how to improve on the
experimental design of the research. While we agree that it would been more adequate having an
equal proportion of overweight dogs in each breed group, we think that our results still enable us
to disentangle the effect of breed and being overweight on the food responsiveness of the
subjects. The main thing is that we had two so-called obesity prone breeds (Beagles and
Retrievers) with larger number of overweight subjects within, and these behaved differently in
the tests on the level of breed, however overweight subjects (independently of their breed)
behaved similarly. This is why (although cautiously) we can say that body condition had a
stronger effect than breed in our experiment.

REVISION NOTE
Responses to the Reviewers
Dear Editorial Board,
Thank you for evaluating our original submission. After a throughout process of revision, we
submit the revised version of our manuscript. We found many comments and suggestions of
he Editors and Reviewers useful for achieving a hopefully much better version of this paper.
You can find our detailed answers to the comments on the original submission.
On behalf of all the co-authors, sincerely,
Péter Pongrácz, PhD
Department of Ethology, Eötvös Loránd University
Response to Reviewer 1
“I also think the manuscript is rather long and can be tightened up in a few places (5 page
ntro/for example, much of pages 6 and 7 is just a “preview” of what will be repeated in the
methods – 7 pages of methods, can they be made more concise with a diagram or other? – 4
pages of discussion).”
ANSWER – We performed a complete reworking on the manuscript, aiming at a more
concise and straightforward structure. Large sections of the original text were deleted or
considerably shortened, especially in the Introduction. In the revised manuscript the
Introduction was reduced to 3.5. As it was requested, we added an illustration about the
experimental arrangement, and provided a more detailed explanation of our predictions
– also according to the reviewers’ requests. Now the length of the revised manuscript is
674 lines instead of the original 720 (until the end of References).
Specific comments and questions
Title: In lines 424-426, the authors suggest that personality may be a better explanation than
pessimism for obesity. The title of the paper makes it unclear whether the authors consider
pessimism to be a personality trait or if they are referring to other results such as impulsivity.
Anyway, it might be helpful to provide a clearer title that explains the results such as
“Overweight dogs less likely to attend to ambiguous stimuli” etc.
ANSWER – Thank you for this suggestion, we changed the title accordingly. We admit,
he original version was more ‘interesting’ and ‘catchy’, however, the one you suggested
s more correct.
The term ambivalent is used throughout the text to describe the ambiguous choice.
Ambivalent means having conflicting feelings; the word ambiguous would be a better
descriptor of the task.
ANSWER – You are absolutely right, thank you for this note. Mendl et al. (2010) used
“ambiguous” as well, it was our mistake to write “ambivalent”. We changed
“ambivalent” to “ambiguous” throughout the text.
Lines 51-53 – I’m not convinced that dogs and humans share the same environment – do you
have a citation? After all, for pet dogs, their environment is highly dictated by the human
including availability of food and exercise/mental stimulation, all of which highly likely
contribute to obesity in dogs)– who is free to leave the dog’s environment at any time. Frank
McMillan’s review of stress-induced overeating in companion animals may be of interest:
McMillan, F. D. (2013). Stress-induced and emotional eating in animals: a review of the
experimental evidence and implications for companion animal obesity. Journal of Veterinary
Behavior: Clinical Applications and Research, 8(5), 376-385.
ANSWER: Thank you for the reference and the comment. Considering all domesticated
species, we think that it is not an overstatement that the niche of dogs shows the largest
overlap with that of humans. This is not only accepted from the aspect of
evolutionary/cognitive sciences (e.g. Miklósi, Á., & Topál, J. (2013). What does it take to
become “best friends”? Evolutionary changes in canine social competence. Trends in
Cognitive Sciences, 17, 287–294); but it is more and more exploited in applied research
and genetic studies (e.g. Backer, L. C., Grindem, C. B., Corbett, W. T., Cullins, L., &
Hunter, J. L. (2001). Pet dogs as sentinels for environmental contamination. Science of
he Total Environment, 274(1), 161-169.; Khanna, C., Lindblad-Toh, K., Vail, D.,
London, C., Bergman, P., Barber, L., ... & Niemi, S. (2006). The dog as a cancer
model. Nature biotechnology, 24(9), 1065-1066), where authors consider the dog as a
good model/indicator species because of its shared environment with humans. We of
course agree with the Reviewer that humans have a direct authority over the shaping of
dogs’ environment and living conditions, as well as humans have a larger degree of
reedom compared to dogs when it comes to make changes in our environment and
habits. However, this does not go against the general notion that dogs evolved during
heir domestication towards having a compatible set of socio-cognitive capacities to the
anthropogenic niche (Pongrácz, P. (2017). Modeling Evolutionary Changes in
Information Transfer. European Psychologist). By our opinion the recommended
reference from McMillan (2013) also shows that dogs may become overweight due to
similar factors (i.e. impaired welfare-caused stress) that are also typical for human
obesity patients. We found this reference as a very useful one and incorporated it to our
paper.
Lines 64-65 – it might be good to provide the reader with a general definition of cognitive
bias task, as here you are referring to a different paradigm as a cognitive bias task, it is not
necessarily clear at this point if this is similar to the test you will do with dogs.
ANSWER – Thank you for the suggestion – we included a short explanation there (Lines
56-59).
Materials and Methods
Line 151 – citation that some dog breeds are more prone to obesity than others
ANSWER – Done.
Lines 164-165 – how does being over a year of age ensure accepting food in a novel location?
ANSWER – Thank you for the comment, we rewrote this section.
Line 167 – who assessed the dogs, was there inter-rater reliability? Were dog scores collapsed
nto two categories (overweight and not) because I don’t see three weight groups in the data
analysis.
ANSWER – One of the authors (Orsolya Torda) is a practicing veterinarian, she
performed the assessment of body condition. Now we included this to the text (Lines
131-133). As for the body condition categories, there were no BCS 1 (underweight) dogs
n the sample, therefore we used only two categories (normal and overweight) in the
analysis: we clarified this in the revised text
Lines 175-176 – please give the percent of each group that was overweight for easy
comparison
ANSWER – Done.
Line 184 – how many raters coded the video? What was the inter-rater reliability.
ANSWER – An independent rater re-coded the video footages of 12, randomly chosen
subjects. The inter-coder reliability was very high in case of each behavioral variables.
We inserted the details and results of this analysis to the end of the Statistical Analysis
section (Lines 295-304).
Lines 221-222 – in the alternative reward trial, were both rewards placed in the bowl in a
similar manner (this only refers to the empty alternative)
ANSWER – Yes, in all trials of the reward alternative experimental group, the high-
ncentive value food was placed into the bowl invisibly for the dog and the owner,
similarly to the low-incentive value food. We clarified our experimental protocol in the
revised manuscript (lines 181-188).
Lines 227-229 A diagram of the experimental paradigm (including placement of bowls, where
dog and experimenter were) would be helpful
ANSWER – We added a new picture (Figure 1) that shows the experimental scene.
Lines 239-240 – It should be clarified that this is to avoid allowing the dog to examine both
bowls
ANSWER – The word “dog” inserted for clarification (Lines 202-203).
Line 240 – did the dogs always eat the less desirable reward? Was it determined ahead of time
hat the dogs would actually eat the low incentive food? Otherwise, this could have affected
your results on the two reward choice task.
ANSWER – No, some dogs did not eat the low incentive food after choosing the bowl
hat contained it. We have carried out a pre-test phase (lines 156-167) to test for the
preference for each of the offered food items in our test (low-incentive vs. high-incentive
value foods: dogs preferred the latter). However, because we randomly used each bowls,
and the experimental treatments followed in a random order, we do not see how eating
or not the low-incentive value food might have influenced any of our subsequent trials.
Statistical analyses
Were any posthoc/pairwise comparisons done? Was alpha adjusted for multiple comparisons
between breeds? Specifically, for lines 357-359 and 381-382, the effects might be nominal
once alpha is adjusted.
ANSWER – (For both of the cases in question): These statistics are parameter estimates
and the significance tests of these parameter estimates being different from 0, all from
he very same model (see also lines 259-262). Therefore, there is no need to adjust for
multiple comparisons. In other words, for instance, the parameter estimates provided in
ines 338-340 (lines 357-359 in the previous version) all refer to and explain what drives
he single significant effect of experimental group x breed interaction in line 331 (line
351 in the previous version).
Lines 357-359 – why are only comparisons with Retrievers included?
ANSWER – Note, that these are not results of pairwise post-hoc tests (see also our
previous response, and our explanation in lines 259-262). This is how the model
calculates whether there was any difference between different levels of a factor. In our
case, the Retriever was the reference category (chosen arbitrary), and all comparisons
were done based on the baseline response of Retrievers. Note, that the choice of
reference category does not influence whether or not an investigated potential
explanatory variable (e.g. breed, or experimental group) will be significant in the model.
The choice of reference category matters in terms of how well we can show and explain
what caused a significant effect in the model.
At some points in the manuscript, the total number of dogs is 90 (see Lines 160-161 and
Figure 2) but the N is referred to as 91 throughout. Please clarify the number of dogs (both
otal and of each breed) used in the study and analysis and if any dogs were omitted from
analyses.
ANSWER – N=91 is the correct number, this is the amount of subjects we had data
rom. There was a mistyping in case of the number of Golden Retrievers, in reality we
had 8 of them instead of 7. Now this was corrected in the text.
Was a power analysis (posthoc or otherwise) performed?
ANSWER – No, we did not carry out post-hoc power analysis. We share the view and
argue along with many researchers that post-hoc power analyses do not convey any
urther information once we already calculated a p-value (see e.g. Hoenig & Heisey
2001), The abuse of power: The pervasive fallacy of power calculations for data
analysis. The American Statistician Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 19-24). Furthermore, we also
argue that we have a substantial sample size of 91 dogs in our study, so any biologically
significant effect should also come up as statistically significant in our analyses. In
concordance, we report statistically significant results hence, the power of the analyses
must have been large enough to detect these effects.
Results
Line 328: again, please clarify the number of dogs in the study. Rather than just say 66 dogs
completed all 20 trials, can you also provide the range of trials performed among subjects?
ANSWER – Thank you, we clarified sample size throughout the manuscript. We also
provide now descriptive information on number of trials performed by the dogs (lines
308-309).
Were any dogs omitted for not performing a minimum number of trials?
ANSWER – No, all 91 dogs are involved in the analyses.
Lines 352-353 – this would be clearer if rephrased to “overweight dogs were less likely to
choose the indicated bowl”, there are several similar grammatical errors in lines 386-398.
ANSWER – We would prefer to leave the sentence in its original form, because we did
not report on the main effect of body condition (unlike the phrase suggested by the
reviewer). The sentence is indeed complicated, however, this is due to the inherently
complicated two-way interaction effect we intend to describe (lines 331-333).
Discussion
n general, the discussion could be more concise and focus on the two most interesting and
convincing results: overweight dogs were less likely to follow the human point when a more
desirable treat was in the other container, and that they were more likely to drop out of the
ambivalent test trials.
ANSWER – We somewhat shortened the Discussion as the Reviewer suggested.
Lines 395-398 – be clear which task you are referring to when summarizing results – you
switch from one to the other without explaining for the reader.
ANSWER – Done.
Discussion, general question: were there any differences in training history between the
subjects? Could that not be an explanation for some of the differences between individuals or
even breeds?
ANSWER – The subjects of our experiments were average companion dogs, regardless
o the breed. Therefore it was unlikely that from this sample more than a few dogs
would participate in any kind of regular sport activity that required extensive training.
On the other hand, we did not find such breed differences that could be the result of
different amount of training history (i.e. higher success rate in the two-way choice test).
Figures
Figure captions could be improved by briefly summarizing the results/importance of the
inding.
ANSWER – DONE
Figure 1 is not helpful without knowing how many trials on average the dogs who did not
complete the task completed.
ANSWER – We provide now this information in lines 308-309. Otherwise this figure in
question is now Figure 2 (as we included an additional illustration about the test scene).
Figure 2 – the figure legend needs to be fixed; both graphs are not proportion, one is number,
one if proportion. Number is not informative if we don’t know the total number of trials
completed by dogs who did not complete all 20 trials. Again, clarify the number of dogs, the
breed numbers add up to 90.
ANSWER – Thank you for pointing this out: the figure title was corrected accordingly.
Figure 3 – 5 – please explain both axes of the graphs and what they mean. Figure 4 is the most
nteresting/compelling. Figure 5 does not suggest many differences and can be omitted.
ANSWER – We have now inserted brief explanations in figure captions of the Kaplan-
Meier curves. We would prefer to keep figure 5, but willing to re-consider following
editorial advice.
Response to Reviewer 2
Comments to the Author(s)
From what I can discern, the study described in the manuscript tested whether there were
differences between overweight and other dogs in how they responded in a cognitive bias test.
According to the title of the manuscript and text therein, they found that overweight dogs
made 'pessimistic' decisions.
This is a highly interesting topic and I have no reason, based on my reading of the manuscript,
hat there were any problems with the design and methods used. It's also a relevant paper as it
may help to highlight common mechanisms and relationships between obesity and cognition
across taxa.
Unfortunately for me, try as I did, I was unable to follow large, crucial portions of the
manuscript. The writing was just not clear and there were problems with how the paper was
organized, too. As such, I had a difficult time working out what was done procedurally,
statistically, and what the results were. I did not see how the different analyses were
connected to hypotheses or a hypothesis, and, if the latter, whether steps had been taken to
educe the likelihood of type 1 errors.
As such, and this is the first time I've encountered this situation in my 15 years of reviewing,
although I would like to be able to render a decision about this paper, I cannot do so in good
aith. I realize that English is not the authors' first language, and I am really sympathetic, and
have made an effort to get the information, but I simply am not able to.
Given the nature of the problem investigated, and the fact that it would be of interest to a very
broad audience, and the fact that the authors have collected a lot of data and have very likely
analyzed it correctly, I would recommend that the authors seek out a native-English speaker
who works in the same field, and to ask them to carefully proofread a draft and to help them
get it into a state that would enable me to review the paper fully.
ANSWER – Thank you for the evaluation of our manuscript. We are sorry to hear that
we did not achieve our aim to present our study in a concise and clear manner
previously. We did our best during the revision to clarify the text, our analyses and
results. We removed large sections of less important information to improve the flow of
reading, also, we asked a native English speaking researcher to assist us in the process.
We hope, that due to our revision, the manuscript improved substantially.
