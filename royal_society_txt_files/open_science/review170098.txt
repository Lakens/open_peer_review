There is now a reasonable argument for the effect of vitamin E on telomere dynamics which is
really helpful and makes for a more robust prediction. The story starts to become more balanced,
a balance suggested by the title, but at times the text still could more emphasis the fullness of the
effects – it is nice to have oxidative damage characterised by a number of markers – rather than
putting too much emphasis on the telomere dynamics. To do so a few simple edits may suffice.
Specific comments
41-42: as commented in the previous version this is a simplification and does not take into
account recent studies that more critically reflected on this topic. Not sure why this studies on
non-bird species should not be relevant. Don't you use mostly studies on humans to justify an
effect vitamin E on telomere dynamic?
Delay lines 45-48 until line 60. First develop the damage ROS can do, and then bring in the ROS
defence in eggs and that there vitamin E is thought to be an important part of that defence shield.
51: no need to narrow down to telomere dynamic, keep this open as you suggest in your title. At
the moment you still have a conflict between the generality in the title and the unnecessary
narrowing down to telomere dynamics in the introduction. Here you get too much hung up
about telomeres. Instead of insisting on the telomere-centric view, play to the strength of your
study having explored a range of potential damages and include that into the introduction, not
only telomeres (obviously this has to be at the expense of the length of the telomere text if you
need to accommodate the additional material, which is entirely possible).
66-71: that is a bit a selective view of the literature ignoring studies that did not find a
relationship, see for example Guan et al 2012 Gerontology. 58:62-9.
72: I think you need to be careful. Most examples are from humans but birds have telomerase
activity suppressed in somatic tissue, and telomerase activity is not reduced by pro-oxidants but
by cortisol.
75-76: with 'we assessed the effect of a physiological increase in yolk VE concentration on
oxidative status markers and TL of the newly hatched chicks' you undersell your study - you
looked at more than just telomeres.
144: why this study found effects of yolk VE increases on oxidative damage to proteins and lipids
contrary to previous bird studies should be worth discussing.

I have carefully read the manuscript, the comments of referees to a previous version of the ms
and the authors´responses. I think that the authors did a good job in this new review. The text is
well written, the design is clearly explained and the discussion is balanced. Also, the
supplementary information provided in the ESM is clear, aboundant and very helpful, allowing a
potential replication of this design.
The only potential flaw of the study is the use of spectrophotometry-based TBARS assay as a
measure of lipid peroxidation, as pointed by a previous referee, but in my opinion this does not
reduce the merit nor the value of the paper. First, the authors honestly acknowledged in the tex
the limitations of the conclusions based on this techniquet. Second , they used a wide variety of
techniques to assess oxidative status of birds, which increases the value of their study and the
robustness of their estimates of oxidative status. And third, the main conclusions of the study are
raised by the results drawn from other techniques than TBARs.
I have no further comments to add. Just to congratulate the authors for this piece of work.

REPLY: we are pleased of your positive comments and we accepted all your suggestions to improve the
manuscript.
Specific comments
41-42: as commented in the previous version this is a simplification and does not take into account
recent studies that more critically reflected on this topic. Not sure why this studies on non-bird species
should not be relevant. Don't you use mostly studies on humans to justify an effect vitamin E on
telomere dynamic?
REPLY: we rephrased the first sentence of the manuscript by specifying that recent studies indicated that
there is ambiguity over the relationship between the rate of oxygen consumption and the generation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Delay lines 45-48 until line 60. First develop the damage ROS can do, and then bring in the ROS defence
in eggs and that there vitamin E is thought to be an important part of that defence shield.
REPLY: Done, we moved sentence in line 45-48 at line 60.
51: no need to narrow down to telomere dynamic, keep this open as you suggest in your title. At the
moment you still have a conflict between the generality in the title and the unnecessary narrowing down
to telomere dynamics in the introduction. Here you get too much hung up about telomeres. Instead of
insisting on the telomere-centric view, play to the strength of your study having explored a range of
potential damages and include that into the introduction, not only telomeres (obviously this has to be at
the expense of the length of the telomere text if you need to accommodate the additional material,
which is entirely possible).
REPLY: we followed your suggestion and we enlarged the section regarding the adverse effects of
oxidative stress and we did not narrow down only on telomeres.
66-71: that is a bit a selective view of the literature ignoring studies that did not find a relationship, see
for example Guan et al 2012 Gerontology. 58:62-9.
REPLY: we rephrased the sentences of this paragraph also considering that some studies did not find a
positive effect of VE on telomere length, as for instance Guan and coauthors (2012) as you indicated.
72: I think you need to be careful. Most examples are from humans but birds have telomerase activity
suppressed in somatic tissue, and telomerase activity is not reduced by pro-oxidants but by cortisol.
REPLY: We are conscious that the examples we gave regarding the beneficial effects of VE are on
humans or murine models and not on birds, in fact we stated that “the beneficial effect of VE
supplementation on telomere dynamics in birds, mainly during early-life period, is still largely
unexplored, albeit expected”. However, we indicated that the mechanisms underlying the beneficial
effects of VE have not been investigated in birds.
75-76: with 'we assessed the effect of a physiological increase in yolk VE concentration on oxidative
status markers and TL of the newly hatched chicks' you undersell your study - you looked at more than
just telomeres.
REPLY: It is correct, we focused on oxidative status markers (i.e., total antioxidant capacity, amount of
pro-oxidant molecules, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation) and TL. We specified it in the
revised manuscript.
144: why this study found effects of yolk VE increases on oxidative damage to proteins and lipids
contrary to previous bird studies should be worth discussing.
REPLY: As reported on line 144-146, the present study did not find any effect of VE yolk
supplementation on oxidative damage to lipids and proteins according to previous bird studies.

REPLY: We thank you very much for your positive comments regarding our manuscript. We agree the
limitation of measuring lipid peroxidation by the TBARS method so we added a caveat in the introduction
section indicating that TBARS results have to be interpreted with caution. However, no effect of VE
treatment on lipid peroxidation was found.
