In this manuscript, the investigators used the FUCCI system to analyse gene expression at a
specific stage of the cell cycle besides monitoring cell cycle transitions in real time. A single clone
of FUCCI-4 expressing HeLa cells (FUCCI-HeLa cells) was used to monitor the cell cycle in
individual live cells over time by determining the ratios between red and green fluorescence. This
system enabled identification of cytotoxic and cytostatic compounds. Of the 10 flavonoids
screened, apigenin and luteolin, were cytotoxic, while kaempferol, was cytostatic. This system is
useful for screening a library of putative anticancer agents. Appropriate methodology was used
to generate data that has been presented with clarity. The manuscript is generally well written
and the system has potential applications. There are however few concerns that need to be
addressed.
The experiments have been done only in vitro. The authors can explain how this can be translated
in vivo on solid tumours.
In addition to cell cycle kinetics, migration can also be assessed in 3D histoculture. Inclusion of
this assay would have added value. Further, use of FUCCI real-time imaging to visualise
angiogenesis needs mention.
What was the rationale in the choice of the flavonoids and positive control?
Were transfection experiments attempted?
Can this system also measure chemosensitivity & chemoresistance?

Appendix A
Reviewer #1
The experiments have been done only in vitro. The authors can
explain how this can be translated in vivo on solid tumours.
- We agree the reviewer’s comment. The cytotoxic or
cytostatic flavonoids, selected through the first screening
based on FUCCI-HeLa system, need to be validated in vivo.
During drug development process, ‘Hits’ are initially selected
through the first screening process (e.g. high-throughput
screening) and then their efficacy is examined in in vitro
system to find ‘lead compounds’ for further massive in vitro
and in vivo validation. In this study, we aimed to develop the
cell-based system to lively monitor the effect of small
molecules on cell cycle, which would be advantageous for
the initial screening to select ‘Hits’ on cell cycle. Consistent
with our results using FUCCI-HeLa, anti-tumor effect of four
flavonoids (e.g. luteolin [1], apigenin [2], kaempferol [3] or
quercetin [4]) have been already demonstrated in vivo
mouse model. We briefly addressed the efficacy of four
flavonoids proven in in vivo mouse model in the discussion.
Thus, the FUCCI-HeLa based screening system would be
useful for initial screening to identify possible “Hits” showing
novel anti-tumor small molecules from the large number of
small molecule library in future. Text was edited accordingly
(Page 14, line 19-21).
In addition to cell cycle kinetics, migration can also be assessed in
3D histoculture. Inclusion of this assay would have added value.
Further, use of FUCCI real-time imaging to visualise angiogenesis
needs mention.
- As per the reviewer’s valuable comment, use of FUCCI
system for migration and angiogenesis was briefly
mentioned in the discussion. (Page 14, Line 21-24).
What was the rationale in the choice of the flavonoids and positive
control?
- Previously, we demonstrated that quercetin but not
kaempferol induces selective cell death of human
pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) but not differentiated cells
from hPSCs (referred as ‘stem-toxic activity’ [5, 6]) [7],
although cytotoxicity of kaempferol toward various cancer
cells of has been well characterized as similar as that of
quercetin. Considering structural similarity between
quercetin and kaempferol (Fig. 3A), we wondered
whether hydroxyl groups in B and C ring would be
important determinant for their activity. We have
screened those flavonoids with different number of
hydroxyl group on flavonoid backbone for more potent
stem-toxic flavonoid than quercetin (manuscript in
preparation). Accordingly, we chose six flavonoids with
different number of hydroxyl group in the same backbone
(Fig. 3A). In addition, it is generally accepted that glucose
conjugation is effective to deliver any small molecule to
cancer due to high glucose uptake of cancer cells [8, 9].
To this purpose, four flavonoid glycosides were included.
- Positive controls for cell cycle arrest in G1/S, G2 or M
phase to obtain the typical fluorescent profile, thymidine
or 5-FU (for G1/S), Etoposide (for G2), Nocodazole (for
M), all of which are well-characterized to arrest at each
cell cycle phase, was used as well as bleomycin or
camptothecin for cell death (Fig. 2A). Control for mitotic
delay was performed by MLN8237, a selective Aurora A
inhibitor, which has been already reported [10] (Fig. 2B).
Were transfection experiments attempted?
- As described in method section, FUCCI-HeLa cells, used
in this study, were established in RIKEN and were kindly
provided by Dr. SG Hwang [11]. In order to avoid the cell-
to-cell variation, we isolated a single clone from this cell
line as described in the main text. Besides, we had not
performed transfection experiments in this study.
Can this system also measure chemosensitivity &
chemoresistance?
- We deeply appreciate the reviewer’s comment. Frankly
speaking, we had not think of use of FUCCI system for
measuring chemosensitivity. Thanks to the reviewer’s
valuable comment, we came across one remarkable
paper, demonstrating chemoresistant clones using
FUCCI system [12]. Considering the recent theory of
cancer evolution [13], FUCCI model derived from a single
clone would be useful to study this field under constant
challenge with chemotherapeutics when the system is
well-designed. This interesting research subject will be
pursued in the following study.
Did the authors find any false positives and false negatives? What
are the pitfalls of the system?
- Average mitotic time point from G1/S boundary was 720
min (6 hours after release) (Figs. 1D and 2B). However,
depending on the slight variations of condition in each
experiment (e.g. improper removal of residual thymidine
at release or cell density), cell cycle progression was
affected to cause the variation of GF/RF profile. Thus,
vehicle control should be included at every experiment
for minimizing any false positives or negatives. In
addition, as shown in Figure 2A, it would be hard to
differentiate cell death to G1/S arrest only based on
GF/RF profile unless DIC images of cell morphology is
considered.
The authors should include recent literature. The following works
deserve to be cited and the discussion accordingly amended.
1. Yano & Hoffman 2018.
2. Hoffman & Yano, 2018.
3. Yano et al. 2017
4. Yano et al. 2015
- As per the reviewer’s comment, four papers were cited
and briefly described in the discussion section (Page 13,
Line 2-6).
The reference section is not in the journal format. There is no
consistency in citing references. For instance, journal abbreviation
is used in some cases, whereas the full form is given for others.
- We used Endnote software for creating reference. We
checked the endnote output style of Royal society open
science and corrected the error.
Reviewer #2
What was the basis to select these flavonoids?
- We recognized that this issue needs to be clarified
because the reviewer #1 also asked the same question.
Previously, we demonstrated that quercetin but not
kaempferol induces selective cell death of human
pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) but not differentiated cells
from hPSCs (referred as ‘stem-toxic activity’ [5, 6]) [7],
although cytotoxicity of kaempferol toward various cancer
cells of has been well characterized as similar as that of
quercetin. Considering structural similarity between
quercetin and kaempferol (Fig. 3A), we wondered
whether hydroxyl groups in B and C ring would be
important determinant for their activity. We have
screened those flavonoids with different number of
hydroxyl group on flavonoid backbone for more potent
stem-toxic flavonoid than quercetin (manuscript in
preparation). Accordingly, we chose six flavonoids with
different number of hydroxyl group in the same backbone
(Fig. 3A). In addition, it is generally accepted that glucose
conjugation is effective to deliver any small molecule to
cancer due to high glucose uptake of cancer cells [8, 9].
To this purpose, four flavonoid glycosides were included.
-
Dosage of flavonoids to the cells is not mentioned anywhere?
- We feel sorry for inconvenience. Dosage information of
small molecules was described in the figure legend of
each figure. Most of flavonoids were treated with 50<U+F06D>M
for comparison of their activity.
What about the bio compatibility of flavonoids to normal cells. ?
The results presentation can be modified.
- This would be important because a number of flavonoids
has been studied for chemoprevention or anti-cancer
therapeutics. In this study, we did not examine the bio-
comparability of flavonoids to normal cells due to lack of
relevance to the aim of this study. However, we have
shown that quercetin treatment was highly bio-
comparable to human smooth muscle cells (SMCs),
SMCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) or dopaminergic neurons derived from human
embryonic stem, while quercetin treatment induces
strong cell death of human pluripotent stem cells [7].
Thus, we identified quercetin as ‘stem-toxic’ compound to
lower the tumor formation (e.g. teratoma) from human
pluripotent stem cells [6]. We are also aware that
quercetin is currently commercialized as a dietary
supplement in United States and no adverse effects have
been reported even with relatively high doses for long
period [14]. We also found that luteolin, inducing
cytotoxicity toward HeLa-FUCCI (Fig. 3) unlike quercetin
or kaempferol (Fig. 3B) showed the stem-toxic activity,
while SMCs derived from human iPSCs remain
unaffected (manuscript in preparation). According to one
study, cytotoxicity of flavonoids to cultured normal cells is
varied depending on cell type because of susceptibility of
ROS production [15]. Thus, it would be hard to generalize
its bio-comparability to normal cells.
The legends are not clear.
- As per the reviewer’s comment, figure legends were
carefully reviewed and clarified.
In the discussion part the results should be substantiated with the
mechanism behind to support the screening.
- We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. However, with
full respect to the reviewer, this study is aimed to develop
a screening system to identify initial ‘Hits’ affecting cell
cycle using FUCCI system. Thus, mechanism underlying
cytotoxicity or cell cycle arrest in FUCCI-HeLa by
flavonoids would not be the priority. In particular,
mechanistic studies of flavonoids to HeLa cells have
been extensively performed previously [16-18].
