The manuscript deals with preparation and characterization of surfactants in aqueous media.
Although the characterizations are “standard” for self-assembling systems, some features and
novelty makes this paper worth of publication.
I suggest revision as detailed below.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The authors have not satisfactorily responded to following remarks:
1. “The DLS measurements and TEM visualization were done with 10-3 mol·L-1 surfactants
solution which is roughly two orders of magnitude higher concentration than cmc of the
surfactants. Why such a high concentration was used? Knowing that the structure of aggregates
cab change with increasing concentration of surfactant, authors should provide data for the lower
concentrations, i.e. 2 x cmc.”
The authors have not explained why originally, they have chosen high surfactants’
concentrations. Instead of using the opportunity to compare results obtained for low and high
surfactant’s concentrations they have just replaced one results with the other. The comparison
should be given, as well as comment on concentration induced changes.
2. “Looking at the results of conductivity measurements Figs. S4-S6 it seems that in several cases
(e.g. Fig S4 II, Fig. S5 II, Fig. S6 I and II) there is deviation from linearity at concentrations lower
than cmc. This could be a consequence of ioni paring and premicellar associations. I draw the
attention of the authors to Zana’s paper in J. Colloid Interface Sci. 246 (2002) 182-190. Such
analysis of conductivity measurements should be performed.”
Instead of performing analysis of conductivity data authors have just added the comment “It is
7
noteworthy that some results of conductivity measurements (Fig S7 II, Fig. S8 II, Fig. S9 I and II)
seem to deviate from linearity at concentrations lower than CMC. This phenomenon could be a
consequence of ioni paring and premicellar associations [34].”
The analysis of data should be performed, and results adequately discussed.
In addition, I would strongly suggest a correction of English language.

Appendix A
Manuscript “The surface adsorption, aggregate structure and antibacterial activity of gemini
quarternary ammonium surfactants with carboxylic counterions” describe the synthesis, physico-
chemical and biological characterization of novel gemini surfactants. This topic is of high interest for
both scientist working in the field of surfactants, but also for broader public in materials science and
novel materials synthesis, especially since the concepts of green synthesis was used.
However, there are several major and minor remarks to the manuscript, in addition to English
language, which need to be corrected before the paper could be published. The complete list of
remarks is given below.
Major remarks
a) The first step in physico-chemical characterisation of any novel surfactant is determination of
its Krafft temperature, to determine the temperature range in which it can form aggregates.
This data is missing in this manuscript and should be added.
b) The DLS measurements and TEM visualization were done with 10-3 mol L-1 surfactants
solution which is roughly two orders of magnitude higher concentration than cmc of the
surfactants. Why such a high concentration was used? Knowing that the structure of
aggregates cab change with increasing concentration of surfactant authors should provide
data for the lower concentrations, i.e. 2 x cmc.
c) In the description of Gibbs adsorption equation there are several points that need to be
addressed:
- The reference given as a source from which equation is taken is incorrect. M.J. Rosen,
Surfactants and Interfacial Phenomena, second ed., Wiley, New York, 1989. Is one of the
correct references.
- In equation 1 there is no need for the middle part. Also please take notice that physical
variables should be written italic. The correction should be made through the entire text.
- Description of prefactor n should be extended and more precise. A reference Z.X. Li, C.C.
Dong, R.K. Thomas, Langmuir 15 (1999) 4392, should be added.
d) The reference for equation for Gibbs energy of adsorption (eq. 4) and Gibbs energy of
micellization (eq. 3) is also incorrect, it is reference of a review of M.J. Rosen, Surfactants and
Interfacial Phenomena book, not the book itself. The Gibbs energy of micellization should be
calculated using equation:
given in Zana, Langmuir 12 (1996) 1208, using data from conductivity measurements. In line
with this, all data should be recalculated and data from Tables 1 and 2 combined into one
table, for better clarity. In the eq. 4 the factor 6.022, should be corrected to 6.023, according
to Rosen.
Also equation 5 for is not from the reference 18. Above Zana’s equation should be used and
data recalculated.
e) The discussion of properties synthetised surfactants can be improved by comparison with the
behaviour of conventional quarternary ammonium surfactants with carboxylate anion,
although the hydrophobic chain lengths are different, i.e. C12 and C14 (Yan et al. J. Surf.
Deterg. 15 82012) 593.).
f) Looking at the results of conductivity measurements Figs. S4-S6 it seems that in several cases
(e.g. Fig S4 II, Fig. S5 II, Fig. S6 I and II) there is deviation from linearity at concentrations lower
than cmc. This could be a consequence of ioni paring and premicellar associations. I draw
attention of the authors to Zana’s paper in J. Colloid Interface Sci. 246 (2002) 182-190. Such
analysis of conductivity measurements should be performed.
Minor remarks
a) Page 2, line 10Hofmeister should be written with capital H
b) The shorten notation for synthetised surfactants used was n-N2N-n-2Y. It would be simpler
and easier for the readers from the field to change it to commonly used n-2-n-2Y.
c) Page 4, line 7, “to find” should be changed to “to determine”
d) The notations should be uniform throughout the paper
Appendix B
Dear Dr Laura Smith:
Our manuscript–The Surface Adsorption, Aggregate Structure and Antibacterial
Activity of Gemini Quaternary Ammonium Surfactants with Carboxylic
Counterions (RSOS-190378) has been revised according to your comments and the
itemized response to your comments is attached. I am very happy that you give us the
chance to revise my manuscript and very sorry to bring you so much trouble because
of our careless in the manuscript.
Thanks very much again for your attention to our paper. Once again, thank you for your
help to our paper processing.
According to the reviewer comments, we have made the revisions as follows:
The comment from Reviewer 1:
Comment 1
I would recommend to add in the introduction the recent papers on novel surfactant
systems and applications (see for instance J. Phys. Chem. C 2016, 120 (25), 13492-
13502. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b01282; Colloids and Surfaces A:

https://doi.org/10.3390/app8091455). Introduction have to be revised.
Answers and Revisions:
In the manuscript, introduction have been revised. The recent papers on novel
surfactant systems and applications also have been added.
Comment 2
Tables 1 and 2, errors should be estimated and decimals provided accordingly.
Answers and Revisions:
In the manuscript, the data from Tables 1 and 2 has been combined into one table, for
better clarity, and the errors had been provided accordingly.
Comment 3
It is not clear if a0 in Table 3 is the measured experimental parameter. Please clarify.
Answers and Revisions:
In the manuscript, a0 was explained as follows:
where a0 can be approximated to a half of Amin with n=2 [40].
Comment 4
Abstract should be shortened and besides the results should introduce to the thematic
and propose future perspectives.
Answers and Revisions:
Abstract is revised as follows:
A group of gemini quaternary ammonium surfactants with the formula
CnH2n+1CONH(CH2)2N+(CH3)2(CH2)2N+(CH3)2(CH2)2NHCOCnH2n+1·2Y (n=11, 13
and 15, Y=HCOO-, CH3COO- and CH3CHOHCOO-) have been synthesized by a
counterion conversion process and characterized by Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy. Their adsorption and self-aggregation properties
are investigated by surface tension, conductivity, dynamic light scattering and
transmission electron microscopy measurements (TEM). The results show that these
synthesized surfactants reduce the surface tension of water to a minimum value of 26.51
mN·m-1 at a concentration of 5.72 ×10-2 mmol·L-1. Furthermore, the increased alkyl
chain length of the carboxylic counterions leads to the increased critical micelle
concentration (CMC), the decreased degree of counterion binding (ß), and the
decreased self-assembly tendency, but the minimum area per surfactant molecule (Amin)
adsorbed at the air-aqueous solution are similar. TEM images reveal that these
surfactants self-assemble spontaneously into aggregates with vesicles or bilayers
structure. It is also found that they have superior antibacterial activity at a concentration
of 0.1g·L-1. The high surface activity and high antibacterial activity of these gemini
surfactants containing different carboxylic counterions bring more possibilities for their
application in the field of biomedicine.
The comment from Reviewer 2:
Major remarks
Comment a:
The first step in physico-chemical characterisation of any novel surfactant is
determination of its Krafft temperature, to determine the temperature range in which it
can form aggregates. This data is missing in this manuscript and should be added.
Answers and Revisions:
The krafft temperature of these surfactants has been added as follows:
2.4. Measurement of Krafft Temperature (Tk)
1% aqueous solution of the surfactant were prepared and kept in refrigerator for 10 h at
about 7 oC. Then the precipitated system was taken out of the refrigerator and placed in
a low-temperature thermostat bath. DDS-307 conductivity meter (cell constant is 0.997
cm-1) was used to perform the conductivity measurements of these surfactants solution
and each temperature gradient was measured three times to determine the average value
with the standard deviation was less than 0.2 µS·cm-1. The initial temperature of the
solution was controlled as 7±0.1oC and the measurements were carried out in 1 oC
increment with constant stirring by a glass rod.
3.2. Krafft Temperature (Tk)
The krafft temperature of these surfactants was determined from the plot of the specific
conductance (<U+03BA>) vs. temperature in aqueous solution. The corresponding graphs have
been shown in Figure S4-6. Seen from Figure S4-6, in the relatively low temperature
range, the conductance of the surfactant solution has a small change with the increase
of temperature, and then the sharp increase is observed within a relatively narrow
temperature range that represents the sharp increase in surfactant solubility. The Tk of
the surfactants can be obtained from the inflection point of the <U+03BA>-T curve (Table 1).

Comment b:
The DLS measurements and TEM visualization were done with 10-3 mol·L-1
surfactants solution which is roughly two orders of magnitude higher concentration
than cmc of the surfactants. Why such a high concentration was used? Knowing that
the structure of aggregates cab change with increasing concentration of surfactant,
authors should provide data for the lower concentrations, i.e. 2 x cmc.
Answers and Revisions:
Measurement of DLS and TEM are done with the concentration of 2×CMC.
The revision is as follows:
3.5. DLS and TEM Measurments
Rh distributions of these synthesized gemini quaternary ammonium surfactants are
between 40 nm and 2000 nm with little distinction, as shown in Figure S10. In the case
of the same hydrophobic chain length, two peaks are shown in the surfactants with the
formate counterions. One of that is distributed in tens of nanometers though the
intensity of the peak of 13-2-13-2HCOO- is obviously lower than others. Beyond that,
the peak values of gemini surfactants with acetate or lactate counterions are generally
distributed in hundreds of nanometers. The result indicates that the surfactants with
formate counterions tend to form smaller aggregates. Furthermore, the peak of tens of
nanometers may correspond to micro vesicles, and the peak of hundreds of nanometers
may be assigned to more complex aggregates, such as multilamellar vesicles, tubular
micelle, lamellar micelle, etc. Accordingly, the morphology of aggregates of these
gemini surfactants in aqueous solution of the concentration of 2×CMC are further
carried out on TEM measurement, which are shown in Figure 3-5.
Seen from Figure 3-5, the size of these aggregates is practically consistent with
the DLS results. In the system of 11-2-11-2Y, the vesicles structure is seen in the
samples with formate and acetate counterions, but the aggregate of the latter is
deformed and presents an elliptic structure. However, the sample with lactate
counterion shows a mass of bilayers micelles. This indicates that, at the low
concentration of these gemini surfactant solution, the micelles show a trend of transition
from vesicles to bilayers aggregates with the increasing alkyl chain length of
counterions. This trend is also present in the system of 13-2-13-2Y, although the
bilayers structure has already been observed in the sample with formate counterion.
Based on the conductivity data, ß values of these surfactants with lactate counterions
are smaller, which indicates the lower concentration of counterions in the interface
between the micelle and the aqueous solution. This would result in the compression of
the diffusion bilayer and smaller cross-sectional area of the micelle-aqueous interface,
when the surfactants are closely aligned. Therefore, in the similar size of micelles, these
surfactants with longer alkyl chain length of counterions tend to form flat structures.
However, in the system of 15-2-15-2Y, the aggregates with vesicles structure are
formed, and the carboxylic counterions seem have little effect on the structure of the
aggregates. The formation of various micelles is mainly due to the self-organization of
quaternary ammonium cation driven by entropy. So one of the major factors leading to
the differences is the distinction of hydrophobic chain length of these systems.

Comment c:
In the description of Gibbs adsorption equation there are several points that need
to be addressed:
- The reference given as a source from which equation is taken is incorrect. M.J.
Rosen, Surfactants and Interfacial Phenomena, second ed., Wiley, New York, 1989. Is
one of the correct references.
- In equation 1 there is no need for the middle part. Also please take notice that
physical variables should be written italic. The correction should be made through the
entire text.
- Description of prefactor n should be extended and more precise. A reference Z.X.
Li, C.C. Dong, R.K. Thomas, Langmuir 15 (1999) 4392, should be added.

- Description of prefactor n is revised as follows:
The value of n has no effect on the variation trend of the values of Gmax and Amin.
However, it has been widely assumed that it is more appropriate to use a value of 2 for
n, becasuse some reports suggest that as n is 3, the calculated Amin is unacceptably large
[26]. In this case, a value of 2 for n is used to calculate.

Comment d:
The reference for equation for Gibbs energy of adsorption (eq. 4) and Gibbs energy
of micellization (eq. 3) is also incorrect, it is reference of a review of M.J. Rosen,
Surfactants and Interfacial Phenomena book, not the book itself. The Gibbs energy of
micellization should be calculated using equation:
given in Zana, Langmuir 12 (1996) 1208, using data from conductivity measurements.
In line with this, all data should be recalculated and data from Tables 1 and 2 combined
into one table, for better clarity. In the eq. 4 the factor 6.022, should be corrected to
6.023, according to Rosen.
Also equation 5 for is not from the reference 18. Above Zana’s equation should be used
and data recalculated.

Comment e:
The discussion of properties synthetised surfactants can be improved by
comparison with the behaviour of conventional quarternary ammonium surfactants with
carboxylate anion, although the hydrophobic chain lengths are different, i.e. C12 and
C14 (Yan et al. J. Surf. Deterg. 15 82012) 593.).
Answers and Revisions:
The discussion has been added as follows:
The CMC values of the corresponding conventional quarternary ammonium surfactants
with carboxylate anion [CH3(CH2) nCH2N+(CH3)3·A–, n=10, 12, A=HCOO–, CH3COO–]
are 2 order of magnitude higher than the synthetised gemini surfactants, although the
hydrophobic chain lengths are different [29].

Comment f:
Looking at the results of conductivity measurements Figs. S4-S6 it seems that in
several cases (e.g. Fig S4 II, Fig. S5 II, Fig. S6 I and II) there is deviation from linearity
at concentrations lower than cmc. This could be a consequence of ioni paring and
premicellar associations. I draw attention of the authors to Zana’s paper in J. Colloid
Interface Sci. 246 (2002) 182-190. Such analysis of conductivity measurements should
be performed.

Appendix C
Dear Dr Laura Smith:
Our manuscript–The Surface Adsorption, Aggregate Structure and Antibacterial
Activity of Gemini Quaternary Ammonium Surfactants with Carboxylic
Counterions (RSOS-190378R1) has been revised according to your comments and the
itemized response to your comments is attached. I am very happy that you give us the
chance to revise my manuscript and very sorry to bring you so much trouble because
of our careless in the manuscript.
Thanks very much again for your attention to our paper. Once again, thank you for
your help to our paper processing.
According to the reviewer comments, we have made the revisions as follows:
The comment from Reviewer 2:
Comment 1:
“The DLS measurements and TEM visualization were done with 10-3 mol·L-1
surfactants solution which is roughly two orders of magnitude higher concentration
than cmc of the surfactants. Why such a high concentration was used? Knowing that
the structure of aggregates cab change with increasing concentration of surfactant,
authors should provide data for the lower concentrations, i.e. 2 x cmc.”
The authors have not explained why originally, they have chosen high
surfactants’ concentrations. Instead of using the opportunity to compare results
obtained for low and high surfactant’s concentrations they have just replaced one
results with the other. The comparison should be given, as well as comment on
concentration induced changes.
Answers and Revisions:
Measurement of DLS and TEM are done at the concentration of 2×CMC and
1×10-3 mol·L-1.
The revision is as follows:
The DLS data and TEM micrographs of surfactant solutions at a concentration of
2×CMC are frequently used to evaluate their molecular self-assembly behavior. In the
antibacterial activity subsequently discussed, at this concentration (about 0.05 g·L-1),
the bacteriostatic efficiency of these gemini surfactants aqueous solution was
53.9%-80.2% for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. However, at the
concentration of 1×10-3 mol·L-1 (about 0.1 g·L-1), the antibacterial efficiency of these
surfactant solutions is all above 75.3%, most of which are 80%-95%. So, the
self-assembly behavior of these gemini surfactants aqueous solution at higher
concentration (1×10-3 mol·L-1) was also investigated.
Seen from Figure S5, the Rh values of these surfactant solutions with the
concentration of 2×CMC are distributed in the range of 40-2000 nm, while the Rh
values of 1×10-3 mol·L-1 are distributed in the range of 10-3000 nm. It is suggested
that the increasing concentration of these surfactant solutions leads to more diverse
and larger size aggregates. At the concentration of 2×CMC, two peaks are shown in
the surfactants with formate counterion in the case of the same hydrophobic chain
length. One of that is distributed in tens of nanometers though the intensity of the
peak of 13-2-13-2HCOO- is not obvious and the other are generally distributed in
hundreds of nanometers. The result indicates that the surfactants with formate
counterion tend to form smaller aggregates at the low concentration. At the
concentration of 1×10-3 mol·L-1, at least two hydrated radius distribution peaks were
observed. The peak of tens of nanometers may correspond to micro vesicles, and the
peak of hundreds of nanometers may be assigned to more complex aggregates, such
as multilamellar vesicles, tubular micelle, lamellar micelle, etc. Accordingly, the
morphology of aggregates of these gemini surfactants in aqueous solution with the
concentration of 2×CMC and 1×10-3 mol·L-1 have been carried out on TEM
measurement, which are shown in Figure 3-5.
Seen from Figure 3-5, the size of these aggregates is practically consistent with
the results of DLS. In the series of 11-2-11-2Y, at the concentration of 2×CMC,
vesicles with a diameter of about 300 nm are formed in aqueous solution of
11-2-11-2HCOO- and 11-2-11-2CH3COO- (Figure 3 A-I, A-II), while at the
concentration of 1×10-3 mol·L-1, multilamellar vesicles (MLV) with a diameter of
about 500 nm are formed (Figure 3 B-I, B-II). In addition, at the concentration of
2×CMC, a mass of hollow slender bilayers micelles are observed in aqueous solution
of 11-2-11-2CH3CHOHCOO- (Figure 3 A-III), while at the concentration of 1×10-3
mol·L-1, vesicles are formed (Figure 3 B-III). This indicates that the introduction of
-OH and the increase in the length of the alkyl carbon chain in the counterions cause
the deformation of the aggregates at the concentration of 2×CMC, but the effect of
counterions seems to be insignificant at relatively high concentration. This trend is
also present in the series of 13-2-13-2Y. The mixed micelles of vesicles and deformed
bilayers structure are observed in Figure 4 A-I, while uniform short tubular micelles
are observed in Figure 4 A-II and A-III. However, hollow and longish tubular
micelles are all observed among that at a high concentration (Figure 4 B-I, B-II, B-III).
In spite of that, in the series of 15-2-15-2Y, the counterions have little influence on
the self-assembly behavior of these surfatctants whether at a low or high
concentration. Seen from Figure 5, the vesicles with a diameter of about 100-200 nm
are formed at the concentration of 2×CMC, while a mixed micelles of vesicle and
longish tubular structure are formed at the concentration of 1×10-3 mol·L-1. The
formation of various micelles is mainly due to the self-organization of quaternary
ammonium cation driven by entropy. So, one of the major factors leading to the
differences may be the distinction of hydrophobic chain length of these systems.

Instead of performing analysis of conductivity data authors have just added the
comment “It is noteworthy that some results of conductivity measurements (Fig S7 II,
Fig. S8 II, Fig. S9 I and II) seem to deviate from linearity at concentrations lower than
CMC. This phenomenon could be a consequence of ioni paring and premicellar
associations [34].”
The analysis of data should be performed, and results adequately discussed.
Answers and Revisions:
The analysis of data has been performed, and the discussion has been revised as
follows:
This phenomenon could be a consequence of ioni paring or premicellar
associations, which can be analyzed by the shape of <U+03BA> vs c and molar conductivity <U+039B>
( <U+F04C> <U+F03D> (<U+F06B> <U+F02D> <U+F06B> 0 ) / c , <U+03BA>0 is the conductivity of water) vs c0.5 plots at c <CMC [34]. Ion
pairing results in a neutralization of electrical charges and thus in a loss of
conductivity, so the corresponding <U+03BA> vs c and <U+039B> vs c0.5 plots curve toward the
concentration. On the other hand, premicellar association of ionic surfactant gives rise
to small aggregates of surfactant ions, which results in an increase of conductivity of
the solution, therefore the corresponding <U+03BA> vs c plot will show a curvature toward the
<U+03BA> axis. In addition, <U+039B> will increase with c. At higher concentration, where micelles
appear in the solution and bind counterions, the value of <U+039B> will start decreasing. Thus,
the plot of <U+039B> vs c0.5 will present a maximum. So according to Figure S3 A-II, B-II, C-
I and C-II, and Figure S4, ion pairing may occur in solutions of 11-2-11-2CH3COO-,
13-2-13-2CH3COO- and 15-2-15-2CH3COO-, and premicellar association may be
present for 15-2-15-2HCOO-.
