The revised article “An Environmental Friendly Method For Determination of Methylphenol in
Water Samples Coupled with High Performance Liquid Chromatography” gave a lot of
information about additive of the salts to improve the cloud point extraction to help the
separation of the methylphenol. The importance of the paper is to test the effect of various
parameters on the separation effect. However, the separation effect is opaque for the data
presentation, and the story is not complete because the statement is not persuasive.
Unfortunately, this paper needs to be rejected. The paper needs further statement and
improvement to be accepted. Large adjustment is needed to improve the paper quality. Here is
attached with the details about the manuscript modification:
1. Page 5. The investigated parameters include the concentration of salt, surfactant, extraction
time and temperature. Could you explain why to use these parameters for the following study?
2. Page 5. The section 2.2 is not important message in the text, and you can integrate these
descriptions into the detailed procedures (e.g., instrumentation, CPE procedure) instead of
individually listing an independent section to express the information.
3. Page 6. How to control the concentration of salt, surfactant, extraction time and temperature in
the experimental procedures should be mentioned to give full description of the experimental
procedures.
4. Page 7. In section 3.1. The conclusion was that "The recovery of methylphenol increased when
the salt composition was increased and attained optimum value at 1.0 M for the additives
studied". However, only based on two point data (0.5 and 1 M concentration of salt) is not
enough to derive such conclusion. It is possible that at 0.25 M concentration of salt, the
percentage recovery may be increased and at least one more concentration is needed to further
confirm the conclusion.
5. Page 8. In figure 2, the 5% and 15% concentration of surfactants are also investigated, and thus
the statement "The effects of Sylgard 309 surfactant concentration are studied at different
concentrations 10% (w/v), 20% (w/v), 30% (w/v), 40% (w/v) and 50% (w/v)." should also
mention the % and 15%,
6. Page 9. For the 20-40% (w/v), the recoveries for both non-additive and BMIMBr were
decreasing, different from other trends in Figure 2. Could you explain this phenomenon?
7. Page 10. Could you explain why the temperature increase would inhibit the percentage
recovery?
8. Page 11. In section 3.4, to derive a conclusion, the statistically different comparison (p<0.05)
between two conditions is needed to derive the conclusion that one is significantly different or
greater than other conditions. However, in this section, the data reporting between various
extraction time needs to be completed, and the p-value is needed to indicate if one is greater than
another one. If not, the conclusion that 5 min is the best is forfeited and not validated.
9. Page 12. The phrase "In the cloud point extraction" should use the abbreviation for "cloud point
extraction" instead because you have mentioned the abbreviation before.
10. Page 13. For ion concentration descriptions for various ions, what do you mean by the
moderate concentration? How much concentration it is actually added in the solution to process
the reaction.
11. Page 16. In section 3.8, for figure 8, since there is standard deviation for all conditions,
triplicate measurements are at least processed to obtain these results, and thus these steps should
be mentioned in the experimental procedures.
3
12. Page 20. The HPLC diagrams are not needed to show. The data about the surfactant
concentration are the most important, and these data are better to show. The graphs are better to
be placed in the supplementary information.
13. For table 2, it is better to give the full name of all abbreviation in the left column, in the note
under the table, and thus the information given by the table is easy to follow.
14. The application value of this study needs to be explained if having specific application
available for this study.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The manuscript entitled “An Environmental Friendly Method for Determination of Methylphenol
in Water Samples Coupled with High Performance Liquid Chromatography” was reviewed. This
manuscript describes the development and optimisation of an extraction method for
methylphenol using Sylgard 309 with three types of additives. Optimisation parameters were
based on concentration of surfactant, pH, temperature, concentration of ionic strength and
extraction time. The manuscript provides valuable information in terms of optimised conditions
for best extraction of methylphenol and also shows application of the extraction procedure for
mehtylphenol found in real water samples. The work no doubt adds to the knowledge in this
field of study though it does require more detailed explanations for some results observed. The
language in this manuscript also needs to be vastly improved as it detracts from the true meaning
of the results. I started off correcting some the language but it became too much to correct and I
therefore advise the authors to carry out a thorough check Detailed comments are as follows:
1. Abstract, line 33 – the sentence starting “The effects of …” needs to be written properly. I
should read as “…..different additive performances on methylphenol...”.
2. Abstract, line 36 – should read as “… RSD less than 10%.” In addition, What about other
validation tests such as LOD and LOQ? The main aim of this paper is to develop a method for
the analysis of methylphenols. In any method development manuscript extensive validation
4
must be done to prove that the method is reliable and produces true results. LOD and LOQ
should be included in the abstract to show that sufficient validation has been carried out.
3. Page 2, line 8 – should read as “…...pollutants exist extensively in the environment.”
4. Page 2, line 24 - Provide more information on the toxicity of the compound. The next line says
that it is used in medicine and perfumes so humans are exposed to it but what then makes it
toxic. This needs a further explanation.
5. Page 4, lines 28-30 – check spelling.
6. Page 6, line 21 – write the chemical formula correctly with the numbers in subscript.
7. Page 6, line 25 - How was the volume of the surfactant-rich phase measured? Provide more
detail. The next sentence states that the phases were separated. How were the phases separated?
Were they decanted or removed with a pipette? More details are required.
8. Heading 3.1 - Rephrase to "Effect of ionic strength"
9. Page 8, line 36 - There is a clear stablilisation of the percentage recovery at 15 M (Figure 2),
however the authors stated that concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 M were investigated. How
did a result at 15 M come about? There is also a result at 5 M....how did this value come about?
Where concentrations of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 M investigated? This should be corrected in the
text.
10. Page 9, line 13 - How does viscosity of the surfactant - rich phase affect recovery? Explain
further.
11. Page 12, line 53 states that there was good interaction between the methylphenol and Sylgard
309. What sort of interaction could this be? Could it be hydrophobic interaction or some other?
It would be good to identify the interaction with a possible explanation of how the authors
arrived at that.
12. Page 13, line 33 states that the ions did not interfere with the extraction bBut Figure 6 does
show some changes in the % recovery so surely there were some effects....after carrying out
statistical analysis one may find that they were not significant changes. However, one cannot say
that there were no interferences.
13. Page 15, line 42 states figure 4.8. Which figure is this? There is no figure 4.8 in the
manuscript.
14. Page 16, line 49 states figure 4.10. Which figure is this? There is no figure 4.10 in the
manuscript.
15. Page 19, line 23 states Table 4.1. Which table is this? There is no Table 4.1 in the manuscript.
16. Page 22, line 17 states that this is the first report of Sylgard 309 being used for extraction of
methylphenols. But the above Table shows that Norseyrihan, Noorashikin, et al., 2016
did similar experiments using Sylgard 309. Surely, this is therefore not the first report of Sylgard
309 but rather the first report of an optimised method using Sylgard 309.
17. The complete manuscript needs to be thoroughly checked for language and grammar.

The paper quality is good to be accepted after a small modification for the title.

The manuscript has improved and all queries made by the reviewers have been answered. The
language of the manuscript needs improvement before it is published. A few minor comments
13
are as follows:
1. Page 3, lines 14-18 - Provide specific limitations of each extraction method. Drawbacks are
mentioned but what are these drawbacks? They have not been mentioned so how can the reader
believe that CPE does overcome those drawbacks.
2. Page 4, line 36 - Should this not be Conservation?
3. Page 10, figure 2 - The authors speak about (w/v) % yet Figure 2 shows concentration in
molarity. Should the units for concentration be changed to % (w/v)? This section only describes
% (w/v) and there is no mention of molarity.

The paper quality is good to be accepted after a small modification for the title.
1. The title needs to be shortened, and to emphasize the CPE method in the title since the paper
focused on the CPE method to separate and determine methylphenol..

The manuscript has improved and all queries made by the reviewers have been answered. The
language of the manuscript needs improvement before it is published. A few minor comments
are as follows:
1. Page 3, lines 14-18 - Provide specific limitations of each extraction method. Drawbacks are
mentioned but what are these drawbacks? They have not been mentioned so how can the reader
believe that CPE does overcome those drawbacks.
2. Page 4, line 36 - Should this not be Conservation?
3. Page 10, figure 2 - The authors speak about (w/v) % yet Figure 2 shows concentration in
molarity. Should the units for concentration be changed to % (w/v)? This section only describes
% (w/v) and there is no mention of molarity.

Title: An Environmental Friendly Method For Determination Of Methylphenol In Water
Samples Coupled With High Performance Liquid Chromatography.
Reviewer 1:
The reviewer’s comments are extracted and addressed as below:
Reviewer’s comment:
The revised article “An Environmental Friendly Method For Determination of Methylphenol
in Water Samples Coupled with High Performance Liquid Chromatography” gave a lot of
information about additive of the salts to improve the cloud point extraction to help the
separation of the methylphenol. The importance of the paper is to test the effect of various
parameters on the separation effect. However, the separation effect is opaque for the data
presentation, and the story is not complete because the statement is not persuasive.
Unfortunately, this paper needs to be rejected. The paper needs further statement and
improvement to be accepted. Large adjustment is needed to improve the paper quality.
Authors’ response:
Thank you for your feedback on our submitted manuscript. The authors really appreciate the
comments and suggestions in order to improve the quality of the manuscript. This article has
its uniqueness where it can attract readers to understand the simple, fast, efficient and low cost
technique which was developed using a green surfactant. This method promotes the protection
of the environment and human health by the extraction the pollutant in the water samples.
We really hope the reviewer satisfy with the responses.
1. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 5. The investigated parameters include the concentration of salt, surfactant, extraction
time and temperature. Could you explain why to use these parameters for the following
study?
Authors’ response:
The parameters such as concentration of salt, surfactant, extraction time and temperature is
investigated to check whether the selected parameters will have influenced the performances
of the cloud point extraction method. The literature review has been conducted before we
selected the parameters to ensure the parameters are suitable for the study.
2. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 5. The section 2.2 is not important message in the text, and you can integrate these
descriptions into the detailed procedures (e.g., instrumentation, CPE procedure) instead of
individually listing an independent section to express the information.
Authors’ response:
The authors are very grateful with the comments and recommendations in order to improve the
quality of this paper. The authors have integrated the information from Section 2.2 into Section
2.1.
3. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 6. How to control the concentration of salt, surfactant, extraction time and temperature
in the experimental procedures should be mentioned to give full description of the
experimental procedures.
Authors’ response:
The authors agree with the reviewer’s recommendation to provide the important data such as
the procedure to control the parameters such as concentration of salt, surfactant, extraction
time and temperature in the experimental procedures. These details has been added in the
Section 2.4.
4. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 7. In section 3.1. The conclusion was that "The recovery of methylphenol increased when
the salt composition was increased and attained optimum value at 1.0 M for the additives
studied". However, only based on two-point data (0.5 and 1 M concentration of salt) is not
enough to derive such conclusion. It is possible that at 0.25 M concentration of salt, the
percentage recovery may be increased and at least one more concentration is needed to further
confirm the conclusion.
Authors’ response:
The authors have checked the concern rose by the reviewer. At 0.25 M concentration of salt
didn’t give phase separation for cloud point extraction. Therefore, authors cannot add one
more point of the concentration in the graph. Based on the experienced of authors that
conducted the similar experimental using the same surfactant, the lower concentration of salts
(less than 0.5 M) or higher concentration of salts (more than 2.0 M) did not give a good phase
separation. This is because the precipitation will have occurred at the bottom of the CPE tube.
5. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 8. In figure 2, the 5% and 15% concentration of surfactants are also investigated, and
thus the statement "The effects of Sylgard 309 surfactant concentration are studied at different
concentrations 10% (w/v), 20% (w/v), 30% (w/v), 40% (w/v) and 50% (w/v)." should also
mention the % and 15%,
Authors’ response:
The authors admit the mistakes and the corrections have been done accordingly. The new
sentence is provided in the revised manuscript. (Section 3.2).
6. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 9. For the 20-30% (w/v), the recoveries for both non-additive and BMIMBr were
decreasing, different from other trends in Figure 2. Could you explain this phenomenon?
Authors’ response:
The value of the percentage of recoveries for non-additive and BMIMBr shows slightly
decreased when the surfactant concentration is increased from the 20-30% (w/v). This is maybe
come from the volume of surfactant rich phase that produced in the CPE is not consistent.
Therefore, the reproducibility of data for these addition of the BMIMBr in the CPE solution
didn’t give a consistent result. The samples have been triplicated to get run using HPLC-UV.
The data shows that the peak in HPLC is not consistently appeared when using BMIMBr and
without additive. The authors hope the reviewer satisfy with the justifications.
7. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 10. Could you explain why the temperature increase would inhibit the percentage
recovery?
Authors’ response:
A few study on temperature effect for the CPE mentioned that temperature will give effect on
the dehydration of the micelle in the surfactant rich phase and will give effect on the volume of
the surfactant rich phase. If the volume of the surfactant rich phase is small, the concentrated
paraben will be measured at the higher concentration.
But this not agreed with our study, this is because the temperature didn’t give significant effect
on the percentage recoveries of parabens. These results proved that temperature does not affect
the dehydration of the micelle and the volume of surfactant-rich phase indicating that
surfactamt can be dehydrated at room temperature.
8. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 11. In section 3.4, to derive a conclusion, the statistically different comparison (p<0.05)
between two conditions is needed to derive the conclusion that one is significantly different or
greater than other conditions. However, in this section, the data reporting between various
extraction time needs to be completed, and the p-value is needed to indicate if one is greater
than another one. If not, the conclusion that 5 min is the best is forfeited and not validated.
Authors’ response:
For the Section 3.4, the author apologized the reviewer because that authors not conducted the
p-value calculation. The authors are relying on the data from the experimental that has been
run for triplicates. When the data obtained, the authors calculated the relative standard
deviation for each parameters. From the literature search as well, there is limited information
about the research that conducted the statistical to obtain the p-value for the extraction time.
The authors cannot find one to refer.
9. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 12. The phrase "In the cloud point extraction" should use the abbreviation for "cloud
point extraction" instead because you have mentioned the abbreviation before
Authors’ response:
The authors admit the mistakes and the corrections have been done accordingly.
10. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 13. For ion concentration descriptions for various ions, what do you mean by the
moderate concentration? How much concentration it is actually added in the solution to
process the reaction.
Authors’ response:
The moderate concentration are referred to the 50 ppm. The 50 ppm concentration for each
ion have been added to the solution to investigate the effect of ions in this extraction.
11. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 16. In section 3.8, for figure 8, since there is standard deviation for all conditions,
triplicate measurements are at least processed to obtain these results, and thus these steps
should be mentioned in the experimental procedures.
Authors’ response:
The authors admit the mistakes and the corrections have been done accordingly.
12. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 20. The HPLC diagrams are not needed to show. The data about the surfactant
concentration are the most important, and these data are better to show. The graphs are better
to be placed in the supplementary information.
Authors’ response:
Thank you for the recommendation. The authors have make changes on the HPLC diagram
are move to the appendix.
13. Reviewer’s comment:
For table 2, it is better to give the full name of all abbreviation in the left column, in the note
under the table, and thus the information given by the table is easy to follow.
Authors’ response:
Thank you for the recommendation. The authors have make changes on the Table 2.
14. Reviewer’s comment:
The application value of this study needs to be explained if having specific application
available for this study.
Authors’ response:
Thank you for the recommendation. There is no specific application for this study.
Referee 2:
1. Reviewer’s comment:
Abstract, line 33 – the sentence starting “The effects of …” needs to be written properly. I
should read as “…..different additive performances on methylphenol...”.
Authors’ response:
The authors have corrected based on the comments.
2. Reviewer’s comment:
Abstract, line 36 – should read as “… RSD less than 10%.” In addition, What about other
validation tests such as LOD and LOQ? The main aim of this paper is to develop a method for
the analysis of methylphenols. In any method development manuscript extensive validation
must be done to prove that the method is reliable and produces true results. LOD and LOQ
should be included in the abstract to show that sufficient validation has been carried out.
Authors’ response:
The authors have corrected based on the comments.
3. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 2, line 8 – should read as “…...pollutants exist extensively in the environment.”
Authors’ response:
The authors have corrected based on the comments.
4. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 2, line 24 - Provide more information on the toxicity of the compound. The next line says
that it is used in medicine and perfumes so humans are exposed to it but what then makes it
toxic. This needs a further explanation.
Authors’ response:
Thank you for the recommendation. The authors have provide more information on the
toxicity of the compound.

The authors have corrected based on the comments.
6. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 6, line 21 – write the chemical formula correctly with the numbers in subscript.
Authors’ response:
The authors admit the mistakes and the corrections have been done accordingly
7. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 6, line 25 - How was the volume of the surfactant-rich phase measured? Provide more
detail. The next sentence states that the phases were separated. How were the phases
separated? Were they decanted or removed with a pipette? More details are required.
Authors’ response:
Thank you for the recommendation. The authors have provided more detail on the
commented aspects.
8. Reviewer’s comment:
Heading 3.1 - Rephrase to "Effect of ionic strength"
Authors’ response:
The authors have rephrased the subtitle based on the comments.
9. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 8, line 36 - There is a clear stablilisation of the percentage recovery at 15 M (Figure 2),
however the authors stated that concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 M were investigated.
How did a result at 15 M come about? There is also a result at 5 M....how did this value
come about? Where concentrations of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 M investigated? This should
be corrected in the text.
Authors’ response:
The authors admit the mistakes and the corrections have been done accordingly. The new
sentence is provided in the revised manuscript. (Section 3.2).
10. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 9, line 13 - How does viscosity of the surfactant - rich phase affect recovery? Explain
further.
Authors’ response:
The viscosity of the surfactant is given effect on the performance of the surfactant. This is
because if the surfactant has a higher viscosity, it will affect the phase separation (not appeared
the two layer of separation which is surfactant-rich phase and aqueous phase). Other than that,
the performance of the surfactant also will decrease. The surfactant cannot attract the
parabens in the water samples. Thus, the low percentage of recovery of paraben extractions
will obtained.
11. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 12, line 53 states that there was good interaction between the methyl phenol and
Sylgard 309. What sort of interaction could this be? Could it be hydrophobic interaction or
some other? It would be good to identify the interaction with a possible explanation of how
the authors arrived at that.
Authors’ response:
Thank you for the recommendation. The authors have added explanation to this part.
The interaction between the methyl phenol and Sylgard 309 are hydrogen bonding.
Figure 8 Proposed mechanism of CPE-Sylgard and GLDA.
12. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 13, line 33 states that the ions did not interfere with the extraction but Figure 6 does
show some changes in the % recovery so surely there were some effects.... after carrying out
statistical analysis one may find that they were not significant changes. However, one cannot
say that there were no interferences.
Authors’ response:
The authors admit the mistakes and the corrections have been done accordingly. The new
sentence is provided in the revised manuscript.
13. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 15, line 42 states figure 4.8. Which figure is this? There is no figure 4.8 in the
manuscript.
Authors’ response:
The authors admit the mistakes and the corrections have been done accordingly. There is no
Figure 4.8.
14. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 16, line 49 states figure 4.10. Which figure is this? There is no figure 4.10 in the
manuscript.
Authors’ response:
The authors have corrected based on the comments.
15. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 19, line 23 states Table 4.1. Which table is this? There is no Table 4.1 in the manuscript.
Authors’ response:
The authors have corrected based on the comments.
16. Reviewer’s comment:
Page 22, line 17 states that this is the first report of Sylgard 309 being used for extraction of
methylphenols. But the above Table shows that Norseyrihan, Noorashikin, et al., 2016 did
similar experiments using Sylgard 309. Surely, this is therefore not the first report of Sylgard
309 but rather the first report of an optimised method using Sylgard 309.
Authors’ response:
The authors admit the mistakes and the corrections have been done accordingly.
17. Reviewer’s comment:
The complete manuscript needs to be thoroughly checked for language and grammar.
Authors’ response:
The manuscript has gone through a proof reading process by an English expert.
