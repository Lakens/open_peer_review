Dear Editor,
Below is my review of the manuscript by Adams et al. The manuscript is well written and the
reported study is interesting and conducted with great experimental control. The research
question is also clearly described, and important as it is currently unclear how effects of ICT on
behaviour can be explained. So my overall evaluation of the manuscript is positive. However,
there are also some points that require revision before I can recommend the manuscript for
publication.
Introduction:
With regard to the describing the theoretical rationale I have 2 comments. First, from the methods
it seems that the authors aimed to examine 2 mechanisms, a) ICT increases global inhibition and
b) ICT creates stimulus-stop associations. However, this is not very clear from the introduction.
Second, the authors suggest in the introduction that a recent meta-analysis failed to detect effects
of ICT on stimulus devaluation. This is correct, but it is important to note that this meta-analysis
was performed primarily on evaluations as measured with the implicit association test. Other,
and more recent work has shown that ICT does lead to devaluation on explicit measures of
evaluation and value (e.g., Chen et al., 2016, JEP:General; Wessel et al., 2014; JEP:General).
Furthermore, if anything, the evidence for devaluation as a working mechanism for the
effectiveness of ICT on (eating) behaviour seems stronger than for the other two candidates (i.e.,
training of global inhibition or acquiring stimulus-stop associations; for a recent review on the
possible mechanisms see Veling et al., 2017; Current Addiction Reports). So I think this part on
mechanisms requires a more nuanced discussion. And do the authors think the mechanisms may
be different or similar for cigarette stimuli compared to other kinds of stimuli such as alcoholic
beverages or food?
Methods / Results
The authors conducted a very well controlled experiment and the participant selection is clear.
However, there is no justification for the selected sample size. I think this aspect is important
because the effects on behaviour seem promising and of a reasonable effect size, but statistically
weak. The overall sample size seems reasonable in light of earlier work in this domain on other
kinds of stimuli. Nonetheless, could it be that the study was, in hindsight, somewhat
underpowered? Of course, a priori determining the sample size is very hard when performing a
new study like this, but it would be good to discuss this aspect to guide future work. The authors
may also consider to use Bayesian statistics to test whether the null-findings on the inhibition
measures provide evidence for the null hypothesis or are inconclusive.
The authors report that they used time since first button press as a measure of smoking resistance
on page 7, but on page 8 they report that they will perform a logistic regression on the smoking
resistance data (i.e., on whether people smoked or not). This seems inconsistent and raises the
question to what degree these measures lead to similar results, and which of these analyses is the
main analysis.
Could the authors have expected a relation between craving and smoking resistance?
Discussion
The authors employed a control condition in which participants trained inhibition on 50% of the
trials (compared to 100% in the active condition). From this perspective, the control condition
3
seems quite conservative. Would the authors expect stronger effects with a control condition that
does not include smoking related stimuli?
The fact that commission errors increased from pre to post may be caused by the fact that the
go/no-go trials included 75% go trials and participants pre-potent responses may hence have
become stronger over time. This aspect may have obscured the training effect.
Could the fact that craving increased less for participants in the experimental compared to the
control group be explained by demand characteristics?
The authors may also consider to tune down the main optimistic conclusion somewhat.

This study explored the effects of inhibitory control training (ICT) on response inhibition towards
smoking-related cues, ability to resist smoking and cigarette use. This is an important area of
investigation with potential clinical utility. Overall the manuscript is concise and clearly written;
there are just a few omissions and issues of clarity which merit attention.
• How was ‘cigarette use’ measured?
• Materials, p. 5: ‘Timeline Follow-Back’ – please explain what this is, what it is designed
to measure, how participants completed it and what time-period it related to (I presume it relates
to the cigarette use measure referred to above but this is not clear and more information would be
useful here).
• Procedure p.7 states that participants had the opportunity to earn a maximum of £4 – so
does this mean that time was terminated after 20 minutes and anyone resisting cigarettes during
that time period were regarded as ‘abstainers’?
• Results – number of cigarettes smoked (p.10) – as noted above, it would be useful to
know over what time period this relates. It is quite possible that the effect of ICT wears off fairly
quickly so it may have an effect on same day smoking but not on smoking for the rest of the
week. Did the authors explore this?

• Results – smoking resistance (p.10): It would be useful to provide a contingency table
here showing how many people smoked or abstained. Did the authors consider using a linear
regression model to explore effects of ICT on time to smoke?

Reviewer: 1
1. With regard to describing the theoretical rationale I have 2 comments. First, from the
methods it seems that the authors aimed to examine 2 mechanisms, a) ICT increases global
inhibition and b) ICT creates stimulus-stop associations. However, this is not very clear from
the introduction.
We agree with the reviewer that the distinction between the two possible mechanisms
underlying ICT could be clearer in the manuscript. We have modified the text on pages 3-4 to
reflect this.
2. Second, the authors suggest in the introduction that a recent meta-analysis failed to detect
effects of ICT on stimulus devaluation. This is correct, but it is important to note that this
meta-analysis was performed primarily on evaluations as measured with the implicit
association test. Other, and more recent work has shown that ICT does lead to devaluation on
explicit measures of evaluation and value (e.g., Chen et al., 2016, JEP:General; Wessel et al.,
2014; JEP:General). Furthermore, if anything, the evidence for devaluation as a working
mechanism for the effectiveness of ICT on (eating) behaviour seems stronger than for the
other two candidates (i.e., training of global inhibition or acquiring stimulus-stop
associations; for a recent review on the possible mechanisms see Veling et al., 2017; Current
Addiction Reports). So I think this part on mechanisms requires a more nuanced discussion.
And do the authors think the mechanisms may be different or similar for cigarette stimuli
compared to other kinds of stimuli such as alcoholic beverages or food?
Again, we agree with the reviewer and have presented a clearer discussion of these findings
on page 3-4, highlighting the mixed evidence for the mechanism underlying the effectiveness
of ICT. We also state that the mechanism underlying ICT in cigarette smoking is not clear,
and validates our measurement of global inhibition and cue-specific inhibition/devaluation in
our study.
3. The authors conducted a very well controlled experiment and the participant selection is
clear. However, there is no justification for the selected sample size. I think this aspect is
important because the effects on behaviour seem promising and of a reasonable effect size,
but statistically weak. The overall sample size seems reasonable in light of earlier work in
this domain on other kinds of stimuli. Nonetheless, could it be that the study was, in
hindsight, somewhat underpowered? Of course, a priori determining the sample size is very
hard when performing a new study like this, but it would be good to discuss this aspect to
guide future work. The authors may also consider to use Bayesian statistics to test whether
the null-findings on the inhibition measures provide evidence for the null hypothesis or are
inconclusive.
We have now included a sensitivity power calculation on page 8 and have discussed the
possibility of the study being underpowered on page 12.
Re-analysis of the inhibition measure data using repeated-measures Bayesian ANOVAs
indicated that, for the global and cue-specific tasks, there was evidence in favour of a simple
Time model only (BFs = 2.23 and 17.81 respectively). There was strong evidence that the
interaction models did not fit the data in either task (BFs = 0.17 and 0.04 respectively),
indicating that the null hypothesis is a better explanation of the data. These analyses are
presented in more detail in the *Bayesian Statistics* file. These analyses can be included in
the paper if required.
4. The authors report that they used time since first button press as a measure of smoking
resistance on page 7, but on page 8 they report that they will perform a logistic regression on
the smoking resistance data (i.e., on whether people smoked or not). This seems inconsistent
and raises the question to what degree these measures lead to similar results, and which of
these analyses is the main analysis.
The smoking resistance task was administered and data collected as indicated on page 7,
with time to first button press as the measure of smoking resistance. However, data screening
revealed a binomial distribution of latency (reaction time) to “first button push” data.
Therefore, a binary variable of smoking resistance was created with responses categorised as
either button pushed (smoked) or non-button pushed (abstained). This has been explained in
the data analysis section on page 8.
5. Could the authors have expected a relation between craving and smoking resistance?
We did not anticipate an association between cigarette craving and ability to resist smoking.
A binary logistic regression did not reveal that craving was associated with greater odds of
smoking resistance.
6. The authors employed a control condition in which participants trained inhibition on 50%
of the trials (compared to 100% in the active condition). From this perspective, the control
condition seems quite conservative. Would the authors expect stronger effects with a control
condition that does not include smoking related stimuli?
We agree with the reviewer that the control training is conservative due to the 50% inhibition
contingency and the inclusion of smoking-related stimuli. We would anticipate a stronger
effect with a control training condition that did not include these features. We have addressed
this in our discussion section on page 11, with the recommendation that future research
examine this.
7. The fact that commission errors increased from pre to post may be caused by the fact that
the go/no-go trials included 75% go trials and participants pre-potent responses may hence
have become stronger over time. This aspect may have obscured the training effect.
Again, we agree with this possibility and have included discussion of this on page 11.
8. Could the fact that craving increased less for participants in the experimental compared to
the control group be explained by demand characteristics?
We observed a main effect of time on craving, such that craving increased for all
participants. An interaction of time x training on craving was not shown. However, we agree
that there is a possibility that participants were aware of their allocation to either the
experimental or control condition. However, we minimised the likelihood of demand
characteristics in the ICT and control task by asking participants to inhibit their response to
a shape target in the corner of the cigarette/neutral image rather than the image itself.
9. The authors may also consider to tune down the main optimistic conclusion somewhat.
We have changed the section on page 12 to reflect this suggestion
Reviewer: 2
1. How was ‘cigarette use’ measured?
Cigarette use was measured at pre- and post-training using a timeline follow-back
procedure, administered via questionnaire. This widely used methodology asks participants
to estimate the number of cigarettes they have smoked over a given period, prompting them to
think about certain situations e.g. going out with friends, having an exam. We have made this
clearer on page 5.
2. Materials, p. 5: ‘Timeline Follow-Back’ – please explain what this is, what it is designed to
measure, how participants completed it and what time-period it related to (I presume it relates
to the cigarette use measure referred to above but this is not clear and more information
would be useful here).
For a description of the TLFB please see the response above. In reference to the time periods
for completion, these have now been added to the procedure section on pages 6-8.
3. Procedure p.7 states that participants had the opportunity to earn a maximum of £4 – so
does this mean that time was terminated after 20 minutes and anyone resisting cigarettes
during that time period were regarded as ‘abstainers’?
The smoking resistance task lasted for only 20 minutes. We ran a pilot study to refine the
duration of this measure. Our initial measure for this task was time to first button press, at
which participants could smoke the cigarette in front of them. However, data screening
revealed a bimodal distribution of latency (reaction time) to “first button push” data.
Therefore, a binary variable of smoking resistance was created with responses categorised as
either button pushed (smoked) or non-button pushed (abstained). This has now been
explained in the data analysis section on page 8.
4. Results – number of cigarettes smoked (p.10) – as noted above, it would be useful to know
over what time period this relates. It is quite possible that the effect of ICT wears off fairly
quickly so it may have an effect on same day smoking but not on smoking for the rest of the
week. Did the authors explore this?
The period for assessing cigarette use pre and post-training was 7 days. We have adjusted
the wording in the procedure section (pages 6-8) to make this clear. We agree that the effects
of training may not have been sufficient to impact cigarette smoking for 7 days. We do not
have data for smoking on the day of training, following the experimental session.
5. Results – smoking resistance (p.10): It would be useful to provide a contingency table here
showing how many people smoked or abstained. Did the authors consider using a linear
regression model to explore effects of ICT on time to smoke?
I have provided a table showing the number of participants who smoked and abstained in
each training group. As described above, data were bimodally distributed and therefore a
binary logistic analysis was conducted to analyse smoking resistance data.
Other changes:
We have also modified the statistics in the cigarette use analysis on page 10 as the previous
values reflected the analysis without the missing data coded for two participants.
We changed our data accessibility statement on page 14 to reflect that data are available on
request. These data are restricted as we do not have consent from participants for these data
to be made open.
