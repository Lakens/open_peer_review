The main contribution of this paper is the analysis of the UTXO sets of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and
Litecoin. Methods are introduced to evaluate if an output (of UTXO) is worth spending. In
general, the paper is readable and well organized. The paper presents a clear view and structure
of UTXO. The analysis indicates that the three cryptocurrencies require relative huge amount of
storage complexity in per transaction and height. The experiments in section 4 is quite
comprehensive. In Table 3, there are "?". The authors may further explain if those data could be
captured dynamically, during the execution of scripts. In figure 10, 11 and 12, there are some
"smooth" lines. The authors may further explain the reasons behind.

Dear Professor Herrera-Joancomartí,
I am pleased to inform you that your manuscript entitled "Another coin bites the dust: An
analysis of dust in UTXO based cryptocurrencies" is now accepted for publication in Royal
Society Open Science.
As described in our instructions to authors (https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-
guidelines/), we need the original source files of any figures and tables included with your
manuscript, as well as an editable version of your paper for our production processes. Before we

A zip folder containing all source files for your manuscript – including a text file of the
manuscript (tex, txt, rtf or doc), references, tables (including captions) and figure captions; an
electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred [either format should be
produced directly from original creation package], or original software format); an electronic file
of each table.
Please do NOT deposit your manuscript figure or table files in the Dryad repository

Comment: In Table 3, there are ”?”. The authors may further explain if those data could be captured
dynamically, during the execution of scripts.
Response:
ndeed, maybe the usage of the question mark symbol in the table could cause some confusion to readers.
For that reason we have changed such symbol with the notation var that probably better indicates the
variable nature of such parameter. The main idea that we want to show with this notation is that it is
not possible to determine the size of the input that will spend that kind of outputs. However, as the
eviewer points out, the moment the output is spent, we can observe the content of its scriptSig and,
herefore, compute its size. Yet whenever the output is spent, it is no longer an Unspend Transaction
Output (UTXO), and it is thus no longer the subject of our analysis. On the other hand, we can indeed
use historic data about outputs that have already been spent to estimate the input sizes of such var
value. This is actually what we do in Section 4.3, where we estimate the unknown sizes given the data
we can see in the blockchain, that is, the inputs that have already been revealed.
We have tried to better explain how do we deal with unkowns in input sizes in our study at the beggining
of Section 4.c.
Comment: In figure 10, 11 and 12, there are some ”smooth” lines. The authors may further explain
he reasons behind.
Response:
We have further explained in the paper the smooth lines showed in Figures 10, 11 and 12. We have
ncluded the following comments regarding each of the mentioned figures:
• Figure 10: Before block 158,214, all spent P2PKH outputs have uncompressed public keys in the
corresponding inputs, because this was the format being used by bitcoin clients at that time. Con-
sequently, the plot shows a smooth line on the low heights, denoting the constant 64-byte length of
public keys being used.
• Figure 11: From block ˜ 275,000 up until block ˜ 480,000, the average size of inputs is almost
constant, because 98.2% of them are 2-out-of-2 and 2-out-of-3 multisig scripts which are 216 and
250-byte long, respectively. However, after this period, P2WSH and P2WPKH scripts encapsulated
in P2SH inputs become popular, and because its size is smaller, the average P2SH input script size
decreases.
• Figure 12: From block ˜ 488,000 onwards, the plot shows an stable trend. 97% of the redeem scripts
are 252, 253 or 254 bytes long, and correspond to 2-of-3 multisignature scripts.
