label_comment_2
The author has added an extended discussion section that is very helpful and improves the paper
considerably. In particular, it includes the acknowledgement that the T^3 law for the heat
capacity of solids has indeed been well established in the case of metals. It also includes a
scholarly critique of the various assumptions that are involved in the standard analyses of the
thermal properties of materials, including the transition from the discrete the continuous regime,
the use of boundary conditions that may misrepresent the topology of a material, and more.
Despite these improvements the crucial question of how these various effects are relevant to the
theory proposed by the author (that the T^3 law for the heat capacity must be augmented with an
extra factor of temperature, to give rise to a T^4 law) has not been clarified. The present reviewer
cannot confirm the theoretical basis for the T^4 law and is uncertain whether the experimental
evidence presented has ruled out the applicability of the conventional T^3 law in the low
temperature limit even in the case of insulators.
I believe, however, that the author has raised interesting theoretical points and highlighted a
number of observations that may question our understanding of the thermal properties of certain
insulators at low temperatures. One possibility would be for the author to present his critique
alone leaving to a future paper a discussion of how the apparent anomalies in the
thermodynamic data can be accounted for in terms of a new theoretical description. I believe that
this future paper would have to make the case for the T^4 law for the heat capacity that can be
persuasive in terms of both analytical and physical arguments. In particular, the future paper
would need to explain both analytically and physically precisely which shortcoming of current
theory leads to an allegedly misleading T^3 law and how the correction of this shortcoming
yields an additional factor of T in the heat capacity. I encourage the author to develop further his
strikingly original ideas.

Appendix A
The author has put forward arguments to suggest that the traditional theory of 
the heat capacity of solids contains inconsistencies and leads to an erroneous T3 
temperature dependence at low temperatures. In terms of an unconventional 
field description the author suggests that the correct power law is T4 rather than 
T3 and he presents analyses of experimental data in a range of materials in 
support of his assertion. This challenges one of the best known and universally 
accepted theories in condensed matter physics that has been taught to students 
since the advent of quantum mechanics. 
A claim of this magnitude and fundamental nature is normally expected to be 
backed up by a range of compelling arguments and empirical findings. For the 
reasons given below this level of proof has not been reached. Despite this, 
however, the proposal is potentially so important that it should be made 
available to the scientific community in some form for deeper consideration. 
The manuscript puts forward many thought provoking ideas and is of very 
considerable interest whether or not the principle claim is strongly supported by 
the evidence presented. I recommend that this work in some form be considered 
for publication provided that the following points are satisfactorily addressed. 
1. Since the manuscript aims to convince the mainstream in condensed matter
physics, the arguments for the breakdown of the conventional theory for the
free energy of elementary excitations must be presented not only in terms of
a new and unfamiliar language, but also in terms of the established language
that is currently taught to students of physics. What precisely goes wrong
with the current statistical mechanical theory of vibrational modes of a
periodic lattice? It is not sufficient to simply state in general terms that the
standard theory does not adequately take into account the effects of topology,
i.e., the existence of finite boundaries. This is especially important given that
the characteristic wavelengths of the vibrational modes that are relevant in
the analyses of experimental data presented are much smaller than the
characteristic sample dimensions.
2. In the conventional description, the T3 law for the heat capacity can be
understood intuitively in terms of the dynamical exponent, z, of the
elementary excitations (<U+03C9>q <U+221D> qz) and the dimension, d, of phase space
available for such excitations, i.e., the heat capacity in leading order in
temperature varies as Td/z. For phonons in three dimensions, z=1 and d=3, so
that the heat capacity is expected to vary as T3. Within this language that is
widely understood, how can one justify intuitively the emergence of an extra
factor of T in the author’s new T4 law? If the goal is to convince the
mainstream reader then an argument entirely based on unfamiliar abstract
formalism is insufficient.
3. The heat capacity data analysed by the author can be fitted to a sum of a T3
and a T4 term at sufficiently low T (a sum of a T3 term and higher order terms
with odd powers of T has also been considered). Importantly, the coefficient
of the T3 term is found to be finite in essentially all cases. At first sight, the
latter is consistent with the conventional theory of solids, but is attributed by
the author to a contribution from the surface of the sample. This is a major 
claim that must be supported in a convincing manner. Minimally, the author 
should show that the observed T3 component is of the form and order of 
magnitude expected for a surface contribution. It seems more likely to this 
reviewer that the order of magnitude of the coefficient of the T3 term will be 
found to be consistent with the traditional theory of elementary excitations 
that depends essentially on the independently measureable velocity of sound. 
The author needs to show convincingly that this is not the case and that the 
origin of the T3 is indeed unconventional. 
4. The author emphasises that plots of heat capacity divided by T3 show an
initial upturn, starting from a finite T-­->0 intercept, followed necessarily by a
peak, known as the “phonon peak”, vs. temperature. This is indeed
inconsistent with the prediction of the Debye model in its conventional form.
However, the issue is whether it is inconsistent with the more general,
though still conventional, statistical mechanical theory of elementary
excitations, if the experimentally observed dispersion relations for lattice
vibrations are included. For example, we expect the correction to the linear
dispersion for phonons to be negative and this by itself would tend to
produce a “phonon peak”. It is possible that the “phonon peak” calculated in
this way would be far too weak to account for the observed anomaly. In this
case there would indeed be a problem with our conventional description that
requires further investigation and the consideration of potentially new ideas.
This reviewer is intrigued by the author’s originality and many thoughtful 
comments and believes that there is a form of the manuscript (taking into 
account the above comments) that should be made available for the 
consideration of the more thoughtful and open-­-minded members of the wider 
scientific community.

in response to the Reviewers' Comments I substantially revised the paper. I removed
four references [61-64] and the accompanying text as unessential and added 35 new
ones that are used in Discussion. The manuscript has enlarged from 32 to 43 pages.
I have tried to keep changes to the main text minimal, because the Comments were
mostly addressed to the criticism of other theories dealt in Discussion. Thus, only one
equation was added to Sect. 1, Eq. 2, with no further changes. However, Discussion
was completely redone and expanded. Now it is preceded by Conclusion, where some
clarifying comments about the proposed theory are given.
Discussion now has seven subsections. Two of them contain the extended critique of
the Debye theory and the Born-von Karman theory. I hope these two subsections and
subsection F fully replies to the Reviewers' Comments 1 and 2. Comment 2 is not
explicitly addressed but it is not a theory, but rather a common convention used for
qualitative analysis. I hope Discussion explains now why this common convention, in
this or other forms, may not be correct.
I have to admit that this is hardly possible to give the full explanations in one paper,
which was meant to be a special case study. As can be seen from the paper and
Discussion, the presented field theory of specific heat itself is only one application of
the more general formalism of the thermodynamics of media, which is still in progress.
I pan to communicate this progress in further publications.
In regards to Comment 3, I removed any comments about the finite-size effects in
specific heat, because they are not relevant to the main content, and because a
separate work on this subject is in preparation. The rest of this reply is in subsection F.
In regards to Comment 4, I think that the right theory should have predicted the
'phonon peak' instead of describing it by additional modifications. In fact, I had no idea
about such phenomenon and the diverse experimental and theoretical studies of the
'boson peak' before it had emerged from my mathematical derivations. This clear
prediction is an indication that the proposed axiomatic approach is working. However, it
is possible that a modified phonon theory could describe it, post factum.
Best regards, Yuri Gusev.

Title: The quasi-low temperature behaviour of specific heat
Authors: Yuri V. Gusev
Report
Earlier theoretical work by the author concerning a field theory is applied to describe
the behaviour of the specific heat capacity C of crystalline and glassy solids in the so-
called quasi-low temperature region. The field theory uses dimensionless thermal
variables, based on the interatomic distance and the sound velocities, and provides a
T4-behaviour of specific heat over the quasi-low temperature region, which is
localized below a characteristic temperature T0. T0 depends on the physical
characteristics of the material and roughly corresponds to the peak temperature of the
hump observed in a C/T3 representation for both crystals and glasses. In the latter
solids, it is also identified as the temperature of the calorimetric Boson peak (BP)
arising from the same excess low-energy vibrations causing the BP observed in
Raman spectra below 100 cm-1. The analysis includes assessment of the quartic
power law for the specific heat over the quasi-low temperature region in some
crystals and glasses, this observation leading the author to claim the universality of
this behaviour for all the solids.
This is an interesting theoretical approach on a complex argument such as the
deviations of the low-temperature thermal properties of solids from the Debye
predictions, and deserves publication. But the paper first needs major revision.
The English text is sometimes obscure and some revision in several places is
required. Also, there are a number of typos in the text: e.g., page 10-line 3, “axises”
should be “axes”; page 12-line 43: “lead” should be “leads”, etc.
The author is also kindly encouraged to improve the quality of Figures 1-12 drawing
the axes on the top and the right, also including the title of plotted functions on y-
axes (not only on captions).
BASIC THEME.
1. The use of definition (1) assumes the constancy of the ratio between the sound
velocity Vs and the average interatomic distance a: usually in crystals, but also
in glasses, the sound velocity decreases with increasing temperature, while the
thermal expansion increases. This means that the ratio Vs/a will hardly remain
constant. This hypothesis appears to be quite speculative, unless the variation
of this ratio over the quasi-low temperature range considered is so small than
it can be neglected. Please motivate this conjecture more convincingly.
2. Figures should be reported and discussed in progressive order. At page 10,
Figure 8 is referred before Figure 4 and at page 11, Figure 7 is referred
before Figures 5 and 6. The author is kindly encouraged to present his
description more neatly.
3. At page 11, lines 9-10, it is reported that “this hump was dubbed in the
glass matter literature “ the Boson peak” [24]…”
The hump in C/T3 observed in crystalline solids is probably due to some van
Hove’s singularity in the true lattice spectrum which, of course, is quite
different from the Debye spectrum which should hold near <U+F06E>=0, when the
material behaves as an elastic continuum. In principle, it does not correspond
to the Raman or calorimetric Boson peak, observed in glasses. At present,
there is a wide debate about this argument: the BP observed in glasses could
be due to a van Hove’s singularity, also present in the corresponding crystal,
which is shifted to lower frequency/temperature by the softening of the
structure (see your Ref. 85, Chumakov at al, PRL112,025502 (2014)).
Alternatively, the BP could arise from localized soft vibrations of glassy
units, missing in the crystal (e.g., see Carini et al, PRL 111, 245502 (2013)).
The latter paper also reports the temperature behaviour of specific heat
between 1.5 and 30 K (the quasi-low temperature region) in crystalline
trigonal B2O3, showing that it follows strictly a T3-behaviour in very close
connection with Debye predictions. The author is kindly encouraged to
comment on this in the context of his interesting proposal and also to discuss
more exhaustively the debate about the possible origin of the hump in C/T3 in
crystals and glasses.
4. page 18, the sentence is not clear because the comparison between C/T3 of
glassy and crystalline forms has been performed only for PdCuP compound.
Quite differently, only the heat capacity of crystalline Cu and Zn were
analysed, simply because these elemental metals do not exist in glassy form.
5. page 19, lines 55-56, the first authors who discovered the collapse in a single
master curve of C/Cpeak vs T/Tpeak for a number of glasses were Liu and
Lohneisen, PRB 48, 13486 (1993).
6. page 21, authors of Ref. 45 report an experimental investigation of terahertz
time-domain spectroscopy, low-frequency Raman scattering, and Brillouin
light scattering on glassy glucose stating that the BP is an universal feature of
“glassy” condensed matter, and not of all the condensed matter, as reported at
page 21, line 51!
RECOMMENDATION. The author should be invited to resubmit, after making the
revisions suggested.
Appendix D
Reply to Comment 3 of Referee 2.
An apparent example of the third power law of specific heat in experimental data [1] was
suggested by an anonymous referee. The diboron trioxide B2 O3 was fused and placed under
pressure 4 GPa. After the quenching (rapid cooling) from 1280<U+25E6> C to the room temperature
the material was verified by the x-ray diffraction as a polycrystalline sample of the trigonal
crystalline a-B2 O3 . The measurements of Ref. [1] report, in the graphic form of Cm /T 3 vs T
in Fig. 2(b), an almost perfect cubic power law - a straight horizontal line. Unfortunately,
the authors did not publish the data used to plot this graph. Without published data, this
experimental fact cannot be confirmed and studied.
It is difficult to make a good comparison with other measurements on the crystalline
diboron trioxide, because the only data on the crystalline B2 O3 specific heat in the literature
is Ref. [3]. Ref. [1] refers to the earlier work [2] and claims using its data in Fig. 2(a).
Regretfully, Ref. 15 of [1] is wrong, the cited work [2] was authored by K. K. Kelley, not by
authors listed in Ref. 15. Furthermore, Ref. [2] presents data only above 51 K, that could
not be useful for the purpose of [1].
However, the listed in Ref. 15 of [1] authors published the work [3] (still used in reference
books), whose dataset spans temperatures from 18 to 297 K. Apparently, these data were
used in Fig. 2(a) of [1]. The data of [3] are too noisy below 40 K to perform a statistical
analysis. Nevertheless, the graph Cm /T 3 vs T of these data, Fig. 1, displays the right
descending branch and an apparently convex top in the range 18-30 K, where the crystalline
B2 O3 characteristic temperature T0 could possibly be. In Fig. 1 we used the units used in
[1] (per gram instead of per mole) for easier comparison. One can see that the crystalline
B2 O3 specific heat seems to exhibit the usual ’anomalous’ behaviour, characteristic of the
T 4 power law, in the QLT regime. The authors of [1] did plot the data of [3] (by ’stars’) in
Fig. 2(a) because on the log-log scale used in that figure (we insist that this kind of plot
is misleading and useless for quantitative analysis) these data seem to continue the T 3 line
of the data, which they obtained for the quenched crystalline B2 O3 . However, they did not
use the data of [3] in Fig 2(b), Cm /T 3 vs T , perhaps, because in this kind of graph these
data would not support the claimed T 3 behaviour.
The highest value of Cm /T 3 with data from [3] is 0.81 µJ/(g · K4). This means that if the
data plotted in Fig. 1 were plotted together with other data in Fig. 2(b), the corresponding
graph would indeed join the curve for the polycrystalline B2 O3 in Fig. 2(b), which is located
1
FIG. 1: Cm /T 3 vs T for crystalline B2 O3 [3] (in units of 10-6 J K -4 g -1 )
at around this height. However, it is apparent that this curve in Fig. 2(b) shows somewhat
higher values for higher temperature, which is contradictory to the Debye cubic law. We
think, that the true shape of the graph could be similar to Fig. 1, however, as is well know
and clear from the data of [3] and the figure from [1], the height of the ’anomalous’ hump
of the graph Cm /T 3 vs T for crystalline matter is much lower and its peak’s temperature is
higher than these properties for glassy matter. Therefore, when plotted together with glassy
matter graphs, the ’boson peak’ of the crystalline B2 O3 is almost distinguishable. This
’boson peak’ could still be detectable by the tools of statistical analysis, if the experimental
data were available.
There are two other similar experimental studies of densified glasses, germanium dioxide
GeO2 [4] and vitreous silica SiO2 [5], by the same experimental team. Unfortunately, both
studies lack the measurements for a quenched polycrystalline form of the studied compounds.
We hope this experimental group would complete its work by producing such samples and
measuring the specific heat of the quenched under pressure polycrystals in order to verify
and study the cubic power law reported in [1].
These future measurements with tetragonal crystalline germanium dioxide could be com-
2
pared with the only data source, Ref. [6], which gives the specific heat of GeO2 for T > 16K.
These data allow us to find the quasi-low temperature threshold at T0 ˜ 55 K, see Fig. 2.
The temperature of the ’boson peak’ for the glassy GeO2 can be estimated from Fig. 1
FIG. 2: Cm /T 3 vs T for crystalline GeO2 [6] (in units of 10-5 J K -4 mol-1 )
(b) of [4] as 8 K the normal glass and higher for densified ones. Therefore, the data [6] lie
outside the region of interest of Ref. [4]. Nevertheless, the data of [6] show that properties
of glassy matter are qualitatively similar to the ones of crystalline matter. The remarkable
fact about the data of [6] is a very high temperature of the QLT threshold, 55 K, the only
material with a higher T0 we know of is diamond.
We could not find published data of the specific heat of crystalline silica (a or ß forms of
quartz) for the low temperature range considered here (high temperature data, T > 100 K
can be found in [7], p.1755). Some ’smoothed’ data taken from other references are published
in [8]. The specific heat data reported in Fig. 4 of [10] and Fig. 3 (as a part of the combined
plot) of [8] were obtained by E.F. Westrum Jr. and apparently published in his Cornell
University thesis and [9], the references we could not obtain. Nevertheless, the Cm /T 3 vs T
graph of the data from [8] has a shape characteristic to Fig. 2, with the estimated T0 ˜ 22 K.
Fig. 1(a) of Ref. [5] contains the graph Cm /T 3 vs T for crystalline silica, but it does not
3
cite the original source of data and refers instead to [10], which contains no data of specific
heat. This fact gives grounds for the conjecture, that the authors of [5] did not plot the
corresponding curve, but copied it from the figures of [10]. Indeed, this curve in Fig. 1(a)
is plotted as a line in contrast to other graphs plotted by points.
Summarising, the authors of experimental studies [1, 4, 5] believed in the Debye cubic
law, thus, they did not check properly the thermal properties of the studied compounds in
crystalline form. If they would not follow the mirage of the Debye model, the conclusions of
their works could be different. It could be beneficial for the physics community to see the
datasets of [1, 4, 5] released into public domain. New low temperature measurements for
crystalline B2 O3 , SiO2 and GeO2 should be done to improve the reference books.

Title: The quasi-low temperature behaviour of specific heat
Authors: Yuri V. Gusev
Second Report
The first draft of this paper required significant revision, as I emphasized in my
constructive criticism. As far as I can see, most of the points have been clarified in the
revised text in a satisfactory way and the present version of the manuscript is now
written with an acceptable discussion. This is an interesting theoretical approach
concerning the low-temperature thermal properties of solids and could deserve
publication, but the paper first needs a further important revision.
The English text continues to be sometimes obscure and there are typos in the text:
e.g., page 6-first line, “vitrious” should be “vitreous”; page 6-fourth line, “It fact”
should be “In fact”; page 19-line 27: “behavour” should be “behaviour”, etc.
BASIC THEME.
1. First of all, I believe that there is no sense to include the extended comment by
the author as a separate appendix entitled “Reply to Comment 3 of Referee 2”.
After the requested and necessary revision, the author is strongly encouraged
to include his comments about experimental observations of T3-behaviour in
some crystals in Section V-Discussion, subsection E “The cubic law in the
specific heat experimental data”.
2. I have a serious criticism on the analysis carried out on the results by Carini et
al, PRL111, 245502 (2013), because it mainly highlights some meaningless
details:
(i) it is well known that the T3-behaviour provided by the Debye theory is
usually expected for temperatures T<U+F0A3><U+F071>D/50, in order to take the upper
limit <U+F071>D/T of the integral defining the specific heat, as large as possible
(approximating infinite). This means that the observation of T3-
behaviour for c-B2O3 (trigonal, <U+F071>D=621 K), c-SiO2 (quartz, <U+F071>D=550 K )
and c-GeO2 (hexagonal, <U+F071>D=365 K and tetragonal, <U+F071>D=476 K) is
expected below about 11-12 K. Most <U+F071>D are calorimetric, except that of
quartz which is elastic, i.e. evaluated by the sound velocities. This
means that for all these crystalline oxides a T3-behaviour is expected at
temperatures below about 10 K, as experimentally observed.
(ii) The T3-behaviour observed by Carini et al is not apparent, but real!
Those authors emphasize correctly in caption of Fig. 2(a), “The dotted
line represents a fit to the data between 2 and 8 K of c-B2O3, which
gives a T3.04 behavior”. As also reported in the same paper, the high
temperature data of c-B2O3 by Kerr et al (author names correct, but
journal citation wrong) have been included in the same figure, just to
remark that the two different sets of experimental data are in close
agreement. Surely, they were not used to prove a T3-behaviour over a
so large interval of temperatures, because this would have been
meaningless (see above). Probably, this is the only reason why Kerr's
data have not been reported in Fig. 2b. T3-behaviours can be also clearly
observed below about 12 K in tetragonal GeO2, see the paper by
Westrum and coworkers, JNCS 315, 20 (2003), and also in the
hexagonal polymorph below 10 K, even if the data are really very noisy
in the latter case. The same paper includes also low temperature specific
heat data of c-B2O3 (trigonal), by Kerr et al., and of different
polymorphs of c-SiO2, showing that a T3-behaviour can be observed
below 5 K in quartz.
(iii) Concerning the availability of specific heat data to be used for a
statistical analysis of the observed behaviors, I like to inform the author
that, from many years, a number of application software are available,
also on Internet and free of charge, which allow to take experimental
data directly from the figures with very high accuracy; as an example,
OriginPro 8 is one of these even if it is not free of charge. This means
that it is not necessary, today, to have numeric values of experimental
data reported on the manuscript.
Concluding, I believe that the present comments by the author about the
experimentally observed T3-behaviour on c-B2O3 are quite specious and not
objective in an attempt to support the possible existence of the quasi-low
temperature region. They are not convincing and, above all, do not clarify the
question concerning his proposal (the quasi-low temperature region) and the
experimental observations in crystalline solids (including also c-GeO2 and to a
less extent c-SiO2), which appear to follow a T3-behaviour for T<U+F0A3><U+F071>D/50. The
author is again requested to discuss this argument more exhaustively, avoiding
sterile and sometimes groundless polemics.
RECOMMENDATION. The author should be invited to resubmit, after making the
suggested change.
Appendix F
I thank Referee 2 for indicating the regretful misprints, introduced by numerous revisions of the
manuscript. Apparently Referee 2 does not have new majour comments on the manuscript itself.
The report of Referee 2 is devoted not to my paper, but to my reply to his previous comments. One
of the comments prompted me to write in TeX a larger letter, entitled “Reply to Comment 3 of
Referee 2”, which included the analysis of several publications and a separate list of references. As I
wrote before, the paper, Carini et al, PRL111, 245502 (2013), suggested by Referee 2 in the previous
report, does not have experimental data, therefore, I do not think it is possible to do rigorous
scientific analysis of the results of that paper. Therefore I do not discuss this paper in my manuscript.
Let me make this clear, I wrote a long letter to the referee, not an appendix to the paper. This reply
was submitted to RSOS as a separate PDF file, and no TeX file was submitted. The computer system
of RSOS joined two files, my manuscript and the letter to Referee 2, which is not a part of the paper,
into one PDF file. This may be confusing for referees. Perhaps, the RSOS management should
address this issue in future. However, my reply is indeed incorporated into the preprint version of
the paper on arxiv.org as an appendix. But that preprint is not a publication and it was not submitted
to the journal. Furthermore, I am willing to remove the appendix and resubmit the arxiv preprint in a
final version, if the paper is accepted by the journal.
As a personal remark to Comment 2, which is not related to my paper, I add that the claimed
behaviour of the cubic power of temperature must be proven by specifying: 1) what was analysed,
raw data or the derived quantity, i.e. the log-log function, 2) the number and the range of data
points that were statistically analysed, 3) standard deviations, 4) the values of statistical significance.
It is especially important to understand that the use of log-log plots for scientific analysis is
misleading, as it caused false conclusions in different scientific fields.
I would also like to reply to Comment 3 on my concern about placing the experimental data into
public domain. The journal I submitted the manuscript to, Royal Society Open Science, has an official
policy of requesting authors to put all data sets into the designated depository Dryad. Thus, Royal
Society also supports this idea, which makes science more transparent and meaningful. In regards to
the software that could extract data from the figures, I do not think it can replace raw data. First,
plotting graphs introduces new uncertainties in addition to experimental ones. Extracting data from
the figures adds more uncertainties. But the worst thing is that most publications do not display raw
data, they plot some derived, often complicated, functions based on the data. Sometimes, this is
done on log-log or semi-log plots, then, it is really impossible to get any usable data, even by special
software.
Appendix G
Third Referee report
Journal: Royal Society Open Science
Article ID: RSOS-171285.R3
Title: The quasi-low temperature behaviour of specific heat
Authors: Yuri V. Gusev
Third Report
The explanation given by the author about his extended reply to Comment 3 of
Referee 2, i.e. it was to be considered just as his personal interpretation of the results
reported in various papers by Carini and colleagues and not as an appendix of the
manuscript, is convincing. Now, I believe that the present version of the paper is
acceptable for publication.
I like to stress “his personal interpretation” because I do not agree with the author
about the essential availability of raw experimental data to carry out a rigorous
scientific analysis. The experimental data points usually reported in the figures of most
papers concerning the specific heat capacity of condensed systems are more than
adequate for a rigorous analysis, mostly when reported in linear scales. As emphasized
in my previous report, there are a number of software programs which allow to extract
experimental data directly from the figures with very high accuracy and really
negligible uncertainties, mainly when the data are reported in linear scales. As a very
limited example, this is the case of the papers by Carini et al (Fig. 2b of PRL111,
245502 (2013) and Fig. 1b of Phil Mag 96, 761 (2016)) and by Richet, de Ligny and
Westrum (Fig.1 of JNCS 315, 20 (2003)), where the temperature behaviours of C/T3
vs T are reported in linear scale. The data points reported in these figures are
unquestionably the raw experimental data because random and systematic errors of
the order of few percent are clearly visible. Surely, they are not the result of some
polynomial fit used to improve and make more attractive the temperature behaviours
of measured specific heat capacities.
Finally, as emphasized in my previous report, I remind to the author that the T3-
behaviour provided by the Debye theory is usually expected for temperatures
T<U+F0A3><U+F071>D/50, i.e. for temperatures lower than about 10 K in almost all the solids
investigated. It has been clearly observed (in addition to the linear electronic
contribution) not only in elemental crystalline metals, but also in a wide number of
insulating crystals, such as c-Ge, c-KCl, c-Se, c-SiO2 (quartz), crystalline
Polyethylene (Figs. 3.2 and 3.3 of the paper by Robert Pohl, in Low Temperature
Specific Heat of Glasses in Amorphous Solids: Low-Temperature properties, ed. by
W. A. Phillips, Springer, Berlin 1981, pp 27-52), c-GeO2 (tetragonal, Fig. 3.17 of the
same paper by Pohl and Fig.1 of the paper by Westrum), c-B2O3 (trigonal, Fig. 2b of
the paper by Carini et al). In all these cases, the T4-behaviour provided by your quasi-
low temperature model concerns the temperature region above few Kelvin where a
peak is observed in a C/T3 representation of the specific heat capacity. The peak arises
from the fact that the real frequency spectrum in the atomic lattice is very different
from g(<U+F06E>)<U+F0B5><U+F06E>2 assumed by Debye and can be attributed to a peak in the phonon density
of states due to an unusually <U+FB02>at dispersion relation of the lowest transverse acoustic
mode near the Brillouin-zone boundary. The only exception is crystalline
polyethylene, which strictly follows the Debye behaviour without any peak, see the
paper by Pohl, Fig.3.3.
