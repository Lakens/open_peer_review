In the MS entitled: ‘Context-dependent female mate choice maintains variation in male sexual
activity’ Carolin Sommer-Trembo and coll. tested whether female prefer males with intermediate
male sexual activity in a series of two-choice tests in which female eastern mosquitofish could
choose between two male animations, one in which male showed no sexual activity (control) and
one in which the male showed a low, intermediate and high level of sexual activity. Females with
different degree of previous sexual experience, and in isolation vs. in a group, were tested. The
results suggest that
i) Experienced females avoid males with very high sexual activity, prefer males with
intermediate sexual activity, whereas they do not show any preference between sexually inactive
males and males with low sexual activity.
ii) Experience females in a shoal do not avoid males with high sexual activity, whereas the
preference for the other two types of males remains substantially unchanged.
iii) Virgin females (inexperienced) did not discriminate between controls and any of the
three types of males.
The manuscript is very well written, data presented clearly and properly discussed. I have
enjoyed reading it. I think it represents a nice contribution because, although female choice
studies are numerous, it is quite rare that more than two options are given to females, reducing
the possibility to detect non-linear mate preference functions. As such this is a nice contribution
to the field.
There are some points that need attention, though, before firm conclusions can be reached. I listed
my points below:
1) Measure of proximity preference: Preference is expressed as the proportion of time near
the active male stimulus over the total time in the choice zones. This is OK, but it is necessary to
know how much time on average (and the range of variation) females spent near the screens.
Virgin females should be more attracted by males than gravid, sexually receptive females (as
those used in the ‘experienced’ groups), thus it may be worth comparing the absolute time spent
in proximity of the screens in the three groups (see also my next point).
2) Proximity to the screens as a measure of mating preference: It is necessary to support the
assumption that female proximity reflects a sexual interest towards the male video stimulus.
Alternatively, females may be just attracted by the fact that they see ‘more movement’ on the
screen, rather than by sexual motivation towards the male animation. Note that the results may
be explained by non sexual interest towards the video stimuli and this interest may vary with
experience and the presence of a same-sex shoal.
3) Virgin females in a shoal: It is not explained why inexperienced females were not tested
also in a shoal.
4) Choice of the sexual activity in the video playbacks: according to the data presented in
the supplementary data, only one male out of 18 performed more than 3 mating attempts per
min, and he did on average just slightly more than 3 attempts per min. This value (3) was instead
the mating rate chosen for the intermediate male, and the high rate was 6 mating attempts per
min. The authors justify this choice because ‘By sharing their attention between both animations,
focal females were likely to underestimate the sexual activity of the animation showing a sexually
active male’. This explanation is a bit weak, as it would apply to any two-choice test, even if
based on live stimuli. I think that there are published data on sexual activity of eastern
mosquitofish and that should be provided to support this choice. It is clearly important to
provide evidence that the sexual activity range used in this study reflects natural range of
variation to conclude that there is selection for intermediate sexual activity.
3
5) Denominator degrees of freedom (line 191-2): in a LMM the ddf should be similar to the
number of subjects (n=48) and not to the number of observations, otherwise the results become
unduly permissive. Since your experimental design is balanced, I would suggest to use a
‘standard’ GLM, in which female identity is entered as random factor (SPSS provides this
routine) and that will provide unbiased ddf. You also need to arcsine transform proportions prior
to analysis.

In this study the authors investigated whether females preferred sexually high active, medium or
less active males in Gambusia holbrooki. They tested females experienced in mate choice alone or
presented three additional familiar females during mate choice. Additionally, they tested virgin
female to see whether experience might explain different mate preferences. Instead using live
stimulus males in a binary choice situation they used virtual stimulus males and females, thus
they could standardize male sexual activity. They provide videos with males showing low,
medeium or high sexual activity to a virtual female stimulus.
In the supplementary materials authors provided information how they measure and categorized
sexual activity in males in a different population of Gambusia holbrooki. Here they observed a
single male together with three unfamiliar females and measured approaches of the male to a
female „in the blind portion of her visual field“, nipping a t the females genital pore, and
gonopodial thrusts for 10 min. Whereas nipping and number of gonopodial thrusts is easy to
observe and to quantify, I think it is not easy to measure and quantify the approaches of a male to
a female because there were three females around and males often switch from approaching one
female to another female.
In a separate experiment they measured the distance a male is swimming alone through a tank.
The authors hypothesized that males show a consistent pattern in sexual activity when tested
same male on three different days and that this sexual activity is positive correlated to swimming
4
activity. They stated „Here we provide additional data demonstrating pronounced individual
variation, coupled high behavioral consistency, in male sexual activity of our study species.“
There was, however, only a very narrow range regarding the sexual activity of tested males
(mean: – 3.4/ min). When considering Fig. S1 it seems that most of the 18 males
changed their sexual activity in the course of the three days and that the variation within males is
higher than variation between males. This is in contrast to a consistent individual pattern in
males regarding sexual activity. Swimming activity was not correlated to sexual activity.
The result of the main study was that females experienced in mate choice avoided highly sexual
active males and preferred medium active males. When females were accompanied by three
other females the preferred medium active males but chose low and high active males randomly.
The authors, however, stated that „Notably, female [with three other females] responses to males
with high sexual activity were significantly different from those observed when females were
tested without a shoal present. There is, however, no evidence for this statement. Females
accompanied with other females chose highly active males at random. I also do not follow the
authors when stating „..G. holbrooki males show pronounced and consistent individual variation
in sexual activity“ (line 211).
Sexually inexperienced females showed neither preference nor avoidance regarding sexual active
males. Thus, these females might be a vector for the maintenance of different levels of sexual
activity in males.
I am missing a control. When presenting the group of females to focal females it might be that
focal females spent more time within the neutral zone near their conspecifics than females tested
alone. The group of females might, therefore, lead to a decrease in the amount of time spending
in both preference zones. Authors should either show that there was no decrease in time spent or
they should test Gambusia females accompanied with three females of similar size of another
poeciliid species.

Associate Editor's comments:
Comments to the Author:
My primary concerns (in addition to those provided by the reviewers) are:
1. The study presented in the Supplementary Material was conducted on an invasive population
from Italy, while the main manuscript presents data on a population native to Florida. Can the
authors justify using data from the Italy population to inform the present study? This is especially
true given that the behavioral repertoire of both males and females in invasive populations might
be quite different from those that occupy the native range.
2. Reference to the supplementary material needs to be cleaned up quite a bit. For example, I did
not see Supplementary video S6 [line 160] or Supplementary material S5 [Lines 177-178]
3. In several places within the manuscript, the authors describe the control video (e.g., Line 117,
Lines 164-165) but it is not 100% clear that the control male video also had the female (as shown
in the supplementary video). The authors should clarify that the female was present (if it was) but
the male just didn't exhibit any nipping. If the female was not present on the control video, the
authors would need to justify why because it would open up numerous alternative explanations
for the results.
Minor comments:
Line 22: Delete "indeed"
Line 45: Delete "which assumes"
Line 54: Change to "...we predicted that females would show..."
Line 83: Where in Florida? Is there a particular GPS locality or site description?
Lines 90-91: Once the gonopodium has developed, aren't the males sexually mature? This needs
to be clarified.
Line 108: This is a bit confusing because the authors stated that sexually mature males were
separated from the females. So, the conditions would be quite similar, no?
* General comment: The authors need to justify why they did not include a treatment where adult
virgin females were tested with a shoal. The ideal design would be full factorial so that you
could examine the interaction between sexual experience and shoal presence.
Line 127: Change "acclimatisation" to "acclimation" (see also Supplementary Material and change
there too).
7
Line 130: Change "chose" to "choose"
Line 134: "habituation" is not the appropriate term here; acclimation?
Line 136: If females were transferred back to the original stock tank, how did you ensure that the
females were not used multiple times (i.e., pseudoreplication)? This needs to be addressed
explicitly.
Line 170: Was the LMM run assuming a Gaussian distribution? If not, what sort of distribution
was used? If so, were the proportion data normally distributed; that is, would another
distribution be more appropriate for this analysis?
Line 236: Insert "are" between "sexual activity" and "dependent"

Associate Editor's comments:
Comments to the Author:
My primary concerns (in addition to those provided by the reviewers) are:
1. The study presented in the Supplementary Material was conducted on an invasive
population from Italy, while the main manuscript presents data on a population native to
Florida. Can the authors justify using data from the Italy population to inform the present
study? This is especially true given that the behavioral repertoire of both males and females in
nvasive populations might be quite different from those that occupy the native range.
t was originally planned to exclusively use individuals from the Florida population but due to
constraints in numbers of fish available from our stocks, we decided to use additional fish
rom the Italian population in order to avoid reusing the same individuals in different tests.
The editor is correct that we cannot exclude potential differences in the behavioural
epertoires of the two populations. However, we believe it is unlikely that populations differ
n basic sexual/mating behaviours—just because mating behaviour per se should be under
strong directional selection in any population. Most importantly, should the invasive
population have lower genetic variation (Grapputo et al. 2006, Italian Journal of Zoology, 73:
67-73), this would only have led to an underestimation of among-individual variation and
hus, behavioural consistency. The fact that we still uncovered pronounced among-individual
differences is actually an argument in favour of the point we are making with the data
presented in the supplement. We included this information to the supplementary material (S1,
ines 113-119).
Furthermore, all individuals used in the present study were born and reared in the laboratory
under nearly identical conditions, thereby avoiding potential differences in behaviour arising
rom exposure to different ecological backgrounds.
2. Reference to the supplementary material needs to be cleaned up quite a bit. For example, I
did not see Supplementary video S6 [line 160] or Supplementary material S5 [Lines 177-178]
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We cleaned up the references and made sure that
all information is now provided.
3. In several places within the manuscript, the authors describe the control video (e.g., Line
117, Lines 164-165) but it is not 100% clear that the control male video also had the female
as shown in the supplementary video). The authors should clarify that the female was present
if it was) but the male just didn't exhibit any nipping. If the female was not present on the
control video, the authors would need to justify why because it would open up numerous
alternative explanations for the results.
We thank the editor for this important comment. In the control video, the female was indeed
present but the male showed no nipping behaviour. We now clarified this point:
“In each test run, we presented one of three types of animations (each of them showing a
different nipping frequency) on one monitor, while another monitor presented the same
animation pair without any sexual behaviour (control).” (lines 120-122)
“We used the same male and female photos for control animations, in which they were shown
swimming horizontally from one side of the screen to the other and back without any sexual
behaviour. Hence, each focal female saw the same male phenotype in the control and sexual
activity animations, differing only in the frequency of animated sexual behaviour.” (lines 175-
179)
Minor comments:
Line 22: Delete "indeed"
Changed accordingly.
Line 45: Delete "which assumes"
Changed accordingly.
Line 54: Change to "...we predicted that females would show..."
Changed accordingly.
Line 83: Where in Florida? Is there a particular GPS locality or site description?
This population was imported by an aquarium fish company with no detailed information on
he exact origin of fish. Molecular investigations of several natural and invasive Gambusia
holbrooki populations (including the one used in the current study) based on nuclear
microsatellites (see Riesch R, Tobler M, Lerp H, Jourdan J, Doumas T, Nosil P, Langerhans RB, Plath M (2016)
Extremophile Poeciliidae: multivariate insights into the complexity of speciation along replicated ecological gradients. BMC
Evolutionary Biology E16:136) confirm Florida as the most probable origin of our test fish (Riesch et
al., unpublished data).
Lines 90-91: Once the gonopodium has developed, aren't the males sexually mature? This
needs to be clarified.
We thank the editor for this valuable comment. We now added a new section in the
supplemental material (S2 “Separation of premature males and females”) in which we
describe the process of the development of the male gonopodium and how we separated males
rom females before copulations could take place:
“To obtain virgin (sexually naïve) females, it was crucial to separate males from females
before they reached sexual maturity. Poeciliid fishes have internal fertilization, for which
males insert their gonopodium—a modified anal fin through which sperm bundles are being
ransferred—into the female’s gonopore [40].
The metamorphosis of the gonopodium takes several weeks and in the related G.
affinis is usually completed by the age of 120-180 days [41]. During metamorphosis, anal fin
rays 3, 4, and 5 are elongated by addition of segments until they become more than twice as
ong as the other anal fin rays. At the same time, anal fin ray 3 becomes thicker by the
addition of new bone material [41,42]. Sex differences in anal fin morphology become visible
early (for more details see [41]), which allowed us to separate males from females before
heir gonopodium reached a stage in which copulations became possible.” (Supplemental
material S2; lines 122-132)
Line 108: This is a bit confusing because the authors stated that sexually mature males were
separated from the females. So, the conditions would be quite similar, no?
Most of the females were derived from mixed-sex stock tanks. Only to obtain virgin females,
we used additional tanks and separated males from females.
“We used fish of a laboratory stock (maintained in our laboratory since 2013) originating
rom fish collected in Florida. Fish were maintained in mixed-sex stock tanks (200 l, except
virgin females, see below)…” (lines 83-85)
“To obtain virgin females, we raised offspring in separate tanks under conditions as
described above. Males were identified by their developing gonopodium [32] and were
separated from females before reaching sexual maturity.” (Supplemental material S2).” (lines
90-92)
* General comment: The authors need to justify why they did not include a treatment where
adult virgin females were tested with a shoal. The ideal design would be full factorial so that
you could examine the interaction between sexual experience and shoal presence.
The main question of our study was whether female G. holbrooki use male sexual activity as a
mate choice criterion. From this main question, we derived two further questions: (1) will the
observed preference (function) change when the social environment changes, i.e., when the
net costs of associating with highly sexually active males change? (2) Will the observed
pattern of mate choice change when testing females without prior sexual experience (i.e.
emales that never experienced male sexual harassment)?
To additionally test virgin females in a female group would open a totally new research
question, namely whether perceived protection in a shoal is learned or innate. Although this is
ndeed another interesting question, it was not the aim of the present study to answer it.
Given the results of our tests using virgin females, which showed no preference for any of the
male behavioural phenotypes, we would not expect that additional conclusions could be
derived from testing virgins in a group.
Line 127: Change "acclimatisation" to "acclimation" (see also Supplementary Material and
change there too).
We corrected this throughout our manuscript and in the supplementary material.
Line 130: Change "chose" to "choose"
Changed accordingly.
Line 134: "habituation" is not the appropriate term here; acclimation?
We now use the term “acclimation”.
Line 136: If females were transferred back to the original stock tank, how did you ensure that
he females were not used multiple times (i.e., pseudoreplication)? This needs to be addressed
explicitly.
Females passed through all three mate-choice tests in a row (random order) before they were
eturned to the original mixed-sex stock tanks. Females that were not yet tested remained in
he pre-testing maintenance tanks as to avoid pseudoreplication.
We clarified the respective sentence in the methods section and tidied up labels for the
different sorts of tanks (originally ‘stock tanks’ versus ‘all-female maintenance tanks’):
“Two days prior to the mate choice tests, we transferred all focal females to different
maintenance tanks (80 × 40 × 30 cm), in which they were held in groups of 10-15 individuals.
Except for the absence of males, conditions were the same as in the mixed-sex stock tanks.”
lines 112-114)
Line 170: Was the LMM run assuming a Gaussian distribution? If not, what sort of
distribution was used? If so, were the proportion data normally distributed; that is, would
another distribution be more appropriate for this analysis?
The LMM indeed assumed a Gaussian error distribution. Information in this direction is
provided at the end of the Statistical analyses section:
“Assumptions of normal error distribution and homoscedasticity (as required for the
analytical models we used) were met in case of all dependent variables”. (lines 195-197)
Line 236: Insert "are" between "sexual activity" and "dependent"
Changed accordingly.

n the MS entitled: ‘Context-dependent female mate choice maintains variation in male sexual
activity’ Carolin Sommer-Trembo and coll. tested whether female prefer males with
ntermediate male sexual activity in a series of two-choice tests in which female eastern
mosquitofish could choose between two male animations, one in which male showed no
sexual activity (control) and one in which the male showed a low, intermediate and high level
of sexual activity. Females with different degree of previous sexual experience, and in
solation vs. in a group, were tested. The results suggest that
) Experienced females avoid males with very high sexual activity, prefer males with
ntermediate sexual activity, whereas they do not show any preference between sexually
nactive males and males with low sexual activity.
i) Experience females in a shoal do not avoid males with high sexual activity, whereas the
preference for the other two types of males remains substantially unchanged.
ii) Virgin females (inexperienced) did not discriminate between controls and any of the three
ypes of males.
The manuscript is very well written, data presented clearly and properly discussed. I have
enjoyed reading it. I think it represents a nice contribution because, although female choice
studies are numerous, it is quite rare that more than two options are given to females, reducing
he possibility to detect non-linear mate preference functions. As such this is a nice
contribution to the field.
We thank the reviewer very much for the positive evaluation of our study. We will address
below all of his suggestions and concerns point-by-point.
There are some points that need attention, though, before firm conclusions can be reached. I
isted my points below:
1) Measure of proximity preference: Preference is expressed as the proportion of time near the
active male stimulus over the total time in the choice zones. This is OK, but it is necessary to
know how much time on average (and the range of variation) females spent near the screens.
Virgin females should be more attracted by males than gravid, sexually receptive females (as
hose used in the ‘experienced’ groups), thus it may be worth comparing the absolute time
spent in proximity of the screens in the three groups (see also my next point).
We thank the reviewer for this comment and included information about total association
imes in the methods section of our revised manuscript:
“Total time spent in both preference zones (= total association time) differed among cohorts
one-way ANOVA: F2,47 = 32.96, p < 0.001) and was highest in virgins (mean ± SE: 330 ± 26
s), followed by sexually experienced females (294 ± 13 s). Experienced females tested in a
group showed the lowest total association times (112 ± 15 s), probably because they spent
more time in the neutral zone associating with the female group. This does, however, not
necessarily affect relative times spent near the different animations.” (lines 222-227)
n line with the reviewer’s prediction, virgin females showed the highest total association
imes.
2) Proximity to the screens as a measure of mating preference: It is necessary to support the
assumption that female proximity reflects a sexual interest towards the male video stimulus.
Alternatively, females may be just attracted by the fact that they see ‘more movement’ on the
screen, rather than by sexual motivation towards the male animation. Note that the results
may be explained by non sexual interest towards the video stimuli and this interest may vary
with experience and the presence of a same-sex shoal.
We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment. We now include supporting references
rom other studies on different poeciliid fishes suggesting that female proximity does actually
eflect sexual interest:
“Association times in similar dichotomous mate choice tests have been demonstrated to
provide information about female mating preferences in related species [39-41]” (lines 137-
139)
Furthermore we refer to studies on poeciliids that successfully used video animations similar
o those used in the current study:
“Using animated stimuli is a way to standardize behavioural experiments, increases their
repeatability, and provides robust internal controls (as only the trait of interest will be
manipulated while providing otherwise identical stimuli) and has become a powerful tool to
study mate choice [42]. Video animations have been successfully applied in behavioural
studies on Gambusia and other poeciliids [21, 43-46]” (154-158)
Still, to meet the reviewer’s valid point, we discuss the idea of social attraction as an
alternative explanation for our results:
“An alternative, not mutually exclusive explanation of female preferences for sexually active
males over control males could be social attraction. While fish in control animations only
showed continuous swimming movement, animations of sexually active males additionally
showed nipping behaviour, which could attract focal females as it resembles conditions in
natural shoals, or simply because the more active animation pair was more conspicuous.
However, those explanations fail to explain the observed bell-shaped preference function,
especially the distinct (context-dependent) avoidance of animations showing the highest level
of sexual activity. Avoidance of male sexual harassment provides a more plausible
explanation for this pattern.” (lines 252-259)
3) Virgin females in a shoal: It is not explained why inexperienced females were not tested
also in a shoal.
The main question of our study was whether female G. holbrooki use male sexual activity as a
mate choice criterion. From this main question, we derived two further questions: (1) will the
observed preference (function) change when the social environment changes, i.e., when the
net costs of associating with highly sexually active males change? (2) Will the observed
pattern of mate choice change when testing females without prior sexual experience (i.e.
emales that never experienced male sexual harassment)?
To additionally test virgin females in a female group would open a totally new research
question, namely whether perceived protection in a shoal is learned or innate. Although this is
ndeed another interesting question, it was not the aim of the present study to answer it.
Given the results of our tests using virgin females, which showed no preference for any of the
male behavioural phenotypes, we would not expect that additional conclusions could be
derived from testing virgins in a group.
4) Choice of the sexual activity in the video playbacks: according to the data presented in the
supplementary data, only one male out of 18 performed more than 3 mating attempts per min,
and he did on average just slightly more than 3 attempts per min. This value (3) was instead
he mating rate chosen for the intermediate male, and the high rate was 6 mating attempts per
min. The authors justify this choice because ‘By sharing their attention between both
animations, focal females were likely to underestimate the sexual activity of the animation
showing a sexually active male’. This explanation is a bit weak, as it would apply to any two-
choice test, even if based on live stimuli. I think that there are published data on sexual
activity of eastern mosquitofish and that should be provided to support this choice. It is
clearly important to provide evidence that the sexual activity range used in this study reflects
natural range of variation to conclude that there is selection for intermediate sexual activity.
We thank the reviewer for this comment and elaborated on the respective paragraph:
“We tested female responses to males showing different levels of sexual activity. Additional
experimentation in our laboratory found numbers of sexual behaviours to range between 0.7
and 3.4 behaviours per minute when ample mating opportunities were provided (one male
cohabited with three females, see Supplemental material S1), which is in line with previous
studies on this species [17,33]. However, we decided to roughly double the frequencies for
ow, medium and high sexual activity in the animations for the following reasons: male G.
holbrooki typically switch between phases of burst sexual activity, during which they show
ncessant pursuit of females and frequent gonopodial thrusting, and phases of low or no
sexual activity (Authors, personal observation). During phases of peak sexual activity (which
often last no longer than few seconds), females are exposed to elevated levels of male
harassment, which is neglected when averaging male sexual activity over a much longer
observation phase. Moreover, in our experiment quantifying variation in male mating activity,
we used groups of familiar individuals (Supplemental material S1). Poeciliid males, however,
show elevated mating frequencies after brief social isolation or when they encounter a novel
emale [34-37]—both of which are likely to happen regularly under natural conditions. We,
herefore, defined 1.5 sexual interactions per minute as low sexual activity, 3 as medium, and
6 as high sexual activity. These frequencies elicited female responses in a pilot study (not
shown).” (lines 95-111)
5) Denominator degrees of freedom (line 191-2): in a LMM the ddf should be similar to the
number of subjects (n=48) and not to the number of observations, otherwise the results
become unduly permissive. Since your experimental design is balanced, I would suggest to
use a ‘standard’ GLM, in which female identity is entered as random factor (SPSS provides
his routine) and that will provide unbiased ddf. You also need to arcsine transform
proportions prior to analysis.
Thank you for that comment! The denominator df in our model is defined by the observations
as we choose a scaled identity covariation type and used female ID as subject grouping factor
with random intercepts for each female). We also tried different covariance types which
affected ddf but not the fixed effects outcome. Thus, we would like to keep the analysis as it
s. If the editor as well as the reviewer prefers a repeated-measures GLM, we will include this
analysis as well. We did not use an arcsin-sqrt-transformation for the SOP values as residuals
ollowed Gaussian distribution.

Comments to the Author(s)
n this study the authors investigated whether females preferred sexually high active, medium
or less active males in Gambusia holbrooki. They tested females experienced in mate choice
alone or presented three additional familiar females during mate choice. Additionally, they
ested virgin female to see whether experience might explain different mate preferences.
nstead using live stimulus males in a binary choice situation they used virtual stimulus males
and females, thus they could standardize male sexual activity. They provide videos with
males showing low, medeium or high sexual activity to a virtual female stimulus.
n the supplementary materials authors provided information how they measure and
categorized sexual activity in males in a different population of Gambusia holbrooki. Here
hey observed a single male together with three unfamiliar females and measured approaches
of the male to a female „in the blind portion of her visual field“, nipping a t the females
genital pore, and gonopodial thrusts for 10 min. Whereas nipping and number of gonopodial
hrusts is easy to observe and to quantify, I think it is not easy to measure and quantify the
approaches of a male to a female because there were three females around and males often
switch from approaching one female to another female.
The aim of this experiment was to investigate whether individual males show consistency in
heir sexual activity. We used the sum of different sexual behaviours (gonopodial thrusts,
nippings, approaches from behind) as dependent variable when testing for consistency and
ound high and significant repeatability values. In this context, the reviewer expresses concern
at the correct quantification of “approaches from behind”. We agree that this variable might
be harder to assess that the (more obvious) other behaviours. In our revised manuscript, we
decided to also provide repeatability estimates of gonopodial thrusts alone, as this behaviour
can hardly be mistaken. We still obtained very similar results:
“When we considered only gonopodial thrusting instead (i.e., disregarding pre-copulatory
behaviours) we found a similar repeatability estimate (R = 0.51, p < 0.001).” (Supplemental
material S1; lines 74-75).
Moreover, we believe that our way of quantifying “approaches from behind” was valid since
t is highly correlated with both other measures of sexual activity within individuals (rP =
0.68, p = 0.002, n = 18).
n a separate experiment they measured the distance a male is swimming alone through a
ank. The authors hypothesized that males show a consistent pattern in sexual activity when
ested same male on three different days and that this sexual activity is positive correlated to
swimming activity. They stated „Here we provide additional data demonstrating pronounced
ndividual variation, coupled high behavioral consistency, in male sexual activity of our study
species.“ There was, however, only a very narrow range regarding the sexual activity of tested
males (mean: 2 <U+F0B1> 0.1, range 0.7 – 3.4/ min). When considering Fig. S1 it seems that most of
he 18 males changed their sexual activity in the course of the three days and that the variation
within males is higher than variation between males. This is in contrast to a consistent
ndividual pattern in males regarding sexual activity.
We humbly believe that the reviewer may be slightly misled by assuming a contradiction
between the high and significant repeatability estimates and the visual illustration of male
sexual activity (Supplementary material, Figure S1). It has to be stressed that behavioural
consistency does not require completely stable, i.e. ‘invariable’ values (= no crossing of lines
n reaction norm plots). Rather, the relation between ‘variation among individuals’ and
variation within individuals’ is what defines consistency/repeatability. This relation is
sometimes difficult to estimate based solely from visual inspection of reaction norms,
especially when the range of among-individual variation is relatively narrow. Repeatability-
values provide an objective quantification of consistency by comparing both variance
parameters (Bell et al. 2009, Animal Behaviour, 77: 771-783). Since our R-values are higher
han average R-values in empirical behavioural studies (Bell et al. 2009) and are significantly
different from zero, we infer that our results support the claim that consistent individual
patterns in male sexual activity exist in our study species.
The result of the main study was that females experienced in mate choice avoided highly
sexual active males and preferred medium active males. When females were accompanied by
hree other females the preferred medium active males but chose low and high active males
andomly. The authors, however, stated that „Notably, female [with three other females]
esponses to males with high sexual activity were significantly different from those observed
when females were tested without a shoal present. There is, however, no evidence for this
statement.
Evidence for this statement comes from comparisons of 95% confidence intervals of
estimated marginal means. We rephrased this information, hoping that we could render this
passage better understandable:
“Notably, female responses to males with high sexual activity were significantly different from
hose observed when females were tested without a shoal present (this difference was
evidenced by non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals of estimated marginal means
between both cohorts of females; see Supplementary material, table S5)” (lines 214-218)
also do not follow the authors when stating „..G. holbrooki males show pronounced and
consistent individual variation in sexual activity“ (line 211).
Please see our answer to your second comment above.
Sexually inexperienced females showed neither preference nor avoidance regarding sexual
active males. Thus, these females might be a vector for the maintenance of different levels of
sexual activity in males.
We thank the reviewer for this comment. We now include this idea at the end of the
discussion:
“This finding has two important implications: (1) virgin females potentially also contribute to
he maintenance of variation in male sexual activity. (2) …” (lines 280-282)
am missing a control. When presenting the group of females to focal females it might be that
ocal females spent more time within the neutral zone near their conspecifics than females
ested alone. The group of females might, therefore, lead to a decrease in the amount of time
spending in both preference zones. Authors should either show that there was no decrease in
ime spent or they should test Gambusia females accompanied with three females of similar
size of another poeciliid species.
We now present total association times of all cohorts of focal females:
“Total time spent in both preference zones (= total association time) differed among cohorts
one-way ANOVA: F2,47 = 32.96, p < 0.001) and was highest in virgins (mean ± SE: 330 ± 26
s), followed by sexually experienced females (294 ± 13 s). Experienced females tested in a
group showed the lowest total association times (112 ± 15 s),...” (lines 222-225)
n line with the reviewer’s argumentation, females in a group spent more time in the neutral
zone. We agree that this is probably due to interactions of the focal females with the group,
which leads to overall decreased attention towards both screens:
“…probably because they spent more time in the neutral zone associating with the female
group…” (lines 225-226)
However, our main aim was to investigate whether these females would show a different
preference function compared to females tested alone. Preference was defined as (time spent
near the sexually active male) / (total association time). This relation should, however, not be
affected by an overall decreased attention towards both screens:
“This does, however, not necessarily affect relative times spent near the different
animations.” (lines 226-227)
