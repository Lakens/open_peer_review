I am really frustrated because the definition of the model is still not clear to me despite the
authors' claim that, following my comments, they improved the description. I myself will not be
able to reproduce what the authors did because of the lack of the clear definition, which is a very
serious defect of a scientific paper.
The authors MUST give a STEP-BY-STEP definition of the evolution of their model. It is essential.
In fact, even the figure caption for 1B is slightly better than the main text in this regard, but Fig.
1B is never referred to in the mid paragraph of page 3, which irritates me more (and will irritate
potential readers). What is "a" and what is "p" in Fig. 1B? I really do not understand what the
authors try to say there.
Try to have a non-expert read the paper and ask him/her to reproduce the time evolution of the
model. I am sure he/she will not be able to do it. Improve the description until he/she can
reproduce it.

In the present article, the authors have proposed a new generative model of complex networks
where the number of nodes nonlinearly grows in time and the incoming nodes do not use
information about other nodes in selecting the nodes to connect to. They have investigated the
model numerically to find that the model reproduces main features of various complex networks
such as broad degree distributions and rich-club structure.
In light of the acceptance policy of the journal, I consider that the present manuscript can be
accepted with some corrections. The model and results I believe are sound. The text, however, is
hard to follow and confounding for some reasons (see below for specific comments).
(1) The paper lacks structure. It would be much easier to follow if the text is constructed under
headings such as Introduction, Results, Discussion, Methods etc. and perhaps subsections under
them.
(2) The authors dwell on neural applications here and there (as they are a leading team in the
field). This makes the whole manuscript confounding. If the authors want to say that the present
model is a viable model for neural network formation, at least the following issues should be
addressed.
(2-1) Spatial scale. Does a single node correspond to a single neueron? Or a single region of
interest (ROI)? I am not asking the authors to be super-realistic. However, in the current form, the
association between applications and the model is too vague.
(2-2) Spatial constraint. Neurons tend to be connected to others when the distance of the two
neurons is small (I don't raise references as I am pretty sure the authors know them). But the
present model is not a spatial model?
(2-3) Exponential growth. Evidence that the number of neurons grows exponentially in time, or at
least nonlinearly in time, is not there. References?
4
As an example, at the end of the first paragraph of the manuscript, the authors write ".. is difficult
to justify in a neural context". Of course, it is, because the duplication-divergence model (and
many other related models) is not intended to be applied to neuronal networks. Reading this, one
would expect that the authors are developing a (state-of-the-art) generative model for neuronal
networks. This led to my comments above.
If the authors do not want to pursue neural applications too strongly, I recommend that they
revise the manuscript to tone down in this respect, deleting some "neural" discussion here and
there.

(5) p.5, line 43: Analysis of preterm-born adult brain connectome. This is a very special example
(atypical brain). Why this example? If the authors are interested in showing different extent of
rich-club structure between typical and atypical brains, a straightforward way is to analyse data
directly using network analysis (e.g., measuring rich-club coefficients), not using a generative
model.

Reply: We are sorry to hear about this lack of clarity of the model description,
and we have invested much effort to address this point. In particular, we have
added a pseudocode description that captures the essential features of the
algorithm, and which also explains the difference between the a and p parameters
for the NL_A and NL_P growth scenarios. Moreover, the Matlab code of these models
will also be made available on the Dryad Digital Repository as recommended by the
journal. We hope that reviewer 1 will find this version’s clarity appropriate.

(see below for specific comments).
(1) The paper lacks structure. It would be much easier to follow if the text is
constructed under headings such as Introduction, Results, Discussion, Methods
etc. and perhaps subsections under them.
Reply: We have added sections and subsections as indicated, as well as moved
parts from the supplementary material into the main text for a more substantial
methods section of the manuscript.
(2) The authors dwell on neural applications here and there (as they are a
leading team in the field). This makes the whole manuscript confounding. If the
authors want to say that the present model is a viable model for neural network
formation, at least the following issues should be addressed.
(2-1) Spatial scale. Does a single node correspond to a single neuron? Or a
single region of interest (ROI)? I am not asking the authors to be super-
realistic. However, in the current form, the association between applications and
the model is too vague.
In the mammalian brain, a single node would correspond to a region of interest,
because a number of studies (as mentioned in our work) demonstrate the presence
of highly connected brain regions and rich-club organization in networks of such
regions in human (van den Heuvel & Sporns J Neurosci 2011), cat (de Reus and van
den Heuvel J Neurosci, 2013), macaque (Harriger et al. PLoS ONE, 2012), or mouse
cortex (Oh et al. Nature 2014). However, results show that the principle of
nonlinear growth can also explain hub-related connectivity structures among
individual neurons in certain non-mammalian species, such as C. elegans (Towlson
et al. J Neurosci, 2013), for which we used a dataset in this work. We edited the
parts of the Discussion section to clarify this point.
(2-2) Spatial constraint. Neurons tend to be connected to others when the
distance of the two neurons is small (I don't raise references as I am pretty
sure the authors know them). But the present model is not a spatial model?
Space is not an explicit model component of the nonlinear growth model, but is
complementary to the concept of space. Given that our model does not rely on
non-local information exchange, it could be combined with many spatial models,
and is compatible with formation of short and long-distance connectivity. For
example, long-distance connections in C. elegans preferentially occur between
neuron pairs that are born early indicating that, at the time of connection
establishment, these connections would have been to spatially nearby targets
(Varier and Kaiser, PLoS Comput Biol 2011). We have added comments on this
spatial aspect to the Discussion section, and for a clearer separation from
spatial models removed the “local” wording from the title.
(2-3) Exponential growth. Evidence that the number of neurons grows exponentially
in time, or at least nonlinearly in time, is not there. References?
Exponential proliferation of neurons is supported by the following references,
which we also included in the manuscript:
Rakic, Pasko. "A small step for the cell, a giant leap for mankind: a hypothesis
of neocortical expansion during evolution." Trends in neurosciences 18.9 (1995):
383-388.
Caviness, V. S., Takao Takahashi, and R. S. Nowakowski. "Numbers, time and
neocortical neuronogenesis: a general developmental and evolutionary model."
Trends in neurosciences 18.9 (1995): 379-383.
White, Tonya, et al. "The development of gyrification in childhood and
adolescence." Brain and cognition 72.1 (2010): 36-45.
Butts, Thomas, Mary J. Green, and Richard JT Wingate. "Development of the
cerebellum: simple steps to make a ‘little brain’." Development 141.21 (2014):
4031-4041.
As an example, at the end of the first paragraph of the manuscript, the authors
write ".. is difficult to justify in a neural context". Of course, it is, because
the duplication-divergence model (and many other related models) is not intended
to be applied to neuronal networks. Reading this, one would expect that the
authors are developing a (state-of-the-art) generative model for neuronal
networks. This led to my comments above.
If the authors do not want to pursue neural applications too strongly, I
recommend that they revise the manuscript to tone down in this respect, deleting
some "neural" discussion here and there.
Reply: We thank the reviewer for this advice, and we have adapted the manuscript
at multiple locations to improve the applicability of the model to neural
networks while still highlighting that more general applications are also
possible.
[Minor comments]
(3) p.2, line 22: The parenthesis "(i.e. a new connection ..." is not closed.
We have amended this in the revised version.
(4) p.2, 37: "The early growth of the Internet would be...". References?
We have added the reference of Zhang et al., New J Phys (2008) to support this
claim.
(5) p.5, line 43: Analysis of preterm-born adult brain connectome. This is a very
special example (atypical brain). Why this example? If the authors are interested
in showing different extent of rich-club structure between typical and atypical
brains, a straightforward way is to analyse data directly using network analysis
(e.g., measuring rich-club coefficients), not using a generative model.
This example is well-suited because it is rather counterintuitive that in this
example of brain malformation an even more pronounced rich-club organization is
observed. The study of Karolis et al 2016 (that we cite) analyzed such
differences between control and atypical brain structure. Our contribution in
this respect is that we show that our mechanistic, generative model can explain
this surprising increase in rich-club organization in these very preterm brains.
Hence, we provide a more general and deeper understanding of the previous
analysis results. We have amended the manuscript to make this point clearer.
