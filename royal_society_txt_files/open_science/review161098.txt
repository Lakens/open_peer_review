Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
There are two major problems with this manuscript, both arising from insufficient insight into the
classification and and reproductive biology of rodents in particular and mammals generally.
1. Guinea pig and chinchilla belong to one major radiation of rodents (hystricomorphs). These
species have in common long gestation periods, small litters and precocial young. They differ in
these respects from myomorphs (including rat, mouse and hamster) and sciuromorphs as can
clearly be seen from Figure 5 in Martin (Evol Biol 2008; 35: 125-1459). The statement on lines 44-45
is misleading as litter size may be small for a laboratory rodent but certainly not for a
hystricomorph rodent.
2. The analyses in Figure 1 repeat the more extensive studies of Martin (e.g. J Exp Biol 2005; 208:
1731-1747). In my view, the Figure should be removed and reference made to Martin's work.
Alternatively, the authors' re-analysis should be presented under Results and discussed in
relation to Martin. It should then be made clear that Martin's account contrasted hystricomorph
and myomorph rodents and that chinchilla is but one of many rodents with long gestations and
small litters.
Minor points
3. It is correct to contrast guinea pig with chinchilla as regards litter size. However, it would be
useful to note that the large litter size of guinea pigs (compared to chinchilla and many other
hystricomorphs) is the result of selective breeding during some 1000 years of domestication
(Spotorno et al. in Kelt et al. (eds) UC Publications in Zoology 2007; 134: 367-88). Average litter
size in the wild species Cavia aperea is 2.2 (Rood & Weir JRF 1970; 23: 393-409).
4. I recommend changing foetus to fetus throughout. Please consult Boyd & Hamilton (BMJ 18
February 1967; p. 425) for a learned discussion of the correct spelling.
5. The title is a bit clumsy. Alternatives could be, "...novel animal model of pregnancy," or
"...novel animal model for pregnancy research."
6. Abstract line 9: change "it turns out" to "we show"
7. Page 4 line 12: change word order to, "the placenta itself consumes"
8. Page 4 lines 29-30: whilst the statement is supported by ref. [20], it would be a useful service to
the reader to quote the earlier and comprehensive study by Tibbitts & Hillemann (J Morph 1959;
105: 317-65).

imaging that you perform in this paper.
Line 47: Describe guinea pig offspring as "precocious" , as are chinchilla newborns , rather than
"large offspring". They are not just large but fully formed.

Guinea pigs, rabbits and chinchillas which all have discoid hemochorial placentas. Then GP and
chinch have longer gestations which is advantageous over rodents etc. Then explain why a

Associate Editor's comments:
Comments to the Author:
The manuscript has now been thoroughly reviewed by two reviewers. Both reviewers found the
study of interest to the general readership, but both also raised a series of questions and criticisms
that led the reviewers to ask for a major revision of the manuscript before publication.
The manuscript has therefore been marked down as "Major revision is needed"
From an editorial standpoint we see the following issues as particularly important to revise:
Reviewer 1:
It will be crucial to address points 1-3 raised by reviewer 1, which focus on the fact that previous
studies on allometric issues (Martin et al) have not been given adequate space in the introduction
and intellectual discussion of the issues. The authors should therefore explain better in the
introduction how to draw a distinction between the different rodents (hystricomorph and
myomorph) and where their model system would fit into this distinction. The other comments by
the reviewer seem self-explanatory and should be addressed by appropriate changes in the text.
Reviewer 2:
The reviewer also raises criticism with respect to the comparison of this new model with other
animal models with similar placentations. They feel that often the results were not related back to
original data or measurements, and they state in their comment to the editor that the discussion
was hard to follow, as it did not provide a clearer distinction/comparison to other species. The
occasional confusion and problem with clarity in the text and in the description of experiments
and conclusion is well formulated in the review, and the authors need to address all the criticisms
and questions raised by the reviewer point by point.
While the reviews may seem to require a lot of re-writing and amending of the manuscript, it is
clear that it will be very beneficial to the eventual publication. The reviewers are experts in the
7
field, and if even experts have problems reading the manuscript, the more general reader or
student, will certainly benefit from the requested revisions.

Comments to the Author:
In their revised version of the manuscript, the authors have been very careful and diligent in
addressing the questions and criticisms raised by the two reviewers. They have revised the title
and the abstract of the manuscript, and have added references and clarified the text in several
instances as suggested by the reviewers. Important experimental details were added as well. A
few of the comments made by the reviewers clearly went beyond the scope of the present
manuscript, and it is good to see that the authors now specifically mention that their study is a
proof-of-concept study.
The revisions have greatly improved the clarity and conclusions of the manuscript, both the
methods and conclusions are easier to follow and all the main points raised by the reviewers have
been addressed. For this reason, the manuscript is now ready for publication.
sponse to referees:
ar Editor, Royal Society Open Science
nk you very much for handling this manuscript and the opportunity to submit a revised version
he manuscript. We very much value the detailed response, and the comments of the two
ewers have been very constructive and have helped improving the manuscript. We would like
mphasize that the aim of the manuscript is to introduce the pregnant chinchilla as a novel
del for experimental obstetrics in the context of existing laboratory animals (mice, rats, etc) only,
our aim is not to compare the pregnant chinchilla with wild-life animals. The reason for this
ision is that our key message is to present animal model which is easy to handle, affordable and
licable to current standards of scientific laboratory procedures.
hope that you and the reviewers find our response satisfactory. In the revised version of the

mments to the Author(s)
re are two major problems with this manuscript, both arising from insufficient insight into the
sification and reproductive biology of rodents in particular and mammals generally.
ile the following points of critique are useful in a general biological discussion regarding
ling in reproductive physiology in mammals, the application of these points to a study on
ropriate animal model selection for biomedical research arises from insufficient insight in
selection of good biomedical animal models. It is a hallmark of the Nobel laureate
gust Kroghs principle that a good animal model does not only show the desired
racteristics, but that these characteristics can also be studied in a convenient manner.
refore, while it is true that many of the characteristic that make the chinchilla an
ropriate model in obstetric research can also be found in other hystricomorph rodents,
st of these (with the exception of the guinea pig) fail the convenience term because these
cies have not been established as laboratory animals.
uinea pig and chinchilla belong to one major radiation of rodents (hystricomorphs). These
cies have in common long gestation periods, small litters and precocial young. They differ in
se respects from myomorphs (including rat, mouse and hamster) and sciuromorphs as can
rly be seen from Figure 5 in Martin (Evol Biol 2008; 35: 125-1459). The statement on lines 44-45
isleading as litter size may be small for a laboratory rodent but certainly not for a
tricomorph rodent.
have indicated that the chinchilla and the guinea pig are hystricomorphs. We believe a
p discussion of rodent phylogeny falls out of the focus of this paper. However, we
nowledged the importance of Martin et al (2008), and a former publication by the same
hor group (Martin RD. 2008. Evolution of Placentation in Primates: Implications of
mmalian Phylogeny. Evol Biol 35: 12545), and these are now included in the reference
.
he analyses in Figure 1 repeat the more extensive studies of Martin (e.g. J Exp Biol 2005; 208:
1-1747). In my view, the Figure should be removed and reference made to Martin's work.
rnatively, the authors' re-analysis should be presented under Results and discussed in relation
Martin. It should then be made clear that Martin's account contrasted hystricomorph and
omorph rodents and that chinchilla is but one of many rodents with long gestations and small
rs.
he revised version of the manuscript, we have referenced Martins work. The interesting
er by Martin et al (J Exp Biol 2005; 208: 1731-1747) did not aim their focus on
ablished laboratory models in the proposed paper, but instead deals with (allometric)
ling in mammalian reproductive biology in general. Therefore, we see no need to remove
ure 1 because we specifically aim our target on established laboratory animals.

is correct to contrast guinea pig with chinchilla as regards litter size. However, it would be
ful to note that the large litter size of guinea pigs (compared to chinchilla and many other
tricomorphs) is the result of selective breeding during some 1000 years of domestication
otorno et al. in Kelt et al. (eds) UC Publications in Zoology 2007; 134: 367-88). Average litter size
he wild species Cavia aperea is 2.2 (Rood & Weir JRF 1970; 23: 393-409).
nks for the comment. Although this is nice-to-know information, we believe it is not
d-to-know information in laboratory settings, and information about the effects of
mestication therefore falls out of the scope of this paper. We acknowledge that wild
nea pigs have small litter size, but it is not very useful in a biomedical research settings
ere the research animals would come from domestic guinea pigs.

nks for the comment. The manuscript by Mess & Cater (2009) presented a detailed
rview of the ontogenetic differentiation of the interhaemal barrier and the molecular
cental phylogenetics in rodents. We believe that such information is beyond the scope of
manuscript, because we focus entirely on the currently domesticated laboratory-
ilable models.

nks for the comment. Please note that the aim of the manuscript is to introduce the
gnant chinchilla as a novel model for experimental obstetrics in the context of existing
oratory animals (mice, rats, etc) only, and our aim is not to compare the pregnant
nchilla with wild-life animals. The reason for this decision is that our key message is to
sent animal model which is easy to handle, affordable and applicable to current standards
cientific laboratory procedures. Thus, we believe that monkey and other primate models
beyond the scope of this paper, because the use of monkeys are almost zero in todays
cental/obstetric research.
o, we have added to the text that sheep have cotyledonary placentas.

e 37: Were 4 animals used for the entire paper or only in this section? Were statistically
nificant # used or was this a proof of concept study? If so I would state that in the abstract or
oduction
, all animals were used, and we have now added this information in the text (Introduction
tion and in the methods and materials section). Furthermore, we have specified that this
proof-of-concept study.

e rewritten parts of the Introduction section, so it more clearly introduces the different

agree with the reviewer that the Results section could be better organized, and we have
rganized this section accordingly in the revised version of the manuscript. Furthermore,
have introduced bicarbonate and alanine together with pyruvate and lactate in the
thods section.

thods section of how each of the 3 studies were conducted ie terminal or survival studies.
nks for the comment. It has now been specified in the methods section which studies
re terminal and which were survival studies.
cussion/Conclusion: Explain how your findings /measurements compare to GP, NHP and
mans so why a chinchilla placenta does make a good model for human placenta.
mparison was made to the Friesen-Waldner and Markovic studies but what does it mean ? does
ean the chinchilla is good? does it mean the chinchilla is better as a model for humans than
te, that we do not claim that our results by any means are comparable to those
entially measured in humans, although such information does not exist. We describe and
erpret our results in a descriptive manner, e.g. we demonstrate the proof-of-principle of
animal model for (some) daily available laboratory phenotyping methods. The results
nd in our study seems to resemble those by Friesen-Waldner and Markovic studies (in
s), but in neither case we can judge the clinical implications. But as we wrote in the
roduction sections, the data from the chinchilla placenta may potentially have advantages
r the rat placenta due to its better structural similarities with the human placenta.

es 2-7 How are these findings in rodents from other published work relevant to this paper?
es 9-10: Is the Fetus supposed to uptake Urea and bicarb? How is this better than GP?

hniques is the convenience that measurements can be performed many times during the
tation period
e 37-39: Move or copy to Results section.
describe in the Results section that the fetus and placenta of the pregnant chinchilla are
dly visible with conventional CT.
e 11: Should be an explanation of this table in the Results section and a summary of what you
nd from this data. I don't understand what the blood glucose measurements data
fore/after" mean in the chart?
animal characteristics in table 1 ensure that all animals were stabile during the
eriments, which has now been added to the results section. Blood glucose is measured
ore and after the scan (i.e. right after induction of anesthesia and right before awakening
euthanasia), which has now been specified.

e 19: Difficult to understand the significance of these charts? What is this data telling the
der?
importance of these charts is that we have specifically highlighted the animals currently
ilable as laboratory research species, because the aim of the manuscript is to introduce
pregnant chinchilla as a novel model for experimental obstetrics in the context of
sting laboratory animals (mice, rats, etc) only, and our aim is not compare the pregnant
nchilla with wild-life animals.

Compare these data to humans so we can see if this chinchilla data is relevant?
figure text has been rewritten for better explanation of the figures. To our knowledge,
