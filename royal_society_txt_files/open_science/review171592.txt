Combining visualization techniques and concepts from network science, the authors study the
effect of Avastin on the evolution of the vascular network for chick embryos. They find that this
antibody affects the structure and statistical properties of the network. This is definitely a timely
and interesting subject related to tumor growth. Results are interesting, well described and
scientifically sound. However, there are some points that I would like to see discussed by the
authors before recommending publication:
1. It is found that the growth rate in the presence of the antibody is larger than in the control. Is
there an argument why? Apparently the inhibitor speeds up the dynamics, this sounds
counterintuitive.
2. Have the authors considered the effect of different concentrations of Avastin? If not, why was
this particular value considered?
3. In Fig. 5 is shown that the number of clusters is characterized by a maximum at a certain time
t*, but that t* is different for the control and the case with Avastin. Isn’t it just a consequence of
the differences in the growth rate? If we multiply the position of the maximum by the growth rate
we get, within error bars, the same value for both cases.
4. The authors just discuss the value of the fractal dimension for initial times, arguing that is
consistent with the one for cluster-cluster aggregation. However, initially, finite-size effects are
very strong. However, the asymptotic values are also interesting. While the value for the control
is consistent with DLA the one for Avastin-treated embryos is rather larger.

The manuscript by Alves and colleagues describes a method to characterize the development of
two-dimensional vascular networks in avian embryos and apply this to analyse the effect of
bevacizumab (Avastin) on early vasculogenesis. In their method the authors generate bright-field
time-lapse images of embryos that are then analysed in two ways. First, the authors manually
threshold the images to detect the number of connected components (clusters) within the
acquired field of view using existing plugins of ImageJ. For the second method, the authors use
the existing software AngioTool which was specifically developed for the analysis of vascular
networks. From the connectivity matrix obtained from AngioTool they then calculate standard
network metrics such as shortest path length and average degree of nodes. Using their method,
the authors show that the treatment increases the inter-connectivity of the vasculature within the
analysed 15h time period. The manuscript addresses an interesting topic as tools for quantifying
biological, especially morphometric, information are still in need of development. However, the
authors do not compare their results and measures with those available from (at least) AngioTool
in terms of sensitivity or efficiency. Therefore they show no proof of improvement in
methodology. Secondly, the authors show a dramatic effect on embryonic vasculature
development of a drug with known to have an effect on molecules crucial for vasculogenesis.
Therefore, it is not unexpected that their treatment has an effect on vascular assembly. Although
it is mentioned that they observe these effects at an optimal dose, no results are shown with other
doses. Taken together, the manuscript does not present a significant advancement in its current
form and therefore I cannot suggest its publication.
Further comments:
The authors use the embryonic system to draw a conclusion on the tumorigenic effect of Avastin.
In contrast, tumor studies (for example, DOI: 10.3349/ymj.2011.52.1.151 and DOI:
10.3892/etm.2014.1991) report that Avastin reduces the number of blood vessels. The authors
should address this contradiction in their manuscript.
Avastin leads to a more densely connected network in the embryo as the authors show. The
authors suggest that treatment with Avastin could improve the function of the vasculature as it
"helps to keep the healthy cells soaked in blood". But a denser network does not necessarily mean
that it is more efficient (than in the control case). It is possible that a more tree-like structure could
better serve flow, more loops could lead to inefficient blood flow through the vessels. The authors
should support their point better, or reconsider the sentence: "This effect of Avastin pinpoints an
important role against tumor growth: an homogeneous and densely connected topology helps to
keep the healthy cells soaked in blood, thus preventing tumor spreading."
This bright-field technique is not specific for endothelial cells, but only to relief patterns. This
should be pointed out and the authors could discuss the related advantages and disadvantages if
they wish.
The analyzed images show only a portion of the network and therefore limit the scope of the
method. Could this technique be applied on tiled images that contain the whole embryo without
losing resolution?
Threshold selection is potentially critical for this method. For providing guidance for others
wishing to use this technique in the future, could the authors be more specific about how to chose
a threshold? Could the authors show the sensitivity of their measures to changes in thresholding
level?
The authors show statistics typically from 3 embryos. The variability amongst embryos is only
4
pointed out in Fig9. Could the authors use their method to characterize the variability in
vasculogenesis more thoroughly?
Are Fig6 a1 and a2 generated from the same sample? Could the authors point out the benefits of
illustrating of the adjacency matrix in such form?
Description of inset missing from caption for Fig8d.
Insets on Fig9a,b are difficult to see. Are these networks representative of the spatial positions of
the vascular vessels, or are these topological descriptions?
The vessel density definition should be clarified, for example: 'Detected Vessel Area / Total
Image Area'.
Typos in references should be corrected, eg: 12, 24.
Equation 2.2 should have k' as argument for N(k')
The manuscript should be proofread and the grammar checked
Statistical concern: The number of embryos analyzed for Fig9c,d is missing.

This is an interesting work, in general rich and well described, that uses network theory analyses
to characterize vascular network formation in the chick embryo and to understand the role of
5
Avastin in shaping the network’s traits.
The work is of interest and quality, and merits publication after addressing the following minor
issues:
0. In the Materials and Methods the authors should refer to the provided movies.
1. Please define HH when it appears first.
2. The entire analysis depends on the images analysis applied to the recordings. Have the authors
verified that the results are robust to variations in the grey-level threshold or other settings?
3. The review of the used network measures is good and clarifies aspects of the analysis.
However, the definition of the treenes phi needs a bit of clarification. The authors should mention
that ranges between 0 (all closed paths) and 1 (tree like). Their treenes is not exactly the quantity
defined in Ref. [31], which ranges between -1 and 1 and is more complex in definition. Also, the
term ‘original network’ at the end of the paragraph is confusing. It should be ‘entire graph’.
4. In fig. 5, rho^{LC} at the end of the measurements seem larger for Avastin than for controls.
Can the authors provide an explanation?
5. In figs. 8b there is a huge variability in r at short times. Then this quantity reaches a maximum,
decreases, and increases again. I think it would be interesting to comment these features and their
possible interpretation. The same for the variability at short times in fig. 8c.
6. It seems that there are two time episodes in which important changes in the network take
place, namely 5h and 7.8h. Maybe the authors could explain a bit more in the conclusions the
implication of these time points for the development of the vascular network in the control and
Avastin-treated embryos.
7. In the conclusions, maybe the authors can mention if their analysis is applicable to other
embryos, for instance to understand if the mechanisms governing the formation of the vascular
network are universal or species-dependent.
B) Issues in figures
8. In most of the figures, solid squares and circles correspond to, respectively, averages of control
and Avastin experiments. But this coding changes in Fig. 5c-d. This is terribly confusing and
forces the authors to repeat again and again the symbol coding in the caption. Please follow the
same symbol coding in all the figures. Also, I notice that the open symbols cannot be seen in a
hard copy. Their outline must be thicker.
9. Symbols and colors are a bit confusing. Circles and squares look similar, particularly when the
figures are small, and the color coding is not sufficiently different. I would suggest to plot the
data using up triangles instead of squares for higher clarity.
10. There is room in most of the figures to put a legend for control and Avastin symbols (in one of
the plots is enough), so the reader can quickly perceive who is who without surfing the legend.
11. The time axis in most of the figures ranges from 0 to 15h, but some are cut at 10h. It leads to
confusion when comparing plots. If there no reason for such a difference, I would suggest to use
0-15h range in all plots.
12. Is the dotted curve in figs. 5c and 5d a fit of some sort? The fact that the curve has the same
style as the vertical one creates confusion, since it seems to indicate that the vertical line is also
some kind of fit. I suggest the authors to replace this vertical dotted line at 5h and 7.8h to maybe a
thin grey bar.
13. In all captions, it should be indicated that the vertical dotted line (or alternative mark) is a
guide to the eye for the time t=7.8h (or 5h).
14. All captions need to indicate how many experiments were used for the averaged data.
C) Writing and English issues:
- The authors tend to indicate too often in the main text which symbols in the figures correspond
to the control or Avastin case. I found it distracting and unnecessary, since this information is in
the caption (also often very repetitive) or in the figure. Please revise this issue.
- There is a number of typos and small grammar errors throughout the manuscript that must be
6
addressed. Some examples:
These experiment -> These experiments

We show the how the two-dimensional -> We show how the two-dimensional

In this manuscript, Alves et al. address the formation of a vascular network in the area opaca of
chicken embryos. This represents a very good model system to study the early stages of
vasculogenesis. The goal of this study is to obtain quantitative, dynamical data on the temporal
evolution of the vasculature. The authors use an image analysis methodology to segment the
endothelial structures and then use standard tool for network geometry to study the evolution of
the vasculature. Finally, they compare the results from control embryos to the ones from embryos
treated with a Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitor, Avastatin. The results and
insights obtained are interesting and provide a very good characterization of an important
morphogenetic process. However, I found that the comparison between the control embryos and
embryos treated with the drug is difficult to follow. The authors find that several parameters are
not altered after treating with the drug, while several others are. It would be very beneficial for
the reader if the authors presented upfront with a possible geometrical interpretation of how the
structure is changed following treatment with Avastatin. Then, they could generate a series of
arguments detailing which geometrical parameters should be altered and which should not, if
their interpretation was correct. Some comparisons between the control and drug-treated
embryos could be strengthen by statistical test, e.g. a Smirnov-Kolmogorov test to compare the
7
distributions in Figure 6.

# Answer to the Reviewer: 1
We thank the referee for his/her many suggestions for improving the paper
quality and correctness. Concerning the present report we have corrected the English
mistakes and addressed the points raised by the referee (see below). All changes in
the main text have been written in bold.
1. It is found that the growth rate in the presence of the antibody is larger than
in the control. Is there an argument why? Apparently the inhibitor speeds up
the dynamics, this sounds counterintuitive.
In the vasculogenesis process we must ponder the interaction strength among cell-to-
cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix as has been reported in
(doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0024175). The VEGF induces cells to bind to the
extracellular matrix and to other cells to form the vascular network. Probably the free
VEGF in the extracellular matrix binds more easily in Avastin decreasing the
interaction strength between the cells and the extracellular matrix living the cells more
unrestricted to move. This could improve the cells migration inducing a rapid growth
rate of vessels but with smaller diameters which seems to be the case. Since this is
highly speculative we decide not to add in the manuscript.
2. Have the authors considered the effect of different concentrations of Avastin?
If not, why was this particular value considered?
We did not considered the effect of different concentrations. We considered the dose
of 5mg/Kg because it is the typical dose applied in clinical treatments involving Avastin
as reported in (DOI: 10.1126/science.1104819, DOI: 10.1592/phco.28.11-supp.23S,
DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2006.09.3351). Our aim is to measure the structural changes
promoted on vascular network by this Avastin clinical dose.
3. In Fig. 5 is shown that the number of clusters is characterized by a maximum
at a certain time t*, but that t* is different for the control and the case with
Avastin. Isn’t it just a consequence of the differences in the growth rate? If we
multiply the position of the maximum by the growth rate we get, within error
bars, the same value for both cases.
If we understand correctly, we did not found the same result as the reviewer
suggests. In particular, <U+03C9>CONTROL= (0.42)/h; tCONTROL=2.7h; <U+03C9>*t=1.13. Doing the same
for the Avastin group we obtain: <U+03C9>AVASTIN= (0.52)/h; tAVASTIN=3.5h; <U+03C9>*t=1.82.
4. The authors just discuss the value of the fractal dimension for initial times,
arguing that is consistent with the one for cluster-cluster aggregation. However,

initially, finite-size effects are very strong. However, the asymptotic values are
also interesting. While the value for the control is consistent with DLA the one
for Avastin-treated embryos is rather larger.
We tried some models to compare our results as direct percolation and also DLA.
Although the fractal dimension achieved a plateau on control group close to (D f=1.69
± 0.01) which is consistent with in DLA as it has been reported in
(doi:org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.2428, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0024175,
doi:10.1186/1742-4682-5-12, doi:org/10.1142/S0218348X99000050), it is difficult to
affirm that DLA growth could explain vasculogenesis.
The mechanisms which drive the aggregation of endothelial cells clusters and their
subsequent organization into a network is still a subject of considerable debate and
the fractal dimension is not the only parameter to be considered to characterize vessel
the growth as it has been reported in (doi.org/10.1006/jtbi.1998.0810). So we decide
not to speculate and just leave the former result to the reader appraisal.
# Answer to the Reviewer: 2
We thank the referee for his/her many suggestions for improving the paper
quality and correctness. Concerning the present report we have corrected the English
mistakes and his/her comments are answered below. All changes in the text are
written in bold.
1. The authors use the embryonic system to draw a conclusion on the
tumorigenic effect of Avastin. In contrast, tumor studies (for example, DOI:
10.3349/ymj.2011.52.1.151 and DOI: 10.3892/etm.2014.1991) report that Avastin
reduces the number of blood vessels. The authors should address this
contradiction in their manuscript.
The target of our work is to study the vasculogenesis dynamics and quantify the
structural changes promoted by Avastin on the network topology. Our aim was not to
draw any conclusion on tumorigenic systems, but to acquire a better understanding
about the effect of Avastin on vessels growth during vasculogenesis.
As the referee correctly points out, there is already a vast literature which shows that
angiogenic inhibitors could be used to normalize tumor vasculatures (as described in
DOI: 10.1126/science.1104819). However, in our study, the control group considered
do not contain any tumor, while in the cited works (DOI: 10.3349/ymj.2011.52.1.151
and DOI: 10.3892/etm.2014.1991) the control group used had a tumor. Thus, our work
should not necessarily yield the same results. Although the difference between the
densities of the networks with and without Avastin is not so large, there are structural

Departamento de Física Telefone: +55 31 3409 5618
Caixa Postal 702 Fax: +55 31 3409 5600

differences on network topology. These topological changes may play an important
role in Avastin treatment. A signature of this effect may be displayed in Figure.2-B of
(DOI: 10.3892/etm.2014.1991) showing that the proportion of normal vascular
structures increases on the treated group.
In order to not mislead the reader we removed from the manuscript the following
statement in the abstract: “which plays an important role against tumor growth.” And
also address the problem in the next point.
2. Avastin leads to a more densely connected network in the embryo as the
authors show. The authors suggest that treatment with Avastin could improve
the function of the vasculature as it "helps to keep the healthy cells soaked in
blood". But a denser network does not necessarily mean that it is more efficient
(than in the control case). It is possible that a more tree-like structure could
better serve flow, more loops could lead to inefficient blood flow through the
vessels. The authors should support their point better, or reconsider the
sentence: "This effect of Avastin pinpoints an important role against tumor
growth: an homogeneous and densely connected topology helps to keep the
healthy cells soaked in blood, thus preventing tumor spreading."
We completely agree with referee that from our results we cannot draw a solid
conclusion for the case of tumor growth. Thus, we have removed this strong
affirmation from the main text, although we believe that in tumor assembles the
normalization of vessels could be driven by the structural changes promoted by
Avastin. Considering that in this work we measure structural changes promoted by
Avastin on a normal network topology, we have incorporated this mild affirmation
instead: “This effect of Avastin may play an important role against tumor growth”.
3. This bright-field technique is not specific for endothelial cells, but only to
relief patterns. This should be pointed out and the authors could discuss the
related advantages and disadvantages if they wish.
We thank the referee for pointing out this issue. We have added the following
statement in the main text: “Bright-field microscopy is the simplest and cheaper optical
microscopy technique. We used it since the contrast obtained was good enough for
the imaging analysis we have performed.”
4. The analyzed images show only a portion of the network and therefore limit
the scope of the method. Could this technique be applied on tiled images that
contain the whole embryo without losing resolution?
We agree that enlarging the area of observation would be benefitial for our analyziz.
However, the resolution is not the main problem, but the large variation on bright-field

contrast promoted by the variation in tissue density. This makes it difficult to apply a
uniform imaging threshold in order to identify the endothelial cell clusters. The chicken
embryo is composed by distinct areas and selecting a threshold that works in the
several regions simultaneously and along the time is a difficult task. That is why we
were only able to work in a portion of the network. On the other hand, since we are
comparing networks (control and Avastin treated ones) we are confident that the
relative differences observed in the same portion of the whole network capture the
differences at the global level.
5. Threshold selection is potentially critical for this method. For providing
guidance for others wishing to use this technique in the future, could the
authors be more specific about how to choose a threshold? Could the authors
show the sensitivity of their measures to changes in thresholding level?
To give some insights about the results, the plot in Fig (a) below shows the threshold
variation displaying the lower limit selected for the images at 0h, 7h and 15h (note that
the upper limit is fixed at 255). In order to test our method we measured the total
vessels density when using our method and when the standard program Angio-Tool
is applied. The results for both methods are showed in Fig (b). We can see that they
return very similar results.
6. The authors show statistics typically from 3 embryos. The variability amongst
embryos is only pointed out in Fig 9. Could the authors use their method to
characterize the variability in vasculogenesis more thoroughly?
We changed this figure, the old Fig.9 is now Fig.7. In this figure we show the fraction
of nodes as a function of time for a single embryo in order to highlight the sharp

percolation transition that is not so plain when we have the average. In all other
parameters the average shows the typical behavior of the single embryos and the error
bars displays the variability in vasculogenesis process. A careful study of the
variability in just the vasculogenesis process demands an increase number of
samples. While we intend to pursue this matter in further investigations, this will be left
to the future since it demands still lots of work.
7. Are Fig6 a1 and a2 generated from the same sample? Could the authors point
out the benefits of illustrating of the adjacency matrix in such form?
Yes, old Figs. 6a1 and 6a2 corresponded to the same sample (not that we have
changed this figure and the old Fig 6 is now Fig.5). The benefit is to illustrate the
codification process, where each node represents a bifurcation and a vessel between
two bifurcation points accounts for a link. This is the usual nomenclature used in the
network literature.
We have added the statement in the caption “The codification process of adjacent
matrix: panels (a1-c1) show the skeleton topology of a forming vascular network for a
control embryo and panels (a2-c2) represent the adjacent matrix extracted from the
skeleton, where each bifurcation is identified as a node, and the distance interaction
represents the links.”
8. Description of inset missing from caption for Fig 8 d.
We thank the referee for noting this. We have added the description of the inset figure
in the caption of old Fig.8d (now Fig. 6d): “The inset plot shows the average number
of nodes with the respective error bars for both groups.”
9. Insets on Fig 9 a, b are difficult to see. Are these networks representative of
the spatial positions of the vascular vessels, or are these topological
descriptions?
The size of these insets has been increased for better visualization as required (note
that old Fig. 9 is now Fig.7). They display the spatial position of the bifurcations (nodes)
of the vascular networks. The aim is to show an example of the final stage achieved
for the particular sample of control and Avastin-treated embryo. Also we have added
this description in the caption: “The insets display the spatial position of vascular
network bifurcation.”
10. The vessel density definition should be clarified, for example: 'Detected
Vessel Area / Total Image Area'.
We corrected this definition as suggested.

11. Typos in references should be corrected, eg: 12, 24. Equation 2.2 should
have k' as argument for N(k'). The manuscript should be proofread and the
grammar checked
We thank the referee for pointing out these mistakes. The above issues have been
corrected.
12. Statistical concern: The number of embryos analyzed for Fig9 c,d is missing.
We changed this figure the old Fig. 9 is now Fig. 7. We add in the caption: “The f as
a function of time in a group of three embryos for (c) control, and (d) Avastin-treated
ones”
# Answer to the Reviewer: 3
We thank the referee for his/her many suggestions for improving the paper
quality and correctness. Concerning the present report we have corrected the English
mistakes and his/her comments are answered below. All changes in the text are
written in bold.
0. In the Materials and Methods the authors should refer to the provided movies.
Thank you for pointing out this issue. We have added the sentence: “The original
movies can be found in the supplemental material VesselGrowth-ControlEmbryo.avi
and VesselGrowth-TreatedEmbryo.avi, which show the vessels formation on control
and Avastin-treated embryo respectively”.
1. Please define HH when it appears first.
We have added “Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) stage 11” in the manuscript, as
suggested.
2. The entire analysis depends on the images analysis applied to the recordings.
Have the authors verified that the results are robust to variations in the grey-
level threshold or other settings?
To give some insights about the results, the plot in Fig (a) below shows the threshold
variation displaying the lower limit selected for the images at 0h, 7h and 15h (note that
the upper limit is fixed at 255). In order to test our method we measured the total
vessels density when using our method and when the standard program Angio-Tool

is applied. The results for both methods are showed in Fig (b). We can see that they
return very similar results.
3. The review of the used network measures is good and clarifies aspects of the
analysis. However, the definition of the treenes phi needs a bit of clarification.
The authors should mention that ranges between 0 (all closed paths) and 1 (tree
like). Their treenes is not exactly the quantity defined in Ref. [31], which ranges
between -1 and 1 and is more complex in definition. Also, the term ‘original
network’ at the end of the paragraph is confusing. It should be ‘entire graph’.
We thank the referee for noting this discrepancy. We have added this explanation:
“The treeness cover the ranges from non-hierarchical, <U+03D5>=0 (the graph displays all
closed paths), to hierarchical, <U+03D5> =1 (the graph displays a tree-like structure) which is
defined as Eq (2.6).” In addition, we have now changed the original reference (doi:
10.1073/pnas.1300832110) by the new one (doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029721)
that introduces the same definition of treeness as the one we are using.
4. In fig. 5, rho^{LC} at the end of the measurements seem larger for Avastin
than for controls. Can the authors provide an explanation?
Since the region studied is finite it is possible that the largest cluster in the control
appears as two distinct branches, even though it is a single branch. In this case the
largest cluster density will be smaller than the average density of the network. On the
other hand, in the treated sample, since Avastin decreases the treeness of the network
it is more likely in the finite region to find a single branch for the largest cluster,
Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais
Instituto de Ciências Exatas
Departamento de Física Telefone: +55 31 3409 5618
Caixa Postal 702 Fax: +55 31 3409 5600

approaching his density to the network density. In this case the largest cluster density
in the treated embryo will be larger than in the control.
5. In figs. 8b there is a huge variability in r at short times. Then this quantity
reaches a maximum, decreases, and increases again. I think it would be
interesting to comment these features and their possible interpretation. The
same for the variability at short times in fig. 8c.
We changed this figure, the old Fig.8 is now Fig.6. Following the suggestion of the
referee we have incorporated this statement in the text: “In between the assortativity
oscillates, with a minimum near the same time we observe the maximum number of
clusters as shown in Fig. 4(b). The creation of new small star-like clusters compete
with the large emerging cluster which contributes to abruptly decrease the assortativity
coefficient around the time of 3 hours.” The large variability observed in at short times
is due to the heterogeneity created by the coexistence of isolated nodes and those
that are already taking part of the small connected components.
In order to illustrate this statement we show the referee the plot below, which shows
the assortativity coefficient and the number of clusters as a function of time.
6. It seems that there are two time episodes in which important changes in the
network take place, namely 5h and 7.8h. Maybe the authors could explain a bit
Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais
Instituto de Ciências Exatas
Departamento de Física Telefone: +55 31 3409 5618
Caixa Postal 702 Fax: +55 31 3409 5600
30161-970 Belo Horizonte - MG – Brasil e-mail: anafisic@gmail.com
more in the conclusions the implication of these time points for the development
of the vascular network in the control and Avastin-treated embryos.
Following the suggestion of the referee, we have add this statement in the text “In this
work, the largest cluster density is the first measurement which points out the abrupt
phase transition on the vasculogenesis process identifying two important times, one
at 5 hours, where the <U+0001D70C>LC starts to grow up, and other at 7.8 hours where it reaches a
saturation value”.
And also we have changed the conclusion to put emphasis in the specific times:
“This observation is supported by different evidences when monitoring the time
evolution of metrics such as: (i) the mean chord length, (ii) the fractal dimension of
networks Df (iii) the degree distribution P(k), (iv) the mean degree <k>, (v) the <U+F067>-index,
and (vi) the treeness <U+03D5>, some of these parameters display a discrepancy near 7.8
hours, evidencing the structural change in the network topology. On the other hand,
other measures such as (i) the clustering coefficient C, (ii) the network assortativity r,
(iii) the average path length <L> and the fraction of nodes in the largest cluster, f, do
not display difference between control and Avastin-treated embryos, since tree-like
and lattice-like structures display similar values for these quantities. Also importantly,
we have shown for both groups that around 5 hours all these parameters point out to
an abrupt transition from disconnected cell clusters to a large connected vascular
network which is a signature of the percolation in the system.
These results attest that an optimal dose of an antiangiogenic factor VEGF on a normal
embryo shapes the resulting vascular network. The new graph structure could be more
prone to drug circulation and penetration than the usual vascular architecture.”
7. In the conclusions, maybe the authors can mention if their analysis is
applicable to other embryos, for instance to understand if the mechanisms
governing the formation of the vascular network are universal or species-
dependent.
Following the recommendation of the referee, we have added this statement in the
manuscript “In more general grounds we believe that the mechanisms governing the
vascular network formation may be universal and similar analysis in other species
should give similar results.”
B) Issues in figures
8. In most of the figures, solid squares and circles correspond to, respectively,
averages of control and Avastin experiments. But this coding changes in Fig.
5c-d. This is terribly confusing and forces the authors to repeat again and again
the symbol coding in the caption. Please follow the same symbol coding in all
Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais
Instituto de Ciências Exatas
Departamento de Física Telefone: +55 31 3409 5618
Caixa Postal 702 Fax: +55 31 3409 5600

the figures. Also, I notice that the open symbols cannot be seen in a hard copy.
Their outline must be thicker.
We changed this figure, the old Fig.5 is now Fig.4. We definitely agree with the referee
that this figure is confusing. Thus, we have changed this figure also to address the
issue 11. Instead of showing the number of clusters (already in the item (a)) we plot in
the insets of (c) and (d) the average largest cluster density for both groups in the
interval of 15 hours.
9. Symbols and colors are a bit confusing. Circles and squares look similar,
particularly when the figures are small, and the color coding is not sufficiently
different. I would suggest to plot the data using up triangles instead of squares
for higher clarity.
We have changed the symbols as suggested.
10. There is room in most of the figures to put a legend for control and Avastin
symbols (in one of the plots is enough), so the reader can quickly perceive who
is who without surfing the legend.
We include the legend as suggested.
11. The time axis in most of the figures ranges from 0 to 15h, but some are cut
at 10h. It leads to confusion when comparing plots. If there no reason for such
a difference, I would suggest to use 0-15h range in all plots.
In order to better point out the transition from small clusters to the emergence of a
largest cluster in the system we show the data for one sample and cut it in 10 hours.
On the other hand, we agree with the referee and have included in the inset of the
Fig.4(c) and (d) an average plot of the largest cluster for both groups.
12. Is the dotted curve in figs. 5c and 5d a fit of some sort? The fact that the
curve has the same style as the vertical one creates confusion, since it seems
to indicate that the vertical line is also some kind of fit. I suggest the authors to
replace this vertical dotted line at 5h and 7.8h to maybe a thin grey bar.
We have changed this figure, the old Fig.5 is now Fig.4. In the plot of new Fig. 4(b),
corresponding to the old Fig. 5(a), we have changed the dotted curve by a full one
which is a Gaussian fit to guide the eye.
We add in the legend: “where the full line is a Gaussian fit just to guide the eye”
13. In all captions, it should be indicated that the vertical dotted line (or
alternative mark) is a guide to the eye for the time t=7.8h or 5h.
We have changed the captions as suggested.

14. All captions need to indicate how many experiments were used for the
averaged data.
We have include in all captions the number of samples, as suggested.
C) Writing and English issues:
- The authors tend to indicate too often in the main text which symbols in the
figures correspond to the control or Avastin case. I found it distracting and
unnecessary, since this information is in the caption (also often very repetitive)
or in the figure. Please revise this issue.
We have revised these redundancies and fix them accordingly.
- There is a number of typos and small grammar errors throughout the
manuscript that must be addressed.
We thank the referee for listing the typos found. We have corrected them.
# Answer to the Reviewer: 4
We thank the referee for his/her many suggestions for improving the paper quality and
correctness. Concerning the present report we have corrected the English mistakes
and his/her comments are answered below. All changes in the text are written in bold.
1. I found that the comparison between the control embryos and embryos
treated with the drug is difficult to follow. The authors find that several
parameters are not altered after treating with the drug, while several others are.
It would be very beneficial for the reader if the authors presented upfront with a
possible geometrical interpretation of how the structure is changed following
treatment with Avastatin. Then, they could generate a series of arguments
detailing which geometrical parameters should be altered and which should not,
if their interpretation was correct.
We agree with the referee that is a little difficult to follow the results as they were
presented. In order to make the comparison of the results less confusing we have
changed the organization of the manuscript. We now present the results in three
different sections. Each section displays parameters that better characterize a stage
of vasculogenesis process.
We have also added the following statements describing the rationale of the new
structure of the manuscript:
Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais

“We organize the results assembling the parameters that better characterize the
stages of the network formation as follow.
a) Early network formation: involves migration and aggregation among endothelial cell
clusters, what will be better characterized through a Statistical Analysis of Binary
Patterns.
(b) Network formation: identified by a percolation phase transition in the system, which
can be determined by Network Metrics, some parameters display an abrupt transition
near 5 hours.
c) Network remodeling: differentiation of vascular network, which will be identified by
Structural Metrics parameters measured on network topologies. We were able to
distinguish between tree-like topology from the more lattice-like structure near 7.8
hours. ”
2- Some comparisons between the control and drug-treated embryos could be
strengthen by statistical test, e.g. a Smirnov-Kolmogorov test to compare the
distributions in Figure 6.
Following the suggestion of the referee, we did a comparison using the Smirnov-
Kolmogorov test to compare the distributions in Figure 6 as can be seen in the new
Figure 5 in the manuscript. Even the amount of data for the statistics is small, since
we have just 3 samples, the results show a statistical difference for some node
degrees in the evolution of the network. So we add the significance in the figure.
Accordingly, we change the figure and add in the figure caption:
“The degree distributions for three embryos in each group displayed on (a3-c3) for a
control group and on (d-f) for Avastin-treated group. The symbol (**) indicates the
statistical difference of the distributions from the initial stage t=0h, which have p<0.05
calculated by Smirnov-Kolmogorov test.”
