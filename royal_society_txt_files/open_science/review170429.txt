The author studied a mathematical model of transportation across a membrane (Eqs (1) to (4))
numerically and the paper consists largely of discussions of how the rate constants affect the
transport kinetics.
As a biological physicist who publishes regularly in mainstream physics and biology journals, I
do not see what the contribution of this paper is to these communities. In my opinion, the paper
is a lengthy elaboration of various numerical analyses of a relatively simple set of equation. I do
not think I have learned anything from reading this paper. Indeed, I still do not know what
intuitive non-equilibrium thermodynamics means even though it is in the title of the paper.

This article proposes a facilitated diffusion model to describe the translocation of a substance
across a membrane mediated by an enzyme. The model uses the law of mass action to formulate
a set of differential equations for the evolution in time of the concentrations of the substance at
both sides of the membrane and of the two conformations of the enzyme. It is pointed out that the
intrinsic nonlinear nature of the law of mass action restricts the application of classical
nonequilibrium thermodynamics which only provides linear flux-force relationships. An
alternative approach, called intuitive non-equilibrium thermodynamics, is proposed.
The model proposed and the solution of the differential equations are correct. I have objections
on the new approach proposed, INET, as a definitive theory to treat facilitated diffusion
processes. Although non-equilibrium thermodynamics only applies to the linear flux-force
regime, an extension to the mesoscale, referred to as mesoscopic non-equilibrium
thermodynamics, can describe chemical and biochemical reactions in the non-linear domain; see
the feature article: The mesoscopic dynamics of thermodynamic systems, J Phys. Chem. B, 109,

This paper is about endless discussion of the results of solving the steady-state kinetic equations
on page 4 for the four state transport model shown on page 2 as Eqs. (1), (2), (3), and (4). The
analytic solution to these equations is well known and involves solving simultaneous equations
for four variables with one additional constraint (constant total concentration of the transporter).
The author provides nice, colorful graphs of the results for various possible and plausible
parameter choices using MatLab. The author provides values for the rate of transport both as a
table, and in the text, with - COUNT THEM - ten significant figures. This illustrates one of the
problems of the digital age.
The basic message of the paper seems to me to be that applications of solutions obtained by
approximations to kinetic equations should not be applied to situations where those
approximations are not valid. OK, I will agree. Further, I recognize that there are many bad
papers in the literature where this foolishness is in fact done, but that not justify publishing a
paper without new intellectual content.
Let me be very clear - this entire paper is based on a model that can be analytically solved for all
intermediate transporter concentrations and hence for all rates. There is absolutely nothing new
here, and I cannot imagine anyone being surprised by any of the results. The authors claimed
justification for publishing is that some people publish stupid and incorrect papers in the
literature, a claim that is perfectly true but does not justify publishing what amounts to a
homework assignment. I have some sympathy with the authors frustration about the use of the
irreversible Michaelis-Menten equation for describing other than initial kinetic behavior of many
enzymes, but the reversible Michaelis-Menten equation is of course correct and can be derived
analytically for a model that is consistent with Microscopic Reversibility".

The author claims that the expression for the rate at the bottom of Table 2 is consistent with the
paper of Boudart - it is not. The author has left out the "chi's" in Eq. 3 of Boudart. Terrell Hill's
diagrammatic method (chapter 1 of Free Energy Transduction in Biology) of working out the rate
for simple cyclic reactions seems simpler to me. At any rate, this is all very standard stuff.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
The author presents a "minimal model" of facilitated diffusion based on reaction kinetics with
four steps. Its behavior in biologically relevant scenarios is analyzed. Special mention deserves
the comparison to Michaelis-Menten, the commonly used paradigm for enzymatic reactions. The
model is based on rates that fulfill detailed balance condition ( referred to as Second Law
constraints) which ensures that the final distribution would correctly describe thermal
equilibrium at temperature T and is thermodynamically consistent. It is also valid out of
equilibrium (different A concentrations in each compartment).
On the other hand, there are several very important issues that in my opinion should be
addressed by the author and therefore I cannot recommend publication in its present form. I list
them here:
1) The steady state of the system of equations admits an analytical solution. In fact, it is quite
straightforward to obtain with a symbolic computation software and, although probably lengthy
by hand, it is completely feasible to compute analytical formulas. It amounts to compute the 0
eigenvector of the 4x4 matrix representing the linear system of equations. This allows, for
example, to obtain a formula for the unidirectional rate. The final analytical formula can be cast
indeed in a quite simple manner after the particular cases (k1=10^7, k2=10^4, etc...) are
substituted. With the formula at hand, some of the apparently surprising results are easy to prove
(see below) and some may be proven with some more effort. I thus think it is really worth stating
the formula in the main text (with maybe details in an appendix).
5
2) The apparently mysterious symmetry of log(A1) with the free energy difference (DG0binding)
is easy to prove with the analytical formulas discussed in point 1), and it is indeed an exact
symmetry. It can be shown, (and after some thought, it can also be shown in the initial state
equations) that A1 (or A2) plays exactly the same role as Exp(DG0binding) in the unidirectional
rate. The isokine discussion may profit also from this analytical point of view. It is probably more
valuable for the reader to discuss the behavior of the system in light of the analytical formula
than a discussion based on a succession of numerical values. Furthermore, this numerical values
strongly depend on the parameters chosen, whereas conclusions drawn from the analytical
formula may be of more general application.
3) Despite the efforts of the author to justify it, I strongly disagree with the alleged necessity for
the number of digits for numerical values given in the manuscript. This is for two reasons:
-First, contrary to what it is stated, a large number of digits does not imply a high accuracy. To
give just one example, in section 1.Rapid equilibration Across a Barrier, in Table 3, the value of
DG0binding at which unidirectional rate attains its maximum is given as 0.000434106. This value
arises as a numerical solution of an equation. Any numerical solver will solve an equation to a
degree of accuracy stated by some Tolerance. So the precision depends on the tolerance setting. In
fact, this value can be given analytically (see first point) and turns out to be
DG=0.5*log((k1+2k2)/k1)/log(10) (log denotes natural logarithm here). Substituting k1=10^7 and
k2=10^4, this gives DG=0.00043386. The discrepancy (although not relevant for experiments) is
obvious and reveals that the last digits given in the table are absolutely meaningless. Thus, many
digits do not automatically mean high accuracy.
-Second, whether results are analytical, numerical or experimental it makes absolutely no sense to
give them with a much larger number of decimal places than the data in the beginning. As an
example, k1 is given as 10^7 M, a middle-order value, concentrations as 1 femtomolar (as
opposed to 1.0000 femtomolar), etc...
This makes absolute sense to me. However, to assume that any result obtained with these
numbers is precise up to more than a few digits is not correct. In different words, to state that
something happens at exactly 49.9750010855% for instance is completely meaningless. This must
be corrected throughout the paper.
4) It is stated that Michaelis-Menten model fundamental problem is that it cannot deal with
reversibility. Is the author referring to the irreversible catalytic step ES-> E+P ? I understand this
is a simplification valid when kf>>kb (the reaction rate for the forward reaction is much larger
than the reaction rate for the backward reaction). This may arise for example from a very large
DG (Gibbs free energy difference) compared to RT. Consequently, this considered "flaw" can be
easily overcome by allowing a finite backward reaction rate (E+P -> ES). Is this model
fundamentally different from the author's model with four steps? I think not. Surely it
complicates the solution with respect to traditional Michaelis-Menten, but just slightly so and it is
actually simpler than the proposed 4 step model (it can be described by 2 equations instead of 4).
Please comment on this point
.
5) Although less important than previous points, I would like to comment that these kind of
systems with master equations and rates obeying kf=kb*Exp(DeltaG) are quite common in
biological modelling (voltage gating models for example). I agree nevertheless that this approach
may give some valuable insights lacking in the more traditional way of looking at enzyme
kinetics.
6) Finally, I assume the unidirectional forward rate is r1r2r3r4/Denominator. Is this correct? It is
never defined (some numerical values are given but it is not defined). Although it can be guessed,
I think it should be clearer for the reader if the definition is given, for example in Table 2.

Decision letter 1 (RSOS-170041)
30-Mar-2017
Dear Dr Chapman:
I write you in regards to manuscript RSOS-170041 entitled "A MINIMAL MODEL OF
FACILITATED DIFFUSION CONSTRAINED BY THE PROBABILITY ISOTHERM: AN
EXERCISE IN INTUITIVE NON-EQUILIBRIUM THERMODYNAMICS (INET)" which you
submitted to Royal Society Open Science.
Regrettably, in view of the criticisms of the reviewers and editors, found at the bottom of this
letter, your manuscript has been rejected for publication. Whilst a number of positives are
identified in the work by the referees, the general view appears to be that it is, unfortunately, of
insufficiently high-quality and lacking the degree of advance required for publication in the
journal.
We understand that this decision may be disappointing, though we wish you well if you choose
to submit your work elsewhere.
Thank you for considering Royal Society Open Science for the publication of your research. I
hope this decision will not discourage you from submitting manuscripts in the future.
Yours sincerely,
Andrew Dunn

Dear Brian,
Thank you for your email, which came through to the Royal Society Open Science inbox.
Following an initial assessment of your concerns, I can see that you have a number of rebuttal
points in response to the reviewers' feedback. In light of your comments therefore, I was
wondering whether you were hoping to appeal the final decision for your submission? If so, in
this scenario, the best course of action would be for us to treat your case as a formal appeal.
Appeals require a point-by-point scientific rebuttal to the rejection decision, but since you have
already provided a response of sorts, we will be happy to consider your comments as your
rebuttal file in this case.
Appeals are then communicated to the relevant Editor, who will make one of the three decisions
10
with respect to the appeal:
1) The rejection is upheld;
2) The rejection is overturned, and a resubmission is invited;
3) The rejection is overturned, and the manuscript is published ‘as is’.
In any case, the Editor’s decision is considered final, as is the outcome of the appeal, and in the
event that the rejection is upheld, no additional correspondence will be conducted as the matter
will be considered closed.
In light of this information, I would be grateful if you could let me know whether you would like
to officially appeal your decision. If so, please let me know and I can pass your comments onto
your handling editor right away.
Kind Regards,
Alice

Appendix A
03 April 2017
Dear Mr Dunn:
Thank you for your letter of March 30th last, informing me of the rejection of my manuscript RSOS-
170041.
While I am disappointed by this rejection, I am most grateful to you for not only engaging the
services of no fewer than four Reviewers, but for also securing from most of them fully detailed
comments lending support to your decision. This has been a particularly generous allocation of
resources on the part of RSOS and is much appreciated by me, particularly as this was a second
attempt to publish under the same title, material that you had previously rejected following the
reports of two Reviewers several months earlier.
As you point out, a number of positives have been identified but I accept that these have been
overwhelmed by the consistent complaint that my results, though completely correct, are trivial,
well-known, unremarkable, etc.. These reasonable criticisms emphasise that my paper is essentially
pedagogical in intent and probably should not have been submitted to RSOS in the first place.
However, I should not have chosen to submit such a pedagogical paper to RSOS had I not had the
surprising experience of being required by a Reviewer of my RSOS research publication with A/Prof
Denis Loiselle - "Thermodynamics and Kinetics of the FoF1-ATPase: Application of the Probability
Isotherm" (R. Soc. open sci. 2016 3 150379; DOI: 10.1098/rsos.150379. Published 10 February 2016)
- to include a pedagogical section on the distinction between entropy creation and entropy
exchange. Perhaps my four present Reviewers would also find our published thoughts on entropy
creation/exchange to be absolutely nothing new, being totally unsurprising to anyone, or being all
very standard stuff from which the typical RSOS reader could learn nothing. At any rate, that is the
reason why my intendedly pedagogical paper was submitted to RSOS; I accept that this was
probably a mistake, but a very helpful mistake from my point of view, given the useful feedback
received.
While I acknowledge gratefully the time and effort which RSOS and the four Reviewers have given in
consideration of my paper, I should point out that they all missed the quite transparent error in
Table 7 on p.23; this Table was constructed by Copy & Paste procedures, and the values for log[A]2
in the middle column were all mistakenly left at a constant value of -4.35 whereas they should all
have been set at values exactly 2 units more negative than the respective log[A]1 values for 100-fold
concentration differences. I apologise for this error, but it is clearly the kind of error that is quite
easily missed by Authors and Reviewers alike, particularly by Reviewers who have already been
amply wearied by my "endless discussion" and imagined need for unheard of levels of numerical
precision.
I now turn to address the remarks of the Reviewers individually.
Reviewer 1:
My impression is that this Reviewer is on a different wavelength with a lofty biophysical research
perspective from which there's no perception of the basic pedagogical problems that infect the
teaching and learning of bioenergetics and spread from there into the research literature (I refer the
Reviewer to my two 2011 pedagogical papers at
https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/IISME/article/view/4801 and
https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/IISME/article/view/4818 and the
abovementioned pedagogical section at
http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/search/probability%252Bisotherm%20jcode%3Aroyopensci).
I've clearly failed to convey anything useful to this Reviewer and, for my part, I have learnt nothing
from this Reviewer's comments.
Reviewer 2:
Although this Reviewer asserted, "I have objections on the new approach proposed, INET, as a
definitive theory to treat facilitated diffusion processes", no objections or reasons for objection were
elaborated. As it stands, the statement is utterly uninformative.
This Reviewer then went to say, "Although non-equilibrium thermodynamics only applies to the
linear flux-force regime" - hold it right there! - that is precisely the beginning and the end of LNET,
and it is probably one of the most barren intellectual impostures that has ever attempted to force
itself into the scientific consciousness. While linear force-flux relations may be of use to electricians
and plumbers, they are utterly inapplicable to any form of chemistry, even biochemistry! That so
much of the biotransport literature is littered with speculations and genuflections toward LNET is
both a tragedy and a disgrace. LNETters are commonly silent or vague on the extent or domain of
applicability of their "regime" but it is sufficient to observe that any portion of a sine wave may be
approximated by a straight line - the point is, what is the operative domain of acceptable
approximation? It is almost never discussed, let alone given quantitative expression. And what on
earth is the value of a phenomenological coefficient in aiding any understanding of mechanism? The
entire LNET literature is a fraud, in my opinion, and I see no reason why anyone should be forced to
read it. When has LNET ever produced anything genuinely informative or insightful about the
mechanisms or energetics of biotransport processes? What useful and testable predictions has it
uniquely made? Nonetheless, in appreciation for this Reviewer's kindness in seeking to help me by
giving me two references on "mesoscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamics" (MNET, presumably?)
to follow up, I shall do so and report back through you if I find them helpful.
Reviewer 3:
This Reviewer states, "The author provides nice, colorful graphs of the results for various possible
and plausible parameter choices using MatLab." No, they were produced using ToolBook in dynamic
data exchange with Excel, the latter's algorithms being used for primarily solving the system of linear
equations and making the secondary calculations as stated on pp.4-5. MatLab was used elsewhere
(as Acknowledged) to check on the accuracy of my ToolBook/Excel methods when the apparent
need for high numerical precision was first perceived. Once the cross-check was performed,
everything was trusted to the ToolBook/Excel regime.
While this Reviewer appears to concur (using expressions such as "bad papers", "foolishness",
"stupid and incorrect papers", etc.) with the kinds of errors that I'm attempting to clear up, the
problem is that my paper contains nothing scientifically new. I accept that completely. The paper is
an attempt to offer a new pedagogy to educate scientists in ways that might facilitate and improve
the design and interpretation of experiments, nothing more, nothing less.
This Reviewer writes, "The author claims that the expression for the rate at the bottom of Table 2 is
consistent with the paper of Boudart - it is not. The author has left out the "chi's" in Eq. 3 of
Boudart." I'm afraid that the Reviewer has misunderstood or overlooked the fact that the "chi"s are
STOICHIOMETRIC NUMBERS, which I have tacitly assumed (inescapably, given my 4-step model) to
be unity. I apologise for being cavalier about this but, given the assumed value of unity, there is no
inconsistency between my formulation for my particular model and the generality of Boudart's
formulation. Nonetheless, I should have stated this assumption overtly to avoid misunderstanding.
Reviewer 4:
I'm particularly grateful to this Reviewer for the clear and extensive comments and for the six
enumerated points for suggested improvement to this paper. On the surface I find all six points
helpful and worthy of attention. Once I have worked thoroughly through all these suggestions I
should like to write, through you, a fuller letter of appreciation to this Reviewer.
Meanwhile, I completely agree with this Reviewer's comment #5 and point out that I was one of the
early contributors in this field, having published in 1980 an application of the Probability Isotherm
(without calling it that) to re-interpreting the kinetics of m, n and h in the Hodgkin-Huxley equations
(see Reference 16 on p.27).
Again, my thanks to you and the Reviewers for all the effort expended in consideration of my work.
Best wishes,
Associate Professor Brian Chapman, PhD
Appendix B
April 28th, 2017
Dear Mr Dunn:
Further to our correspondence of three weeks ago, I hereby submit my appeal against the decision to
reject my manuscript RSOS-170041, and this appeal should displace entirely my earlier letter to you
of April 3rd last which was written in ignorance of the fact that the present appeal might be possible.
For completeness, this current letter will repeat many of my earlier statements. This appeal is made
on the understanding that you conveyed to me, i.e., that the frankly pedagogical nature of this paper
(now clarified through amended Title, Running Title, Abstract and Introduction) does not place it
outside the scope of RSOS. However, I question whether the paper might not fit more the ‘type’
description of “Perspective” rather than “Research”. I leave this matter to your judgment.
While I was disappointed by the rejection (against which I am now appealing), I remain most grateful
to you for not only engaging the services of no fewer than four Reviewers, but for also securing from
most of them fully detailed comments lending support to your decision. This has been a particularly
generous allocation of resources on the part of RSOS and is much appreciated by me, particularly as
this was a second attempt to publish under the same title, material that you had previously rejected
following the reports of two Reviewers several months earlier.
As you point out, a number of positives have been identified but I accept that these have been
overwhelmed by the consistent complaint that my results, though completely correct, are trivial, well-
known, unremarkable, etc.. These reasonable criticisms emphasise that my paper is essentially
pedagogical in intent, an intent that I have now made sufficiently clear in the new Title, Running Title,
Abstract and Introduction; the intent is to reform the current thermodynamic and kinetic approaches
to the design and interpretation of experiments on membrane transport processes. In particular, I
believe that the traditional approaches of irreversible or reversible Michaelis-Menten Kinetics (MMK)
on the one hand, or Linear Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics (LNET) on the other, are wastefully
simplistic and wastefully misleading, respectively.
Please note that:
• All page numbers and Figure numbers referenced in this letter apply to the amended paper
submitted herewith;
• The original Section 10 – Effects of varying substrate concentration at constant
thermodynamic force – has been deleted, along with its original Table 7 and Figure 13. Its
content has been reduced to a single sentence in a footnote on p.16;
• The original Figure 2 has been deleted and so all remaining Figures except Figure 1 are re-
numbered accordingly.
I now turn to address the remarks of the Reviewers individually.
Reviewer 1:
The author studied a mathematical model of transportation across a membrane (Eqs (1) to (4)) numerically
Correct
and the paper consists largely of discussions of how the rate constants affect the transport kinetics.
This does not acknowledge that the variation of the rate constants was done ‘thermodynamically’ by
varying the binding affinities. Nor does it acknowledge that these variations were complemented by
variations of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium substrate concentrations.
As a biological physicist who publishes regularly in mainstream physics and biology journals, I do not see what the
contribution of this paper is to these communities. In my opinion, the paper is a lengthy elaboration of various numerical
analyses of a relatively simple set of equation.
It is indeed lengthy, compounded by an unjustified venture into unheard of levels of numerical
precision that are now pared down to the minimum required. The equations are relatively simple,
indeed, but the conclusions I have drawn from my numerical simulations cut across the conventional
wisdoms attaching to both MMK and LNET. Therefore, my conclusions represent a pertinent and
urgent challenge to these outmoded methods that result in unnecessarily lower standards of design
and interpretation of experiments.
I do not think I have learned anything from reading this paper.
This is a shame for which I must accept much, but not all, of the blame.
Indeed, I still do not know what intuitive non-equilibrium thermodynamics means even though it is in the title of the paper.
My impression is that this Reviewer has little perception of the basic pedagogical problems that infect
the teaching and learning of bioenergetics and spread from there into the research literature (I refer
the Reviewer to my two 2011 pedagogical papers at
https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/IISME/article/view/4801 and
https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/IISME/article/view/4818 and the pedagogical
section requested by one of the Reviewers of a previous research paper of mine at
http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/search/probability%252Bisotherm%20jcode%3Aroyopensci).
Reviewer 2:
This article proposes a facilitated diffusion model to describe the translocation of a substance across a
membrane mediated by an enzyme. The model uses the law of mass action to formulate a set of differential
equations for the evolution in time of the concentrations of the substance at both sides of the membrane
and of the two conformations of the enzyme.
This is a correct summary as far as it goes, but it omits to mention that the differential equations ‘for
the evolution in time’ were all equated to zero, given that only steady-state scenarios were simulated
and discussed.
It is pointed out that the intrinsic nonlinear nature of the law of mass action restricts the application of
classical nonequilibrium thermodynamics which only provides linear flux-force relationships.
Correct. But, of course, it is far worse than that. The saturability of enzyme-catalysed reactions is yet
another source of nonlinearity in force-flux relations, compounding the already inescapable nonlinear
consequences of the Law of Mass Action. I have inserted this comment into the section on Force-Flux
Relations (p.16).
An alternative approach, called intuitive non-equilibrium thermodynamics, is proposed.
Correct.
The model proposed and the solution of the differential equations are correct.
Thank you for this confirmation.
I have objections on the new approach proposed, INET, as a definitive theory to treat facilitated diffusion
processes.
No objections or reasons for objection are evident. As it stands, the statement is quite uninformative.
Although non-equilibrium thermodynamics only applies to the linear flux-force regime,
LNET-ers are commonly silent or vague on the extent or domain of applicability of their "linear flux-
force regime", but it is sufficient to observe that any portion of a sine wave may be approximated by
a straight line – the point is, what is the operative domain of acceptable approximation? It is almost
never discussed, let alone given quantitative expression. I have inserted related commentary into the
section on Force-Flux relations (p.16).
an extension to the mesoscale, referred to as mesoscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamics, can describe
chemical and biochemical reactions in the non-linear domain; see the feature article: The mesoscopic
dynamics of thermodynamic systems, J Phys. Chem. B, 109, 21502 (2005); and the article: Physica A, 237, 205
(1997).
It was kind of this Reviewer to give me two references on "mesoscopic non-equilibrium
thermodynamics" (MNET) to follow up. However, I am convinced that no extension of a
formulation from micro- to meso- to macro-scale can legitimise a basically ill-guided
formulation. In particular, I fundamentatlly disagree with the following statement quoted from
p.21503 of the feature article (J.Phys.Chem. B, 109, 21502, 2005 …
2. Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics
Nonequilibrium thermodynamics is a well-established classical discipline built on the grounds of two main
hypotheses. First, the local equilibrium hypothesis assumes that the thermodynamic variables defined in each
subsystem of a conveniently partitioned system admit the same interpretation as in equilibrium.
Is this ‘hypothesis’ the same as the requirement for microscopic Boltzmann equilibrium which
is satisfied in liquid-phase reactions in which reaction times are effectively longer than 10-11 s as
now included in the Introduction on p.3 (see, for example, Porter G. Transfer and Storage of Chemical and
Radiation Potential. Journal of the Chemical Society, Faraday Transactions 2. 1983;79:473-82)? If so, this is
simply an experimental fact of life working in favour of extending thermodynamic laws from
equilibrium states to non-equilibrium states at the macroscopic level, i.e., precisely the kind of
application of the Probability Isotherm to the interpretation of force-flux relations that I am
developing in the present paper as an example of Intuitive Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics
(INET).
Second, the entropy production of any isolated system is always nonnegative.
… except at equilibrium! This is one of the many possible ways of expressing the Second Law,
which most of us accept as dogma with inductive faith (i.e., more than an hypothesis).
A very real and present problem is that, from the outset of modern biochemical pedagogy, LNET has
been admitted as a consultant, causing even Lehninger to become confused by Katchalsky into saying
on successive pages of his classical textbook that “living cells … are never totally in equilibrium” and
“Living cells … exist in steady states, far from equilibrium” (see the second page of Chapman B, Mosse J, Larkins
J-a. The probability isotherm: an intuitive non-equilibrium thermodynamic framework for biochemical kinetics. Proceedings
of the Australian Conference on Science and Mathematics Education. 2011).
LNET-ers always seem to want to have it both ways – ‘close to equilibrium’ to justify (incorrectly) their
assumption of linear force-flux relations, and ‘far from equilibrium’ to justify (again, incorrectly) their
claimed relevance to non-equilibrium living processes.
I remain utterly persuaded that no thermodynamic force-flux relations in biotransport can ever
deviate from the strictures prescribed by the Probability Isotherm or the nonlinearity determined by
the Mass Action Law on the one hand and by the saturability of carrier-mediated transport on the
other. No matter at which conceptual level one operates – whether micro, meso or macro – the
macroscopic result cannot violate the Second Law as expressed through the Probability Isotherm, and
there is no sophistication of statistical mechanics or molecular biology that can overturn it.
Reviewer 3:
This paper is about endless discussion of the results of solving the steady-state kinetic equations on page 4
for the four state transport model shown on page 2 as Eqs. (1), (2), (3), and (4).
I apologise for the ‘endless’ quality of the discussion/presentation, aggravated by the excessive
numerical precision used. I have removed the original Figures 2 and 13 and tempered the
numerical precision.
The analytic solution to these equations is well known and involves solving simultaneous equations for four
variables with one additional constraint (constant total concentration of the transporter).
Correct (in relation to the primary problem of solving the four independent linear equations).
The author provides nice, colorful graphs of the results for various possible and plausible parameter choices
using MatLab.
No, they were produced using ToolBook in dynamic data exchange with Excel, the latter's algorithms
being used for primarily solving the system of linear equations and making the secondary calculations
as stated on p.8. MatLab was used elsewhere in another laboratory (as Acknowledged) to check on
the accuracy of my ToolBook/Excel methods when the apparent need for high numerical precision
was first perceived. Once the cross-check was performed successfully, everything was trusted to the
ToolBook/Excel regime.
The author provides values for the rate of transport both as a table, and in the text, with - COUNT THEM -
ten significant figures. This illustrates one of the problems of the digital age.
I accept that my reasons for pursuing such precision were misguided. Clearly, the overall effect
was unhelpful and I apologise for the resulting tiresomeness.
The basic message of the paper seems to me to be that applications of solutions obtained by approximations
to kinetic equations should not be applied to situations where those approximations are not valid. OK, I will
agree.
If by ‘approximations’ the Reviewer is referring to MMK, then we are in agreement. However,
the linear force-flux assumptions of LNET are not – conceptually, theoretically or experimentally
– legitimate ‘approximations’ to real biotransport behaviour; on the contrary, they are totally
at odds with the Law of Mass Action and the saturability of enzymes, to say nothing of possible
voltage-dependence of enzyme activity, etc..
Further, I recognize that there are many bad papers in the literature where this foolishness is in fact done,
but that not justify publishing a paper without new intellectual content.
It is unfortunate that the presentation of my argument has been mistakenly perceived as an
attempt to present new intellectual content (i.e., new ‘findings’). The intent was always
pedagogical and, relying solely on the Law of Mass Action and the Second Law of
Thermodynamics, it offers no new theory whatsoever. The intent is to show that an INTUITIVE
application of the Mass Action and Second Laws to both Equilibrium and Non-Equilibrium
scenarios in facilitated diffusion yields results and their interpretation that find MMK and LNET
wanting, to say the least. I am hoping that my change of Title and Running Title, and revised
Abstract and Introduction have remedied this.
Let me be very clear - this entire paper is based on a model that can be analytically solved for all intermediate
transporter concentrations and hence for all rates.
Correct. However, this description could be more precise (in view of issues raised by Reviewer
4). The analytical solution for all intermediate transporter concentrations was obtained by
using the algorithms built into Excel to solve for the four unknown enzyme concentrations – E1,
E1A, E2A and E2; this is the primary analytical solution of the four linear state equations (which
Excel delivers numerically). But the further calculations of unidirectional and net rates at each
step, enzyme saturation, free energy dissipation at each step and overall – these are all
secondary calculations using simple algebraic formula expressed numerically, also performed
within Excel. I make this distinction to differentiate these solutions and calculations from the
tertiary issues pertaining to the shapes of (a) equilibrium unidirectional reaction rate curves
varying with substrate concentration or binding affinity, (b) non-equilibrium force-flux relations
or (c) the equilibrium isokines, for all of which, at present, I do not believe there are helpful
analytical solutions (but I’d welcome being disabused of that belief).
There is absolutely nothing new here, and I cannot imagine anyone being surprised by any of the results.
Well, I suppose that different people have different thresholds for surprise. I imagine that
Gräber and coworkers (see References 18-20 of the paper) ought to be surprised by some of the
results presented, or should at least question their interpretative rationale based on belief in
the relevance of LNET.
The authors claimed justification for publishing is that some people publish stupid and incorrect papers in
the literature, a claim that is perfectly true but does not justify publishing what amounts to a homework
assignment.
“Homework assignment” is a very apt description of this paper’s content and intent. The problem is
that far too few people have done their homework. While this Reviewer appears to concur (using
expressions such as "bad papers", "foolishness", "stupid and incorrect papers", etc.) with my
assessment of the kinds of errors that I'm attempting to clear up, the more fundamental problem for
this Reviewer seems to be that my paper contains nothing scientifically new. I accept that completely.
The paper is an attempt to offer a new pedagogy to educate scientists in ways that might facilitate
and improve the design and interpretation of experiments in biotransport, nothing more, nothing less.
I hope the revised Title, Running Title. Abstract and Introduction will help here.
I have some sympathy with the authors frustration about the use of the irreversible Michaelis-Menten
equation for describing other than initial kinetic behavior of many enzymes, but the reversible Michaelis-
Menten equation is of course correct and can be derived analytically for a model that is consistent with
Microscopic Reversibility".
I disagree that the reversible M-M equation is ‘correct’ for my simulated scenarios, or for any scenarios
in biotransport that involve diffusion-limited binding/dissociation of ligands on the one hand, and
protein conformational changes on the other. It depends on the chosen level of simplification at which
reversible MMK is developed, i.e., reversible 2-step (E + S = ES = E + P), reversible 3-step (E + S = ES =
EP = E + P) or reversible 4-step as in the present paper (E1 + S1 = E1S = E2S = E2 + S2; E2 = E1). My main
pedagogical position is that graphical illustration of straightforward steady-state numerical solutions
– of fundamental equations derived directly from the Law of Mass Action which are valid under all
conditions, whether steady state or not, and whether equilibrium or not – highlights the model’s
behaviour in ways that are more clearly and intuitively revealed than by reliance on displayed algebra.
I have mentioned above the need for an improved pedagogy to inform researchers in biotransport.
The author claims that the expression for the rate at the bottom of Table 2 is consistent with the paper of
Boudart - it is not. The author has left out the "chi's" in Eq. 3 of Boudart.
The Reviewer may have misunderstood or overlooked the fact that Boudart’s "chi"s are stoichiometric
numbers, which I have tacitly assumed (inescapably, given my 4-step model) to be unity. I apologise
for being cavalier about this but, given the assumed value of unity, there is no inconsistency between
my formulation for my particular model and the generality of Boudart's formulation. Nonetheless, I
should have stated this assumption overtly to avoid misunderstanding. This is now remedied on p.8.
Terrell Hill's diagrammatic method (chapter 1 of Free Energy Transduction in Biology) of working out the rate
for simple cyclic reactions seems simpler to me.
That’s fair enough, and is a matter of personal taste. I find my INET approach simpler.
At any rate, this is all very standard stuff.
Agreed. This is a pedagogical paper pertaining to ‘very standard stuff’, the relevance of which to
research in biotransport has been obscured by the inappropriate intrusion of LNET.
Reviewer 4:
The author presents a "minimal model" of facilitated diffusion based on reaction kinetics with four steps. Its
behavior in biologically relevant scenarios is analyzed. Special mention deserves the comparison to Michaelis-
Menten, the commonly used paradigm for enzymatic reactions. The model is based on rates that fulfill
detailed balance condition ( referred to as Second Law constraints) which ensures that the final distribution
would correctly describe thermal equilibrium at temperature T and is thermodynamically consistent. It is also
valid out of equilibrium (different A concentrations in each compartment).
On the other hand, there are several very important issues that in my opinion should be addressed by the
author and therefore I cannot recommend publication in its present form. I list them here:
I'm particularly grateful to this Reviewer for the clear and extensive comments and for the six
enumerated points for suggested improvement to this paper.
1) The steady state of the system of equations admits an analytical solution. In fact, it is quite straightforward
to obtain with a symbolic computation software and, although probably lengthy by hand, it is completely
feasible to compute analytical formulas. It amounts to compute the 0 eigenvector of the 4x4 matrix
representing the linear system of equations.
I believe that I have used the analytical solution, not by programming it directly into my
simulation code (although this was tested as a cross-check on accuracy, but then discarded
because of its relative slowness), but by trusting Excel’s algorithms to obtain it and express the
results numerically as obtained from my numerical input of parameters, constants and
variables. This is what, for the sake of clarity, I should call the primary analytical solution, i.e.,
the solution that simply evaluates the distribution of the four enzyme forms (see also above
comments in response to Reviewer 3).
This allows, for example, to obtain a formula for the unidirectional rate.
This is what I should call a secondary analytical solution for evaluating the unidirectional
reaction rates at each step. It is obtained directly by applying the Mass Action Law (MAL) to the
primary analytical solution for the four enzyme forms, along with the input parameters,
constants and variables. From these individual secondary analytical solutions the Overall
secondary analytical solutions for the overall rates are calculated according to the method of
Boudart as shown in Table 2. Further calculations of secondary analytical solutions were
performed to obtain the enzyme saturation, the net rate and the free energy dissipation at each
step (and their “Overall” counterparts). All these primary and secondary calculations were
performed within Excel. The advantage of using Excel in this way is that the whole chemical
simulation is displayed intuitively in the Excel spreadsheet (provided as Electronic
Supplementary Material), and it proved to be faster than using the controlling software
(ToolBook) to perform the calculations, provided that the open Excel file was kept minimised
during the sweeping of the independent variable(s).
The final analytical formula can be cast indeed in a quite simple manner after the particular cases (k1=10^7,
k2=10^4, etc...) are substituted. With the formula at hand, some of the apparently surprising results are easy
to prove (see below) and some may be proven with some more effort. I thus think it is really worth stating
the formula in the main text (with maybe details in an appendix).
I fear, though doubting my understanding of the situation, that we may be at cross purposes
here (see also my response to point 6 below). The ‘surprising’ results referred to are
presumably those that pertain to the shapes and points of maxima of the overall unidirectional
equilibrium rates and the ‘symmetry’ disclosed (Figures 2 and 3 and Tables 3 and 4). These are
what I should call tertiary solutions; note that I don’t, at this stage, call them tertiary analytical
solutions because I’m not yet convinced that there are helpful analytical solutions at this tertiary
level (which is not to claim that calculus can’t be used to determine the maxima analytically).
2) The apparently mysterious symmetry of log(A1) with the free energy difference (DG0binding) is easy to
prove with the analytical formulas discussed in point 1), and it is indeed an exact symmetry. It can be shown,
(and after some thought, it can also be shown in the initial state equations) that A1 (or A2) plays exactly the
same role as Exp(DG0binding) in the unidirectional rate.
There were two ‘mysteries’ in play, or so I thought when I wrote the paper. The first ‘mystery’
was the failure of the overall unidirectional rates to peak at exactly the unit of log[A] or <U+F044>GoBinding
that I had expected (i.e., corresponding to the 50% saturation points). The second ‘mystery’
was the ‘symmetry’ observed in this ‘mysterious’ behaviour between the consequences of
varying log[A] or varying <U+F044>GoBinding. I thank the Reviewer for what seems to be a clarification of
the ‘mystery’ of the ‘symmetry’ (i.e., the second ‘mystery’). I have modified my presentation
and discussion of these data accordingly (pp.10-13).
However, I remain at a loss to know exactly what the Reviewer means by the “analytical
formulas discussed in point 1)”. The analytical formula for the four enzyme forms is one thing
(the primary solution). Substituting these enzyme forms into analytical formulae for the
unidirectional rates at each step is another (secondary solutions). Substituting these
unidirectional rates into Boudart’s formulae for the overall rates is yet another (more secondary
solutions). Differentiating Boudart’s rate formula with respect to log[A] or <U+F044>GoBinding would seem
to take us to a point at which we would be confronted by an unhelpful avalanche of algebra and
would be no longer at an intuitive advantage over the LNET-ers or the more esoteric MMK-ers.
I accept the possibility that I may not understand the Reviewer correctly, but, for the present, I
find the numerical simulation methods that I’ve chosen more intuitively tractable and
illustrative.
The isokine discussion may profit also from this analytical point of view.
I accept that this would be a real possibility if my apparent misunderstanding of the Reviewer’s
comments could be cleared up. Nonetheless, I have modified my comments leading up to and
including the isokines in recognition of the less ‘mysterious’ nature of the symmetry as pointed
out by the Reviewer.
It is probably more valuable for the reader to discuss the behavior of the system in light of the analytical
formula than a discussion based on a succession of numerical values. Furthermore, this numerical values
strongly depend on the parameters chosen, whereas conclusions drawn from the analytical formula may be
of more general application.
This may be a matter of personal taste. I much prefer to view graphical illustration of kinetic
behaviour than complex algebra. I accept that my numerical data (especially given their
containing unheard of numbers of significant figures) have been presented unhelpfully and
shouldn’t have been used anywhere near to that extent, but the absolute numerical values are
unimportant compared with their variation as displayed graphically. I should suggest that the
shapes of the graphs are no less sound a basis for drawing conclusions than would be the
“analytical formula” (if only I knew which such formula was being contemplated).
3) Despite the efforts of the author to justify it, I strongly disagree with the alleged necessity for the number
of digits for numerical values given in the manuscript. This is for two reasons:
-First, contrary to what it is stated, a large number of digits does not imply a high accuracy. To give just one
example, in section 1.Rapid equilibration Across a Barrier, in Table 3, the value of DG0binding at which
unidirectional rate attains its maximum is given as 0.000434106. This value arises as a numerical solution of
an equation. Any numerical solver will solve an equation to a degree of accuracy stated by some Tolerance.
So the precision depends on the tolerance setting. In fact, this value can be given analytically (see first point)
and turns out to be DG=0.5*log((k1+2k2)/k1)/log(10) (log denotes natural logarithm here). Substituting
k1=10^7 and k2=10^4, this gives DG=0.00043386. The discrepancy (although not relevant for experiments)
is obvious and reveals that the last digits given in the table are absolutely meaningless. Thus, many digits do
not automatically mean high accuracy.
While I agree that my use of high numerical precision was misguided, unnecessary and
extremely unhelpful, I must disagree with much of the foregoing paragraph. I think there is
room for discussion here. The solutions to numerically solved equations may be extended to
the limit of precision of the machine (in my case, a Microsoft Surface Pro using Windows 10).
Comparable machines will generate identical solutions to the nth decimal place of choice (within
the machines’ specifications) and, from my teasing out manually the exact positions of Rmax in
my Figures 2 and 3 (as reported in Tables 3 and 4), I can say with complete assurance that the
numbers 0.000434106 and 0.00043386 cannot possibly be solutions to the same problem or
situation.
Moreover, I cannot understand the Reviewer’s analytical expression
<U+F0E6> k <U+F02B> 2k2 <U+F0F6>
ln<U+F0E7> 1 <U+F0F7>
<U+F0E8> k1 <U+F0F8>
<U+F044>GBinding <U+F03D>
0
ln(10)
Is this an analytical solution for the value of <U+F044>GoBinding at which unidirectional Rmax occurs in my
(now renumbered) Figure 2? If so, then its numerical value differs very much from what my
methods produce when I alter k2 to values other than 104 s-1, i.e., much greater than the ‘near
miss’ between 0.000434106 and 0.00043386. I am prepared to believe that this Reviewer may
be correct in proffering the above analytical formula, but I cannot see it at present. I’m moved
to suspect that, if the formula itself doesn’t actually contain a ‘typo’ as presented, that perhaps
it was derived from some MMK type of simplified model. When reflecting upon just the Boudart
formula alone, I do not see how the above formula, containing only two of the eight rate
coefficients in the 4-step model, could possibly be correct.
So my provisional position here is that the Reviewer may have made a mistake. If not, then I
need to be pointed in the right direction. May I be given the derivation of the above formula
from my model’s basic kinetic equations (the full algebraic derivation, please)? Is there some
well-known pedagogical source that lays out these kinds of analytical solutions of which I’m
clearly unaware? If so, then I should welcome coming to this knowledge and applying it to yet
another revision of my paper.
Meanwhile, I’ve reduced all numerical precision reported to being no more than four decimal
places (except where 5 are necessary as in column 2 of each of Tables 3 and 4).
-Second, whether results are analytical, numerical or experimental it makes absolutely no sense to give them
with a much larger number of decimal places than the data in the beginning. As an example, k1 is given as
10^7 M, a middle-order value, concentrations as 1 femtomolar (as opposed to 1.0000 femtomolar), etc...
This makes absolute sense to me. However, to assume that any result obtained with these numbers is precise
up to more than a few digits is not correct. In different words, to state that something happens at exactly
49.9750010855% for instance is completely meaningless. This must be corrected throughout the paper.
Subject to the above reservation, I agree completely and have altered the paper accordingly.
4) It is stated that Michaelis-Menten model fundamental problem is that it cannot deal with reversibility. Is
the author referring to the irreversible catalytic step ES-> E+P ? I understand this is a simplification valid
when kf>>kb (the reaction rate for the forward reaction is much larger than the reaction rate for the
backward reaction). This may arise for example from a very large DG (Gibbs free energy difference) compared
to RT. Consequently, this considered "flaw" can be easily overcome by allowing a finite backward reaction
rate (E+P -> ES). Is this model fundamentally different from the author's model with four steps? I think not.
Surely it complicates the solution with respect to traditional Michaelis-Menten, but just slightly so and it is
actually simpler than the proposed 4 step model (it can be described by 2 equations instead of 4). Please
comment on this point .
I welcome this opportunity. The preference for the 4-step model as a “minimal model” of
facilitated diffusion is that it does not rely on simplifying assumptions about the relative sizes
of rate coefficients or rates, and it is generalised such that there are no simplifying
approximations that would assuredly become invalid as one swept the independent variable(s)
over wide domains either side of thermodynamic equilibrium. The ability to conceive and
calculate the free energy dissipation at each step, using the Probability Isotherm, and thereby
gain a full functional perspective on the concepts of ‘rate limitation’ and/or ‘chemical
impedance’ at each step, is something quite outside the reach of MMK, but is simply matter of
course within the perspective of INET.
Nonetheless, I admit to overstating the ‘irreversibility’ issue in my references to MMK in the
paper and I have modified the discussion accordingly.
5) Although less important than previous points, I would like to comment that these kind of systems with
master equations and rates obeying kf=kb*Exp(DeltaG) are quite common in biological modelling (voltage
gating models for example).
I completely agree with this comment and I should point out that I was one of the early contributors
in this field, having published in 1980 an application of the Probability Isotherm (without calling it that)
to re-interpreting the kinetics of m, n and h in the Hodgkin-Huxley equations (see Reference 11 on p.27). I
have added a comment about voltage gating in the Introduction (p.3)
I agree nevertheless that this approach may give some valuable insights lacking in the more traditional way
of looking at enzyme kinetics.
I am very grateful for this comment, which synergises well with my rationale for promoting INET.
6) Finally, I assume the unidirectional forward rate is r1r2r3r4/Denominator. Is this correct? It is never defined
(some numerical values are given but it is not defined). Although it can be guessed, I think it should be clearer
for the reader if the definition is given, for example in Table 2.
I don’t quite understand the point at issue here. The Reviewer’s assumption is correct, yes. But the
overall unidirectional forward rate is defined in Table 2, precisely where the Reviewer suggests it
should be, in the “Overall” row of the “Forward” column. Was there corruption of this Table in
transmission to the Reviewers?
My paper stated, under the heading Mathematical Methods on p.4 originally and now on p.8, that:
These steady-state equations were solved using the algorithms built into Microsoft Excel, the
resulting concentrations of the four forms of the enzyme then being used to calculate the
unidirectional rates of each of the four reaction steps as given in Table 2. The formulae for calculating
the overall unidirectional rates were derived according the method given by Boudart (9).
I have now included the clarification of Boudart’s “chi”s and have inserted the words “as also given in
the “Overall” row of Table 2” at the end of the sentence.
Again, my thanks to the RSOS Editors and the Reviewers for all the effort expended in consideration
of my work.
