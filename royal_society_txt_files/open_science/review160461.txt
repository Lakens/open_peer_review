In this paper, Heaney and colleagues test the hypothesis that responses to inequity evolve in
species that cooperate by testing the kea, a highly social parrot that is not cooperative. They find
that keas are not sensitive to an experimental inequity task, supporting the hypothesis that it is
cooperation, and not sociality alone, that is the critical feature in the evolution of inequity
responses. This is a good choice of species to test this hypothesis and a nice addition to the
literature. I have a few comments to improve the paper.
Title: Right now the title doesn’t get across the importance of this work to testing hypotheses
about the relationship between cooperation and responses to inequity. Perhaps something like
“Keas’ lack of response to inequity supports the hypothesized link to cooperation”? It doesn’t
need to be this title, but something that better incorporates the main point of the manuscript.
Abstract: Somewhere in the abstract you need to provide information about the keas’ socio-
ecology (probably around lines 30/31). Otherwise the reader doesn’t know why this is an
appropriate species for testing this hypothesis.
Introduction: In general the introduction does a nice job of introducing the question, but it
doesn’t always flow smoothly. For example, in the second full paragraph of page 2, the focus is
initially only on the species that don’t respond to inequity. But there is evidence that several
species of macaques do so (Hopper, Lambeth, Schapiro, Bernacky, & Brosnan, 2013; Massen, Van
Den Berg, Spruijt, & Sterck, 2012). There are also several other studies showing that callithrichids
do not respond to inequity (Freeman et al., 2013; Neiworth, Johnson, Whillock, Greenberg, &
Brown, 2009), and likewise the cooperatively breeding owl monkey does not respond (Freeman
and colleagues). I don’t think you need to discuss the details of each study, but it is important to
set the stage for your discussion by better setting up the variability that is seen across species.
P1, line 52: See also (Brosnan & de Waal, 2014).
P2, line 6 – One hypothesis is that humans reject unequal offers in the UG because of a sense of
fairness, but others think it is punishment or even something else. Best to qualify this statement
slightly (i.e., it is the most commonly used game to study inequity).
P2, line 58 – do you mean other non-primate species?
P 3, line 6 – do you mean the frustration hypothesis? If not, you need to clarify how responding
preferentially to a solo condition is based on expectations from what the partner received.
P 3, line 17 – this is an interesting study, but could use a bit more explanation. How was the
inequity instantiated? Also, this is much closer to the reciprocity-style paradigms seen routinely
in primates, in which one subject passes a needed object to another (Yamamoto, Humle, &
Tanaka, 2012) or provides help (de Waal & Berger, 2000; Takimoto & Fujita, 2011).
Methods: I understand that sample sizes can be quite small with animals, but why were no
females tested? And why were only 4 of the 13 keas in the group tested. I think the results are
meaningful even with a small sample size, but this needs to be contextualized. Also, thank you
for providing the ages, but can you provide context for where they were in their life history (i.e.,
juvenile, young adult, etc)?
Materials: This would be much easier to follow if you started with a summary of the goals of the
apparatus, and then explained how it was built. For instance, “Subjects were trained and tested
in a wooden apparatus that allowed them to sit side-by-side and interact with the experimenter,
3
such that they could not interfere with each other’s interactions with the experimenter and were
isolated from the rest of the group to minimize distractions.”
P 40, line 4: “gain access to the other kea’s side, as the…”
Food preference test: I really appreciatethat you had a clear criterion for differently valued foods
(other than experimenter instinct)!
On page 5, line 50, you state that the foods were out of reach but visible throughout testing, but
then on page 6, line 5, you state that birds only knew what rewards they were receiving after they
had exchanged. Can you clarify these statements?
Page 7, line 30, comma after inequity aversion
Page 7, line 38, I think that the sentence “The six experimental conditions were as follows” is left
over from an earlier version.
Results: Please justify using parametric statistics instead of non-parametric ones, given your
sample size. From looking at your graphs I do not think it will make any difference, but it seems
to be an odd choice given the n of 4.
P 7, lines 52-55: I’m not sure what you mean by “aversion behaviors”, or how this is different
from the immediately previous statement.
P 8, lines 10-15: Please state which conditions were compared in this t-test. It’s not immediately
obvious.
P 8, line 44: in response to…
P 9, line 5: Other species that react to inequity are macaques (Massen et al., 2012) and rats
(Oberliessen et al., 2016). Also, while it was not statistically significant, the bonobos doubled
their refusal rate in the inequity condition in the cited study.
P 9, line 14: are averse to inequity… Also, neither owl monkeys nor marmosets respond to
inequity (Freeman et al., 2013; Talbot, Freeman, Williams, & Brosnan, 2011), nor do cleaner fish
(Raihani, McAuliffe, Brosnan, & Bshary, 2012).
P 9, line 19: this is true in some primate species and in some contexts/studies, so best to include
the modifier.

Summary
This paper reports results from an inequity aversion experiment with kea: four keas participated
in an exchange task in which a target individual either received the same payoff as their partner
(EC) or a less desirable payoff (IC; NRIC) and these main conditions were compared to several
controls. Keas were less likely to exchange when they received no reward than in conditions in
which they were rewarded. However, keas responses were independent of their partner’s payoff
suggesting that keas were not sensitive to unequal payoffs.

General comments:
This paper nicely adds to the growing literature in IA across different species. The design
includes the relevant (and important) controls that have been adapted from work with others
species. I have several general comments that I’ll detail here and a couple of specific comments,
which I’ve listed below:
This study is framed and interpreted with reference to the cooperation hypothesis (sensu
Brosnan). I find this problematic for several reasons. First, while this hypothesis has received
some support, there have also been multiple studies of cooperative species, which have yielded
mixed or null results (many of which are already cited) suggesting that the jury is still very much
out on the question of how IA and cooperation are linked in animals. I think this controversy
needs to be made clear. Second, because this study was not designed as a comparison between a
cooperative species and a closely related non-cooperative species it is not particularly well
positioned to weigh in on the hypothesis. I suppose these findings are broadly consistent with the
cooperation hypothesis inasmuch as the absence of IA in any non-cooperative species would be
consistent with it but they are not supportive of it. I think this paper would be just as interesting
and indeed more compelling without this framing/interpretation.
I had a few general questions about the methods and discussion. First, as the authors note in the
discussion, their sample is small. I appreciate that these tasks are difficult to run with animals.
However, more light should be shed on this in the methods and discussion. It is stated that these
four individuals come from a larger group but it is not clear why these four (and no more) were
tested. Additionally, because of the small N the authors could consider showing data by
individual to echo the tables in the supplement. Second, it was unclear to me how the dyads were
created and how their turns in the focal/partner roles played out across the course of the
experiment. Because of the small N it would be straightforward for the authors to create a
supplementary table to illustrate this (like Table S1 in Range et al 2009 with additional
information about dyads). It seems as though the roles of focal and partner switched across
conditions, which is a bit unusual and should be justified. One could argue that this could
decrease chances of finding IA if subjects regularly switch between the advantageous (partner)
and disadvantageous (focal) positions. Third, I found it a bit surprising that subjects did not
know what they would be getting until they traded a token. Wouldn’t this invalidate first trials?
Finally, two notes about coding/analyses. How were refusal behaviors coded? Were they live
coded and then checked from video? Double coded live? Either way, reliably of DVs should be
reported. Finally, did the data meet the assumptions of parametric tests? While anovas have been
used for this type of data in the past, it is becoming the norm to use generalized models that can
accommodate poisson and binary data families, which seems relevant here.
Specific comments:
Introduction
- The definition of IA provided here is quite different from Fehr and Schmidt’s, which is
cited
- As has been discussed elsewhere (e.g. Henrich, 2004, Nature), the token exchange
paradigm is importantly different from work on fairness in adults. A better adult paradigm to
cite as set up for this study would be the Dawes random allocation game (Dawes 2007) in which
there is no intentional unfairness or, better yet, the impunity game (e.g., Yamagishi et al 2009) in
which there is no contingency between actor decision and recipient payoff like in the token
exchange paradigm.
Discussion:
- Your discussion is weighted towards positive evidence for IA and your findings are
indeed inconsistent with those studies. However, your results are consistent with many other
studies that show weak or absent effects of IA on animals’ responses.
6
- The culture claim relates primarily to advantageous inequity, which has not been
mentioned in this paper (but probably should be when IA is first introduced).

Summary
This paper reports results from an inequity aversion experiment with kea: four keas participated
in an exchange task in which a target individual either received the same payoff as their partner
(EC) or a less desirable payoff (IC; NRIC) and these main conditions were compared to several
controls. Keas were less likely to exchange when they received no reward than in conditions in
which they were rewarded. However, keas responses were independent of their partner’s payoff
suggesting that keas were not sensitive to unequal payoffs.
General comments:
This paper nicely adds to the growing literature in IA across different species. The design
includes the relevant (and important) controls that have been adapted from work with others
species. I have several general comments that I’ll detail here and a couple of specific comments,
which I’ve listed below:
This study is framed and interpreted with reference to the cooperation hypothesis (sensu
Brosnan). I find this problematic for several reasons. First, while this hypothesis has received
some support, there have also been multiple studies of cooperative species, which have yielded
mixed or null results (many of which are already cited) suggesting that the jury is still very much
out on the question of how IA and cooperation are linked in animals. I think this controversy
needs to be made clear. Second, because this study was not designed as a comparison between a
cooperative species and a closely related non-cooperative species it is not particularly well
positioned to weigh in on the hypothesis. I suppose these findings are broadly consistent with the
cooperation hypothesis inasmuch as the absence of IA in any non-cooperative species would be
consistent with it but they are not supportive of it. I think this paper would be just as interesting
and indeed more compelling without this framing/interpretation.
I had a few general questions about the methods and discussion. First, as the authors note in the
discussion, their sample is small. I appreciate that these tasks are difficult to run with animals.
However, more light should be shed on this in the methods and discussion. It is stated that these
four individuals come from a larger group but it is not clear why these four (and no more) were
tested. Additionally, because of the small N the authors could consider showing data by
individual to echo the tables in the supplement. Second, it was unclear to me how the dyads were
created and how their turns in the focal/partner roles played out across the course of the
experiment. Because of the small N it would be straightforward for the authors to create a
supplementary table to illustrate this (like Table S1 in Range et al 2009 with additional
information about dyads). It seems as though the roles of focal and partner switched across
conditions, which is a bit unusual and should be justified. One could argue that this could
decrease chances of finding IA if subjects regularly switch between the advantageous (partner)
and disadvantageous (focal) positions. Third, I found it a bit surprising that subjects did not
11
know what they would be getting until they traded a token. Wouldn’t this invalidate first trials?
Finally, two notes about coding/analyses. How were refusal behaviors coded? Were they live
coded and then checked from video? Double coded live? Either way, reliably of DVs should be
reported. Finally, did the data meet the assumptions of parametric tests? While anovas have been
used for this type of data in the past, it is becoming the norm to use generalized models that can
accommodate poisson and binary data families, which seems relevant here.
Specific comments:
Introduction
- The definition of IA provided here is quite different from Fehr and Schmidt’s, which is
cited
- As has been discussed elsewhere (e.g. Henrich, 2004, Nature), the token exchange
paradigm is importantly different from work on fairness in adults. A better adult paradigm to
cite as set up for this study would be the Dawes random allocation game (Dawes 2007) in which
there is no intentional unfairness or, better yet, the impunity game (e.g., Yamagishi et al 2009) in
which there is no contingency between actor decision and recipient payoff like in the token
exchange paradigm.
Discussion:
- Your discussion is weighted towards positive evidence for IA and your findings are
indeed inconsistent with those studies. However, your results are consistent with many other
studies that show weak or absent effects of IA on animals’ responses.
- The culture claim relates primarily to advantageous inequity, which has not been
mentioned in this paper (but probably should be when IA is first introduced).

Dear Editor
We have now addressed the reviewer’s comments on our paper previously titled ‘Kea show
no reaction to inequity’.
Reviewer: 1
Title: Right now the title doesn’t get across the importance of this work to testing hypotheses
about the relationship between cooperation and responses to inequity. Perhaps something
like “Keas’ lack of response to inequity supports the hypothesized link to cooperation”? It
doesn’t need to be this title, but something that better incorporates the main point of the
manuscript.
We like the reviewer’s suggestion and have amended the title accordingly (Line 1).
Abstract: Somewhere in the abstract you need to provide information about the keas’ socio-
ecology (probably around lines 30/31). Otherwise the reader doesn’t know why this is an
appropriate species for testing this hypothesis.
We now mention the keas’ social ecology (Line 16).
Introduction: In general the introduction does a nice job of introducing the question, but it
doesn’t always flow smoothly. For example, in the second full paragraph of page 2, the focus
is initially only on the species that don’t respond to inequity. But there is evidence that
several species of macaques do so (Hopper, Lambeth, Schapiro, Bernacky, & Brosnan, 2013;
Massen, Van Den Berg, Spruijt, & Sterck, 2012). There are also several other studies
showing that callithrichids do not respond to inequity (Freeman et al., 2013; Neiworth,
Johnson, Whillock, Greenberg, & Brown, 2009), and likewise the cooperatively breeding owl
monkey does not respond (Freeman and colleagues). I don’t think you need to discuss the
details of each study, but it is important to set the stage for your discussion by better setting
up the variability that is seen across species.
We now mention the papers the reviewer suggests (Lines 59-61).
P1, line 52: See also (Brosnan & de Waal, 2014).
We now cite this paper (Line 30).
P2, line 6 – One hypothesis is that humans reject unequal offers in the UG because of a sense
of fairness, but others think it is punishment or even something else. Best to qualify this
statement slightly (i.e., it is the most commonly used game to study inequity).
We have now discuss the token exchange paradigm but do qualify this statement as
suggested by the reviewer (Line 31).
P2, line 58 – do you mean other non-primate species?
We do and have now amended this accordingly (Line 74).
P 3, line 6 – do you mean the frustration hypothesis? If not, you need to clarify how
responding preferentially to a solo condition is based on expectations from what the partner
received.
We do and have now amended this accordingly (Line 77).
P 3, line 17 – this is an interesting study, but could use a bit more explanation. How was the
inequity instantiated? Also, this is much closer to the reciprocity-style paradigms seen
routinely in primates, in which one subject passes a needed object to another (Yamamoto,
Humle, & Tanaka, 2012) or provides help (de Waal & Berger, 2000; Takimoto & Fujita,
2011).
We have now added more detail to this study (Line 83-85).
Methods: I understand that sample sizes can be quite small with animals, but why were no
females tested? And why were only 4 of the 13 keas in the group tested. I think the results
are meaningful even with a small sample size, but this needs to be contextualized. Also,
thank you for providing the ages, but can you provide context for where they were in their
life history (i.e., juvenile, young adult, etc)?
As we were testing within a group enclosure we could only test those keas that
monopolized the testing stations, hence we could only test 4 kea. We were not able to
test females for the same reason. We have now added this to the paper along with the
keas life stage (Lines 19-24).
Materials: This would be much easier to follow if you started with a summary of the goals
of the apparatus, and then explained how it was built. For instance, “Subjects were trained
and tested in a wooden apparatus that allowed them to sit side-by-side and interact with the
experimenter, such that they could not interfere with each other’s interactions with the
experimenter and were isolated from the rest of the group to minimize distractions.”
P 40, line 4: “gain access to the other kea’s side, as the…”
This has been corrected
Food preference test: I really appreciate that you had a clear criterion for differently valued
foods (other than experimenter instinct)!
On page 5, line 50, you state that the foods were out of reach but visible throughout testing,
but then on page 6, line 5, you state that birds only knew what rewards they were receiving
after they had exchanged. Can you clarify these statements?
Both trays, one containing each food type, were clearly visible at all times, but it was
only after exchange of the token that the kea knew which tray the experimenter would
reach to, to take a reward and pass it to the kea. We now make this clear and cite other
studies that have done the same (Lines 178-180).
Page 7, line 30, comma after inequity aversion
This has been put in.
Page 7, line 38, I think that the sentence “The six experimental conditions were as follows”
is left over from an earlier version.
We thank the reviewer for spotting this. It has now been removed
Results: Please justify using parametric statistics instead of non-parametric ones, given your
sample size. From looking at your graphs I do not think it will make any difference, but it
seems to be an odd choice given the n of 4.
We agree and have now report non-parametric analyses of our data in our results
section.
P 7, lines 52-55: I’m not sure what you mean by “aversion behaviors”, or how this is different
from the immediately previous statement.
We have now made this clear (Lines 228-230, 248-250)
P 8, lines 10-15: Please state which conditions were compared in this t-test. It’s not
immediately obvious.
We have now clarified this (Line 257)
P 8, line 44: in response to…
This has now been changed
P 9, line 5: Other species that react to inequity are macaques (Massen et al., 2012) and rats
doubled their refusal rate in the inequity condition in the cited study.
We now cite these studies (Lines 59, 288-289)
P 9, line 14: are averse to inequity… Also, neither owl monkeys nor marmosets respond to
inequity (Freeman et al., 2013; Talbot, Freeman, Williams, & Brosnan, 2011), nor do cleaner
fish (Raihani, McAuliffe, Brosnan, & Bshary, 2012).
We now cite these studies (Lines 60-61, 292-293)
P 9, line 19: this is true in some primate species and in some contexts/studies, so best to
include the modifier.
We have now added in a modifier
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
Summary
This study is framed and interpreted with reference to the cooperation hypothesis (sensu
Brosnan). I find this problematic for several reasons. First, while this hypothesis has received
some support, there have also been multiple studies of cooperative species, which have
yielded mixed or null results (many of which are already cited) suggesting that the jury is still
very much out on the question of how IA and cooperation are linked in animals. I think this
controversy needs to be made clear.
We now cite a number of studies to indicate that this is a controversial area (Line 198-
199).
Second, because this study was not designed as a comparison between a cooperative species
and a closely related non-cooperative species it is not particularly well positioned to weigh in
on the hypothesis. I suppose these findings are broadly consistent with the cooperation
hypothesis inasmuch as the absence of IA in any non-cooperative species would be consistent
with it but they are not supportive of it. I think this paper would be just as interesting and
indeed more compelling without this framing/interpretation.
We disagree with the reviewer that we should remove this framing. As both reviewers
point out, our results are in line with the cooperation hypothesis.
I had a few general questions about the methods and discussion. First, as the authors note in
the discussion, their sample is small. I appreciate that these tasks are difficult to run with
animals. However, more light should be shed on this in the methods and discussion. It is
stated that these four individuals come from a larger group but it is not clear why these four
(and no more) were tested.
We now explain why this is the case (Line 122-124).
to echo the tables in the supplement.
We report all our individual data in the supplementary material.
Second, it was unclear to me how the dyads were created and how their turns in the
focal/partner roles played out across the course of the experiment.
We now describe this in a new section in our methodology (Lines 233-240).
Because of the small N it would be straightforward for the authors to create a supplementary
table to illustrate this (like Table S1 in Range et al 2009 with additional information about
dyads).
We have now created a supplementary table as the reviewer suggests, which is in our
supplementary materials section.
It seems as though the roles of focal and partner switched across conditions, which is a bit
unusual and should be justified. One could argue that this could decrease chances of finding
IA if subjects regularly switch between the advantageous (partner) and disadvantageous
(focal) positions.
There has been variability in what other studies have done. Wascher et al [1] alternated
subject and partner each session. In Range et al [2] one dog served as subject for all
conditions and then they swapped. The order of condition for each subject was
pseudorandomised as like us, they never started with a no reward condition to avoid
frustration. Our study followed Range et al, aside from when subjects did the same
action for the same reward, where it followed [3]. This is now described in (Lines 233-
240).
Third, I found it a bit surprising that subjects did not know what they would be getting until
they traded a token. Wouldn’t this invalidate first trials?
We followed past methodologies, which we cite (Lines 178-180). The whole point when
testing for inequity aversion is that subjects’ expectation of what they should receive for
exchanging a token should be set by what they observe their partner receiving. So on
the first trial the subject does not know what they are getting, but should have an
expectation due to seeing their partner receive a particular reward.
Finally, two notes about coding/analyses. How were refusal behaviors coded? Were they live
coded and then checked from video? Double coded live? Either way, reliably of DVs should
be reported.
We explain how we coded behaviours in Table 1. Behaviours were coded by a research
assistant watching the experiment and then checked later on video by the first author.
We now report interobserver reliability (Lines 229-230).
for this type of data in the past, it is becoming the norm to use generalized models that can
accommodate poisson and binary data families, which seems relevant here.
We now report non-parametric tests in our results.
Specific comments:
Introduction
- The definition of IA provided here is quite different from Fehr and Schmidt’s, which is cited
We now use a different definition from recent work on inequity aversion in children [4]
(Lines 27-29).
- As has been discussed elsewhere (e.g. Henrich, 2004, Nature), the token exchange paradigm
is importantly different from work on fairness in adults. A better adult paradigm to cite as set
up for this study would be the Dawes random allocation game (Dawes 2007) in which there
is no intentional unfairness or, better yet, the impunity game (e.g., Yamagishi et al 2009) in
which there is no contingency between actor decision and recipient payoff like in the token
exchange paradigm.
We now introduce advantageous and disadvantageous inequity with reference to the
recent methodology used with children (Lines 31-42)
Discussion:
- Your discussion is weighted towards positive evidence for IA and your findings are indeed
inconsistent with those studies. However, your results are consistent with many other studies
that show weak or absent effects of IA on animals’ responses.to this
We agree and have now added more references to studies showing IA is absent in
different animal species (Lines 292-294).
- The culture claim relates primarily to advantageous inequity, which has not been mentioned
in this paper (but probably should be when IA is first introduced).
We have now removed reference to culture here (Line 280), but do now mention
advantageous inequity at the start when discussing work on IA in humans (Lines 38-42).
Having addressed the concerns raised by the reviewers we now hope that our manuscript will
be acceptable for publication in Royal Society: Open Science.

Dear Editor
We have now addressed the reviewer’s comments on our paper.
found this to be a somewhat responsive revision. I think the MS has certainly been improved by
he more thorough coverage of IA results across different species, by the additional
methodological details and by the new approach to analyses. However, I was disappointed to see
hat the authors not only glossed over my comment about the framing (i.e., that these results
somehow support the link between IA and cooperation) but, instead, increased the focus on this
nterpretation of their findings. In my view, the commitment to this claim is quite bizarre. As I
said before, by this logic, the absence of IA in just about anything would be similarly
supportive’ of the cooperation hypothesis. The authors claim that “both reviewers agree that
heir results are in line with the cooperation hypothesis” but my previous comments were, in
act, in direct opposition to this idea. I think any reader familiar with this area (and comparative
work more generally) is going to find this framing to be rather peculiar and certainly not well
supported by the data at hand. To be clear: I am not suggesting that the authors abandon this
dea altogether, but rather maintain that they should seriously consider toning down this
nterpretation and should, instead, offer it as one possible reading of their results.
As we pointed out to the editor after the last set of reviewers, our two reviewers made
statements that were almost directly opposite in the requirements: one wanted us to
ncrease the reference to framing, and one to decrease it. We asked the editor to make a
decision about which direction we should take the paper. The editor replied with this: "In
his case, where there is a bit of a conflict or preference difference between two reviewers, it
seems best for the authors to decide how best to present their paper to reflect what they want to
get across. They can take cues from reviewers on where this might be made clearer. But I
would generally trust the authors to pick up on comments to see how to revise."
We felt we had made a taken a balanced stance between the two reviewers, but it seemed
obvious with two reviewers asking for opposite things that we could not please both. Given
his last review we have now reduced the framing of our results by changing the title to
something more neutral, removed the final line of our abstract and changed ‘support’ to
in line with’ (Line 280). We would appreciate more guidance from the editor if our
revisions are not sufficient for our paper to now be accepted.
