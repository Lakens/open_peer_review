This study tests the ability of adopted Korean individuals to improve their production of Korean
phonemes (i.e., relearn) through training and compares the outcome with control participants.
The results show a compelling pattern of facilitation for the test group and some evidence that
this pattern is linked to perceptual improvement.
General assessment
This paper, which is generally clearly written, reports an interesting and novel set of results
within a literature that has recently become a bit crowded. The novelty of this study is the
production side of the “re-learning” construct and the implications that the findings have for our
understanding of the format of the representations underlying speech perception and production.
The study was meticulously conducted and based on impressively large participant samples
(learners and raters). The results are compelling and add a new, theoretically constraining data
point to the literature on language relearning. The results should definitely be published, and
Royal Society Open Science seems like an excellent fit. On the other hand, non-trivial work is
needed to make this manuscript easier to read, follow, and interpret. Issues and
recommendations are summarised below:
(1) Introduction and theoretical motivation
It took me a while to realise that this paper was only about the production side of a larger study
whose perceptual data have already been published elsewhere. I don’t see a problem with that,
but the authors should make this clear from the outset, perhaps even in the Abstract. The
Introduction, as it stands, feels like it was written to introduce a perceptual study. The portions of
the Introduction discussing the production side of relearning feel “tacked on” and even
secondary. Production should be driving the Introduction and the perceptual background
seriously streamlined. The Introduction should end with a set of clear hypotheses and their
theoretical motivation. I appreciate this will require a substantial overhaul, but it will eventually
pay off and make the paper a lot stronger.
(2) Method
- Following up on the above, the Method section will need to reflect the emphasis on the
production side of the design.
- The authors put a great deal of thinking into selecting their Korean participants and their
matched controls. However, we should also be provided with the average age at testing (or time
since adoption) for each of the two sub-groups – currently, we only have a figure for the entire
group. Hopefully, the two groups will be similar on that dimension.
- No justification is given for using a single talker in the early sessions and multiple talkers in the
later sessions.
- The design seems to distinguish between testing and training sessions, but very little is said
about the testing sessions, except that they were carried out at three time points.
(3) Results
- Production and rating analyses: These are strong, by and large. The lack of interaction in the
rating data is a shame, but the contrast analyses indirectly confirm the difference in learning
between the two groups. Regarding the identification data, I wonder if there is anything to learn
from the incorrect responses, specifically whether the extent to which their convergence into one
of the two incorrect categories is affected by time and/or group. Just a thought.
- Control analyses (section 3.1.4): I’m unclear what these analyses are attempting to test or control
for. Why were correlations measured on sample 1 and sample 2 individually rather than on the
difference between the two (a measure of improvement)? Whether this is needed or not will
depend on the actual purpose of the analyses, but this section is pretty obscure at the moment.
3
- Relation between perception and production (section 3.2): The current correlations are
impressive, but the more fundamental test seems to be missing, namely, correlations between
perceptual improvement and production improvement. Positive correlations in the Korean group
would provide the strongest demonstration that changes in the representations used for
perception are accompanied with changes in representations for production, and hence, possibly
demonstrate commonality between the two. I understand that these might not reach significance
(then so be it), but reporting them seems rather crucial.
(4) General Discussion
In general, I found this section overly discursive compared to the actual take-home message.
Specifically, the first page and a half could be drastically reduced. The real discussion begins with
“The general questions…” (p. 23), but the rest of that paragraph does not seem to really address
those questions. Things slowly start moving with the discussion of how the data accommodate or
constrain abstractionist vs exemplar models of speech representations (p. 24). [As an aside, this
should be the kind of framework discussed in the revised Introduction]. The discussion picks up
nicely from there.
However, parts of the discussion are based on the implicit assumption that the present data
showed hand-in-hand improvement between perception and production. But again, this analysis
was NOT presented in the Results section. Something will need to be adjusted here, one way or
another.
Specific
- Age of adoption contrast: The pre/post 6-month contrast is a strength of the study, but it would
be worth making it clear that these two sub-groups are contrasted on many correlated
dimensions: onset of production, perceptual tuning to native sounds, vocabulary acquisition,
possibly orthography for some.
- p.4: “another study” > “other studies” (since two studies are referenced)
- p.8: the past tense should be used consistently.
- p.21: “Both groups… did their best…”. This sentences does not add much, and we have no way
of showing that it is true. I would omit it.
- It might be more informative to call Sample 1 and Sample 2, Time 1 and Time 2, or Pre and Post.
- Figures: I suggest using the more conventional *** <.001, **<.01, *<.05 notation.
- Figures 1 and 2: Parts a and b are redundant. The scatterplot function in R will allow you to
superimpose averages, individual data points, and error bars.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The present paper is an original and important contribution to the literature. The systematic
nature of the training paradigm coupled with the relatively large sample sizes is compelling, and
allows for a link to be made not only between early established representations for language
sounds and their role in re-learning later in life, but also highlights how such representations can
contribute to production. Implications generalize beyond internationally-adopted participants to
mechanisms underlying language learning and use more generally. I have generally minor
comments and questions, as presented below:
Title
The use of the word "residue" in the title seems a bit off to me. Could it be changed to something
more precise? (See later comment about coming up with a consistent and precise way to
label/discuss what it is that persists in the brain following early experience with language)
Abstract
page 2, line 8: it might be more appropriate to say "appears to facilitate (re)learning..." since your
unpublished study and the present paper provide a lot of the evidence that early experience does
in fact facilitate relearning (i.e., it’s not necessarily clear from the currently published literature
that it definitely facilitates relearning).
page 2, line 13: insert "their" (with Korean as "their" birth language and Dutch as "their" current
language)
page 2, line 18: insert "the" (at "the" outset and end of the training)
page 2, line 30: I think something like "surpassed" would work better here than "outstripped"
Introduction
page 3, line 7: I'm not sure that I agree with the word "passively" in this sentence. Since the
authors are talking about processes that start prior to birth I take their point, however I wonder if
something like "automatically" might work better since children's interactions with their
environments play such an important role in how language is learned and the term passive
dismisses that somewhat.
page 3, line 21: "native language" or "language most present in the environment" might work
better than "environmental language" (this occurs in a few places throughout the paper)
page 3, line 31: could "go to waste" be replaced with something else? Since early language
experience is critical, even if the language environment changes (i.e., kids are much worse off if
they get no early language input at all), I don't think any early language experience is "wasteful."
Rather, I think what the authors mean is that the work the brain has done to set up language-
specific processing for one language is now confronted with the challenge of re-learning a new
language in a different language environment.
page 4, line 3: Glennen & Masters (2002) could be added as a reference to the sentence "adoptees
who as young children could speak in their birth language start within months to forget..." They
have quite a large sample size, which corroborates the case studies currently cited.
5
page 4, line 36: Might be helpful to start the paragraph by introducing why it is important to look
at this question in adoptees as well. Also, references 21 and 22 do find some difference between
adoptees and non-adoptees. Could this be discussed in more detail?
page 4, line 43/46: "This could suggest that such benefits may be short-lived, and particularly
experienced in the facility with which initial (re)learning occurs." I'm having a bit of trouble
parsing this sentence. Do you mean that training benefits are most likely to manifest in the
context in which they were learned, and do not generalize outside of that context? Please clarify.
page 5, line 40: again, I'm not sure about using "residue of knowledge." There are several
instances throughout the paper that talk about what remains in the brain in different ways (e.g.,
knowledge, information, residue, residue of knowledge) and all these terms are quite vague. I
know this is difficult since it is not known exactly what it is that persists in the brain (though the
authors attempt to tackle this in the discussion in a helpful and informative way), however it
would strengthen the paper to have a more precise and consistent way of talking about what it
means for the effects of an early experience to persist.
page 6, line 3: replace "teenagers" with "children and adolescents"
page 6, line 13: "...their brain retained the ability to respond to its sounds." Technically all groups’
brains responded to the sounds, however the adoptees' brains responded to the sounds in a way
that indicated they had linguistic relevance, as opposed to being processed as a complex, but non-
linguistic, acoustic stream of sounds. This is a small detail but I think it's critical to clarify because
it reflects how learning can change the way the brain responds to input, which supports your
point.
page 6, line 40: change "but not their" to "non-native"; there are also more current references that
might be useful to include - Werker & Hensch (2015) provides a great review
page 7, line 16: can the authors clarify what they mean here by "remain useful" and provide
references? (i.e., useful for re-learning the L1? In the case of L2 learning you could argue that in
some ways persistent representations might be useful, in that they have some basis for language
they can work with, but in other ways they might interfere, because they have to learn a new set
of language sounds on top of a previously existing one, though this is not necessary to get into if
the authors are just referring to L1 re-learning)
page 7, line 22: "...that has now convincingly established a relearning advantage." Is it the case
that a relearning advantage has been convincingly established? I think it would be helpful to see
the authors' "under review" work to support this point more strongly. But without that, due to
factors such as small and heterogeneous sample sizes and training conditions (e.g., university
courses) that have been reported in other papers, and effects that are limited to certain aspects of
language but not others, I think we can only say at this point that there is some evidence for a re-
learning advantage. Although in fact I think this change in wording strengthens your study as
you can put greater emphasis on what your training paradigm has brought to the previous
research on this topic - you are part of "convincingly establishing" a re-learning advantage.
page 7, line 50/53: "If abstract phonological representations..." This is a valuable and interesting
idea to test! Might be helpful to highlight this argument explicitly throughout as it makes the
jump from an interesting pattern observed in adoptees to a more general underlying principle of
how the brain acquires language sounds and how those are used over time in different ways.
page 8, line 13: why was there such a big gap in ages for the adoptees? That is, half of the
adoptees were adopted before 6 months, and half after 17 months. Why was there no one
adopted between 6 and 17 months? Were the groups selected on purpose in this way? Is there
6
some other explanation? This would be helpful to explicate - and could be done in the method
section as opposed to here where the groups are first introduced.
page 8, line 15: Do you have any information about their language abilities at adoption? If so this
would be helpful to include either in the paper or in supplementary materials
Methods
page 9, line 28: Is the convention 5;10 with a semi-colon, as opposed to 5:10 with a colon?
page 9, line 33: How was it determined that no adoptees had attempted to learn Korean after
adoption?
page 9, line 40: Trips to Korea are reported, but is there any information on whether they were
exposed to Korean in their adoption country (e.g., through community, language courses,
friends)? Again, as above, if the information is available it would be helpful to have a more
thorough/quantitative description of participants' language environments either here or in
supplementary materials.
page 10, line 8: Have you looked to see whether there is a difference in performance for the
adoptees who had visited Korea and those who had not (could do this same comparison for
Dutch-speakers as well, since they also had trips to Korea)? Was there any advantage for the
group who already had some re-exposure? (This might provide an interesting contrast between
passive exposure and active training)
page 10, line 49: could demographic information for native-speaker controls be included
somewhere, perhaps in Table S1?
page 12, paragraph starting line 9: Is there any way to verify that the groups completed the
training to an equal extent? That is, is there any possibility that one of the groups was more
motivated and so completed all the training sessions, while the other group did not? Can you
know whether they actually completed each session (and/or how many they did complete)?
page 13, line 11: reference 28 did not have any perceptual training
page 13, line 32: It would be helpful to be able to see this data. Is there a way to include a
summary figure or table in supplementary info? Or is it likely that the "under review" manuscript
will be reported prior to this paper?
page 14, line 46: Why was the last token of the second repetition chosen? Why was it that the last
or first token of the third repetitions were chosen instead (as opposed to some other token) in
cases where the last token of the second repetition could not be used?
page 16, line 3: Is there any background information on the raters aside from age and gender? Is
there any difference in, for example, academic background that might influence how they rated
the samples? And, if so, were rater characteristics distributed evenly across the groups that were
rated?
Results
page 16, line 32: why were the mean proportions arcsine transformed?
page 16, line 42: When describing "sample" it might be helpful to say something like pre/post
training instead of just sample 1 and 2 to make it very clear where the samples were taken from
and what you are comparing
page 18, line 54: Why do you think older current age was related to worse utterance ratings?
7
page 20, line 34: Is there any added benefit of doing a regression analysis instead of a correlation
analysis? That is, could you use regression to see whether perceptual results (or degree of
improvement across perceptual training) predict production results (controlling for your other
variables), and then see if this is moderated by adoption status (i.e., is there a relationship
between perception and production for the adoptee group only)? The way you currently have it
set up could it not be the case that participants who were better “producers” were better at
learning, leading to the same pattern of results? Also, are there any issues with restricted range in
the Dutch group, or more variability in the adoptee group, that could be leading to significant
correlations observed in one group but not the other?
General Discussion
page 21, line 29: I think it’s more accurate to say that native listeners identified the target sounds
produced by the adoptee group more accurately (rather than more easily identified) than the
sounds produced by the controls
page 21, line 34: “Both groups of participants did their best in all the tasks…” Do you have
evidence for this?
page 22, line 23/25: If there is, in general, a relationship between perception and production (as
you have cited earlier), why do you think it is the case that no relationship was seen in the Dutch
group after training? Would you predict that the Dutch group might need more extensive
training, and at that point a relationship would be observed? Or would a relationship never be
observed because the Dutch group has no early experience with Korean sounds, and it is those
early established perceptual representations that are crucial for this relationship?
page 23, line 34-39: “…although at six months the phonemic repertoire of the environmental
language does not yet support language-specific phoneme discrimination.” Can the authors
clarify what they mean by this point?
page 23 last paragraph/page 24 first paragraph: Could this paragraph be made clearer? There are
references that support how infants establish a distribution of phonetic contrasts (e.g., from
Patricia Kuhl, and from Maye, Werker and Gerken (2002) and Yoshida, Pons, Maye, & Werker
(2010) that might be useful here.
page 24, paragraph beginning line 19: Can the authors provide citations for these different
accounts? It would also provide clarity if the paragraph began by explaining that, although the
study provides evidence that native language representations are retained, the nature of what is
retained is unclear, and then go on to provide accounts of these models that might explain the
mechanisms underlying such retention.
page 26, line 33/35: “…not veridical memory traces of accrued exposures, but rather an
abstraction from those early exposures.” Could it be a combination? In order to apply an abstract
rule, do you not also need to know when to apply the rule (e.g., to know that x contrast can be
split into 3 but y contrast can only split into 2 the listener needs to have some representation of
the sounds that lead to those rules). It may be that I am misunderstanding this paragraph,
though.
page 27, final line: I think you could add a sentence or two at the end to relate what you have
found to the general idea that very early experiences have a lasting impact on different aspects of
language over time, as a way of moving beyond the findings with adoptees to their more general
implications for language development.
Figures & Tables
For the plots on identification accuracy and ratings across time points could the authors add a
plot to show each participant’s improvement over samples? E.g., have a plot for KA with time 1
and time 2, show all individual data points (as you have in panel b of your figures), and have
lines connecting time 1 to time 2 for each participant as an indicator of the number of participants
8
who showed improvement and by how much (and then repeat that figure for DC)? I think a plot
like that would illustrate the degree to which the KA group showed greater improvement than
the DC group as a result of training, though I am not sure of the journal’s restrictions on number
of figures.
Table S2
How do the authors explain the finding that pre-training samples are correlated with
identification accuracy and ratings if the argument is that training facilitates adoptees’ use of
perception in production? Can you rule out the fact that some people might be better producers
from the start, and those are the ones who do better in the training? Or do you think there could
be some effect of having been exposed to Korean in the adoptee group that makes them
somewhat better at producing Korean sounds even before training (but that this is improved with
training)?

contribute to production. Implications generalize beyond internationally-adopted participants to
mechanisms underlying language learning and use more generally. I have generally minor
comments and questions, as presented below:
Title
The use of the word "residue" in the title seems a bit off to me. Could it be changed to something
more precise? (See later comment about coming up with a consistent and precise way to
label/discuss what it is that persists in the brain following early experience with language)

Abstract
page 2, line 8: it might be more appropriate to say "appears to facilitate (re)learning..." since your
unpublished study and the present paper provide a lot of the evidence that early experience does
in fact facilitate relearning (i.e., it’s not necessarily clear from the currently published literature
that it definitely facilitates relearning).
page 2, line 13: insert "their" (with Korean as "their" birth language and Dutch as "their" current
language)
page 2, line 18: insert "the" (at "the" outset and end of the training)
page 2, line 30: I think something like "surpassed" would work better here than "outstripped"
Introduction
page 3, line 7: I'm not sure that I agree with the word "passively" in this sentence. Since the
authors are talking about processes that start prior to birth I take their point, however I wonder if
something like "automatically" might work better since children's interactions with their
environments play such an important role in how language is learned and the term passive
dismisses that somewhat.
page 3, line 21: "native language" or "language most present in the environment" might work
better than "environmental language" (this occurs in a few places throughout the paper)
page 3, line 31: could "go to waste" be replaced with something else? Since early language
experience is critical, even if the language environment changes (i.e., kids are much worse off if
they get no early language input at all), I don't think any early language experience is "wasteful."
Rather, I think what the authors mean is that the work the brain has done to set up language-
specific processing for one language is now confronted with the challenge of re-learning a new
language in a different language environment.
page 4, line 3: Glennen & Masters (2002) could be added as a reference to the sentence "adoptees
who as young children could speak in their birth language start within months to forget..." They
have quite a large sample size, which corroborates the case studies currently cited.
page 4, line 36: Might be helpful to start the paragraph by introducing why it is important to look
at this question in adoptees as well. Also, references 21 and 22 do find some difference between
adoptees and non-adoptees. Could this be discussed in more detail?
page 4, line 43/46: "This could suggest that such benefits may be short-lived, and particularly
experienced in the facility with which initial (re)learning occurs." I'm having a bit of trouble
parsing this sentence. Do you mean that training benefits are most likely to manifest in the
context in which they were learned, and do not generalize outside of that context? Please clarify.
page 5, line 40: again, I'm not sure about using "residue of knowledge." There are several
instances throughout the paper that talk about what remains in the brain in different ways (e.g.,
knowledge, information, residue, residue of knowledge) and all these terms are quite vague. I
know this is difficult since it is not known exactly what it is that persists in the brain (though the
authors attempt to tackle this in the discussion in a helpful and informative way), however it
would strengthen the paper to have a more precise and consistent way of talking about what it
means for the effects of an early experience to persist.
page 6, line 3: replace "teenagers" with "children and adolescents"
page 6, line 13: "...their brain retained the ability to respond to its sounds." Technically all groups’
brains responded to the sounds, however the adoptees' brains responded to the sounds in a way
that indicated they had linguistic relevance, as opposed to being processed as a complex, but non-
13
linguistic, acoustic stream of sounds. This is a small detail but I think it's critical to clarify because
it reflects how learning can change the way the brain responds to input, which supports your
point.
page 6, line 40: change "but not their" to "non-native"; there are also more current references that
might be useful to include - Werker & Hensch (2015) provides a great review
page 7, line 16: can the authors clarify what they mean here by "remain useful" and provide
references? (i.e., useful for re-learning the L1? In the case of L2 learning you could argue that in
some ways persistent representations might be useful, in that they have some basis for language
they can work with, but in other ways they might interfere, because they have to learn a new set
of language sounds on top of a previously existing one, though this is not necessary to get into if
the authors are just referring to L1 re-learning)
page 7, line 22: "...that has now convincingly established a relearning advantage." Is it the case
that a relearning advantage has been convincingly established? I think it would be helpful to see
the authors' "under review" work to support this point more strongly. But without that, due to
factors such as small and heterogeneous sample sizes and training conditions (e.g., university
courses) that have been reported in other papers, and effects that are limited to certain aspects of
language but not others, I think we can only say at this point that there is some evidence for a re-
learning advantage. Although in fact I think this change in wording strengthens your study as
you can put greater emphasis on what your training paradigm has brought to the previous
research on this topic - you are part of "convincingly establishing" a re-learning advantage.
page 7, line 50/53: "If abstract phonological representations..." This is a valuable and interesting
idea to test! Might be helpful to highlight this argument explicitly throughout as it makes the
jump from an interesting pattern observed in adoptees to a more general underlying principle of
how the brain acquires language sounds and how those are used over time in different ways.
page 8, line 13: why was there such a big gap in ages for the adoptees? That is, half of the
adoptees were adopted before 6 months, and half after 17 months. Why was there no one
adopted between 6 and 17 months? Were the groups selected on purpose in this way? Is there
some other explanation? This would be helpful to explicate - and could be done in the method
section as opposed to here where the groups are first introduced.
page 8, line 15: Do you have any information about their language abilities at adoption? If so this
would be helpful to include either in the paper or in supplementary materials
Methods
page 9, line 28: Is the convention 5;10 with a semi-colon, as opposed to 5:10 with a colon?
page 9, line 33: How was it determined that no adoptees had attempted to learn Korean after
adoption?
page 9, line 40: Trips to Korea are reported, but is there any information on whether they were
exposed to Korean in their adoption country (e.g., through community, language courses,
friends)? Again, as above, if the information is available it would be helpful to have a more
thorough/quantitative description of participants' language environments either here or in
supplementary materials.
page 10, line 8: Have you looked to see whether there is a difference in performance for the
adoptees who had visited Korea and those who had not (could do this same comparison for
Dutch-speakers as well, since they also had trips to Korea)? Was there any advantage for the
group who already had some re-exposure? (This might provide an interesting contrast between
passive exposure and active training)
14
page 10, line 49: could demographic information for native-speaker controls be included
somewhere, perhaps in Table S1?
page 12, paragraph starting line 9: Is there any way to verify that the groups completed the
training to an equal extent? That is, is there any possibility that one of the groups was more
motivated and so completed all the training sessions, while the other group did not? Can you
know whether they actually completed each session (and/or how many they did complete)?
page 13, line 11: reference 28 did not have any perceptual training
page 13, line 32: It would be helpful to be able to see this data. Is there a way to include a
summary figure or table in supplementary info? Or is it likely that the "under review" manuscript
will be reported prior to this paper?
page 14, line 46: Why was the last token of the second repetition chosen? Why was it that the last
or first token of the third repetitions were chosen instead (as opposed to some other token) in
cases where the last token of the second repetition could not be used?
page 16, line 3: Is there any background information on the raters aside from age and gender? Is
there any difference in, for example, academic background that might influence how they rated
the samples? And, if so, were rater characteristics distributed evenly across the groups that were
rated?
Results
page 16, line 32: why were the mean proportions arcsine transformed?
page 16, line 42: When describing "sample" it might be helpful to say something like pre/post
training instead of just sample 1 and 2 to make it very clear where the samples were taken from
and what you are comparing
page 18, line 54: Why do you think older current age was related to worse utterance ratings?
page 20, line 34: Is there any added benefit of doing a regression analysis instead of a correlation
analysis? That is, could you use regression to see whether perceptual results (or degree of
improvement across perceptual training) predict production results (controlling for your other
variables), and then see if this is moderated by adoption status (i.e., is there a relationship
between perception and production for the adoptee group only)? The way you currently have it
set up could it not be the case that participants who were better “producers” were better at
learning, leading to the same pattern of results? Also, are there any issues with restricted range in
the Dutch group, or more variability in the adoptee group, that could be leading to significant
correlations observed in one group but not the other?
General Discussion
page 21, line 29: I think it’s more accurate to say that native listeners identified the target sounds
produced by the adoptee group more accurately (rather than more easily identified) than the
sounds produced by the controls
page 21, line 34: “Both groups of participants did their best in all the tasks…” Do you have
evidence for this?
page 22, line 23/25: If there is, in general, a relationship between perception and production (as
you have cited earlier), why do you think it is the case that no relationship was seen in the Dutch
group after training? Would you predict that the Dutch group might need more extensive
training, and at that point a relationship would be observed? Or would a relationship never be
observed because the Dutch group has no early experience with Korean sounds, and it is those
early established perceptual representations that are crucial for this relationship?
15
page 23, line 34-39: “…although at six months the phonemic repertoire of the environmental
language does not yet support language-specific phoneme discrimination.” Can the authors
clarify what they mean by this point?
page 23 last paragraph/page 24 first paragraph: Could this paragraph be made clearer? There are
references that support how infants establish a distribution of phonetic contrasts (e.g., from
Patricia Kuhl, and from Maye, Werker and Gerken (2002) and Yoshida, Pons, Maye, & Werker
(2010) that might be useful here.
page 24, paragraph beginning line 19: Can the authors provide citations for these different
accounts? It would also provide clarity if the paragraph began by explaining that, although the
study provides evidence that native language representations are retained, the nature of what is
retained is unclear, and then go on to provide accounts of these models that might explain the
mechanisms underlying such retention.
page 26, line 33/35: “…not veridical memory traces of accrued exposures, but rather an
abstraction from those early exposures.” Could it be a combination? In order to apply an abstract
rule, do you not also need to know when to apply the rule (e.g., to know that x contrast can be
split into 3 but y contrast can only split into 2 the listener needs to have some representation of
the sounds that lead to those rules). It may be that I am misunderstanding this paragraph,
though.
page 27, final line: I think you could add a sentence or two at the end to relate what you have
found to the general idea that very early experiences have a lasting impact on different aspects of
language over time, as a way of moving beyond the findings with adoptees to their more general
implications for language development.
Figures & Tables
For the plots on identification accuracy and ratings across time points could the authors add a
plot to show each participant’s improvement over samples? E.g., have a plot for KA with time 1
and time 2, show all individual data points (as you have in panel b of your figures), and have
lines connecting time 1 to time 2 for each participant as an indicator of the number of participants
who showed improvement and by how much (and then repeat that figure for DC)? I think a plot
like that would illustrate the degree to which the KA group showed greater improvement than
the DC group as a result of training, though I am not sure of the journal’s restrictions on number
of figures.
Table S2
How do the authors explain the finding that pre-training samples are correlated with
identification accuracy and ratings if the argument is that training facilitates adoptees’ use of
perception in production? Can you rule out the fact that some people might be better producers
from the start, and those are the ones who do better in the training? Or do you think there could
be some effect of having been exposed to Korean in the adoptee group that makes them
somewhat better at producing Korean sounds even before training (but that this is improved with
training)?

Dear Professor Viding,
Thank you once again for granting the extensions that our personal circumstances
made necessary for the completion of this revision. The new version is now attached,
and we are happy to report that we have addressed every recommendation and
comment that the two reviewers made. Moreover, we feel that the paper is
substantially better as a result, and we would like to note that the very constructive
nature of these two reviews has gone a long way towards restoring our faith in the
peer review process at psychology outlets.
A detailed response to each point is listed below. In brief, the abstract has
had its wording adjusted, the introduction has been reorganised, the methods and
results sections have been clarified and further analyses have been conducted, the
discussion has been shortened and has become more focussed, and further
references have been added – all in response to reviewer suggestions.
Also attached is a new Supplementary Information file, now substantially
extended with new analyses and with some control analyses with null results that
were previously in the main text.
We look forward to hearing from you again.
Yours sincerely,
Jiyoun Choi, Anne Cutler and Mirjam Broersma
DETAILED RESPONSES
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This study tests the ability of adopted Korean individuals to improve their production of Korean
phonemes (i.e., relearn) through training and compares the outcome with control participants.
The results show a compelling pattern of facilitation for the test group and some evidence that
this pattern is linked to perceptual improvement.
General assessment
This paper, which is generally clearly written, reports an interesting and novel set of results within
a literature that has recently become a bit crowded. The novelty of this study is the production
side of the “re-learning” construct and the implications that the findings have for our
understanding of the format of the representations underlying speech perception and production.
The study was meticulously conducted and based on impressively large participant samples
(learners and raters). The results are compelling and add a new, theoretically constraining data
point to the literature on language relearning. The results should definitely be published, and
Royal Society Open Science seems like an excellent fit. On the other hand, non-trivial work is
needed to make this manuscript easier to read, follow, and interpret. Issues and
recommendations are summarised below:
Introduction and theoretical motivation
1. It took me a while to realise that this paper was only about the production side of a larger study
whose perceptual data have already been published elsewhere. I don’t see a problem with that,
but the authors should make this clear from the outset, perhaps even in the Abstract. The
Introduction, as it stands, feels like it was written to introduce a perceptual study. The portions of
the Introduction discussing the production side of relearning feel “tacked on” and even secondary.
Production should be driving the Introduction and the perceptual background seriously
streamlined. The Introduction should end with a set of clear hypotheses and their theoretical
motivation. I appreciate this will require a substantial overhaul, but it will eventually pay off and
make the paper a lot stronger.
<U+F086> We have extensively revised the introduction in response to this suggestion. The theoretical
issues, and the importance of production evidence in testing them, are now present from the first
page of the introduction on, while the adoptee case as a way of testing them is introduced
subsequently. We have also further clarified the relationship between our own perceptual report
and the present report. We thank the reviewer for these suggestions, as we too believe that the
revised introduction is a great improvement to our paper.
Having said that, while the perception evidence has certainly been “streamlined” (R1’s word) in
that the argument flows much better and the perception evidence takes up somewhat less space,
all the studies are still there. R1, of course, knows the adoptee literature in great detail, and since
that literature has so far concerned nearly 100% perceptual work, it was perhaps unavoidable
that R1 should get the feeling of reading another perceptual paper in what he calls a “crowded”
space. In our opinion this specialised literature, by comparison with psychological topics in
general, is actually quite small, and we suspect that by far the majority of RSOS readers will be
quite unfamiliar with it. It is important to make the converging consensus on the perceptual work
clear by way of background to our current advance. The streamlining therefore did not stretch to
omitting any of the perceptual studies.
As for the abstract: it has always begun with the nature of linguistic representations, and
contained only a summary of the production method and results, with only a brief mention of the
perceptual study embedding. This is what R1 wanted as the structure of the introduction too, so
they now match. Thus the abstract structure has remained as it was, although the abstract’s
wording has changed to remove any implication of a correlation across production and
perception improvement, as well as in response to points raised by R2 (see below).
Method
2. Following up on the above, the Method section will need to reflect the emphasis on the
production side of the design.
The method section contains all details of the production side of the design. The section
previously labelled “Perception” in fact contained details of the materials. The label has been
changed to reflect this and the section has been shortened.
3. The authors put a great deal of thinking into selecting their Korean participants and their
matched controls. However, we should also be provided with the average age at testing (or time
since adoption) for each of the two sub-groups – currently, we only have a figure for the entire
group. Hopefully, the two groups will be similar on that dimension.
<U+F086> We have added this further detail on the ways in which the early- and late-adopted group
differed, briefly in the main text (p. 10) and in full detail in the SI.
4. No justification is given for using a single talker in the early sessions and multiple talkers in the
later sessions.
<U+F086> This justification is provided in the perceptual reports, but given R1’s strong recommendation
that we concentrate in this paper on the production data, we have not replicated the text from the
perception reports here. Variability of input across talkers facilitates learning of difficult L2 sounds
(Lively et al., JASA 1993) but also increases task difficulty (Mullenix et al., JASA 1989).
5. The design seems to distinguish between testing and training sessions, but very little is said
about the testing sessions, except that they were carried out at three time points.
<U+F086> As described, this section is no longer misleadingly labelled. We now distinguish between the
perceptual and production testing sessions.
Results
6. Production and rating analyses: These are strong, by and large. The lack of interaction in the
rating data is a shame, but the contrast analyses indirectly confirm the difference in learning
between the two groups. Regarding the identification data, I wonder if there is anything to learn
from the incorrect responses, specifically whether the extent to which their convergence into one
of the two incorrect categories is affected by time and/or group. Just a thought.
<U+F086> Grateful for this suggestion, we have now analysed the incorrect responses per type. It is clear
that some discriminations are intrinsically more difficult than others, so that the strongest overall
factor driving classifications of all productions, both by native controls and by the two
experimental groups, was acoustic similarity. Nonetheless, R1’s intuition proves to have been
quite correct, in that the ordering of the various discrimination error types for the Korean native
productions is closely matched by those for the adoptee group’s Time 2 productions (but never
by those for the productions of the Dutch control group). This suggests that productions of the
adoptee group came to resemble native productions by Time 2 more than productions by the
Dutch control group did. This analysis is now presented in the SI and the ordering effect is
mentioned in the text (p. 19).
A further addition is separate analysis of the productions with untrained places of articulation
(velar and bilabial), showing greater generalisation success by the adoptees.
7. Control analyses (section 3.1.4): I’m unclear what these analyses are attempting to test or
control for. Why were correlations measured on sample 1 and sample 2 individually rather than
on the difference between the two (a measure of improvement)? Whether this is needed or not
will depend on the actual purpose of the analyses, but this section is pretty obscure at the
moment.
<U+F086> These control analyses have been moved to the SI, as they indeed add little to the main report.
8. Relation between perception and production (section 3.2): The current correlations are
impressive, but the more fundamental test seems to be missing, namely, correlations between
perceptual improvement and production improvement. Positive correlations in the Korean group
would provide the strongest demonstration that changes in the representations used for
perception are accompanied with changes in representations for production, and hence, possibly
demonstrate commonality between the two. I understand that these might not reach significance
(then so be it), but reporting them seems rather crucial.
<U+F086> In designing our study, one of the most crucial decisions we faced, and the one over which we
agonised for some time, was when exactly to collect the production samples. Production is
impossible without perception; we could not possibly ask our participants to produce something
which they had never heard (or had no conscious memory of ever having heard, in the adoptee
case). But at the same time we were testing the relearning hypothesis for perception, and that
hypothesis claims that the perceptual benefit manifests itself in the early stages of perceptual
training. If we had begun participation with the collection of production data (which involved, as
described, dozens of trials), we ran the risk of corrupting the initial state for the perception test. If
we first exposed the participants to perception training, we ran the risk that it would be sufficient
to bootstrap their production abilities. We deemed the latter risk less catastrophic, and conducted
the initial production test at the end of the very first block of perception training.
With hindsight, we consider that our choice not to risk corrupting the perception data was a wise
one. The difference between adoptees and controls was not to be seen at the outset of the
perceptual training, but arose very rapidly indeed. It seems highly likely that had we started with
production tests, the necessity for perceptual modelling for the production could have led to
some advantage for the adoptees in the initial perception testing, i.e. before training, vitiating our
test of the relearning hypothesis. The participants were rare and precious and we would not have
been able to rerun our test of that hypothesis. Given that the native listener identifications and
ratings of the Time 1 productions were not significantly different for adoptees and Dutch controls,
it also appears that we did not corrupt the production data.
However, it may be that we did inadvertently make things in part somewhat harder for the current
study, in that the Time 1 productions by the adoptees could possibly have been partially
facilitated by some of this very rapid relearning even in that very first training block. If so, that is
the reason why the individual scores for the Time 1 productions would correlate with early
relearning in perception; the best relearners are already transferring their learning to production.
We now report the correlations across the respective degrees of improvement perceptually and
in production (p. 23); as R1 suspected, they are generally not significant (although they were
indeed always positive). There is nothing at all significant for the Dutch controls (all p’s > .1), but
one correlation for the adoptees reaches significance – rated production improvement Time 1 to
2 with perceptual improvement in the latter half of the perceptual training (p < .005, 2-tailed; the
same ratings result correlates with adoptee perceptual improvement across the whole perceptual
training p <.065). So there is a hint of a relationship, but we would need more power to fully test
its significance.
General Discussion
9. In general, I found this section overly discursive compared to the actual take-home message.
Specifically, the first page and a half could be drastically reduced. The real discussion begins
with “The general questions…” (p. 23), but the rest of that paragraph does not seem to really
address those questions. Things slowly start moving with the discussion of how the data
accommodate or constrain abstractionist vs exemplar models of speech representations (p. 24).
[As an aside, this should be the kind of framework discussed in the revised Introduction]. The
discussion picks up nicely from there.
<U+F086> The first page and a half of the discussion has been drastically reduced and, given that the
introduction has also been revised in the manner suggested by R1, the desired parallelism is
now in place.
10. However, parts of the discussion are based on the implicit assumption that the present data
showed hand-in-hand improvement between perception and production. But again, this analysis
was NOT presented in the Results section. Something will need to be adjusted here, one way or
another.
<U+F086> There was indeed significantly more early adoptee improvement in perception and there was
indeed significantly more adoptee improvement in production. Both of these are interpreted as
due to retained early knowledge. We never intended to imply that one was dependent upon the
other. The most likely offender as far as we can see was the more discursive account of the
present findings in the initial part of the discussion, which has now disappeared. The wording in
the remainder of the discussion has been modified to make interpretation in terms of this specific
claim even less likely.
Specific
11. Age of adoption contrast: The pre/post 6-month contrast is a strength of the study, but it
would be worth making it clear that these two sub-groups are contrasted on many correlated
dimensions: onset of production, perceptual tuning to native sounds, vocabulary acquisition,
possibly orthography for some.
<U+F086> Yet it is remarkable that none of those factors appear to have assisted the later-adopted group.
We have added some discussion of this in the General Discussion.
12. p.4: “another study” > “other studies” (since two studies are referenced)
<U+F086> We would appreciate editorial guidance here. The singular is not an error. There is one study
(Park), but it was double-published. The more complete, archival, account is in the 2015 paper.
The 2009 paper consists of a largeish amount of text taken from Park’s dissertation which is
referred to as a lab technical report (forthcoming) in the paper’s bibliography, plus another
amount of text republishing parts of a study by Abrahamsson et al. that first appeared in 2005.
We have no means of knowing why this 2009 paper (which contravenes the rules of most
journals, both rules regarding republication and rules concerning order of authorship for an initial
report of data from a dissertation) was ever published, but it is a sad fact that many authors have
referred to the 2009 paper and few have realised that its first part is the same study as the more
detailed 2015 paper. Worse, the 2009 text somehow leads some readers to assume greater
difference than was actually shown in Park’s study. For the record, the obstruent perception test
carried out by Park (most similar to the tests reported in our paper) found NO difference between
adoptees and Swedish controls studying Korean (respectively 48.5% and 51.6% correct; t(2, 32)
= 0.78, p = .44 in Hyltenstam et al. 2009, p.127; F(1, 30) = 0.6, p = .44 in Park 2015, p.785).
We now refer only to the more detailed and clearly interpreted 2015 paper. We trust that the
editor concurs with this decision.
13. p.8: the past tense should be used consistently.
<U+F086> This page now uses the past tense to accord with the method section that follows.
14. p.21: “Both groups… did their best…”. This sentences does not add much, and we have no
way of showing that it is true. I would omit it.
<U+F086> The enthusiasm of the participants was very obvious indeed to the first author, who did all the
testing! However neither reviewer approved of this remark, so it has been deleted.
15. It might be more informative to call Sample 1 and Sample 2, Time 1 and Time 2, or Pre and
Post.
<U+F086> This has been done.
16. Figures: I suggest using the more conventional *** <.001, **<.01, *<.05 notation.
<U+F086> This has been done.
17. Figures 1 and 2: Parts a and b are redundant. The scatterplot function in R will allow you to
superimpose averages, individual data points, and error bars.
<U+F086> It is true that the two parts can be combined. However, when we did that we found that the
result is a more densely packed and less easily interpreted figure. We feel strongly that the whole
reason for using a figure to illustrate results is that the main point being made about the results
should “leap out”, i.e. should be easily apprehended by readers at first glance (otherwise, a table
is preferred). Since the point of the inter-group performance difference and the point about the
variability within groups are separate and are treated separately in the text, we feel that it is
unfair to ask readers to work them out from a single figure.

Comments to the Author(s)
The present paper is an original and important contribution to the literature. The systematic
nature of the training paradigm coupled with the relatively large sample sizes is compelling, and
allows for a link to be made not only between early established representations for language
sounds and their role in re-learning later in life, but also highlights how such representations can
contribute to production. Implications generalize beyond internationally-adopted participants to
mechanisms underlying language learning and use more generally. I have generally minor
comments and questions, as presented below:
Title
1. The use of the word "residue" in the title seems a bit off to me. Could it be changed to
something more precise? (See later comment about coming up with a consistent and precise
way to label/discuss what it is that persists in the brain following early experience with language)
<U+F086> We are as frustrated as R2 with the imprecision of our current understanding of the nature of
mental representations (see our response to the later point, below). We thank the reviewer for
calling us on the connotations of the word “residue”, which was intended to contrast with the
adoptees’ own convictions that if they had ever had any Korean, they have now completely lost it.
However, we discovered that looking up “residue” in Roget produces “dirt” as one of the principal
headers, indicating that R2’s reaction to the word is spot on. We have replaced it by the neutral
term “memory”.
Abstract
2. page 2, line 8: it might be more appropriate to say "appears to facilitate (re)learning..." since
your unpublished study and the present paper provide a lot of the evidence that early experience
does in fact facilitate relearning (i.e., it’s not necessarily clear from the currently published
literature that it definitely facilitates relearning).
<U+F086> See below.
3. page 2, line 13: insert "their" (with Korean as "their" birth language and Dutch as "their" current
language)
<U+F086> See below.
4. page 2, line 18: insert "the" (at "the" outset and end of the training)
<U+F086> See below.
5. page 2, line 30: I think something like "surpassed" would work better here than "outstripped"
Introduction
<U+F086> R2’s suggestions are all improvements (“surpassed” is a much better word!), but as our
abstract was already right at the length limit, incorporating them all (which we have done) meant
that we had to lose a few other words.
6. page 3, line 7: I'm not sure that I agree with the word "passively" in this sentence. Since the
authors are talking about processes that start prior to birth I take their point, however I wonder if
something like "automatically" might work better since children's interactions with their
environments play such an important role in how language is learned and the term passive
dismisses that somewhat.
<U+F086> This has been done.
7. page 3, line 21: "native language" or "language most present in the environment" might work
better than "environmental language" (this occurs in a few places throughout the paper)
<U+F086> All occurrences have now been replaced.
8. page 3, line 31: could "go to waste" be replaced with something else? Since early language
experience is critical, even if the language environment changes (i.e., kids are much worse off if
they get no early language input at all), I don't think any early language experience is "wasteful."
Rather, I think what the authors mean is that the work the brain has done to set up language-
specific processing for one language is now confronted with the challenge of re-learning a new
language in a different language environment.
<U+F086> We agree heartily with R2 that no such learning ever goes to waste, which is indeed why we
did not write “goes to waste” but “seems to go to waste”! We have weakened it still further. Note
that this sentence has now been moved due to the revisions requested by R1.
9. page 4, line 3: Glennen & Masters (2002) could be added as a reference to the sentence
"adoptees who as young children could speak in their birth language start within months to
forget..." They have quite a large sample size, which corroborates the case studies currently
cited.
<U+F086> This useful reference has been added.
10. page 4, line 36: Might be helpful to start the paragraph by introducing why it is important to
look at this question in adoptees as well. Also, references 21 and 22 do find some difference
between adoptees and non-adoptees. Could this be discussed in more detail?
<U+F086> The paragraph transition has been adjusted as suggested. The Park study (see also our
response to R1 re this study, above) indeed found some differences in higher-level language
performance, but crucially not in the type of processing at issue here, as has now been added at
this point. If R2 should however happen to be referring to the Abrahamsson et al study also
republished in the 2009 paper, ref. [22], that study did not distinguish between those group
members who had been adopted (disrupting birth language exposure) versus those who had
moved countries together with their family (with consequent continuation of birth language
exposure), so it is not part of the adoptee literature.
11. page 4, line 43/46: "This could suggest that such benefits may be short-lived, and particularly
experienced in the facility with which initial (re)learning occurs." I'm having a bit of trouble parsing
this sentence. Do you mean that training benefits are most likely to manifest in the context in
which they were learned, and do not generalize outside of that context? Please clarify.
<U+F086> The text has been clarified.
12. page 5, line 40: again, I'm not sure about using "residue of knowledge." There are several
instances throughout the paper that talk about what remains in the brain in different ways (e.g.,
knowledge, information, residue, residue of knowledge) and all these terms are quite vague. I
know this is difficult since it is not known exactly what it is that persists in the brain (though the
authors attempt to tackle this in the discussion in a helpful and informative way), however it
would strengthen the paper to have a more precise and consistent way of talking about what it
means for the effects of an early experience to persist.
<U+F086> We agree, as no doubt does the entire RSOS psychology editorial team, that it would be
wonderful to have greater evidence-based precision in our terminology for mental
representations. As yet however, the best we can do is, as psychologists have done since our
discipline began, rely on operational definitions. The basic term we use is “knowledge”, as in the
title. “Memory”, now also in the title, refers to knowledge retained from earlier experience.
“Knowledge” is as evidence-based as behavioural science can get; if performance shows effects
of earlier experience, that experience has led to knowledge being retained in the brain in a useful
form. Note that “residue” (never an alternative term to “knowledge”, but only a qualifier of it) has
now gone, thanks to R2’s response to the word. Rather than using “knowledge” also when
referring to specific instances of stored “knowledge”, we refer to such instances, in agreement
with most psycholinguistic literature, as “representations”. We think that with respect to the
nature of the retained knowledge, our study makes a major contribution in providing evidence for
abstraction (knowledge that is not an episodic experiential record, but a generalisation across
experience). We have now further emphasised this in the General Discussion. (We would be
curious to know whether R2 has any preferable terminology in mind, but since none was offered,
perhaps this is not the case.)
13. page 6, line 3: replace "teenagers" with "children and adolescents"
<U+F086> This change suggests to us greater variation in Pierce et al’s nicely controlled study than was
actually the case. In fact the published report of the study only gives group mean ages (all
groups with a mean around 13 and a half), but after consulting the paper’s supplementary
information, we have gone for greater precision (10 to 17 years).
14. page 6, line 13: "...their brain retained the ability to respond to its sounds." Technically all
groups’ brains responded to the sounds, however the adoptees' brains responded to the sounds
in a way that indicated they had linguistic relevance, as opposed to being processed as a
complex, but non-linguistic, acoustic stream of sounds. This is a small detail but I think it's critical
to clarify because it reflects how learning can change the way the brain responds to input, which
supports your point.
<U+F086> This is a very useful observation and we have modified the text accordingly.
15. page 6, line 40: change "but not their" to "non-native"; there are also more current references
that might be useful to include - Werker & Hensch (2015) provides a great review
<U+F086> The suggested wording change has been made. The Werker and Hensch 2015 AnnRev
review article has not been added, however, since it concerns the biological viability of the notion
of critical period, which is a different issue than the precise order of what is going on in the
course of the first year of life. For this paragraph we prefer to stick with the Johnson (also 2015,
also AnnRev!) review as an overview of the current state of this latter debate, and also refer to
the original and now classic discoveries that launched the debate.
16. page 7, line 16: can the authors clarify what they mean here by "remain useful" and provide
references? (i.e., useful for re-learning the L1? In the case of L2 learning you could argue that in
some ways persistent representations might be useful, in that they have some basis for language
they can work with, but in other ways they might interfere, because they have to learn a new set
of language sounds on top of a previously existing one, though this is not necessary to get into if
the authors are just referring to L1 re-learning)
<U+F086> A general modification has qualified this point. The Baese-Berk and Samuel study discussed
in the Gen.Disc. indeed indicates that R2’s intuition here is correct.
17. page 7, line 22: "...that has now convincingly established a relearning advantage." Is it the
case that a relearning advantage has been convincingly established? I think it would be helpful to
see the authors' "under review" work to support this point more strongly. But without that, due to
factors such as small and heterogeneous sample sizes and training conditions (e.g., university
courses) that have been reported in other papers, and effects that are limited to certain aspects
of language but not others, I think we can only say at this point that there is some evidence for a
re-learning advantage. Although in fact I think this change in wording strengthens your study as
you can put greater emphasis on what your training paradigm has brought to the previous
research on this topic - you are part of "convincingly establishing" a re-learning advantage.
<U+F086> We have changed this wording.
18. page 7, line 50/53: "If abstract phonological representations..." This is a valuable and
interesting idea to test! Might be helpful to highlight this argument explicitly throughout as it
makes the jump from an interesting pattern observed in adoptees to a more general underlying
principle of how the brain acquires language sounds and how those are used over time in
different ways.
<U+F086> See responses to R1 on this point. This is now more clearly the central theme of the paper.
We have also included additional data concerning generalisation to untrained places of
articulation that further strengthens our claim.
19. page 8, line 13: why was there such a big gap in ages for the adoptees? That is, half of the
adoptees were adopted before 6 months, and half after 17 months. Why was there no one
adopted between 6 and 17 months? Were the groups selected on purpose in this way? Is there
some other explanation? This would be helpful to explicate - and could be done in the method
section as opposed to here where the groups are first introduced.
<U+F086> The groups in fact reflect the available population. The first wave of Korean adoption cleared
the orphanages of a mixed age range of available children. Once overseas adoption became an
accepted option, and the Netherlands was established as a destination, children were made
available at an earlier age, and Dutch families made their preferences clear too (the younger the
better, and female). This may not be appropriate for inclusion. We have adapted the text (p.10) to
make clear that the population itself offered this option.
20. page 8, line 15: Do you have any information about their language abilities at adoption? If so
this would be helpful to include either in the paper or in supplementary materials
<U+F086> No, we have no such relevant information. However, since all participants were said to be
rated as healthy and typically developing, we think it is safe to assume that none of the 5-month-
olds or younger had a vocabulary and all of the 17-month-olds or older had at least some words.
Methods
21. page 9, line 28: Is the convention 5;10 with a semi-colon, as opposed to 5:10 with a colon?
<U+F086> This change has been made.
22. page 9, line 33: How was it determined that no adoptees had attempted to learn Korean after
adoption?
<U+F086> This was a criterion for participation, explicitly mentioned in our recruitment advertisement, and
explicitly checked during screening (via email or phone call).
23. page 9, line 40: Trips to Korea are reported, but is there any information on whether they
were exposed to Korean in their adoption country (e.g., through community, language courses,
friends)? Again, as above, if the information is available it would be helpful to have a more
thorough/quantitative description of participants' language environments either here or in
supplementary materials.
<U+F086> Both Korean adoptees and Dutch controls reported that they had not taken Korean classes,
had no one who spoke with them in Korean, and had been rarely exposed to Korean by chance
(e.g., at Korean restaurants). Note that unlike the US, the Netherlands does not have localised
Korean neighbourhoods anywhere.
24. page 10, line 8: Have you looked to see whether there is a difference in performance for the
adoptees who had visited Korea and those who had not (could do this same comparison for
Dutch-speakers as well, since they also had trips to Korea)? Was there any advantage for the
group who already had some re-exposure? (This might provide an interesting contrast between
passive exposure and active training)
<U+F086> In control analyses, we tested the effect of Korean visit on adoptees’ performance by carrying
out correlations between the adoptees’ accuracy and rating scores in Time 1 and 2 productions
on one hand, and visit ratio and visits to Korea on the other hand. The null results may be found
in the SI.
25. page 10, line 49: could demographic information for native-speaker controls be included
somewhere, perhaps in Table S1?
<U+F086> We have the native controls’ age and sex information but no other demographic information;
the age and sex information are described in the text. We did not collect further information
because we were not testing how demographic factors might influence Korean controls’
performance in the present study (although it could be an interesting research topic in other
research areas) and also because we had no reason to expect that their identification accuracy
and rating scores would differ as a function of any demographic factor.
26. page 12, paragraph starting line 9: Is there any way to verify that the groups completed the
training to an equal extent? That is, is there any possibility that one of the groups was more
motivated and so completed all the training sessions, while the other group did not? Can you
know whether they actually completed each session (and/or how many they did complete)?
<U+F086> The computers that we provided logged all session data including time that sessions were
undertaken. This is now noted in the text.
27. page 13, line 11: reference 28 did not have any perceptual training
<U+F086> This sentence has disappeared as a result of the shortening of the perceptual description in
the methods section.
28. page 13, line 32: It would be helpful to be able to see this data. Is there a way to include a
summary figure or table in supplementary info? Or is it likely that the "under review" manuscript
will be reported prior to this paper?
<U+F086> We cannot include data from the perceptual paper for copyright reasons, but it is to be hoped
that both papers will soon be in the literature! If the reviewer would care to read the dissertation
(Choi 2014, ref. [34]) which formed the initial report, a copy can be sent via the RSOS office.
29. page 14, line 46: Why was the last token of the second repetition chosen? Why was it that
the last or first token of the third repetitions were chosen instead (as opposed to some other
token) in cases where the last token of the second repetition could not be used?
<U+F086> The production task had no practice trials and we considered the first repetition as practice. It
would of course have been ideal to include all tokens, but practically this was impossible
because we could not ask participants to do the judgement tasks for several hours, nor could we,
for practical reasons, test huge numbers of participants (already we needed 60 for the present
design). There was no theoretical reason for choosing the last token of the second repetition and
we believe that it would not greatly matter which token we had chosen for the evaluations as long
as it was consistent across all groups. The reason why we picked the tokens of the last repetition
rather than picked other tokens of the second repetition when the last token of the second
repetition could not be used is that most of the time other tokens of the second repetition also
could not be used due to similar reasons; especially, background noise, which was hard to
control fully in our experimental settings, tended if present to affect all tokens of any given
repetition.
30. page 16, line 3: (page 15 not 16) Is there any background information on the raters aside
from age and gender? Is there any difference in, for example, academic background that might
influence how they rated the samples? And, if so, were rater characteristics distributed evenly
across the groups that were rated?
<U+F086> We didn’t collect further information other than their age and sex. But the raters were Hanyang
University students since we advertised on campus. Importantly, however, each rater evaluated
an entire set (among 3 sets) which contained all critical stops from all speakers in each sample
(as reported in 2.3.2). We did this indeed to prevent the possibility that raters with certain
characteristics could be assigned to a certain group by chance.
Results
31. page 16, line 32: why were the mean proportions arcsine transformed?
<U+F086> An arcsine transformation is commonly used for proportion data, which are derived from
counts, to help to compensate for the fact that proportion data are bounded between 1 and 0.
The raw proportions, however, yielded the same significance patterns: effect of Group (F1,27=28.2,
p<.001), effect of Time (F1,27=170.7, p<.001), Group by Time interaction (F1,27=5.1, p=.033),
Group effect on Time 1 (F1,27=3.0, n.s.), and Group effect on Time 2 (F1,27=22.7, p<.001).
32. page 16, line 42: When describing "sample" it might be helpful to say something like pre/post
training instead of just sample 1 and 2 to make it very clear where the samples were taken from
and what you are comparing
<U+F086> See response to R1. The terminology has been changed.
33. page 18, line 54: Why do you think older current age was related to worse utterance ratings?
<U+F086> The only reason we can think of is that the younger you are, the closer you are to being a
student which requires you to perform tasks such as repetition. This explanation at least has the
advantage of predicting that it would hold true for any population anywhere.
34. page 20, line 34: Is there any added benefit of doing a regression analysis instead of a
correlation analysis? That is, could you use regression to see whether perceptual results (or
degree of improvement across perceptual training) predict production results (controlling for your
other variables), and then see if this is moderated by adoption status (i.e., is there a relationship
between perception and production for the adoptee group only)? The way you currently have it
set up could it not be the case that participants who were better “producers” were better at
learning, leading to the same pattern of results? Also, are there any issues with restricted range
in the Dutch group, or more variability in the adoptee group, that could be leading to significant
correlations observed in one group but not the other?
<U+F086> We thank the reviewer for the regression analysis suggestion, which indeed displayed exactly
the pattern predicted by the reviewer – a strong relationship for the adoptees but not for the
controls. This analysis can be seen in the SI.
As for the issue of innate ability, note that this was addressed in our published control study
(Choi et al. 2015, ref. [37]) which showed that adoptees and controls did not differ on simple
same-different judgements. It is in any case unlikely that (or difficult to account for if) adopted
children in general have better speech ability of any kind than non-adopted children. As applied
specifically to an innate difference in ability to produce sounds, please note that the productions
at Time 1 showed no adoptee-control difference. We do not understand the suggestion about
restricted range in one group compared to the other, given that the groups were carefully
matched on pretty much everything we could think of.
General Discussion
35. page 21, line 29: I think it’s more accurate to say that native listeners identified the target
sounds produced by the adoptee group more accurately (rather than more easily identified) than
the sounds produced by the controls
<U+F086> This change has been made.
36. page 21, line 34: “Both groups of participants did their best in all the tasks…” Do you have
evidence for this?
<U+F086> As noted in response to R1, this has been deleted.
37. page 22, line 23/25: If there is, in general, a relationship between perception and production
(as you have cited earlier), why do you think it is the case that no relationship was seen in the
Dutch group after training? Would you predict that the Dutch group might need more extensive
training, and at that point a relationship would be observed? Or would a relationship never be
observed because the Dutch group has no early experience with Korean sounds, and it is those
early established perceptual representations that are crucial for this relationship?
<U+F086> We suspect that if the Dutch group persisted in learning Korean a relationship would become
perceptible but whether or not it is the same relationship for adult learners as for infant learners is
an issue going beyond our study, and indeed beyond the domain of the literature we refer to.
38. page 23, line 34-39: “…although at six months the phonemic repertoire of the environmental
language does not yet support language-specific phoneme discrimination.” Can the authors
clarify what they mean by this point?
<U+F086> The Werker & Lalonde reference appears again that was used in our earlier discussion of this
point, so we have modified the sentence to emphasise that this is the result we refer to.
39. page 23 last paragraph/page 24 first paragraph: Could this paragraph be made clearer?
There are references that support how infants establish a distribution of phonetic contrasts (e.g.,
from Patricia Kuhl, and from Maye, Werker and Gerken (2002) and Yoshida, Pons, Maye, &
Werker (2010) that might be useful here.
<U+F086> This paragraph is a general lead-in to the next, that is now (as requested) a much more
detailed account of the rival interpretations, with many more references.
40. page 24, paragraph beginning line 19: Can the authors provide citations for these different
accounts? It would also provide clarity if the paragraph began by explaining that, although the
study provides evidence that native language representations are retained, the nature of what is
retained is unclear, and then go on to provide accounts of these models that might explain the
mechanisms underlying such retention.
<U+F086> As noted just above, this has been done.
41. page 26, line 33/35: “…not veridical memory traces of accrued exposures, but rather an
abstraction from those early exposures.” Could it be a combination? In order to apply an abstract
rule, do you not also need to know when to apply the rule (e.g., to know that x contrast can be
split into 3 but y contrast can only split into 2 the listener needs to have some representation of
the sounds that lead to those rules). It may be that I am misunderstanding this paragraph, though.
<U+F086> It is true that all models account best for some aspect of the data. Unless one were to assume
that infants are actually born with some abstract knowledge about language (and even the most
diehard proponents of this have more recently been involved in arguing how it could be derived
from the input – see, e.g., Iris Berent’s collaborations with Janet Werker!), then the first that an
infant knows is derived from the first exposure episodes. The episodic account is strongest in
that very initial phase. Its limitations arise when it tries to account for all the evidence that is most
parsimoniously accounted for by assuming an ability to generalise across instances rather than
simply weighing their accumulation. Distributional learning models are abstractionist in fact, since
episodic accounts of evidence for distributional knowledge (representing accumulation) are also
less parsimonious than a pure distributional account (directly representing distributions). In R2’s
example, we would assume that the “representation of the sounds” is also abstract, in that
models of the knowledge of phonetic contrasts have always been viewed as abstract. In the long
run, we agree with R2 that the full account probably contains a combination of types of
processing. Our point here, however, is simply to stress that some abstraction is needed to
account for our data.
42. page 27, final line: I think you could add a sentence or two at the end to relate what you have
found to the general idea that very early experiences have a lasting impact on different aspects
of language over time, as a way of moving beyond the findings with adoptees to their more
general implications for language development.
<U+F086> We have done this, and we thank the reviewer once again.
Figures & Tables
43. For the plots on identification accuracy and ratings across time points could the authors add
a plot to show each participant’s improvement over samples? E.g., have a plot for KA with time 1
and time 2, show all individual data points (as you have in panel b of your figures), and have
lines connecting time 1 to time 2 for each participant as an indicator of the number of participants
who showed improvement and by how much (and then repeat that figure for DC)? I think a plot
like that would illustrate the degree to which the KA group showed greater improvement than the
DC group as a result of training, though I am not sure of the journal’s restrictions on number of
figures.
<U+F086> These figures look somewhat crowded but do show that in general the adoptees nearly all
improved on both measures, while the DC are a mixed bag: some improve, some stay the same,
some get worse, and the improvement is less steep than for the adoptees. This is in line with the
pattern of results in the by-listener analyses. We have included these figures also in the SI.
Table S2
44. How do the authors explain the finding that pre-training samples are correlated with
identification accuracy and ratings if the argument is that training facilitates adoptees’ use of
perception in production? Can you rule out the fact that some people might be better producers
from the start, and those are the ones who do better in the training? Or do you think there could
be some effect of having been exposed to Korean in the adoptee group that makes them
somewhat better at producing Korean sounds even before training (but that this is improved with
training)?
<U+F086> See response to R1’s comment no. 8. It is probably transfer from the early perceptual learning
(given that production depends on perception in the first place). If it were simply that some
people are better producers and then do better in training, then surely such a trend should show
up in the Dutch control group too.
