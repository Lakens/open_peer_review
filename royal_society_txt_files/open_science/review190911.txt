This excellent and well-written manuscript provides a thorough description of an important new
sponge with remarkable preservational fidelity. The novel combination of characteristics
observed is skilfully applied to the emerging picture of sponge origins. The phylogenetic
interpretations proposed are well defended, precise and clear; ambiguities are carefully
considered, and the conclusions are measured and well justified. I have no hesitation in
recommending the manuscript for publication.
I can see little in the manuscript that might be improved, but have a couple of minor suggestions.
The mixture of form-taxonomy with formal taxonomy makes me a little uncomfortable. If
‘Reticulosa’ may be polyphyletic, is it necessary to assign the genus to an Order at all, rather than
leaving it in open nomenclature? This said, the paraphyletic ‘Reticulosa’ envisaged in Fig. 7
clearly has some taxonomic value.
P3L1. Suggest removing ‘both’ to avoid ambiguity (were both spicules preserved, as well as soft
tissue?)
P4L32. ‘stem-group’ requires a subject; all fossils are by definition in some stem group. Suggest
removing ‘stem-group’ or specifying ‘fossils from the stem-group of X’.
P9L26. Is it worth specifying the evidence that this is calcite, rather than any other polymorph of
CaCO<sub>3</sub>? Presumably the presence of Ca alone does not discount ankerite? I
wonder whether there might be value in mentioning the number of specimens in which
mineralogy has been determined, to assuage possible concerns that the absence of ankerite or
primary silica may reflect a chance variation in taphonomic regime.
P10L30. The authors may wish to consider discussing the carbonaceous hexactine spicules
described by Harvey (2010, Biology Letters) as examples of semi-rigid non-mineralized
(demineralized?) spicules.
Fig 1. The density of panels is very high, making it difficult to benefit from the stereo pairs; could
these be given a little more room, such that they can be viewed more comfortably?

Dear Editors of the Royal Society
The paper: “Three-dimensionally preserved soft-tissues and calcareous hexactins in a Silurian
sponge: implications for early sponge evolution” is an important contribution to the knowledge
of the early evolutionary history of the Phylum Porifera.
The authors present compiling evidence for an original biomineralization of hexactinellid
spicules “calci-hexactines” that confirm the new vision of the early evolution of sponges with
diffuse limits among Classes, in contrast to the well differentiated taxonomy among extant
sponges. Besides, they show with a 3D technic the organic preservation of the wall morphology
including internal chambers, which is extremely rare among fossil sponge preservation.
I think the paper is of broad interest among paleontologists and neontologist.
Minor suggestions:
A location map and column could improve to visualize the geology of the area for open scope
readers.
An additional paragraph showing previous thoughts about the explanation for taphonomic
replacement of silica by calcite in sponges could help also the non-familiarized readers.
Sincerely,
Marcelo G. Carrera

Appendix A
Dear Kevin,
We thank the two reviewers for their enthusiastic endorsement. Responses to their particular
comments and suggestions are presented below (in bold). All changes to the manuscript have been
tracked; some changes are minor editorial tweaks of wording rather than responses to reviewers, so
we have identified changes made in response to review by highlighting in yellow. As requested, we
also provide a clean version of the manuscript with all tracking and highlighting removed.
Please note that while the instructions we receive ask for the supplementary information to be in
final form, ours still includes highlighted slots for the final published DOI and year, as of course we
cannot provide these at present.
Best wishes,
Mark Sutton

The mixture of form-taxonomy with formal taxonomy makes me a little uncomfortable. If ‘Reticulosa’
may be polyphyletic, is it necessary to assign the genus to an Order at all, rather than leaving it in open
nomenclature? This said, the paraphyletic ‘Reticulosa’ envisaged in Fig. 7 clearly has some taxonomic
value.
As the reviewer notes, the paraphyletic ‘Reticulosa’ retains some pratical value as a label, and hence
we prefer to retain it as-is in our manuscript. Workers on fossil sponges need to have a concept of
what a reticulosan is; we feel that removing it from our taxonomy would degrade the utility of our
work. While of course we agree that paraphyletic taxa are not desirable, we prefer to indicate this
through open taxonomy and discussion, rather than simply to excise the name.
P3L1. Suggest removing ‘both’ to avoid ambiguity (were both spicules preserved, as well as soft tissue?)
Fixed ('both' removed as suggested)
P4L32. ‘stem-group’ requires a subject; all fossils are by definition in <i>some</i> stem group. Suggest
removing ‘stem-group’ or specifying ‘fossils from the stem-group of X’.
Fixed ('stem-group' removed to resolve the tautology)
P9L26. Is it worth specifying the evidence that this is calcite, rather than any other polymorph of
CaCO<sub>3</sub>? Presumably the presence of Ca alone does not discount ankerite? I wonder whether
there might be value in mentioning the number of specimens in which mineralogy has been determined, to
assuage possible concerns that the absence of ankerite or primary silica may reflect a chance variation in
taphonomic regime.
The text does state that calcite is evident optically. Without complex crystallographic work there is
no simple way to differentiate calcite from aragonite, but these two polymorphs are relatively
straightforward to distinguish optically. Aragonite is in any case unstable geologically, and would be
very unexpected in a Palaeozoic fossil. No other polymorphs of calcite occur geologically. As the
reviewer points out, Ca alone does not discount ankerite, but the spicules are also depleted in iron,
which should be present in ankerite. Elemental mapping was only performed on two specimens, but
all specimens examined by eye show calcite-preservation of spicules (a specimen count is already
provided). We have modified this paragraph to clarify these points.
P10L30. The authors may wish to consider discussing the carbonaceous hexactine spicules described by
Harvey (2010, Biology Letters) as examples of semi-rigid non-mineralized (demineralized?) spicules.
We thank the reviewer for suggesting this paper, and have added a mention. These spicules are
interpreted by the original author as organic sheaths encasing a mineralised (but not fossilised)
spicule, so do not change the direction of our discussion – but the paper should certainly be
cited as we have done.
Fig 1. The density of panels is very high, making it difficult to benefit from the stereo pairs; could these be
given a little more room, such that they can be viewed more comfortably?
There is little scope to give any more room without shrinking the images; we have published many
similar plates before (in Royal Society journals), including others denser than this, and the stereo-
pair separation is on a par with that we have used previously. We have re-checked to confirm that
the stereo-pairs work perfectly well; any resizing would risk impairing the stereo effect.
Note that abbreviations are out of order in the caption (cc before co).

A location map and column could improve to visualize the geology of the area for open scope readers.
We prefer not to provide these, having published many papers on elements of this fauna without
them. This information belongs in a review article instead, and we have just submitted one such to
the Journal of the Geological Society. We could add a citation to this at proof stage, assuming it is in-
press by then.
An additional paragraph showing previous thoughts about the explanation for taphonomic replacement of
silica by calcite in sponges could help also the non-familiarized readers.
We are not claiming any replacement of silica by calcite in the paper. We do claim a replacement of
silica by ankerite, but we already discuss this, providing references. We do also briefly mention that
some ‘Calcihexactina’ occurrences may represent replacement of silica by calcite, but to the best of
our knowledge no taphonomic mechanism for this has been proposed, and speculation about this is
beyond the scope of this paper.
