This is a remarkable discovery and the evidence is carefully considered. It appears to show
conclusive evidence that Silesaurus, a close relative of the first dinosaurs ate beetles, and that it
selected particular types of beetle. Hitherto, from its anatomy most palaeontologists would have
assumed it targeted small tetrapods as its main food. The evidence comes from multiple
examples of coprolites which the authors have examined using state-of-the-art methods. They
make convincing arguments that the coprolites come from Silesaurus, and so make the link.
Pages 5-6: In assigning the coprolites to Silesaurus, say more about the relative distributions of
coprolites and bones of this animal between the two fossiliferous level in which both were found.
Also, say more about proportions of the skeletal taxa and proportions of the coprolite types –
small sample sizes, I know, but this might be informative.
Page 7: I’m not sure about the statement that the supposedly bird-like braincase implies
Silesaurus had ‘bird-like feeding behaviour’, Unless you can make a clear and plausible causal
connection between the two – i.e. which aspect of the braincase is actually bird-like and is there
published data to show this uniquely houses a part of the brain associated with whatever you
mean by ‘bird-like feeding behaviour’. Otherwise, drop all this and the figure – I think it's all
irrelevant (Page 7, lines 11-32).
Page 7, line 32: You flip from braincase to teeth in the same paragraph; move the tooth stuff to the
material about Silesaurus feeding – former views, current views, evidence in the teeth and jaws
that they ate beetles.
Page 9, line 11: I’ve never heard Silesauridae were paraphyletic – all the recent, authoritative
cladistic analyses make them a clade and their relationships are clear – e.g. papers by Nesbitt,
Irmis, etc. Omit this or explain why (with evidence) you reject the recent phylogenetic papers.
Maybe consider whether this could be a seasonal diet for Silesaurus – feeding on beetles when
they are abundant, and coprolites all date from the same season of the year? Yes or no?

Revision of the Royal Society Open Science manuscript ID RSOS-181042
Title: Beetle-bearing coprolites possibly reveal the diet of a Late Triassic dinosauriform (by Qvarnström et
al.).
The manuscript of Martin Qvarnström and col. is suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science
and will have high impact with important paleobiological implications.
The manuscript is apparently well written although honesty I do not feel empowered to perform the English
language due to I am not an Anglophone.
The paper is a very solid piece of work, in line with recent papers published by them. This shows precisely
how the developed of coprology is essential for the knowledge of palaeobiology, palaeophysiology,
palaeocommunities, and ancient ecosystems. Although some of the information has been published
recently (Qvarnström et al. 2017 - DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-02893-9), I think it is extremely necessary
beforehand to develop these kind of coprology studies.
Despite this, I can do some comments and improve as well some aspects of the manuscript.
General remarks:
Scientifically the manuscript is solid, well-structured and organized, although the objectives are not clearly
stated at the end of the introductory section.
Is well written in a clear and concise way and having a well development across the text. The title is well,
reflecting clearly the work content, and the study, its findings and conclusions are clear in the abstract.
However, the rest of the manuscript presents some minor problems to be considered and discussed; for
that reason, I made just some comments and revisions that must be addressed in the main text before its
publication.
Specific comments
- At the end of the introductory section, the objectives are not clearly stated.
- It necessary to justify more accurately why the coprolite belonged to the dinosauriform Silesaurus and
not, for example, to the aetosaur Stagonolepis olenkae. Recently, Drózdz (2018 - DOI
10.7717/peerj.5595) suggested that this aetosaur could have been omnivore, specialized in
coleopterans, and having produced the same coprolite (and was found in the same levels).
- So, this is directly linked to the conclusions and implications about the suggested diet for
dinosauriformes. This is the main problem, because the results justify the interpretations and
conclusions, but could also justify other interpretations, such as the coprolite producer could be
another species of archosaur (case discarded). In this sense, the authors must support their
conclusions more strongly.
- I suggest including a supplementary with videos and interactive 3D views of the coprolites.
Page 1, lines 30-31: …however, also CAN reflect the…
Page 4, lines 23-24: The terrestrial community was composed of small reptiles… Could you be more
precise in that assignment?
Page 6, line 11: check reference format.
Page 6, line 45: this is not in tune with the suggestions of Drózdz (2018), and it is precisely the
weakness of the manuscript.
Note on this regard: I think too that the precursors of dinosaurs (e.g., dinosauriformes) would have
been omnivorous and their diet constituted mostly by arthropods; in fact I think that the Triassic
trophic chains initially were supported by arthropods (and plants, of course), but I observe that
there is an equal support (Silesaurus / Stagonolepis) towards the producer of the coprolites.
Page 8, line 48: check reference format.
Final comment:
Again, and so to summarize, I like to point out that the manuscript is very interesting and the science here
is great. Qvarnström et al.’s manuscript is very reasonable and I look forward to seeing it published in
Royal Society Open Science but just after some key and necessary revisions.

Specific comments
- At the end of the introductory section, the objectives are not clearly stated.
This is now added.
- It necessary to justify more accurately why the coprolite belonged to the
dinosauriform Silesaurus and not, for example, to the aetosaur Stagonolepis
olenkae. Recently, Drózdz (2018 - DOI 10.7717/peerj.5595) suggested that this
aetosaur could have been omnivore, specialized in coleopterans, and having
produced the same coprolite (and was found in the same levels).
Drózdz (2018) analyzed the forelimbs of Stagonolepis and inferred probable
adaptations to scratch digging. In the same paper, Drózdz (2018) discussed the diet
of recent scratch-diggers and concluded that the large size of Stagonolepis suggest a
diet/feeding strategy more similar to wild bores than to such, much smaller,
insectivorous scratch diggers. We believe too, that Stagonolepis was probably too
big to have produced these small coprolites, and specifically targeted such small
beetles (we added this more clearly in the manuscript now, and referenced this
paper). More likely, it had a diverse menu.
- So, this is directly linked to the conclusions and implications about the suggested
diet for dinosauriformes. This is the main problem, because the results justify the
interpretations and conclusions, but could also justify other interpretations, such as
the coprolite producer could be another species of archosaur (case discarded). In
this sense, the authors must support their conclusions more strongly.
We have in the coprolite collection from Krasiejów specimens which probably
represent fossilized dungs of Stagonolepis. More on this topic will be in the next
publication (in prep.) with a description of all specimens from the site.
- I suggest including a supplementary with videos and interactive 3D views of the
coprolites.

show conclusive evidence that Silesaurus, a close relative of the first dinosaurs ate

The evidence comes from multiple examples of coprolites which the authors have

Supplemented.

Corrected and improved.
Page 7, line 32: You flip from braincase to teeth in the same paragraph; move the
tooth stuff to the material about Silesaurus feeding – former views, current views,
evidence in the teeth and jaws that they ate beetles.
This is now separated into two different paragraphs.

Maybe consider whether this could be a seasonal diet for Silesaurus – feeding on
beetles when they are abundant, and coprolites all date from the same season of the
year? Yes or no?
We have no data from the coprolites that suggest they were all produced during the
same season. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that this beetle-dominated diet was
seasonal (in the same way we cannot exclude dietary components that simply were
not preserved/entering the coprolites). This is a good suggestion that is now
incorporated in the manuscript.
