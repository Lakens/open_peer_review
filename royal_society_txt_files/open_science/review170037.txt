Summary
In this paper the authors describe a quasi-experimental, survey-based study in which 1347
Swedish residents of six urban locations provided ratings of: perceptions of the site in response to
greenery-related sounds, perceptions of bird song, and the importance of nature sounds, trees,
and plants for perception of bird species. These ratings were analysed based on post-hoc
groupings according to naturalness of the urban locations (high, low), gender (male, female), and
age (young, middle-aged, older). High naturalness, female gender, and age were significantly
related to increased sound-based perception of the site, importance of bird song, and important
of nature sounds and greenery for perceptions of bird species. The authors discuss these findings
in the context of urban greenery conservation, the need for gender perspectives in planning and
conservation processes, and age differences in perceptions and use of and, access to, nature.
General
This paper adds to the growing, but still relatively undeveloped, field of acoustic experiences of
natural environments as calming or otherwise psychologically beneficial. It encourages the reader
to consider these experiences in the context of individual differences, as well as environmental
differences, and I think this is a strength of the paper. The question of how different age groups
experience nature as beneficial is under-examined but becoming ever more relevant in an ageing
society. While this paper addresses important questions, I observe several limitations in the paper
which I detail below. These focus largely on the theoretical rationale for the study, and the
methodological choices taken with regard to measures and analyses. As such I believe the paper
requires major revisions.
Introduction
p. 3, lines 62-65: In Ratcliffe et al. (2013) participants did not rank sounds themselves on the
potential for stress-reduction. This analysis was carried out by the paper’s authors, who counted
frequency of mention per sound type across all participant interviews, where sounds were
mentioned in relation to stress recovery and/or attention restoration. Bird sounds emerged as the
type of sound most frequently mentioned in this context (see Ratcliffe et al., 2013, p. 224). Please
amend these sentences as appropriate.
p. 4, lines 69 – 76: This section requires further rationale. Why is it important and/or interesting
to analyse differences in sound perceptions as a function of age and gender? What are the
possible implications of these kinds of analyses?
p. 4, lines 77 – 78: The dependent variables are introduced here but I miss explanation of why
these specific variables are of interest. The variable “perception” is not tightly defined (further on
expanded as “assessments of greenery-related sounds” but this could mean many things), so I
don’t really understand what the aims and hypotheses of the study are at this point.
Method
p. 5, line 101: Rename this section to “Participants”.
p. 5, lines 102-110: I miss information on informed consent procedures, and how the study was
conducted in accordance with relevant ethical guidelines.
p. 7-8, lines 140-161: How were the dependent variable items developed and tested, and what
was the rationale for using these items (linking back to my point about p. 4, lines 77-78)? At
present there is little context for these measures, particularly as they do not seem drawn from any
previously used or published scales. I find the “perception of bird species” items particularly
hard to interpret; perception of birds in what way? Positive or negative, or number of bird species
present, etc.? Internal consistencies of the three measures are high so I would also recommend
3
testing structures via factor analysis and, if appropriate, averaging them to produce a single score
per measure (reducing the need for MANOVA).
p. 8, lines 173-175: There appears to be some formatting error here (see line 175). But moreover I
miss information regarding the “averaged evaluations of the respondents” in relation to
naturalness. Where is this reported and how were these evaluations made?
Results
p. 9, line 198: Please report all results, significant and non-significant.
p. 10, line 206: If I understand the results correctly then “sounds of nature”, unlikely rustling trees
and birdsong, is not related to higher calmness but to enhanced perceptions of the site. Please
clarify.
p. 11-13, throughout: Since the age variable comprises three groupings, post-hoc comparisons are
required. At present the findings show that scores on the DVs differ as a function of age, but it is
not clear which age groups this relates to.
Discussion
p. 14, line 290: In what way do the results show that visual and audible perception are connected?
Can you unpack this sentence a bit? This occurs again on p. 15, lines 300-302 where combination
of visual and auditory perceptions are again mentioned. I miss discussion earlier in the paper of
how visual perceptions are relevant; if this relates to perceived naturalness then it should be
introduced earlier.
p. 14, lines 296-297: Is this a significant difference, relevant to the aims of the study? I miss
analyses where scores on items regarding bird song and trees were compared to those regarding
human voices and noise.
p. 15, line 303: I think “enhanced” too strongly implies causality that cannot be supported by the
study design. I would suggest rephrasing to “was related to”.
p. 16, line 343-344: “… effects on gender…” Unless the survey had a very profound impact on
participants, I suspect there is a typo here! :) Please amend to, “Perceptions of natural sounds
differ by gender in a similar way to visual perceptions of urban greenery…” or similar.
p. 17, line 347-348: Where is this gender comparison of preference reported?
p. 17, line 367: Is “well-being” the right terminology? This does not appear as one of the
dependent variables.
p. 17, lines 367-375: I recommend that this section be reframed in order to be more explanatory of
the findings at hand, rather than descriptive. At present it relies heavily on the argument that
women are more emotionally labile, but this appears speculative in light of the data provided by
the study (which is not about emotion per se).
With regard to findings re age and gender, have the authors considered more proximal
explanations? For example, increased time spent in nearby nature amongst the elderly and
women who work in the home (cf. de Vries et al., 2003, doi: 10.1068/a35111 – the authors may
wish to cite this paper in support of their assertion on p. 18, line 379-380), and relative concerns
about personal safety in nature amongst women (cf. Hartig et al., 1998.
http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02815739808730463; Richardson & Mitchell, 2007,
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.04.015) which might be a possible explanation for
why the presence of voices was perceived as calming by female participants in this study). See
also Astell-Burt et al., 2014 (doi:10.1136/jech-2013-203767) for a discussion on interactions
between age and gender in regard to benefits of green space across the lifespan. Further
4
consideration of the existing literature on this topic would also help to strengthen the rationale
for studying age and gender as put forward in the Introduction.
p. 21, line 440: Is “well-being” an appropriate term here?
Figures
p. 36-43: Please add error bars to Figures 3 to 10 representing standard deviations.
Research ethics
p. 32, line 687-688: The second sentence doesn’t make sense, please rephrase and include
information about the ethical approval or guidelines, as well as procedures for informed consent,
that were followed.

Please correct the spelling of names in certain author references; e.g. Ratcliffe, not Ratcliff.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This paper presents an interesting and novel study on natural sound perception in urban
greenery. The authors demonstrate sound knowledge and awareness of the state-of-art in the
field and some of the existing research gaps. In general I find this work acceptable for
publication, but the authors will need to make some revisions, especially in describing their study
design and methodology, as well as showing that they are aware of some of the weaknesses of
their approach. Below I will present some comments for the different sections of the paper.
TITLE:
'Natural sound perception' could evoke some confusion, as it could be interpreted in different
ways (e.g., some people have a 'natural' way of perceiving sounds). I would suggest to change
this to 'Perception of natural sounds'.

ABSTRACT:
Line 22: why not mention that the Swedish city is Gothenburg?
The final part of the abstract presents study findings. However, I would like to see some of the
'terminology' and phrasing used here which is used in the paper itself. For example, using the
term 'naturalness' would make sense. The current text is very general and perhaps does not fully
link up to the paper's aims and research questions.
Line 25: "perception ratings". This relates to a more general criticism that I have concerning how
the term 'perception' is used rather loosely throughout the paper. What is really meant with
'perception' in this paper? See my later comments.
INTRODUCTION
Line 51: "like sights". Perhaps change to "like natural sights"?
Line 53 etc: I think that you need to provide a bit more information about the specific results of
this study, which is one of the few to date combining visual and sound aspects.
Line 55, 57: two sentences in a row start with 'Thus'. Please edit.
METHOD
A main problem I have with the paper is that some assumptions are not really made explicit. For
example, six groups of people were surveyed. All groups are linked to a specific green space and
level of naturalness, as they live close to this area. However, did you control whether people were
also using these nearby green spaces? In some cases they might hardly be aware of them - and
travel elsewhere for a preferred green experience. I would also like to see response rates broken
down for the six subgroups. Are there differences in the willingness to respond of the groups?
Are low response rates for some groups impacting the validity of the study?
Line 113 etc.: I would suggest to present the information here as a list, for readability reasons.
Line 145: what does the phrasing "...give me a stronger perception of the site" mean? See my
earlier comment about the use of 'perception'. How was this explained in Swedish? To me
perception here could mean different things, varying from 'impression' to 'experience'. You need
to make this more clear to avoid misunderstandings.
See also line 159 etc.: "Trees are important to my perception of bird species in the area".
Perception in what sense??
Line 172 etc.: can you explain why you distinguished three age groups only? How did you select
the three categories?
RESULTS
Line 205: once again, it is unclear what is meant with 'my perception of the area'.
DISCUSSION
In line with some of my comments on the study design and method, you will probably need to
provide a more critical insight into study weaknesses and potential bias.
Line 284: is it really true that "areas with perceived high naturalness were linked to more positive
nature-sound-related perception...", or is it rather so that people living near areas with perceived
high naturalness demonstrated more positive nature-sound related perceptions?
Line 343: the phrasing here is wrong, as natural sounds does not have an impact on gender (i.e. it
cannot change gender!), but it is rather so that differences can be noted in nature sound
perception between the genders.
6
Line 379 etc.: there could be some other generational aspects at play here, i.e. larger shares of the
older population having grown up in more natural settings, and thus having higher appreciation
of nature. Other studies (e.g. Anna Adevi's PhD work at SLU) have touched upon the importance
of upbringing in more natural surroundings.
FIGURES
Figures 4, 5, 6, 7: you need to rephrase some of the caption texts, i.e. not "effect of gender/age on
sounds, ..." but rather their effect on the perception of ... See e.g. Fig. 8: age does not have an
impact on birdsong itself, but rather on the perception and appreciation of it.

Dear Authors,
Thank you for the revised version of your manuscript, "Estimations of natural sounds in urban
greenery - potential impact for urban nature preservation", which I enjoyed reading. I think the
manuscript has improved. I still have some outstanding concerns from my previous review
which I detail below. I think these can be addressed by minor revisions to the text.
- Author comment: The concept of perception is replaced throughout the text with “estimations”
or “experiences”. Further, “assessments of greenery-related sounds” is changed to “ratings of
greenery related sound”.
- My response: I still struggle with this terminology. Estimation = a rough calculation of the
amount or quantity of greenery-related sounds? Or a judgment of the value of the greenery-
related sounds? The problem to me appears to be that the different items used in the scale cover
so many “estimations” or “perceptions” that finding one term to accurately describe what they
are all measuring is a challenge, with the result that the term “estimation” says very little. What
are the DVs measuring, exactly? Some of them appear to relate to perceptions of calmness, some
relate to stronger/weaker perceptions of the are as a whole, some relate to importance of hearing
bird sounds, and some relate to the importance of experiencing the presence of birds per se. In
keeping with the use of MANOVA to measure different latent variables, I think it would be much
better to describe these different variables accurately and individually, rather than try to
categorise them all together as “estimations”. I note that the DVs are described in a little more
detail on p. 10 – I think this could be expanded on earlier to avoid the kinds of questions above
arising in the reader’s mind.
- Author comment: "The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of
Gothenburg University. This is added to the text: “The survey was conducted in accordance with
the ethical guidelines of the Gothenburg University in charge this project. Participants were not
compensated for their involvement.”"
13
- My response: Thanks for this amendment. I still miss information about whether participants
explicitly provided informed consent to take part in the research project.
- Author comment: "We have added two references that previously have used these measures;
see ref 24 and 30. Further, bird song perception is changed to “bid song experiences” and a
clarification of that it is the respondents view is made. Now it reads: “Participants were asked to
respond to three statements on a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 7
(completely agree), with a Cronbach alpha of 0.95: “Sounds from nature are important for my
experience of bird species in the area”; “Trees are important for my experience of bird species in
the area”; and “Plants are important for my experience of bird species in the area”."
- My response: But in the original submission you use “perception” in the item wording. Why has
this now changed? My comment is not requesting a change in the wording of the item – the item
has already been administered to participants - but a clarification of what “perception” actually
means for the reader of the paper. (See my comments above re estimations).
- Author comment: "Answer from authors: The format error is changed from “respondents´Thus,
areas...” to “respondents. Areas...”. As for the reviewers question regarding the “averaged
evaluation of the respondents in relation to naturalness” we have added Table 1 for an overview."
- My response: I appreciate the inclusion of Table 1 but it is still not clear from the text how the
classifications of high/low naturalness arose. “Areas classified here as being of high naturalness
... are perceived as having higher naturalness...” (p. 9, line 197). Perceived by whom? The
researchers or the participants? Did they rate the areas on a measure of naturalness (if so, what
are the scores/agreement) or was this made on the basis of some qualitative distinction?
- Author comment re post-hoc tests: "We agree with the reviewer and have added post-hoc
comparisons between the age groups."
- My response: Were these Bonferroni-corrected or similar?
- Author comment re. text now at p. 16, lines 329-330: "According to earlier comments concerning
that natural sounds were not related to calmness, natural sounds have been removed here.
Further, although not stating that it is significant differences, it reveals that human voices and
noise from the city is rated lower. We think this is an indicator of the reasoning we continue with
in the further text."
- My response: I still don’t think this is relevant because the study is examining effects of
naturalness, age and gender, not differences between natural and built sounds. If it is not
included in the results then it should not be introduced for the first time in the Discussion.
However if the authors wish to keep this point then it should be covered (with relevant means,
SDs, and statistical tests) in the Results section, and justified in the Introduction.
- Author comment re figures: We have added standard error to each of the bars in all figures.
- My response: Thanks for this - please edit captions to show that figures illustrate means and SE
values on the dependent variables.
Minor additional comments

Mercury in the video for Queen's "I Want To Break Free" - but I know it is taken from the paper

• p. 4, lines 88-90: “The aim of the present study is to examine how people rank their local
urban green spaces associated with natural sounds.” Where is the ranking occurring? I
recommend this sentence be deleted.

his paper the authors describe a quasi-experimental, survey-based study in which 1347 Swedish
dents of six urban locations provided ratings of: perceptions of the site in response to greenery-
ted sounds, perceptions of bird song, and the importance of nature sounds, trees, and plants for
ception of bird species. These ratings were analysed based on post-hoc groupings according to
uralness of the urban locations (high, low), gender (male, female), and age (young, middle-aged,
er). High naturalness, female gender, and age were significantly related to increased sound-based
ception of the site, importance of bird song, and important of nature sounds and greenery for
ceptions of bird species. The authors discuss these findings in the context of urban greenery
servation, the need for gender perspectives in planning and conservation processes, and age
erences in perceptions and use of and, access to, nature.
eral
paper adds to the growing, but still relatively undeveloped, field of acoustic experiences of natural
ironments as calming or otherwise psychologically beneficial. It encourages the reader to consider
se experiences in the context of individual differences, as well as environmental differences, and I
k this is a strength of the paper. The question of how different age groups experience nature as
eficial is under-examined but becoming ever more relevant in an ageing society. While this paper
resses important questions, I observe several limitations in the paper which I detail below. These
us largely on the theoretical rationale for the study, and the methodological choices taken with
ard to measures and analyses. As such I believe the paper requires major revisions.
oduction
, lines 62-65: In Ratcliffe et al. (2013) participants did not rank sounds themselves on the potential
stress-reduction. This analysis was carried out by the paper’s authors, who counted frequency of
ntion per sound type across all participant interviews, where sounds were mentioned in relation to
ss recovery and/or attention restoration. Bird sounds emerged as the type of sound most frequently
ntioned in this context (see Ratcliffe et al., 2013, p. 224). Please amend these sentences as
ropriate.
wer from authors: We have made changes in the text according to the accurate interpretation of
cliffe’s et al (2013) manuscript. Now it reads: “However, Ratcliffe et al. [22] counted frequency
mention per sound type across all participant interviews, where sounds were mentioned in
tion to stress recovery or attention restoration. Bird song emerged as the type of sound most
uently mentioned in this context followed by sounds of water, non-avian animals, elements
. soft wind and rain),...”
, lines 69 – 76: This section requires further rationale. Why is it important and/or interesting to
lyse differences in sound perceptions as a function of age and gender? What are the possible
lications of these kinds of analyses?
wer from authors: We agree with the reviewer and have added further rationales and references
h here and in the discussion. The text now reads: “Where there are positive experiences to
ural sounds in urban environments, it would be interesting to examine associations with
ographic variables such as age and gender. Several studies have reported on gender as well
age differences with regards to amount of activities, aesthetic ratings of natural environments
associated health and well-being [24, 25, 26,27, 28]. Ode et al. [24] reported that women
e more active in green spaces compared with men, gave a higher aestethic ratings and also
a higher well-being associated on a higher activity for people´s local green space. The same
dy also showed that older residents gave a greater aesthetic value and associated a higher
l-being to their local green space compared to younger people. The studies by Richardson
Mitchell [25], de Vries et al [26] and Astell-Burt et al. [27] showed differences in the
ociated health benefits with regards to gender as well as age, suggesting that the associated
lth benefit of closeness to urban green space varies between women and men and also during
lifespan of people. Explanations for these differences has been suggested to be associated
h variation in increased time spent in nearby nature of groups such as elderly and house
es [26]. However, there is a need for further studies into the characteristics of these
erences in relation to people´s experience in urban green space. One aspect that presently is
king, as far as we know, is how such demographic variables are linked to perceptual
mations of different natural sounds in urban green areas.”
, lines 77 – 78: The dependent variables are introduced here but I miss explanation of why these
cific variables are of interest. The variable “perception” is not tightly defined (further on expanded as
essments of greenery-related sounds” but this could mean many things), so I don’t really
erstand what the aims and hypotheses of the study are at this point.
wer from authors: We agree with the reviewers comment. The concept of perception is replaced
ughout the text with “estimations” or “experiences”. Further, “assessments of greenery-related
nds” is changed to “ratings of greenery related sound”.
thod
, line 101: Rename this section to “Participants”.
wer from authors: This section have been changed to “Participants” in accordance with the
ewers’ suggestion.
, lines 102-110: I miss information on informed consent procedures, and how the study was
ducted in accordance with relevant ethical guidelines.
swer from authors: The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of Gothenburg
versity. This is added to the text: “The survey was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines
he Gothenburg University in charge this project. Participants were not compensated for their
lvement.”
-8, lines 140-161: How were the dependent variable items developed and tested, and what was the
onale for using these items (linking back to my point about p. 4, lines 77-78)? At present there is little
text for these measures, particularly as they do not seem drawn from any previously used or
lished scales. I find the “perception of bird species” items particularly hard to interpret; perception
irds in what way? Positive or negative, or number of bird species present, etc.? Internal
sistencies of the three measures are high so I would also recommend testing structures via factor
lysis and, if appropriate, averaging them to produce a single score per measure (reducing the need
MANOVA).
wer from authors: We have added two references that previously have used these measures; see ref
nd 30. Further, bird song perception is changed to “bid song experiences” and a clarification of that
the respondents view is made. Now it reads: “Participants were asked to respond to three
ements on a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 7 (completely agree), with a
nbach alpha of 0.95: “Sounds from nature are important for my experience of bird species in the
a”; “Trees are important for my experience of bird species in the area”; and “Plants are important for
experience of bird species in the area”.
lly, we believe that using factor analysis in order to develop an index score for the three dependent
asures would be to go outside the scope of this paper. That would be more of a methodological
er. We use MANOVA not only because the dependent measures involve several scales, but to
stigate the details of each phenomenon (latent variable) representing the scales.
, lines 173-175: There appears to be some formatting error here (see line 175). But moreover I miss
rmation regarding the “averaged evaluations of the respondents” in relation to naturalness. Where
is reported and how were these evaluations made?
wer from authors: The format error is changed from “respondents´Thus, areas...” to “respondents.
as...”. As for the reviewers question regarding the “averaged evaluation of the respondents in
tion to naturalness” we have added Table 1 for an overview.
ults
, line 198: Please report all results, significant and non-significant.
wer from authors: We report only significant results because we had no one-sided (directional)
otheses; if so then zero-results would have been appropriate to report.
0, line 206: If I understand the results correctly then “sounds of nature”, unlikely rustling trees and
song, is not related to higher calmness but to enhanced perceptions of the site. Please clarify.
wer from authors: The reviewer is correct, “sounds of nature” have been removed from this
tence.
1-13, throughout: Since the age variable comprises three groupings, post-hoc comparisons are
uired. At present the findings show that scores on the DVs differ as a function of age, but it is not
r which age groups this relates to.
wer from authors: We agree with the reviewer and have added post-hoc comparisons between the
groups. Additional text is: “However, post-hoc tests showed that (1-5 statements): (1) no significant
erence between middle-aged and older was indicated (p = 0.44); (2) only significant difference was
wn between younger and older (p = 0.01); (3) no significant difference between middle-aged and
er was indicated (p = 0.42); (4) no significant difference between middle-aged and older was
cated (p = 0.08); (5) only significant difference was shown between younger and older (p = 0.01).”
ussion
4, line 290: In what way do the results show that visual and audible perception are connected? Can
unpack this sentence a bit? This occurs again on p. 15, lines 300-302 where combination of visual
auditory perceptions are again mentioned. I miss discussion earlier in the paper of how visual
ceptions are relevant; if this relates to perceived naturalness then it should be introduced earlier.
wer from authors: We here refer to that areas with different naturalness, such as low or high
uralness seemed to influence people’s perceptions of sounds. To make this clearer we have changed
sentence to “Our results also indicate that visual and audible experiences of urban greenery are
nected, in that areas with different naturalness had different rating of sounds, something that is
sing in most of the studies of visual perception of urban green spaces and visual urban green
nning.”
have also added a sentence in the results emphasizing these findings under figure 3 and figure 6.
us, the visual experience (high or low naturalness) was linked to the sound experience perceptions”.
ther, the lack of the interactions between visual and sound in the present literature is mentioned in
introduction line 51-58.
4, lines 296-297: Is this a significant difference, relevant to the aims of the study? I miss analyses
re scores on items regarding bird song and trees were compared to those regarding human voices
noise. Answer from authors: According to earlier comments concerning that natural sounds were
related to calmness, natural sounds have been removed here. Further, although not stating that it is
ificant differences, it reveals that human voices and noise from the city is rated lower. We think this
n indicator of the reasoning we continue with in the further text.
5, line 303: I think “enhanced” too strongly implies causality that cannot be supported by the study
ign. I would suggest rephrasing to “was related to”.
wer from authors: We agree and have changed the text according to the reviewer’s suggestion.
6, line 343-344: “… effects on gender…” Unless the survey had a very profound impact on
ticipants, I suspect there is a typo here! :) Please amend to, “Perceptions of natural sounds differ by
der in a similar way to visual perceptions of urban greenery…” or similar.
wer from authors: True indeed. The text is changed according to the reviewer, however with the
ht change in use of the term “perception” to “estimation”.
7, line 347-348: Where is this gender comparison of preference reported?
swer from authors: We agree with the reviewer. The sentence is somewhat misleading a reader. We
e changed it to “For women, sounds from nature, trees and plants were all more important for
erience bird species in urban greenery than for men.”
7, line 367: Is “well-being” the right terminology? This does not appear as one of the dependent
ables.
swer from authors: We agree with the reviewer that well-being is not the right terminology. We
oved “well-being” and the sentence is now changed to “Why women estimate stronger natural
nds remains partly unanswered.”
7, lines 367-375: I recommend that this section be reframed in order to be more explanatory of the
ings at hand, rather than descriptive. At present it relies heavily on the argument that women are
re emotionally labile, but this appears speculative in light of the data provided by the study (which is
about emotion per se).
swer from authors: We agree with the reviewer, this section have been removed and more proximal
lanations a suggested by the reviewer below have been added.
h regard to findings re age and gender, have the authors considered more proximal explanations?
example, increased time spent in nearby nature amongst the elderly and women who work in the

heir assertion on p. 18, line 379-380), and relative concerns about personal safety in nature amongst
men (cf. Hartig et al., 1998. http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02815739808730463; Richardson & Mitchell,
7, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.04.015) which might be a possible explanation for
the presence of voices was perceived as calming by female participants in this study). See also
ell-Burt et al., 2014 (doi:10.1136/jech-2013-203767) for a discussion on interactions between age
gender in regard to benefits of green space across the lifespan. Further consideration of the existing
ature on this topic would also help to strengthen the rationale for studying age and gender as put
ward in the Introduction.
wer from authors: We have added substantial text to the discussion with linkages to the above
gestions from the reviewer and in previous text as well (see p. 4, lines 69 – 76).
1, line 440: Is “well-being” an appropriate term here?
swer from authors: We agree with the reviewer that well-being is not the appropriate tem here. This
tence is changed to “Further studies should also deepen the knowledge of how to manage urban
enery for increased visual and sound experiences in relation to gender, age and thus also include
dren, who were not studied here.

ments to the Author(s)
paper presents an interesting and novel study on natural sound perception in urban greenery. The
hors demonstrate sound knowledge and awareness of the state-of-art in the field and some of the
ting research gaps. In general I find this work acceptable for publication, but the authors will need to
ke some revisions, especially in describing their study design and methodology, as well as showing
t they are aware of some of the weaknesses of their approach. Below I will present some comments
the different sections of the paper.
E:
tural sound perception' could evoke some confusion, as it could be interpreted in different ways
., some people have a 'natural' way of perceiving sounds). I would suggest to change this to
ception of natural sounds'.
swer from authors: We agree with the reviewer. Further, according to the reviewer’s criticism to the
m “perception” in below text about this term, it is changed in the title to “estimations”. The title now
ds: “Estimations of natural sounds in urban greenery: potential impact for urban nature preservation”
TRACT:
22: why not mention that the Swedish city is Gothenburg?
wer from authors: We agree with the reviewer. Gothenburg have been added.
final part of the abstract presents study findings. However, I would like to see some of the
minology' and phrasing used here which is used in the paper itself. For example, using the term
uralness' would make sense. The current text is very general and perhaps does not fully link up to
paper's aims and research questions.
wer from authors: We agree with the reviewer and have added “high naturalness” and “low
uralness” in the abstract.
25: "perception ratings". This relates to a more general criticism that I have concerning how the
m 'perception' is used rather loosely throughout the paper. What is really meant with 'perception' in
paper? See my later comments.
wer from authors: We agree to the reviewer’s comment which is in concordance with reviewer 1.
concept of perception is replaced throughout the text with “estimations” or “experiences”.
RODUCTION
51: "like sights". Perhaps change to "like natural sights"?
wer from authors: We agree with reviewer and have changed it accordingly to the suggestion.
53 etc: I think that you need to provide a bit more information about the specific results of this
dy, which is one of the few to date combining visual and sound aspects.
wer from authors: We agree and have added the sentence “However, this influence depended on
type of sound where e.g. bird song was lower rated in more urban visual settings.”
55, 57: two sentences in a row start with 'Thus'. Please edit.
wer from authors: We have changed according to the suggestions and removed one “thus”.
THOD
ain problem I have with the paper is that some assumptions are not really made explicit. For
mple, six groups of people were surveyed. All groups are linked to a specific green space and level of
uralness, as they live close to this area. However, did you control whether people were also using
se nearby green spaces? In some cases they might hardly be aware of them - and travel elsewhere
a preferred green experience. I would also like to see response rates broken down for the six
groups. Are there differences in the willingness to respond of the groups? Are low response rates for
e groups impacting the validity of the study?
wer from authors: All urban green areas are larger urban green settings that to some extent are not
y known and used by the local community but most probably are known to Gothenburg metropolitan
a as a whole e.g. Kungsparken. However, we agree that it is not clearly stated that the participants in
study are familiar with this green area in particular although the participants answered questions
cifically related to the green areas such as “how many time have you visited Guldheden last year”.
s, we have added this in text: “All respondents indicated that they were familiar with that specific
a by answering specific questions about the number of times they visited the area. “
have added Table 1 were it is possible to see response rates for broken down for the subgroups.
113 etc.: I would suggest to present the information here as a list, for readability reasons.
swer from authors: We only partly agree with the reviewer and are not sure that a table of the six
dy areas would make it more readable. We have added a link to another recent paper that provide
n more text and details about the green spaces “See Gunnarsson et al. [30] for further details of the
y site.”
145: what does the phrasing "...give me a stronger perception of the site" mean? See my earlier
ment about the use of 'perception'. How was this explained in Swedish? To me perception here
ld mean different things, varying from 'impression' to 'experience'. You need to make this more clear
void misunderstandings.
wer from authors: We agree with the reviewer, through the text we have reviewed and changed
rception” to “estimation” or “experience”. This was also mentioned by the first reviewer.
also line 159 etc.: "Trees are important to my perception of bird species in the area". Perception in
t sense??
wer from authors: We agree with the reviewer, through the text we have reviewed and changed
rception” to “estimation” or “experience”.
172 etc.: can you explain why you distinguished three age groups only? How did you select the
e categories?
wer from authors: We dichotomized naturalness and trichotomized age because there were too few
pondents in Gender by Naturalness by Age cell-combinations. We have included Table 1 that
trates this.
ULTS
205: once again, it is unclear what is meant with 'my perception of the area'.
swer from authors: We agree with the reviewer, throughout the text we have reviewed and changed
rception” to “estimation” or “experience”.
CUSSION
ne with some of my comments on the study design and method, you will probably need to provide a
re critical insight into study weaknesses and potential bias.
284: is it really true that "areas with perceived high naturalness were linked to more positive
ure-sound-related perception...", or is it rather so that people living near areas with perceived high
uralness demonstrated more positive nature-sound related perceptions?
swer from authors: A very good question indeed. We do however argue that the respondents
wering the questionnaire are answering the questions in relation to their experiences of visits in this
cific urban green area. The answer could however be linked to your suggestions although in that case
should have been more keen on comparing people’s perception living close to one are with
erienced high and low- naturalness. We have added a sentence to make this clearer “It should be
ed, however, that this difference partly could be influenced by the environment-related attitudes of
ple living nearby our study areas [30].”
343: the phrasing here is wrong, as natural sounds does not have an impact on gender (i.e. it cannot
nge gender!), but it is rather so that differences can be noted in nature sound perception between
genders.
wer from authors: True indeed. The text is changed according to the reviewer, however with the
ht change in use of the term “perception” to “estimation”. This mistake was also recognized by
ewer 1.
379 etc.: there could be some other generational aspects at play here, i.e. larger shares of the older
ulation having grown up in more natural settings, and thus having higher appreciation of nature.
er studies (e.g. Anna Adevi's PhD work at SLU) have touched upon the importance of upbringing in
re natural surroundings.
wer from authors: Good tip. We have added the work of Adevi and Grahn (2011) in one sentence
it could be that larger shares of the older population having grown up in more natural settings, and
s having higher appreciation of nature [50].”
URES
res 4, 5, 6, 7: you need to rephrase some of the caption texts, i.e. not "effect of gender/age on
nds, ..." but rather their effect on the perception of ... See e.g. Fig. 8: age does not have an impact on
song itself, but rather on the perception and appreciation of it.
swer from authors: We agree with the reviewer and have changed the figure texts.

ments to the Author(s)
r Authors,
nk you for the revised version of your manuscript, "Estimations of natural sounds in urban greenery -
ential impact for urban nature preservation", which I enjoyed reading. I think the manuscript has
roved. I still have some outstanding concerns from my previous review which I detail below. I think
se can be addressed by minor revisions to the text.
thors second comment:
r reviewer, we are very thankful for raising additional concerns and that you put extra time in the
sion of the manuscript. We hope that we answered your questions and that the manuscript is
roved.
thor comment: The concept of perception is replaced throughout the text with “estimations” or
periences”. Further, “assessments of greenery-related sounds” is changed to “ratings of greenery
ted sound”.
y response: I still struggle with this terminology. Estimation = a rough calculation of the amount or
ntity of greenery-related sounds? Or a judgment of the value of the greenery-related sounds? The
blem to me appears to be that the different items used in the scale cover so many “estimations” or
rceptions” that finding one term to accurately describe what they are all measuring is a challenge,
h the result that the term “estimation” says very little. What are the DVs measuring, exactly? Some of
m appear to relate to perceptions of calmness, some relate to stronger/weaker perceptions of the
as a whole, some relate to importance of hearing bird sounds, and some relate to the importance of
eriencing the presence of birds per se. In keeping with the use of MANOVA to measure different
nt variables, I think it would be much better to describe these different variables accurately and
vidually, rather than try to categorise them all together as “estimations”. I note that the DVs are
cribed in a little more detail on p. 10 – I think this could be expanded on earlier to avoid the kinds of
stions above arising in the reader’s mind.
thors second comment:
r Reviewer, you are quite right, the concept of “estimation” is not appropriate in this context. We
e replaced “estimations” with “evaluations” throughout the text. We have furthermore added that
ticipants were asked to evaluate (rate its desirability) different type of sounds (see section 2.4.1.) and
song (see section 2.4.2.). Concerning section 2.4.3., we have added the following sentence:
cordingly, in this task the participants were asked to value the importance of these three variables
the experience of bird song.”
en the above, and your comment about the post-hoc tests, we have rewritten section 2.5.3.
tistical analyses) as follows: “Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used because all three
asures (dependent variables) contained more than one scale/dimension, measuring the latent
ables of “greenery-related sound” desirability, ”bird song” desirability, and valuation of the
ortance of “trees and plants for the experience of bird species”. Furthermore, we used used Fisher's
t significant difference (LSD) as post-hoc test. The independent variables of Naturalness, Gender and
were treated as between-subject factors.”
have also in the Result section added that we used Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) as post-
test.
thor comment: "The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of Gothenburg
versity. This is added to the text: “The survey was conducted in accordance with the ethical
elines of the Gothenburg University in charge this project. Participants were not compensated for
r involvement.”"
y response: Thanks for this amendment. I still miss information about whether participants explicitly
vided informed consent to take part in the research project.
hors second comment:

thor comment: "We have added two references that previously have used these measures; see ref
nd 30. Further, bird song perception is changed to “bird song experiences” and a clarification of that
the respondents view is made. Now it reads: “Participants were asked to respond to three
ements on a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 7 (completely agree), with a
nbach alpha of 0.95: “Sounds from nature are important for my experience of bird species in the
a”; “Trees are important for my experience of bird species in the area”; and “Plants are important for
experience of bird species in the area”."
y response: But in the original submission you use “perception” in the item wording. Why has this
changed? My comment is not requesting a change in the wording of the item – the item has
ady been administered to participants - but a clarification of what “perception” actually means for
reader of the paper. (See my comments above re estimations).
hors second comment:
have tried to answer this in the above text linking to the re estimations. The use of perception in
cific was questioned by the second reviewer and thus changed.
thor comment: "Answer from authors: The format error is changed from “respondents´Thus,
as...” to “respondents. Areas...”. As for the reviewers question regarding the “averaged evaluation of
respondents in relation to naturalness” we have added Table 1 for an overview."
y response: I appreciate the inclusion of Table 1 but it is still not clear from the text how the
sifications of high/low naturalness arose. “Areas classified here as being of high naturalness ... are
ceived as having higher naturalness...” (p. 9, line 197). Perceived by whom? The researchers or the
ticipants? Did they rate the areas on a measure of naturalness (if so, what are the scores/agreement)
as this made on the basis of some qualitative distinction?
hors second comment:
y good comment, we have now added: This means that the green spaces were redefined from six to
‘perceived naturalness’ categories of high versus low, based on the mean value of the different
ceptual categories evaluated by the respondents.
thor comment re post-hoc tests: "We agree with the reviewer and have added post-hoc
parisons between the age groups."
y response: Were these Bonferroni-corrected or similar?
hors second comment:
have used Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) as post-hoc test. This is a most commonly used
t-hoc test in an analysis of variance, and it is a default post-hoc test in the statistical software of SPSS
n calculating analysis of variance. This is added in the results and also mentioned in comments
ve.
thor comment re. text now at p. 16, lines 329-330: "According to earlier comments concerning that
ural sounds were not related to calmness, natural sounds have been removed here. Further,
ough not stating that it is significant differences, it reveals that human voices and noise from the city
ted lower. We think this is an indicator of the reasoning we continue with in the further text."
y response: I still don’t think this is relevant because the study is examining effects of naturalness,
and gender, not differences between natural and built sounds. If it is not included in the results then
ould not be introduced for the first time in the Discussion. However if the authors wish to keep this
nt then it should be covered (with relevant means, SDs, and statistical tests) in the Results section,
justified in the Introduction.
hors second comment:
are right, we performed t-test of all types of combinations and they were all significant different
re were differences between “natural sounds” as well as between “natural and non-natural sounds”.
wever visually figure 5 illustrates that the differences are larger between natural and built sounds
n between natural sounds per se and built sounds per se. Nevertheless, we thus removed this part
m the discussions. Good point.
thor comment re figures: We have added standard error to each of the bars in all figures.
y response: Thanks for this - please edit captions to show that figures illustrate means and SE values
he dependent variables.
hors second comment:
d, we have added “The columns illustrate mean values and ±SE of dependent variables” under each
re.
or additional comments
p. 4, line 8: Correct spelling to “housewives” (funny term, it makes me think of Freddie Mercury
he video for Queen's "I Want To Break Free" - but I know it is taken from the paper cited in-text... :)
hors second comment:
the spelling is changed and some of us also watched the music video of Queens for the first time <U+F04A>
p. 4, lines 88-90: “The aim of the present study is to examine how people rank their local urban
en spaces associated with natural sounds.” Where is the ranking occurring? I recommend this
tence be deleted.
hors second comment:
we removed “rank” and added “evaluate” instead.
hor’s additional comment to the manuscript:
found a misspelling in the method section where “approximate” and approximately” were
ntioned next to each other, this is corrected in this new version.
changed the number of interviews in the abstract where 1347 answered the questionnaire but
ually 1326 were used in this study, thus it is changed in the abstract from 1347 to 1326 since we find
number being more correct.
also added that we used the software 22 SPSS in under the heading statistical analyses.
lly, we added that we are very thankful for the comments we received by the two reviewers in the
nowledgement.
Dear editor,
We are very glad that the paper now is scientifically accepted but are very remorseful that the ethics
procedure was not fully convenient. Most of our previous comments were directly stated to the editor
but rather few changes were made in the manuscript, we can now see that this was a huge mistake
from our side. We have now included a new paragraph about the ethics code of our study. We write (see
Method section 2.2 Participants): "The survey was conducted in accordance with APA’s (American
Psychological Association) ethics code. That is, the participants were fully informed about: (1) the aim of
our research, its procedures, benefits to society and especially to people living in a city nearby urban
greenery, as well as the length of participation; (2) their right to withdraw from the study at any time
without any consequences; (3) reasonably factors that may influence their willingness to participate, for
example, how long it will take to complete the questionnaire and information about the types of
questions included in the questionnaire; (4) confidentiality; (5); that they will not be financially
