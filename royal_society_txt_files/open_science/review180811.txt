The purpose of this manuscript was to develop and test a novel supercritical carbon dioxide
foamed poly-l-lactide-co-e-caprolactone scaffold for vaginal reconstruction.
Comments:
In the section 2.3, the authors should explain why they were using collagenase and dispase (what
for?)?
Is there any contamination of the epithelial cell culture with fibroblasts and vice versa?
Page 6, lines 37 to 41: should we understand that you seeded 80000 EC or SCs per scaffold?
Also, should we understand that you seed such high cell density in 20 ul of medium for 2.5 h.
What was the cell viability after such a low level of nutriment and longtime of culture?
Page 6, line 44,45: the authors should indicate the time after which the analyses were performed.
The same remark with page 6, lines 53,54
Page 7, lines 1-10: did the authors maintained the cells in 500 ul of medium for, 1, 7 or 14 days? Is
there medium changing/the time of medium changing if any?
What is the composition of the EpiLife medium?
Did you supplement this medium with serum and growth factors, as epithelial cells need several
growth factors such as: EGF, insulin, hydrocortisone, etc.
What was the medium used for fibroblasts?
The control (the tissue culture plate) data is missing. This is the real control for at least the data
presented in fig.5. Indeed, it is questionable that after seeding 80 000 cells per scaffold, the
relative number of cell collected after 14 days was only 8000.

This is an interesting paper dealing with mechanical properties and cell studies on a
thermoplastic elastomer PLCL 70:30.
The paper is well organized with a ghood introduction on the polymeric biomaterials available
today for tissue engineering studies. In this particular case a poly (lactide-co- -caprolactone) of
molar content LA 70/CL 30 is presented as a biocompatible material for vaginal tissue
engineering. Cell studies
Vaginal epithelial (EC) and stromal cells (SC) were isolated, expanded, and characterized Cells
were cultured with foamed scPLCL (foamed with supercritical CO2) scaffolds in separate and/or
co-cultures. Their attachment, viability, proliferation and phenotype were analyzed.
The results are sound and the discussion well developed illustrating the good biocompatibility of
scPLCL for vaginal tissue engineering.
I recommend the publication after the minor changes suggested below.
1) PLCL with 70 % LA is known to be prone to crystallize depending on the size of the lactide
blocks in copolymer chains. The chain microstructure results and analysis by NMR would be
highly desirable following to Fernandez et al. (JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR
OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS 9 (2012) 100-112, JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL
BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS 12 (2012) 29-38).
Differential scanning calorimetry would be also of help to know if the majoritary component LA
crystallizes or not, being know the reluctant crystal residues to biodegrade in comparison with
the amorphous regions.
2) In the introduction part it lacks a more precise description of PLCL mechanical properties and
their comparison with vaginal tissue that pretends to be replaced by this biocompatible and
biodegradable thermoplastic elastomer.

As shown in SEM in Fig. 3, most of the pores in the scPLCL scaffold are closed, can the cells
infiltrate into the scaffold?
Fig.4, LIVE/DEAD images of epithelial and stromal cells in separate cultures and co-cultures at
the assessment period were obtained on the surfaces of scaffolds, how many cells were
alive/dead in the middle of scaffolds? If the author showed the images in a lower amplification,
and showed the middle images of cells in the scPLCL, it would be reliable to judge the cells
migrated into the scaffolds, and whether alive or dead. So, unsufficient data are not available to

Appendix A
Detailed Response to Reviewers
22.05.2018
Dear Editor,
We have now paid due attention to the constructive comments of both referees and
have amended the manuscript as follows.
Herewith our responses to the helpful comments of Reviewer 1:
1. In the section 2.3, the authors should explain why they were using
collagenase and dispase (what for?)?
Thank you for pointing out this issue. The original reference was
missing from the Cell Isolation paragraph 2.3. We added some details
to the paragraph 2.3. according to reviewers suggestion. The isolation
protocol was modified from the De Filippo et al. They used both
collagenase and dispase in the cell isolation [1]. This information has
now been added to the manuscript. The dispase is more specific for
releasing epithelial cells from the stroma [2]. The collagenase I was
used to digest the collagenous extracellular matrix and it is also
recommend to digest epithelial tissue according to the manufacturer
(Life Technologies) [3].
2. Is there any contamination of the epithelial cell culture with fibroblasts and
vice versa?
Thank you for the valuable comment. Based on the light microscope
visualization, there was some contamination between the different cell
types right after isolation. However, the contamination decreased
during cell culturing and passaging since, the epithelial cells favour the
epilife medium and the fibroblasts favour the medium containing
human serum. There is an example figure on vaginal epithelial and
stromal cell lines cultured on T75 cell culture flasks. We can also add
this figure to the manuscript if reviewers consider it as a helpful
addition.
Figure: A. Epithelial cells cultured on Epilife medium B. Stromal cells
cultured on DMEM/F12 with 5 % human serum.
3. Page 6, lines 37 to 41: should we understand that you seeded 80000 EC or
SCs per scaffold?
Also, should we understand that you seed such high cell density in 20 ul of
medium for 2.5 h. What was the cell viability after such a low level of
nutriment and longtime of culture?
Yes, that is correct. In separate cultures we seeded 40 000 EC:s or SCs
on the both sides of the scaffolds. And in co-cultures we seeded 40 000
ECs on the other side of the scaffold and 40 000 SCs on the other side.
We seeded the cells in a small amount of medium in order to get the
cells on the scaffold. If the amount of the medium is high during the
cell seeding, the cells quite easily fall into the bottom of the cell culture
well instead of the scaffold. The scaffolds were preincubated in
medium for 24 h before cell implantation so the scaffolds are wet
which prevents the cells from drying. Additionally, according the
live/dead imaging the cells were viable after 1 d, which also confirms
that the cells survive from the 2,5 h adhesion period. Thank you for
you valuable points, we clarified these in the manuscript at paragraphs
2.5 and 3.4. in order to further improve our manuscript.
4. Page 6, line 44,45: the authors should indicate the time after which the
analyses were performed. The same remark with page 6, lines 53,54.
Thank you for the comment, we changed the paragraph 2.5 according
to the reviewers suggestion.
5. Page 7, lines 1-10: did the authors maintained the cells in 500 ul of medium
for, 1, 7 or 14 days? Is there medium changing/the time of medium changing
if any?
Thank you for the helpful comment. The medium was changed 3 times
per week and this information is now added to the manuscript in
paragraph 2.5.
6. What is the composition of the EpiLife medium?
Did you supplement this medium with serum and growth factors, as
epithelial cells need several growth factors such as: EGF, insulin,
hydrocortisone, etc.
What was the medium used for fibroblasts?
EpiLife (Invitrogen) medium contains 1% of EpiLife Defined Growth
Supplement (EDGS; Invitrogen), 0.1% of CaCl2 (Invitrogen), and
0.35% of antibiotics (100U/mL penicillin and 0.1mg/mL streptomycin
(Lonza, BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium). The EDGS is a commercial
supplement for EpiLife medium containing purified bovine serum
albumin, purified bovine transferrin, hydrocortisone, recombinant
human insulin-like growth factor type-1 (rhIGF-1), prostaglandin E2
(PGE2) , recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF).
The fibroblast medium contains DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5 %
Human Serum (Biowest), 1 % GlutaMAX (Life Technologies) and 1
% of antibiotics (100U/mL penicillin and 0.1mg/mL streptomycin;
Lonza, BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium).
The medium compositions are now described in the manuscript in the
paragraph 2.3.
7. The control (the tissue culture plate) data is missing. This is the real control
for at least the data presented in fig.5. Indeed, it is questionable that after
seeding 80 000 cells per scaffold, the relative number of cell collected after
14 days was only 8000.
Thank you for the valuable comment. Indeed, we did not use the tissue
culture plate as a control in this manuscript. However, this is because it
is really hard to reliably compare the 2D cell culture plate to 3D
scaffold since the cell culture surface area is considerably different in
2D cell culture plate compared to 3D scaffold. Additionally, if we
would have seeded 80 000 cells to the cell culture plastic, it would
have been too full in no time and cells would have suffered from it.
However, in the future studies we are trying to pay attention to
selecting an appropriate control.
The CyQuant assay kit (Invitrogen) is based on measuring the
fluorescence of each sample and it represents the amount of DNA in
the sample. Therefore, it does not measure the absolute number of the
cells and we cannot conclude the absolute cell amount based on this
method.
Herewith our responses to the helpful comments of Reviewer 2:
1. PLCL with 70 % LA is known to be prone to crystallize depending on the
size of the lactide blocks in copolymer chains. The chain microstructure
results and analysis by NMR would be highly desirable following to
Fernandez et al. (JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF
BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS 9 (2012) 100-112, JOURNAL OF THE
MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS 12 (2012)
29-38). Differential scanning calorimetry would be also of help to know if
the majoritary component LA crystallizes or not, being know the reluctant
crystal residues to biodegrade in comparison with the amorphous regions.
Thank you for the valuable comment, we agree that the crystallization
behaviour is a very important aspect to be considered when designing
bioresorbable structures. We have added 0 week and 4-week DSC-
results on the text to give more clarity to this matter. Addition is
paragraphs 2.2 and 3.1. Previously, the same copolymer (PLC 7015,
Corbion Purac) used in this study, is extensively studied by Ahola et
al. [4]. The results presented here, regarding the crystallization
behaviour, follow in the short term as well as in long term the same
trend presented by Ahola et al. [4].
2. In the introduction part it lacks a more precise description of PLCL
mechanical properties and their comparison with vaginal tissue that pretends
to be replaced by this biocompatible and biodegradable thermoplastic
elastomer.
The authors want to thank reviewer from the helpful comment. We
have compared the mechanical properties of PLCL to vaginal tissue in
discussion part but we added more precise description to the
introduction part also. The changes are highlighted in red colour.
Herewith our responses to the helpful comments of Reviewer 3:
1. As shown in SEM in Fig. 3, most of the pores in the scPLCL scaffold are
closed, can the cells infiltrate into the scaffold?
Thank you for the reconstructive comment. We analyzed the
interconnectivity of the pores in PLCL scaffolds and added the method
and results in to the manuscript in paragraph 2.2 and 3.1. The analysis
shows that the pores are 98 % interconnected to the 100 <U+F06D>m diameter
ball. However, we are all the time focusing on optimizing the scaffold
manufacturing methods in order to control the scaffold porosity and
pore interconnectivity more exactly. Additionally, we are optimizing
our cell implantation methods in order to get the stromal cells inside
the scaffold more reliably.
2. Fig.4, LIVE/DEAD images of epithelial and stromal cells in separate cultures
and co-cultures at the assessment period were obtained on the surfaces of
scaffolds, how many cells were alive/dead in the middle of scaffolds? If the
author showed the images in a lower amplification, and showed the middle
images of cells in the scPLCL, it would be reliable to judge the cells
migrated into the scaffolds, and whether alive or dead. So, unsufficient data
are not available to make a decision.
Thank you for the reasonable criticism and valuable suggestions for
future research. Indeed, we do not have reliable knowledge on how
cells migrate on the middle of the scaffold. In order to study the cell
viability in the middle of the scaffold, we would have to cut the
scaffold, which would harm the cells. Therefore, with these imaging
methods it is not possible to get reliable information on how cells grow
inside the scaffold. In the future, we are focusing on developing better
methods to reliably study the cell growth in the middle of the scaffold.
We are also planning to do in vivo studies in the future in order to
study for instance the tissue growth inside the scaffold.
