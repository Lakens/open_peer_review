This paper is very clearly presented and written in admirably clear English. It examines fiddler
crabs which have been frightened and so run back to their burrow guided by path integration.
The Results show that crabs may get distracted from their path integration computed home
trajectory by a fake entrance presented nearby. The probability of attraction to the fake entrance
drops with the distance of the fake entrance from the real one. Data and analysis demonstrate
attraction to the fake entrance by showing that the directional error toward the fake entrance is
relatively large at the start of the analysed trajectory and small by the end, while the error to the
real entrance increases from small to large. When there is no attraction, the error to the real
entrance remains small over the whole journey.
Where the paper falls down a bit is in discussing and analysing what might be happening. The
assumption (lines 320-322) is made that path integration is suppressed by sight of the visual
entrance. Recent discussions of similar questions in insect navigation (e.g. Collett, M. (2012). How
navigational guidance systems are combined in a desert ant. Current Biology, 22(10), 927-932.;
Wehner, R., Hoinville, T., Cruse, H., & Cheng, K. (2016). Steering intermediate courses: desert
ants combine information from various navigational routines. Journal of Comparative Physiology
A, 202(7), 459-472.) emphasise that guidance systems tend to combine to control direction in a
weighted manner. It would be good to test whether that kind of interaction might explain your
data as well. Directional certainty in path integration is strongest when the animal is far from its
goal and becomes less as distances shorten. Thus, one might expect that the weighting of the
compromise will change during the approach and the crab will gradually turn towards the fake
entrance (cf. Bregy, P., Sommer, S., Wehner, R., 2008. Nest-mark orientation versus vector
navigation in desert ants. J. Exp. Biol. 211, 1868–1873).
For that you will need to consider the path over longer distances than shown in your Fig. 3. After
noticing how short the distances are in that fig., I re-read the Methods to see how large an area
you were recording over and found that you give no details of your recording set up. What area
does the camera survey (cm by cm)? What is resolution of the camera (pixels by pixels) and its
frame rate? Please do supply these details.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This manuscript addresses an interesting question, but fails to present an adequate analysis.
It is of great interest to understand how animals integrate different sources of information in
order to guide behaviour. In this particular case, fiddler crabs were confronted with an
experimentally induced conflict between their burrow location as defined by the home vector
computed through path integration and the location of a visible, but fake, burrow entrance.
Whether or not they are attracted away from the end of their home vector and toward the fake
burrow depends on the spatial relationship between the fake and the real burrow position and
most importantly the direction from which the crabs approach the two.
Major concerns:
(1) As far as I can see, your analysis does not capture a crucially important aspect of the
interaction between path integration and visual goal recognition, namely the distance at which
crabs can see a fake burrow, or to say it differently the point along the path at which they change
direction in relation to the fake burrow and the end of their home vector. Moreover, the spatial
relationships between fake and true burrow positions and the direction of approach are not
adequately (or at least in a way that is not easily understandable) accounted for in the present
analysis.
(2) To capture this, a proper path analysis should be conducted (the time course of running
direction relative to the angular position of targets (or target direction); time course of running
direction/speed and distance to targets ect).
(3) Because the crabs’ movements are rather fast, this should be done at full frame rate
(50fps?) and not with a down-sampled frame rate of currently 10fps. For instance: in the most
interesting and informative Fig. 3 (which, however, is not being referred to in the text), the
example paths for ‘F-events’ are curved, meaning that the crabs steer towards the visible burrow
entrance, but the temporal sampling is too coarse to allow the identification of the points along
the paths where the crabs first change their running direction.
(4) You should emphasize more clearly that this is an example of a very fast and multi-
modal ‘decision-making’ process, which is of great interest, especially when considering its
neural implementation.
Detailed comments & suggestions
Line 63: ‘…or visiting females…’. Not all fiddler crab males do this. It depends on the mating
system, so better: ‘…as a hub for foraging or attracting or visiting females…’
Line 65: References 13, 24 and 25 actually show that very active males use a self-constructed
‘landmark’ to help them relocating their burrows…
Line 75: Add ref 9 to ref 15 here to back up the statement that crabs compensate for passive
rotation.
Line 75ff: better: ‘…do not compensate for passive translation’.
Line 76ff: better: ‘…when a foraging crab is shifted, for instance, on a sliding sheet of sand paper,
it subsequently returns to its burrow by following a straight path…’
Line79ff: ‘…suggest that visual recognition of landmarks or the burrow itself is only activated
towards the end of the home vector.’ Comment: there are actually a number of studies in insect
navigation that have shown that (1) desert ants only respond to the CO2 plume of nests towards
the end of their home vector (Buehlmann, C., Hansson, B. S., & Knaden, M. (2012). Path
integration controls nest plume following in desert ants. Current Biology, 22(7), 645-649) and (2)
4
also to landmarks (P. Bregy, S. Sommer, R. Wehner Nest-mark orientation versus vector
navigation in desert ants J. Exp. Biol., 211 (2008), pp. 1868–1873).
Line 84: ‘idiothetic’ means ‘without external reference cues’ and is a very special case. PI
accumulates errors simply because it requires integration of noisy sensory signals, such as
compass direction or odometry.
Line 93: better ‘…may use the burrow entrance…’
Line 132: Give resolution of camera or video in pixels, approximate recording area in cm and
frame rate in frames per second.
Line 166: Your tracking interval suggests that you filmed at 50 fps and digitized crab positions
every 5th frame?
Line 178: Translocation distance is not the only variable that is important in this context, but also
the direction of the home vector relative to the line connecting the fake and the true burrow. It
would be much more adequate to first find a better description of the geometry of the situation
and secondly a statistic that helps to identify the ‘decision points’ along the crabs’ paths.
Line 193: I am confused about your definition of ‘initial error’ and would prefer it to be defined in
terms of ‘error angle’ rather than projected final minimal distance to target: From Fig. 1b I
understand that you use the initial path direction at the start of the response (not it’s velocity as
such) which you then ‘scale with the model’. I assume you mean that you then project that
direction towards the goals as shown in Fig. 1b and then define ‘initial errors’ as the smallest
possible distance to target (your dotted lines in Fig. 1b).
Line 221: better: ‘if it was visible. We found that … entrances were visible …’
Line 247ff: See my comments above: The crabs’ decisions also depend on the foraging direction
relative to the line connecting fake and real burrow.
Line 269ff: This is the interesting finding, but your makes a few important aspects difficult to
judge: Your Fig. 5f seems to suggest that the ‘F-model’ error decreases right from the start of the
response at a mean distance of 3 cm, which is well within the visual contact distance of fiddler
crabs to their burrow, which is about 5 times the eye height above ground (see Fig. 6, Zeil J,

Natural History of Crustaceans (ten-volume series, editor-in-chief, M. Thiel). Oxford Univ. Press,
New York, pp 484-508.). For U. perplexa, which have carapace widths/eye heights between 0.8
and 1.7 cm, this would translate into a detection distance range between 4 and 8.5 cm!
Line 290ff: The formation of a home vector without visual contact with a goal is the ‘trick’ of path
integration. So I am not sure why you find this ‘remarkable’.

Comments to the Author:
I have now received two reviews of your manuscript. Both reviewers agree that the question
being asked is interesting and design of the study is appropriate. However, both reviewers feel
that the analysis does not directly answer the question being asked. This is because the two
processes, path integration and visual recognition, are not mutually exclusive with an immediate
shift from one to the other, as the analysis suggests here, but the weight given to each should
change along the home run as the crabs update their PI information with information from visual
cues. I find myself in agreement with both of the reviewers, who have each offered constructive
suggestions and useful references to help improve the analysis.
In addition to this major statistical limitation of the study, on reading the manuscript I found
myself wishing for more details about the study design to enable the study to be replicated. For
example, how were crabs chosen to be subjects? Over what area was the sample of tested
individuals spread? How were study subjects chosen? How long did the video apparatus take to
set up whilst the crab was, presumably, in its burrow? At what time of the tide were the
experiments conducted? How were the crabs scared by the observer during the experiment? Did
moving the cork board to displace the fake burrow entrance disturb the crabs? How thick was the
cork sheet? And the plastic sheet that it was attached to? (As some crabs tripped over it, it would
be good to provide its height.)

Whether or not they are attracted away from the end of their home vector and toward the fake

Thanks for considering my comments and please follow up with a more detailed analysis of fine-

L65: Please check references here: 21&22 are studies of ‘pure’ PI and 23 does not treat PI in crabs,
but mammals. The exceptions to the ‘exclusive use of PI’ are references 29 and 30.
L78: it may be better to replace ‘seat’ by ‘sheet’.

altogether by asking whether the crabs correct for the mismatch between their true burrow

movement of the crab…?
L260: ‘…did not differ significantly between…’
L308ff: The logic of this sentence continues to be obscure due to ‘Although’ at the beginning and
‘even’ at the end. Why don’t you simply state that fiddler crabs use path integration to locate
their burrows from distances at which they cannot see the burrow.
L336: ‘…of the platform..’
L338: ‘…starting point is within the visual contact distance…’
L360ff: I am not convinced by this discussion which you added because of Referee 1’s comments.
I think that your data show no evidence of a weighted solution to the conflict between PI and the
fake burrow. The crabs would then end up at a location half-way between the true and the fake
burrow, which they clearly don’t. So maybe you could simplify this discussion by saying
something like this:
‘At this stage, it remains to be seen whether the crabs solve conflicts between information
provided by path integration and the visual appearance of the burrow in a weighted manner, as
it has been suggested for ants [refs], or whether they switch to visual guidance whenever the
burrow entrance becomes visible.’

Thanks for considering my comments and please follow up with a more detailed analysis of fine-

L65: Please check references here: 21&22 are studies of ‘pure’ PI and 23 does not treat PI in crabs,
but mammals. The exceptions to the ‘exclusive use of PI’ are references 29 and 30.
L78: it may be better to replace ‘seat’ by ‘sheet’.
L116ff: There is no need for the confusing term ‘pseudo homing error’. I suggest removing it
altogether by asking whether the crabs correct for the mismatch between their true burrow
location and the fake burrow entrance ect.

their burrows from distances at which they cannot see the burrow.

L360ff: I am not convinced by this discussion which you added because of Referee 1’s comments.
I think that your data show no evidence of a weighted solution to the conflict between PI and the
fake burrow. The crabs would then end up at a location half-way between the true and the fake
burrow, which they clearly don’t. So maybe you could simplify this discussion by saying
something like this:
‘At this stage, it remains to be seen whether the crabs solve conflicts between information
provided by path integration and the visual appearance of the burrow in a weighted manner, as
it has been suggested for ants [refs], or whether they switch to visual guidance whenever the
burrow entrance becomes visible.’

Appendix A
GENERAL COMMENTS
We first note that while the time interval was set at 0.1 sec (3 frames) for analysis in the
previous manuscript, we re-digitized at the full frame rate (30 fps) in the revised
manuscript in accordance with the comment of the reviewer #2. Accordingly, we
re-defined the starting and stopped points of escape run, revising the following text
from (Line 176);
“We considered the starting point of an escape run as a crab’s position at the time when
the velocity first became >100 mm s-1 after being frightened and the stopping point as
the time when the velocity first dropped to below 100 mm s-1 after the starting point.”
to
“We considered the starting point of an escape run as a crab’s position at a frame after
being frightened and when it moved at least 3.33 mm in the 33.3 ms time interval
preceding this frame and at least 10.0 mm over a three-frame interval (100 ms) starting
at the previous frame, and the stopping point as a frame after the starting point and
when the crab moved at most 3.33 mm in the 33.3 ms time interval preceding this frame
and at most 10.0 mm over a three-frame interval starting at the previous frame.”
Then, we found that while during escape runs crabs in 3 out of 40 trials were previously
judged to be caught by the edge of the sheet (i.e., the stopping points were located here),
additional two crabs were judged (5 out of 40 in total), thereby observed 14 T events
and 21 F events. Moreover, while previously there were no significant difference in
running speeds during escape runs between the two events, we found that running speed
in the F event is slightly but significantly larger than that in T event. Accordingly, we
have revised the following text from (Line 254);
“It should be noted that crabs in both events ran without stopping until they arrived at
either entrance, with no significant difference in running speeds during escape runs
between the two events (Wilcoxon signed-rank test: W= 6510.5, P = 0.6023, n = 226;
Figure 2).”
“It should be noted that while crabs in both events ran without stopping until they
arrived at either entrance, there is significant but slight difference in running speeds
during escape runs between the two events (Wilcoxon signed-rank test: W = 47945, P =
0.004379, n = 593; Figure 2a) that is unexplained but may relate to whether crabs ran,
finally having visual contact with the entrance during the runs.”
However, except for these, we found that our analysis captures basically same homing
behaviour of the crabs with that in the previous manuscript, i.e., as we noted in the
Abstract “frightened fiddler crabs initially ran towards the true burrow following PI,
then altered their behaviour depending on the distance between the fake entrance and
masked true burrow; if the distance was large, they kept running until they reached the
true burrow, ignoring the visual cue; however, if the distance was small, they altered the
homing path and ran until they reached the fake entrance”. We therefore consider that
main results in this paper remain after this alternation.
Moreover, due to this alternation, while we showed the trajectories by vectors in figure
3 in the previous manuscript, we have revised to show them by lines as in most previous
studies, to make them easier to see.
RESPONSES TO THE EDITOR:
We wish to express our appreciation to the Editor for insightful comments, which have
helped us significantly improve the paper.
COMMENT 1: I have now received two reviews of your manuscript. Both reviewers
agree that the question being asked is interesting and design of the study is appropriate.
However, both reviewers feel that the analysis does not directly answer the question
being asked. This is because the two processes, path integration and visual recognition,
are not mutually exclusive with an immediate shift from one to the other, as the analysis
suggests here, but the weight given to each should change along the home run as the
crabs update their PI information with information from visual cues. I find myself in
agreement with both of the reviewers, who have each offered constructive suggestions
and useful references to help improve the analysis.
RESPONSE: We wish to thank the editor for this general comment. For the points
raised by the reviewers, please see our point-by-point responses to reviewers’
comments as follows.
COMMENT 2: In addition to this major statistical limitation of the study, on reading
the manuscript I found myself wishing for more details about the study design to enable
the study to be replicated. For example, how were crabs chosen to be subjects? Over
what area was the sample of tested individuals spread? How were study subjects
chosen? How long did the video apparatus take to set up whilst the crab was,
presumably, in its burrow? At what time of the tide were the experiments conducted?
How were the crabs scared by the observer during the experiment? Did moving the cork
board to displace the fake burrow entrance disturb the crabs? How thick was the cork
sheet? And the plastic sheet that it was attached to? (As some crabs tripped over it, it
would be good to provide its height.)
RESPONSE: We appreciate the editor's comment on this point. For more detailed
description of the study design, we have revised the following texts in accordance
with the editor’s comment, from (Line 130):
“Field experiments were conducted using male fiddler crabs Uca perplexa (H. Milne
Edwards, 1852) inhabiting the intertidal flat in Funaura Bay on Iriomote Island,
Okinawa Prefecture, Japan (123°48'E; 24°24'N) during August 2016. All
experiments were recorded from above using a Panasonic HDC-TM700 camcorder.”
to
“Field experiments were conducted in a large colony (about 15 × 20 m) of Uca
perplexa (H. Milne Edwards, 1852) at Funaura Bay on Iriomote Island, Okinawa
Prefecture, Japan (123°48'E; 24°24'N) at daytime during the 1.5 h before and after
ebb tide during August 2016. We used male U. perplexa that shows typical homing
behaviour using PI. All experiments were recorded from above using a video
apparatus with a Panasonic HDC-TM700 camcorder (1920 × 1080 pixels, 30
frames/s) fitted a with Panasonic VW-W4907H-K wide conversion lens (0.75 ×),
whose field of view is 3 × 1.7 m. Immediately after the apparatus was set, each
experiment was conducted with a randomly chosen individual in the field of view."
And from (Line 141):
“A fake entrance was constructed by cutting a 1.5-cm-diameter hole in the centre of a
10 × 10 cm cork sheet, to which a plastic sheet of the same size was attached for
reinforcement.”

reinforcement (2 mm thickness in total).”
And from (Line 149):
“Two corners of the sheet were attached to fishing line, allowing an experimenter,
who was 1.5 m away, to translocate the sheet towards him. After the crab had
emerged from its burrow, left the fake entrance and the sheet and moved away to
feed, the sheet was slowly translocated to allow either the fake entrance to be shown
and the true entrance to be masked by the sheet; or the true entrance to be shown by
translocating the sheet a greater distance.”

and the true entrance to be masked by the sheet; or the true entrance to be shown by

performed slowly so as not to disturb the crab. Then the crab was frightened by the
experimenter getting up from the chair.”

“Time series of the crabs’ positions in all trials of the main experiments using the

RESPONSES TO THE REVIER 1:
We wish to express our appreciation to the reviewer for his or her insightful comments,
which have helped us significantly improve the paper.
COMMENT 1: This paper is very clearly presented and written in admirably clear
English. It examines fiddler crabs which have been frightened and so run back to their
burrow guided by path integration. The Results show that crabs may get distracted from
their path integration computed home trajectory by a fake entrance presented nearby.
The probability of attraction to the fake entrance drops with the distance of the fake
entrance from the real one. Data and analysis demonstrate attraction to the fake
entrance by showing that the directional error toward the fake entrance is relatively
large at the start of the analysed trajectory and small by the end, while the error to the
real entrance increases from small to large. When there is no attraction, the error to the
real entrance remains small over the whole journey.
RESPONSE: We thank the reviewer for his or her positive estimation to our paper.
We have responded point-by-point to reviewers’ comments as follows.
COMMENT 2: Where the paper falls down a bit is in discussing and analysing what
might be happening. The assumption (lines 320-322) is made that path integration is
suppressed by sight of the visual entrance. Recent discussions of similar questions in
insect navigation (e.g. Collett, M. (2012). How navigational guidance systems are
combined in a desert ant. Current Biology, 22(10), 927-932.; Wehner, R., Hoinville, T.,
Cruse, H., & Cheng, K. (2016). Steering intermediate courses: desert ants combine
information from various navigational routines. Journal of Comparative Physiology A,
202(7), 459-472.) emphasise that guidance systems tend to combine to control direction
in a weighted manner. It would be good to test whether that kind of interaction might
explain your data as well. Directional certainty in path integration is strongest when
the animal is far from its goal and becomes less as distances shorten. Thus, one might
expect that the weighting of the compromise will change during the approach and the
crab will gradually turn towards the fake entrance (cf. Bregy, P., Sommer, S., Wehner,
R., 2008. Nest- mark orientation versus vector navigation in desert ants. J. Exp. Biol.
211, 1868–1873).
RESPONSE: We deeply appreciate the reviewer’s comment about the directional
certainty in path integration. We regret that the references were not cited in the
previous manuscript, and agree the necessity to cite these prior works. At the same
time, we however consider that our data are not suitable for testing the directional
certainty. This is because we consider that the following conditions would be needed
to test the directional certainty in the fiddler crab. First, the fake entrance (visual cue)
should be located at a certain point along (or nearby) the home vector to make crabs
possible to see the fake entrance (as we suggested in the Discussion) (please note that
while desert ants could use panoramic landmarks and scenery for orientation even if
ants are distant from them, fiddler crabs do not use landmarks for orientation during
escape run and the range that crabs can detect the fake entrance [visual cue for
homing or orientation] is limited due to their perspective foreshortening). Second, the
distance between the true entrance (goal) and the fake entrance (visual cue) should be
variously changed to test how PI and visual cue are weighted (this would be similar
situation as conducted in desert ant experiment introduced in the Wehner et al.
review paper). Then, probably, if PI and visual cue are weighted, the probability that
crabs stop at the visual cue would change gradually depending on the distance (this
would be similar observation in desert ant [e.g., Bregy et al., J. Exp. Biol. 211,
1868–1873; Wystrach et al., Proc R Soc B 282:20151484]); if PI and visual cue are
mutually exclusive, the probability might show phase-transition like change with a
certain threshold value. However, in our experiment, the fake entrance was
translocated with various directions and distances (please see our new figures, figure
2b and 4c in the revised manuscript), so both conditions did not hold. For these
reasons, we consider that our experiment is not suitable for testing the directional
certainty. We are now planning to conduct an experiment in this situation and intend
to report it in a later paper.
Accordingly, to cite the references about the directional certainty and explain their
relevance to our study, we have revised some texts from (Line 55);
“While animals use PI as a primary strategy in unfamiliar environments or vast,
featureless areas, such as desert ants foraging in the Saharan salt pans, they usually
use it as a backup strategy to other navigational strategies (e.g. visual orientation by
landmarks and olfactory cues) in familiar circumstances [5–8].”
to
“Previously, it was considered that although animals use PI as a primary strategy in
unfamiliar environments or vast, featureless areas, such as desert ants foraging in the
Saharan salt pans, they usually use it as a backup strategy to other navigational
strategies (e.g. visual orientation by landmarks and olfactory cues) in familiar
circumstances [5–8]. Recent experiments on insect navigation, however, emphasise
that such guidance systems tend to combine with the control direction in a weighted
manner [9–13].”
And from (Line 351),
“These findings indicate that the PI system can be suppressed by the visual system in
fiddler crabs. Such an interaction between the PI and visual mechanisms has also
been found in other animals. For instance, desert ants give priority to information
from a landmark cue rather than from PI if there is a conflict between the two during
their long journey, but then continue to follow the path given by PI if no further cue
appears [7]; (omission) Thus, such animals use PI as a backup strategy for navigation
[5,7]. However, as mentioned previously, the escape runs of fiddler crabs depend
almost exclusively on PI whether there is a landmark near to them or another crab’s
burrow at a closer distance [9]. (omission) Thus, PI and the visual system in fiddler
crabs may be mutually mediated to achieve their characteristic rapid homing
behaviour, rather than one acting as a backup for the other.”

“These findings indicate that the PI system can be suppressed by the visual system in

their long journey, but then continue to follow the path given by PI if no further cue
appears [7]; (omission) Thus, such animals were considered to use PI as a backup
strategy for navigation [5,7]. However, recent studies, in particular on desert ants,
presented an alternative explanation that the PI system and landmark guidance
(and/or other navigational strategies) could be in operation simultaneously [9–13]. In
other words, there is a heterarchical network among different navigational systems,
in which systems tend to combine to control the direction in a weighted manner,
rather than a dominant hierarchy. For instance, desert ant’s directional certainty in PI
is the strongest when the it is far from its goal and becomes less as distances shorten
[11,12].
Regarding this point, our results suggest that the navigation system of a
fiddler crab is also heterarchical, but whether it is performed in a weighted manner
remains unclear. As mentioned previously, the escape runs of fiddler crabs depend
almost exclusively on PI whether there is a landmark near to them or another crab’s
burrow at a closer distance [14]. (omission) Thus, although results observed in the
desert ant suggest that in fiddler crab as well the weighted manner is in two systems,
the possibility still remains that they are mutually exclusive with an immediate shift
from one to the other. However, in any case, PI and the visual system in fiddler crabs
may be mutually mediated to achieve their characteristic rapid homing behaviour,
rather than one acting as a dominant strategy or backup for the other.”

What is resolution of the camera (pixels by pixels) and its frame rate? Please do supply
these details.

recording set up. In accordance with the comment 1 of the editor and the reviewer’s
comment, we have added the information in the Methods (Please see also our
response to comment 2 of the editor).
We wish to thank the Reviewer #1 again for his or her valuable comments.
RESPONSES TO THE REVIER 2:
We wish to express our appreciation to the reviewer for his or her insightful comments,
which have helped us significantly improve the paper.
COMMENT 1: This manuscript addresses an interesting question, but fails to present
an adequate analysis.
It is of great interest to understand how animals integrate different sources of
information in order to guide behaviour. In this particular case, fiddler crabs were
confronted with an experimentally induced conflict between their burrow location as
defined by the home vector computed through path integration and the location of a
visible, but fake, burrow entrance. Whether or not they are attracted away from the end
of their home vector and toward the fake burrow depends on the spatial relationship
between the fake and the real burrow position and most importantly the direction from
which the crabs approach the two.
RESPONSE: We thank the reviewer for this general comment to our paper. We have
responded point-by-point to reviewers’ comments as follows.
Major concerns
COMMENT 2: As far as I can see, your analysis does not capture a crucially
important aspect of the interaction between path integration and visual goal
recognition, namely the distance at which crabs can see a fake burrow, or to say it
differently the point along the path at which they change direction in relation to the fake
burrow and the end of their home vector. Moreover, the spatial relationships between
fake and true burrow positions and the direction of approach are not adequately (or at
least in a way that is not easily understandable) accounted for in the present analysis.
RESPONSE: We would like to address this comment in our response to comment 3
of the reviewer 2.
COMMENT 3: To capture this, a proper path analysis should be conducted (the time
course of running direction relative to the angular position of targets (or target
direction); time course of running direction/speed and distance to targets ect).
RESPONSE: We appreciate the reviewer's interest in additional information on the
distance at which crabs can see a fake burrow, or to say it differently the point along
the path at which they change direction in relation to the fake burrow and the end of
their home vector. Before responding to this comment, we would like to confirm that
our goals in this paper are to address the following questions;
(1) Does fiddler crab use a burrow entrance as a visual cue for homing behavior
(while it has been considered that the fiddler crabs rely almost exclusively on PI
to return to their burrows unlike insect navigation)?
(2) If (1) is yes, when (i.e., after, before or during homing run) does it react to the
entrance?
(3) What do factors affect crab’s decision (i.e., returned to true burrow or fake
entrance)?
To address these, we conducted an experiment in which the fake entrance was
distributed with “various” distances and relative directions to the true entrance.
Especially, in connection with the reviewer’s comment, for question (2) we
concluded that “during”, rather than before or after, homing run the crab reacted to
the entrance. Then, while we agree with the reviewer’s comment that “exactly when”
the crab changes the direction is a crucially important aspect of the interaction
between path integration and visual goal recognition, we consider that it lies beyond
the scope of our paper and our data are not suitable for testing it. This is because the
point at which the crab changes its direction would depend on the spatial relation
between the fake and true entrances, and so we consider that more strict condition
would be needed. That is, we consider that the fake entrance should be located at a
point with a “fixed” relative direction and distance to the true entrance (we consider
that a condition that the direction between the true entrance and the fake entrance is
perpendicular to the direction of home vector is probably adequate). However, in our
experiment, the fake entrance was translocated with “various” directions and
distances (please see our new figure, figure 2b and 4c in the revised manuscript), so
such a condition did not hold. Hence, we consider that while our experiment
specified that “during” rather than before or after the crab reacted to the entrance, it is
not suitable for testing “exactly when” the crab changes the direction during the run.
We are now planning to conduct an experiment in this context and intend to report it
in a later paper.
Moreover, we conducted the time course analysis as follows (time course of mean
value etc. were calculated in the same manner as that of error from direct path model
in figure 5e and f);
(a) The time course of the running directions relative to the direction from crab’s
position to the true entrance (blue) and the fake entrance (red) in F event (right)
and T event (left), where solid lines show the circular mean and dotted lines show
95% confidential interval. These show similar results observed in our time course
analysis of error from direct path models (figure 5e and f); in T event, the running
direction relative to the direction to the true entrance vs. time curve was always
lower than that to the fake entrance curve during escape runs except when
normalized time exceeds around 0.85. Intersection of the two lines caused
probably because some crabs passed the true entrance before they stopped, at

However, we are uncertain that we can estimate “exactly when” the crab changes its
direction by these analyses. Moreover, we consider that the characteristics obtained
from above analyses (especially in (a) and (b)) could be also observed in analysis of
the error from the direct path models (figure 5) (i.e., both in (a) and figure 5f; there is
an intersection in the middle of the escape run in F event, while there does not exist
in T event; the distance to the true entrance was finally smaller than that to the fake
entrance in T event and the reverse was true in F event.). Furthermore, the error from
the direct path model does not show the jump up at final stage observed in (a), so we
consider that it is easier than (a) (i.e., time course of the relative running direction) to
understand how much there is the error from the path to the entrance (or from the
direct path model). Hence, we have decided not to add these analyses to the text and
would like to retain the original analysis about the error from direct path models.
COMMENT 4: Because the crabs’ movements are rather fast, this should be done at
full frame rate (50fps?) and not with a down-sampled frame rate of currently 10fps. For
instance: in the most interesting and informative Fig. 3 (which, however, is not being
referred to in the text), the example paths for ‘F-events’ are curved, meaning that the
crabs steer towards the visible burrow entrance, but the temporal sampling is too
coarse to allow the identification of the points along the paths where the crabs first
change their running direction.
RESPONSE: We filmed at 30 fps and digitized every 3rd frame in the previous
manuscript, but we re-digitized frame-by-frame in the revised manuscript. Please see
also our response to comment 2 of the editor.
Moreover, please note that we already referred Fig. 3 in the text (Line 245 in the
previous manuscript).
COMMENT 5: You should emphasize more clearly that this is an example of a very
fast and multi-modal ‘decision-making’ process, which is of great interest, especially
when considering its neural implementation.
RESPONSE: We wish to express our deep appreciation to the reviewer for his/her
critical comment. We have added the text as it is in the Discussion (Line 382);
“Then, this would be an example of a very fast and multi-modal decision-making
process, which is of great interest, especially when considering its neural
implementation.”
Detailed comments & suggestions
COMMENT 6: Line 63: ‘...or visiting females...’. Not all fiddler crab males do this. It
depends on the mating system, so better: ‘... as a hub for foraging or attracting or
visiting females...’
RESPONSE: We thank the reviewer on this point. This has been revised in
accordance with the reviewer's comment.
COMMENT 7: Line 65: References 13, 24 and 25 actually show that very active males
use a self-constructed ‘landmark’ to help them relocating their burrows...
RESPONSE: To note the self-constructed landmark in advance, we have added the
following text here;
“with exceptions [21–23] mentioned later.”
COMMENT 8: Line 75: Add ref 9 to ref 15 here to back up the statement that crabs
compensate for passive rotation.
RESPONSE: We have added it in accordance with the reviewer's comment.
COMMENT 9: Line 75ff: better: ‘...do not compensate for passive translation’.
RESPONSE: This has been revised in accordance with the reviewer's comment.
COMMENT 10: Line 76ff: better: ‘...when a foraging crab is shifted, for instance, on
a sliding sheet of sand paper, it subsequently returns to its burrow by following a
straight path...’
RESPONSE: This has been revised in accordance with the reviewer's comment.
COMMENT 11: Line79ff: ‘...suggest that visual recognition of landmarks or the
burrow itself is only activated towards the end of the home vector.’ Comment: there are
actually a number of studies in insect navigation that have shown that (1) desert ants
only respond to the CO2 plume of nests towards the end of their home vector
(Buehlmann, C., Hansson, B. S., & Knaden, M. (2012). Path integration controls nest
plume following in desert ants. Current Biology, 22(7), 645-649) and (2) also to
landmarks (P. Bregy, S. Sommer, R. Wehner Nest-mark orientation versus vector
navigation in desert ants J. Exp. Biol., 211 (2008), pp. 1868–1873).
RESPONSE: We wish to thank the reviewer for this comment. We consider that the
reviewer’s comment is correct for the studies of insect navigation. But, we here
(around Line 79 in the previous manuscript) focused on the homing behaviour of the
fiddler crab, and consider our original text to be along with the explanation of
previous studies on homing behaviour of the fiddler crab (e.g., Layne et al., J. Exp.
Biol. 206, 4413–4423). Thus, we would like to retain the original text. On the other
hand, we agree with the relevance of the references raised here by the reviewer, and
have added them and explained the relevance to our study with additional texts in the
Discussion (please see our response to comment 1 of the reviewer #1 in this regard).
COMMENT 12: Line 84: ‘idiothetic’ means ‘without external reference cues’ and is a
very special case. PI accumulates errors simply because it requires integration of noisy
sensory signals, such as compass direction or odometry.
RESPONSE: We wish to thank the reviewer for this comment. In accordance with
the reviewer’s comment, we have decided to remove the regarding words “based on
idiothetic cues”.
COMMENT 13: Line 93: better ‘...may use the burrow entrance...’
RESPONSE: This has been revised in accordance with the reviewer's comment.
COMMENT 14: Line 132: Give resolution of camera or video in pixels, approximate
recording area in cm and frame rate in frames per second.
RESPONSE: In accordance with the reviewer’s comment, we have added the
information in the Methods. Please see also our response to comment 2 of the editor.
COMMENT 15: Line 166: Your tracking interval suggests that you filmed at 50 fps
and digitized crab positions every 5th frame?
RESPONSE: In this regard, we have added the explanation about recording set up.
Please see our response to comment 2 of the editor and our response to comment 4 of
the reviewer #2.
COMMENT 16: Line 178: Translocation distance is not the only variable that is
important in this context, but also the direction of the home vector relative to the line
connecting the fake and the true burrow. It would be much more adequate to first find a
better description of the geometry of the situation and secondly a statistic that helps to
identify the ‘decision points’ along the crabs’ paths.
RESPONSE: We appreciate the reviewer for this comment about the geometry
among crab’s position and those of both entrances. In both T and F events, we
calculated the relative angle between the direction of translocation (i.e., the direction
from the true entrance to the fake entrance) and the direction from crab’s starting
point to the true entrance. Then we have added the following rose diagrams of the
direction in both events as figure 2b with its caption in the revised manuscript.

“(b) The rose diagram of the direction of the translocation relative to the line
connecting the position of the true entrance and the crab’s starting point in the T
(left) and F events (right). Red lines indicate the direction and magnitude of the mean
resultant vector.”
Moreover, when we compared both data, we found that there is no significant
difference between them (Watson-Wheeler test; W = 0.358, N = 35, P = 0.836).
Accordingly, to refer these analysis, we have added the following texts in the
Methods (Line 189);
“To check the geometrical relation among the crab’s starting point and both
entrances, we calculated the relative angle between the direction of translocation (i.e.,
the direction from the true entrance to the fake entrance) and the direction from the
crab’s starting point to the true entrance.”
And in the Results (Line 259);
“The translocation direction of the fake entrance relative to the direction from the
crab’s starting point to the true entrance did not significantly differ between both
trials (Watson-Wheeler test: W = 0.358, P = 0.836, n = 35; Figure 2b)”
COMMENT 17: Line 193: I am confused about your definition of ‘initial error’ and
would prefer it to be defined in terms of ‘error angle’ rather than projected final
minimal distance to target: From Fig. 1b I understand that you use the initial path
direction at the start of the response (not it’s velocity as such) which you then ‘scale
with the model’. I assume you mean that you then project that direction towards the
goals as shown in Fig. 1b and then define ‘initial errors’ as the smallest possible
distance to target (your dotted lines in Fig. 1b).
RESPONSE: We appreciate the reviewer’s comment on this point. However, after
calculating of the ‘error angle’ (actually, we calculated it as the running directions
relative to the direction from crab’s position to each entrance), we eventually
concluded that the error from the direct path model (that we conducted originally)
captures crab’s behavior easily rather than the error angle for several reasons, and
have decided to retain it. In this regard, please see our response to comment 3 of the
reviewer #2.
Moreover, we actually did not project but scale the length of a vector whose direction
corresponded to the crab’s velocity with the direct path model.
Furthermore, we are uncertain as to the meaning of the reviewer's comment smallest
“possible” distance to target. As we noted in the Methods (), “we defined an initial
error as the distance between the end of the model (entrance location) and the end of
a vector whose direction corresponded to the crab’s velocity at the starting point and
whose length was scaled with the model”. By this definition, one error value is
determined for one model. Hence, we did not consider about possible distance.
COMMENT 18: Line 221: better: ‘if it was visible. We found that ... entrances were
visible ...’
RESPONSE: This has been revised in accordance with the reviewer's comment.
COMMENT 19: Line 247ff: See my comments above: The crabs’ decisions also
depend on the foraging direction relative to the line connecting fake and real burrow.
RESPONSE: In this regard, we have conducted additional analysis. Please see our
response to comment 16 of the reviewer #2.
COMMENT 20: Line 269ff: This is the interesting finding, but your makes a few
important aspects difficult to judge: Your Fig. 5f seems to suggest that the ‘F-model’
error decreases right from the start of the response at a mean distance of 3 cm, which is
well within the visual contact distance of fiddler crabs to their burrow, which is about 5
times the eye height above ground (see Fig. 6, Zeil J, Layne J (2002) Path integration in
fiddler crabs and its relation to habitat and social life. In: Wiese K (ed) Crustacean
Experimental Systems in Neurobiology, Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, Berlin New York,
pp227-247.; Ribeiro, P.D., J.H. Christy, R.J. Rissanen, and T.W. Kim. 2006. Males are
attracted by their own courtship signals. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology
61:81–89.; Fig. 18.2 in Zeil J, Hemmi JM (2014) Path Integration, Vision and
Decision-making in Fiddler Crabs. In: Derby CD, Thiel M (eds) Crustacean Nervous
Systems and their Control of Behavior. Vol 3 of The Natural History of Crustaceans
(ten-volume series, editor-in-chief, M. Thiel). Oxford Univ. Press, New York, pp
484-508.). For U. perplexa, which have carapace widths/eye heights between 0.8 and
1.7 cm, this would translate into a detection distance range between 4 and 8.5 cm!
RESPONSE: We deeply appreciate the reviewer for this comment. As the reviewer
noted, the visual contact distance would be a key factor for the crab’s daily life, but
we consider that it would not affect our results for the following reasons.
(1) As previous studies reported (e.g., Zeil et al., J. Comp. Physiol. A 183, 367–377;
Cannicci et al., Ethology 105, 867–880), crabs that are actively feeding do not
respond to the passive translocation, although the surroundings within the visual
contact distance could be perceived to be moving.
(2) Also in our experiment, crabs did not respond to the translocation of the seat
(fake entrance).
(3) Our logistic regression analysis showed that even if the distance between a crab
and a fake entrance at the starting point is ranged within the visual contact
distance it did not significantly affect the crab’s decision (burrow selection).
For these reasons, we consider that though crabs and the entrance are within the
contact distance, it would not affect our results. To explain this point, we have added
the following text in the Discussion (Line 328).
“Note that, in some trials, the crab’s starting point and the fake entrance might be
within its visual contact distance that is approximately five times the eye height
above ground [21,31,32] and is roughly estimated between 4 and 8.5 cm for U.
perplexa. Considering this, it should be noted again that there is a possibility that
crabs in such trials perceived the fake entrance before being frightened. However,
this would be unlikely for the following reasons; first, crabs that are actively feeding
do not respond to the passive translocation, although the surroundings within the
visual contact distance could be perceived to be moving; second, crabs in our
experiment as well did not respond to the translocation of the seat; third, as we
mentioned in the Results, our logistic regression analysis showed that even if the
distance between a crab and the fake (or true) entrance at the starting point is ranged
within the visual contact distance it did not significantly affect the crab’s burrow
selection (Figure 4b and c). Therefore, we concluded it unlikely that crabs perceive
the fake entrance as the goal of their path before the run.”
Accordingly, we have added the following references:

social life. In Crustacean Experimental Systems in Neurobiology (ed Wiese K), pp.
227–247. Berlin: Springer Verlag.

Crabs. In Crustacean Nervous Systems and their Control of Behavior (eds Derby CD,
Thiel M), pp. 484–508. New York: Oxford University Press.
Moreover, to make (3) clearer, we have added new figures as figure 4b and c in the
revised manuscript that shows results from single regression with the distance to each
entrance. Accordingly, we have added these results to Table 1 and the following text
(Line 271);
“We also plotted F events and T events against the distances to the fake entrance and
the true burrow and conducted a logistic regression (Figure 4b and c).”
COMMENT 21: Line 290ff: The formation of a home vector without visual contact
with a goal is the ‘trick’ of path integration. So I am not sure why you find this
‘remarkable’.
RESPONSE: We wish to thank the reviewer for this comment. In accordance with
the reviewer’s comment, we have decided to remove the regarding words “they are
remarkable in that”.
COMMENT 22: Line 332ff regarding cue use depending on the state of the path
integrator, see: Buehlmann, C., Hansson, B. S., & Knaden, M. (2012). Path integration

RESPONSE: We have cited the references and explained the relevance to our study
with additional texts. Please see our response to comment 2 of the reviewer #1.
We wish to thank the Reviewer #2 again for his or her valuable comments.
Appendix B
GENERAL COMMENTS
We first note that we found mistakes after submitting previous MS.
First, in the Discussion, we forgot to revise the following text from (L318 in the
previous MS)
“However, we observed that the crabs sometimes ran towards the fake entrance without
stopping at the true burrow and that their running speed did not differ from that when
they directly moved to the location of the true burrow.”
to
“However, we observed that the crabs sometimes ran towards the fake entrance without
stopping at the true burrow.”
This should had been done because in the previous revision we found there is
significant but slight difference in running speeds during escape runs between the two
events.
Next, we found that we made a confusing mistake in noting the name of statistical test.
We should had noted “Wilcoxon rank-sum test” that we actually used in our analysis,
instead of “Wilcoxon singed-rank test” that is used when comparing two related
samples and thus is not related our analysis. We have revised all regarding text
involving this term.
Moreover, we have revised the following text (caption for figure 6b) from;
“(b) Difference between the total path length and the sum of the distance between the
true burrow and the fake entrance in F events.”
to
“(b) Difference between the total path length and the sum of the length of a direct path
to the true burrow and the distance between the true burrow and the fake entrance in F
events.”
This was an oversight from an earlier version of MS.
We regret and would like to apologize for these errors.
RESPONSES TO THE REVIER 2:
COMMENT 1: Thanks for considering my comments and please follow up with a more
detailed analysis of fine-grained paths!
RESPONSE: We deeply appreciate again for careful comments to our revised
manuscript from the reviewer, and are grateful for the time and energy you expended
on our behalf. In the same time, we would like to apologize for our poor English.
COMMENT 2: L65: Please check references here: 21&22 are studies of ‘pure’ PI and
23 does not treat PI in crabs, but mammals. The exceptions to the ‘exclusive use of PI’
are references 29 and 30.
RESPONSE: We thank the reviewer for this comment. We found that the reference
list in the previous MS was misarranged. Then we have corrected the list and
rechecked throughout the References. We would like to apologize for this error.
COMMENT 3: L78: it may be better to replace ‘seat’ by ‘sheet’.
RESPONSE: This error has been corrected.
COMMENT 4: L116ff: There is no need for the confusing term ‘pseudo homing error’.
I suggest removing it altogether by asking whether the crabs correct for the mismatch
between their true burrow location and the fake burrow entrance ect.
RESPONSE: In accordance with the reviewer’s comment, to remove “pseudo
homing error” altogether we have revised the following text from (L117);
“… the fake entrance was shown and the true entrance was masked by an oblong
structure (referred to as a “pseudo homing error”) and the distance over which the
oblong sheet was translocated was varied (this translocation distance corresponds to
the size of the pseudo homing error).”
to
“… the fake entrance was shown and the true entrance was masked by an oblong
structure (referred to as a “pseudo homing error”) and the distance over which the
oblong sheet was translocated was varied (this translocation distance corresponds to
the size of the pseudo homing error).”
And from (L120);
“… up to which the crabs can compensate the errors. We next determined whether
the crabs compensate the pseudo homing error before …”
to
“… up to which the crabs can compensate for the mismatch between their true
burrow location and the fake burrow entrance. We next determined whether the crabs
compensate it before …”
And from (L167);
“… the crabs were compensating for the pseudo homing error …”
to
“… the crabs were compensating for the mismatch between their true burrow
location and the fake burrow entrance …”
And from (L200);
“… the fiddler crabs could compensate for pseudo homing error, …”
to
“… the fiddler crabs could compensate, …”
And from (L245);
“… a mismatch between the location of an entrance and the end of the home vector
(i.e., pseudo homing error),”
to
“… a mismatch between the location of an entrance and the end of the home vector,”
And from (L318);
“… a fake entrance was employed as a visual cue for a pseudo homing error.”
to
“… a fake entrance was employed as a visual cue.”
COMMENT 5: L132: better: …during the day from 1.5 hrs before to 1.5 hrs after low
tide in August…’
RESPONSE: This has been revised in accordance with the reviewer’s comment.
COMMENT 6: L133: ‘…that show…’
RESPONSE: This error has been corrected.
COMMENT 7: L134ff: ‘…using a Panasonic …conversion lens (0.75x) on a tripod
resulting in a recording area of 2x1.7m.’
RESPONSE: We actually used a four-legged steel frame instead of a tripod. Hence,
we have revised the regarding text from (L137),
“… conversion lens (0.75 ×), whose field of view is 3 × 1.7 m.”
to
“… conversion lens (0.75 ×) on a four-legged steel frame resulting in a recording
area of 3 × 1.7 m.”
And from (L139);
“… in the field of view.”
to
“… in the area.”

RESPONSE: This has been revised in accordance with the reviewer’s comment.
COMMENT 13: L179ff: I do not understand your stopping point criterion, because the
criteria all involve movement of the crab...?
RESPONSE: We have revised the following text from (L178);
“We considered the starting point of an escape run as a crab’s position at a frame
after being frightened and when it moved at least 3.33 mm in the 33.3 ms time
interval preceding this frame and at least 10.0 mm over a three-frame interval (100
ms) starting at the previous frame, and the stopping point as a frame after the starting
point and when the crab moved at most 3.33 mm in the 33.3 ms time interval
preceding this frame and at most 10.0 mm over a three-frame interval starting at the
previous frame.”
to
“We considered the starting point of an escape run as a crab’s position at a frame
after being frightened and when it moved larger than 3.33 mm in the 33.3 ms time
interval preceding this frame and larger than 10.0 mm over a three-frame interval
(100 ms) starting at the previous frame, and the stopping point as a crab’s position at
a frame after the starting point and when it moved smaller than 3.33 mm in the 33.3
ms time interval preceding this frame and smaller than 10.0 mm over a three-frame
interval starting at the previous frame.”
COMMENT 14: L260: ‘...did not differ significantly between...’
RESPONSE: This has been revised in accordance with the reviewer’s comment.
COMMENT 15: L308ff: The logic of this sentence continues to be obscure due to
‘Although’ at the beginning and ‘even’ at the end. Why don’t you simply state that
fiddler crabs use path integration to locate their burrows from distances at which they
cannot see the burrow.
RESPONSE: We wish to thank the reviewer on this point. We have revised
regarding sentence in accordance with the reviewer’s comment from (L312):
“Although the foraging excursions of fiddler crabs are carried out over a shorter
range than those of desert ants and honeybees, the crabs can form a home vector even
when they have no visual contact with their burrows. When disturbed, fiddler crabs
“play out” the vector …”
to
“Fiddler crabs use path integration to locate their burrows from distances at which
they cannot see the burrow. When disturbed, fiddler crabs “play out” the home vector
…”
COMMENT 16: L336: ‘...of the platform..’
RESPONSE: This has been revised in accordance with the reviewer’s comment.
COMMENT 17: L338: ‘...starting point is within the visual contact distance...’
RESPONSE: This has been revised in accordance with the reviewer’s comment.
COMMENT 18: L360ff: I am not convinced by this discussion which you added
because of Referee 1’s comments. I think that your data show no evidence of a weighted
solution to the conflict between PI and the fake burrow. The crabs would then end up at
a location half-way between the true and the fake burrow, which they clearly don’t. So
maybe you could simplify this discussion by saying something like this:
‘ At this stage, it remains to be seen whether the crabs solve conflicts between
information provided by path integration and the visual appearance of the burrow in a
weighted manner, as it has been suggested for ants [refs], or whether they switch to
visual guidance whenever the burrow entrance becomes visible.’
RESPONSE: We completely agree with the reviewer’s comment that “your data
show no evidence of a weighted solution to the conflict between PI and the fake
burrow.” However, contrasting with the weighted solution, we here discussed the
possibility that PI and visual orientation are mutually exclusive and are immediately
shifted from one to the other only if crabs approach the end of the home vector
and the burrow entrance becomes visible rather than the possibility that “they
switch to visual guidance whenever the burrow entrance becomes visible”.
Moreover, we discussed that previous studies and our result suggest that the latter
would be unlikely. Of course, to test these, an experiment such that the fake entrance
(visual cue) is located at a certain point along (or nearby) the home vector and the
distance between the true entrance (goal) and the fake entrance (visual cue) is
variously changed, as we noted here. (Please suppose that if such an experiment is
conducted, crabs switch to visual guidance whenever the burrow entrance becomes
visible. Then, this would suggest a dominant hierarchy that was previously
considered in ants and bees. However, we consider that while these should be tested,
previous studies and our result [particularly, please see figure 3b in which a crab pass
the fake entrance located along the home vector] suggest that the possibility
“whenever” would be unlikely.)
Then, to make this point clearer, we have revised the following text from (L380);
“Thus, although results observed in the desert ant suggest that in fiddler crab as well
the weighted manner is in two systems, the possibility still remains that they are
mutually exclusive with an immediate shift from one to the other.”
to
“Then, at this stage, it remains to be seen whether the crabs solve conflicts between
information provided by PI and the visual appearance of the burrow in a weighted
manner, as it has been suggested for ants [9–13], or whether PI and visual orientation
are mutually exclusive and are immediately shifted from one to the other only if
crabs approach the end of the home vector and the burrow entrance becomes visible.”
COMMENT 19: L420‘...M, Wehner R, Wolf...
RESPONSE: This error has been corrected.
COMMENT 20: Check reference list for species names that need to be in italics.
RESPONSE: We have revised species names to be in italics in reference list (ref.
14,15,28).
COMMENT 21: You could make Figures a bit more self-explanatory, e.g.:
Fig. 2b: Include schematic of angles.
RESPONSE: We wish to thank the reviewer for this comment. We have added
schematic of angle to figure 1a as follows.
(a)
1 3
<U+03B8>
2 10 cm
T F
30 cm
Accordingly, we have added the following text in the caption of figure 1.
“Moreover, to check the geometrical relation among the crab’s starting point and
both entrances, we calculated the relative angle between the direction of translocation
and the direction from the crab’s starting point to the true entrance (solid arc labelled
“<U+03B8>”), which corresponds as in figure 2b.”
Moreover, we have added the reference to this in the text (L195).
COMMENT 22: Fig. 3: Label top row T-events and bottom row F-events. Include as
inset: Red: Fake burrow; Blue: True burrow.
RESPONSE: We have revised in accordance with the reviewer’s comment.
COMMENT 23: Fig. 5: Label Top row: Initial error; Middle row: Final error
RESPONSE: We are uncertain as to the meaning of the reviewer's comment. We
already labeled these in Fig.5 (in PDF for review, line number makes it illegible, but
original file is OK). Hence, we would like to retain the original figure.
Thank you again for your comments on our paper.
