Review of Royal Society Open Science RSOS-2017-171561
Hermine Alexandre, Julie Faure, Steven Ginzbarg, John Clark and Simon Joly
“Parallel diversifications of Cremastosperma and Mosannona (Annonaceae), tropical rainforest
trees tracking Neogene upheaval of South America”
Thanks for inviting me to review this manuscript. This study investigates the historical
biogeography of the Annonaceae genera Cremastosperma (49 accessions, 24 of the 29 described
species) and Mosannona (21 accessions, 11 of the 14 recognized species), and their evolution in
Neotropical rainforests. The authors use cpDNA (3–5 markers) and nrDNA (malate synthase,
phytochrome C) sequence datasets, including those partially successful, of accessions
representing 35 (81%) of the currently accepted 43 species in the clade. This is an interesting
dataset, with taxon sampling to about 81% of the species diversity in both clades. Ancestral
divergence time estimation and species distribution modelling were employed. The data and
analyses presented in this manuscript are very interesting, the study is logically presented, well-
written, most of the conclusions are supported by the data and are certainly worth of publication
in Royal Society Open Science. However, I think some methodological aspects require additional
attention. This applies to (1) the species distribution modelling, where the inferences of species
distribution models in some cases were based on few presence records, a practice that has been
criticized in the literature and the accuracy of which needs to be evaluated by removing those
species; and (2) a discussion about the pseudo-congruence between Cremastosperma and
Mosannona tree topologies. I feel these issues would require some more attention. In sum, I
believe this is a novel, well-executed study on a very interesting system that will interest the
readers of Royal Society Open Science. I found no major drawbacks in the manuscript and no
major issues need to be addressed before the manuscript is ready for publication. While I am
positive about this fine study, minor suggestions for improvement include:
Page 3, lines 3–14. “…A further geological influence, the closing of the isthmus at Panama,
facilitating biotic interchange between North and South America, also occurred during the
Pliocene [11] and may also have driven diversification. The Panama isthmus has long been
assumed to have fully closed by 3.5 Ma. This date has been challenged recently by fossil data and
molecular phylogenetic analyses that may indicate migration across that Panama isthmus dating
back to the Early Miocene, c. 6-7 Ma [19–22]. Finally, distribution shifts along the Andean
elevational range during climatic changes in the Pleistocene (c. 1.8 Ma onwards) may also have
driven diversification [23]..” Is there any biogeographical study of bird lineages that might be
linked to the possibility of long-distance dispersals (as oppossed to only vicariance events, if
these trees are vector seed dispersed? Also, provide some basic information about the pollinators
and seed dispersers of these trees, if vectors are needed, that migth have facilitated early
dispersal across biogeographical regions, particularly across the Isthmus of Panama and earlier
than the 3.5 Ma assumed date.

Page 4, lines 3–26. Not clear whether the two independent studies, Cremastosperma and
Mosannona tree topologies, represent independent evidence for hypothesis testing and how the
use of different molecular markers in each dataset. Please provide a couple of sentences (and
references if needed) to clarify this.
Page 7, lines 32–39. You only modelled species distributions recorded at least at four localities.
However, the effect of sample size on model accuracy is an aspect that is often neglected (Wisz et
al. 2008, Mateo et al. 2010). Ignoring this effect results in increased levels of error in distribution
models for species represented by (too) few records, which are mostly rare species (please see
recent review on this issue in Proosdij et al. 2016, Ecography 39, 542–552, doi:
10.1111/ecog.01509). According to this review, the species’ prevalence in addition to sample size,
has a strong impact on model performance; species’ prevalence is defined as the fraction of the
study area occupied by a species (McPherson et al. 2004). Model performance for ecologically and
geographically narrow-ranged species is significantly better compared to widespread species
found in a wider range of habitats (Hernandez et al. 2006, Mateo et al. 2010, Lobo and Tognelli
2011, Tessarolo et al. 2014). Identifying the lower limit of the number of records that is required to
develop accurate SDMs in relation to the species’ prevalence is therefore highly topica. For
instance, model performance is known to rapidly decrease for sample sizes smaller than 20
(Stockwell and Peterson 2002) or 15 (Papes and Gaubert 2007), and is dramatically poor for
samples sizes smaller than 5 records (Pearson et al. 2007). Contrary to this, high model accuracy
was observed using several modelling techniques for models based on samples as small as 5, 10
and 25 compared to models based on 100 samples (Hernandez et al. 2006). Given that the true
distribution of a species is unknown, model evaluation in these studies is based on in-sample test
data and not on independent test data. Please provide evidence that low levels of errors
characterize the projected models (or do not violate the assumptions of SDM), particularly for the
regressions presented in Fig. 4, graphs showing the correlation per genus between Hellinger’s I
metric and patristic distances.
Page 8, lines 12–36. For model performance, you have used the ‘area under the curve’ (AUC [58])
that is calculated by Maxent. However, its utility has been criticized for reasons you have
acknowledged and, therefore, used a phylogenetically controlled null model approach, in which
100 replicate SDMs were generated for each species using random locality points in the same
numbers as the original locality points. However, I am not sure whether this approach is a good
one for choosing the threshold. MaxEnt simultaneously analyzes two types of data, a training
data set and a test data set, and then by comparing the two analyses using several different
metrics the model accuracy can be estimated. Minimum training presence (MinTPLT) is a metric
of the logistic threshold that results in inclusion of all training presences. The 10th percentile
threshold (T10LT) assumes that 10% of occurrence records are erroneous to due factors such as
low-resolution environmental data, and therefore excludes all probability values below the
highest 10% of records. Equal Training Sensitivity and Specificity Logistic Threshold (ETSSLT),
which was highlighted by Liu et al. (2005, Ecography 28: 385–393.) as one of the best 5 decision
thresholds, indicating that it selects a model that has the same probability of predicting real
presences as real absences. Therefore, you may want to use the true skill statistic (TSS), a
threshold-dependent measure of model performance that evaluates the accuracy of predictive
maps generated by presence-only data (Allouche et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2013), to evaluate the ideal
cut suitability threshold of the modelled species into presence/absence maps. TSS corresponds to
the sum of sensitivity and specificity minus one (the sensitivity is the proportion of presences
correctly predicted, and the specificity is the proportion of absences correctly predicted). The TSS
is calculated for each replicate using the minimum training presence logistic threshold
(MinTPLT), the 10th percentile training presence logistic threshold (T10LT) and the equal training
sensitivity and specificity logistic threshold (ETSSLT), and then TSS values are averaged among
replicates. TSS varies from -1 to +1, where negative and around zero values indicate that
4
distributions are no better than random, while values ranging between 0.4–0.8 are considered as
acceptable models (Landis and Koch, 1977; Fielding and Bell, 1997).
Page 11, lines 12–25. The phylogenetic hypotheses for Cremastosperma and Mosannona showed
strong geographic signal, with clades endemic both to regions divided by obvious present day
dispersal barriers (east and west of the Andes), and to regions that are currently largely
contiguous (i.e. within Amazonia). These results appear to contrast with the assumptions of rapid
dispersal abilities of Amazon biota [63,64], such as species-rich Neotropical lowland clades [65]
including the more typically Amazon-centred, more widely distributed, Annonaceae genus
Guatteria [66]. The strong correlation between phylogenetic patterns and geographic areas found
here resembles more closely the patterns found in Neotropical birds [67]. By looking at the tree
topologies presented in Figs. 1 and 2, the split between the Venezuelan and/or Guianan clades
and the western/Pacific/Central American clades for Cremastosperma do not match that
observed in Mosannona (the splits in the tree topologies are not spatially congruent). The ages of
lineages might be similar, but the interpretation of such incongruence is not clearly stated. Please
provide some clarification on this issue, or isn’t relevant? In fact, the topologies suggest that the
two studies of suposedly independent lineages are not evolutionary parallelisms within
Annonaceae.
Figure 3. I believe this figure needs to be improved. For instance, the vertical lines could be
removed, only the vertical shadings indicating the Miocene and Pleistocene are needed. Also,
remove the white within the map insets (make it transparent), so the maps are not overimposed.
A key of what A1, B1, etc. nodes mean is needed on the figure, so the reader does not need to
read the legend or the corresponding table.
Figure 4. Perhaps a drawing or photograph of a typical Cremastosperma and Mosannona species
would highlight the correlations presented.

This is a great addition to the growing body of literature on Northern South American
biogeography. The data is extensive in terms of taxa and genes and the analyses are all
appropriate.
I think it is worth mentioning that low passes in the Cordillera Oriental between the Merida
Andes and Norte de Santander and also adjacent to La Macarena mean that the Eastern
Cordillera may not represent that great a barrier to some lowland distributed organisms.
Interesting the suggestion that different dispersal abilities might account for different degrees of
geographic structure between canopy trees and understorey ones. What are the distributions of
the potential dispersers? Do they exhibit geographic structure in their distributions or
phylogenies? The following examples in other families could be contradictory to this suggestion
and therefore should perhaps be cited.

“Parallel diversifications of Cremastosperma and Mosannona (Annonaceae), tropical rainforest
trees tracking Neogene upheaval of South America”
Thanks for inviting me to review this manuscript. This study investigates the historical
biogeography of the Annonaceae genera Cremastosperma (49 accessions, 24 of the 29 described
species) and Mosannona (21 accessions, 11 of the 14 recognized species), and their evolution in
Neotropical rainforests. The authors use cpDNA (3–5 markers) and nrDNA (malate synthase,
phytochrome C) sequence datasets, including those partially successful, of accessions
representing 35 (81%) of the currently accepted 43 species in the clade. This is an interesting
dataset, with taxon sampling to about 81% of the species diversity in both clades. Ancestral
divergence time estimation and species distribution modelling were employed. The data and
analyses presented in this manuscript are very interesting, the study is logically presented, well-
written, most of the conclusions are supported by the data and are certainly worth of publication
in Royal Society Open Science. However, I think some methodological aspects require additional
attention. This applies to (1) the species distribution modelling, where the inferences of species
distribution models in some cases were based on few presence records, a practice that has been
criticized in the literature and the accuracy of which needs to be evaluated by removing those
species; and (2) a discussion about the pseudo-congruence between Cremastosperma and
Mosannona tree topologies. I feel these issues would require some more attention. In sum, I
believe this is a novel, well-executed study on a very interesting system that will interest the
readers of Royal Society Open Science. I found no major drawbacks in the manuscript and no
major issues need to be addressed before the manuscript is ready for publication. While I am
positive about this fine study, minor suggestions for improvement include:
Page 3, lines 3–14. “…A further geological influence, the closing of the isthmus at Panama,
facilitating biotic interchange between North and South America, also occurred during the

Mosannona tree topologies, represent independent evidence for hypothesis testing and how the
use of different molecular markers in each dataset. Please provide a couple of sentences (and
references if needed) to clarify this.
Page 7, lines 32–39. You only modelled species distributions recorded at least at four localities.
However, the effect of sample size on model accuracy is an aspect that is often neglected (Wisz et
al. 2008, Mateo et al. 2010). Ignoring this effect results in increased levels of error in distribution
models for species represented by (too) few records, which are mostly rare species (please see
recent review on this issue in Proosdij et al. 2016, Ecography 39, 542–552, doi:
10.1111/ecog.01509). According to this review, the species’ prevalence in addition to sample size,
has a strong impact on model performance; species’ prevalence is defined as the fraction of the
study area occupied by a species (McPherson et al. 2004). Model performance for ecologically and
geographically narrow-ranged species is significantly better compared to widespread species
found in a wider range of habitats (Hernandez et al. 2006, Mateo et al. 2010, Lobo and Tognelli
2011, Tessarolo et al. 2014). Identifying the lower limit of the number of records that is required to
develop accurate SDMs in relation to the species’ prevalence is therefore highly topica. For
instance, model performance is known to rapidly decrease for sample sizes smaller than 20
(Stockwell and Peterson 2002) or 15 (Papes and Gaubert 2007), and is dramatically poor for
samples sizes smaller than 5 records (Pearson et al. 2007). Contrary to this, high model accuracy
was observed using several modelling techniques for models based on samples as small as 5, 10
and 25 compared to models based on 100 samples (Hernandez et al. 2006). Given that the true
distribution of a species is unknown, model evaluation in these studies is based on in-sample test
data and not on independent test data. Please provide evidence that low levels of errors
characterize the projected models (or do not violate the assumptions of SDM), particularly for the
regressions presented in Fig. 4, graphs showing the correlation per genus between Hellinger’s I
metric and patristic distances.
Page 8, lines 12–36. For model performance, you have used the ‘area under the curve’ (AUC [58])
that is calculated by Maxent. However, its utility has been criticized for reasons you have

100 replicate SDMs were generated for each species using random locality points in the same
numbers as the original locality points. However, I am not sure whether this approach is a good
one for choosing the threshold. MaxEnt simultaneously analyzes two types of data, a training
data set and a test data set, and then by comparing the two analyses using several different
metrics the model accuracy can be estimated. Minimum training presence (MinTPLT) is a metric
of the logistic threshold that results in inclusion of all training presences. The 10th percentile
threshold (T10LT) assumes that 10% of occurrence records are erroneous to due factors such as
low-resolution environmental data, and therefore excludes all probability values below the
highest 10% of records. Equal Training Sensitivity and Specificity Logistic Threshold (ETSSLT),
which was highlighted by Liu et al. (2005, Ecography 28: 385–393.) as one of the best 5 decision
thresholds, indicating that it selects a model that has the same probability of predicting real
presences as real absences. Therefore, you may want to use the true skill statistic (TSS), a
threshold-dependent measure of model performance that evaluates the accuracy of predictive
10
maps generated by presence-only data (Allouche et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2013), to evaluate the ideal

the sum of sensitivity and specificity minus one (the sensitivity is the proportion of presences
correctly predicted, and the specificity is the proportion of absences correctly predicted). The TSS
is calculated for each replicate using the minimum training presence logistic threshold
(MinTPLT), the 10th percentile training presence logistic threshold (T10LT) and the equal training
sensitivity and specificity logistic threshold (ETSSLT), and then TSS values are averaged among
replicates. TSS varies from -1 to +1, where negative and around zero values indicate that
distributions are no better than random, while values ranging between 0.4–0.8 are considered as
acceptable models (Landis and Koch, 1977; Fielding and Bell, 1997).
Page 11, lines 12–25. The phylogenetic hypotheses for Cremastosperma and Mosannona showed
strong geographic signal, with clades endemic both to regions divided by obvious present day
dispersal barriers (east and west of the Andes), and to regions that are currently largely
contiguous (i.e. within Amazonia). These results appear to contrast with the assumptions of rapid
dispersal abilities of Amazon biota [63,64], such as species-rich Neotropical lowland clades [65]
including the more typically Amazon-centred, more widely distributed, Annonaceae genus
Guatteria [66]. The strong correlation between phylogenetic patterns and geographic areas found
here resembles more closely the patterns found in Neotropical birds [67]. By looking at the tree
topologies presented in Figs. 1 and 2, the split between the Venezuelan and/or Guianan clades
and the western/Pacific/Central American clades for Cremastosperma do not match that
observed in Mosannona (the splits in the tree topologies are not spatially congruent). The ages of
lineages might be similar, but the interpretation of such incongruence is not clearly stated. Please
provide some clarification on this issue, or isn’t relevant? In fact, the topologies suggest that the
two studies of suposedly independent lineages are not evolutionary parallelisms within
Annonaceae.

“Parallel diversifications of Cremastosperma and Mosannona (Annonaceae),
tropical rainforest trees tracking Neogene upheaval of South America”
Thanks for inviting me to review this manuscript. This study investigates
the historical biogeography of the Annonaceae genera Cremastosperma (49
accessions, 24 of the 29 described species) and Mosannona (21 accessions,
11 of the 14 recognized species), and their evolution in Neotropical
rainforests. The authors use cpDNA (3–5 markers) and nrDNA (malate
synthase, phytochrome C) sequence datasets, including those partially
successful, of accessions representing 35 (81%) of the currently accepted
43 species in the clade. This is an interesting dataset, with taxon
sampling to about 81% of the species diversity in both clades. Ancestral
divergence time estimation and species distribution modelling were
employed. The data and analyses presented in this manuscript are very
interesting, the study is logically presented, well-written, most of the
conclusions are supported by the data and are certainly worth of
publication in Royal Society Open Science. However, I think some
methodological aspects require additional attention. This applies to (1)
the species distribution modelling, where the inferences of species
distribution models in some cases were based on few presence records, a
practice that has been criticized in the literature and the accuracy of
which needs to be evaluated by removing those species;
<U+F0B7> Done – see below
and (2) a discussion about the pseudo-congruence between Cremastosperma
and Mosannona tree topologies. I feel these issues would require some more
attention. In sum, I believe this is a novel, well-executed study on a very
interesting system that will interest the readers of Royal Society Open
Science. I found no major drawbacks in the manuscript and no major issues
need to be addressed before the manuscript is ready for publication. While
I am positive about this fine study, minor suggestions for improvement
include:
Page 3, lines 3–14. “…A further geological influence, the closing of the
isthmus at Panama, facilitating biotic interchange between North and South
America, also occurred during the Pliocene [11] and may also have driven
diversification. The Panama isthmus has long been assumed to have fully
closed by 3.5 Ma. This date has been challenged recently by fossil data and
molecular phylogenetic analyses that may indicate migration across that
Panama isthmus dating back to the Early Miocene, c. 6-7 Ma [19–22].
Finally, distribution shifts along the Andean elevational range during
climatic changes in the Pleistocene (c. 1.8 Ma onwards) may also have
driven diversification [23]..” Is there any biogeographical study of bird
lineages that might be linked to the possibility of long-distance
dispersals (as oppossed to only vicariance events, if these trees are
vector seed dispersed? Also, provide some basic information about the
pollinators and seed dispersers of these trees, if vectors are needed, that
migth have facilitated early dispersal across biogeographical regions,
particularly across the Isthmus of Panama and earlier than the 3.5 Ma
assumed date.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for bringing up this issue. Observations on pollinators and
seed dispersers in Cremastosperma and Mosannona are rare. Pollination
of the Mexican subspecies Mosannona depressa subsp. abscondita by
dynastine beetles of the genus Cyclocephala is the only published
observation of pollination for any species in these genera (Schatz,
1990). We believe the effect of pollinators (mainly beetles) in the
dispersal of Annonaceae over larger distances is limited. However,
the effect of seed dispersers, and possible congruent historical
biogeographic patterns between Neotropical tree species and seed
dispersers could provide very interesting hypotheses. Much is still
unknown, but we have added the following to the introduction:
<U+F0B7> “…, e.g. resulting from dispersal by birds [19]”
<U+F0B7> and
<U+F0B7> “…Dispersal of the seeds, enclosed individually within fleshy monocarps on the end of often
contrastingly coloured stipes (Fig. 1), is likely by birds. Yet, …”
<U+F0B7> along with a new Fig. 1 with photos of typical species, including
illustration of the typical bird dispersal syndrome (red stipes
contrasting with black monocarps) of the fruits of many species. Plus
the following to the discussion (with two new references):
<U+F0B7> “Seed dispersal could have been facilitated e.g. by toucans (as reported on a herbarium label
of the Amazonian species, M. papillosa), which diversified within the region within roughly
the same timeframe [86,87].”
Page 4, lines 3–26. Not clear whether the two independent studies,
Cremastosperma and Mosannona tree topologies, represent independent
evidence for hypothesis testing and how the use of different molecular
markers in each dataset. Please provide a couple of sentences (and
references if needed) to clarify this.
<U+F0B7> These are two related but independent clades, and the datasets in
terms of markers overlap only in part because they were studied
individually using the best markers that could be obtained for each
group at the time.
<U+F0B7> To clarify, added to introduction (bold): “Our aims are to reassess the timing
and sequence of shifts in ancestral distributions in the two related but independent clades
of Cremastosperma and Mosannona”
<U+F0B7> See as already stated in the methods: “Datasets were constructed for
Cremastosperma and Mosannona in two separate studies employing different outgroup
sampling” … “Character sampling differed somewhat between Cremastosperma and
Mosannona matrices, depending on taxon-specific success with particular markers.”
Page 7, lines 32–39. You only modelled species distributions recorded at
least at four localities. However, the effect of sample size on model
accuracy is an aspect that is often neglected (Wisz et al. 2008, Mateo et
al. 2010). Ignoring this effect results in increased levels of error in
distribution models for species represented by (too) few records, which are
mostly rare species (please see recent review on this issue in Proosdij et
al. 2016, Ecography 39, 542–552, doi: 10.1111/ecog.01509)
<U+F0B7> [Indeed, we cite this paper already].
According to this review, the species’ prevalence in addition to sample
size, has a strong impact on model performance; species’ prevalence is
defined as the fraction of the study area occupied by a species (McPherson
et al. 2004). Model performance for ecologically and geographically narrow-
ranged species is significantly better compared to widespread species found
in a wider range of habitats (Hernandez et al. 2006, Mateo et al. 2010,
Lobo and Tognelli 2011, Tessarolo et al. 2014). Identifying the lower limit
of the number of records that is required to develop accurate SDMs in
relation to the species’ prevalence is therefore highly topica. For
instance, model performance is known to rapidly decrease for sample sizes
smaller than 20 (Stockwell and Peterson 2002) or 15 (Papes and Gaubert
2007), and is dramatically poor for samples sizes smaller than 5 records
(Pearson et al. 2007). Contrary to this, high model accuracy was observed
using several modelling techniques for models based on samples as small as
5, 10 and 25 compared to models based on 100 samples (Hernandez et al.
2006). Given that the true distribution of a species is unknown, model
evaluation in these studies is based on in-sample test data and not on
independent test data. Please provide evidence that low levels of errors
characterize the projected models (or do not violate the assumptions of
SDM), particularly for the regressions presented in Fig. 4, graphs showing
the correlation per genus between Hellinger’s I metric and patristic
distances.
<U+F0B7> We acknowledge the fact that the accuracy of species distribution
models can be challenged by using a small number of locality records.
A small number of collections is often the reality when studying
tropical plant species. We believe that our null model tests were set
up carefully by limiting the area from which random locality points
were drawn as much as possible. A large area, e.g. the entire
Neotropics, would almost certainly result in null model tests that
indicate that SDMs are significantly different from random. We drew
the random locality points from 1009 unique locality points where
only the most closely related species of Mosannona and Cremastosperma
(tribe Malmeeae of the Annonaceae) have been collected.
<U+F0B7> Furthermore, we have only considered differences in species
distribution models (as reflected in Hellingers I metric) from the
perspective of patterns across the entire genera Cremastosperma and
Mosannona. We refrained from making more detailed comparisons between
sister species because (1) phylogenetic relationships at the species
level were often not robustly supported and (2) averaging across
multiple species makes our comparisons of species distribution models
less susceptible to possible errors.
<U+F0B7> Niche similarity was found to be negatively correlated with
phylogenetic distance in Cremastosperma (squared Pearson correlation
R2 = 0.1933, p < 0.0001), while it was not in in Mosannona (squared
Pearson correlation R2 = 0.0392, p = 0.2207). We re-ran the
regression analyses after removing the species represented by the
smallest amount of localities (n=4, but note that these came out as
significantly non-random in the null model test). The results hardly
differed: the R-squared for Cremastosperma slightly changed to 0.200,
not for Mosannona, and the p values did not change.We added the
following to the manuscript: Even though the species distribution
models used in the regression analysis all differed significantly
from random, we tested the effect of removing the species represented
by the smallest number of localities (n=4). This resulted in no
noteworthy changes in values of R2 and p.
Page 8, lines 12–36. For model performance, you have used the ‘area under
the curve’ (AUC [58]) that is calculated by Maxent. However, its utility
has been criticized for reasons you have acknowledged and, therefore, used
a phylogenetically controlled null model approach, in which 100 replicate
SDMs were generated for each species using random locality points in the
same numbers as the original locality points. However, I am not sure
whether this approach is a good one for choosing the threshold. MaxEnt
simultaneously analyzes two types of data, a training data set and a test
data set, and then by comparing the two analyses using several different
metrics the model accuracy can be estimated. Minimum training presence
(MinTPLT) is a metric of the logistic threshold that results in inclusion
of all training presences. The 10th percentile threshold (T10LT) assumes
that 10% of occurrence records are erroneous to due factors such as low-
resolution environmental data, and therefore excludes all probability
values below the highest 10% of records. Equal Training Sensitivity and
Specificity Logistic Threshold (ETSSLT), which was highlighted by Liu et
al. (2005, Ecography 28: 385–393.) as one of the best 5 decision
thresholds, indicating that it selects a model that has the same
probability of predicting real presences as real absences. Therefore, you
may want to use the true skill statistic (TSS), a threshold-dependent
measure of model performance that evaluates the accuracy of predictive maps
generated by presence-only data (Allouche et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2013),
to evaluate the ideal cut suitability threshold of the modelled species
into presence/absence maps. TSS corresponds to the sum of sensitivity and
specificity minus one (the sensitivity is the proportion of presences
correctly predicted, and the specificity is the proportion of absences
correctly predicted). The TSS is calculated for each replicate using the
minimum training presence logistic threshold (MinTPLT), the 10th percentile
training presence logistic threshold (T10LT) and the equal training
sensitivity and specificity logistic threshold (ETSSLT), and then TSS
values are averaged among replicates. TSS varies from -1 to +1, where
negative and around zero values indicate that distributions are no better
than random, while values ranging between 0.4–0.8 are considered as
acceptable models (Landis and Koch, 1977; Fielding and Bell, 1997).
<U+F0B7> Thank you for this thoughtful comment, illustrating another approach
of dealing with the flaws in the use of AUC values. We are not sure,
however, what the reviewer means with ‘choosing the threshold’ as the
AUC is a threshold-independent measure. Raes & ter Steege (2007) have
developed a bias–corrected null model approach in response to the
inappropriateness of AUCs when analysing presence-only data and
pseudo-absences. We believe that the wide use of Raes & ter Steege’s
null model approach demonstrates its merit.
<U+F0B7> We have reason to assume that the localities represented by the
herbarium collections in our study are a reasonable approximation of
the environmental space occupied by each species, mitigating the
reviewer’s concern about erroneous occurrence records. Firstly, the
authors are the taxonomic specialists of the study group, have seen
all herbarium material available in the major herbaria worldwide.
Therefore, the identifications are correct, and the number of
collection localities can be assumed to be the maximum possible.
Furthermore, without exception the species have narrow distribution
ranges (compared to more widespread Neotropical species, also in
Annonaceae), implying that the ecological heterogeneity of each
distribution area is limited.
<U+F0B7> We have done a further test of possible inaccuracy of species
distribution models based on a limited number of occurrence data, as
explained above.
Page 11, lines 12–25. The phylogenetic hypotheses for Cremastosperma and
Mosannona showed strong geographic signal, with clades endemic both to
regions divided by obvious present day dispersal barriers (east and west of
the Andes), and to regions that are currently largely contiguous (i.e.
within Amazonia). These results appear to contrast with the assumptions of
rapid dispersal abilities of Amazon biota [63,64], such as species-rich
Neotropical lowland clades [65] including the more typically Amazon-
centred, more widely distributed, Annonaceae genus Guatteria [66]. The
strong correlation between phylogenetic patterns and geographic areas found
here resembles more closely the patterns found in Neotropical birds [67].
By looking at the tree topologies presented in Figs. 1 and 2, the split
between the Venezuelan and/or Guianan clades and the
western/Pacific/Central American clades for Cremastosperma do not match
that observed in Mosannona (the splits in the tree topologies are not
spatially congruent). The ages of lineages might be similar, but the
interpretation of such incongruence is not clearly stated. Please provide
some clarification on this issue, or isn’t relevant? In fact, the
topologies suggest that the two studies of suposedly independent lineages
are not evolutionary parallelisms within Annonaceae.
<U+F0B7> Yes - it is one of the major conclusions of the paper that the
distribution patterns of these two – definitely – independent
lineages in part just look similar but have different origins.
Clearly the message has come across, and it seems that this comment
may result from differing interpretations of the term “parallelism”.
I’m comfortable with ours as it stands, and already in the abstract
it is made explicit: “…suggesting that this element of the similar patterns of disjunct
distributions in the two genera is instead a biogeographic parallelism, with differing origins”.
Figure 3. I believe this figure needs to be improved. For instance, the
vertical lines could be removed, only the vertical shadings indicating the
Miocene and Pleistocene are needed. Also, remove the white within the map
insets (make it transparent), so the maps are not overimposed. A key of
what A1, B1, etc. nodes mean is needed on the figure, so the reader does
not need to read the legend or the corresponding table.
<U+F0B7> Yes - this figure could definitely be improved. We have removed the
vertical lines; framed the maps rather than going for transparent
background – this looks better in our opinion; and added a key plus
modified the legend to add more convenient explanation of the node
labels.
Figure 4. Perhaps a drawing or photograph of a typical Cremastosperma and
Mosannona species would highlight the correlations presented.
<U+F0B7> Definitely! We’ve include a colour plate as a new Fig. 1, as above.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a great addition to the growing body of literature on Northern
South American biogeography. The data is extensive in terms of taxa and
genes and the analyses are all appropriate.
I think it is worth mentioning that low passes in the Cordillera Oriental
between the Merida Andes and Norte de Santander and also adjacent to La
Macarena mean that the Eastern Cordillera may not represent that great a
barrier to some lowland distributed organisms.
<U+F0B7> A reference here would have been useful – we searched but just
couldn’t find anything in the literature that was really pertinent or
which would back up such a statement. Our results by contrast seem to
indicate that there was an effective barrier for these plants.
Interesting the suggestion that different dispersal abilities might account
for different degrees of geographic structure between canopy trees and
understorey ones. What are the distributions of the potential dispersers?
Do they exhibit geographic structure in their distributions or phylogenies?
<U+F0B7> Not much is known about potential dispersers. We added references to
two potentially relevant biogeographic studies of toucans, as there
is an observation for one of the Amazonian species of Mosannona that
the fruits are dispersed by these birds (see above).
The following examples in other families could be contradictory to this
suggestion and therefore should perhaps be cited.

Abstract: Much of the immense present day biological diversity of
Neotropical rainforests originated from the Miocene onwards, a period of
geological and ecological upheaval in South America. We assess the impact
of the Andean orogeny, drainage of lake Pebas, and closure of the Panama
Isthmus on two clades of tropical trees (Cremastosperma, c. 31 spp.; and
Mosannona, c. 14 spp.; both Annonaceae). Phylogenetic inference revealed
similar patterns of geographically restricted clades and molecular dating
showed diversifications in the different areas occurred in parallel, with
timing consistent with Andean vicariance and Central American geodispersal.
Ecological niche modelling approaches show phylogenetically conserved niche
differentiation, particularly within Cremastosperma. Niche similarity and
recent common ancestry of Amazon and Guianan Mosannona species contrasts
with dissimilar niches and more distant ancestry of Amazon, Venezuelan and
Guianan species of Cremastosperma suggesting that this element of the
similar patterns of disjunct distributions in the two genera is instead a
biogeographic parallelism, with differing origins. The results provide
further independent evidence for the importance of the Andean orogeny, the
drainage of Lake Pebas, and the formation of links between South and
Central America in the evolutionary history of Neotropical lowland
rainforest trees.
