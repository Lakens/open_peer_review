In this manuscript the authors study a discoordination game known as Samaritan's dilemma in
cellular automata (CA) form. They consider a quantum version of the spatial formulation of the
game (i.e., similar to an iterated setting) by considering varying degrees of entanglement, in the
presence of quantum noise, and in unfair settings (while one player use quantum strategies the
other is restricted to classical strategies). They find that under fair conditions (i.e., both players
use quantum strategies), the CA allows the emergence of a Nash Equilibrium (NE) when the
shared entanglement is high. An interesting finding in this study is that the Beneficiary player
always receive higher payoff even in the case when the Charity player has access to quantum
strategies while the Beneficiary player is restricted to classical strategies.
I find the attempts to investigate games from the classical game theory within the framework of
quantum mechanics (i.e., introducing entanglement, quantum strategies, unfair/biased strategies,
CA) to be very interesting. Thus i believe that this manuscript deserves publication in some form
as the authors have carried out a very detailed study to clarify the evolution of payoffs of the
players in many different settings. However, the authors should address the following issues in a
revised manuscript to warranty publication:
1. The figures could be given in a better form. The captions of most of the figures do not include
the explanations of the symbols in the figures. For example, \mu in Fig. 2, \alpha in Fig 3. Also in
all figures there are some abbreviations and numbers listed above the plots, such as -QSG(3,2;-
1,3;-1,1)-CA T=200 N=200 µ= 0.5. I suggest that either the authors remove those from the plots or
explain clearly what they stand for. I recommend they remove those, and write that information
in the captions and improve the quality of their figures and plots.
2. In Fig. 9, what do \theta, \alpha and p stand for?
3. In such a manuscript in which effects of entanglement and noises on a game are studied within
an evolutionary (or iterated) form, one would like to see the pioneering works from Johnson and
Imoto groups on similar topics. For example, i believe the following works should be cited in the
proper places within the text. [Phys Rev A 67, 022311 (2003); Phys. Lett. A 328, 20-25 (2004); New

label_comment_2
The authors study a two-dimensional cellular automaton of agents playing the Samaritan's
Dilemma. Alonso-Sans has made a small industry of studying examples of such cellular automata
(CA) - they might be called semi-quantum CA since the local interactions are quantum (using the
well known protocol for two-player games of Eisert et al.) but the updating each generation is
classical.
As one of the longer time researcher in quantum games it often falls upon me to review papers in
the field and I have reviewed earlier works in this series. As I have noted before, there are
intrinsic problems with the two-parameter strategy space (see Flitney and Hollenberg, Phys. Lett.
A 363 (2007) 381 and Benjamin and Hayden, Phys. Rev. Lett. 87 (2001) 069801) which I have never
seen satisfactorily answered. The justification seems to be mainly historical - Eisert used it so we
can too. However, in the seventeen years since Eisert et al. published their paper I hope that we
have learnt something and progressed the field of quantum games.
In the current game, if one were to use an alternate two-parameter strategy space obtained by
setting alpha = 0 in Eq. (4.1) then a Nash equilibrium (NE) is obtained when both players choose
the strategy theta = pi, beta = pi/4 (yielding the same payoffs as the {Q,Q} NE with the strategy
space of Eq. (1.4)). However, the equilibrium only holds for maximum entanglement (gamma =
pi/2). I have not looked to see what new equilibria may arise for gamma < pi/2 but there will
exist some NE, either in pure or mixed quantum strategies. I expect that, for gamma = pi/2, any
non-zero noise would also disrupt the NE. The point that I am making is that the NE payoffs and
the behaviour of the NE as the entanglement is reduced or noise is applied is intrinsically linked
to the particular strategy space chosen. With no physical (or mathematical) reason for chosing
one strategy space over the other (or some alternative two-parameter space) the results mean
little.
However, the paper has some interesting and publishable results for the full set of three-
parameter strategies and I would urge the authors to concentrate on these alone. Both the
quantum-quantum and unfair quantum-classical setups are of interest in this case and give
clearly different results than the purely classical game.
Apart from this general observation I have a number of minor corrections/queries:
1) p2, line 55. The strategies C and D indicate 'cooperation' and 'defection' in Prisoners' Dilemma
but need to be defined in the context of Samaritan's Dilemma.
2) p5 line 14: should explain that adjacent here means orthogonally adjacent, i.e. only A-B or B-A
interactions.
3) p5 line 17: by 'mate player' I presume you mean the player with same role, i.e. charity or
benificiary
4) p12 lines 19 and 21: 'in what respect the player A' should be 'in respect of player A'
5) p12 line 53: 'in what respect to' -> 'in respect of'
6) Second part of Fig 12 (and similarly Fig 13) should be split into separate graphs for the
different parameters (theta, alpha, beta) or at least different colors should be used for each
parameter. As it stands it is almost impossible to tell the lines apart.
7) p14 line 48: the first alpha_A should be alpha_B
4
In conclusion, the authors need to concentrate on the three-parameter results since these are the
only results that are meaningful. If they do this, and make the small corrections I have listed, the
paper has both interesting and mathematically justifiable results and would be suitable for
publication. However, I find little justification for inclusion of the two-parameter results.

This paper describes a quantum mechanical analog to the Samaritan’s dilemma in which the
players make use of (potentially) entangled quantum mechanical resources. The update rule for
the player’s strategies is a classical and spatial one, with each player changing their strategy
based on the most successful strategies of their neighbors. In this context, the authors observe the
emergence of strategies close to the Nash equilibrium.
The most interesting part of the paper is certainly where a three parameter strategy (ie. full
control) of a single qubit is analyzed, rather than the artificially limited two parameter strategy.
Although there was a paragraph justifying the two-parameter approach, it would be good to see
more emphasis on the three parameter section in comparison to the more limited two-parameter
approach.
It would be useful to expand operations in terms of Pauli operators and rotations. Eg. Y instead of
‘D', and to express the single qubit strategies, U, in terms of rotations. This would make the
effects of each gate more readily understandable.
One question: There are several different operators which correspond to the same strategy. The
operator D=iY commutes with the entanglement operator and so is a natural choice. However the
operator Q=iZ does not commute, and so only when both parties choose Q does it ensure that QQ
is chosen. Why was the identity not chosen? It might be more instructive to talk about these
“classical” strategies first, and the effect of choosing non-commuting (with the entangling
operation) strategies as a more general quantum variation.
A significant problem in accessing the accompanying data is that the link to the Dryad digital
repository appears to be broken.
Also, one small typo:

egrees of entanglement, in the presence of quantum noise, and in unfair settings
while one player use quantum strategies the other is restricted to classical
trategies). They find that under fair conditions (i.e., both players use quantum
trategies), the CA allows the emergence of a Nash Equilibrium (NE) when the shared
ntanglement is high. An interesting finding in this study is that the Beneficiary
layer always receive higher payoff even in the case when the Charity player has
ccess to quantum strategies while the Beneficiary player is restricted to classical
trategies.
find the attempts to investigate games from the classical game theory within the
ramework of quantum mechanics (i.e., introducing entanglement, quantum strategies,
nfair/biased strategies, CA) to be very interesting. Thus i believe that this
anuscript deserves publication in some form as the authors have carried out a very
etailed study to clarify the evolution of payoffs of the players in many different
ettings. However, the authors should address the following issues in a revised
anuscript to warranty publication:
. The figures could be given in a better form. The captions of most of the
igures do not include the explanations of the symbols in the figures. For
xample, \mu in Fig.2, \alpha in Fig 3. Also in all figures there are some
bbreviations and numbers listed above the plots, such as -QSG(3,2;-1,3;-
,1)-CA T=200 N=200 ?= 0.5. I suggest that either the authors remove those
rom the plots or explain clearly what they stand for. I recommend they
emove those, and write that information in the captions and improve the
uality of their figures and plots.
> We have improved the captions of the figures in the way above
ndicated. But we decided not to eliminate the top-labels, as we
onsider them to be a double source of contextualization
f the graphics. Alternative to that of the caption we mean. We
ave simplified the top-labels by presenting just one of them,
ommon to both the left and right frames (see for example
ig.3). Anyway, we are open to eliminate the top-labels in the
igures if the referee and/or the editor and/or the production
eam maintain the judgement against them.
. In Fig. 9, what do \theta, \alpha and p stand for?
> The captions of this figure (current Fig.10) and that of Fig.16 have
een upgraded in order to clarify this point.
. In such a manuscript in which effects of entanglement and noises on a game are
tudied within an evolutionary (or iterated) form, one would like to see the
ioneering works from Johnson and Imoto groups on similar topics. For example, i
elieve the following works should be cited in the proper places within the text.

.S.- Please note that we have added the new current Fig.12, in
he revised version of the manuscript, dealing with an

he authors study a two-dimensional cellular automaton of agents playing the
amaritan's Dilemma. Alonso-Sans has made a small industry of studying examples
f such cellular automata (CA) - they might be called semi-quantum CA since the
ocal interactions are quantum (using the well known protocol for two-player
ames of Eisert et al.) but the updating each generation is classical. As one of
he longer time researcher in quantum games it often falls upon me to review
apers in the field and I have reviewed earlier works in this series. As I have
oted before, there are intrinsic problems with the two-parameter strategy space
see Flitney and Hollenberg, Phys.Lett. A 363 (2007) 381 and Benjamin and Hayden,
hys.Rev.Lett. 87(2001)069801) which I have never seen satisfactorily answered.
he justification seems to be mainly historical - Eisert used it so we can too.
owever, in the seventeen years since Eisert et al. published their paper I hope
hat we have learnt something and progressed the field of quantum games.
n the current game, if one were to use an alternate two-parameter strategy space
btained by setting alpha = 0 in Eq. (4.1) then a Nash equilibrium (NE) is
btained when both players choose the strategy theta = pi, beta = pi/4 (yielding
he same payoffs as the {Q,Q} NE with the strategy space of Eq. (1.4)). However,
he equilibrium only holds for maximum entanglement (gamma = pi/2). I have not
ooked to see what new equilibria may arise for gamma < pi/2 but there will exist
ome NE, either in pure or mixed quantum strategies. I expect that, for gamma =
i/2, any non-zero noise would also disrupt the NE. The point that I am making is
hat the NE payoffs and the behaviour of the NE as the entanglement is reduced or
oise is applied is intrinsically linked to the particular strategy space chosen.
ith no physical (or mathematical) reason for chosing one strategy space over the
ther(or some alternative two-parameter space) the results mean little.
owever, the paper has some interesting and publishable results for the full set
f three-parameter strategies and I would urge the authors to concentrate on
hese alone. Both the quantum-quantum and unfair quantum-classical setups are of
nterest in this case and give clearly different results than the purely
lassical game.

ince these are the only results that are meaningful. If they do this, and
ake the small corrections I have listed, the paper has both interesting and
athematically justifiable results and would be suitable for publication.
owever, I find little justification for inclusion of the two-parameter
esults.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper describes a quantum mechanical analog to the Samaritan’s dilemma in which the
players make use of (potentially) entangled quantum mechanical resources. The update
rule for the player’s strategies is a classical and spatial one, with each player
changing their strategy based on the most successful strategies of their neighbors. In
this context, the authors observe the emergence of strategies close to the Nash
equilibrium.
* The most interesting part of the paper is certainly where a three parameter
strategy (ie. full control) of a single qubit is analyzed, rather than the
artificially limited two parameter strategy. Although there was a paragraph
justifying the two-parameter approach, it would be good to see more emphasis
on the three parameter section in comparison to the more limited two-parameter
approach.
>> We add a warning regarding this issue at the end of the first
paragraph of the final conclusions section.
* It would be useful to expand operations in terms of Pauli operators and
rotations. Eg. Y instead of ‘D', and to express the single qubit strategies,
U, in terms of rotations. This would make the effects of each gate more
readily understandable.
>> Due to the context of the paper, we prefer to maintain the, let us
say, standard notation (in quantum games, we mean) for the single
qubit strategies. In our opinion, for example, “D”, associated with
the Defection choice (either no aid, or loaf in the SD), is preferable
to iY.
* One question: There are several different operators which correspond to the
same strategy. The operator D=iY commutes with the entanglement operator and
so is a natural choice. However the operator Q=iZ does not commute, and so
only when both parties choose Q does it ensure that QQ is chosen. Why was the
identity not chosen? It might be more instructive to talk about these
“classical” strategies first, and the effect of choosing non-commuting (with
the entangling operation) strategies as a more general quantum variation.
>> According to this suggestion, we have improved the explanation
regarding the role of the classical strategies in the first paragraph
of the subsection 1.(b), i.e., when introducing the (EWL) quantum
approach in game theory. With an explicit reference to the identity
I=C. But in agreement with our above opinion, we prefer to
maintain Q to refer to the Quantum strategy instead of iZ.
* A significant problem in accessing the accompanying data is that the link to
the Dryad digital repository appears to be broken.
>> If the problem persists, we will do our best to solve it.
Also, one small typo:
* P17: H.S. proposed the Samaritan’s dilemma as the interesting -> H.S.
proposed the Samaritan’s dilemma as an interesting.
>> Corrected
