This study presents evidence of social segregation based on acoustic clans in the Atlantic Ocean.
While this has previously been shown in the Pacific, the current manuscript identifies a similar
pattern in the Atlantic leading the authors to suggest that cultural identity at the clan level is
important for this species worldwide. This is a very nice piece of research; it is well written and
clearly presented with only a few minor grammatical and spelling errors. My single major
comment is that I would like the authors to acknowledge more fully the smaller sample size to
find these results, and the potential outcomes of more data (see below). Overall, the manuscript
should be accepted with a few minor changes outlined below.
Specific comments to address include:

This is an excellent paper, which I thoroughly enjoyed reading. It describes previous research
findings concisely, and builds on this work to represent an important contribution to our
understanding of culturally-determined behavior and population structure in sperm whales, and
animal social structure in general. The paper is well written and the text is supported by two very
informative figures. There are two areas, however, that I think deserve more discussion or
clarification:
The authors do a great job of describing the social and acoustic segregation of the clans, but I
would like to see more observations relating to ecological or behavioral distinctiveness. For
example, these two clans appear to use the area to very different extents, so I wonder if there is
any evidence that they are using it for different purposes (e.g. EC1 for core feeding area and
social interactions; EC2 possibly only feeding?). Details of behavioral observations, even just
summary details, could help inform this. Also, I think it would help to give information on the
relative group sizes (although these can be read from Fig 2) and also the group composition – I
had assumed all were females with dependent offspring until the mention of a male that
associated with both clans. The discussion lines 257-263 introduce the idea of behavioral
heterogeneity, so it would strengthen this point if there were some data on this introduced in the
results.
The discovery curves (Figure S2) do not support asymptotic discovery of codas. I think this
merits more discussion as to whether differences could be, at least partly, a result of limited
sampling. It seems that the limited opportunities to encounter the rare units would at least
introduce uncertainty into inference about structure from photo-id associations and measures of
acoustic similarities. I think this should be further discussed, and in my mind this should involve
some consideration about statistical inference in the face of small sample sizes.
Minor comments
Line 30. Tt is true that this variation may be “driven by genetic distinctiveness”, but is it not also
possible that it may result in genetic distinctiveness?

Line 52. Spelling “behaivourally”.
Line 63. Remove “a” before cultural.
Lines 69-71. This is a bit confusing. I assume you mean that “Units from different clans used the
same waters, but tended to appear in temporal waves, associating with other units of their own
clan”, rather than the temporal waves representing successive waves of units from the same clan?
Line 74. “from 29 total social units”
Line 85. I think it is fine to refer back to a previous publication for the details of how unit
membership was defined, but given the comment (above) about sampling, I think it is important
here to include some details about how you dealt with uncertainty about social unit composition
(relative to Fig 2 also).
Line 141. “Photographically-derived associations” or some way of clarifying that these were
defined for the photo-id work.
Line 161. See major comment above. The discovery curves don’t show asymptotic discovery of
codas, and as such I am not sure this supports the strong statement “ repertoires of all units were
well categorized”
Line 206. Suggest “from samples spanning more than a few months…”, or equivalent.
Table 1 header. This needs to be expanded to ensure that it stands alone from the text. For
example, ICI needs defining, and I think a reference to OPTICS would be appropriate. Also a bit
more explanation would help, following the more detailed and informative Figure legends (e.g.
“Mean coda repertoire similarities within and between sperm whale units recorded of Dominica
compared using…”).

main comment raised, which was also emphasised by Dr. Durban (Reviewer 2), was that sample size

hy the results would likely would not change with additional sampling; as well as, added a

Durban found that this was an excellent paper, and felt it was an important contribution to our

two main comments focused on sample size as Dr. Garland also pointed out, and a desire for more
ussion about behavioural and ecological differences between clans. We have addressed the former
ve and deal with the later below.
grateful to Dr. Durban for a helpful review and hope he feels the paper has been improved by his
ments.
cific Comments:
authors do a great job of describing the social and acoustic segregation of the clans, but I would like
ee more observations relating to ecological or behavioral distinctiveness. For example, these two

know from the Pacific that clans differ across a number of behaviours. We are limited in our
erstanding of behavioural differences between the Caribbean clans to date. Now that we have
tified their existence this kind of study could be possible. However, we feel that this is an entirely
erent analysis which stands on its own. While the two clans use the habitat off Dominica at different
es (in temporal waves as we describe in text), we have weak evidence that the EC2 clan may use
ers farther offshore but our analysis is in progress. From a behavioural state perspective, the vast
ority of time sperm whales off Dominica are foraging and this appears to be the case for both clans.
differs from the Pacific when social periods are predictably in the afternoons. We have not yet
lysed diet between the two clans. Movement patterns may differ and satellite telemetry could help
idate this, and to that extent, Dr Durban is a world expert and a potential collaboration in this regard
ld prove fruitful. As such, we really have only begun to look at ecological or behavioural differences,
we agree with the reviewer that is a critical next step.
or group size, to be clear, the units only include adult females and their offspring. We plotted the
work including mature male consorts in order to highlight that the only social connection between
s is when a male consorts with both clans (which in and of itself is an interesting finding). The details
he group composition can be found in the referenced paper in connection with average unit and
up size, cluster sizes, residency times for the study site.
discovery curves (Figure S2) do not support asymptotic discovery of codas. I think this merits more
ussion as to whether differences could be, at least partly, a result of limited sampling. It seems that
limited opportunities to encounter the rare units would at least introduce uncertainty into inference
ut structure from photo-id associations and measures of acoustic similarities. I think this should be
her discussed, and in my mind this should involve some consideration about statistical inference in
face of small sample sizes.
se see main reply to this point above in our reply to Dr. Garland.
or comments
30. It is true that this variation may be “driven by genetic distinctiveness”, but is it not also possible
t it may result in genetic distinctiveness?
true that long term isolation can cause both behavioural variation such as geographic variation in
g, as well as genetic distinctiveness between two isolated communities. In addition, behavioural
ation if perceived as significant could reduce the likelihood of mating and create genetic distinctions
ween the two communities. However, our point here is really just to suggest that geographic
ation in vocal repertoires could be the result of genetics, or, alternatively, social learning and culture.

and we have reworded as suggested.
74. “from 29 total social units”
his case 29 is actually the reference number. We were not sure about the formatting and order or
ckets when the reference was within a bracketed phrase. We will defer to the editorial office and the
esetters here, but have made it such that the reference is now enclosed in square brackets [ ], as
matting requires, but the phrase is within parentheses ( ).
85. I think it is fine to refer back to a previous publication for the details of how unit membership
defined, but given the comment (above) about sampling, I think it is important here to include some
ails about how you dealt with uncertainty about social unit composition (relative to Fig 2 also).
pared with sperm whale social unit membership definitions in previous work, we use a very
servative metric. Whales must be seen within 2 hours to be defined as associated. Whales must be
ociated in sequential years in order to meet unit membership. The multi-year requirement creates a
nario in which we only actually include individuals as members if they have a long term pattern of
ociation with other members. This raises the bar for unit membership definition from previous work in
Pacific. We have included more detail in this section.
