Overall Comments:
This work addresses an important research gap in D. suzukii-fungal interactions, and the
research is valuable and capable of contributing to the field. The manuscript was quite brief and
could benefit from increased detail in the methodology, and better coverage of previous work
and literature. Due to the lack of details on experimental design, e.g. number of experimental
replicates and treatment replicates, it was difficult to evaluate whether analyses and conclusions
were appropriate. The bacterial community work also lacked detail and presentation of some of
the results typical to that type of work (e.g., rarefaction curve). Language needs to be edited for
clarity and grammar throughout.
Specific Comments:
Abstract:
Line 11: Consider revising this sentence for clarity. Also, I am unsure what you mean by “bay
wounds”
Line 15: What is meant by “declared light sour rot symptoms”?
Line 18: I am unfamiliar with the term “bay” please define upon first mention.
Introduction
Line 30: “…” typographical error? I would complete the list or provide a truncated list with the
hosts that experience the most economic damage For example, (e.g., cherries, blueberries,
raspberries) would be more appropriate.
Line 30: I am unsure what you mean by “cultures”.
Line 32: D. suzukii is difficult to control with conventional pesticides for a multitude of reasons.
Short residual efficacy, overlapping generations, rapid reproduction, potential to recolonize the
field also contribute. Field failures due to resistance have not yet been documented. Consider
revising and adding additional citations. For example Van Timmeren and Isaacs 2013, Control of
spotted wing drosophila by specific insecticides and by conventional and organic crop protection
programs, Crop Protection 54:126-133.
Line 35-36: Revise for clarity.
Line 48: Replace “benefit” with “advantage”.
Line 49: Do you mean “berries” instead of “bays”?
Line 54: “Implicated” instead of “implied”
Materials and Methods

Line 72: How did you assign bunches to the “heavy sour rot symptoms” category? E.g., which
disease symptoms were used and how were they rated? What percent of the bunch exhibited
symptoms?
Line 104: What was the source of the D. melanogaster and D. suzukii flies used in the
experimental infections? Were they colony flies? Were they axenic or carrying microbes? How
many replicate exposure experiments were performed? Is it possible the microbes on the fly
population would vary between the replicates?
Line 108: So berries without wounds were chosen? Was the stem attached?
Line 111: It is unclear what the 10% extract is and why you were using it. Is this a homogenized
microbial community that you are adding? Was the same extract used for all replicates? How
many clusters were used to make the extract? Please include much more detail on these extracts.
Line 141: By grey rot do you mean Botrytis cinerea? Was this pathogen present in the extract? Or
latent in the berries?
Line 153: Which type of flies?
Line 159: How many reads per sample? Do you have rarefaction curves?
Discussion
Line 182: Typographical error “(Error! Reference source not found.)”
Line 209: Isn’t cVA produced by Drosophila adults not larvae? Why would you expect that to
impact this assay?

Overall this was a nice study. Very interesting to see how potentially important D. suzukii is for
the transmission of sour rot in a vineyard. Such results may help guide management decisions of
both insects and fruit pathogens for grape growers.
While wording and sentence structure were generally done well throughout the manuscript, I
suggest having someone with English as their first language with a background in science read
over the article again. Have him/her check formatting of sentences for readability and flow. For
example, the sentence starting on line 32. Also, make sure that words properly translate in to
English. Other than that, cicely done. I look forward to reading the polished manuscript!
The following are suggestions and edits that I think will help improve this manuscript.
Abstract
Line 11: I am not familiar with the system, so it may just be my ignorance, but what is a “bay”
wound? When reading the article, “bay” appears to be a miss-translation of “berry”, so either
define “bay” or fix throughout the article.
Line 21: maybe change “hence” to “subsequently”
Introduction
Lines 25-26: maybe change, “...started invading...” to “...initially detected in...”
Line 27: Drosophila “genus”
Line 30: change “cultures” to “crops” or “instances”
Line 31: “solutions”
Line 36: was the 30% loss cited here due to sour rot (mentioned later) or directly due to the
infestation?
Lines 52-53: changing, “...species that can trigger disease development” to “...species associated
with sour rot development.” seems more appropriate.
Line 54: change “implied” to “connected”
Materials and methods
Line 72: What was the design of the cages?
Line 74: change “for” to “to”
Line 75: “the health of bunches”
Line 75: “re-evaluate”
Line 82: “chased” to “collected”
Line 82: Where did you sweep? Within the vineyard? Below the vines? Row middles?
Line 83: 15 total individuals seems really low to do any comparative analyses. Since you do not
compare by distance collected, maybe just remove that portion and just look at total flies collected
Line 90: Try not to start a sentence with a number
Line 116: What is “grey rot”. Probably work describing here or in the introduction since you
present analyzed data about it.
Line 121: I know there isn’t time or money to do everything, but it would have been really
interesting to do this experiment with D. suzukii as well.
Results
Line 159: What is the significance of “2,000 reads” or an average of “13,000 reads”?
5
Discussion
Line 182: Check the error shown in the PDF
Line 190: Please describe what cages were used (commented above) in order to make sure no
contamination could have happened between grape clusters once they were brought into the lab.
That is needed in order to strengthen your statement that your data reveals an association
between sour rot and D. suzukii in the field. Additionally, I would be hesitant to use the word
“causative” here. Sour rot occurred when berries were covered with incoculum and then
subjected to flies. In the lab, the infection of the berries appears to be due to D. suzukii piercing a
hole in the grape, allowing the rot to get inside, but in the field there are many other issues that
may pierce the grape skin allowing rot to enter the berry. Thus, be careful when using
“causative”.
Line 196: Just as a note, the same thing could have happened with the field collected berries.

This is an important paper that details bacterial vectoring in wine grapes.
Some information that is not clear from the paper are the condition of the grapes. The authors
should include information on Brix, acidity, firmness and possibly penetration values for the
grapes studied. This information should provide context of overall conditions where such
vectoring is possible. For instance in the Western USA, grapes are not suitable for oviposition or
development of SWD, due to conditions that are detailed in that paper. Provide more details of
the fruit conditions in this paper to provide such context.
Other than that, the paper should be accepted.

This is an important paper that details bacterial vectoring in wine grapes.
Some information that is not clear from the paper are the condition of the grapes. The authors
should include information on Brix, acidity, firmness and possibly penetration values for the
grapes studied. This information should provide context of overall conditions where such
vectoring is possible. For instance in the Western USA, grapes are not suitable for oviposition or
development of SWD, due to conditions that are detailed in that paper. Provide more details of
the fruit conditions in this paper to provide such context.
Other than that, the paper should be accepted.

Overall the authors have addressed reviewer comments. I believe the manuscript could still
benefit from some language and content editing, especially details about the grape cultivars used
and a consistency in the framing of the structure of the manuscript. While the paper is acceptable
as is, these edits would increase its overall value and readability.
Specific comments:
Abstract
Line 18: Correct spelling: Drosophila
Materials and Methods
Were bunches without sour rot symptoms completely free of wounds? This can be difficult to
determine since fruits are bunched tightly.
What is the typical skin thickness of the varieties you used in this study? Previous research
indicates a physiological limit to D. suzukii’s ability to penetrate fruit skin and it would be
valuable to know, particularly for the Red Muscat used in the laboratory experiments.
Results
Line 193: Check spelling, I believe it is Gluconobacter
Line 200: italicize D. suzukii
Discussion
Line 210: italicize D. suzukii
Line 226: What do you mean by systematic?
Line 227: Could also be due to minor cracks and tearing of grape skin that can also be difficult to
detect.
Line 246: This conjecture should be qualified perhaps “could” instead of “would”, as you did not
include preference tests with sour rot vs. sour rot+ D. suzukii larvae to determine whether D.
melanogaster would find both types of fruit equally attractive.
Line 256: This framework of the impact of an invader on an ecosystem was somewhat developed
in the abstract, but was not introduced in the introduction. The structure of this manuscript
would be improved by including an opening paragraph in the introduction that focuses on the
impact of invasive species on native ecosystems.
Tables
Table 1: It seems OTU (Operational Taxonomic Unit) would be more appropriate than “Number
of genera” since some of the families are broken down to a genus level which suggests that the
“Number of genera” column would then refer to the “Number of species” at that level. E.g.,
Gluconobacter spp has 3 “Number of genera”.
Table S2: See comments for Table 1.
11
Figures
Figure 3: There are dark marks at 100 on either end of the x-axis, what do they represent?
Figure 4: Isn’t a 3rd sour rot aetiology scenario possible where D. suzukii are secondary pests that
are either attracted to or initiate sour rot after wounds? Unless you are sure the clusters collected
in the field had no external wounds prior to D. suzukii that is still a possible scenario, especially
for thicker skinned grape varieties. For instance, in the US, grape berry moth (early season pest)
frass is commonly found in sour rot grapes with Drosophila larvae. Perhaps the moth brings in
the sour rot microbes that attracts the Drosophila or perhaps the wound attracts Drosophila
carrying sour rot microbes.

Comments to the Author(s)
Overall Comments:
This work addresses an important research gap in D. suzukii-fungal interactions, and the research is
valuable and capable of contributing to the field. The manuscript was quite brief and could benefit from
increased detail in the methodology, and better coverage of previous work and literature. Due to the
lack of details on experimental design, e.g. number of experimental replicates and treatment replicates,
it was difficult to evaluate whether analyses and conclusions were appropriate. The bacterial community
work also lacked detail and presentation of some of the results typical to that type of work (e.g.,
rarefaction curve). Language needs to be edited for clarity and grammar throughout.
-----> Thank you for the positive comment and spotting the (numerous) missing details in the methods.
We apologize for insufficient language editing prior to submission. The manuscript has been reviewed by
several colleagues who are native English speakers. We have thoroughly revised the manuscript for
clarity and in response to referees’ comments.
Specific Comments:
Abstract:
Line 16: Consider revising this sentence for clarity. Also, I am unsure what you mean by “bay wounds”
-----> The sentence has been revised. The term “bay” was mistakenly used for “berry” here and in
several other instances in the MS. In French “baie” which means both “bay” and “berry”.
Line 19: What is meant by “declared light sour rot symptoms”?
-----> This sentence has been revised for clarity.
Line 18: I am unfamiliar with the term “bay” please define upon first mention.
-----> See above. “Bay” has been replaced by “berry”
Introduction
Line 33-35: “…” typographical error? I would complete the list or provide a truncated list with the hosts
that experience the most economic damage For example, (e.g., cherries, blueberries, raspberries) would
be more appropriate.
-----> Sentence has been changed accordingly.
Line 35: I am unsure what you mean by “cultures”.
-----> Sentence has been profoundly revised. Intended meaning was “crops”.
Line 35-39: D. suzukii is difficult to control with conventional pesticides for a multitude of reasons. Short
residual efficacy, overlapping generations, rapid reproduction, potential to recolonize the field also
contribute. Field failures due to resistance have not yet been documented. Consider revising and adding
additional citations. For example Van Timmeren and Isaacs 2013, Control of spotted wing drosophila by
specific insecticides and by conventional and organic crop protection programs, Crop Protection 54:126-
133.
-----> Following these suggestions, we now discuss with more details the challenges associated with
controlling D. suzukii damages. We also removed mentions about resistance appearance, even though
unpublished data has revealed pesticide loss of efficiency in North America on D. suzukii.
Line 40-45: Revise for clarity.
-----> The whole paragraph has been revised
Line 54: Replace “benefit” with “advantage”.
-----> The sentence was changed
Line 54: Do you mean “berries” instead of “bays”?
-----> Yes, see above
Line 59: “Implicated” instead of “implied”
-----> We changed the whole sentence
Materials and Methods
Line 78: How did you assign bunches to the “heavy sour rot symptoms” category? E.g., which disease
symptoms were used and how were they rated? What percent of the bunch exhibited symptoms?
-----> As now described in the text, bunches from the “heavy sour rot” (now called “severe sour rot”)
category exhibited the traditional sour rot symptoms (smell and colour), at least half of their grapes had
visible rot.
Line 114: What was the source of the D. melanogaster and D. suzukii flies used in the experimental
infections? Were they colony flies? Were they axenic or carrying microbes? How many replicate exposure
experiments were performed? Is it possible the microbes on the fly population would vary between the
replicates?
-----> As now described later in the text (l. 128-132), all flies were reared in non-sterile, standard lab
conditions. We now give more details on the origins of the fly populations we used and the medium we
used for rearing in the supplementary materials
Line 118-120: So berries without wounds were chosen? Was the stem attached?
-----> Yes, we paid great attention to only use pristine berries for the experiment. Stems were still
strongly attached and skin undamaged. We now give more details about this aspect of the protocol in
the manuscript.
Line 121-125: It is unclear what the 10% extract is and why you were using it. Is this a homogenized
microbial community that you are adding? Was the same extract used for all replicates? How many
clusters were used to make the extract? Please include much more detail on these extracts.
-----> It is basically crushed infected bunches. We use 4 different bunches to obtain 4 individual
extracts, which were taken in account during the experiment (and had no effect). Following these
suggestions, we now describe methods with more details.
Line 136-140: By grey rot do you mean Botrytis cinerea? Was this pathogen present in the extract? Or
latent in the berries?
-----> Yes, it was indeed Botrytis cinerea. As now detailed in the manuscript, the fungus apparently was
present in 2 of the 4 sour rot extracts we used.
Line 175: Which type of flies?
-----> We added species name for clarity.
Line 185-187: How many reads per sample? Do you have rarefaction curves?
-----> We retrieved an average of 13,000 reads per sample. Rarefaction curves are now available in the
supplementary material, figure S1. Importantly, all sample curves reached a plateau, suggesting
sequencing depth was sufficient. These elements are now in the manuscript.
Discussion
Line 212: Typographical error “(Error! Reference source not found.)”
-----> Last minute MS Word induced error. Now corrected, thanks.
Line 241: Isn’t cVA produced by Drosophila adults not larvae? Why would you expect that to impact this
assay?
-----> Yes, cVA is only produced by adults, and mainly by males. We removed this element from the
discussion.
Tables and Figures
Figure 1: How were the flies summed and averaged? Across bunches, across grapes within a bunch?
What is the n value?
-----> These are now in figure legend.
Table 1: Only 5 genera of bacteria were found? What were the total number of sequences per sample?
-----> We completely reworked the table in response to comments by Referee 2 (no more distance
classes). Note that table values, but not conclusions, have slightly changed during revision as we
updated read number threshold for OTU presence. Also, a complete list of the genera found is available

Comments to the Author(s)
Overall this was a nice study. Very interesting to see how potentially important D. suzukii is for the
transmission of sour rot in a vineyard. Such results may help guide management decisions of both
insects and fruit pathogens for grape growers.
While wording and sentence structure were generally done well throughout the manuscript, I suggest
having someone with English as their first language with a background in science read over the article
again. Have him/her check formatting of sentences for readability and flow. For example, the sentence
starting on line 32. Also, make sure that words properly translate in to English. Other than that, cicely
done. I look forward to reading the polished manuscript!
-----> Thank you for the encouraging comments. We entirely revised the manuscript to improve
language and provide missing details.
The following are suggestions and edits that I think will help improve this manuscript.
Abstract
Line 16: I am not familiar with the system, so it may just be my ignorance, but what is a “bay” wound?
When reading the article, “bay” appears to be a miss-translation of “berry”, so either define “bay” or fix
throughout the article.
-----> Yes, we indeed confused bay and berry. The mistake was corrected thorough.
Line 25: maybe change “hence” to “subsequently”
-----> Done
Introduction
Lines 3: maybe change, “...started invading...” to “...initially detected in...”
-----> Done
Line 27: Drosophila “genus”
-----> Done.
Line 35: change “cultures” to “crops” or “instances”
-----> Done, that was another translation mistake, thank you.
Line 35: “solutions”
-----> Done
Line 41: was the 30% loss cited here due to sour rot (mentioned later) or directly due to the
infestation?
-----> The loss was due to sour rot. The aim of our study is to understand the role of D. suzukii in sour
rot aetiology, and therefore indirectly in yield losses. This section of the manuscript has been entirely
revised.
Lines 56-58: changing, “...species that can trigger disease development” to “...species associated with
sour rot development.” seems more appropriate.
-----> We changed the whole sentence for clarity.
Line 59: change “implied” to “connected”
-----> This section has been entirely revised.
Materials and methods
Line 79: What was the design of the cages?
-----> Cage design is now described in the text.
Line 81: change “for” to “to”
Line 82: “the health of bunches”
Line 82: “re-evaluate”
Line 91: “chased” to “collected”
-----> Thank you for these corrections, that we all considered.
-----> As now described in the manuscript, we swept in and between rows. Besides, we change the
wording “site” to “vineyard” to avoid confusion.
Line 92: 15 total individuals seems really low to do any comparative analyses. Since you do not compare
by distance collected, maybe just remove that portion and just look at total flies collected
-----> Absolutely, we reworked the table, removed distance classes and added proportions of reads and
number of genera found for each bacterial family.
Line 98: Try not to start a sentence with a number
-----> This section has been modified accordingly.
Line 136-140: What is “grey rot”. Probably work describing here or in the introduction since you present
analyzed data about it.
-----> Grey rot, Botrytis cinerea, is a pathogenic fungus that attacks a large variety of fruits including
grapes. We now give more details about this rot in the methods. There was little to discuss about it as B.
cinerea development appeared independent from our experimental treatments and sour rot.
Line 142: I know there isn’t time or money to do everything, but it would have been really interesting to
do this experiment with D. suzukii as well.
-----> Absolutely! In fact, D. suzukii oviposition behaviour is the topic of current work in our lab.
Results
Line 185-187: What is the significance of “2,000 reads” or an average of “13,000 reads”?
-----> We added more details about this part in methods.
Discussion
Line 215: Check the error shown in the PDF
-----> We corrected this MS Word bug.
Line 222: Please describe what cages were used (commented above) in order to make sure no
contamination could have happened between grape clusters once they were brought into the lab. That is
needed in order to strengthen your statement that your data reveals an association between sour rot
and D. suzukii in the field.
-----> Details on cages are now in the manuscript. Each bunch was placed individually in a cage. Cross-
contamination is therefore unlikely.
Additionally, I would be hesitant to use the word “causative” here. Sour rot occurred when berries were
covered with incoculum and then subjected to flies. In the lab, the infection of the berries appears to be
due to D. suzukii piercing a hole in the grape, allowing the rot to get inside, but in the field there are
many other issues that may pierce the grape skin allowing rot to enter the berry. Thus, be careful when
using “causative”.
-----> For the use of the word “causative” might have been misunderstood by the word “confirmed” in
the sentence: we didn’t mean that 2014 damages were caused by the association we highlight between
sour rot and D. suzukii (we will never know), but for the bunches we collected in this D. suzukii seems
clearly at the origin of the sour rot, that’s the reason we associated field study with the experimental
work in lab. We changed the sentence to reflect this point of view and added Barata et al., 2012 paper,
who found acetic acid bacteria and yeasts associated with sour rot on sound grapes (similar to our
experimental infections).
Line 226: Just as a note, the same thing could have happened with the field collected berries.
-----> This is true indeed. Our conclusions are based on statistical analyses that take into account the
probabilities of such events.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is an important paper that details bacterial vectoring in wine grapes.
Some information that is not clear from the paper are the condition of the grapes. The authors should
include information on Brix, acidity, firmness and possibly penetration values for the grapes studied.
This information should provide context of overall conditions where such vectoring is possible. For
conditions that are detailed in that paper. Provide more details of the fruit conditions in this paper to
provide such context.
Other than that, the paper should be accepted.
-----> Thank you for the suggestion. We agree that factors such as brix, acidity, firmness and
penetration values, that all depend on climate and grape cultivar, influence D. suzukii biology (Ioratti et
al. 2015) and, consequently, that of sour rot. The present study focused on whether or not D. suzukii
can trigger sour rot onset. Further studies will elucidate the variability of this process. We are aware of a
current project led by French and German colleagues that will specific tackle the question.

Comments to the Author(s)
Overall the authors have addressed reviewer comments. I believe the manuscript could still benefit from
some language and content editing, especially details about the grape cultivars used and a consistency
in the framing of the structure of the manuscript. While the paper is acceptable as is, these edits would
increase its overall value and readability.
---> Thank you for this positive decision! We modified the manuscript according to the useful comments
of the referee.
Specific comments:
Abstract
Line 18: Correct spelling: Drosophila
---> Done
Materials and Methods
Were bunches without sour rot symptoms completely free of wounds? This can be difficult to determine
since fruits are bunched tightly.
---> We did not check the bunches for wounds - that would have been technically impossible - and only
account for sour rot symptoms. However during collection bunches considered with “no sour rot” looked
sound. It should be noted that the aim of this experiment was to study the relationship between sour rot
disease and fly presence in the field, infestation mechanisms (e.g. wounds) were studied in the lab
where conditions are better controlled.
What is the typical skin thickness of the varieties you used in this study? Previous research indicates a
physiological limit to D. suzukii’s ability to penetrate fruit skin and it would be valuable to know,
particularly for the Red Muscat used in the laboratory experiments.
---> Unfortunately, we cannot report on skin thickness. Even for a given cultivar the force necessary to
penetrate skin varies with conditions during growth. Note that oviposition by D. suzukii did occur in the
laboratory experiments and adults from this species also emerged from field collections: the species was
therefore able to lay eggs through the skin of the cultivar used.
Results
Line 193: Check spelling, I believe it is Gluconobacter
Line 200: italicize D. suzukii
Discussion
Line 210: italicize D. suzukii
---> Thank you for these corrections, that we all considered.
Line 226: What do you mean by systematic?
---> We replaced this word by “always occurred” for clarity, thank you
Line 227: Could also be due to minor cracks and tearing of grape skin that can also be difficult to
detect.
---> Referee suggests that sour rot could have occurred in the absence of oviposition by D. suzukii
thanks to the presence of skin cracks. However, colleagues (Barata et al. 2012) have previously shown
that the presence of Drosophilids is mandatory to prevent wound healing and therefore disease onset.
Hence, had prior cracks been present, we would have expected sour rot to appear in the treatment with
D. melanogaster females, which did not occur. The referee's hypothesis hence seems unlikely in our
experiment.
Line 246: This conjecture should be qualified perhaps “could” instead of “would”, as you did not include
preference tests with sour rot vs. sour rot+ D. suzukii larvae to determine whether D. melanogaster
would find both types of fruit equally attractive.
---> We made the change as suggested.
Line 256: This framework of the impact of an invader on an ecosystem was somewhat developed in the
abstract, but was not introduced in the introduction. The structure of this manuscript would be improved
by including an opening paragraph in the introduction that focuses on the impact of invasive species on
native ecosystems.
---> We understand why the referee suggests this addition, but we believe this extra paragraph would
most readers will already be aware that biological invasions occur and impact ecosystems. The beginning
of the introduction, before the description of our results, is not the right place to discuss our "slightly
unusual" result that the invader, D. suzukii, has beneficial effects on other species of the invaded area.
Unless the editor whishes we add this introductory paragraph we would rather keep the introduction as
it is.
Tables
Table 1: It seems OTU (Operational Taxonomic Unit) would be more appropriate than “Number of
genera” since some of the families are broken down to a genus level which suggests that the “Number of
genera” column would then refer to the “Number of species” at that level. E.g., Gluconobacter spp has 3
“Number of genera”.
Table S2: See comments for Table 1.
---> We changed the table according to your suggestion
Figures
Figure 3: There are dark marks at 100 on either end of the x-axis, what do they represent?
---> This is a bug, these marks are only present on the PDF produced by the manuscript central. We
have uploaded a high definition version of the figure that does not have this problem.
Figure 4: Isn’t a 3rd sour rot aetiology scenario possible where D. suzukii are secondary pests that are
either attracted to or initiate sour rot after wounds? Unless you are sure the clusters collected in the
field had no external wounds prior to D. suzukii that is still a possible scenario, especially for thicker
skinned grape varieties. For instance, in the US, grape berry moth (early season pest) frass is commonly
found in sour rot grapes with Drosophila larvae. Perhaps the moth brings in the sour rot microbes that
attracts the Drosophila or perhaps the wound attracts Drosophila carrying sour rot microbes.
---> The scenario you are describing seems unlikely for several reasons. First, had wounds been present
before D. suzukii oviposition, we would have expected D. melanogaster to infest the fruit since this
species is known to proliferate as soon as wounds are present. Second, D. suzukii seems to prefer to
oviposit through skin rather than use already accessible fruit flesh on fruits (empirical observation on
cherries, strawberries). Prior wounds would therefore not facilitate D. suzukii colonization and sour rot
onset.
Third, no species other than D. suzukii emerged from the healthy bunches and those that only expressed
sour rot in the lab. The scenario of a third insect species is not supported.
Note that in French vineyards the grape berry moth Paralobesia viteana is not present. The aetiology
could be different in presence of this pest, this would represent an interesting follow-up study.
Kind regards,
