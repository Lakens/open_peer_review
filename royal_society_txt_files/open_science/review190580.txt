Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The authors reported a new function of an interesting compound (PyMDI-Zn). PyMDI-Zn can be
used as the fluorescent dye for detecting proteins. In general, the main findings of their work are
fairly interesting. However, I am afraid that the manuscript is not carefully prepared and
revisions must be needed to improve the work.
The main concern about the manuscript.
As stated in the title and the whole manuscript, PyMDI-Zn can be used as staining and
quantifying proteins. The works for staining proteins is sound. However, the proof for
quantifying proteins is insufficient. The authors provided a calibration curve to show the linearity
of the method, and a result showed that fluorescent intensities of protein-PyMDI-Zn are not
influenced by urea or melamine. These works are necessary, but not enough. At least they should
provide one application of this method for quantifying the protein concentration, to show that the
method they proposed really works well when quantifying proteins. Samples such as milk with
and without urea/melamine might be appropriate. It should be easy to carry out such
experiments since they have already constructed the calibration curve. Traditional method for
quantifying protein concentration may be included as control to prove the accuracy of their
method. Kjeldahl or Dumas methods could be included as well to show that their method is
better.
Other comments
1. the x- or y- axis titles are missing in some of the figures such as fig 1A and 1B
2. fig 1C, the authors studied the influence of proteins, DNA and RNA to the fluorescence. Have
the authors excluded the influence of the sugar/polysaccharides?
3. part 4.1, change “6times” to “6 times”
4. fig 2, the same figures appeared in the supplementary materials (fig S2, S3, S4). Repeated usage
of figures in this paper is not necessary. Moreover, the fig 2B and fig S3 are exactly the same
image, which is not acceptable. Fig S2 and fig S4 provided CBB results for control to fig 2A and
2C. CBB staining is necessary for readers to compare the methods. Therefore, it is suggested that
the fig S2-4 are removed, and CBB images in fig S2 and fig S4 are moved to fig 2.
5. fig 2B, what proteins are used in this SDS-PAGE?
6. the author stated that the proteins bands in SDS-PAGE could be seen under UV with or
without washing step. Thus, it is expected that some images should be provided (at least as
supplementary materials) to support the claim.
7. description about the results in table S1 is not clear to me. The table provided the concentration
of many substances. What are the responses of protein-PyMDI-Zn to each substances at the given
concentration? Any data?
8. there are no descriptions in the method section about how the experiments in part 4.4 are
performed.

Reply to the Comments by Reviewer 1
We greatly appreciate the Reviewer 1 for his/her positive comments: “The authors reported a new
function of an interesting compound (PyMDI-Zn). PyMDI-Zn can be used as the fluorescent dye for
detecting protein. In general, the main finding of their work are fairly interesting.” Meanwhile, we
thank reviewer 1 for the professional suggestions for modification of our manuscript, as well as
his/her careful reading to help us find the errors in our manuscript. We have modified the paper
accordingly, and our point-by-point replies to the questions are as follows:
The main concern about the manuscript
As stated in the title and the whole manuscript, PyMDI-Zn can be used as staining and quantifying proteins. The
works for staining proteins is sound. However, the proof for quantifying proteins is insufficient. The authors provided
a calibration curve to show the linearity of the method, and a result showed that fluorescent intensities of protein-
PyMDI-Zn are not influenced by urea or melamine. These works are necessary, but not enough. At least they should
provide one application of this method for quantifying the protein concentration, to show that the method they
proposed really works well when quantifying proteins. Samples such as milk with and without urea/melamine might
be appropriate. It should be easy to carry out such experiments since they have already constructed the calibration
curve. Traditional method for quantifying protein concentration may be included as control to prove the accuracy
of their method. Kjeldahl or Dumas methods could be included as well to show that their method is better.
Thank the reviewer for his/her professional question. To compare with the existing methods, we
adopted the reviewer’s opinion to use milk as the sample for quantifying the protein concentration.
As shown in Figure S8, we prepare three samples:
sample 1: milk powder (labeled with a protein concentration of 18% by the producer);
sample 2: milk powder with melamine to make the protein concentration up to 35% (calculated by
nitrogen %);
sample 3: milk powder with urea to make the protein concentration up to 30% (calculated by
nitrogen %).
We establish standard curves of quantitative methods of Pierce and PyMDI-Zn using BSA as a
standard protein. The Kjeldahl method is a means of determining the nitrogen content of organic
and inorganic substances, and the nitrogen content of the protein usually accounts for about 16% of
its total mass. Therefore, the total protein content of the sample can be calculated by measuring the
nitrogen content of the sample (assume that the nitrogen is all from the protein). And the quantitative
results of three milk sample with different methods were illustrated Figures S8 as follows:
Figure S8
These data implied that the Kjeldahl method is likely to be applied by the producer of our milk
sample. But this method was easily interfered by nitrogen-rich compounds such as melamine and
urea. PyMDI-Zn and Pierce Kit both provided a stable data which was not interfered by melamine
and urea. Moreover, the protein concentration measured by PyMDI-Zn is closer to that of the
Kjeldahl method than Pierce Kit.
Question 1.
The x- or y- axis titles are missing in some of the figures such as fig 1A and 1B.
We have added x- or y-axis titles to Figure 1A and Figure 1B accordingly.
Question 2.
Fig 1C, the authors studied the influence of proteins, DNA and RNA to the fluorescence. Have the authors excluded
the influence of the sugar/polysaccharides?
Thank the reviewer for his/her professional suggestion, and we have added the data of Glucose,
Glycogen, and Starch into Figure 1C. There were no significant impacts to the fluorescence of
protein-PyMDI-Zn by those substrates, showing the high specificity of PyMDI-Zn probe to protein.
Figure 1C
Question 3.
part 4.1, change “6times” to “6 times”.
Thank the reviewer for his/her helpful suggestions. We have changed “6times” to “6 times” in part
4.1 accordingly.
Question 4.
fig 2, the same figures appeared in the supplementary materials (fig S2, S3, S4). Repeated usage of figures in this
paper is not necessary. Moreover, the fig 2B and fig S3 are exactly the same image, which is not acceptable. Fig S2
and fig S4 provided CBB results for control to fig 2A and 2C. CBB staining is necessary for readers to compare the
methods. Therefore, it is suggested that the fig S2-4 is removed, and CBB images in fig S2 and fig S4 are moved to
fig 2.
We have removed the Figure S2-4 in the supplementary materials, and added the CBB images in
Figure S2 and Figure S4 to Figure 2 according to the suggestion of reviewer 1, which is shown as
follows.
Figure 2
Question 5.
fig 2B, what proteins are used in this SDS-PAGE.
Thank the reviewer for the careful reading. Protein samples were commercial protein markers
that contain proteins of 80 kDa (100 ng/µl), 60 kDa (100 ng/µl), 40 kDa (200 ng/µl). 30 kDa (100
ng/µl), and 20 kDa (100 ng/µl). This information also has been added to the figure caption of Figure
2B.
Question 6.
the author stated that the proteins bands in SDS-PAGE could be seen under UV with or without washing step. Thus,
it is expected that some images should be provided (at least as supplementary materials) to support the claim.
Thank the reviewer for the professional comment. As shown in the following Figure S2, almost
the same gel-staining result was obtained with or without washing step. Therefore, all SDS-PAGE
gels stained by PyMDI-Zn in our manuscript did not go through the washing step. And according
to the suggestion of the reviewer, the results of experiments in Figure S2 were added into
supplementary materials.
Figure S2
Question 7.
In Description about the results in table S1 is not clear to me. The table provided the concentration of many
substances. What are the responses of protein-PyMDI-Zn to each substance at the given concentration? Any data?
Thank the reviewer for this professional question. The responses of protein-PyMDI-Zn to various
substances were tested to investigate their interference to the protein assay (J. AM. CHEM. SOC.
2005, 127, 17799-17802). These reactions were carried out in the solution with 100 µM BSA as
well as 200 µM PyMDI-Zn in presence of a different concentration of foreign substances. The
fluorescence was detected at 520nm with excitation at 486 nm by Thermo Scientific Varioskan Flash.
The maximum concentrations that give the perturbation of fluorescence intensity less than 10% can
be obtained. We use glucose as an example to illustrate how we get the corresponding concentration
(Figure S3): The fluorescence of protein-PyMDI-Zn with different concentration of glucose was
recorded, and the maximum concentration of glucose the give the perturbation of fluorescence
intensity less than 10% was about 20 mM.
Figure S3
Question 8.
There are no descriptions in the method section about how the experiments in part 4.4 are performed.
Thank the reviewer for the helpful suggestions. The following are the descriptions of how the
experiments in part 4.4 are performed: “100µl solutions containing different amounts of protein (0
to 600 µg) with 100 µM PyMDI-Zn were incubated at room temperature for about 5 minutes. Then,
the fluorescence of those samples was detected at 520nm with excitation at 486 nm by Thermo
Scientific Varioskan Flash. The concentration of protein was plotted against the corresponding
fluorescent intensity to obtain a standard curve. The protein concentration of the unknown samples
was determined by the standard curve. Protein solutions are normally assayed in triplicate.” We have
added this description in part 3.6 into the Materials and Methods section in our revised manuscript.
Reply to the Comments by Reviewer 2
We sincerely appreciate the Reviewer 2 for his/her positive and professional comments. The
Reviewer 2 pointed out that: “This study is interesting and provide a useful contribution to the
literature.” We thank reviewer 2 for his/her useful suggestion to help us improve the manuscript.
Following are our point-by-point answers to the comments and suggestions to our manuscript.
Question 1.
The style of this manuscript is confused, such as Figures.
Thank for the helpful suggestion of the reviewer. We have unified the style of our manuscript and
supplementary materials.
Question 2.
The language needs to be revised and improved.
Thank the reviewer for his/her careful reading. Our manuscript has been edited by a native
English speaker. The manuscript and Supplementary material with correction traces are submitted
too.
Question 3.
The methods should be compared with other fluorescent probe methods, not only CBB.
Thank the reviewer for his professional suggestion. SYPRO Orange is one of the most commonly
used fluorescent dye, and we chose it for the comparison experiment because it is a sensitive, ready-
to-use fluorescent gel stain for proteins. After staining for typically 30-60 minutes in the dye
solution, gels can be photographed after a quick rinse in 7.5% acetic acid. Protein samples were
commercial protein markers, which contain proteins of 120 kDa (100ng/µl), 100 kDa (100ng/µl),
80 kDa (100ng/µl), 60 kDa (100ng/µl), 50 kDa (200 ng/µl), 40 kDa (100ng/µl), 30 kDa (100ng/µl),
and 20 kDa (100ng/µl). Different amounts of protein marker were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE,
and then these gels were stained with PyMDI-Zn and SYPRO Orange respectively.
Figure S4
As shown in Figure S4, SYPRO Orange afforded a lower background and a higher fluorescent
response to protein bands (50-120 kDa) than PyMDI-Zn on the gel. But, as for the proteins with
lower molecular weight (20, 30 and 40 kDa), PyMDI-Zn gave better staining results. And according
to the suggestion of the reviewer, Figure S3 have been added into supplementary materials.
