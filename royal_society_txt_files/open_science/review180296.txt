It was a pleasure to read this very interesting article. We as human beings have always been
intrigued to control nature, and this bionic approach to combine artificial robots with natural
growing organisms is a sympathetic further step in this direction. Instead of one way control this
approach represent a two-way communication. Achieving shape through growth of plants is
interesting since it is represents a different paradigm to traditional manufacturing of artifacts. By
stimulating plants the right way we can achieve the geometries we desire instead of applying
manufacturing technology like machining, forging and casting.
The present research paper is a valuable contribution to the understanding of how plants can be
controlled and how they can interface to artificial machinery. It is shown how bean plants can be
stimulated using certain wavelengths of light to grow in a certain direction and change this
3
direction upon input. Overall, I am happy with the paper, but will recommend the following
clarifications to be implemented in the paper.
1) More details on the guiding blue light diodes. How directional are they and how far away do
they have an impact? Will they only affect the stem tip approaching along the rod leading to the
robotic node? Or does the blue light also have an impact on the other plants and branches?
2) It is described that the plants have difficulties in passing the nodes – it could take 11 days to
pass a node compared to only 8 days growing along a 40 cm rod. How come that this aspect was
not taken into consideration beforehand, e.g. by having a regular grid of rods with robots placed
at the side? The rest of the dimensioning of the experiment looks very well considered.
3) Robot logic: It is mentioned that the nodes only communicate with neighbour nodes and work
autonomously. Please explain more about this communication, e.g. what happens when a stem
tip is detected? How is it decided which of following nodes that should turn on the blue light and
hence control the direction of growth?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The paper presents an interesting approach for developing a bio-hybrid system made of a
distributed mechatronic node-based system that interacts with climbing plants in order to teach
them the growing path to be followed.
The work is well structured, the contents fall within the general scope of the journal and it could
provide a useful contribution to the literature.
However, the whole manuscript and work should be improved for reaching the level required by
the journal.
Indeed, most of the conclusions are based on only two main experiments that, even if promising,
could not be considered enough for a proper experimental evaluation.
4
Moreover, in the paper the authors use the word “robot” or “robotic node” even if they are using
a mechatronic system (sensors, microcontroller, led for emitting light, …) that, without a proper
definition, can not be considered a robot. In this regard, I would suggest either to give a
definition for "robot-node" or to use another term.
Finally, since bio-inspired and bio-hybrid plant-robotic systems are in some way the target of the
paper, it could be helpful to complete the “related work” section adding some considerations on
the works that deal with the bio-mimesis of climbing/twining/grasping plants (e.g. tendrils).
Other:
• Pag 8 - In the description of the node, the authors describe how they have chosen the sensors in
a quite rough way (e.g. very inaccurate, high accuracy, several tests,…). It would be better to give
precise info on the accuracy of both the chosen and discarded solutions.
• Pag 5, line 16-18 – please support the sentence/statement with reference/s.
• Fig 8 a is not introduced in the text. Fig. 8 c seems to be introduced before Fig 8b and a. The
label of fig 8 contains the acronym GEM that has not been defined yet.
• Pag 14 – lines 53-55 : how many detection?
Notes: which is the effect of the node dimension on the plants’ failures in climbing around it? I
think it would be important to make it smaller and with a proper curvature since in climbing
plants the support curvature and dimension heavily affect the climbing and “grasping” success.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Manoj Srinivasan):
Associate Editor: 1
Comments to the Author:
label_comment_4
Further comments to consider:
1) I agree with one of the reviewers that suggested that something like 'mechatronic' (pr
something else) may be a better description of the device than 'robotic'. But it is also fine to leave
the terminology as 'robotic', especially if you can provide reasonable evidence of precedence for
such usage. Is everything that senses and actuates a robot, even if not moving? Is a motion-
activated light that one commonly sees in homes and office buildings a "robot"?
2) It would be good to note explicitly what the advance in the current article is compared to
previous articles by overlapping authors. e.g.,
Hofstadler, D.N., Wahby, M., Heinrich, M.K., Hamann, H., Zahadat, P., Ayres, P. and Schmickl,
T., 2017. Evolved control of natural plants: Crossing the reality gap for user-defined steering of
growth and motion. ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems (TAAS), 12(3),
p.15.
Hamann, H., Soorati, M.D., Heinrich, M.K., Hofstadler, D.N., Kuksin, I., Veenstra, F., Wahby, M.,
Nielsen, S.A., Risi, S., Skrzypczak, T. and Zahadat, P., 2017. Flora robotica--An Architectural
System Combining Living Natural Plants and Distributed Robots. arXiv preprint
arXiv:1709.04291.
3) I agree with one of the reviewers that said that it may be worthwhile to provide greater
experimental support. Your figure 10 shows that the plant has achieved the Z-shaped growth
pattern intended by the authors. However, it is not clear to me if this could have been achieved
just by chance. The authors should show reasonable statistical evidence that the 'success' trials are
not by chance. This would require either more growth experiments with either the same pattern,
or ideally, different patterns. You could also compare the growth and tip movement results with,
7
say, a control experiment where the same scaffolding grid is provided, but with none of the
nodes switched on (so there is no control). If there are not to be more experiments, please explain
why the provided evidence is sufficient to support the conclusion that the technique presented is
viable. You may want to remark that the plant tip motion provides more evidence of successful
control than the actual plant growth alone. In the 'final configuration' of figure 10, some part of
the plant has also gone to the bottom-right branch of the grid, which is not user-desired.
4) In figure 2, the different elements of the figure must be completely labeled. What do the
different colors of different layers of grid mean, where are the different actuator nodes, etc?
Please make the figure and caption mostly self-contained, so that the reader need not read
through the paper to understand the figure.
5) Figure labels occasionally use title case. Just use sentence case. some of the figure panels are too
small in the typeset version of the figures. e.g., figure 8b and figure 10b, especially its inset. for
10b, perhaps use a white background, but not one that is so close to the device that there are
shadows due to the flash. figure 9 caption says: "Control experiment #1, 3 plants collapsed, after
15 days." 3 plants out of how many? Please make the figures, the figure labels and the captions
more self-contained. In figure 10 caption, please say what we are supposed to see in the figure
and state the result. There appears to be a rightward growth as well. Please comment and discuss
how common un-desired growth is (which requires more experiments).
6) in figure 10b, what are the two sets of curves separated horizontally? what are the different
curves separated vertically? please explain in more detail.

To address the following editor’s comments:
“1) I agree with one of the reviewers that suggested that something like 'mechatronic'
(or something else) may be a better description of the device than 'robotic'. But it is
also fine to leave the terminology as 'robotic', especially if you can provide reasonable
evidence of precedence for such usage.”
The terminology for the device has been changed from ‘robotic’ to ‘mechatronic’ or
‘distributed mechatronic’ throughout the full paper, to avoid any confusion for the
reader.
“2) It would be good to note explicitly what the advance in the current article is
compared to previous articles by overlapping authors.”
In section 2, the technological advancement in the current article over previous
technological publications by overlapping authors is addressed by the new text
“However, as reported in previous works [14,15,16], robots were able to control the
directional growth of unsupported plants by introducing changes to the environment
(e.g., light stimulus). In these previous works, light stimuli were autonomously used to
shape young, unsupported plants of a stem length less than 30 cm. Here, a mechanical
and mechatronic setup is engineered to extend this state-of-the-art to much larger
plants, demonstrated with supported climbing plants of a stem length over 2 m.” and
the relationship between the current article and previous perspective/overview
publications is addressed by the new text “This engineered system contributes toward
open challenges that have been previously introduced for bio-hybrids in autonomous
construction [17,18].”
“3) I agree with one of the reviewers that said that it may be worthwhile to provide
greater experimental support. Your figure 10 shows that the plant has achieved the Z-
shaped growth pattern intended by the authors. However, it is not clear to me if this
could have been achieved just by chance. The authors should show reasonable
statistical evidence that the 'success' trials are not by chance. This would require either
more growth experiments with either the same pattern, or ideally, different patterns.
You could also compare the growth and tip movement results with, say, a control
experiment where the same scaffolding grid is provided, but with none of the nodes
switched on (so there is no control). If there are not to be more experiments, please
explain why the provided evidence is sufficient to support the conclusion that the
technique presented is viable. You may want to remark that the plant tip motion
provides more evidence of successful control than the actual plant growth alone. In the
'final configuration' of figure 10, some part of the plant has also gone to the bottom-
right branch of the grid, which is not user-desired.”
We have improved the experiment section by more clearly documenting pre-existing
results and by adding new experiments. We first present “control experiments” (where
the same scaffold and setup is provided, but none of the nodes are triggered, and
therefore there is no control), and second “verification experiments” to show further
supporting evidence that the success trials are not by chance, and that the node
reliably influences the plant to choose the correct rod on which to grow. These two
experiment types can be seen in the video accompanying the paper, and their
descriptions in the paper are:
In section 3(d), text was updated introducing the experiment types, including the
control experiments and verification experiments: “We run three types of experiments
to test the performance of the bio-hybrid system. First, we run control experiments
where all mechatronic nodes are set constantly to the feeding state, to test the growth
and motion behavior of the plants in conditions without triggered phototropism.
Second, we verify the ability of the mechatronic nodes' guiding state to guide plant
growth to the correct target (in a binary decision between left and right), by triggering
the plants' phototropic response to blue light. Third, we test the ability of the
mechatronic nodes and bio-hybrid setup to correctly shape plant growth into a
predefined pattern on the 180 cm diagrid, in two full-length experiments.”
Control experiments method description in section 3(d,i): “The two control experiments
are conducted with four plants each, over a total time period of about three weeks. In
each experiment, the diagrid frame, nodes, and GEMs are present, but all nodes are
kept in feeding state for the duration of the experiments. The GEMs are used for
monitoring and photo documentation. There is no phototropic blue light stimulus
present in the control experiments—as grow lamps emit only red light—disregarding
the camera flash occurring for two seconds every two minutes.”
Control experiments results description in section 4(a): “The climber plants showed
unbiased upwards growth due to the lack of a directional phototropic stimulus by blue
light, in addition to standard gravitropism (i.e., growth against gravity) that drives
plants upwards, see Fig. 10(a). The typical circumnutation (i.e., winding motion
behavior) was observed, a plant behavior to explore the environment and search for
climbing support (see Sec. 3). However, as expected, the plants were not able to find
and attach to the location and orientation of the diagrid rods without further external
steering. The experiments were stopped when at least two of the four plants grew to a
height that caused them to collapse from unsupported self-weight, see Fig. 10(b) and
Fig. 10(c). None of the plants attached to the scaffold.”
Control experiment results are shown in figure 9, with the overall caption: “Frames of
results from control experiments, where the plants are exposed only to feeding light
spectra and not to guiding light. Without any guiding light, none of the eight total
plants attached to a diagrid rod.”
Verification experiments method description in section 3(d,ii): “The verification
experiments are conducted over approximately seven weeks in total, and each contain
a minimum of four plants. In these experiments, we test the ability of the distributed
mechatronic system to guide the plant toward a specified target, by steering the plant's
decision-making at a given junction. This is tested in two experiments per target
direction at the first diagrid junction. In each experiment, the targeted node (left or
right) is set to the guiding state, and the opposing node is set to the feeding state. An
experiment is considered successful if all attached plant tips find the correct rod, and
only the guiding node detects an approaching plant. Another feature considered
favorable is a high proportion of unsupported shoots being oriented to the guiding
node.
Verification experiment results description in section 4(b): “Here there are two
experiments per target, all at the first diagrid junction, with 13 days of continuous
experiment time on average. The plants successfully choose and attach to the correct
rod, climbing it until the guiding node is reached, see Fig. 11. In over 90% of
unsupported shoots, we observe the typical circumnutation motion of winding to be
pronouncedly biased to the guiding node. This results in consistent tilting of the upright
stems toward that node, in parts where the tissues have stiffened. In each experiment,
the plant with stem angle and location most similar to that of the correct rod (i.e., the
rod connected to the guiding node) is the first to attach. In each case, that first (or
leading) plant continues to climb the rod until it reaches the guiding node. In one
experiment, a second plant also attached to the correct rod. The experiments were
stopped once a plant reached the guiding node. Out of over 20 total plants in all
verification experiments, none of the plants attached to the wrong rod (i.e., the rod
leading to the feeding node). Taken together, these results suggest that the
mechatronic nodes are capable of reliably attracting plant growth towards the specified
target.”
Verification experiment results are shown in figure 11, with the overall caption:
“Frames of results from the verification experiments, which test the ability of the
mechatronic nodes' guiding state to reliably attract plant growth onto the correct
diagrid rod. In the left guiding experiments—#1 (a,e) and #2 (b,g)—the node left of
the junction is set to the guiding state, with the opposing set to feeding (a,b). In the
right guiding experiments—#1 (c,f) and #2 (d,h)—the node right of the junction is set
to the guiding state, with the opposing set to feeding (c,d). Each frame shows the
condition of growth just before the guiding node detected an approaching plant. In all
four experiments (see e,f,g,h), at least one plant attached to the correct rod (i.e., the
one leading to the guiding node). None of the plants attached to the incorrect rod. In
further evidence of the nodes’ effects, the unsupported plants also are generally
displaying growth biased toward the guiding node.”
Further information and new clarifications regarding the final configuration' of figure 10
are provided below.
“4) In figure 2, the different elements of the figure must be completely labeled. What
do the different colors of different layers of grid mean, where are the different actuator
nodes, etc? Please make the figure and caption mostly self-contained, so that the
reader need not read through the paper to understand the figure.”
The caption on figure 2 was updated to: “The mechatronic node is generalized to
accommodate large scale 3D setups, with nodes placed back-to-back in a mechanically
modular diagrid frame that can be configured into user-defined 3D patterns. (Top) An
example setup of back-to-back nodes integrated into a mechanical 3D diagrid. Example
setup has nodes arranged in 2D diagrids along four equidistantly spaced planes (red,
orange, green, blue), with 3D diagrid connections occurring between neighboring
planes. Two of these 2D diagrids are one-sided (far-left, red; far-right, blue), the
others two-sided (center-left, orange; center-right, green). Because it is a 3D diagrid,
for each pair of neighboring planes, the respective 2D node positions are translated
along both axes, by half the width and length of a diagrid cell. In this example, two
planes have nodes in starting 2D positions (far-left, red; center-right, green), and the
other two have nodes in translated 2D positions (center-left, orange; far-right, blue).
The translated positions are a feature of a 3D diagrid, allowing all diagrid rods to be of
the same length (compare rods visible in side view to those in front/back views). The
experiments reported in this paper are conducted in a setup with dimensionality
reduced to 2D, and on a single-sided setup reduced in scale. (Bottom left) An example
setup of back-to-back nodes in a double-sided 2D diagrid setup, of the same scale and
2D node positions of a plane from the example 3D setup (center-left, orange). (Bottom
right) The simple setup used in the experiments described here; a small quantity of
isolated nodes in a single-sided 2D diagrid. This setup matches a portion of the larger
double-sided setup (bottom left, orange, highlighted in black).”
Some text was also moved from section 3(c) to 3(b), to appear before figure 2.
“5) Figure labels occasionally use title case. Just use sentence case.”
Caption of figure 9(c) (“Plant Binary Decision Wall”) updated to sentence case. Two
other occurrences of the same, also updated to sentence case. One caption, of figure
3(b) (“Raspberry Pi HAT”), looks like title case because “Raspberry Pi” is a proper noun.
Section titles in title case also updated to sentence case.
“Some of the figure panels are too small in the typeset version of the figures. e.g.,
figure 8b and figure 10b, especially its inset.”
Figures 9(a), 9(b), 12(b) (previously 10(b)) have been substantially enlarged, and
figures 3(a), 3(b), 5(a), 5(b), 6, 8, 9(c) slightly enlarged, in the typeset version. In-
figure text sizes updated accordingly in figures 6, 8, 9(a), 9(b). In-figure text sizes also
improved in figure 2.
“For 10b, perhaps use a white background, but not one that is so close to the device
that there are shadows due to the flash.”
Unfortunately, this photograph is not able to be retaken, as the plant experiment was
completed some months ago and is no longer in the same growth state. New
experiment photos also have shadows from the flash, as the authors regrettably do not
have sufficient lab infrastructure to situate the experiments in a room large enough to
photograph away from a wall surface.
“Figure 9 caption says: "Control experiment #1, 3 plants collapsed, after 15 days." 3
plants out of how many?”
Captions updated, figure 10(a) “Control experiment #2, all four plants showing straight
upward growth with no attachments, after five days.”, 10(b) “Control experiment #1,
three of four plants collapsed, one growing upward without attachment, after 15
days.”, 10(c) “Control experiment #2, two of four plants collapsed, two growing upward
without attachment, after seven days.”. Text also updated to make number of plants
and results description more clear, in section 3(d(i)) and 4(a).
“Please make the figures, the figure labels and the captions more self-contained.”
Caption on figure 2 was updated (details above), and caption on figure 12 updated
(details below).
Caption of figure 3 updated to: “Mechatronic node for phototropic shaping of climbing
plants. (a) Case design incorporating IR-proximity sensors, photoresistors for light
intensity measurements, and nine RGB LEDs for plant actuation. (b) Custom Raspberry
Pi HAT (i.e., PCB mounted on a Raspberry Pi Zero) to interface the board with the
sensors and actuators.”
Caption of figure 5 updated to: “Preliminary mechatronic prototype and proximity
sensor experiments, including the successful IR and unsuccessful ultrasonic and
capacitive touch. (a) A prototype incorporating both IR and ultrasonic proximity sensors
for accuracy comparison. (b) Test of capacitive touch sensing with soldering wire
wound around diagrid filaments.”
Caption of figure 6 updated to: “Plant tip climbing a diagrid rod, approaching the
attachment point with the mechatronic node, arriving in the field of view of the
respective IR-proximity sensor. The placement and orientation of the IR-proximity
sensor in relation to the rod attachment point guarantees accurate plant tip detection.”
Caption of figure 8 updated to: “(Left) Placement and orientation of six RGB LEDs to
trigger phototropism and attract plants growing along three 3D diagrid directions. The
faceted dome where the LEDs are mounted allows the surface normal of three of those
faces to roughly bifurcate two of the rod directions. This is demarcated by the colored
arrows (red, green, blue) showing the rod directions serviced by each LED. (E.g., LEDs
with blue arrows can service the blue rod direction.) This distributes the power
consumption without increasing the quantity of total LEDs, and reduces the heat load
on each individual LED. (right) Mechatronic node body from standard view planes (side,
front, bottom), showing the relationship of the LED dome faces to the other faces of the
node, and to the 3D diagrid rods.”
Caption of figure 10 updated to: “Frames of results from control experiments, where
the plants are exposed only to feeding light spectra and not to guiding light. Without
any guiding light, none of the eight total plants attached to a diagrid rod.”
“In figure 10 caption, please say what we are supposed to see in the figure and state
the result. There appears to be a rightward growth as well.”
Updated the caption of Figure 12 (previously 10): “Main result, predefined-pattern
experiment #2. (a) Z-shaped pattern overlaid on the diagrid map. The mechatronic
nodes are programmed to grow a single plant into this user-defined pattern, on the 180
cm setup. (b) Frame of final experiment configuration after 40 days. In this
experiment, the leading plant---the one which the nodes are programmed to guide---
has successfully fulfilled the user-defined pattern. The leading plant has consecutively
grown along each diagrid rod in the pattern (towards the respective guiding node), and
successfully triggered each node in the pattern, reaching the final node at the top of
the diagrid. The leading plant never attached to an incorrect rod. The non-leading
plants (i.e., those that climbed the diagrid at a later stage in the experiment), though
not the main feature being tested in this experiment, also provide relevant results.
There are non-leading plants outside the pattern in (a) because they grew towards the
currently triggered node. For instance, the non-leading plants in the lower right corner
attached to that rod because at the time it represented their most direct route toward
the currently triggered node.”
“Please comment and discuss how common un-desired growth is (which requires more
experiments).”
This is relevant to the new experiments and clarifications described above (regarding
control and verification experiments).
In addition, the text has been updated in section 3(d,iii), regarding the method used in
the predefined-pattern experiments. This is done to clarify the growth that the setup is
programmed to execute, and which features of growth are being tested in these
experiments. The new relevant text is: “Here, we investigate the ability of the
decentralized and distributed mechatronic system to grow a plant into a predefined
shape. We conduct two such experiments, over a total time period of approximately 14
weeks. In these experiments, the mechatronic nodes are programmed to grow a single
plant into the given shape. However, because plant experiments are costly in time, we
include four plants and collect additional information on the overall growth (see Sec. 4).
In each predefined-pattern experiment, the first plant to attach to the diagrid at any
point is considered the leading plant. The experiments then test the interaction of this
leading plant with the mechatronic nodes, which are programmed to shape it into to
the user-defined pattern. The experiment ends when the leading plant reaches the final
node in the pattern. It is considered successful if the leading plant consecutively
reaches every node and rod in the pattern, and does not attach to an incorrect rod.”
The description of results provided in figure 12 has also been updated, to further
clarify.
Other than the time period of one technical malfunction of the camera in the setup, a
leading plant (i.e. the one whose growth is being tested in the predefined-pattern
experiments, as the nodes in these experiments are programmed to guide the growth
of a single plant), never grew on an un-desired rod.
“6) in figure 10b, what are the two sets of curves separated horizontally? what are the
different curves separated vertically? please explain in more detail.”
For figure 13(b) (previously 11(b), to which we believe this comment refers), the
following has been added to the caption of figure 13: “The start point of each curve in
(b) occurs at the frame when that plant tip attaches to the relevant rod. Horizontally,
one group of curves begins around the 200th-500th frame; this group of plant tips
attaches to a new rod quickly after the last node triggering event. The other group of
curves begins around the 1500th-1800th frame; this group attaches to a new rod more
slowly, and is comprised of plant tips climbing around a mechatronic node to reach the
opposing rod. Vertically, the start points of curves occur according to the distance of
the plant tip from the triggered node when the tip attaches to the new rod. Regardless
of the time and location of the tip attachment, each curve in (b) declines steadily, as all
attached plant tips progress reliably toward the currently triggered node.”
To address the following additional comments from the reviewers:
Reviewer 2:
“1) More details on the guiding blue light diodes. How directional are they and how far
away do they have an impact? Will they only affect the stem tip approaching along the
rod leading to the robotic node? Or does the blue light also have an impact on the other
plants and branches?”
Specifications of the diodes have been added to section 3(b,i) as “The RGB LEDs emit
light at <U+03BB> <U+2208> {625, 525, 465} nm respectively with maximum light intensity F <U+2208> {40, 55,
15} lumens respectively. Each RGB LED has a viewing angle of 120° and a total
maximal dissipation of 3 W.”
The effect on other (non-leading) plants has been addressed as part of the editor’s
comments above.
“2) It is described that the plants have difficulties in passing the nodes – it could take
11 days to pass a node compared to only 8 days growing along a 40 cm rod. How come
that this aspect was not taken into consideration beforehand, e.g. by having a regular
grid of rods with robots placed at the side? The rest of the dimensioning of the
experiment looks very well considered.”
The relevant constraints have been described further in section 3(b,iv) in the updated
text: “The shape of the mechatronic node body needs to allow plants to surpass it,
though it serves a modest structural role as the node of diagrid intersections. Because
the diagrid rods are coplanar and structurally stiff, they pass through the center of the
mechatronic node. This type of connection to the node also provides some resistance to
rotation when vertical loads are placed on the diagrid.”
In section 5 we also mention this issue for discussion: “Perhaps a different mechatronic
node design of smaller size, or of different incorporation into the mechanical frame,
could allow the plants to climb more smoothly around it.” and future work: “A more
flexible structural scaffold, could potentially be integrated with the nodes in such a way
that the elements for climbing wrap along the outer surface of the node instead of
passing through the center, making it easier for a plant to climb past the node.”
“3) Robot logic: It is mentioned that the nodes only communicate with neighbour nodes
and work autonomously. Please explain more about this communication, e.g. what
happens when a stem tip is detected? How is it decided which of following nodes that
should turn on the blue light and hence control the direction of growth?”
In section 3(d,iii), the text describing the programming of the nodes has been edited to
increase clarity regarding communication between the nodes, and is updated to: “Here,
we investigate the ability of the decentralized and distributed mechatronic system to
grow plants in predefined shapes. We initialize the system (see Algorithm 1) by
providing each node its location on the diagrid map and the required final pattern (z-
shaped pattern), see Fig. 10(a). The nodes use this predefined pattern and
communication with only their direct neighbors to trigger their state change. Only one
node is allowed to be in the guiding state at any given time. Hence, one node in the
first level sets its state to guiding according to the predefined pattern. Once the node
detects an approaching plant (see Algorithm 2), it notifies its direct neighbors and
switches its state to feeding. The node on the next level that has a location on the
predefined pattern will then switch its state to guiding. This process is repeated until a
node on the final level detects an approaching plant.”
Reviewer 3:
“Most of the conclusions are based on only two main experiments”
Addressed as part of the editor’s comments; please see changes listed above.
“The authors use the word “robot” or “robotic node” even if they are using a
mechatronic system (sensors, microcontroller, led for emitting light, …) that, without a
proper definition, can not be considered a robot. In this regard, I would suggest either
to give a definition for "robot-node" or to use another term.”
Addressed as part of the editor’s comments; please see changes listed above.
“Since bio-inspired and bio-hybrid plant-robotic systems are in some way the target of
the paper, it could be helpful to complete the “related work” section adding some
considerations on the works that deal with the bio-mimesis of
climbing/twining/grasping plants (e.g. tendrils).”
In section 2, new text is added: “In bio-inspired engineering, a variety of plants'
climbing mechanisms are viewed as applicable to materials and actuation [22,23],
including microscopic hairs augmenting the twining mechanism of the common bean
plant, utilized here. Climbing plants that use tendrils have been studied to develop
climbing robots [24] and linear actuators [25], and those using microscopic hooks on
the surface of leaves have been mimicked for a dry adhesive [26]. Engineered systems
that incorporate biological tissues or organisms have been developed for other robotic
tasks (e.g., [27]), but to the authors' knowledge have not yet been developed for
climbing, although investigation into the attachment strength of certain climbing plants
has progressed [28].”
“Pag 8 - In the description of the node, the authors describe how they have chosen the
sensors in a quite rough way (e.g. very inaccurate, high accuracy, several tests,…). It
would be better to give precise info on the accuracy of both the chosen and discarded
solutions.”
For the discarded capacitive touch sensing, the text describes: “the plants were
correctly detected approximately 30% of the time”
For a comparison between the discarded ultrasonic and the selected IR, a new figure
(figure 7) and further text has been added to clarify their accuracy. The text is: “In
Fig.7, sensor data is given for a plant tip approaching both an IR and ultrasonic sensor,
present in the same mechatronic node. As described in Fig.7, the data of the IR sensor
in Fig.7(a) shows a clear and reliable reaction to the presence of a plant, while the data
of the ultrasonic sensor in Fig. 7(b) shows no discernible pattern.” and the figure
caption is “Detection data for IR (a) and ultrasonic (b) sensors in the same node.
Shortly after 03.04.2016, the plant approaches the node. In (a) notice the smooth and
pronounced spikes in the IR sensor data, when the plant tip in inside the field of view of
the sensor, and detection occurs. Due to the typical winding behavior (i.e.,
circumnutation) of the plant tip, which is both quick and broad, the tip moves back out
of sensor field of view (and the IR sensor data returns to the state it held prior to
03.04.2016). It moves in and out of the field of view several times, with varying
durations. In the IR data, the difference between a present plant and an absent plant
can be seen very clearly. The plant tip then grows very close to the sensor around
09.04.16. At this time, the IR sensor consistently detects the presence of the plant tip.
By comparison, no consistent pattern can be seen in the Ultrasonic sensor data (b), as
it shows no reliable reaction to the presence of a plant. This is both because the
ultrasonic sensor cannot see the plant unless it has a reflective surface oriented in a
very narrow angle range, and because false positives can occur from reflective surfaces
on other objects.”
“Pag 5, line 16-18 – please support the sentence/statement with reference/s.”
In section 3(a, ii), last paragraph, the text now includes a reference for tropisms as a
whole, as well as one for phototropism and general plant movement: “A different
category of movements are tropisms, or active directed motion and growth toward (or
away from) environmental cues [43]. Motion behaviors normally operate
simultaneously [44], with bean shoots balancing, at minimum, the effects of negative
gravitropism (growth against gravity, the most prevalent tropism of land plants
[45,46]); positive phototropism (growth toward light [47], explained below), and the
previously described circumnutation.”
“Fig 8 a is not introduced in the text. Fig. 8 c seems to be introduced before Fig 8b and
a.”
In section 3(c,i), figure 8(a) and 8(b) are now introduced prior to 8(c), in the following
text: “The PBDW contains eight mechatronic nodes, see Fig. 8(a), distributed in four
columns and four rows, on a geometrically regular diagrid frame. The setup includes
four early growth plant shoots at the base of the frame, see Fig. 8(b). The diagrid type
provides paths that are acceptable to a climbing plant, as the paths are never flatter
than 45°. For current PBDW experiments, only 2D coplanar rods are used, though the
mechatronic nodes also include hardware and connection points for 3D rods (for
potential use in future work, see Fig. 2). The PBDW setup is 125 cm x 0.5 cm x 180 cm
in width, depth, and height, see Fig. 8(c).”
“The label of fig 8 contains the acronym GEM that has not been defined yet.”
The caption of figure 8 is updated to include “Global Environment Monitors (GEMs)”.
“Pag 14 – lines 53-55 : how many detection?”
In section 4(c), text is updated to denote 7 detections: “In both experiments, each of
the seven times a plant tip grows along a diagrid rod and approaches a node, the node
successfully detects the tip”

ssociate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Manoj Srinivasan):
sociate Editor: 1
mments to the Author:
e authors have carefully revised the article to address the editorial and reviewer
mments. Overall I appreciate the details provided and the article is mostly clear. The
ised supplementary video is also good. Two small comments:”
) The article would benefit from a careful proof-read, as one of the reviewer suggests.”
A thorough and careful proofread was executed.
) Please clearly emphasize in the abstract, the introduction, and the conclusion the
limitation that only limited test of the mechatronic system was performed.”
In the Abstract, we have added:
"Key limitations are the number of repetitions performed and the scale of the systems
tested."
In the Introduction, we have added:
"Key limitations here are the scale of the natural and mechatronic systems, and the
number of repetitions possible with the current experiment overhead."
In the Discussion, we have added:
"One important limitation here is the scale of the bio-hybrid system. Further investigation
would be required to confirm the extension of the approach to large groups of plants and
distributed mechatronics, in which many simultaneous plant decisions must be
supported and steered. In such large systems, plant health must also be maintained for
longer periods and in further developmental stages. Another important limitation is the
number of repetitions performed, restricted by the high degree of experiment overhead.
Both large scale systems and increased repetitions would need to be supported by a
mass production approach to the mechatronics, and by substantial greenhouse
infrastructure within plant science or other biology labs."
In the Conclusion, we have added:
"Key limitations are the number of experiment repetitions and the scale tested."
