This is an interesting and useful contribution to the mathematical literature on the quasispecies
model, and I find the results well worth publishing, and the presentation clear and thoughtful.
I have, however, one small question, which I could not answer myself while reading your
manuscript. As it should always be done, the authors are very careful discussing the co-
dimension of the bifurcation. This is especially important in this particular case that deals with
the appearance of a line of non-isolated equilibria. The authors claim, in the Discussion section,
that "... inside the quasispecies models and assuming that matrix A is irreducible, is just a
codimension 2 bifurcation."
It seems to me, however, that the assumption must be that A is reducible, as, for instance, it is
true for system (2) for all possible parameter values. If I am correct, then the discussion of the
bifurcation co-dimension within the quasispecies models must also involve the analysis of the co-
dimension of the phenomena that a matrix is reducible in the set of all possible non-negative
matrices, which seems to lead again to the conclusion that even in the space of all possible
quasispecies models the co-dimension of the studied bifurcation is infinite.
As a reader I would appreciate if the author clarify this point in the revision.

Reviewer’s Report
Manuscript ID RSOS-171304: "Trans-heteroclinic bifurcation: a novel type of catastrophic shift"
Comments
In a previous work (Reference [44]), the authors have considered a mathematical model
describing the dynamics of competition between healthy and tumor cells with different
phenotypes and have identified a type of abrupt (catastrophic) transition given by a non-standard
bifurcation. Named by the authors as trans-heteroclinic, this bifurcation occurs when two distant
fixed points interchange stability without colliding, as it would happen in a transcritical
bifurcation.
Precisely in this context, the present work provides an exhaustive description of this new
bifurcation, stablishing the conditions needed for this transition to take place in the general
quasispecies replicator model, developing this way a thorough analysis of the mechanisms
responsible for this bifurcation. In addition, it has been studied the effect of small perturbations at
the abrupt transition value.
In my opinion, with this work it is presented a powerful mathematical framework providing
general conditions for which catastrophic shifts due to trans-heteroclinic bifurcations should be
expected.
In the context of their study, the authors provide an analytical approach that I believe is still
lacking in the literature. This analysis is supported by numerical results that perfectly match the
theoretical predictions.
The complexity of biological systems makes the interdisciplinary involvement essential. The
work presented by the authors is precisely a result of a really interdisciplinary research
environment.
The paper is technically correct and it is sufficiently accessible to the non-specialist reader.
There is a logical flow of argument, and validity of conclusions drawn.
Minor corrections
Page 10, lines 39 and 40, where it is written: ‘Pitchfork bifrucations have been ecently
identified…’,
It should be written: ‘Pitchfork bifrucations have been recently identified…’
This study provides another illustration of how an integrated approach, involving numerical
evidences and theoretical reasoning, can directly enhance our understanding of biologically
motivated models. It will certainly stimulate the development of new research on this subject.
In short, this manuscript is entirely suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science.

This is an interesting and useful contribution to the mathematical literature on the
quasispecies model, and I find the results well worth publishing, and the
presentation clear and thoughtful.
I have, however, one small question, which I could not answer myself while reading
your manuscript. As it should always be done, the authors are very careful
discussing the co-dimension of the bifurcation. This is especially important in this
particular case that deals with the appearance of a line of non-isolated equilibria.
The authors claim, in the Discussion section, that "... inside the quasispecies models
and assuming that matrix A is irreducible, is just a codimension 2 bifurcation."
It seems to me, however, that the assumption must be that A is reducible, as, for
instance, it is true for system (2) for all possible parameter values. If I am correct,
then the discussion of the bifurcation co-dimension within the quasispecies models
must also involve the analysis of the co-dimension of the phenomena that a matrix is
reducible in the set of all possible non-negative matrices, which seems to lead again
to the conclusion that even in the space of all possible quasispecies models the co-
dimension of the studied bifurcation is infinite.
As a reader I would appreciate if the author clarify this point in the revision.
We want to thank the Referee for this comment, since the text was not clear enough in
the terms coined by the Referee. Within matrices A of arbitrary large dimension the
reducibility has a co-dimension as large as one may want. We have modified the text
adding the next explanation at the end of Remark II.2, which now reads (added
sentence in red):
Remark II.2. Beyond the condition on the structure of $A$, we are requiring
the condition that the dominant eigenvalues of $B$ and $D$ coincide.
Furthermore, the existence of $\wn_2$ requires $(\lambda_1 I - D) \wn_2 = C
\wn_1$. As $\lambda_1$ is a simple eigenvalue of $D$, the kernel of
$(\lambda_1 I - D)$ has dimension one. Hence, the condition reduces to ask
that $C\wn_1$ has no component in that kernel. Summarizing, the request
reduces to two scalar conditions (beyond the positivity or zero values of the
components of $\wn_2$). Therefore, the condition for the trans-heteroclinic
bifurcation has codimension two in the equations of the family \eqref{eeq}, if
we assume that the matrix $A$ has the structure given in Remark \ref{rem1},
as it happens for the system (2) in the present study.
