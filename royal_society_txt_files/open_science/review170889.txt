General comments:
The manuscript has improved substantially since the previous version. The theoretical
background is clearer and a table has been added with the predictions of the different
hypotheses. Also, the description of the methods is more complete and the interpretation of the
results is sounder. In addition, the new names for the hypothesis, the groups and the tests, plus
the English revision, make the manuscript easier to read. I still have, however, some concerns
about the two hypotheses tested:
Expecting larger objects above smaller objects: In their responses to my comments, the authors
mention that monkeys rarely pile up objects, so the idea of monkeys associating high positions
with large objects based on quantity does not seem plausible to them. I agree with that. They
instead give the hierarchy explanation, where higher-ranking individuals occupy higher spots
than lower-ranking individuals. However, it would be good that the authors mentioned whether
this is the case in long-tailed macaques, since not all species behave in that way. If this were not
the case of the macaques, calling this “hierarchy” hypothesis would not be justified. Moreover, in
this case there would be no basis, either physical or social, for this hypothesis and the authors
should perhaps consider the possibility of removing it. If they still preferred to keep it “not to
change the predictions in the light of the results” (which I understand and share), they should try
to find a way to justify it and give more weight to the gravity hypothesis.
Expecting larger objects below smaller objects: When they explain this hypothesis, the authors
now refer to mass instead of weight. Since their hypothesis refers to the Aristotelian (naïve)
concept of gravity, however, I think talking about weight is preferable, since what we sense is
weight, not mass, so we make our judgements upon weight. Most importantly, the authors need
to explain better why this expectation is Aristotelian. I think the problem may come from the
examples given (the bending branch and the floating objects), which are totally valid nowadays
and do not correspond to a naïve idea of gravity (see my specific comments below). This is
relevant, since the validity of the hypothesis’ name (and the title of the paper) depends on the
authors being able to explain this.
Below I offer some specific comments:
L. 2-16: The abstract needs to be revised. There is no mention to the methods used (touch-screen
task, training to touch one of two shapes of different sizes), so when the results are reported they
cannot be understood. Also, the “naïve physics” interpretation of the results does not fit very well
with the discussion of the results in the present version of the manuscript.
L. 32-36: I suggest moving this text to the end of the previous paragraph.
L. 36-44: I suggest moving this text to the beginning of the next paragraph.
L. 45-47: I suggest removing this sentence, since it is redundant with L. 56-59.
L. 48-55: Since size is related to quantity, I would recommend moving this somewhere after
talking about numbers and quantities but before talking about hierarchy.
L. 66: Remove “due to their mass”.
L. 67: Change “on the ground” to “closer to the ground”.
L. 68-71: Consider removing this text. I would not involve culture here, nor hierarchy, and would
go directly to the examples. With regard to the water example, the authors should also refer to
the object’s size and not only to its weight, since they are trying to explain the association
between size and position, not weight and position.
Nevertheless, note that these examples do not necessarily correspond to naïve physical theories,
and particularly to Aristotle’s ideas, which revolved mainly on free-falling objects, as far as I
know (some references are needed on this point): Actually, larger objects are heavier than smaller
objects of the same kind and therefore exert more tension on the object they hang from (the
branch), or more pressure on the object on which they stand (the water), thus getting closer to the
ground. Therefore, maybe these are not the best examples here, or a better explanation of why
Aristotle is invoked is needed!
L. 77: Change “locations” to “arrangements” and ·target” to “two”.
L. 80: Eliminate “vertical” and add “(top vs bottom)” instead.
L. 88: Add a comma after “representation”.
7
L. 93: Change “they” to “the monkeys”.
L. 95: Add the evolutionary implications of this second hypothesis as well.
L. 110: Change “was” to “were”.
L. 113: Add “in the wild” after “macaques”.
L. 140: Remove “also”.
L. 143: Add a prediction for the different-size test.
L. 146-147: Move “-and viceversa…” to after “position”.
L. 183-184: Isn’t this redundant with L. 181?
L. 223-224: Appearing 4 times in each position or in total?
L. 260: Remove comma after “models”.
L. 268: Move “Stage 1” to the next line.
L. 368: Add “in” before “which”.
L. 415: Add “in knowing” before “if”.
L. 432: Do the authors want to involve culture here?
L. 435: Add “more” after “strive”.
L. 437: Add “more” after “stimulus”.
L. 459-460: I miss references to inhibitory control studies that used the “reversed-contingency
task” based on size.
L. 485: I would avoid talking about “excellent understanding” and would rather use “excellent
performance” or something similar.
L. 511: Not only “in which direction” stimulus size is associated with vertical position but also
“whether” there is such an association!

This paper aims at analyzing the possible interaction between the position of a stimulus relative
to another stimulus (i.e., above or below), and the perception of its relative size (i.e., larger or
smaller than the other stimulus) in long-tailed macaques. In particular, two hypotheses are
contrasted, a “cultural” association between large objects and high positions, and small objects
and low positions, resulting from the experience with cultural aspects like the display of social
hierarchies, and a naïve Aristotelian association between large objects and low positions, and
small objects and high positions, resulting from the experience with gravity. The method used is
a touch screen where pairs of shapes are shown to subjects, who must select one of the two
stimuli according to a previous training to touch the small (“small group”) or the large shape
(“large group”). Two tests are carried. In the first test, the two shapes to choose from have
different sizes and it is predicted that each group will perform better and faster when the target
shape is higher, or lower, depending on the hypothesis. In the second test, the two shapes have
similar sizes and it is expected that each group will tend to prefer the higher or the lower shape,
depending on the hypothesis. The authors claim to have found some evidence for the
Aristotelian hypothesis and explain some of the results based on the executive control
requirements of the task.
Overall, I find this paper interesting, although some aspects could be improved. My main
concern has to do with the hypotheses tested. Actually, a better explanation of the hypotheses
is needed in the introduction. With regard to the “cultural” hypothesis, there are many non-
human species where higher-ranking individuals occupy higher positions in trees or in rocky
sleeping sites, so there is no need to invoke culture for a possible association between high rank
and high locations. Actually, the authors say that chimpanzees mapped higher ranking
individuals with higher locations on a touch screen (L. 26-30), and chimpanzees do not have a
human-like culture. Moreover, the authors acknowledge that writing direction contributes to
the SNARC effect (L. 9-10) and, according to this, one would expect subjects associating low
numbers to high positions and not the other way around. So, “culture” can potentially explain
any result in this test, depending on what aspects of culture we take into account. With regard
to the Aristotelian hypothesis, the authors focus on gravity to explain why subjects might
associate larger objects with lower positions. They say that this is “more ecologically natural” (I
guess they mean “ecologically relevant”) than associating large objects with high positions
because the more quantity of something, the higher the level of that something (L. 49).
However, I see both explanations equally ecologically relevant, they just tap onto different
natural events (objects falling and objects accumulating). More important than that is that
gravity affects any object equally, unrelated to size or weight. So why should subjects expect to
find larger objects in lower positions? My prediction would be that subjects tend to search in
lower positions always, because all objects end up in the lowest position possible. By the way,
this fits quite well the results obtained in this study. In sum, the authors should justify their
hypotheses better, review the evidence from previous studies and provide information on the
species tested, which might be relevant for the predictions and the interpretation of the results.
My second main concern has to do with the authors’ interpretation of their results. On the one
hand, they acknowledge that their data do not fit any of the two hypotheses tested (L. 327, 350-
352, 409-411). On the other hand, they propose that their results can be explained by the
executive control demands of the task plus monkeys 1) having a bias to choose larger-sized
stimuli and 2) looking for large stimuli at bottom positions. Therefore, the authors invoke the
Aristotelian hypothesis to explain their data (L. 352-355, 361-362, 395-397, 399-400, 411-413).
I do not think this is necessary. Instead, their results can be explained by the monkeys 1) having
a bias towards larger objects and 2) tending to search for any kind of stimuli at bottom positions,
plus the executive control demands of the task. As acknowledged by the authors, the fact that
the macaques in the small group took longer to master the training suggests that their task was
harder. This may have resulted in them learning better to select according to stimuli size, which
might have made them more accurate in the case this added to the general trend towards the
bottom position (in the different sizes test) and less prone to select according to position only
(in the similar size test).
A third concern has to do with the written English. I think this paper would profit from a revision
by a native speaker.
Below I offer some specific comments, in order throughout the manuscript:
L. 6-8: A short explanation of the “SNARC effect” and the “spatial compatibility effect” is needed
here. What is the difference between them?
L. 8-13: If writing direction affects the SNARC effect, how come humans categorized higher
numbers and lower numbers better at the top and at the bottom of the screen, respectively, in
the example given above? This seems contradictory. Does culture really lead to a clear prediction
in this respect? Also, one is left wandering what kind of mapping did non-human species in the
studies cited. In brief, it would be good that the authors revised briefly the support found in
previous studies for the hypotheses tested here, both in humans and in other species.
L. 14-30: This paragraph is a bit confusing. The use of the term “cognition”, for instance, seems
to vary throughout the text, including “sensorymotor components and action” sometimes (L.
14) and being considered different to “perception and action” (L. 15-16) and “mental
representations” some other times (L. 20-21). More coherence is needed.
L. 48-56: I don’t see why the gravity explanation for large objects being associated with lower
positions is more ecologically relevant than the accumulation of objects explanation for larger
amounts of objects associated with higher levels.
L. 60: The use of long-tailed macaques should be justified. Why are they interesting?
L. 93-95: At what height was the touch-screen attached? Was it equally easy for the subjects to
touch any location?
L. 101-102: Where was the experimenter located? Did this have any effect on the subjects’
choices?
L. 110: Change “had to” tor “were rewarded for”.
L. 111-113: I suggest changing “large group” to “touch-large group”, and “small group” to
“touch-small group”. Otherwise, these names evoke the size of the group, not the size of the
rewarded stimulus.
L. 113-115: I suggest changing the name “Vertical test” to “Different-size test” and “Vertical
same size test” to “Same-size test” since, unlike the training, both tests are vertical and the main
difference between them is the relative size of the stimuli. This would be easier to read.
L. 115-118: The predictions for each hypothesis should be stated more clearly, perhaps in a table.
L. 127-142: Wasn’t there a starting touch in the familiarization phase? What if there were two
touches at the same time, or a second touch? How long did it take for subjects to learn to touch
one shape reliably? What does “reliably” mean here?
L. 144-145: I suggest changing “reward category” to “group (i.e., touch-large or touch-small)”, it
is clearer.
L. 145-147: Specify how many shapes were there in each stage. Change “learning criterion” to
“success criterion”. I would move this information to the beginning of the next paragraph.
L. 150: Were the positions fully random or was there a restriction in the number of times that,
e.g., the large shape could appear in a given position?
L. 161: What was the maximum number of trials in each phase? And in total?
L. 168-169: I would move this information to the beginning of the previous paragraph.
L. 169-176: I would add this information at the end of the previous paragraph.
L. 177: See my previous comment about the tests’ names. “Vertical test” is uninformative, since
both tests are vertical.
L. 181-183: So, subjects in the “large group” were better at discriminating their rewarded
stimulus. This could be because selecting the large stimulus is easier but could also reflect that
there were “smarter” individuals in that group. How were the groups formed, randomly?
L. 191: I find it hard to understand “Reward category” at first sight. “Target size” would be much
better.
L. 203: I think a first main focus should be on the horizontal training: do long-tailed macaques
learn better/faster to select larger or smaller objects? (A second main focus should have been a
vertical, same-size test, to respond to the question: do long-tailed macaques prefer selecting
higher or lower positions? Unfortunately, this was not done). Then would come the tests: do
long-tailed macaques search preferentially in higher or lower positions depending on whether
they search for large or small objects?
L. 213-216: What predictions did the authors have?
L. 217-118: I do not understand this.
L. 224: The results of the training should be shown before the test, since they are relevant for
the discussion. Also, see my previous comments regarding the tests’ names.
L. 225-228: That is the prediction for the gravity hypothesis. What about the “cultural”
hypothesis?
Tables 2, 6: These tables are not easy to read. Apart from the squares drawn, I would suggest
having a first column called “Stimulus size” (large/small) and a second column called “stimulus
position” (top/bottom). Also, I would change “Reward category “large”” for “Touch-large group”
(same for the other group).
L. 238-240: They were also more likely to touch the unrewarded category when it was presented
at the bottom location, right? So, in general, they prefer searching at the bottom (as expected
by gravity).
L. 242: “the small group is better…” Isn’t this redundant within the sentence?
Tables 3, 4, 5, 7: This tables are not easy to interpret, either. Please provide more explicative
names to the files or add a legend below.
Fig.2: It would be nice to see asterisks for significance here.
L. 248-249: The other way around!
L. 250: A significant difference in what?
L. 277: More often than the top position or than the other group?
L. 285-288, 291: It would be interesting to have the training results in the main body of the text.
L. 297-299: This is confusing. What was expected then? Subjects in the large group selected the
large stimulus more when it was in the bottom position, right?
L. 302-304: I agree with that explanation.
L. 327-329: This makes sense according to gravity. The problem is how the hypothesis has been
formulated.
L. 332: That they were guessing what?
L. 374: I would not consider the training results as sideline findings, as they are key to interpret
the test results, as I have explained above. In my opinion, they deserve a place in the results
section and even a figure showing the learning curves for both groups of macaques.

neral comments:
manuscript is well written and most concepts have been comprehensively articulated. The
thodology followed in the article is satisfactorily cogent and fairly rigorous though
ifications of few subtle assumptions require clarifications.
ce, the research team didn't find support against both their hypotheses; conducting
itional alternative experiments to empirically validate some of their speculative
lanations of the results obtained or any other alternative explanations. Discussions on the
nuscript are not entirely satisfactory and require further work. To remove confounds caused
to probable motor bias of choosing stimuli at the bottom, some kind of further
eriments are suggested.
cific comments:
e 3: Why long-tailed macaque was chosen for this experiment? The rational for this need to
provided either at introduction or study model species.
e 8-13: Long sentence, can be shortened. After “……..(3,4)” sentence can separated.
e 62: Delete “this is”
e 63: rephrase the sentence from ““smaller” in this size discrimination task”, to ““smaller” in
current size discrimination task”. Delete “be able”
e 64: Size or sizes
e 82: Starting the sentence with number is not that appriciated, sentence can be started as
total of 12……”
e 113: Add coma after “vertical test,”
e 115: Delete the “the same”
e 146-147: Provide justification for chosing 18 correct trails out of 24 trails
e 153: Provide justification for using 10 cm gap between presentation of size stimuli
e 182-3: Why was the 15% size difference between the size of the 2 stimuli excluded for the

ESPONSE: We thank the Reviewer for her detailed and constructive feedback. We found it very helpful and
ope to have addressed all concerns and suggestions satisfactorily.
paper aims at analyzing the possible interaction between the position of a stimulus relative to another
ulus (i.e., above or below), and the perception of its relative size (i.e., larger or smaller than the other stimulus)
ng-tailed macaques. In particular, two hypotheses are contrasted, a “cultural” association between large
cts and high positions, and small objects and low positions, resulting from the experience with cultural aspects
the display of social hierarchies, and a naïve Aristotelian association between large objects and low positions,
small objects and high positions, resulting from the experience with gravity. The method used is a touch screen
re pairs of shapes are shown to subjects, who must select one of the two stimuli according to a previous
ing to touch the small (“small group”) or the large shape (“large group”). Two tests are carried. In the first test,
two shapes to choose from have different sizes and it is predicted that each group will perform better and
er when the target shape is higher, or lower, depending on the hypothesis. In the second test, the two shapes
similar sizes and it is expected that each group will tend to prefer the higher or the lower shape, depending on
hypothesis. The authors claim to have found some evidence for the Aristotelian hypothesis and explain some of
results based on the executive control requirements of the task.
rall, I find this paper interesting, although some aspects could be improved. My main concern has to do with
hypotheses tested. Actually, a better explanation of the hypotheses is needed in the introduction. With regard
he “cultural” hypothesis, there are many non- human species where higher-ranking individuals occupy higher
tions in trees or in rocky sleeping sites, so there is no need to invoke culture for a possible association between
rank and high locations. Actually, the authors say that chimpanzees mapped higher ranking individuals with
er locations on a touch screen (L. 26-30), and chimpanzees do not have a human-like culture. Moreover, the
ors acknowledge that writing direction contributes to the SNARC effect (L. 9-10) and, according to this, one
ld expect subjects associating low numbers to high positions and not the other way around. So, “culture” can
ntially explain any result in this test, depending on what aspects of culture we take into account. With regard
e Aristotelian hypothesis, the authors focus on gravity to explain why subjects might associate larger objects
lower positions. They say that this is “more ecologically natural” (I guess they mean “ecologically relevant”)
associating large objects with high positions because the more quantity of something, the higher the level of
something (L. 49). However, I see both explanations equally ecologically relevant, they just tap onto different
ral events (objects falling and objects accumulating). More important than that is that gravity affects any
ct equally, unrelated to size or weight. So why should subjects expect to find larger objects in lower positions?
prediction would be that subjects tend to search in lower positions always, because all objects end up in the
st position possible. By the way, this fits quite well the results obtained in this study. In sum, the authors
ld justify their hypotheses better, review the evidence from previous studies and provide information on the
ies tested, which might be relevant for the predictions and the interpretation of the results.
ESPONSE: We thank the Reviewer for bringing this up and apologize for not having been clear enough. We
hose the name “cultural” hypothesis to emphasize that more than simple physical-causal relationships play a
ole. We fully agree with the Reviewer that a preference to look for larger stimuli at the top position would not
ave implied that a human-like culture would be present. We have changed the name into “hierarchy”
ypothesis to avoid confusion. But the Reviewer raised an important point: had we found a pattern in
ccordance with the “cultural” hypothesis predictions, we could not have distinguished this from the implicit
ssociation of more quantity piling up higher, i.e., an association of more ~ higher. In case we had found a
cultural” pattern, further studies using different stimuli would be warranted to differentiate between a more ~
igher association and generic or abstract relations that would encompass, for instance, association of higher
tatus individuals with higher positions but also more generally “more of something”, such as color intensity or
ound volume, with vertical positions.

We have discussed extensively prior to data collection whether to formulate our hypothesis two-sided, that is
cknowledging that different natural events lead to contrasting outcomes (as the Reviewer points out), or one-
ided, against the background of what we found more plausible for our monkeys. Given that they rarely pile up
nd accumulate things while they frequently collect, carry and manipulate single objects, and also handle
bjects in water (where lighter objects are more likely to float while heavy objects are more likely to sink), we
ound the gravitational association more plausible. Given our a priori predictions, we feel we should present
hem in the way we have initially formulated them and not change the predictions in the light of the results.
ravity: Thank you for pointing this out. We of course agree that “gravity affects any object equally, unrelated
o size or weight”. We apologize for not having been clear enough. What we mean is the effect of gravity on
bjects with different mass. We make this more explicit now and have changed it throughout the manuscript.
revious studies: We now provide more information about the findings of the reviewed studies in the
ntroduction (lines 13-31). We also provide some general information about long-tailed macaques (lines 113-
17).
second main concern has to do with the authors’ interpretation of their results. On the one hand, they
owledge that their data do not fit any of the two hypotheses tested (L. 327, 350- 352, 409-411). On the other
d, they propose that their results can be explained by the executive control demands of the task plus monkeys
aving a bias to choose larger-sized stimuli and 2) looking for large stimuli at bottom positions. Therefore, the
ors invoke the Aristotelian hypothesis to explain their data (L. 352-355, 361-362, 395-397, 399-400, 411-413). I
ot think this is necessary. Instead, their results can be explained by the monkeys 1) having a bias towards larger
cts and 2) tending to search for any kind of stimuli at bottom positions, plus the executive control demands of
task. As acknowledged by the authors, the fact that the macaques in the small group took longer to master the
ing suggests that their task was harder. This may have resulted in them learning better to select according to
uli size, which might have made them more accurate in the case this added to the general trend towards the
om position (in the different sizes test) and less prone to select according to position only (in the similar size
.
ESPONSE: We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. This interpretation seems equally plausible to us. We
ave changed the parts in the discussion, which invoked the Aristotelian bias to explain the results.
ird concern has to do with the written English. I think this paper would profit from a revision by a native
ker.
ESPONSE: We now had a native speaker read and correct the manuscript.
w I offer some specific comments, in order throughout the manuscript:
8: A short explanation of the “SNARC effect” and the “spatial compatibility effect” is needed here. What is the
rence between them? L. 8-13: If writing direction affects the SNARC effect, how come humans categorized
er numbers and lower numbers better at the top and at the bottom of the screen, respectively, in the example
n above? This seems contradictory. Does culture really lead to a clear prediction in this respect? Also, one is left
dering what kind of mapping did non-human species in the studies cited. In brief, it would be good that the
ors revised briefly the support found in previous studies for the hypotheses tested here, both in humans and in
r species.
ESPONSE: We apologize for not having been clear enough about the spatial compatibility effects. In general,
NARC is one kind of spatial compatibility effect but there are others. For example, attention to the left or right
an be biased by presenting non-informative digits at a fixation location; similarly, when participants are asked
o dissect a line of letters in the middle, they are mostly accurate when the line consists of x-es but are biased to
he left or right when the line is a string of repeated number-words representing either high or low numbers
Reference Hubbart et al. provides a good overview). We have rephrased this in line 5-7 to make the distinction
learer. Also, one has to distinguish between the traditional SNARC effect, which is about horizontal number-
2
pace mapping, and the vertical SNARC effect (we have added this in the manuscript in 6 and 9). To our
nowledge, there are no cross-cultural studies or culture-dependent hypothesis about verticality~number
mapping in humans and we did not intend to imply there is one. We hope our modifications in the introduction
make this clearer now. We have now added more information about the kind of mapping, which occurred in the
ited non-human studies (lines 17-23 as well as 40-44.
-30: This paragraph is a bit confusing. The use of the term “cognition”, for instance, seems to vary throughout
text, including “sensorymotor components and action” sometimes (L. 14) and being considered different to
ception and action” (L. 15-16) and “mental representations” some other times (L. 20-21). More coherence is
ded.
ESPONSE: We apologize for the confusion. In this paragraph, we referred to different notions of cognition and
he architecture of cognitive processes. Specifically, we aimed to introduce the reader to the more recent (and
otentially less known) notion that cognition might involve more direct links between perception, action and
ognition (“embodied cognition”) than previously assumed: i.e., while classical theories hold that perception and
ction are separate systems that do not talk to each other directly but require abstract representations
cognition) as an in-between layer, theories of embodied cognition (or related) suggest that abstract
epresentations are not necessarily required to produce the observed actions. Such theories have been called, for
xample, to explain spatial compatibility effects or spontaneous mapping of different modalities. However, we
gree that this paragraph was a bit confusing and have rephrased it (lines 32-39).
8-56: I don’t see why the gravity explanation for large objects being associated with lower positions is more
ogically relevant than the accumulation of objects explanation for larger amounts of objects associated with
er levels.
ESPONSE: We agree with the Reviewer that different kinds of natural events lead to contrasting outcomes
egarding the possible association directions. We now provide some elaboration on our reasoning in lines 64-76
see also our response to your earlier comment).
: The use of long-tailed macaques should be justified. Why are they interesting?
ESONSE: We now provide more details on the species as well as this specific study group in the manuscript
lines 100-116). Our monkeys are part of a larger research program on comparative cognition. They are known
o be highly socially sensitive, have been tested in their social and physical cognitive abilities (e.g. gaze following,
uantity discrimination, etc.), and are used to being tested with varying setups. They are, therefore, well suited
o participate in this study.
-95: At what height was the touch-screen attached? Was it equally easy for the subjects to touch any location?
ESPONSE: The bottom and top stimulus locations were at 24 and 44 cm height from the cage ground (we now
rovide this information in the caption of Figure 1). As we describe in the manuscript in lines 438-443, the
monkeys were not restrained during testing and could reach any stimulus location equally easily, as far as we
an tell. Also, consequently, they were free to change their own position and sometimes touched the screen
while sitting, standing, or any other body orientation and position.
1-102: Where was the experimenter located? Did this have any effect on the subjects’ choices?
ESPONSE: The experimenter was standing in front of the test cage to distribute food in response to correct
ouches. We do not see how this could have affected the monkeys’ responses differently in the different
onditions. We added this information in the manuscript (line 167-169).
3
0: Change “had to” tor “were rewarded for”.
ESPONSE: we changed accordingly.
11-113: I suggest changing “large group” to “touch-large group”, and “small group” to “touch-small group”.
erwise, these names evoke the size of the group, not the size of the rewarded stimulus.
ESPONSE: We have changed the names as suggested and now refer to “Touch-Large group” and “Touch-Small
roup” throughout the manuscript.
13-115: I suggest changing the name “Vertical test” to “Different-size test” and “Vertical same size test” to
me-size test” since, unlike the training, both tests are vertical and the main difference between them is the
ive size of the stimuli. This would be easier to read.
ESPONSE: We changed the names as suggested.
5-118: The predictions for each hypothesis should be stated more clearly, perhaps in a table.
ESPONSE: We now provide a table with the predictions.
7-142: Wasn’t there a starting touch in the familiarization phase? What if there were two touches at the same
, or a second touch? How long did it take for subjects to learn to touch one shape reliably? What does
ably” mean here?
ESPONSE: The familiarization phase had no start sign. It was really a first familiarization with the setup and
ouchscreen in general. As such, we had also not included any “hard criterion”, which the individuals had to
each in order to begin with the actual training. It was quite unsystematic and could look different for different
ndividuals, depending on individual’s needs, as assessed by the experimenter (who had worked with these
monkeys before). For example, it could even involve having two monkeys in the test area at the same time to use
ne as a model for the other, in case a monkey was reluctant to approach the screen. Thus, we cannot provide
meaningful information about “how long it took for subjects to learn to touch one shape reliably”. If the
eviewer insists, we could provide information about the number of test slots for each monkey. However, we
ave no information what exactly happened in the test slots (including, for example, their duration, presence of
ther monkeys, number of stimuli touched by the subject) and, therefore, feel that this would not be very
nformative. We are confident that the experimenter could judge well whether a monkey was “ready” to begin
with the horizontal training and that this decision procedure did not lead to systematic biases, despite the
bsence of an objective criterion. We have added information in lines 159-163.
When two touches occurred simultaneously, only the first was registered.
4-145: I suggest changing “reward category” to “group (i.e., touch-large or touch-small)”, it is clearer.
ESPONSE: We have changed this as suggested.
5-147: Specify how many shapes were there in each stage. Change “learning criterion” to “success criterion”. I
ld move this information to the beginning of the next paragraph.
ESPONSE: We have added this information in lines 192-194 and changed the naming as suggested.
0: Were the positions fully random or was there a restriction in the number of times that, e.g., the large shape
d appear in a given position?
4
ESPONSE: We applied a semi-randomized stimulus presentation such that each stimulus category appeared
qually often on each location. We have added this information in line 180-182.
1: What was the maximum number of trials in each phase? And in total?
ESPONSE: We now provide the number of sessions of the horizontal training stages here (lines 268, 292, and
12).
8-169: I would move this information to the beginning of the previous paragraph. L. 169-176: I would add this
rmation at the end of the previous paragraph.
ESPONSE: We have made the suggested changes.
77: See my previous comment about the tests’ names. “Vertical test” is uninformative, since both tests are
cal.
ESPONSE: We have changed the names accordingly.
1-183: So, subjects in the “large group” were better at discriminating their rewarded stimulus. This could be
use selecting the large stimulus is easier but could also reflect that there were “smarter” individuals in that
p. How were the groups formed, randomly?
ESPONSE: Yes, the individuals were assigned to the groups randomly. Given their motivation and performance
n other studies, we do not have reason to believe that more clever individuals ended up accidentally in the large
roup. We now say so explicitly here (line 141-142)
1: I find it hard to understand “Reward category” at first sight. “Target size” would be much better.
ESPONSE: We have changed this accordingly.
3: I think a first main focus should be on the horizontal training: do long-tailed macaques learn better/faster to
ct larger or smaller objects? (A second main focus should have been a vertical, same-size test, to respond to the
tion: do long-tailed macaques prefer selecting higher or lower positions? Unfortunately, this was not done).
n would come the tests: do long-tailed macaques search preferentially in higher or lower positions depending
hether they search for large or small objects?
ESPONSE: We have moved the main results of the horizontal training to the main manuscript and now provide
dditional information regarding detailed model output and learning curves in the supplementary material.
3-216: What predictions did the authors have? L. 217-118: I do not understand this.
ESPONSE: We apologize for not having been clear enough here. The predictions refer to the horizontal number-
pace mappings found in some studies with chicken, macaques and humans that we introduce in the
ntroduction (left~small numbers, right~large numbers). However, we have removed this sentence because we
eel it distracts from the main point (differences of effect of vertical position on target touches between Touch-
arge and Touch-Small group).
4: The results of the training should be shown before the test, since they are relevant for the discussion. Also,
my previous comments regarding the tests’ names.
5
ESPONSE: We have moved the horizontal training results to the main manuscript.
5-228: That is the prediction for the gravity hypothesis. What about the “cultural” hypothesis?
ESPONSE: We rephrased this. We now say “In the different-size test, we were interested in effects of vertical
timulus position on task performance as a function of target-size group (Touch-Large or Touch-small group).”
es 2, 6: These tables are not easy to read. Apart from the squares drawn, I would suggest having a first column
d “Stimulus size” (large/small) and a second column called “stimulus position” (top/bottom). Also, I would
ge “Reward category “large”” for “Touch-large group” (same for the other group).
ESPONSE: Thank you for this suggestion. We have re-arranged the tables and hope they are better readable
ow.
38-240: They were also more likely to touch the unrewarded category when it was presented at the bottom
tion, right? So, in general, they prefer searching at the bottom (as expected by gravity).
ESPONSE: The monkeys touched the unrewarded category at chance when it was presented at the bottom
large group: 51%, small group: 49%, see table 2). We apologize that our tables were hard to read and made the
uggested adjustments.
2: “the small group is better...” Isn’t this redundant within the sentence?
ESPONSE: We mean that the small group is better than the large group to touch their target when the target is
resented at the bottom location. We rephrased this accordingly (line 340-343).
es 3, 4, 5, 7: This tables are not easy to interpret, either. Please provide more explicative names to the files or
a legend below.
ESPONSE: We added more explicit information about the reference categories to the tables.
: It would be nice to see asterisks for significance here.
ESPONSE: We have removed the figure, as suggested by Reviewer 2, as the information was redundant with
able 4.
8-249: The other way around!
ESPONSE: Thank you for spotting this, we changed accordingly.
0: A significant difference in what?
ESPONSE: We refer to difference in reaction time and have added accordingly “ … in reaction time”.
7: More often than the top position or than the other group?
ESPONSE: We refer to the difference to the Touch-Small group and have added this accordingly “… than
ndividuals of the Touch-Small group”.
6
5-288, 291: It would be interesting to have the training results in the main body of the text.
ESPONSE: We have moved the results as suggested.
7-299: This is confusing. What was expected then? Subjects in the large group selected the large stimulus more
n it was in the bottom position, right?
ESPONSE: What we mean is that individuals of the large group should have been even more accurate than 67%
when their target (which was supposedly the easier of the two reward categories) was presented at the
ntrinsically preferred bottom position. We added this in line 398-401.
2-304: I agree with that explanation. L. 327-329: This makes sense according to gravity. The problem is how
hypothesis has been formulated. L. 332: That they were guessing what?
ESPONSE: We mean that they were guessing randomly as opposed to responding according to their learned
eward scheme.
4: I would not consider the training results as sideline findings, as they are key to interpret the test results, as I
explained above. In my opinion, they deserve a place in the results section and even a figure showing the
ning curves for both groups of macaques.
ESPONSE: We have removed “sideline findings” and now present the horizontal training results in the main
manuscript. We provide learning curves in the horizontal training stages in the supplementary material.

eral comments: The manuscript is well written and most concepts have been comprehensively articulated. The
hodology followed in the article is satisfactorily cogent and fairly rigorous though justifications of few subtle
mptions require clarifications.
ESPONSE: We thank the Reviewer for this general positive evaluation of our work.
e, the research team didn't find support against both their hypotheses; conducting additional alternative
riments to empirically validate some of their speculative explanations of the results obtained or any other
native explanations. Discussions on the manuscript are not entirely satisfactory and require further work. To
ove confounds caused due to probable motor bias of choosing stimuli at the bottom, some kind of further
riments are suggested.
ESPONSE: Unfortunately, resources in the Lab do not allow for further follow-ups as the monkeys are involved
n different studies, now. We agree it would be interesting to address the issues in more depths and we will come
ack to this question (and would be happy to see others doing so, as well). However, we have rephrased and
laborated on parts of the discussion and re-structured the manuscript according to the suggestions of Reviewer
. We hope this improved the manuscript satisfactorily.
ific comments: Line 3: Why long-tailed macaque was chosen for this experiment? The rational for this need to
rovided either at introduction or study model species.
ESONSE: We now provide more details on the species as well as this specific study group in the manuscript
lines 100-116.) Our monkeys are part of a larger research program on comparative cognition. They are known
o be highly socially sensitive, have been tested in their social and physical cognitive abilities (e.g. gaze following,
7
uantity discrimination, etc.), and are used to being tested with varying setups. They are, therefore, well suited
o participate in this study.
8-13: Long sentence, can be shortened.
ESPSONSE: We have rephrased the sentence.
r “........(3,4)” sentence can separated. Line 62: Delete “this is”
ESPSONSE: We have made these changes.
63: rephrase the sentence from ““smaller” in this size discrimination task”, to ““smaller” in the current size
imination task”. Delete “be able” Line 64: Size or sizes Line 82: Starting the sentence with number is not that
iciated, sentence can be started as “A total of 12......” Line 113: Add coma after “vertical test,” Line 115:
te the “the same”
ESPSONSE: We have made all these changes.
146-147: Provide justification for chosing 18 correct trails out of 24 trails
ESPSONSE: We have added information in line 196-198, saying “We chose this learning criterion of 75 % to
nsure that individuals had understood the task well but were not performing at ceiling, in order to allow for
otential spatial-bias effects to manifest in the test.”
153: Provide justification for using 10 cm gap between presentation of size stimuli
ESPSONSE: This distance assured that responsive areas of two stimuli in vertical and horizontal axis didn’t
verlap. We now say so in line 183-184.
182-3: Why was the 15% size difference between the size of the 2 stimuli excluded for the 'small' group?
ESPSONSE: It was not necessary to make the task more difficult for the Touch-small group individuals (i.e., to
educe the size difference to 15%) because none of them performed at ceiling as some of the Touch-large group
ndividuals did. We have added this in line 218-219.
192-3: Why was reminding necessary when successful training has already ensured it?
ESPSONSE: As our monkeys participate on a voluntary basis, we cannot ensure daily participation. Thus, there
were sometimes longer breaks between sessions and, therefore, we decided to include these reminder trials for
ll of them. We have added a sentence to clarify this in the manuscript now (lines 229-232).
237: Final effect size (with CI) of the marginal difference can be computed for accuracy
ESPSONSE: We now provide confidence intervals for individual predictors as well as conditional R2 effect sizes
or those full models, which were different from their respective null models.
238: Replace “target position” with the variable name, 'location of target' for better comprehension
ESPSONSE: We replaced this as suggested.
8
245: In formation of the figure can be incorporated to table-3
ESPSONSE: We agree with the Reviewer that Figure and Table 3 contain redundant information and have
emoved the figure.
297-9: The sentence is incomplete Line 310-312: No clarity in the sentence?
ESPSONSE: We have rephrased these parts.

Appendix D
Reviewer: 1
General comments:
The manuscript has improved substantially since the previous version. The theoretical background is
clearer and a table has been added with the predictions of the different hypotheses. Also, the
description of the methods is more complete and the interpretation of the results is sounder. In
addition, the new names for the hypothesis, the groups and the tests, plus the English revision, make
he manuscript easier to read. I still have, however, some concerns about the two hypotheses tested:
Expecting larger objects above smaller objects: In their responses to my comments, the authors
mention that monkeys rarely pile up objects, so the idea of monkeys associating high positions with
arge objects based on quantity does not seem plausible to them. I agree with that. They instead give
he hierarchy explanation, where higher-ranking individuals occupy higher spots than lower-ranking
ndividuals. However, it would be good that the authors mentioned whether this is the case in long-
ailed macaques, since not all species behave in that way. If this were not the case of the macaques,
calling this “hierarchy” hypothesis would not be justified. Moreover, in this case there would be no
basis, either physical or social, for this hypothesis and the authors should perhaps consider the
possibility of removing it. If they still preferred to keep it “not to change the predictions in the light of
he results” (which I understand and share), they should try to find a way to justify it and give more
weight to the gravity hypothesis.
We would like to thank the Reviewer again for her detailed, helpful and constructive feedback.
We have added reference to observational findings in wild long-tailed macaques on p. 4: “While
we are not aware of a similar experiment with long-tailed macaques (the species studied in this
paper), observations of locomotive behavior of long-tailed macaques in the wild indicate that
males – who are higher ranking than females – usually occupy higher vertical positions in trees
unless they are following females during mating season, in which case they can be found in lower
heights (26, and Girard-Buttoz personal communication)”
Expecting larger objects below smaller objects: When they explain this hypothesis, the authors now
efer to mass instead of weight. Since their hypothesis refers to the Aristotelian (naïve) concept of
gravity, however, I think talking about weight is preferable, since what we sense is weight, not mass,
o we make our judgements upon weight. Most importantly, the authors need to explain better why
his expectation is Aristotelian. I think the problem may come from the examples given (the bending
branch and the floating objects), which are totally valid nowadays and do not correspond to a naïve
dea of gravity (see my specific comments below). This is relevant, since the validity of the
hypothesis’ name (and the title of the paper) depends on the authors being able to explain this.
<U+F02D> We now emphasize weight rather than mass.
<U+F02D> On p. 5, we now additionally explain “This notion equals naïve early physical theories on
mass, most famously Aristotle’s view on object movements (31). In his classic work "De
Caelo" ("On the heavens", 32), Aristoteles laid out his intuitive understanding of gravity.
He claimed that every object strives to its natural place, with heavy, earthy objects striving
to lower places and light, aerial objects striving to the top. Specifically, his notion is that
the more “earth” element, the more solid substance, an object has, the lower it goes. Since
the amount of substance correlates with the size of an object, we call the association
larger-bottom and smaller-top an intuitive Aristotelian view.”
<U+F02D> We have removed the floating on water example.
Below I offer some specific comments:
1
L. 2-16: The abstract needs to be revised. There is no mention to the methods used (touch-screen
ask, training to touch one of two shapes of different sizes), so when the results are reported they
cannot be understood. Also, the “naïve physics” interpretation of the results does not fit very well
with the discussion of the results in the present version of the manuscript.
Thank you for pointing this out. We agree and made adjustments.
L. 32-36: I suggest moving this text to the end of the previous paragraph.
L. 36-44: I suggest moving this text to the beginning of the next paragraph.
We did as suggested.
L. 45-47: I suggest removing this sentence, since it is redundant with L. 56-59.
L. 48-55: Since size is related to quantity, I would recommend moving this somewhere after talking
about numbers and quantities but before talking about hierarchy.
We restructured this paragraph.
L. 66: Remove “due to their mass”.
L. 67: Change “on the ground” to “closer to the ground”.
L. 68-71: Consider removing this text. I would not involve culture here, nor hierarchy, and would go
directly to the examples. With regard to the water example, the authors should also refer to the
object’s size and not only to its weight, since they are trying to explain the association between size
and position, not weight and position.
Nevertheless, note that these examples do not necessarily correspond to naïve physical theories, and
particularly to Aristotle’s ideas, which revolved mainly on free-falling objects, as far as I know (some
eferences are needed on this point): Actually, larger objects are heavier than smaller objects of the
ame kind and therefore exert more tension on the object they hang from (the branch), or more
pressure on the object on which they stand (the water), thus getting closer to the ground. Therefore,
maybe these are not the best examples here, or a better explanation of why Aristotle is invoked is
needed!
L. 77: Change “locations” to “arrangements” and ·target” to “two”.
L. 80: Eliminate “vertical” and add “(top vs bottom)” instead.
L. 88: Add a comma after “representation”.
L. 93: Change “they” to “the monkeys”.
We changed as suggested.
L. 95: Add the evolutionary implications of this second hypothesis as well.
On p. 7 we added “This would imply that at some point in evolutionary history such pragmatic
associations were complemented with or replaced by a hierarchical representation.”
L. 110: Change “was” to “were”.
L. 113: Add “in the wild” after “macaques”.
L. 140: Remove “also”.
L. 143: Add a prediction for the different-size test.
L. 146-147: Move “-and viceversa…” to after “position”.
We changed as suggested.
L. 183-184: Isn’t this redundant with L. 181?
2
Yes, we removed this sentence.
L. 223-224: Appearing 4 times in each position or in total?
The information refers to 4 times in each position in total. We have added this in the manuscript
on p 13.
L. 260: Remove comma after “models”.
L. 268: Move “Stage 1” to the next line.
L. 368: Add “in” before “which”.
L. 415: Add “in knowing” before “if”.
We changed as suggested.
L. 432: Do the authors want to involve culture here?
We removed “cultural” in the sentence.
L. 435: Add “more” after “strive”.
L. 437: Add “more” after “stimulus”.
We changed as suggested.
L. 459-460: I miss references to inhibitory control studies that used the “reversed-contingency task”
based on size.
We added references to the reversed-contingency task on p. 25, saying: “We had not expected
that the difference between the two groups would be as pronounced, although several studies had
reported a preference for larger food quantities and accompanying difficulties to solve reverse-
contingency tasks (where the individual has to choose the smaller quantity in order to receive the
larger quantity) (see 41 for the role of item size and quantity on choice behaviour in
chimpanzees).”
L. 485: I would avoid talking about “excellent understanding” and would rather use “excellent
performance” or something similar.
L. 511: Not only “in which direction” stimulus size is associated with vertical position but also
“whether” there is such an association!
We changed as suggested.
Reviewer: 2
Authors have made substantial improvement and addressed all the issues raised, yet few minor
corrections need be fixed.
Line 359-360: written P=.002: what is significance level fixed, if this is a typo mistake that needs to be
ixed.
Line 387-388: written P.437: writing style of the result?
Please check the writing style of the results in the entire MS.
Thank you for spotting these. We have corrected the typos and made formatting adjustments
throughout.
