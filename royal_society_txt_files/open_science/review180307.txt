Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In this study, the author investigated the permeability, mass loss and pore pressure of crushed
gangue during the seepage under different axial load level by the self-designed test system.
Some meaningful research results are obtained. Before this study, the seepage test system of
crushed rock can only test the pore pressure at the seepage entrance and outlet, and the
researchers usually assume the pore pressure in the crushed rock distributes linearly along the
seepage direction. In this paper, the author designed a test system, which can obtain the inner
pore pressure along the seepage height. So I think this paper has done an innovative study, but
its English expression needs much improvement and modification. Some Figures are not very
clear, which needs to be modified. I have made some marks in red pencil as shown in the
attached document. In general, I think this manuscript can be accepted with major revision.
Some questions and mistakes in this manuscript are as follows:
(1) Formula (2) is wrong, a negative sign is redundant in its right side;
(2) The expression of porosity in Formula (4) and (5) in not same;
(3) In this paper, the calculation of the effective stress is not explained;
(4) In Fig 7(b), the ordinate ß has no unit.
(5) In Table 1, the permeability k has wrong unit, the non-Darcy factor ß has no unit.
(6) The font of Formula (5) is wrong.

18-Apr-2018
Dear Dr Liu,
The editors assigned to your paper ("Pore pressure evolution and mass loss of broken gangue
during the seepage") have now received comments from reviewers. We would like you to revise
your paper in accordance with the referee and Associate Editor suggestions which can be found
below (not including confidential reports to the Editor). Please note this decision does not
guarantee eventual acceptance. I am particularly concerned about the possible errors in some of
the equations presented, as suggested by one reviewer. Please ensure that these equations are
checked thoroughly in order that readers of your paper will be able to use the equations
themselves.
Please submit a copy of your revised paper within three weeks (i.e. by the 11-May-2018). If we do
not hear from you within this time then it will be assumed that the paper has been withdrawn. In
exceptional circumstances, extensions may be possible if agreed with the Editorial Office in
advance.We do not allow multiple rounds of revision so we urge you to make every effort to
fully address all of the comments at this stage. If deemed necessary by the Editors, your
manuscript will be sent back to one or more of the original reviewers for assessment. If the
original reviewers are not available, we may invite new reviewers.

supplementary information or preferably in a suitable permanent repository. The data
accessibility section should state where the article's supporting data can be accessed. This section
should also include details, where possible of where to access other relevant research materials
such as statistical tools, protocols, software etc can be accessed. If the data have been deposited in
an external repository this section should list the database, accession number and link to the DOI

The authors have made some modifications according to the reviewer’s suggestions, but the
revised manuscript still has some points needed to be modified.
1. In general, the normal stress is expressed with s, so the total axial stress is suggested to
express with s, and effective stress with .
2. In Table 1 of page 28 the unit of “particle size” is mm, which should be added behind “particle
size”, and at the same time “2.5-5.0mm”, “5.0-8.0mm”, and et al, here “mm” is not needed.
3. In page 4 line 36, the unit of the gangue density is wrong ,it should be <U+03C1>s =2.32×103 kg/m3

Appendix A
This article investigated the permeability parameters, pore pressure and mass loss of
broken gangue by the seepage test system, considering the influence factors of
effective stress and particle sizes. The results have a certain reference value to
practice. About the experiments, there are several comments.
1<U+3001>There are a lot of problems in full text editing. Please check it carefully.
Especially missing the important words, such as “effective” was missed the “stress” in
page 5 line11, it is “of” not “df ” in Fig.7, the expression of “ 0.28 kg, 0.27 kg, 0.25
kg, 0.14 kg, 0.12 kg” in test is not consistent which in the Table 3, and so on.
2<U+3001>In section 2.1, the first line there are two “water pressure”. And the “pore water”
should be “pore water pressure” or “pore pressure”, they are different. Please check
them.
3<U+3001>In page 3, line 13, it is better seen in Fig.3, not Fig.2. And, in line 15, it is better
seen in Fig.2, not Fig.3.
4<U+3001>The broken gangue was sieved into 5 groups, when seepage, the sample was
single diameter, this is far from the actual rock mass, why not measure the mixed
gangue by the 5 groups by a certain proportion?
5<U+3001>Is it the oil pressure or pore water pressure that mentioned 1MPa,
2MPa,3MPa,3.5MPa in page 4, line 3. In fact, the pore water pressure is more
concerned. And what is the relationship between the oil pressure and pore water
pressure?
6<U+3001>The f in formula (4) is different from the <U+03D5> in the below explaining, please
check them.
7<U+3001>The unit of k is m2, but it was given different units in Fig.7(a) and Table 1. And
the unit of ß in Table 1 is m-1.
8<U+3001>In fig.8, the axial pressure is not the axial force, so the unit should not be KN.
9<U+3001>In section 3.4, the author only listed the lost mass simply, but not the mass loss
rate, they are two different concepts, so it is best to change the title of 3.4.
Appendix B
Dear editor,
I have revised the manuscript, and did careful modification.
For reviewer 1:
(1) I revised the Formula (2). The negative sign was deleted.
(2) The expression of porosity in Formula (4) and (5) changed to the same.
(3) the calculation of the effective stress is obtained for Formula (6)
(4) In Fig 7(b), the unit of ßis given.
(5) In Table 1, the unit of permeability k is given, the unit of non-Darcy factor ß is
given.
(6) The font of Formula (5) was changed.
For reviewer 2:
(1) Effective stress is added in page 5 line11, I changed the “df” into “of” in Fig.7, the
expression of “ 0.28 kg, 0.25 kg,0.27 kg, 0.14 kg, 0.12 kg” in test was changed to be
consistent with the expression which showed in the Table 3.
(2) In section 2.1, pore water was changed into pore water pressure.
(3) In page 3, Fig.2 was changed into Fig.3 in line 13, Fig. 3 was changed into Fig.2 in
line 15.
(4) During the seepage, the different particle size has different permeability, I think it
is important to analyze the single influence for each one. And the mixed gangue of
different particle size will be discussed later.
(5) The oil pressure is the same with water pressure, so the oil pressure is 1MPa, 2MPa,
3MPa, 3.5MPa in page 4, and water pressure is the same.
(6) The was used to express the porosity of the broken gangue.
(7) In Fig.7(a) and Table 1, The units of k and ß are changed into m-2 and m-1,
respectively.
(8) I changed the unit of axial pressure.
(9) I changed the mass rate into mass.
Best Wishes!
