I found this manuscript easy to read and the conclusion is well-supported by the data and
analysis.
Minor issues needed to be corrected are listed as follows:
1. The author states in the abstract that they found an approximate formula between the
switchover time and the concentration of the reactants and the rate coefficient of the slow
reaction. The analysis has however been performed in dimensionless form. It would also be
proper to see this formula directly like in case of a Landolt reaction (see: A. K. Horvath et al, J.
Phys. Chem. A, 2008, 112, 7868.) This would be helpful and useful for a general reader who is
rather a chemist than a mathematician.
2. Page 2, line 6 from bottom: the term "iodine-thiosulfate system" used is certainly incorrect
because this is a very rapid reaction. This system the authors would have wanted to refer is the
iodide-peroxydisulfate system in presence of thiosulfate.
3. Page 11, last sentence prior to discussion: k_AB is a rate constant of a second order reaction as
shown in eq. (1.2) therefore its unit has to be M^{-1}s$^{-1}$ instead of s^{-1}. It definitely has to
be corrected.
4. It has to be mentioned somewhere in the paper that hydrogen-peroxide is used in a huge
3
excess compared to iodine an iodide. This will allow to use eq. (1.2) as is, otherwise the
concentration of hydrogen-peroxide has to be included in the rate equation.
5. It is also important to know the exact concentration of H2O2 in order to check the validity of
data in Table 1a and 1b. This info in terms of molarity has to be given somewhere in the article.
My final evaluation is therefore that this manuscript requires a minor revisions prior to
acceptance.

Clock reactions are of general interest in teaching kinetics and in some research applications.
Here a mathematical analysis is undertaken of the basic mechanism of an inhibitor clock reaction
resulting in a simple expression for clock times, or switchover times, that are compared to
experimental results with the Vitamin C clock reaction.
I have some points for consideration before publication:
It would be clearer if the rate constants subscripts were the reaction number eg k2 or k1.2 rather
than kAB and kBA.
It is not mentioned, but in 1.2 why are you are assuming acid is constant, or that rate is
independent of acid? What is the source of H+ once all the vitamin C is consumed?
Figure 1. (b) and (c) are indicated as showing close-ups, but the scale is the same on the x axis, it
looks like more vectors have been added. Why are they smaller in magnitude at the same
position in (a)?
Pg10 (f) mentions phi = iodate:iodine ratio but this is the iodine I2 to to total iodine atoms (I- +
I2). The discussion also includes conversion of iodine to iodate. I think iodide (I-) is meant instead
of iodate (IO3-).
Pg 11. Misleading to say all initial iodine molecules are dissociated. In lugol’s reagent iodine
mainly reacts with iodide to form triiodide I3- (source of I2). However, you prepare a solution A
with vitamin C and lugol’s so you are assuming the reaction with vitamin C and the iodine in
4
lugol’s has occurred producing hydrogen ion and iodide?
Perhaps best to write iodine atoms for total iodine to distinguish from iodine molecules – then it
is 2.5289 g /100 ml of iodine atoms in the experimental section (not iodine (I2)).
Why are concentrations are calculated based on 5 ml starch? It is added as 1 teaspoon powder so
shouldn’t affect the volume.

Appendix A
The manuscript ‘Mathematical modelling of the vitamin C clock reaction’ by Kerr, Thomson, and
Smith, RSOS-181367, is a very interesting study on the mathematical modeling of chemical
eactions, specially for clock reactions. The study is deep and explore several aspects of the
mathematical modeling of chemical reactions. The mathematical concepts looks correct. However,
he manuscript has a problem with the rate law of the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and
odide, equation (1.2). The chemical reaction
2H+ + 2I- + H2O2 ÿ I2 + 2H2O (1.1)
has a well established rate law*
rate = k[I-][H2O2] (in buffered media)
-
rate = k[I ][H2O2] + kN[I- ][H2O2][H+ ] (considering the acid catalysis)
n this way, the rate law indicated by eq (1.2)
rate = k[I-]2
cannot be accepted, which turns the mathematical work on this reaction unrealistic.
As an additional comment, I suggest that, at discretion of the authors, in the Introduction section,
he work by G. Lente, G. Bazsa, and I. Fabian (What is and what isn't a clock reaction? New J.
Chem. 31:1707, 2007) should be cited and discussed because the definition of a clock reaction is
not settled completely yet.

Response to reviewers’ comments
Ryan Kerr, William Thomson and David Smith
January 26, 2019
We thank the reviewers for their careful reading of the manuscript and thought-provoking
comments, and we thank the editors for the opportunity to submit a revised manuscript.
The query of reviewer 1 regarding the correct rate law for the forward reaction was the
most significant issue to address, and it prompted us to review the model and relevant
iterature carefully. We have responded below in detail to this query, which we believe we
can address, and to all other issues raised (reviewers comments in italics, our responses
n roman).
1 Reviewer 1
The manuscript Mathematical modelling of the vitamin C clock reaction by Kerr, Thom-
son, and Smith, RSOS-181367, is a very interesting study on the mathematical modeling
of chemical reactions, specially for clock reactions. The study is deep and explore several
aspects of the mathematical modeling of chemical reactions. The mathematical concepts
ooks correct.
However, the manuscript has a problem with the rate law of the reaction between hydrogen
peroxide and iodide, equation (1.2). The chemical reaction
2H + + 2I - + H2 O2 <U+2192> I2 + 2H2 O (1)
has a well established rate law1,2,3
rate = k[I - ][H2 O2 ] (in buffered media)
rate = k[I - ][H2 O2 ] + kN [I - ][H2 O2 ][H + ] (considering the acid catalysis)
n this way, the rate law indicated by eq (1.2)
rate = k[I - ]2
cannot be accepted, which turns the mathematical work on this reaction unrealistic.
1
This is a significant and thought-provoking comment which, along with Reviewer 2’s
queries regarding the hydrogen peroxide concentration, led us to re-evaluate the model.
n view of the cited references, we re-worked the calculation using the linear rate law
ndicated above. The asymptotics are fairly similar with a few details of the solutions
changed. The key difference is that expression for the switchover time under linear kinetics
s of the form,
tsw <U+221D> m-1
0 ,
as compared with our submitted model tsw <U+221D> m-2 0 .
Taking a log-log plot of the experimental data series with m0 varying results in a gradient
of approximately -2.3, which is much closer to the initial model, moreover while the
nitial model fits our experimental data well, the new model does not, as shown below
(best one-parameter fit for k0 across two data series simultaneously):
500
250
200 400
150 300
100 200
50 100
0 0
0 2 4 6 2 4 6 8 10 12 14
-3 -3
10 10
We believe the reason that the original model works better than the suggested linear law
s that in our experiments there is a great excess of hydrogen peroxide in our experiment
(0.09 mol/l as compared with 0.001–0.006 mol/l vitamin C – we have now included this
detail in section 5). This excess ensures that the rate-limiting step (nucleophilic attack of
I - upon the H2 O2 in equation (4) of Copper and Koubek, 1998) underlying the linear rate
aws is no longer rate-limiting, and the reaction can instead by modelled by a quadratic
aw. By contrast, references1,2,3 worked with concentrations of H2 O2 which are much
closer to those of the other substrates.
We therefore believe that (without undertaking a much more complex model involving
multiple reaction steps) the original rate law of k0 [I - ]2 provides a suitable approximation
which is validated by our experiments. We have however modified the introduction (after
equation 1.1) to include the suggested references and to clarify our reasoning for taking
the quadratic rate law, and moreover have reported the value of the hydrogen peroxide
concentration in section 5 (4th paragraph).
As an additional comment, I suggest that, at discretion of the authors, in the Introduc-
ion section, the work by G. Lente, G. Bazsa, and I. Fabian (What is and what isn’t a
clock reaction? New J. Chem. 31:1707, 2007) should be cited and discussed because the
definition of a clock reaction is not settled completely yet.
Thank you for the suggestion – we now refer to this work at the end of the fourth para-
graph of the introduction (following the comments about autocatalysis), and in the last
paragraph of the introduction (highlighting that the reaction we consider fits the strict
2
definition of clock reaction given by Lente et al.)

2 Reviewer 2
found this manuscript easy to read and the conclusion is well-supported by the data and
analysis. Minor issues needed to be corrected are listed as follows:
1. The author states in the abstract that they found an approximate formula between
the switchover time and the concentration of the reactants and the rate coefficient of
the slow reaction. The analysis has however been performed in dimensionless form.
It would also be proper to see this formula directly like in case of a Landolt reaction
(see: A. K. Horvath et al, J. Phys. Chem. A, 2008, 112, 7868.) This would be
helpful and useful for a general reader who is rather a chemist than a mathematician.
We have now reported the dimensional form of the switchover time result explicitly
in terms of chemical concentrations in equation (6.1) in the discussion, in a similar
form to Horva´th et al.
2. Page 2, line 6 from bottom: the term “iodine-thiosulfate system” used is certainly
incorrect because this is a very rapid reaction. This system the authors would have
wanted to refer is the iodide-peroxydisulfate system in presence of thiosulfate.
Thank you for identifying this error, we have corrected (last paragraph of section
1) as suggested.
3. Page 11, last sentence prior to discussion: kAB is a rate constant of a second order
reaction as shown in eq. (1.2) therefore its unit has to be M -1 s-1 instead of s-1 . It
definitely has to be corrected.
Thank you – corrected.
4. It has to be mentioned somewhere in the paper that hydrogen-peroxide is used in
a huge excess compared to iodine an iodide. This will allow to use eq. (1.2) as
is, otherwise the concentration of hydrogen-peroxide has to be included in the rate
equation.
3
Agreed – we have added comments about this isue before equation (1.2) (please
see also the detailed response to Reviewer 1’s query about the rate law above and
response to the next comment).
5. It is also important to know the exact concentration of H2O2 in order to check the
validity of data in Table 1a and 1b. This info in terms of molarity has to be given
somewhere in the article.
This concentration is now given in the last but one paragraph of section 5. The
quantity is 0.09 mol/l, which is indeed an order of magnitude greater than c0 and
m0 .

Clock reactions are of general interest in teaching kinetics and in some research applica-
ions. Here a mathematical analysis is undertaken of the basic mechanism of an inhibitor
clock reaction resulting in a simple expression for clock times, or switchover times, that
are compared to experimental results with the Vitamin C clock reaction. I have some
points for consideration before publication:
• It would be clearer if the rate constants subscripts were the reaction number e.g. k2
or k1.2 rather than kAB and kBA .
We have considered this suggestion and have taken on board as follows: a numbered
scheme as been used as suggested, with the nomenclature k0 for the forward reaction
(formerly kAB ) and k1 for the backward reaction (formerly kBA ), consistent with
Billingham and Needham, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. (1992) 340, 569–591, section 3.
• It is not mentioned, but in 1.2 why are you are assuming acid is constant, or that
rate is independent of acid? What is the source of H+ once all the vitamin C is
consumed?
We have assumed that the production of H + by reaction 1.2 at the same rate as I -
ensures that there is then sufficient H + available for reaction 1.1 to proceed once
the vitamin C is consumed. A brief note has been added before equation 1.3 to this
effect.
• Figure 1. (b) and (c) are indicated as showing close-ups, but the scale is the same
on the x axis, it looks like more vectors have been added. Why are they smaller in
magnitude at the same position in (a)?
Good point! Figure 1 (b) and (c) additionally use a rescaling for the arrows, which
results in arrows which are very small in (a) appearing visible – we have added a

• Pg10 (f ) mentions phi = iodate:iodine ratio but this is the iodine I2 to to total iodine
atoms (I- + I2). The discussion also includes conversion of iodine to iodate. I think
iodide (I-) is meant instead of iodate (IO3-).
Agreed – we have corrected this in both page 10 (f) and also the discussion.

• Pg 11. Misleading to say all initial iodine molecules are dissociated. In lugols reagent
iodine mainly reacts with iodide to form triiodide I3- (source of I2). However, you
prepare a solution A with vitamin C and lugols so you are assuming the reaction
with vitamin C and the iodine in lugols has occurred producing hydrogen ion and
iodide?
This comment led us to revise the data analysis. We now agree that we cannot a
priori assume that the iodine is dissociated initially. We do however wish to base
the value of f on the molecular iodine proportion before the reaction with vitamin
C starts, and given that the equilibrium dynamics of iodine/iodide in Lugol’s is
beyond the scope of the paper, we decided instead to take f as a free parameter.
Hence the fitting process now finds both k0 and f.
Interestingly, the optimal value of f from an unconstrained optimization is smaller
than 10-4 , suggesting that the initial proportion of molecular iodine is very small.
We have hence modified the abstract (no longer referring to a ‘single-parameter
fit’), have modified the statements regarding the value of f in the third paragraph
of section 5, added the fitted value of f to the last paragraph of section 5 and caption
of figure 5, and modified the second paragraph of the discussion.
• Perhaps best to write iodine atoms for total iodine to distinguish from iodine molecules
then it is 2.5289 g /100 ml of iodine atoms in the experimental section (not iodine
(I2)).
In this case (measuring g/ml rather than mol/l) we believe the distinction between
atoms and molecules isn’t necessary, as two atoms of iodine will have (virtually) the
same mass as one molecule of I2 – therefore we haven’t made a change.
• Why are concentrations are calculated based on 5 ml starch? It is added as 1 teaspoon
powder so shouldn’t affect the volume.
We agree with the reviewer and have removed the 5 ml of liquid starch from the
calculation. This slightly alters the concentration values and hence table 1, figure 5
and the fitted value of k0 have been updated (the latter changes from 0.59 to 0.57).
4 Other changes
On revising the manuscript we have made a small number of minor corrections/clarifications
to the mathematical arguments, listed below:
• Typographical error: equation (4.7) was missing an  in front of the left hand side
term. This has been corrected.
• We have corrected and clarified the argument around equations (4.16)–(4.17).
• Rewritten the mathematical expression for erf(x) just after equation (4.28) for clar-
ity, and correcting (improving) the error term from O(x-1 ) to O(x-2 ).
• Explicitly including the error term in equations (4.29)–(4.31), and corrected (im-
proved) the error term in (4.32) to O().

Rebuttal to Reviewer 1

e point of contention is the correct rate law for the reaction
2H + (aq) + 2I - (aq) + H2 O2 (aq) <U+2192> I2 (aq) + 2H2 O(`), (1)
ich produces iodine from iodide.
r first submission applied the law of mass action directly to the reaction as a whole: the rate
roduction of iodine was assumed proportional to [I - ]2 , i.e. quadratic in iodide concentration.
en the asymptotic analysis is conducted, the resulting model for switchover time (p6) is
tsw <U+221D> m-20 ,
ich was found to fit the data well.
viewer 1’s initial report highlighted an issue we had missed: several papers have been pub-
ed which find that the rate of this reaction is proportional to [I - ], i.e. it is linear in iodide
centration. The underlying mechanism is that the reaction involves multiple steps, with the
e limiting step being a nucleophilic attack of [I - ] on H2 O2 , as described in the reference
pper & Koubek, J. Chem. Edu., 75(1):87-89, 1998] which the referee identified.
therefore re-derived the entire mathematical model and asymptotic analysis with the linear
recommended by Reviewer 1, in an open-minded attempt to understand this issue. After
we want to present the most accurate model of the system we are working with, and have
reason to prefer one model over another. Following the analysis through we found that with
ar kinetics, the model for switchover time would take the form
tsw <U+221D> m-10 .

then repeated the fitting procedure with this model (in fact fully expecting that Reviewer
suggestion would be correct). However, the new model could not fit the experimental data.
reover, on a log-log plot, the experimental data followed the relationship
tsw <U+221D> m0-2.3 ,
ch closer to the original model than the one following from a linear law.
ow we give the best model fits (fitting two parameters for two experimental series simulta-
usly), which again strongly support the inverse-square model over the inverse-linear:

e reason that the bottom left fit is so poor is that we are fitting both experimental se-
simultaneously: varying m0 and varying c0 , a more rigorous test than just fitting series
ependently).
ile we were very ready to accept Reviewer 1’s suggestion, supported by the references cited,
data were not consistent. On the other hand, the original quadratic model fits the data well.
r best explanation (given in our previous response to Reviewer 1) is that in our experiments
re is a great excess of hydrogen peroxide in our experiment (0.09 mol/l as compared with
01–0.006 mol/l vitamin C – as now included in section 5), whereas for example Copper and
ubek worked with concentrations of iodide and peroxide that were quite similar. This excess
hydrogen peroxide ensures that the rate-limiting step (nucleophilic attack of I - upon the
O2 in equation (4) of Copper and Koubek, 1998) responsible for the linear rate law is no
ger rate-limiting.

he experimental data had supported the model suggested by Reviewer 1 we would have very
lingly rewritten the paper around this, and indeed had carried out all the necessary new
culations. However, the data supported the original model.
ebuttal to Reviewer 1’s final response
eree 1’s final response did not engage with our detailed analysis of the consequences of
near reaction law nor our new analysis of the experimental data, but rather reiterated
ir original comment, adding that “if it is the case [that H2 O2 is in large excess], the H2 O2
centration does not change and can be included in the rate constant. This will turn the rate
in buffered media to rate = k0 [I - ]”.
e latter claim was not evidenced by Reviewer 1; indeed we would reason that there must
a point at which further increases in H2 O2 concentration simply saturate, so we do not
erstand the comment that the H2 O2 concentration “can be included in the rate constant”.
eems to us to be more probable that, because the overall reaction ultimately requires two I -
s to come together, once the rate-limiting step is no longer rate-limiting, the overall reaction
overned by the quadratic kinetics expected from the law of mass action. In any case, we
the issue is best decided by the fact that the data support the quadratic model, not the
ar one.
therefore appeal for the manuscript to be re-assessed on the basis that:
1. We assessed Reviewer 1’s suggested alternative model on an equal footing with the orig-
inal, and found that only the original model is consistent with the data.
2. Reviewer 1 did not respond to the fact that we had tested against experimental data, but
rather focused on repeating the references of the first report (which are not necessarily
relevant at high peroxide concentration), and making an un-evidenced suggestion that
the linear law would still apply at high peroxide concentration – despite the fact that the
data support the quadratic law.
ally, we emphasise that, apart from the above issue, all three reviewers made very construc-
and valuable comments, and regardless of what the outcome may be we thank them all for
roving our work.

Appendix D
The manuscript ‘Mathematical modelling of the vitamin C clock reaction’ by Kerr, Thomson, and
Smith, RSOS-181367.R1, now in a second version, is a very interesting study on the
mathematical modeling of chemical reactions, specially for clock reactions. The study is deep and
explore several aspects of the mathematical modeling of chemical reactions. The mathematical
concepts looks correct. However, my main concern was not solved in this second version of the
manuscript. As have indicated before, the chemical reaction
2H+ + 2I- + H2O2 ÿ I2 + 2H2O (1.1)
has a well established rate law*
rate = k[I-][H2O2] (in buffered media)
rate = k[I-][H2O2] + kN[I-][H2O2][H+] (considering the acid catalysis)
However, the authors consider the rate law indicated by eq (1.2)
rate = k0[I-]2
arguing that H2O2 is in large excess. If it is the case, the H2O2 concentration does not change and
can be included in the rate constant. This will turn the rate law in buffered media to
rate = k0[I-]
and not in the eq (1.2), which makes the mathematical work on this reaction unrealistic.
