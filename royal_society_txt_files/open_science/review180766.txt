The manuscript titled “Contributions of lunate cells and wax crystals to the surface anisotropy of
Nepenthes slippery zone” investigated the contributions of lunate cells and wax crystals to the
surface anisotropy of Nepenthes slippery zone. The results show that the anisotropic
configuration of lunate cells provide most of the anisotropy, whereas wax crystals produces less. I
commend this work is publishable after some problems was addressed.
1. The anisotropy provided by lunate cells was due to their anisotropic configuration. As to wax
crystals, when the load force was smaller than 1200 nN, the differential ratio of lee than 7.91% is
too weak to be evidence to declare the anisotropy. When the load force increased to 1500 nN, the
3
entire wax crystals were destroyed. The relatively large differential ratio is likely produced by the
substrate of slippery zone (page 13). According to the authors, the measured results could not
demonstrate the wax crystals produce the anisotropy of the slippery zone (it may result from the
substrate of the slippery zone).
2. Some anisotropic slippery surfaces bioinspired slippery Nepenthes surface have been reported
and the anisotropic properties have been investigated. Some related references should be cited,

This work analyzed the contributions of lunate cells and wax crystals to the surface anisotropy of
slippery zone by macro-micro-nano scaled experiments, and revealed the anisotropy mechanism
of Nepenthes slippery zone. I recommend this manuscript be published after the following
comments be carefully addressed:
1. Is it possible to give the friction data in nN (Figure 7), not in Volt? The calibration is needed to
compare the data.
2. In Figure 7, what is the meaning of FL(nN/µN)? Is this unit right?
3. I don’t understand the Left, Middle and Right panels in Figure 7(a)? Are they for the same
sample, but different loading range? Or for different samples? Please explain this in details.
4. Still in Figure 7, in the middle panel, the friction decreases as the loading force increases, not
following Amonton’s law. Why?
5. The authors mentioned “Accordingly, wax crystals make the cantilever tip generate different
4
friction data when scanning along the upward and downward directions”. But how, how does
the wax crystals influence friction forces?

Appendix A
Dear editors,
Thanks for your effort to this manuscript, also appreciate the reviewers for their
valuable and constructive comments. In the following, we try our best to reply these
comments in detail.
Reviewer 1-Comment 1: Wang et al. investigated the source of anisotropy in friction
between the walls of nepenthes pitcher plants and various proposed prey insects. Through
investigation of experiments and surface microstructure, they make clear the difference
between the anisotropy caused by wax crystals and the anisotropy caused by the lunate
cells beneath the wax. The English in this paper needs to be rechecked. The science in
this paper is, in my opinion, well done and fascinating.
Reply: Thanks for the suggestions, and we have checked the English in the
manuscript carefully, especially the grammar. The changed points are highlighted with
deep red color in our revised manuscript.
Reviewer 1-Comment 2: The information about insect friction should be added,
especially the schematics of experiments.
Reply: We try our best to catch the meanings of this comment. In our manuscript,
the Figure 1b (Experiment procedure), Figure 6 (results), and their linguistic description
are used to describe the insect (claws) friction on slippery zone. To make the description
much clearer, we added the information of insect friction, including the reason of taking
the ant Camponotus japonicus as experimental sample (the chapter of 2.3 Friction force
measurement, page 5), and the annotation of claws in Figure 6. In the revised manuscript,
we highlighted these changed points with rose color.
Reviewer 1-Comment 3: Figure captions should be polished.
Reply: All the Figure captions (page 21-22) in our manuscript are double checked to
revise the irrelevant and incorrect descriptions, as well as the grammar mistakes. The
changed points are highlighted with pink color in the revised manuscript.
Reviewer 2-Comment 1: The anisotropy provided by lunate cells was due to their
anisotropic configuration. As to wax crystals, when the load force was smaller than 1200
nN, the differential ratio of less than 7.91% is too weak to be evidence to declare the
anisotropy. When the load force increased to 1500 nN, the entire wax crystals were
destroyed. The relatively large differential ratio is likely produced by the substrate of
slippery zone (page 13). According to the authors, the measured results could not
demonstrate the wax crystals produce the anisotropy of the slippery zone (it may result
from the substrate of the slippery zone).
Reply: When the load force ranged from 1500 nN to 3000 nN, the differences in the
measured friction data were obvious (7.62–14.63%), but under these load forces the wax
crystals were destroyed completely and exposed the substrate of slippery zone. As
suggested by the reviewer (highlighted with red color in the above paragraph), most likely,
it is substrate not the wax crystals to make the cantilever tip generate the observably
different friction data. Therefore, the observable difference (7.62–14.63%) in the
measured friction data cannot be considered as strong evidence to declare the anisotropy
of wax crystals. Therefore, in the chapter of ‘4.2 Contribution of wax crystals to
anisotropy’, page 13-14, we revised the description. The changed parts was highlighted
with red color, as ‘Under these load forces, results of the SEM observation showed that the
cantilever tip could destroy the entire wax crystals, exposing the substrate of slippery zone (figure
8e–g). It is most likely that the substrate of slippery zone contacts with the cantilever tip and
causes the generation of the friction data. Accordingly, these significant differences in friction data
cannot serve as a reasonable evidence to declare the anisotropy of wax crystals, because they
probably result from the substrate of the slippery zone’.
Reviewer 2-Comment 2: Some anisotropic slippery surfaces bioinspired slippery
Nepenthes surface have been reported and the anisotropic properties have been
investigated. Some related references should be cited, such as (1) Adv. Mater. 2016, 28,
6999–7007; (2) Adv. Funct. Mater. 2018, 1801310 (DOI: 10.1002/adfm.201801310); (3)
Adv. Funct. Mater. 2017, 27, 1606199; (4) J. Mater. Chem. A 2018, 6, 3414–3421; (5)
ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2018, 10, 7442-7450.
Reply: Thanks for the valuable suggestion. We checked the five papers proposed by
the reviewer, and cited these papers in our manuscript, as [16], [17], [18], [19] and [20].
In the revised manuscript, the first paragraph of ‘Introduction’ part, we highlighted the
changed part with bright green color, as ‘and to develop super-lubricant interfaces for the
controllable motion of liquid droplets [16–20]’
Reviewer 3-Comment 1: Is it possible to give the friction data in nN (Figure 7), not in
Volt? The calibration is needed to compare the data.
Reply: Thanks for this valuable suggestion. The Figure 7 is used to show the
difference in friction data provided by the cantilever tip scanning on inverted-fixed and
normal-fixed slippery zones. Indeed, it is better to present the friction information with
the unit of ‘nN’. However, the friction data were scanned in three times (from July 2016
to March 2017), and the ‘spring’ of the AFM equipment was readjusted each time.
Unfortunately, the parameters of the AFM spring were not saved, so we could not present
the friction data with the unit of ‘nN’. Luckily, the differences in these friction data can
also be clearly showed with the unit of ‘V’. Appreciate for your understanding.
Reviewer 3-Comment 2: In Figure 7, what is the meaning of FL (nN/µN)? Is this unit
right?
Reply: In Figure 7a, the x-coordinates (Load force, FL) of the three panels have
different unit, the unit of the left panel is nN, the units of the middle and right panels are
µN, the FL (nN/µN) means the unit of nN and µN. However, it brings the various
interpretations, and we apologize for this mistake. In the revised manuscript, we corrected
this point (Figure 7a), as shown ‘Load force, FL (nN, left panel; µN, middle and right
panels)’ in Figure 7a.
Reviewer 3-Comment 3: I don’t understand the Left, Middle and Right panels in Figure
7(a)? Are they for the same sample, but different loading range? Or for different samples?
Please explain this in details.
Reply: The friction data of Figure 7a were obtained from the AFM scanning, namely,
the cantilever tip of the AFM apparatus scanned on the inverted-fixed and normal-foxed
slippery zones and generated the friction information. In all the AFM scanning, the
slippery zone from Nepenthes alata plant was selected as the experimental sample, the
load force and the scanning direction (downward or upward) were the variable factors.
Besides, the AFM scanning was conducted in three times from July 2016 to March 2017.
Therefore, the Left, Middle and Right panels in Figure 7a are the same samples (Slippery
zone from Nepenthes alata) with different load forces (from 100 to 3000 nN). To make
this point much clearer, we revised the corresponding points (the chapter of ‘2.4
AFM scanning’, page 6; caption of Figure 7, page 22), and highlighted with deep
yellow color in the revised manuscript.
Reviewer 3-Comment 4: Still in Figure 7, in the middle panel, the friction decreases as
the loading force increases, not following Amonton’s law. Why?
Reply: We studied the Amonton’s law: the force of friction is directly proportional
to the applied load, the force of friction is independent of the apparent area of contact,
kinetic friction is independent of the sliding velocity. As the increase of the applied load
force, sometimes the friction data decrease obviously (Figure 7a, middle panel), this is not
following the Amontons' 1st law. We guess, that is because, as the increase of the applied
load force, the cantilever tip can destroy the wax crystals and the fractured wax crystals
contaminate the cantilever tip, severing as a lubricant to cause the decrease of the friction
data. As being demonstrated in previous literatures (Gorb E, Hass K, Henrich A, Enders S,
Barbakadze N, Gorb S. 2005 Composite structure of the crystalline epicuticular wax layer of the slippery zone in the
pitchers of the carnivorous plant Nepenthes alata and its effect on insect attachment. J. Exp. Biol. 208, 4651–4662.
Wang LX, Zhou Q. 2011 Friction force of locust Locusta migratoria manilensis (Orthoptera, Locustidae) on slippery
zones surface of pitchers from four Nepenthes species. Tribol. Lett. 44, 345–353), the wax crystals can
contaminate insect attachment organs and decrease their attachment force. To make this
point much clearer, in the revised manuscript, we added the analysis (chapter of the
‘3.4 Friction test with an AFM cantilever’, page 10), and highlighted with orange
color.
Reviewer 3-Comment 5: The authors mentioned “Accordingly, wax crystals make the
cantilever tip generate different friction data when scanning along the upward and
downward directions”. But how, how does the wax crystals influence friction forces?
Reply: Based on the Figure 7, we concluded that: ‘Accordingly, wax crystals make
the cantilever tip generate different friction data when scanning along the upward and
downward directions, but the differences are not conspicuous, even rather unobvious.’.
The purpose of this analysis is to declare the differences in these friction data provided by
the cantilever tip on wax crystals along upward and downward directions were rather
small. We intended to show that the direction (upward or downward) of wax crystals
generates a slight effect to the friction data. To make our description act in accordance
with our real meaning, we revise this point (chapter of ‘3.4 Friction test with an AFM
cantilever’, page 10), as ‘Accordingly, when being scanned along the upward and
downward directions, the wax crystals make the cantilever tip generate different friction
data, but the differences are not conspicuous, even rather unobvious.’, and highlighted
with brown color.
The influence mechanism of wax crystals to the friction data is rather complicated,
and very difficult to conduct the corresponding experiments, because the structural
parameters of the wax crystals range from ~nm to ~µm, and the ~10µm structured lunate
cells with the space length of about 94µm and the height of 20 µm frequently interrupt the
AFM scanning. Next, we will pay attention to this influence mechanism, design a special
AFM cantilever to avoid the interrupt effect generated by the lunate cells, test the
mechanical properties of wax crystals, measure the friction forces under different loads
and different humidity, and propose a model to present a scientific explanation.
The above are our reply to the comments. However, we are not sure that the reviewers
can completely accept our reply. If not, we will revise this manuscript again. Thank you
for your effort.
Sincerely yours,
Lixin Wang, Yu Tian
