Environmental-friendly wood fibre composite with high bonding strength and water resistance.
In this paper, a green wood fibre composite with specific bonding strength and water resistance
was reported. This work is improtant and interesting. But there are still some special comments
that should concern us.
1) The language of the whole manuscript should be improved.
2) The explain for the change in the relative crystallinity of samples should been supported by
some references.
3) The bonding mechanism of these wood fibre composites should be further clarified in the text.
How about the work of adhesives ? I donot think it is enough in the prestent form.

In the paper "Environmental-friendly wood fibre composite with high bonding strength and
water resistance", Xiaodi and co-workers investigated the effect of chitosan on the bonding
performance and water resistance of wood fiber composites in detail. The overall structure and
analysis in the manuscript are very much comprehensive and accurate. It is very interesting and I
recommend its publication in Royal Open Science after some reversion.

Environmental-friendly wood fibre composite with high bonding strength and water
resistance.
In this paper, a green wood fibre composite with specific bonding strength and water
resistance was reported. This work is important and interesting. But there are still
some special comments that should concern us.
1. The language of the whole manuscript should be improved.
Response to comment 1:
Thanks for your precious comments and suggestions. We do apologize for the poor
writing. However, the original manuscript was carefully edited by a native English-
speaking editor of a professional English editing company, and punctuation was
verified and corrected where needed. According to your suggestions, we checked our
manuscript carefully and corrected the writing errors again.
2. The explain for the change in the relative crystallinity of samples should been
supported by some references.
Response to comment 2:
Thanks for your precious comments. We feel sorry for the inadequate references.
According to your suggestion, we revised the explanation for the change in the
relative crystallinity of samples and added some references.
3. The bonding mechanism of these wood fibre composites should be further clarified
in the text. How about the work of adhesives? I do not think it is enough in the present
form.
Response to comment 3:
Great thanks to the critical review of our paper. Hearing your strict comment has
suddenly awoken us to realize that bonding mechanism of these wood fibre
composites has not been explained fully only through the FTIR analysis, XPS analysis,
XRD analysis and SEM image analysis in our manuscript. We are extremely sorry for
our inadequate elucidation of the bonding mechanism. Generally, traditional theories
of adhesion include mechanical interlocking, adsorption interactions, electrostatic
forces, diffusion mechanisms and chemical bonding theory and bonding process is
very complicated. The bonding quality of the wood fibre composites is influenced by
many factors including adherend, adhesive, bonding technology, environmental media,
etc. We agree with what you said and do admit that the not all the work of this
adhesive and bonding mechanism were fully elucidated. In fact, it is almost
impossible to precisely delineate the whole bonding mechanism. The purpose of
elucidation of the bonding mechanism is to guide practice. Although the bonding
mechanism given in the original manuscript is only a part of the whole bonding
mechanism, it is still of guiding significance and lays foundation for fabrication of the
wood fibre composite. It should be stressed here that the results presented in this
paper are a part of a larger research study that intends to fabricate an environmental-
friendly wood fibre composite using a chitosan-based formaldehyde-free adhesive
which was prepared by ourselves. In this present paper we focused on the fabrication,
performance and potential bonding mechanism of the environmental-friendly wood
fibre composite instead of the chitosan-based adhesive. We clearly clarified the
fabrication and performance of this wood fibre composite. In combination of the
results of FTIR spectroscopy, XPS analysis, XRD patterns, SEM images, and the
previous works of ours and other researchers, the partial potential bonding mechanism
of these wood fibre composites and the partial effect of the adhesive on wood fibre
composite was conjectured roughly and revealed in the original manuscript.
Meanwhile, we prepared another paper focused on the preparation and
characterizations of the chitosan-based adhesive [1]. The detailed information about
the adhesive was given in that paper. Nevertheless, we are extremely sorry that the we
have not provide the adequate information about the whole mechanism of the wood
fibre composite in this paper. We have corrected the related description about the
bonding mechanism in the revised manuscript. We will continue the research of
bonding mechanism of the wood fibre composite in future.

resistance. Carbohyd. Polym. 176, 273-280. (doi:10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.08.100)
4. Why does author choose the chitosan as the adhesives? How about the other
thermoset polymers?
Response to comment 4:
Thanks for your precious comment. Traditional thermosetting polymers which could
be used as adhesives include epoxy resin adhesives, phenol-formaldehyde resin
adhesives, amino resin adhesives, polyurethane adhesives, etc. Some of these
thermosetting polymers, like phenol-formaldehyde resin adhesives and amino resin
adhesives, are harmful to human due to the formaldehyde emission. The others are
more environmental-friendly, but they are almost expensive. Moreover, the raw
materials for these thermosetting adhesives are from petroleum resources, which are
depleting gradually and non-renewable. As stated above, the results presented in this
paper are a part of a larger research study that intends to fabricate an environmental-
friendly wood fibre composite using a chitosan-based formaldehyde-free adhesive
which was prepared by ourselves. Chitosan is a derivative from the natural amino
polysaccharide chitin, one of the most abundant natural polysaccharides, next to only
cellulose. Chitin is a main component of crab and shrimp shells. Efficient utilization
of chitin could solve the problem of waste and pollution due to crab and shrimp shells
and could further be beneficial to sustainable development. The acetic acid solution of
chitosan is viscous and homogenous liquid. Similar to common amino resin adhesives,
there are numerous free amino groups on the molecular chains of chitosan, which
endows chitosan with bonding capacity. Compared to other natural adhesives,
chitosan exhibits excellent water resistance and antibacterial property. Besides, based
on our latest research which used a blend of chitosan and other inexpensive natural
environmental-friendly material as adhesive, the cost of wood fibre composite using a
chitosan-based adhesive was 1.1 ~ 1.7 times wood fibre composite made with urea-
formaldehyde reins adhesive, which is much lower than wood fibre composite made
with epoxy resin adhesives and polyurethane adhesives. We believe that we will
reduce the cost further. Therefore, renewable chitosan shows great potential as a
multifunctional environmental-friendly wood fibre composite adhesive with low cost.
That is why we chose chitosan as adhesives.
5. The latest references should be cited in the text.
Response to comment 5:
Thanks for your precious comments and suggestions. We are sorry for the references
which are not latest in the original manuscript. According to your suggestions, we
replaced some of them in the revised manuscript.
Thanks again for your valuable comments, which are helpful for improving our paper.
The revised parts which we modified according to your suggestions are marked in red

Response to General Comments:
Thanks for your precious comments and suggestions, which give us much help to
improve the quality of our manuscript. According to your suggestion, we added some
sub-headings in the revised manuscript.
Specific Comments
a) The authors should revise and change the impression of the sentence in Line 42
Page 1,” Therefore, formaldehyde emission from traditional wood fiber composite
hinder its applications in upscale applications.”
Response to comment a:
Thanks for your precious comments and suggestions. We are sorry for such an
inappropriate impression. According to your suggestion, we corrected this impression
in the revised manuscript.
b) Page 3, Line 44-45: The authors mentioned that the water resistance of wood
composites for WFC4 and WFC5 declined without discussing the mechanism that
why was it so?
Response to comment b:
Thanks for your precious comments. The reason for the decline of water resistance is
the same with that for the decrease in bonding strength, which we provided in the
original manuscript. In view of this, we did not explain why water resistance in the
original manuscript. However, hearing your comment has made us realize that the
absence of this reason was inappropriate. Therefore, we added this reason in the
revised manuscript.
c) Page 4, Line 27: The number of Table should be changed from 1 to 2 in XPS
analysis.
Response to comment c:
Thanks for your suggestion. We are sorry for such a silly mistake. According to your
suggestion, we corrected this error in the revised manuscript.
d) Page 4, Line 48-49: The impression of the sentence in Lines 48-49 should be
revised and changed.
Response to comment d:
Thanks for your precious comment and suggestion. We agree with your precious
comment and changed this impression in the revised manuscript.
e) The authors should mention the purpose of calculating the crystallinity of wood
fibers.
Response to comment e:
Thanks for your precious comments and suggestions. Crystallinity of cellulose means
the percentage of crystalline region in cellulose to the whole cellulose and is an
important parameter that describes the supermolecular structure of cellulose.
Crystallinity is a major factor that influences the mechanical and dimensional
properties of wood-based materials. The influence of hot-pressing, other components
of wood fibres and adhesives on the crystallization behavior of cellulose could be
roughly speculated through calculating the crystallinity. Combining with calculating
the crystallinity and other analytical methods, the changes of adhesives and wood
fibres and the interactions between adhesives and wood fibres could be roughly
determined and thus some of the bonding mechanisms could be roughly conjectured.
Therefore, the crystallinity of wood fibres was calculated in the manuscript.
According to your comment, the purpose of calculating the crystallinity of wood
fibres was added and XRD analysis was amended in the revised manuscript.
f) The authors should study the thermal studies of the wood composite, it would be
quite interesting to evaluate the effect of heating the wood composites.
Response to comment f:
Thanks for your precious comments and suggestions. We are sorry that we did not
study the thermal study in the original manuscript. The thermal property of wood fibre
composites without any adhesives already had been studied thoroughly [1-3], while
the thermal property of the chitosan-based adhesive used in this manuscript was also
studied in depth by ourselves in another paper [4], in which the adhesive did not show
any changes except water loss below 200 °C. Besides, it is near impossible to expose
this wood fibre composite to high temperature in practice use. Moreover, potential
interactions between wood fibres and adhesives and bonding mechanisms were
detailed analyzed through the combination of FTIR spectroscopy, XPS analysis, XRD
patterns, SEM images, and the previous works of ours and other researchers. Hence,
we did not study the thermal property of the wood fibre composite. Notwithstanding,
we think that your comment is vey valuable and believe that the interactions between
wood fibres and adhesives and bonding mechanisms could be further revealed
through thermal property analysis. We will further study the thermal property of the
wood fibre composite in near future.
