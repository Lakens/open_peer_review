The authors developed a method to prepare superhydrophobic coatings, which also shows
repellence to oil and blood. I suggest this paper should be published after minor revision.
The authors should provide more information in Introduction to compare this work with
literature regarding the creation of micro/nano morphologies using TiO2 and ZnO for
superhydrophobic coatings. For example, Lu et al., Robust self-cleaning surfaces that function
when exposed to either air or oil, Science 347 (6226), 1132-1135; Campbell et al., Electrowetting of

This work reported the fabrication of micro-nanoscale hierarchical nanowire network as self-
cleaning coating based on 1D TiO2 nanowires. The hierarchical nanowire network displaced
homogenous micro/nano-topography, and exhibited high repellency to water and cell culture
medium. This work provided a promising way of using nanowires as template to make micro-
nano-scale hierarchical coating. I recommend publication with minor revision on Royal Society
Open Science if the follow comments were able to address.
1) Tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl trichlorosilane has been widely used as fluorinated
coating reagent (e.g. Nature Biotechnology, 2014, 32, 1134–1140), and it has better reactivity than
the perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane for functionalizing on oxide materials. Many works have used
tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl trichlorosilane even to achieve omniphobic effects. Why the
authors used did not use tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl trichlorosilane but instead using
the lower reactivity one.
2) The TiO2 nanowires were deposited on the substrate but not physically or chemically attached
to the substrate. Is it robust? Does it come off from the substrate during the ZnO nanowires
growth process.
3
3) Why using TiO2 nanowires as coating has advantages compared to directly making micro-
nano-toporgraphy/roughess on substrate? Making coating tends to be less mechanically robust.

mments to the Author
authors developed a method to prepare superhydrophobic coatings, which also shows
ellence to oil and blood. I suggest this paper should be published after minor revision.
authors should provide more information in Introduction to compare this work with literature
arding the creation of micro/nano morphologies using TiO2 and ZnO for superhydrophobic
tings. For example, Lu et al., Robust self-cleaning surfaces that function when exposed to either
or oil, Science 347 (6226), 1132-1135; Campbell et al., Electrowetting of Superhydrophobic
O Nanorods, Langmuir, 2008, 24 (9), pp 5091–5098 etc.
Authors’ response:
We are grateful for the reviewer’s comment. We have now added a discussion on some
selected work about superhydrophobic TiO2 and ZnO coatings including the suggested
literature in the Introduction section as follows:
“Recently, much research has been focused on investigating the wetting behaviors of metal
oxide semiconductors such as TiO2 and ZnO for desirable functional properties.[1-6] For
instance, Lu et al. created an ethanolic suspension of perfluorosilane-coated dual-scale TiO2
nanoparticles as an excellent water repellent paint.[1] Campbell et al. studied the
electrowetting properties of ZnO nanorods with sputtered Teflon. Reversible wettabilities
were observed under a threshold voltage of 35 V.[2] Sun et al. synthesized ZnO hollow
microspheres with robust superhydrophobicity.[3] Although there has been significant
progress in fabricating hydrophobic coatings, the possibility of using nanowires as building
blocks for superhydrophobic hierarchical structure assembling is worth to be explored. In this
work…”

s work reported the fabrication of micro-nanoscale hierarchical nanowire network as self-
aning coating based on 1D TiO2 nanowires. The hierarchical nanowire network displaced
mogeneous micro/nano-topography, and exhibited high repellency to water and cell culture
dium. This work provided a promising way of using nanowires as template to make micro-
o-scale hierarchical coating. I recommend publication with minor revision on Royal Society
en Science if the follow comments were able to address.
Tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl trichlorosilane has been widely used as fluorinated
coating reagent (e.g. Nature Biotechnology, 2014, 32, 1134–1140), and it has better reactivity
than the perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane for functionalizing on oxide materials. Many works
have used tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl trichlorosilane even to achieve omniphobic
effects. Why the authors used did not use tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl trichlorosilane
but instead using the lower reactivity one.
Authors’ response:
We agree with the referee that tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl trichlorosilane as
fluorinated coating reagent is very reactive and commonly used. However the presence
of tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl trichlorosilane will hydrolyze during the
functionalization and the HCl produced may generate undesired damage to the ZnO
nanowire structure. In this study we use perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane to minimize the
unexpected influence on the structure and thus the surface modification can be achieved
either by vapor-phase or solution-phase deposition. Perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane as the
fluorinated reagent has also been frequently reported for surface modification of TiO2 [1,
7]
and ZnO [3] structures. We have now cited these references in the text as follows:
“To achieve desirable water-repelling property, samples were further modified to be
superhydrophobic by conjugating fluorinated silane (perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane[1, 3, 7])
on the surface to form a chemically bonded low surface energy layer.”
The TiO2 nanowires were deposited on the substrate but not physically or chemically attached
to the substrate. Is it robust? Does it come off from the substrate during the ZnO nanowires
growth process?
Authors’ response: We thank the reviewer for the comment. After deposition, the TiO2
nanowires were further immobilized by sputtering a 20-nm ZnO layer. The structure was
robust and the TiO2 nanowires did not come off from the substrate.
Why using TiO2 nanowires as coating has advantages compared to directly making micro-
nano-topography/roughness on substrate? Making coating tends to be less mechanically robust.
Authors’ response: We thank the reviewer for the comment. We agree with the referee
that in some cases micro-nano-topography/roughness structure could be directly
fabricated on substrate. However, such approach relies heavily on the intrinsic properties
of the chosen substrate. If the substrate material is unable to be fabricated with sub-micro
features or susceptible to the fabrication process, this approach become unsuitable to be
applied. Instead, using nanowires as coating may get rid of the restriction of substrate
types. Since the micro-nanoscale objects were physically absorbed or coated on the
substrate, it allows a variety of substrates to be functionalized with superhydrophobicity
regardless of the intrinsic material of substrate.
