In my eyes this paper provides nice evidence from real life data for the influences of comparisons
on judgments – even if judges are highly trained experts who would want to avoid such
influences. The paper is well written and well embedded in previous research. Overall, the
statistics are sound and the interpretation straight forward and appropriate. Given that the
results are not in line with findings based on judgments in other sport events, these results have
the potential to further encourage research and discussion. Obviously one limitation is that one
can only speculate what is causing the diversion from previous studies. However, it clearly
indicates that judgment biases based on comparisons have real life consequences and that at the
same time we still don’t fully understand what biases are expected under which circumstances.
I only have some minor suggestions for changes. First, I would encourage the author to always
rely on a random effect model for combing correlations. I believe theoretical this would make
sense even if empirically there is no (statistically significant) evidence for heterogeneity. I would
for example expect that the influence of the comparison effect might depend on the type of
judgement. Some judges judged a single athlete whereas other judged the synchronization
between two athletes. To expect that the effect of sequential comparison is truly equal for both
kind of judgments seems to be odd. I also think that random effect model would better fit to the
nested structure of the data set for the analysis of the sequential effect (several correlations are
nested within one judge). Second I would encourage the author to describe more clearly the
analysis of the sequential effects. I would describe it more in line with the description of the
overall and the serial position effect. Specifically, I would like to know on how many pairs of
values a single correlation is based (I believe this would be seven for the within-round score and
four or five for the between-round score, whereby the latter is already mentioned on page 12) and
how many correlations are combined in the meta-analysis. Actually, right now I am not entirely
sure whether I understood the analysis correctly, because the author writes on page 12 “… there
are far fewer between –rounds scores to analyze for each judge” even though I believe it is four or
five compared to seven.

Comments to the Author(s)

In this paper entitled " Sequential effects in Olympic synchronised diving scores", Kramer tested
for sequential effects in a specific ‘real-life’ setting. In contrast to his prediction, the author
demonstrates a contrastive effect and claims this might reflect something specific about the role
of judges in synchronized diving.
In general, this is a solid study that is easy to follow. From a larger perspective, I think these
results are interesting, raising a potentially important question about the way Olympic divers are
judged. At this stage, I would need the author to revise their intro/discussion to explore a wider
(and relevant) literature before I could recommend publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Introduction
The author is talking about sequential effects but fails to cite important recent findings that would
help support his argument (And make solid predictions about sequential effects based on the
timing of judgements).
I would recommend including these.

strategies for the perception of stable and changeable facial attributes. (2016) Nature: Scientific
Reports
The last seems particularly relevant as it finds contrastive and assimilative effects can act on the
same visual signal raising timing as a relevant factor in sequential judgements.
In truth, other papers have pointed to timing factors as being crucial in determining whether a
sequential effect is assimilative or contrast and yet this is not mentioned at all in this introduction
(see Taubert & Alais, Vis Cog, 2016 and Pegors et al., 2016) – perhaps this should be included as a
discussion point. Could it not be true that faster decisions are more likely to be assimilative (or
when diving displays are shorter in length)?
Discussion
The author calls for more research into other sports but I’m interested to know how specific these
effects might be (in the authors opinion). For instance, could it be that at the Olympic level (with
television rights and so forth) that decisions need to be made in a different time frame than in
other competitions for the same event? If timing is an important factor (which, as I mentioned
before, seems to be for purely perceptual judgements in the lab see references above) could this
not be an alternate explanation for these findings?
