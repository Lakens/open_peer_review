Comments to the Author(s)
It is an interesting paper about a very complex industrial subject. After introducing the flow, heat
transfer, and solidification model the problem is formulated in nondimensional form, and 12 non-
dimensional parameters are identified. Estimating the numerical values of the parameters four of
them turn out to be very small or very and thus, eight parameters remain in the reduced model.
I have only one major objection against publication in the present form. It is not clear how z_0,
the location of the tip of the strand shell is determined. Obviously, it is not determined by
thermal considerations.
I think, in the present model z_0 is determined by the continuity of the flow rate Q_R of the flux
and the flux layer thickness h at z0.
Since the boundary conditions for the vertical flow speed u_z change at $z_0$ from no shear
stress (3.31) in the upper zone to no slip condition in the lower zone. If the location z_0 of the tip
is at an arbitrary location, there would be a discontinuity in the pressure gradient and hence in
the flux layer thickness h. In the present model, z_0 is determined such that the pressure gradient
and thus h is continuous. I think this is unphysical; z_0 has to be determined by thermal
conditions.
Thus, I urge the authors to work out clearly, how z_0 is determined.

2. Page 4, line 43: Arguing that shrinkage effects have a negligible effect is misleading. Note taper

3. Eq 3.5 uses a lubrication approximation that neglects oscillation and inertial effects such as the

4. Page 4, line 33: Prescribed heat flux is not described.
5. Page 4, line 36: It is evident that the location of the molten/solid steel interface affects the

simplicity”. This is not physically meaningful.
8. Eqs. 3.13-3.16 are not physically meaningful since solid slag does not move at the same speed
as liquid slag. Making 3.16 =0 would make powder consumption 0. Text implies that all right

10. Table of properties: Ks(s) seems too high for steel (reference required), slag viscosity of 0.5 Pa-

11. Rms = Rmf = 2x10-4seems to make a huge difference in heat flux by several orders of
magnitude with small increases in R. Biot number as defined in the paper requires R as one of the
main values (after Eq 4.8) and the effect of R propagates to the whole model. Biot assumption is
not correct since Biot number exceeds 100 in the best case which makes the assumption of
Newton cooling invalid.

13. Figures 6 -8. Agreement of model with oscillation marks measured experimentally is just
logical since boundary conditions provided produce perturbations to create the required OSM

Comments to the Author(s)
Overall
The language is good but I find it difficult to follow the story line since it feels jumpy. Especially
chapters 3-6 (including a-c) needs more explaining text in the beginning of each chapter as glue to
previous chapter. Perhaps the text about the layout in the introduction chapter (p.2 line 58 – p3
line 50) can be moved to each chapter?
1. Introduction
What is the purpose of the article? For example, is the purpose of the article to model oscillation-
mark formation by introducing dimensionless parameters? Or is it to improve the older model
introduced by Hill et al. (1999)? Or is it to introduce a theoretical model that is not so time
consuming to use? Or something else? To have a clear purpose also helps the reader to follow
and understand what you are trying to achieve with the article.
The introduction includes both results and analyses (p.2 line 51-57). Please separate them from
the introduction. Perhaps a pre-study could be included.
The layout (p.2 line 58 – p3 line 50) is not needed. Instead I think each chapter should be
explained in more detail. Which would make it easier for the reader to follow and understand all
the choices through the article.
I think the schematic diagram in Figure 1 (p. 2) is to detailed. A suggestion is that you illustrate
the key features about how oscillations marks occurs. Since two different kinds of oscillations
marks (overflow-type and fold-type marks) are mentioned in the article (p.4 line 17-20 and p. 21
line 52-55), show and explain the difference between them.
2. Experiment
How many samples were cut out? As I understand you have just done one experiment, where
two oscillation marks were cut out. A recommendation is to test different settings for the twelve
parameters to validate the model with reality? Perhaps Design of Experiments could be used to
investigate possible interaction effects (correlations) between the parameters.
In which “Section b)” (p.4 line 22) is the results presented?
7. Results
The presented results are based on original data from Hild et al. (1999) and Saleem and
Fredriksson (2016). Here I also would like to see the comparison between the models (Hild et al.,
1999 and Saleem and Fredriksson, 2016) in more detail, for example, with figures or tables. So the
reader can make their own opinion about the results.
In this chapter I would like to have a summary of your twelve dimensionless parameters.
Perhaps like Table 1 (p. 8)?
8. Conclusions
In this chapter you are saying that your method is valid for both sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal
mould oscillations (p. 21 line 31-32). But on the other hand you are saying that the obtained
results should also be valid for non-sinusoidal mould oscillations (p. 17 line 59-60). Is it or should
it? What is correct?
I am missing a discussion about how easy/difficult it is to use the model in reality. For example,
5
how easy/difficult is it to collect and measure the final twelve parameters? Do you need any
basic knowledge to use the model? If yes, what?

Since the boundary conditions for the vertical flow speed u_z change at $z_0$ from no shear

is at an arbitrary location, there would be a discontinuity in the pressure gradient and hence in

the flux layer thickness h. In the present model, z_0 is determined such that the pressure gradient
and thus h is continuous. I think this is unphysical; z_0 has to be determined by thermal
conditions.
Thus, I urge the authors to work out clearly, how z_0 is determined.

Decision letter 2 (RSOS-160208)
05 January 2017
Dear Michael,
Belated happy New Year to you – I hope you had a pleasant break over the holiday period.
Over the Christmas break, I had a reply from the Editor consulted regarding the appeal, and they
consider that your comments are sufficient to overturn the rejection decision and invite a
resubmission of your paper and, in so doing, to take into account the referees’ comments as best
you can.
When you are ready to resubmit your manuscript, please do so as a new submission
(unfortunately, we’re unable to ‘reopen’ originally rejected manuscript for a number of technical
reasons), and include reference to the original manuscript in your covering letter – i.e. include a
sentence to highlight that it is a resubmission following appeal of RSOS-160208 – this will help us
to effectively track the manuscript and ensure that it is treated as a resubmission.
I hope this is okay, and I’m sorry that it has taken longer than ideal to get this outcome to you.
Best regards,
Andrew

I withdraw my critics of my first review concerning the determination of the tip of the solidified
strand shell. Mathematically, the model is correct. However, it needs very careful reading to find
out, where $z_0(t)$ is eliminated by an asymptotic argument $Z_L\gg1$ after equation (6.37).
I urge the authors to add a remark in the first paragraph of section 3, where $z_0(t)$ is
introduced, that knowledge of $z_0(t)$ is irrelevant for the oscillation mark formation mechanism
according to
present model. It will be eliminated by an asymptotic argument following eq. (6.37).

Overall assessment
The paper describes a mathematical model to calculate the depth of fold-type oscillation marks.
My overall opinion is that the paper is worthy of publication. It seems to me that the simplicity of
the model is both its strength and its weakness. It provides values for the depth of the oscillation
marks using a relatively simple development of a model proposed by Hill et al. The conditions in
the mould are complex and are ever-changing and so a simple model excludes all these
fluctuations and interactions and I suspect, for this reason, engineers will look to more complex
models of the fluid flow, heat transfer and solidification to determine the oscillation mark depths.
How would the present model be used ?
I am not a mathematical modeller so I have looked at paper from the view of how could I use it. I
have checked the equations cited in the paper and they seem sound but I note Referee 2 made a
thorough analysis of the equations and assumptions made in the paper.
The equations used seem OK to me but I am a bit uneasy of some of the assumptions made.
Cracks are associated with deep oscillation marks –so conditions must be adjusted to maintain
shallow oscillation marks (OMs). The model would be useful to calculate the mean values for the
depth of the oscillation marks. However, the model refers to fold- type marks and not to overflow
marks. How do you know whether your marks are fold or overflow without carrying out tests
first ? Fold- type OMs pertain to thick shells so to high heat fluxes in the meniscus region. The
usual steps to minimise OM depth are:
1. To form a short, thin shell by improving the thermal insulation of the shell and also
reducing the horizontal heat transfer (which might result in switch to overflow –type mark).
2. Increase superheat which cause the shell to be formed further down the mould
3. Reduce Ar flow (to reduce gaseous convection in the bed) and therefore decrease vertical
heat transfer.
Given these facts, I am queasy about the assumptions regarding
1. The bed thickness is maintained constant (since the bed is a major player).
2. Assuming the superheat is close to zero (since it is kept high when reducing OM depths).
I would be interested to hear the author’s comments.
Other aspects of the paper
The paper is well-written, the English is fine, figures are clear and necessary, the abstract and
conclusions are appropriate.

have checked the equations cited in the paper and they seem sound but I note Referee 2 made a
thorough analysis of the equations and assumptions made in the paper.
The equations used seem OK to me but I am a bit uneasy of some of the assumptions made.
Cracks are associated with deep oscillation marks –so conditions must be adjusted to maintain
shallow oscillation marks (OMs). The model would be useful to calculate the mean values for the
depth of the oscillation marks. However, the model refers to fold- type marks and not to overflow
marks. How do you know whether your marks are fold or overflow without carrying out tests
first ? Fold- type OMs pertain to thick shells so to high heat fluxes in the meniscus region. The
usual steps to minimise OM depth are:
1. To form a short, thin shell by improving the thermal insulation of the shell and also
reducing the horizontal heat transfer (which might result in switch to overflow –type mark).
2. Increase superheat which cause the shell to be formed further down the mould
3. Reduce Ar flow (to reduce gaseous convection in the bed) and therefore decrease vertical
heat transfer.
Given these facts, I am queasy about the assumptions regarding
1. The bed thickness is maintained constant (since the bed is a major player).
2. Assuming the superheat is close to zero (since it is kept high when reducing OM depths).
I would be interested to hear the author’s comments.
Other aspects of the paper
The paper is well-written, the English is fine, figures are clear and necessary, the abstract and
conclusions are appropriate.

ear Andrew,
hank you for your correspondence regarding our manuscript. However, we feel your decision to
rminate at this point is perhaps a little premature.
eferees 1 and 3 are not rejecting the paper, but are asking for extra clarification which we can
rovide:
) Referee 1 indicated that this was an "interesting paper", and objected to publication in the
resent form, rather than objecting to the paper outright.
) Referee 3 felt that the style of the paper was jumpy, but has provided very useful pointers on how
improve it.
eferee 2 was, of course, much more critical and provided a lengthy catalogue of objections. In spite
f these objections, which are mainly to do with model assumptions, it should nevertheless be noted
om Fig. 8 that the model gives very good agreement with experimental measurements; indeed, to
e best of our knowledge, this is the first time such good agreement between experimentally
easured and modelled oscillation mark depth has been obtained. This indicates that our
ssumptions were reasonable, rather than being completely wrong.
oreover, we believe some of this referee's comments, e.g.
13. Figures 6 -8. Agreement of model with oscillation marks measured experimentally is just logical
nce boundary conditions provided produce perturbations to create the required OSM profile."
be misinformed: we did not prescribe the boundary conditions so as to produce perturbations to
eate the required OSM profile - we believe that the referee has misunderstood this point.
urthermore, in any possible future resubmission, we will be able to refer to two further pieces of
cent work,

hich give arguably the most extensive experimental cataloguing and categorisation of oscillation
arks ever undertaken in any one study (Reviewer 3, item 2), and lend further support to the work

REPLY TO REFEREE #1
>>I have only one major objection against publication in the present form.
It is not clear how z 0, the location of the tip of the strand shell is determined.
Obviously, it is not determined by thermal considerations.
I think, in the present model z 0 is determined by the continuity of the flow
rate Q R of the flux and the flux layer thickness h at z0.
Since the boundary conditions for the vertical flow speed u z change at $z 0$
from no shear stress (3.31) in the upper zone to no slip condition in the lower
zone. If the location z 0 of the tip is at an arbitrary location, there would be a
discontinuity in the pressure gradient and hence in the flux layer thickness h.
In the present model, z 0 is determined such that the pressure gradient and thus
h is continuous. I think this is unphysical; z 0 has to be determined by thermal
conditions.
Thus, I urge the authors to work out clearly, how z 0 is determined.
In fact, we had already hinted in the first version that z0 has to be determined
by thermal conditions at the bottom of page 7. However, it has turned out
asymptotically that we do not need to determine it as regards the leading-order
problem, essentially because ZL » Z0 (t ) , as explained on page 15. We may
also note that Hill et al. do not give any indication of the value of z0 . Moreover,
the fact that we obtain good agreement via Figure 9 indicates to us that we
have resolved this issue adequately enough here.
This is not to say, however, that this is the end of the story. In fact, we are
currently working on an extension of the present analysis where we take into
account the full details of the meniscus region, i.e. the possibility of a solidifying
meniscus; in that case, we would expect that z0 will not be eliminated in this
way.

REPLY TO REFEREE #2
In order to make it easier to locate the changes made in response to this
reviewer, we have highlighted them in yellow.
>> 1. Page 4, line 36: Assumption on flat meniscus is not physically mean-
ingful.
To avoid misunderstanding or misinterpretation, we have removed the words
“which is here assumed to be flat”. No assumption on the shape of the meniscus
is necessary in this model.
>> 2. Page 4, line 43: Arguing that shrinkage effects have a negligible effect
is misleading. Note taper effects in real casters.
Whilst it is true that real casters have taper in order to counteract shrinkage,
our line of reasoning was that Hill et al. included shrinkage in their model, yet
obtained an oscillation mark profile (in their Fig. 5) that looked no different
from what they would have obtained had they not included shrinkage; had
shrinkage had a demonstrable effect, one might have expected the computed
oscillation mark profile in their Fig. 5 to look more like their schematic Fig. 3.
We have rewritten the final sentence in the paragraph before the start of section
3(a) as:
“Note also that the solidified steel shell can also be subject to thermal con-
traction, although we neglect this effect here, as it seemed to make little con-
tribution to the results for the computed oscillation mark profile in [7]; had the
contribution been more significant, the profile in question, in their Fig. 5, would
have more closely resembled the schematic in their Fig. 3 (and our Fig. 5). ”
>> 3. Eq 3.5 uses a lubrication approximation that neglects oscillation and
inertial effects such as the slag pumping by the rim which is widely acknowledged
in practice.
Does the referee really mean eq. 3.5 here? The inertial effects would be
present in the momentum equation in eq. 3.4, rather than in eq 3.5 which, in
any case, contains the convection terms.
If it is indeed eq. 3.4 that the referee meant, then we draw attention to the
discussion between equations (4.5) and (4.6), which indicates that the relevant
Reynolds number would be much smaller than unity, thereby justifying the ne-
glect of the inertial effects. Moreover, just because a lubrication approximation
is used does not mean that oscillation is neglected - oscillation is present via
boundary condition (3.13). We note also that slag pumping is present in the
model, as previously discussed by Hill et al. and references therein.
>> 4. Page 4, line 33: Prescribed heat flux is not described.
We have not prescribed the heat flux. Rather, we have described in the
second line of section 3 how heat is removed, i.e. via the flowing water, and this
is eventually incorporated into equation (3.8). This is equivalent to what was
done by Hill et al. 1999, although expressed differently. As regards the heat
coming into flux/steel problem, this is given via equations (3.21) and (3.22).
2
>> 5. Page 4, line 36: It is evident that the location of the molten/solid
steel interface affects the location of oscillation marks at the triple point. Thus,
assumption is misleading.
It is not clear to us what the referee thinks that we are assuming here - z0 (t) ,
s0 (t) and h0 (t)? If so, then we emphasize that we are not prescribing these; these
are unknowns which we determine as part of the solution to the problem. Or
was the referee meaning to say “molten flux/molten steel interface”, as stands
in line 37?
>> 6. Eq. 3.8 introduces the Interfacial Contact Resistance of 2x10-4. Why
was this value chosen?
As indicated in Table 1, this is the value given in Hill et al, although it
also turns out to be the value used by Ramirez-Lopez et al. (2012) and J.-F.
Holzhauser, K. Spitzer and K. Schwerdtfeger, Steel Res., 1999, vol. 70 (10), pp.
430–36.
>> 7. Page 6, line 12: The paragraph acknowledges that interfacial resis-
tance should actually change between lubricated area, dry and air-gap, but the
value is considered equal “for the sake of simplicity”. This is not physically
meaningful.
We could have kept more than one interfacial resistance in the model, but in
the absence of accurate data for these, the fact that there are already so many
model parameters and the fact that we obtain such good agreement between
theory and experiment in Fig. 10, we believe that the simplicity is justified.
>> 8. Eqs. 3.13-3.16 are not physically meaningful since solid slag does
not move at the same speed as liquid slag. Making 3.16 =0 would make powder
consumption 0. Text implies that all right terms in 3.16,3.20 and 3.23 are set
to zero.
Eqs. 3.13 is merely the classical no-slip boundary condition of fluid mechan-
ics. One could argue that slip occurs between the solid slag and the liquid slag
at y = s, but there seems little point adding further complexity at this stage,
expecially as it would introduce a further constant, namely a slip coefficient.
Furthermore, setting 3.16 =0 does not mean that the consumption is zero;
it just means that the latent heat release for the flux (slag) is small compared
to the heat conduction.
Lastly, the text does not imply that the right terms in 3.16,3.20 and 3.23
are set to zero:
• 3.16 has been discussed already
• 3.20 has no latent heat term since it is not a phase-change interface
• 3.23 is not in fact being set to zero, as the latent heat release of the
steel solidification is significant (unlike the insignificant latent heat of the
slag/flux)
3
>> 9. Page 7, line 52: Meniscus shall not be at atmospheric pressure due
to slag bed.
We have now added an extra sentence to explain why this is a reasonable
assumption. The slag bed will be no more than a centimetre in height as seen, for
example, in the detailed computations of Ramirez-Lopez et al (2012), which will
contribute a pressure head no greater that 2930*10*0.01˜ 293 Pa. Compared
to the atmospheric pressure, 105 Pa, the difference is to all intents and purposes
negligible.
>> 10. Table of properties: Ks(s) seems too high for steel (reference re-
quired). slag viscosity of 0.5 Pa-s is the upper limit on casting.
We have now taken a value of 30 W m-1 K-1 from Fig. 3(a) in Mills et
al. (ref. 14). This value is quite representative of both low alloy and austenitic
stainless steels over the temperature range that we are dealing with. We have
re-done our calculations with this new value.
>> Slag viscosity of 0.5 Pa-s is the upper limit on casting. Casting speed of
0.0045 m/s=0.27 m/min is unrealistic.
These were the values used by Hill et al. Since one purpose of this paper
is to analyze their model in more detail, we have no choice but to make use of
their data.
>> 11. Rms = Rmf = 2x10-4seems to make a huge difference in heat flux by
several orders of magnitude with small increases in R. Biot number as defined
in the paper requires R as one of the main values (after Eq 4.8) and the effect
of R propagates to the whole model. Biot assumption is not correct since Biot
number exceeds 100 in the best case which makes the assumption of Newton
cooling invalid.
This is a somewhat confused statement, although we will do our best to
address it:
• It is not clear to us that “Rms = Rmf = 2x10-4 seems to make a huge
difference in heat flux by several orders of magnitude with small increases
in R”. In equation (4.8), it is clear that the quantity mR appears and
its size is O (1) for the values of m and R being used. Moreover, we have
1+mR in the denominator, which will be the quantity that determines
how the heat flux behaves, and it is difficult to see how small increases in
R would lead to an order of magnitude difference in heat flux. E.g. a 10%
increase in R from 2 × 10-4 to 2.2 × 10-4 would mean that 1/(1 + mR)
decreases from 0.333 to 0.3125, affecting the heat flux by less around
100%×(0.333-0.3125)/0.333 ˜ 6%.
• What is the “Biot assumption”? There is only the Biot number which
is a generally accepted dimensionless number. Note that the way Bi is
normally defined, i.e. taking into account just the heat transfer coefficient
at the water/mould boundary, would give the value that the referee is ex-
pecting, but here the quantity we have defined does not take into account
4
just that effect; it also involves the contact resistance at the other mould
wall and the 1D heat conduction in the mould itself (see next bullet).
• The referee appears to believe that we have assumed Newton cooling
straight off, but this wasn’t the case. In fact, eq. 3.8 - which ultimately
becomes eq. 4.8 - was derived by considering 1D heat transfer from the
cold water stream, through a thermal boundary at the pipe surface (mod-
elled via the heat coefficient m) and through the mould to the surface at
x = 0. The analysis is analogous to that on pages 1621-2 in Vynnycky
(2009).
>> 12. Page 12, line 37. Little or No superheat assumption is wrong.
We would certainly agree with the referee that continuous casting is not
carried out in practice at no superheat. However, whether it is wrong to
use/consider a little or no superheat modelling assumption is utmost debatable;
for example, note also that even Jonayat et al., on simulating the experiments
of Shin et al. and Badri et al. state they use “a small superheat temperature
difference”. However, we have at least three concrete reasons for using this
assumption:
• Even if we were to take a superheat as large as 50 K, for example, this
would introduce a dimensionless parameter 50/(Tm,s - Tw ) = 50/(1773 -
300) ˜ 0.03; this is arguably small enough to be neglected, bringing us to
the no superheat case.
• It allows us to make substantial analytical headway, and essentially re-
duces the problem to one for the flux layer and the solid steel, which is
desirable so as to avoid having to model turbulent flow in the melt.
• The fact that we have obtained such good agreement in Fig. 10 indicates
that the assumption is not unreasonable.
We have included a discussion along these lines at the end of the first para-
graph in Section 8.
>> 13. Results section, Figure 5: Data used for Hill’s calculation is non-
realistic (see point 7). Powder consumption under this conditions is off-chart
(4kg/m2) assuming a 1mm film and 1 mm mark depth for a mould of 900 mm
length.
It is difficult to answer this point, since Hill et al. clearly obtain reasonable
oscillation mark profiles, even though the author says that their data in unreal-
istic. We also note that Hill et al. did not use 900 mm for the mould length, but
298 mm. Moreover, our asymptotic analysis shows that it is not this length (L)
which is decisive for the actual oscillation mark profile, as it ultimately drops
out of the analysis and is not present in our analytical closed-form expressions.
5
In fact, we noted that we had forgotten to give the value of L in Table 1 in the
first version, but we have added it now.
Also, it is not clear to us how the referee made his/her calculation to arrive
at 4 kg m-2 , nor what value realistic or not. Jonayat et al. have around 0.2
kg m-2 , but Ramirez-Lopez et al measure consumption in kg s-1 (and have
around 0.01). In addition, Jonayat et al. document consumption in two other
units (g m-1 s-1 and g m-1 cycle-1 ), neither of which are kg s-1 .
>> 13. Figures 6 -8. Agreement of model with oscillation marks measured
experimentally is just logical since boundary conditions provided produce pertur-
bations to create the required OSM profile. However, the model cannot be used
as predictive tool without feeding it with experimental data.
We think that the referee has misunderstood what we have done. The ref-
eree appears to believe that we somehow fixed the thermal boundary conditions
in the model so that we would get good agreement with the experimentally
measured oscillation marks. In fact, this was not the case. We made no par-
ticular assumption on the heat flux at all; what we did is explained in item 4
above. Then, we performed the analysis, determining the oscillation mark pro-
files which turn out to agree well with the experimental result, as shown in Fig.
8. Thus, we have not fed the model with experimental data, and we would claim
that the model can be used as a predictive tool: equation (7.2), which contains
no experimental data but only the physical and operating parameters, predicts
the maximum depth of the oscillation mark, whereas if one were to write equa-
tion (6.54) in dimensional form, one would obtain the complete oscillation mark
profile. This is what was used in Figs. 8 and 10.

REPLY TO REFEREE #3
In order to make it easier to locate the changes made in response to this
reviewer’s comments, we have highlighted the changes in grey.
>> The language is good but I find it difficult to follow the story line since it
feels jumpy. Especially chapters 3-6 (including a-c) needs more explaining text
in the beginning of each chapter as glue to previous chapter. Perhaps the text
about the layout in the introduction chapter (p.2 line 58 – p3 line 50) can be
moved to each chapter?
>> 1. Introduction
What is the purpose of the article? For example, is the purpose of the article
to model oscillation-mark formation by introducing dimensionless parameters?
Or is it to improve the older model introduced by Hill et al. (1999)? Or is
it to introduce a theoretical model that is not so time consuming to use? Or
something else? To have a clear purpose also helps the reader to follow and
understand what you are trying to achieve with the article.
We have now added a sentence on this at the end of the penultimate para-
graph in Section 1: “In summary, then, the purpose of this article is to give a
systematic analysis and understanding of the earlier model by Hill et al. [8],
with a view to providing an experimentally validated theoretical model that is
not so time-consuming to use.”
>> The introduction includes both results and analyses (p.2 line 51-57).
Please separate them from the introduction. Perhaps a pre-study could be in-
cluded.
We have now removed this, but comments equivalent to this can be found
in Section 8; consequently, we have not included a pre-study.
The layout (p.2 line 58 – p3 line 50) is not needed. Instead I think each
chapter should be explained in more detail. Which would make it easier for the
reader to follow and understand all the choices through the article.
In our experience of articles involving theoretical modelling, it is common
practice to have such a layout, and we would prefer to keep it, as it does give
an overview of the whole paper. On the other hand, we have added additional
text at the beginning of some of the subsequent sections, in order to guide the
reader.
>>I think the schematic diagram in Figure 1 (p. 2) is to detailed. A sug-
gestion is that you illustrate the key features about how oscillations marks oc-
curs. Since two different kinds of oscillations marks (overflow-type and fold-type
marks) are mentioned in the article (p.4 line 17-20 and p. 21 line 52-55), show
and explain the difference between them.
The role of Figure 1 is to set the scene, rather than show how oscillation
marks are formed; indeed, there is no mention of oscillation marks in the caption
of this figure. Moreover, such a figure is customary in articles on initial solidi-
fication in continuous casting, e.g. Ramirez-Lopez et al. (2012) and Jonayat et
al. (2014).
7
As regards illustrating key features about how they are formed, we have
added a new Figure 2 and accompanying text around it.
>> 2. Experiment
How many samples were cut out? As I understand you have just done one
experiment, where two oscillation marks were cut out. A recommendation is
to test different settings for the twelve parameters to validate the model with
reality? Perhaps Design of Experiments could be used to investigate possible
interaction effects (correlations) between the parameters.
Whilst the referee’s recommendation is of course a good one, it is unimple-
mentable, as there are no future plans to carry out any further industrial trials.
However, we have added a new Fig. 4 where we document all of the oscillation
marks that were analyzed in the same batch as those used for the later compar-
ison with theory. Further text has been added at the end of Section 2. Also,
the text in the fnal paragraph of Section 7 has also been modified.
In which “Section b)” (p.4 line 22) is the results presented?
Apologies; this should have read Section 7(b). This has now been corrected.
>> 7. Results
The presented results are based on original data from Hill et al. (1999) and
Saleem and Fredriksson (2016). Here I also would like to see the comparison
between the models (Hild et al., 1999 and Saleem and Fredriksson, 2016) in
more detail, for example, with figures or tables. So the reader can make their
own opinion about the results.
In this chapter I would like to have a summary of your twelve dimensionless
parameters. Perhaps like Table 1 (p. 8)?
• Note that Saleem and Fredriksson (2016) has now been replaced by Saleem
(2016), a Ph.D. thesis defended at KTH which can be downloaded by
clicking here, and searching for “Saud Saleem”.
• The referee wants to see a comparison between the results of Hill et al.,
1999 and Saleem and Fredriksson, 2016, and those of this manuscript.
Regarding the former, we have now added the relevant curve from Hill et
al. 1999 onto the new Fig. 6, as well as providing some extra comment at
the start of Section 7(a). Regarding the latter, we point out that Salleem
2016 does not give a model; the work was experimental. What we are doing
is using the data from that experimental work, i.e. Vcast, , V0 , <U+03C9>, µf , in our
model. On the other hand, we have already compared the experimental
data from Saleem 2016 with our model in the new Fig. 10; we have
rewritten the caption for that figure to emphasize this point.
• We have now given a table showing the values of the dimensionless pa-
rameters for each case. However, it was more natural put the table in
8
conjunction with Section 4(c), since characteristic values of these parame-
ters were previously given there. Moreover, we realized that a caveat was
necessary regarding the likely value of K, and this has been given in the
grey text between equations (6.9) and (6.10).
>> 8. Conclusions
>>In this chapter you are saying that your method is valid for both sinu-
soidal and non-sinusoidal mould oscillations (p. 21 line 31-32). But on the
other hand you are saying that the obtained results should also be valid for non-
sinusoidal mould oscillations (p. 17 line 59-60). Is it or should it? What is
correct?
What we mean here is that the expressions that we obtained for H0 in
equation (6.54) and in the equation after (6.55) depend only V; these expressions
hold regardless of whether a sinusoidal function, as in equation (3.2), is used for
V, or non-sinusoidal profiles, such as those developed in refs. 18-20. We have
thus rewritten the text to read:
In addition, we have replaced the “should also be valid” on page 17 by “are
also valid”.
>>I am missing a discussion about how easy/difficult it is to use the model
in reality. For example, how easy/difficult is it to collect and measure the final
twelve parameters?
>>Do you need any basic knowledge to use the model? If yes, what?
The model is very easy to use in reality. As input data, one would need the
operating parameters and the properties of the flux powder and the steel grade
being cast; as regards the powder and the steel grade, this has recently been
facilitated by the publication of two articles (refs. 14 and 22) which we have
now cited. After that, we can note that all of the results shown here are in
terms of closed-form analytical expressions. However, whether the model will
give the same result as an experimental measurement is another matter, and we
have already suggested, both via the title and the discussion in Section 8 in the
first version that the model, in its present form, would only be able to capture
correct behaviour for folding-type marks.
These comments have been added in the third-to-last paragraph in Section
8.

Appendix C
REPLY TO REFEREE #1
>>I urge the authors to add a remark in the first paragraph of section 3,
where $z 0(t)$ is introduced, that knowledge of $z 0(t)$ is irrelevant for the
oscillation mark formation mechanism according to present model. It will be
eliminated by an asymptotic argument following eq. (6.37).
We have now added this comment as requested.
REPLY TO REFEREE #2
>>However, the model refers to fold- type marks and not to overflow marks.
How do you know whether your marks are fold or overflow without carrying out
tests first ?
Certainly, at this stage, we have only come as far as showing that this model
predicts a fold mark correctly, and we would want to go further and in particular
develop a criteria for determining which one occurs when.
>>Given these facts, I am queasy about the assumptions regarding
1. The bed thickness is maintained constant (since the bed is a major player).
2. Assuming the superheat is close to zero (since it is kept high when reducing
OM depths).
I would be interested to hear the author’s comments.
The referee has provided many useful insights to help us in future modelling.
We would say here that:
1. We did not in fact assume that the bed thickness was constant. We gave
an estimate for its thickness based on the computational model of other
authors. This estimate indicates that the pressure head that such a thick-
ness would cause would be negligible in comparison with the atmospheric
pressure. On the other hand, the referee suggests that the bed is of sig-
nificance for heat transfer at a location that was not modelled in this
paper. We would therefore expect to see its significance in a heat transfer
model for the region above the molten steel/slag interface, which would
then, directly or indirectly affect the location of the start of solidification;
however, without actually having a model for this region and doing the
computation, it is difficult to say by how much.
2. We already made a number of comments about our zero-superheat as-
sumption at the top of page 24. In fact, a future extension of the model
could involve the inclusion of a realistic level of superheat; indeed, we indi-
cated the presence of a new dimensionless parameter - the ratio of super-
heat to (Tm,s - Tw ). The solution we have obtained already is the leading
order solution and then we would need to adjust it with the superheat con-
tribution. As the dimensionless parameter appears to be comparatively
small according to our estimate, we would expect to see a small perturba-
tion on the solution that we have obtained already. Extending the analysis
in terms of this parameter could give an idea of how the oscillation marks
are affected by superheat. It would be of utmost interest to actually see,
and compare against, a set of experimental results where the superheat
is changed and the oscillation marks are measured; unfortunately, we did
