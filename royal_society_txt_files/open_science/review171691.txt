This manuscript demonstrates the synthesis of Ag-WO3 composite material for sensing NO2 gas
at elevated temperatures. This work carefully investigates the effects of calcination temperature

on the size, morphology, phase and sensing performance of WO3 and Ag-WO3. The conclusion
of superior sensing property of Ag-WO3 is not fully sound, before more evidence and control
experiments are further needed. Though various WO3 based composites have been developed to
show enhanced gas sensing performance, there are indeed few papers to report the effects of Ag
doping on the sensing performance of WO3. The present work demonstrates the advances of
NO2 gas sensor. The experimental protocols and data analysis are well performed, with
comprehensive characterization. However, I cannot recommend the acceptance of this
manuscript, before some major issues are solved. To fully support the conclusion, the following
issues should be addressed.
1. The experimental details should be as specific as possible. What is the amount of added
AgNO3 solid or solution? What is the pH in the reaction? The authors should indicate which
branch in N2 sorption isotherm was used to determine the pore size distribution. The adsorption
branch is recommended to minimize the tensile strength effect in the pore size distribution plot.
2. In Fig. 3a, the standard XRD cards for hexagonal WO3 (JCPDS 33-1387) and monoclinic WO3
(JCPDS 43-1035) should be included for clear comparison. In Fig. 3b, the XRD pattern of Ag
standard card should be also included.
3. The precise amount of Ag in the Ag-WO3 should be measured by ICP-AES.
4. All of the Celsius symbols are not correctly shown throughout the manuscript. Please check the
correct form.
5. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of all samples should be given in the Electronic
Supplementary Material.
6. To highlight the highest performance of Ag-WO3 calcined at 500 °C, a control sample of the
physical mixture of Ag and WO3 should be tested for sensing NO2. The Ag and WO3
components can be separately synthesized by the similar sol-gel method and calcined at 500 °C.
7. The inset of Fig. 5b is blurry. Please enlarge the font or make it as a separate figure.
8. Some related publications must be cited to support the claims and reflect the development of
gas sensors, encompassing Plasmonics 2017, 12, 1051-1055; Ferroelectrics, 2015, 477, 93-102;

The authors have addressed most of the issues raised by the reviewers. The current manuscript is
improved. However, there are still some issues which need to be addressed before the
manuscript is formally accepted. The following issues should be addressed.
1. The standard XRD cards of WO3 and Ag in Fig. 3 are not very clear. Please enlarge the
intensity and make them clear.
2. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of all samples refer to the isotherms of all control
samples including 300 °C pure WO3, 700 °C pure WO3, 300 °C Ag-WO3 and 700 °C Ag-WO3.
These data should be provided in Electronic Supplement Information PDF.
3. It is surprising that the mixture of Ag and WO3 also showed excellent sensing performance
7
compared with pure WO3. This result brings out a new question. What is the effect of Ag/WO3
ratio in the Ag-WO3 composites and Ag/WO3 mixture on the gas sensing performance?
4. There are still many typos in the manuscript. The authors should scrutinize it. For example, in
Table 1, Ag-WO3 calcined at different temperatures was mistaken. The sentence “Furthermore,
different kinds of doping material and there concentration will make the sensor affected by
humidity differently.” should be checked. The typos are NOT limited in the examples and all
typos should be corrected throughout the manuscript.

Ms. Title: Effects of sintering temperature on sensing properties of
WO3 and Ag-WO3 electrode for NO2 sensor
Firstly, we thank the reviewers very much for the positive
comments and good suggestions on our manuscript. We have
thoroughly revised our manuscript according to the comments and
suggestions. All changes or corrections have been marked in the revised
manuscript. Detailed point-by-point response to the comments is as
follows.
Response to the comments of Reviewer #1
Comment 1
I disagree with the statement that there are few reports on the effects of
sintering on gas sensing properties of WO3 and also on Ag-WO3. A
better search in the literature should be performed with special
emphasis on Ag-WO3. The reference list needs to be improved and
comparison between existing previous results and the new results should
be added.
Response:
Good suggestions. The statement “there are few reports on the
effects of sintering on gas sensing properties of WO3 and also on Ag-
WO3” has been modified as “there is still room for improvement in
stability, selectivity and working temperature of the gas sensor”. The
following references about Ag-WO3 have been cited in the Page 1 in the
revised manuscript.

Comment 2
Error bars (some statistics!) should be added to both panels in Figure
5.
Response:
Good suggestions. Error bars have been added to both panels.
Comment 3
Equations 1 to 4 do not apply simultaneously. They depend on the
operating temperature of the material. Please select those that are
relevant only taking into account the optimal operating temperature of
the sensor (150ºC).
Response:
We thank the reviewer for his/her careful checking on our
manuscript. We all agree with his/her point of this view. Presence of
these oxygen species is decided by the operating temperature. The
oxygen ions predominantly exist in the form of O2- below 100oC, O-
between 100 and 300oC.Above 300oC the O2- are produced and get
directly incorporated into the lattice. When the operating temperature of
the material is 150oC.
Equations 3 do not apply. We have corrected in the revised manuscript.
Comment 4
Figure 6 shows a dynamic response and recovery signal. It is indicated
in the caption that this is the response to 25 ppb of NO2. Is this right.
According to Fig 5 the lowest concentration measured was 250 ppb and
the value of the response in fig 6 seems to match more or less with the
response for 250 ppb. Please clarify or amend if necessary.
Response:
We thank the reviewer for his/her careful checking on our
manuscript. Figure 6 is the response to 250 ppb of NO2, not 25ppb, we
have corrected in the revised manuscript.
Comment 5
Ag-WO3 is surely affected by the presence of ambient moisture. Maybe
a short discussion based on existing literature would suffice, but this
should be added as well.
Response:
Good suggestion. A short discussion based on existing literature
has been made in the revised manuscript. Which has been added in Page
5.
Comment 6
There are a few typos that should be corrected throughout the
manuscript.
Response:
We thank the reviewer for his/her careful checking on our
manuscript. The manuscript has been carefully checked. The typo errors
have been corrected.
Response to the comments of Reviewer #2
Comment 1
This manuscript demonstrates the synthesis of Ag-WO3 composite
material for sensing NO2 gas at elevated temperatures. This work
carefully investigates the effects of calcination temperature on the size,
morphology, phase and sensing performance of WO3 and Ag-WO3. The
conclusion of superior sensing property of Ag-WO3 is not fully sound,
before more evidence and control experiments are further needed.
Though various WO3 based composites have been developed to show
enhanced gas sensing performance, there are indeed few papers to
report the effects of Ag doping on the sensing performance of WO3. The
present work demonstrates the advances of NO2 gas sensor. The
experimental protocols and data analysis are well performed, with
comprehensive characterization. However, I cannot recommend the
acceptance of this manuscript, before some major issues are solved. To
fully support the conclusion, the following issues should be addressed.
Response:
We thank the reviewer very much for his/her positive comments on
our manuscript.
Comment 2
The experimental details should be as specific as possible. What is the
amount of added AgNO3 solid or solution? What is the pH in the
reaction? The authors should indicate which branch in N2 sorption
isotherm was used to determine the pore size distribution. The
adsorption branch is recommended to minimize the tensile strength
effect in the pore size distribution plot.
Response:
Good suggestion. All the experimental details have been described
as specific as possible in new manuscript. 4mL of 0.1mol/L AgNO3
aqueous solution was added to the WO3 precursor solution. The pH
value of the solution was fixed at 4.5 which was adjusted by using nitric
acid (HNO3) solution in the reaction process. Pore diameter distribution
curves in N2 sorption isotherm was used to determine the pore size
distribution. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore
diameter distribution curves has been added in new manuscript as
Figure 5.
Comment 3
In Fig. 3a, the standard XRD cards for hexagonal WO3 (JCPDS 33-
1387) and monoclinic WO3 (JCPDS 43-1035) should be included for
clear comparison. In Fig. 3b, the XRD pattern of Ag standard card
should be also included.

Ms. Title: Effects of sintering temperature on sensing properties of
WO3 and Ag-WO3 electrode for NO2 sensor
Firstly, we thank the reviewers very much for the positive
comments and good suggestions on our manuscript. We have
thoroughly revised our manuscript according to the comments and
suggestions. All changes or corrections have been marked in the revised
manuscript. Detailed point-by-point response to the comments is as
follows.
Response to the comments of Reviewer #2
Comment 1
The authors have addressed most of the issues raised by the reviewers.
The current manuscript is improved. However, there are still some issues
which need to be addressed before the manuscript is formally accepted.
The following issues should be addressed.
Response:
We thank the reviewer very much for his/her positive comments on
our manuscript.
Comment 2
The standard XRD cards of WO3 and Ag in Fig. 3 are not very clear.
Please enlarge the intensity and make them clear.
Response:
Good suggestions. The intensity of the standard XRD cards of
WO3 and Ag has been enlarged in Fig 3.
Comment 3.
The N2 adsorption-desolation isotherms of all samples refer to the
isotherms of all control samples including 300 °C pure WO3, 700 °C
pure WO3, 300 °C Ag-WO3 and 700°C Ag-WO3. These data should be
provided in Electronic Supplement Information PDF.
Response:
Good suggestion. These data(including 300 °C pure WO3, 700 °C
pure WO3, 300 °C Ag-WO3 and 700°C Ag-WO3.) have been provided
in Electronic Supplement Information PDF as shown below.
Comment 4
It is surprising that the mixture of Ag and WO3 also showed excellent
sensing performance compared with pure WO3. This result brings out a
new question. What is the effect of Ag/WO3 ratio in the Ag-WO3
composites and Ag/WO3 mixture on the gas sensing performance?
Response:
Very good question.The possible mechanism can be understood
from the following aspects.
Ag-WO3 composites:Firstly, Ag NPs act as the active sites to
enhance the selective adsoption of NO2 molecules. NO2 is a polar
molecule with positive charge localized on the nitrogen and negative
charge on one of the oxygen atoms, and electron interaction with the Ag
NP will repel the negatively charged oxygen and attract the positively
charged nitrogen.Secondly, the Schottky defects at the interface of Ag-
WO3 can reduce the activation energy and accelerate the reaction
rate,resulting in enhancement of the gas-sensing performance.
Ag/WO3 mixture:In case of the Ag NP-WO3 mixture, both WO3
powder and AgNPs were prepared separately before being mixed
together. On one hand, their surfaces were saturated already by different
chemical species during their syntheses. On the other hand, there must
be contaminant remains in between the Ag and WO3 particles. Therefore,
the spacing between the Ag NP and WO3 particles are too large for
effective Schottky junction formation. Consequently,there is only very
limited improvement in sensor response for the Ag NP-WO3 mixture
compared with Ag-WO3 composites

Comment 5
There are still many typos in the manuscript. The authors should
scrutinize it. For example, in Table 1, Ag-WO3 calcined at different
temperatures was mistaken. The sentence “Furthermore, different kinds
of doping material and there concentration will make the sensor affected
by humidity differently.” should be checked. The typos are NOT limited
in the examples and all typos should be corrected throughout the
manuscript.
Response:
Good suggestion.We are very grateful to the reviewers for their careful
examination.All the typos in the manuscript have been corrected.
