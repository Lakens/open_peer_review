The manuscript reports a study on overimitation in 5-12 year old French and Serbian children.
Children were confronted with the „hook task“: they had to retrieve an object from a jar by
bending an available pipe cleaner into a hook, which enabled to fish for the object and pull it out
of the jar. This presents a difficult task for children under 10 years. The authors explored which
actions children would reproduce when a model demonstrated either one relevant action
(bending the pipe-cleaner into a hook, = control condition) or a nonfunctional and a relevant
action (arranging a string around the jar and then bending the pipe cleaner, = overimitation
condition). Another aim of this study was to explore if potential socioeconomic differences that
French and Serbian children might face, would result in different behavior patterns. The authors
found an overimitation rate (i.e., performing the string action) of 30 % and no effect of country.
Contrary to other studies, they did not find that overimitation increased with age. A surprising
finding was that boys overimitated significantly more than girls in both countries. The authors
discuss this against the background of the evolution of human tool-use culture.
A clearly interesting aspect of this study is the instrumental nature of the task, which makes it
different from many overimitation studies. I also welcome the approach to broaden the range of
populations in which the phenomenon is studied, i.e. the crosscultural aspect, as well as
expanding the age range to older children. Both aspects are timely and contribute to the value of
the study. The study is well documented, a large number of children was tested and the
manuscript was easy to follow.
However, I have a number of concerns regarding the rationale of the study including how the
authors relate their arguments with the existing literature, the conclusions they draw from their
results and the choice of study samples. Taken together, I think the study offers some new and
interesting aspects because of the age range of tested children and the task. However, I am
sceptical about the way the study is theoretically embedded at the moment and whether the
findings hold up considering a potentially unbalanced distribution of conditions (see below).
Theoretical and conceptual remarks:
My first point is that I am concerned about a conceptual confound of task understanding (or
„causal transparency“ of the task) and overimitation. Broadly speaking, overimitation requires
that participants can potentially understand the functional difference between the „relevant
action“ and „irrelevant acton“. However, in this study, only results of those children who were
unsuccessful in the pre-test phase are reported. This means, none of these children had a clear
understanding of the functionality of the relevant action. The task is well suited to study the
ability to acquire tool use knowledge. But since the actions have never been demonstrated, I am
sceptical that what is being measured here actually captures overimitation. The question is: can
something potentially be overimitated that has never been fully demonstrated?
My second point relates to the cross-cultural approach. The authors explain that both Serbian and
French culture are „WEIRD“ cultures but that they might differ in other aspects. They state some
socio-economic differences between Serbia and France (p 6), but I am missing information if the
sample populations actually differed in these aspects. For example, were the Serbian children
from rural areas, do their families or schools have internet access, do they have video games
(even without internet access) and commercial toys, etc. If the populations do not differ in these
aspects, no difference is to be expected and in this case the study should not be introduced as
taking the comparative perspective. As far as I understand, the authors want to predict that
Serbian children might be better at the task because they do not spent so much time with video
games and rather engage in activities that involve tool use and problem solving. But also video
games can promote creative thinking or problem solving skills and thus the argument does not
seem to be very strong, in my opinion. Taken together I do not find the rationale for this specific
3
cross-cultural comparsion very useful, at least given the information that is available in the
current version of the manuscript.
Third, the rationale behind investigating a sex difference should be mentioned in the
introduction. While the finding of a strong sex difference is surprising and potentially interesting,
either a concise hypothesis should be stated in the introduction (derived from the relevant
literature) or the finding should be marked as unexpected but interesting sideline finding worth
pursuing more systematically.
Fourth, the authors put some emphasis on the point that many studies use the classic puzzle box
methodology, which suffers from a potential counfound of the same tool being used for
nonfunctional and functional actions. Although they mention briefly that „a few studies“ have
used different tasks, they present their study to some degree as providing first evidence of an
approach that does not have the tool-confound problem. This is simply not the case. Given that
the authors themselves list a number of studies that either use different tools or no tools at all and
still do find overimitation, I am afraid I do not quite understand the point they want to make.
Also, the authors’ conclusion of the Taniguchi & Sanefuji study (p 4) seems to be exaggerated.
„This recent finding confirms that both the target of the action and the use of a tool are two
important factors needed for overimitation to occur“. Over-imitation rates of >0 when no tools or
visible targets are involved clearly exist, thus tools are not a necessary requirement for
overimitation. I don’t think the tool-confound argument is very solid, at least the way it is
presented at the moment (maybe i am missing a crucial point; in this case I would like to ask the
authors to elaborate on their theoretial argument).
Coding, data and analysis:
Information regarding how overimitation was coded is missing, how strict was the criterion for
overimitation? Was overimitation only codedn when full circle was made with the string? Or was
it sufficient to loosely arrange the string partly around the bottle to be coded as overimitation? Or
only when the circle was closed?
Did the experimenter remain present after demonstrating the action(s)? Just a thought: If yes,
given the very instrumental nature of the task, children might have understood it as a normative
demand to be as instrumentally rational as possible (as a sidenote to the evaluation of a
normative interpretation p 13 line 17ff)
Was there a specific reason to categorize children into 4 age groups (not more or less)? Why are
data collapsed into 3 age groups in the Tables 4 and 5?
Why are there only 80 children in the overimitation condition in the post phase? In the pre-test
spreadsheet there were initially 94 children assigned to this condition. Also, I was wondering if
the children who have been given the condition „successful“ also received a subsequent demo
according to overimitation or control condition? This does not become 100% clear from the
methods description. It would be very interesting to know if formerly successful children
overimitate at a different rate than formerly unsuccessful children (see my comment on causal
transparency below).
The sex bias: Since I was very surprised about the sex difference,
I had a look at the provided data. I was interested if the sex effect could be a consequence of
unequal distribution of conditions. For example, if more older boys received the overimitation
condition but more younger girls received the control condition, this could explain the pattern
equally well. That is because we know that older children have a better understanding of the task
(and might thus have more cognitive capacity to focus on other details) and that overimitation
has been reported to increase with age. I found it surprising that the age did not come out as an
influential predictor for overimitation, given that overimitation rate increases from 12.5 % in the
youngest age group to 46.7 % in the oldest age group (Table S5).
4
Table S5 indicates indeed that relatively more older (i.e., age 9-12) boys than girls and relatively
more younger (i.e., age 5-8) girls than boys have been given the overimitation condition. I had
initially looked at the dataset of the pre-demonstraton phase: in this datasheet the unequal
distribution is even more pronounced (for n=94 children who initially received the overimitation
condition: 38 girls vs. 28 boys in the two youngest age groups but 8 girls vs. 15 boys in the two
oldest age groups). I was wondering 1) what happened with the 14 children that are not
considered in the final overimitation sample, as only 10 children have been reported to be
excluded and 2) if the sex difference could rather be a consequence of an unbalanced assignment
of control and overimitation conditions. I suggest to include a sex*age interaction in the model.
Relating to my comment on task experience (see below), I also suggest to include success as a
predictor in the model.
Discussion:
P 12/13: last/first sentence. This is really not new and already younger children can learn from
failed or unfinished attempts (->imitation) and can infer goals from actions. Why should children
of different social upbringings differ in this respect? Please elaborate. The idea that different
schooling or different encouragement received depending on cultural background is very
interesting, but does relate to other mechanisms than the more basic process of goal inference
from actions.
P13 line 10: Please rephrase. Everything that we perceive is somehow cognitively „processed“.
Children at much younger ages have been shown to imitate rationally, hence this is nothing in
which the current results add news to the literature on rational or selective imitation.
P 13: while the „same tool for both actions“ argument is a very interesting idea, the authors
should relate this more extensively to the existing studies of overimitation in which this did not
apply but still high levels of overimitation were found (see my remark above).
P 13 l 25ff: the current study differs from other overimitation studies in that it is not entirely clear
how „causally transparent“ the activity is to the children. Rather than „priorizing efficiency over
overimitation“ it could be that children infer different goals from new vs. old information (see
e.g. Carpenter, Call, & Tomasello, 2005; Southgate, Chevallier, & Csibra 2009). Against this
possibility it would be very interesting to explore if children of the same age group who have
been successful in the pre-test overimitate more than the unsuccessful ones. For the latter, both
the hook bending and the string actions are new information and they might prioritize the goal-
related action; while for the former only the string action is new and so they might assign higher
relevance to it than the unsuccessful children and therefore include it more frequently.
P 14/15: As far as I know, it is not clear whether reported sex differences between boys and girls
regarding play behavior could merely be a consequence of different treatment and behavior
enforcement from their environment (parents, teachers, commercials, etc). But even if this cultural
component leads to differences in play behavior, this does not necessarily predict that boys and
girls pay differnt attention to the stimulus materials when they are the only available objects
around them.
Title: is not very informative (male-biased sex difference could go both ways).
Taken together, I think this is an interesting study, but might need reframing regarding the
theoretical rationale and a more careful formulation of conclusions.
I hope the authors find my comments helpful and constructive.

This manuscript reports a cross cultural study of innovation and overimitation. The study
employs a task which simultaneously assesses overimitation and innovation within a large
sample of French and Serbian children. The authors report similar effects across cultures and use
this evidence to imply that effects are stable across socioeconomic backgrounds.
The main findings showed that only 30% of children innovated a tool when given a standard
hook task, and the propensity to innovate increased with age. Not until 9-10 years of age did the
majority of children pass this task without demonstration. The remainder of children were then
split into two groups, with one group given a simple demonstration of making a hook, and the
other group given a demonstration of an irrelevant action and hook making. Of those children
given the irrelevant action demonstration, 30% copied the irrelevant action. There was a gender
difference in this propensity to overimitation, with males overimitating more often than females.
Overall, I found that this paper was well written and it clearly communicated the motivations,
methods and results. However, I have a number of issues with the study design which may have
impacted the results.
1. Embedding the overimitation task in an innovation task may have skewed the samples. I see
the logic in examining innovation and overimitation concurrently in order to assess how these
learning styles sit together within development. However, by conducting the innovation task
first, and removing the children who innovated from the overimitation condition, the authors
bias the sample. It could be that children who are able to innovate are also more likely to
overimitate. A number of previous studies have shown that overimitation increases with age but
presumably, a large number of the older children in the sample did not complete the
overimitation condition because they innovated. This could also explain why the rates of
overimitation in this task (30%) was significantly lower than is found in more traditional
overimitation studies (65%).
2. It was not clear how the children who did not innovate were selected for the overimitation or
simple demonstration conditions. Was this done randomly? It would be useful to report the
participant demographics of these two groups as they are presumably not representative of the
whole sample due to exclusion because of innovation.
6
3. I am not sure why the authors chose to include the simple demonstration condition as these
data are not presented or discussed.
4. The justification of the comparison to Serbian culture seems a bit post hoc. For example, the
link between having an internet connection, playing video games, and lack of innovation seems a
little speculative.
5. The statistics about Serbian families are based on rural households and it is not specified
whether the Serbian participants came from rural or urban areas so this link needs to be made
clearer.
6. Did the authors collect any data on the socioeconomic status of the individuals within the
samples? Or information about schooling differences? The authors state that they “examined
whether cultural variations between France and Serbia in terms of schooling and socioeconomic
status could affect innovation and overimitation” but the differences between participant groups
on these dimensions are not reported.
Minor points
1. The authors should include clear statements of their hypotheses regarding culture, imitation
and innovation.
2. The second half of the first paragraph on page 14 “Another possible explanation includes…” is
unclear about what is being explained and doesn’t seem to make a particular point. Especially as
the authors conclude the paragraph suggesting that the point “fails to explain the sex bias”. I
suggest that it is removed.

The manuscript reports a study on overimitation in 5-12 year old French and Serbian children.
Children were confronted with the „hook task“: they had to retrieve an object from a jar by

of the jar. This presents a difficult task for children under 10 years. The authors explored which

French and Serbian children might face, would result in different behavior patterns. The authors
found an overimitation rate (i.e., performing the string action) of 30 % and no effect of country.
Contrary to other studies, they did not find that overimitation increased with age. A surprising
finding was that boys overimitated significantly more than girls in both countries. The authors
discuss this against the background of the evolution of human tool-use culture.
A clearly interesting aspect of this study is the instrumental nature of the task, which makes it
different from many overimitation studies. I also welcome the approach to broaden the range of
populations in which the phenomenon is studied, i.e. the crosscultural aspect, as well as
expanding the age range to older children. Both aspects are timely and contribute to the value of

However, I have a number of concerns regarding the rationale of the study including how the

interesting aspects because of the age range of tested children and the task. However, I am
sceptical about the way the study is theoretically embedded at the moment and whether the
findings hold up considering a potentially unbalanced distribution of conditions (see below).
Theoretical and conceptual remarks:
My first point is that I am concerned about a conceptual confound of task understanding (or
„causal transparency“ of the task) and overimitation. Broadly speaking, overimitation requires
that participants can potentially understand the functional difference between the „relevant
action“ and „irrelevant acton“. However, in this study, only results of those children who were
unsuccessful in the pre-test phase are reported. This means, none of these children had a clear
understanding of the functionality of the relevant action. The task is well suited to study the
ability to acquire tool use knowledge. But since the actions have never been demonstrated, I am
9
sceptical that what is being measured here actually captures overimitation. The question is: can
something potentially be overimitated that has never been fully demonstrated?
My second point relates to the cross-cultural approach. The authors explain that both Serbian and
French culture are „WEIRD“ cultures but that they might differ in other aspects. They state some
socio-economic differences between Serbia and France (p 6), but I am missing information if the
sample populations actually differed in these aspects. For example, were the Serbian children
from rural areas, do their families or schools have internet access, do they have video games
(even without internet access) and commercial toys, etc. If the populations do not differ in these
aspects, no difference is to be expected and in this case the study should not be introduced as

Serbian children might be better at the task because they do not spent so much time with video
games and rather engage in activities that involve tool use and problem solving. But also video
games can promote creative thinking or problem solving skills and thus the argument does not
seem to be very strong, in my opinion. Taken together I do not find the rationale for this specific
cross-cultural comparsion very useful, at least given the information that is available in the
current version of the manuscript.
Third, the rationale behind investigating a sex difference should be mentioned in the
introduction. While the finding of a strong sex difference is surprising and potentially interesting,
either a concise hypothesis should be stated in the introduction (derived from the relevant
literature) or the finding should be marked as unexpected but interesting sideline finding worth

the hook bending and the string actions are new information and they might prioritize the goal-

relevance to it than the unsuccessful children and therefore include it more frequently.
P 14/15: As far as I know, it is not clear whether reported sex differences between boys and girls
regarding play behavior could merely be a consequence of different treatment and behavior
11
enforcement from their environment (parents, teachers, commercials, etc). But even if this cultural
component leads to differences in play behavior, this does not necessarily predict that boys and
girls pay differnt attention to the stimulus materials when they are the only available objects
around them.
Title: is not very informative (male-biased sex difference could go both ways).
Taken together, I think this is an interesting study, but might need reframing regarding the
theoretical rationale and a more careful formulation of conclusions.
I hope the authors find my comments helpful and constructive.

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript reports a cross cultural study of innovation and overimitation. The study
employs a task which simultaneously assesses overimitation and innovation within a large
sample of French and Serbian children. The authors report similar effects across cultures and use
this evidence to imply that effects are stable across socioeconomic backgrounds.
The main findings showed that only 30% of children innovated a tool when given a standard
hook task, and the propensity to innovate increased with age. Not until 9-10 years of age did the
majority of children pass this task without demonstration. The remainder of children were then
split into two groups, with one group given a simple demonstration of making a hook, and the
other group given a demonstration of an irrelevant action and hook making. Of those children
given the irrelevant action demonstration, 30% copied the irrelevant action. There was a gender
difference in this propensity to overimitation, with males overimitating more often than females.
Overall, I found that this paper was well written and it clearly communicated the motivations,
methods and results. However, I have a number of issues with the study design which may have
impacted the results.
1. Embedding the overimitation task in an innovation task may have skewed the samples. I see
the logic in examining innovation and overimitation concurrently in order to assess how these
learning styles sit together within development. However, by conducting the innovation task
first, and removing the children who innovated from the overimitation condition, the authors
bias the sample. It could be that children who are able to innovate are also more likely to
overimitate. A number of previous studies have shown that overimitation increases with age but
presumably, a large number of the older children in the sample did not complete the
overimitation condition because they innovated. This could also explain why the rates of
overimitation in this task (30%) was significantly lower than is found in more traditional
overimitation studies (65%).
2. It was not clear how the children who did not innovate were selected for the overimitation or
simple demonstration conditions. Was this done randomly? It would be useful to report the
participant demographics of these two groups as they are presumably not representative of the
whole sample due to exclusion because of innovation.
3. I am not sure why the authors chose to include the simple demonstration condition as these
data are not presented or discussed.
4. The justification of the comparison to Serbian culture seems a bit post hoc. For example, the
link between having an internet connection, playing video games, and lack of innovation seems a
little speculative.
5. The statistics about Serbian families are based on rural households and it is not specified
whether the Serbian participants came from rural or urban areas so this link needs to be made
clearer.
12
6. Did the authors collect any data on the socioeconomic status of the individuals within the
samples? Or information about schooling differences? The authors state that they “examined
whether cultural variations between France and Serbia in terms of schooling and socioeconomic
status could affect innovation and overimitation” but the differences between participant groups
on these dimensions are not reported.
Minor points
1. The authors should include clear statements of their hypotheses regarding culture, imitation
and innovation.
2. The second half of the first paragraph on page 14 “Another possible explanation includes…” is
unclear about what is being explained and doesn’t seem to make a particular point. Especially as
the authors conclude the paragraph suggesting that the point “fails to explain the sex bias”. I
suggest that it is removed.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
I have carefully read through the revised manuscript and I appreciate the inclusion of additional
sampling details. I still have a number of concerns which I feel need to be addressed before I can
recommend this manuscript for publication.
1) I do not feel like my point regarding sampling bias for the overimitation part of the study has
been adequately addressed. Removing those who innovated from the overimitation study is
likely to have removed those children who have a better task understanding (as the authors now
discuss). However, there are a multitude of other dimensions upon which those children might
be different – (e.g. the degree to which they engage in social learning, for instance). This should
be clearly marked as a caveat of the present study.
2) I am still confused about the logic for conducting a comparison between French and Serbian
children, and the manuscript seems a little conflicted also. In the introduction, the authors
suggest that quality of schooling and limited access to manufactured toys may play a role in
innovation and imitation however, the hypotheses state that there will be no cultural difference.
Given the lack of demographic information about the specific children in the samples, I think all
the authors can really say about the culture dimension is that this is exploratory and extends the
findings to an unstudied culture so far.
3) On a more general note, the revised manuscript seems much less focused and structured than
the original submission. I recommend that the authors try to clearly lead the reader through their
logic of how this study provides a new contribution to the field.
4) Ln 344 the children never saw a demonstration of the use of the hook, amend wording of this
sentence accordingly.
5) Ln 367 potential typo in number of children in overimitation condition – should in be 23 out of
80, not 25?
6) Ln 398-400 my understanding is that most overimitation studies have included gender as a
control variable and found no effect – use citations to support your broad claim that few studies
have given little attention to sex differences. If previous studies have not found gender effects
14
then it seems like the present finding is the anomaly.
7) Ln 409 I’m not convinced by this argument – children are still supported by parents, even if
they are taught using a different pedagogy, or have limited schooling.
8) Ln 417-418 the present study does not speak to selectivity or flexibility in overimitation as it
does not demonstrate conditions in which it may be selected for or against.
9) Ln 507 overimitation is not rational or selective in its very nature – this should be reworded.

Review of RSOS-170367.R1
Reviewer 1: Stefanie Keupp
The manuscript reports a study on overimitation in 5-12 year old French and Serbian
children. Children were confronted with the „hook task“: they had to retrieve an object
from a jar by bending an available pipe cleaner into a hook, which enabled to fish for
the object and pull it out of the jar. This presents a difficult task for children under 10
years. The authors explored which actions children would reproduce when a model
demonstrated either one relevant action (bending the pipe-cleaner into a hook, = control
condition) or a nonfunctional and a relevant action (arranging a string around the jar
and then bending the pipe cleaner, = overimitation condition). Another aim of this study
was to explore if potential socioeconomic differences that French and Serbian children
might face, would result in different behavior patterns. The authors found an
overimitation rate (i.e., performing the string action) of 30 % and no effect of country.
Contrary to other studies, they did not find that overimitation increased with age. A
surprising finding was that boys overimitated significantly more than girls in both
countries. The authors discuss this against the background of the evolution of human
tool-use culture.
A clearly interesting aspect of this study is the instrumental nature of the task, which
makes it different from many overimitation studies. I also welcome the approach to
broaden the range of populations in which the phenomenon is studied, i.e. the cross
cultural aspect, as well as expanding the age range to older children. Both aspects are
timely and contribute to the value of the study. The study is well documented, a large
number of children was tested and the manuscript was easy to follow.
However, I have a number of concerns regarding the rationale of the study including
how the authors relate their arguments with the existing literature, the conclusions they
draw from their results and the choice of study samples. Taken together, I think the
study offers some new and interesting aspects because of the age range of tested
children and the task. However, I am sceptical about the way the study is theoretically
embedded at the moment and whether the findings hold up considering a potentially
unbalanced distribution of conditions (see below).
Theoretical and conceptual remarks:
We have addressed all the theoretical and conceptual remarks in the following.
My first point is that I am concerned about a conceptual confound of task
understanding (or „causal transparency“ of the task) and overimitation. Broadly
speaking, overimitation requires that participants can potentially understand the
functional difference between the „relevant action“ and „irrelevant action“. However,
in this study, only results of those children who were unsuccessful in the pre-test phase
are reported. This means, none of these children had a clear understanding of the
functionality of the relevant action. The task is well suited to study the ability to acquire
tool use knowledge. But since the actions have never been demonstrated, I am sceptical
that what is being measured here actually captures overimitation. The question is: can
something potentially be overimitated that has never been fully demonstrated?
Thank you for this interesting comment. We agree that overimitation requires individuals to
differentiate between relevant and irrelevant actions. However, we do not think that because
unsuccessful children failed to figure out that one tool had to be modified (relevant action) in
order to be functional during the pre-demonstration phase, it necessarily ensues that they did
not obtain a clear understanding of the functionality of the relevant action during the post-
demonstration phase. Firstly, it is worth noting that Table S8 indicates that a large majority of
successful but also unsuccessful children used essentially the pipe cleaner over the string
during the pre-demonstration phase. This shows that most children understood that the
relevant tool to retrieve the bucket was the pipe cleaner, although they often failed to figure
out that this tool needed to be modified. Secondly, the high rate of success in the post-
demonstration phase (88% in all conditions, Table S10) indicates that after seeing the
experimenter bending the pipe cleaner, most children understood the functionality of this
relevant action (with a bent pipe cleaner, it is now possible to retrieve the bucket with the use
of the hook (functionality of the relevant action)). This understanding was constant across the
conditions as we noted the same high rate of success between the two conditions (90% for the
Control condition and 86% for the Overimitation condition, information now provided in
Table S10) and illustrated by a non-significant effect of the condition in our model
investigating success during the post-demonstration phase (Table 3). Finally, only one child
in the Control condition touched the string when trying to retrieve the reward (Table S10),
which indicated that when children saw the modification of the pipe cleaner, they directly
inferred that the relevant aspect of this tool over the string. Therefore, it seems that whatever
the condition they were assigned to, children understood the functionality of the actions after
receiving a demonstration.
Regarding the last question more specifically, as stated in our Introduction (L85-L94), in a
previous study, Nielsen (2013) found that in a demonstration including relevant and
irrelevant actions (i.e., pouring water into the bottle containing a reward and into small cups
beside the bottle) that does not show the final solution (i.e., only pouring enough water to
make the reward floating but still inaccessible), children still engaged in overimitation. This
study indicates that an irrelevant action can be overimitated even though this action is
embedded in sequence of actions that does not lead to a clear outcome.
My second point relates to the cross-cultural approach. The authors explain that both
Serbian and French culture are „WEIRD“ cultures but that they might differ in other
aspects. They state some socio-economic differences between Serbia and France (p 6),
but I am missing information if the sample populations actually differed in these
aspects. For example, were the Serbian children from rural areas, do their families or
schools have internet access, do they have video games (even without internet access)
and commercial toys, etc. If the populations do not differ in these aspects, no difference
is to be expected and in this case the study should not be introduced as taking the
comparative perspective. As far as I understand, the authors want to predict that
Serbian children might be better at the task because they do not spent so much time
with video games and rather engage in activities that involve tool use and problem
solving. But also video games can promote creative thinking or problem solving skills
and thus the argument does not seem to be very strong, in my opinion. Taken together I
do not find the rationale for this specific cross-cultural comparison very useful, at least
given the information that is available in the current version of the manuscript.
We apologize for the lack of precisions regarding our cross-cultural approach. We initially
tried to collect socio-economic information via questionnaires in both France and Serbia.
However, most were incomplete or not returned in due time so, unfortunately, we are not able
to provide socio-demographic data in our analyses.
Nevertheless, we are now providing more information regarding the different places in
France and Serbia in where our study took place. Based on the field experience of one of the
authors (who has spent several months in Serbia) and facts available in recent public surveys
that corresponds to the places, this information can be found in our Introduction (L147-L166)
and the ‘Participants’ section in our Methods (L185-L199).
We also apologize for the lack of clarity regarding our predictions that come along with this
cross-cultural comparison. Given our samples demographics and based on the few cross-
cultural data available on innovation and (over)imitation, we actually predicted no differences
between French and Serbian children regarding these behaviours, which would underline the
universality of both the difficulties of children to be innovative and their aptitude to engage in
imitation from a young age across cultures. Our different hypotheses and predictions can now
be found at the end of our Introduction (L168-L179).
Third, the rationale behind investigating a sex difference should be mentioned in the
introduction. While the finding of a strong sex difference is surprising and potentially
interesting, either a concise hypothesis should be stated in the introduction (derived
from the relevant literature) or the finding should be marked as unexpected but
interesting sideline finding worth pursuing more systematically.
Our study was unfortunately not designed to investigate a sex effect during overimitation but
to cross-culturally investigate innovation and overimitation with the use of an ecological task
including different tools. Moreover, no other studies had reported such an effect so far and as
a result, there was no initial reason to predict a difference based on the sex of the children. As
such, we are now presenting this finding as unexpected and as one which opens up avenues
for future studies to shed light on our understanding of overimitation and, more broadly, on
how human tool culture evolved (L396, L462 and L503-L507).
Fourth, the authors put some emphasis on the point that many studies use the classic
puzzle box Methodology, which suffers from a potential confound of the same tool being
used for nonfunctional and functional actions. Although they mention briefly that „a
few studies“ have used different tasks, they present their study to some degree as
providing first evidence of an approach that does not have the tool-confound problem.
This is simply not the case. Given that the authors themselves list a number of studies
that either use different tools or no tools at all and still do find overimitation, I am
afraid I do not quite understand the point they want to make. Also, the authors’
conclusion of the Taniguchi & Sanefuji study (p 4) seems to be exaggerated. „This
recent finding confirms that both the target of the action and the use of a tool are two
important factors needed for overimitation to occur“. Over-imitation rates of >0 when
no tools or visible targets are involved clearly exist, thus tools are not a necessary
requirement for overimitation. I don’t think the tool-confound argument is very solid,
at least the way it is presented at the moment (maybe i am missing a crucial point; in
this case I would like to ask the authors to elaborate on their theoretical argument).
We apologize for these approximations regarding our tool-confound argument and after re-
reading and considering the existent literature, We have applied Reviewer 1’s comments to
this section and made a number of modifications (L94-114). Our goal with this list of the
different overimitation studies was to give the reader a clear overview of what past
overimitation studies have done (e.g., material used, population studied, type of actions
demonstrated, rate of overimitation found) and to underline areas of potential confounds.
We have removed the terms ‘essentially’ (L76) and provided an estimation of the number of
studies relying on this paradigm. We have also modified our description of the studies, which
do not rely on this paradigm (see L82-L85) and we discuss several studies that have
addressed the tool-confound problem. This way, we believe that we will not induce the reader
to understand our study as being the first overcoming the tool-confound problem. We are
now presenting our study as the first that looks at overimitation in a naturalistic problem-
solving task in which several tools are potentially utilisable and in which children first
experience a failure when trying to retrieve the reward (L106-L114 and L139-L142).
Coding, data and analysis:
Information regarding how overimitation was coded is missing, how strict was the
criterion for overimitation? Was overimitation only coded when full circle was made
with the string? Or was it sufficient to loosely arrange the string partly around the
bottle to be coded as overimitation? Or only when the circle was closed?
We apologize for this lack of clarity. We coded children as overimitators if the string was the
first tool touched before being used to make a full and close circle around the bottle. We are
now presenting this information in the ‘Coding’ section of our Methods (L273-L275).
Moreover, after checking our video-recordings, it appeared that one French child (ID56)
started to make a circle around the bottle but stopped and put the string beside the bottle. We
therefore removed this child from the children considered as overimitators.
Did the experimenter remain present after demonstrating the action(s)? Just a thought:
If yes, given the very instrumental nature of the task, children might have understood it
as a normative demand to be as instrumentally rational as possible (as a side note to the
evaluation of a normative interpretation p 13 line 17ff)
We apologize for this missing information. The experimenter remained present in the post-
demonstration phase. This information is now presented in our ‘Material and procedure’
section of our Methods (L263-L264) and its potential applications are further discussed in our
Discussion (L432-L434).
Was there a specific reason to categorize children into 4 age groups (not more or less)?
Why are data collapsed into 3 age groups in the Tables 4 and 5?
We categorized the children of our study into four age groups to have a sufficient number of
children in each age condition for our categorical analyses when further exploring the age
effect (already previously isolated in the model as a continuous variable) on success during
the pre-demonstration condition. This information is now provided in our new ‘Data analysis’
section in our Methods (L296-L301).
The data were collapsed into 3 age groups in Table 4 and 5 because of the few number of
unsuccessful children falling into the 11-12 year old category (n = 11), all conditions
confounded. We therefore grouped them with the 9-10 year old category (n = 27) to have
more comparable categories in terms of number of children (5-6 year old: n = 50; 7-8 year
old: n = 53; 9-12 year old: n = 38) and clearer data in our different tables when this sample
was divided according to the condition and cultural background. This information is now
provided in the ‘Post-demonstration phase – Success’ in our Results (L344-L349).
Why are there only 80 children in the overimitation condition in the post phase? In the
pre-test spreadsheet there were initially 94 children assigned to this condition. Also, I
was wondering if the children who have been given the condition „successful“ also
received a subsequent demo according to overimitation or control condition? This does
not become 100% clear from the Methods description. It would be very interesting to
know if formerly successful children overimitate at a different rate than formerly
unsuccessful children (see my comment on causal transparency below).
We have detailed why there were only 80 children in the overimitation while there were
initially 94 in the ‘Participants’ section in our Methods (L203-L212). We tested a total of 235
children. However, we removed 8 children with missing demographic information, 10 who
did not use any tools during the pre-demonstration phase as they were either too shy and did
not listen to the feedback of the experiment, 1 who succeeded in the pre-demonstration
condition by luck and without intentionally bending 1 due an experimental error (child not
prompted a second time) and 8 children aged 4 years old.
We apologize for the lack of clarity regarding the fact that successful children were presented
or not with a demonstration. As now mentioned in the ‘Material and procedure’ section in our
Methods (L252-L255), if children were successful, they were told that they could keep the
reward for themselves and that the experiment was finished for them. We agree that it would
be interesting in a future study to investigate whether successful children, given their
different experience with the task, would overimitate at different rates than unsuccessful
children. We are now addressing this in our Discussion (L445-L460).
The sex bias: Since I was very surprised about the sex difference, I had a look at the
provided data. I was interested if the sex effect could be a consequence of unequal
distribution of conditions. For example, if more older boys received the overimitation
condition but more younger girls received the control condition, this could explain the
pattern equally well. That is because we know that older children have a better
understanding of the task (and might thus have more cognitive capacity to focus on
other details) and that overimitation has been reported to increase with age. I found it
surprising that the age did not come out as an influential predictor for overimitation,
given that overimitation rate increases from 12.5 % in the youngest age group to 46.7 %
in the oldest age group (Table S5).
Table S5 indicates indeed that relatively more older (i.e., age 9-12) boys than girls and
relatively more younger (i.e., age 5-8) girls than boys have been given the overimitation
condition. I had initially looked at the dataset of the pre-demonstration phase: in this
datasheet the unequal distribution is even more pronounced (for n=94 children who
initially received the overimitation condition: 38 girls vs. 28 boys in the two youngest
age groups but 8 girls vs. 15 boys in the two oldest age groups). I was wondering 1) what
happened with the 14 children that are not considered in the final overimitation sample,
as only 10 children have been reported to be excluded and 2) if the sex difference could
rather be a consequence of an unbalanced assignment of control and overimitation
conditions. I suggest to include a sex*age interaction in the model. Relating to my
comment on task experience (see below), I also suggest to include success as a predictor
in the model.
Thank you for this remark on task understanding. We agree on the point made and we are
now addressing this in our Discussion (L445-L460).
Regarding the null of effect of age, we ran the model again after having removed one child
(ID56) who does not fit the criterion to be considered as overimitators (see comments above,
Table 3). To avoid any loss of information regarding this factor, the variable ‘age’ entered in
our model was continuous (in months) and not categorical, however, this factor was still non-
significant (p = .274).
For 1), what happened with the 14 children who are not considered in the final overimitation
sample is detailed above and in the ‘Participants’ section in our Methods (L203-L212).
For 2), this is an interesting point that we are now discussing in our Discussion (L475-L487)
and when considering the second dataset ‘post-demonstration overimitation’ or Table S10,
we clearly see that there is an unequal distribution (5-6: 11 boys and 13 girls; 7-8: 14 boys
and 20 girls; 9-12: 14 boys and 7 girls). However, it appears to us unlikely that our general
sex effect may be due to this unequal distribution because when considering the two youngest
groups, in particular the 7-8 group in which only 4 out of 20 girls overimitated while half the
boys within the same age group did overimitate (7 out of 14). This result, similar to what we
observed for the older age category, indicates that even though the distribution is unequal, our
sex bias remained stable.
As can be seen in Table S2, S3 and S4 we have included all possible interactions (including
the sex*age interaction) in the model and all were non-significant. Similarly, when including
the variable ‘success’ as a predictor in the model, there is only an effect of age (with all
interactions: Table S5, p = .010; without interactions: Table S6, p = .008).
Discussion:
P 12/13: last/first sentence. This is really not new and already younger children can
learn from failed or unfinished attempts (->imitation) and can infer goals from actions.
Why should children of different social upbringings differ in this respect? Please
elaborate. The idea that different schooling or different encouragement received
depending on cultural background is very interesting, but does relate to other
mechanisms than the more basic process of goal inference from actions.
We apologise for this misunderstanding. We actually predicted that French and Serbian
children would not differ regarding goal inference from actions (see our Introduction, L177-
L179). We have added ‘as expected’ (L411) to make our claim clearer in our Discussion.
P13 line 10: Please rephrase. Everything that we perceive is somehow cognitively
„processed“. Children at much younger ages have been shown to imitate rationally,
hence this is nothing in which the current results add news to the literature on rational
or selective imitation.
We have removed this sentence from our Discussion.
P 13: while the „same tool for both actions“ argument is a very interesting idea, the
authors should relate this more extensively to the existing studies of overimitation in
which this did not apply but still high levels of overimitation were found (see my remark
above).
We are now discussing this presenting this point in our Introduction (L100-114) and we have
modified how we address it in our Discussion (L416-L443).
P 13 l 25ff: the current study differs from other overimitation studies in that it is not
entirely clear how „causally transparent“ the activity is to the children. Rather than
„priorizing efficiency over overimitation“ it could be that children infer different goals
from new vs. old information (see e.g. Carpenter, Call, &Tomasello, 2005; Southgate,
Chevallier, &Csibra 2009). Against this possibility it would be very interesting to
explore if children of the same age group who have been successful in the pre-test
overimitate more than the unsuccessful ones. For the latter, both the hook bending and
the string actions are new information and they might prioritize the goal-related action;
while for the former only the string action is new and so they might assign higher
relevance to it than the unsuccessful children and therefore include it more frequently.
Thank you for this interesting point. We are now discussing the potential effect of ‘task
understanding’ on our low rate of overmitation in our Discussion (L445-L460).
P 14/15: As far as I know, it is not clear whether reported sex differences between boys
and girls regarding play behavior could merely be a consequence of different treatment
and behavior enforcement from their environment (parents, teachers, commercials,
etc). But even if this cultural component leads to differences in play behavior, this does
not necessarily predict that boys and girls pay differnt attention to the stimulus
materials when they are the only available objects around them.
We have removed this part on playing but kept the fact that boys use more tools when solving
problems as a potential explanation of our gender effect, particularly in light of the findings
in chimpanzees (L492-L495).
Title: is not very informative (male-biased sex difference could go both ways).
We have changed the title in making clear in which way goes the male-biased sex difference
(L1-L2).
Taken together, I think this is an interesting study, but might need reframing regarding
the theoretical rationale and a more careful formulation of conclusions.
I hope the authors find my comments helpful and constructive.
We thank you very much for all these helpful comments and suggestions.

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript reports a cross cultural study of innovation and overimitation. The
study employs a task which simultaneously assesses overimitation and innovation within
a large sample of French and Serbian children. The authors report similar effects across
cultures and use this evidence to imply that effects are stable across socioeconomic
backgrounds.
The main findings showed that only 30% of children innovated a tool when given a
standard hook task, and the propensity to innovate increased with age. Not until 9-10
years of age did the majority of children pass this task without demonstration. The
remainder of children were then split into two groups, with one group given a simple
demonstration of making a hook, and the other group given a demonstration of an
irrelevant action and hook making. Of those children given the irrelevant action
demonstration, 30% copied the irrelevant action. There was a gender difference in this
propensity to overimitation, with males overimitating more often than females.
Overall, I found that this paper was well written and it clearly communicated the
motivations, Methodss and results. However, I have a number of issues with the study
design which may have impacted the results.
We have addressed all the point in the following.
1. Embedding the overimitation task in an innovation task may have skewed the
samples. I see the logic in examining innovation and overimitation concurrently
in order to assess how these learning styles sit together within development.
However, by conducting the innovation task first, and removing the children
who innovated from the overimitation condition, the authors bias the sample. It
could be that children who are able to innovate are also more likely to
overimitate. A number of previous studies have shown that overimitation
increases with age but presumably, a large number of the older children in the
sample did not complete the overimitation condition because they innovated.
This could also explain why the rates of overimitation in this task (30%) was
significantly lower than is found in more traditional overimitation studies (65%).
We agree with this comment and we are now addressing this point regarding the potential
effect of ‘task understanding’ on our low rate of overmitation in our Discussion (L445-L460).
2. It was not clear how the children who did not innovate were selected for the
overimitation or simple demonstration conditions. Was this done randomly? It
would be useful to report the participant demographics of these two groups as
they are presumably not representative of the whole sample due to exclusion
because of innovation.It would be useful to report the participant demographics
of these two groups
We apologize for this lack of clarity. The assignment of unsuccessful children to one of the
post-demonstration conditions has been made on a random basis. This information has been
rephrased and can be now found in ‘Material and procedure’ in our ‘Methods’ section
(L256).
As suggested, we are now providing the participant demographics for the two post-
demonstration conditions in Table S9 of our Supplemental Material.
3. I am not sure why the authors chose to include the simple demonstration
condition as these data are not presented or discussed.
We apologize for this lack of information. We decided to present some unsuccessful children
with a simple demonstration (or Control condition) to make sure that these children would
not use the string as an exploratory behaviour and that the performance of an irrelevant action
would not change the rate of success of unsuccessful children assigned to the Overimitation
condition. These results are now provided in the Table S7 of our Supplemental Material,
presented in ‘Post-demonstration phase – Control versus Overimitation in our ‘Results’
section (L364-L368).
4. The justification of the comparison to Serbian culture seems a bit post hoc. For
example, the link between having an internet connection, playing video games,
and lack of innovation seems a little speculative.
We apologize for this lack of clarity. One of our goals with this experiment was to test two
populations, taking advantage of one of authors’ connections in Serbia. This cross-cultural
aspect was, therefore, included from the start. Nevertheless, because a recent study by
Nielsen et al. (2014) found no difference between WEIRD and non-WEIRD samples, we did
not expect any differences between our French and Serbian regarding innovation. This is now
made clearer in our predictions at the end of our Introduction (L168-L179). We stress the two
cultures in our article in light of the unexpected sex effect that we found overall and was
present in the two populations. We believe this is a finding which must be stressed as it
shows that it is not an effect that results from the characteristics of one particular population.
In effect, our two tested populations differed importantly in their quality of life and,
nevertheless, displayed the same sex effect. We are now presenting demographic information
about our Serbian sample more thoroughly at the end of our Introduction (L147-L166) and in
the ‘Participants’ section in our Methods (L185-L199).
5. The statistics about Serbian families are based on rural households and it is not
specified whether the Serbian participants came from rural or urban areas so
this link needs to be made clearer.
We apologize for this lack of clarity. Our Serbian children came from rural areas in Eastern
Serbia. We are now presenting this aspect in more details (localisation of the places, number
of inhabitants, characteristics of the schools and the places) in the ‘Participants’ section in our
Methods (L185-L192).
6. Did the authors collect any data on the socioeconomic status of the individuals
within the samples? Or information about schooling differences? The authors
state that they “examined whether cultural variations between France and
Serbia in terms of schooling and socioeconomic status could affect innovation
and overimitation” but the differences between participant groups on these
dimensions are not reported.
We apologize for the lack of precisions regarding our cross-cultural approach. We initially
tried to collect socio-economic information via questionnaires in both France and Serbia.
However, most were incomplete or not returned in due time so, unfortunately, we are not able
to provide socio-demographic data in our analyses. Nevertheless, we have provided more
information regarding the different locations in France and Serbia where our study took place
in our Introduction (L147-L166) and the ‘Participants’ paragraph in our Methods (L185-
L188). Additionally, as the field experience of one of the authors (who has spent several
weeks in Serbia) corresponds to the facts available in recent public surveys, we cite these
surveys to illustrate the socioeconomic differences between France and Serbia.
Minor points
1. The authors should include clear statements of their hypotheses regarding
culture, imitation and innovation.
We have included clear statements regarding our predictions at the end of the Introduction
(L168-L179).
2. The second half of the first paragraph on page 14 “Another possible explanation
includes…” is unclear about what is being explained and doesn’t seem to make a
particular point. Especially as the authors conclude the paragraph suggesting
that the point “fails to explain the sex bias”. I suggest that it is removed.
As suggested, we have removed this paragraph from our Discussion.
We thank you very much for all these helpful comments.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have addressed all points raised regarding the first version of the
manuscript. I find the study is now much better embedded in the existing literature and
rationale and predictions are much clearer stated. The thorough revision significantly
improved the manuscript and I enjoyed reading the current version. I have no further
concerns and would like to congratulate the authors for a very nice job.
We thank Reviewer 1 for these congratulations. We are glad that our modifications filled her
expectations, and we believe the manuscript has been much improved by her comments and
theoretical suggestions.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
I have carefully read through the revised manuscript and I appreciate the inclusion of
additional sampling details. I still have a number of concerns which I feel need to be
addressed before I can recommend this manuscript for publication.
We thank Reviewer 2 for these news comments on our manuscript. We have addressed them
in the following.
1) I do not feel like my point regarding sampling bias for the overimitation part of the
study has been adequately addressed. Removing those who innovated from the
overimitation study is likely to have removed those children who have a better task
understanding (as the authors now discuss). However, there are a multitude of other
dimensions upon which those children might be different – (e.g. the degree to which
they engage in social learning, for instance). This should be clearly marked as a caveat
of the present study.
Thank you for this remark and we apologize for not addressing fully Reviewer 2’s point
regarding the exclusion of successful children in the pre-demonstration task. We now clearly
present the removal of the successful children in the pre-demonstration phase (innovative task)
as a caveat of our study and discuss the consequences; for example this might have caused
the low rates of overimitation we observed (L469-476).
2) I am still confused about the logic for conducting a comparison between French and
Serbian children, and the manuscript seems a little conflicted also. In the introduction,
the authors suggest that quality of schooling and limited access to manufactured toys
may play a role in innovation and imitation however, the hypotheses state that there will
be no cultural difference. Given the lack of demographic information about the specific
children in the samples, I think all the authors can really say about the culture
dimension is that this is exploratory and extends the findings to an unstudied culture so
far.
We apologise for the conflicted aspect regarding our cross-cultural comparison between
French and Serbian children. However, in the paragraph preceding our hypotheses, we
previously indicated why we expected no cultural difference. Concerning the limited access
to manufactured toys, we indicated that although this would lead children to rely more on
imagination and creativity, this would not lead to more innovation in experimental tasks
overall (L-157-160). Similarly, previous cross-cultural research has shown that only non-
formal education would lead to variations in the appearance of overimitation (see Nielsen,
Mushin, Tomaselli & Whiten, 2014; Berl & Hewlett, 2015), therefore our comparison
between France and Serbia only allowed us to confirm that formal teaching may play an
important role in the developmental appearance of overimitation. Difference in the quality of
formal schooling, however, may still have a role that needs to be investigated.
To make this clearer, we have rephrased the sentence as ‘our comparison would also allow
evaluating whether variations in this particular form of teaching influenced overimitation
rates across cultures’ (L162-163) and indicated that our cross-cultural comparison would
extent the different previous cross-cultural findings to a quite unstudied culture (L163-166).
3) On a more general note, the revised manuscript seems much less focused and
structured than the original submission. I recommend that the authors try to clearly
lead the reader through their logic of how this study provides a new contribution to the
field.
This comment contrasts with the general comments of Reviewer 1. While we believe the
current version is more embedded in the existing literature and rationale and predictions are
better stated, as previously recommended by Reviewer 1, we have tried to finalize our
manuscript to make it clearer overall.
4) Ln 344 the children never saw a demonstration of the use of the hook, amend
wording of this sentence accordingly.
We agree with Reviewer 2 that the children, while observing the making of the hook, did not
observe the use of the hook. We have amended the sentence ‘after seeing how to make a
functional hook’ (L345).
5) Ln 367 potential typo in number of children in overimitation condition – should in be
23 out of 80, not 25?
We apologise for this lack of clarity. There wasn’t a typo in number as we meant the number
of children who overimitated among the children who touched or used the pipe cleaner
(L369-370). However, the phrasing ‘assigned to this condition’ (L367-368 in the initial
version) was confusing. We have therefore removed this part of the sentence.
6) Ln 398-400 my understanding is that most overimitation studies have included
gender as a control variable and found no effect – use citations to support your broad
claim that few studies have given little attention to sex differences. If previous studies
have not found gender effects then it seems like the present finding is the anomaly.
We apologise for this imprecision. We have modified this part of the manuscript (L406-
412).We are now referring to our detailed literature review in our Supplemental Material
(Table S1) in which about 18/30, 60%, did not mention any sex/gender variable in their
results (‘not reported’ in the column ‘Sex difference’ and a previous claim made by Kenward
(2012): ‘[…] because there is no prior reason to suspect gender effects in this design […]’ (p.
198). We have also added the reference McGuigan (2013) which is the only reporting a sex
effect linked with the sex of the model (confounding variable) during overimitation.
7) Ln 409 I’m not convinced by this argument – children are still supported by parents,
even if they are taught using a different pedagogy, or have limited schooling.
We apologise for this lack of development regarding our reasoning. We have developed our
argument regarding why these children could show better innovative abilities than children
attending formal teaching, citing a publication showing that they have better self-regulation
and creative abilities (Lillard & Else-Quest, 2006) (L419-423). Nevertheless, we also
acknowledge that other factors, such as parenting style, may also have an influence.
8) Ln 417-418 the present study does not speak to selectivity or flexibility in
overimitation as it does not demonstrate conditions in which it may be selected for or
against.
We have rephrased this sentence by replacing ‘is flexible and selective’ by ‘is not automatic’
(L432).
9) Ln 507 overimitation is not rational or selective in its very nature – this should be
reworded.
We have removed the words ‘rational selective’ (L522).

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
This revision is much improved and the authors have now addressed my major concerns.
I have only a few minor comments remaining:
Abstract ln 40 typo – lightS should be light
Change made at L40.
Ln 329 – 333 if the interaction between culture and age was not significant (and thus
removed from the model) then it is not necessary to report the intra age group
comparisons between French and Serbian children.
We agree with Reviewer 2 and we have removed this section from our manuscript.
Ln 351 – typo in age groups – should be 5-to-6, not 5-7
Change made at L345.
Ln 353 – 356 as above – if the interaction is not significant then the intra age group
cultural comparisons should not be run or reported.
We agree with Reviewer 2 and we have removed this section from our manuscript.
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review this interesting work.
We thank you for all your relevant comments, which have significantly improved the quality of
