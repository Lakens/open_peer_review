The manuscript “NiS submicron cubes with efficient electrocatalytic activity as the counter
electrode of dye-sensitized solar cells” (Manuscript ID: RSOS-180186) shows an easy
hydrothermal method to compose the novel NiS submicron cubes single crystal grains for the
first time. The NiS submicron cubes show excellent electrocatalytic activity and presented
superior photovoltaic performance when it is used as electrocatalytic material of counter
electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells. The low cost NiS submicron cubes grains show efficient
electrocatalytic ability to triiodide reduction and good electron conductivity, and the NiS
submicron cubes could be a kind of efficient electrocatalytic material with special cubic
morphology as alternatives to the traditional Pt in DSSCs. All the datas in the manuscript
(including the SEM, the XRD and the electrochemical characterizations) about the NiS submicron
cubes are well explained with convincing results. Therefore, I recommend the publication of the
manuscript after minor revision listed below:
Page 2 line 34: "electron conductivity" instead of "electric conduction".
Page 2 line 35: "electron " instead of "electrical"
Page 5 line 28: Replace "EIS" with "the EIS".

Page 5 line 56: Eliminate “and NiS submicron cubes-400 electrode”
Page 5 line 57: Replace "cubes-400" with "cubes ", the meaning would be more be logical and
would be more clear.

<U+F0B7> Response:
We do appreciate the reviewer’s comments, recommendation and the kind suggestions.
1. Following Reviewer’s suggestion, we have described it in the text as: “As one of the
most important part of DSSC, the CE was used to transmit electrons and promote the
regeneration of I- from I3-, this essential function need the CE possessing excellent
electron conductivity and outstanding electrocatalytic activity at the same time.
2. Following Reviewer’s suggestion, we have described it in the text as: “As one of the
most important part of DSSC, the CE was used to transmit electrons and promote the
regeneration of I- from I3-, this essential function need the CE possessing excellent
electron conductivity and outstanding electrocatalytic activity at the same time”.
3. Following Reviewer’s suggestion, we have described it in the text as:“The EIS of
different electrodes were shown in Fig. 4 and the parameters from the EIS were
summarized in Table 1”.
4. Following Reviewer’s suggestion, we have described it in the text as: “The RCT of the
NiS submicron cubes electrode is 5.06 O, which means that the NiS submicron cubes
electrode provide a more excellent electrocatalytic activity”.
5. Following Reviewer’s suggestion, we have described it in the text as: “In the case of
the NiS submicron cubes-400 electrode, the RCT was further reduced to 2.99 O”.
6. Following Reviewer’s suggestion, we have described it in the text as: “To further
investigate the catalytic activities of the CEs, the Tafel curves were measured in the
symmetric cell (CE-CE cell) configuration which consists of two identical CE”.
7. Following Reviewer’s suggestion, we have described it in the text as: “The Tafel curve
based on the NiS submicron cubes electrode shows a relative higher J0 and Jlim compared
with the Pt electrode”.
8. Following Reviewer’s suggestion, we have described it in the text as: “The higher J0
and Jlim mean that the NiS submicron cubes electrode has better catalytic activity for the
I3- reduction”.

12. How about the recyclability of the designed system for solar cells?
<U+F0B7> Response:
We do appreciate the reviewer’s comments and the constructive suggestions.
1. Following Reviewer’s suggestion, we have added the description in the
abstract part as: “The counter electrode composed of the NiS submicron cubes
could up to the photovoltaic efficiency of 6.4%, showing the superior
performance compared with the typical Pt electrode (which with the
corresponding conversion efficiencies of 5.3% at the same condition). ”
2. Following Reviewer’s suggestion, we have described it in the text as: “Enen
though, the RS of the NiS submicron cubes electrode based on FTO is a little
big compared with the large block of NiS or the metal based counter
electrode[7,11] , this also means that there is still the space to further improve
the conductivity of NiS electrode and correspondingly to improve the
photovoltaic efficiency. The NiS submicron cubes electrode is important in
that it offers a new low cost counter electrode with novel cubic morphology.”
(First paragraph, pages 4).
3. Following Reviewer’s suggestion, we have added some the references in the
introduction part as following: “It was found that the morphology and the
structure of the relevant material affect its catalytic properties greatly
[40-47].”
4. We appreciate the Reviewer’s suggestion. Following Reviewer’s suggestion,
we have added the source(company name, country) of all chemicals/materials
in the experimental sections, the changes are highlighted with yellow
background in the revised manuscript.
5. In the preparation process of NiS, in fact we did a series of experiments by
changing the synthesis temperature, reagent dosage and hydrolysis time.
Based on these experiments we discovered the proper method to compose the
NiS submicron cubes by the hydrothermal method.
6. Following Reviewer’s suggestion, we have added the description in the text
as: “We found that along with the hydrothermal time increases, the diameter of
the NiS submicron cubes could gradually increase, and the growth mechanism
of the grains is likely to be the hydrothermal growth of NiS submicron cubes
accompanied by the dissolution of smaller NiS grains.” (First paragraph, pages
3)
7. Following Reviewer’s suggestion, we have added the description in the text
as: “The main difference between the diffractions in Figure 2 is that the
intensity of the peaks were reduced after the NiS submicron cubes were
sintered for 1 h at 400<U+2103> in the argon atmosphere. This is probably because
the high temperature could lead to some potential signs of phase transition in
the crystal structure, which leads to a little decrease in the crystallinity of the
NiS powder. ” (Second paragraph, pages 3)
8. The Reviewer’s opinion is understood. Following Reviewer’s suggestion,
we have added the EDS spectrum of the NiS submicron cubes in the
Supplementary Materials (see Fig.S2), this EDS spectrum could help to
determine the elemental composition of the NiS. The selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) have been shown in the TEM images (Fig.1), which
clearly shows the single crystal electron diffraction pattern of the hexagonal
NiS, see Fig. 1e and Fig. 1f. And the SAED patterns of the samples in the
TEM images are consistent with the parameters of the XRD patterns shown in
Fig. 2. These characterization data could determine the crystal structure of
NiS.
9. The Reviewer’s require and concern is reasonable. We think the overall
average quantum yield of the synthesized NiS materials is proportional to the
overall photovoltaic efficiency (<U+03B7>), which actually have been described in the
text (the third paragraph, pages 3) as “When using the NiS submicron cubes
electrode as the counter electrode, the corresponding <U+03B7> is 5.9%, showing the
superior performance compared with the Pt electrode. When using the NiS
submicron cubes-400 electrode as the counter electrode, the corresponding <U+03B7>
was further increased to 6.4%”. Such a description has been able to reflect the
average quantum efficiency of the NiS materials relative to the platinum.
10. The point is understood. But actually, the almost same problem that is
repeated in this question and the eighth question, and please see the response
of the eighth question. In addition, the electrical characterizations (I-V
characteristics) have already been given in the paper (see Fig.3).
11. Following Reviewer’s suggestion, we have added the description in the
text as: “The relative trend of these parameters indicates that the catalytic
performance of NiS electrode is superior to that of Pt electrode, which is
similar with that reported in the literature [12, 30].” (First paragraph, pages 5)
12. The question put forward by the reviewer is very forward-looking and
practical. The solar cells with the NiS material as the counter electrode could
have a long service life which is compared with the platinum. After the service
life is end, all parts of the photovoltaic module should first be dismantled
separately, and then the heavy metals and iodine elements should be recovered
separately in order to facilitate the recycling of materials.
Thanks again for reviewer’s comments and suggestions.
Thank you and look forward to the comments from you and the reviewers.
Sincerely yours,
