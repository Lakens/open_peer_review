The authors describe a straightforward synthesis of cananodine from bromopicoline over 10
steps. The route is novel and I recommend acceptance of this manuscript after addressing the
following minor corrections:
Regarding the key step, the Suzuki coupling, were intramolecular “Heck” byproducts ever
observed? might be worth commenting on as a related transformation was used to synthesisze a
related target, as noted in your introduction.
Regarding the RCM- did the authors try any other conditions? The authors suspect that the
modest yield is a result of competing cross-metathesis. Thus lowering the concentration may be
helpful to increase this yield. Was cross-metatheis (dimerization) explicitly observed? this would
be worth commenting on in the text.
Regarding the NaBH4 reduction: …“would present one more chiral carbon” This is an awkward
way of saying the reduction was not diastereoselective. Please rephrase as such.

The hydrogenation step to the natural product: the text should state the diastereoselectivity of
this process, even if non-diastereoselective.

Comments to the Author:
The authors have done a good job of addressing all of the concerns raised by the previous review.
I just have one final suggested modification before final acceptance. At the end of the first
paragraph of Section 2, the authors say they chose a "racemic route". Chirality is a molecular
property and the relative proportions of stereoisomers is a property of the collection. A synthetic
route cannot be chiral, achiral, or racemic. Changing the word "racemic" to "nonstereoselective"
would be better.

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-172037.R1)
Dear Thomas Foley, Dear Dr Andrew Harned,
Thanks for your consideration and acceptance of manuscript.
We agree the word "nonstereoselective" is more appropriate than "racemic" to describe a
synthetic route, thus the sentence of the first paragraph of Section 2 was revised accordingly.
Other minor mistakes were also corrected and marked in blue.

Society Open Science
is manuscript describes the synthesis of the guaipyridine alkaloid rupestine G and all of its
isomers in a sequence of nine steps and a respectable overall yield. The authors assert the
ines are important synthetic targets due to their scarcity from natural sources and their potential
vity based on their structural similarity to the anticancer alkaloid cananodine. Beginning with
available 3-bromopyridine, key steps of the synthesis include a decarboxylative Blaise
n, Suzuki coupling, and a RCM to form the seven-membered ring of the skeleton. The final step
synthesis is a non-selective hydrogenation that produces four stereoisomers. The
isomers were separated by preparative chiral HPLC before characterization. Absolute
urations are supported by comparison of experimental CD spectra with calculated ones. A
pancy between the optical rotation of natural rupestine G and that of the synthetic material was
ssed and explained based on low sample concentration for the natural material. NMR spectra
thetic compounds are clean enough to establish compound purity, taking into account
unds 9-13 have some enol content, with 13 existing predominantly in enol form.
veral issues must be addressed, however, before this paper is publishable.
me additional discussion of optical rotation is needed. Based on a rotation of -64 for rupestine
), the rotation of 5B should be +64 but it is reported in the experimental section as +47.
rly, the rotations of 5C and 5D should be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. They are
ed as +17 and -35, however. Optical rotation is admittedly sensitive to trace impurities, but the
s should discuss this more.
e introduction is reasonably thorough, but not referenced completely. The Heck strategy of the
n group does not appear in the Tetrahedron Lett. paper that describes the epoxide opening
To date the only report of the Heck route is a poster abstract: Grosslight, S.; Spargo, H.;
n, P.; Vyvyan, J. R. “Synthetic studies on guaipyridine alkaloids: Rupestines B-D and G,”
cts of Papers, 253rd ACS National Meeting & Exposition, San Francisco, CA, United States,
-6, 2017, ORGN-823.
the structures of the rupestines given in the supporting information, rupestines N, O and P have
en reported before. Is there a paper in press that describes their isolation? Furthermore,
ines K and O were given the same structure in the figure. The same error exists for the
res of rupestines D and P. I suspect an additional carbon was inadvertently added to the
re of rupestine N, since it is shown with a four-carbon side chain at C8 instead of the three
side chain of all the other rupestines.
e experimental section has problems. No IR absorptions are given for any of the reported
unds. Enough IR data to establish functional groups should be provided. In many entries, only
gnificant figure is given for compound masses. This is deplorable in the age of inexpensive top-
g balances that measure to four decimal places. Moreover, the use of significant figures is
istent within many entries. One quick example: in the description of the preparation of 8, 2.1 g
SCN (2 sig figs) should be given as 22 mmol (2 sig figs), not 21.6 mmol (3 sig figs), and
ylamine should be 16 mmol (not 16.2 mmol) since the volume (2.2 mL) was only given to 2 sig
his is a problem throughout the experimental section. If only one significant figure is used for
of isolated product, yields should only have one sig fig also. Again from the preparation of 8 as
mple, isolating 0.9 g (1 sig fig) of product is an 80% yield (1 sig fig), not 85% (2 sig figs). In the
ation of 13, the Grubbs catalyst should be described in mol% as well number of mmol.
ammar is another significant problem with this paper. A native speaker of English should edit it.
of the more significant problems are given here:
icles (a, an, the, etc.) are missing throughout the manuscript. In the abstract, “intramolecular
is redundant. Ring-closing metathesis has to be intramolecular by definition, so saying “RCM”
cient. In the Introduction, the word “veritable” is not used correctly. I think the authors meant
y”, “significant”, or “important”. In the first sentence of the Results and Discussion section, the
are” is missing between “rupestines” and “usually”. At the end of that same paragraph, it should
-asymmetric (no –ally on the end). The word “four” should be used in place of 4.
the caption to Scheme 3, the term should be retrosynthetic – not retrosynthetical. Below
e 3, “Wilmer K.” should be deleted. Later in that paragraph “harboured favourably” does not
sense. One could say instead, “…product favored enol form 13 rather than the keto form 12.” In
xt sentence, remove the word “was” before “probably”. The phrase “In a word,” is used
ctly in the last sentence of that paragraph.
the legend to Scheme 4, the end should be Hexane (not –ene)/EtOH (v/v=98:2) (not 98:1).
the overall yield as 18.9% is improper use of significant figures – it should be given as 19%. In
ragraph describing the separation of the stereoisomers, the word should be “respectively” not
ctfully”. In the Conclusion section, Blaise is misspelled. Again, the word “four” should be used in
of the number 4. There is a word missing in that sentence also. It should probably read
mers and their structures were fully CHARACTERIZED by 1H, 13C …”
xperimental text” should be deleted at the beginning of the Experimental section. I am not going
il every grammatical issue from the experimental section, but an expert in English should edit it.
milarly, there are a number of errors capitalization in the references but I will not detail them all
summary, this is an important paper that should be published, but only after significant revisions
lined above. I would recommend the paper be reviewed again after changes are made.
Appendix B
Dear Prof. James Moore and Reviewers,
Thanks for your kind consideration on our manuscript. We appreciated for the precious time you spent
on reviewing our manuscript and truly indebted to kind suggestions you provided.
I am sorry we did make several mistakes, especially those mistakes in grammar in first version of the
manuscript, which are now corrected and marked in red in the revised manuscript. Please refer to the
clause-by-clause rebuttal of the comments.
We appreciate your kind consideration on our manuscript again and look forward to hearing from you
soon.
RSC Subject Editor:
The overall work would be a welcome addition to the journal and the referee comments are reasonable.
Based on the nature of the referee comments, a major revision seems warranted.
Color in Schemes 1-3 is not needed and should be removed. Along similar lines, I suggest a better
placement for atom labels 10 and 11 in Figure 1 and Scheme 4.
Our reply:
Color in Schemes 1-3 is removed. Labels 10 and 11 in Figure 1 and Scheme 4 was changed to a better
position.
Review 1:
This manuscript describes the synthesis of the guaipyridine alkaloid rupestine G and all of its
stereoisomers in a sequence of nine steps and a respectable overall yield. The authors assert the
rupestines are important synthetic targets due to their scarcity from natural sources and their potential
bioactivity based on their structural similarity to the anticancer alkaloid cananodine. Beginning with
readily available 3-bromopyridine, key steps of the synthesis include a decarboxylative Blaise reaction,
Suzuki coupling, and a RCM to form the seven-membered ring of the skeleton. The final step of the
synthesis is a non-selective hydrogenation that produces four stereoisomers. The stereoisomers were
separated by preparative chiral HPLC before characterization. Absolute configurations are supported by
comparison of experimental CD spectra with calculated ones. A discrepancy between the optical rotation
of natural rupestine G and that of the synthetic material was addressed and explained based on low
sample concentration for the natural material. NMR spectra of synthetic compounds are clean enough to
establish compound purity, taking into account compounds 9-13 have some enol content, with 13
existing predominantly in enol form.
Several issues must be addressed, however, before this paper is publishable.
Some additional discussion of optical rotation is needed. Based on a rotation of -64 for rupestine G (5A),
the rotation of 5B should be +64 but it is reported in the experimental section as +47. Similarly, the
rotations of 5C and 5D should be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. They are reported as +17 and
-35, however. Optical rotation is admittedly sensitive to trace impurities, but the authors should discuss
this more.
Our reply:
We re-purified our samples to remove any possible impurities and solvents, and re-measured the optical
rotation carefully several times to ensure that the results are more reliable. Now the rotation of
rupestine G (5A) is -41, while the rotation of 5B is +39. After further purification, the rotation of 5C and
5D measured as +17 and -18, respectively.
The introduction is reasonably thorough, but not referenced completely. The Heck strategy of the
Vyvyan group does not appear in the Tetrahedron Lett. paper that describes the epoxide opening work.
To date the only report of the Heck route is a poster abstract: Grosslight, S.; Spargo, H.; Shelton, P.;
Vyvyan, J. R. “Synthetic studies on guaipyridine alkaloids: Rupestines B-D and G,” Abstracts of Papers,
253rd ACS National Meeting & Exposition, San Francisco, CA, United States, April 2-6, 2017, ORGN-
823.
Our reply:
The Heck strategy of the Vyvyan group reported in a conference abstract of 253rd ACS National Meeting
& Exposition, and also in the dissertation of one of his postgraduate. We now cite the two references.
In the structures of the rupestines given in the supporting information, rupestines N, O and P have not
been reported before. Is there a paper in press that describes their isolation? Furthermore, rupestines K
and O were given the same structure in the figure. The same error exists for the structures of rupestines
D and P. I suspect an additional carbon was inadvertently added to the structure of rupestine N, since it
is shown with a four-carbon side chain at C8 instead of the three carbon side chain of all the other
rupestines.
Our reply:
Rupestine N, O and P have been isolated by our group in 2012 and reported in a doctoral dissertation
(Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, CAS), we make it as a citation in our paper that
time. After carefully examination, we fixed the structural errors mentioned above.
The experimental section has problems. No IR absorptions are given for any of the reported compounds.
Enough IR data to establish functional groups should be provided. In many entries, only one significant
figure is given for compound masses. This is deplorable in the age of inexpensive toploading balances
that measure to four decimal places.
Our reply:
IR absorptions are measured and provided in the revised manuscirpt now.
Moreover, the use of significant figures is inconsistent within many entries. One quick example: in the
description of the preparation of 8, 2.1 g of TMSCN (2 sig figs) should be given as 22 mmol (2 sig figs),
not 21.6 mmol (3 sig figs), and trimethylamine should be 16 mmol (not 16.2 mmol) since the volume
(2.2 mL) was only given to 2 sig figs. This is a problem throughout the experimental section. If only one
significant figure is used for mass of isolated product, yields should only have one sig fig also. Again
from the preparation of 8 as an example, isolating 0.9 g (1 sig fig) of product is an 80% yield (1 sig fig),
not 85% (2 sig figs). In the preparation of 13, the Grubbs catalyst should be described in mol% as well
number of mmol.
Our reply:
Significant figures are recalculated carefully. We now used three significant figures throughout the
manuscript. Grubbs catalyst was described as suggested.
Grammar is another significant problem with this paper. A native speaker of English should edit it.
Our reply:
We apologize for the grammar mistakes we made. A native speaker checked the manuscript and
Some of the more significant problems are given here:
Articles (a, an, the, etc.) are missing throughout the manuscript. In the abstract, “intramolecular RCM”
is redundant. Ring-closing metathesis has to be intramolecular by definition, so saying “RCM” is
sufficient. In the Introduction, the word “veritable” is not used correctly. I think the authors meant
“worthy”, “significant”, or “important”.
Our reply:
Necessary articles (a, an, the, etc.) are added now. Intramolecular RCM was really redundant and is
revised. “Veritable” was changed to worthy.
In the first sentence of the Results and Discussion section, the word “are” is missing between
“rupestines” and “usually”. At the end of that same paragraph, it should be non-asymmetric (no –ally on
the end). The word “four” should be used in place of 4. In the caption to Scheme 3, the term should be
retrosynthetic – not retrosynthetical. Below Scheme 3, “Wilmer K.” should be deleted. Later in that
paragraph “harboured favourably” does not make sense. One could say instead, “…product favored enol
form 13 rather than the keto form 12.” In the next sentence, remove the word “was” before “probably”.
The phrase “In a word,” is used incorrectly in the last sentence of that paragraph.
Our reply:
All the mistakes are corrected as suggested by the reviewer.
In the legend to Scheme 4, the end should be Hexane (not –ene)/EtOH (v/v=98:2) (not 98:1). Giving
the overall yield as 18.9% is improper use of significant figures – it should be given as 19%. In the
paragraph describing the separation of the stereoisomers, the word should be “respectively” not
“respectfully”. In the Conclusion section, Blaise is misspelled. Again, the word “four” should be used in
place of the number 4. There is a word missing in that sentence also. It should probably read
“…isomers and their structures were fully CHARACTERIZED by 1H, 13C …”

All the mistakes are corrected as suggested by the reviewer.
“Experimental text” should be deleted at the beginning of the Experimental section. I am not going to
detail every grammatical issue from the experimental section, but an expert in English should edit it.
Similarly, there are a number of errors capitalization in the references but I will not detail them all here.
Our reply:
“Experimental text” was deleted at the beginning of the Experimental section. This part was carefully
checked, and errors of capitalization in the references were corrected.
In summary, this is an important paper that should be published, but only after significant revisions
as outlined above. I would recommend the paper be reviewed again after changes are made.
Our reply:
Once again we thank for your kind comments on our manuscript. It it our lucky to have you review our
paper again.
Reviewer 2
The authors describe a straightforward synthesis of cananodine from bromopicoline over 10 steps. The
route is novel and I recommend acceptance of this manuscript after addressing the following minor
corrections:
Regarding the key step, the Suzuki coupling, were intramolecular “Heck” byproducts ever observed?
might be worth commenting on as a related transformation was used to synthesisze a related target, as
noted in your introduction.
Our reply:
Checked our experimental records and repeated the reaction again, we have to concluded that we did
not isolate any minor byproduct in this reaction. Sorry we can not provided more information regarding
this issue.
Regarding the RCM- did the authors try any other conditions? The authors suspect that the modest yield
is a result of competing cross-metathesis. Thus lowering the concentration may be helpful to increase
this yield. Was cross-metatheis (dimerization) explicitly observed? this would be worth commenting on
in the text.
Our reply:
We tried several conditions in this step, lower concentration of 13 were helpful for a higher yield. After
evaluation of conditions, we find the appropriate concentration of 13 was 0.12M, and obtained the
highest yield as 53.3%. Unfortunately, we did not isolated any dimerization products.
Regarding the NaBH4 reduction: …“would present one more chiral carbon” This is an awkward way of
saying the reduction was not diastereoselective. Please rephrase as such.
Our reply:
Although NaBH4 reduction was not diastereoselective, the resulted tertiary alcohol would be dehydrated
to give the diene, which was then reduced to give non-chiral carbon. Therefore, we don’t like to
emphasis the stereoselectivity.
The hydrogenation step to the natural product: the text should state the diastereoselectivity of this
process, even if non-diastereoselective.
Our reply:
As mentioned in the next paragraph, the hydrogenation give two diastereoisomers (31.0 mg and 10.6
mg), i.e. 74.5%/25.5% of the two pairs of isomers.
Is the email address correct? -- @yaboo.com? yahoo?
Our reply:
The correct address should be :guozheng.huang@yahoo.com, sorry for the typo.
“non-asymmetrically synthetic scheme” – do you mean a racemic route? awkward phrasing please
reword as such.
Our reply:
We changed to a racemic route
“was probably resulted” poor english here. please reword.
Our reply:
We changed to “The moderate but still acceptable yield of RCM reaction probably was the result of an
undesired intermolecular reaction”
