In this manuscript, authors reported a quantitative detection of Ethyl carbamate (EC) using
surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy with flower-shaped silver nanostructure substrates and
silver nanocubes substrates. The proposed method behaved good analytical performance for EC
with a wide linear range and displayed a good recovery rates for detection of EC in white spirit
samples. Some issues should be clarified:
1. The caption of Fig.5 and Fig.S1 should be revised with more detailed information, such as the
substrate used for SERS measurements.
2. In the text “4.1. Substrates”, it is suggested to add some description on the assignments for UV-
vis spectra and Raman spectra of R6G.
3. SERS signal of R6G and EC on the surface of flower-shaped silver substrates was stronger for
that obtained from silver nanocubes. Would nanostructure size influence the SERS enhancement?
Since the size of flower-shaped silver nanostructure was 500 nm while the size of silver
nanocubes was only 50-60 nm. Wavelength selected for the measurement also play an important
role on the SERS performance.
4. In fig.4(b), the predominant bands in SERS spectra were quite different for flower-shaped silver
nanostructure and silver nanocubes substrates. Assignment of Raman bands obtained from EC
on silver nanocubes substrates should be added in Table S1.
5. There are a few confused expression, such as “white spirit”/“wine”, and “nonresonant probe
molecule”.

The manuscript “Detection of ethyl carbamate in wine using surface-enhanced Raman
spectroscopy” shows a very exciting, practical application of SERS; namely, the detection and
quantification of ethyl carbamate (EC), a carcinogenic substance formed during fermentation and
storage of alcoholic beverages, by using two SERS substrates with different morphologies.
I have the following observations regarding this study:
1. Although the authors mentioned a study in which silver capped gold nanoparticles were used
to detect EC, they don’t offer a justification for using flower/cube- shaped silver nanoparticles
instead of spherical nanoparticles that are easier to synthesize. The authors only mention that the
linear range of the SERS signal is extended when using flower-shaped silver nanoparticles,
compared to silver capped gold nanoparticles, in reference 1.
2. In the Introduction section the authors mention that they propose a simple and efficient
method for detecting and quantifying EC by SERS, however, the measuring protocol involves
drying the samples for 6 h, which is very inconvenient. In ref. 1 from the manuscript, the authors
have detected EC in liquid drop form, using colloidal solutions, which is much faster. This raises
again the question if conventional, spherical silver nanoparticles are not more suitable for this
study and what exactly is the advantage of using flower-shaped silver nanoparticles?
3. The authors don’t mention the variability of the SERS signal at the surface of the dried
nanostructures-EC mixture. The SERS signal most probably varies significantly, based on the
drying pattern of the mixture and the local concentration of the analyte. Thus, the analysis of the
variability of the SERS signal over the surface of the dried samples would be recommended.
4. In figure 4b, spectrum b is supposed to be the SERS spectra from EC using the cubed-shaped
nanoparticles, however, only the SERS bands of R6G can be clearly observed. This suggests a
contamination of the SERS substrate, so the authors are hardly recommended to redo this
measurement.
5. The quantification of EC is only tested on spiked samples, not also on real life samples (as
opposed to reference 1, where the authors used real-life samples). In addition to that, the
quantification analysis is poorly described. It is mentioned that the intensity of 857 cm-1 SERS
band was used. However, it is generally considered that the peak area is more precise for linear
regression analysis. Moreover, if using the intensity of a SERS band, the authors should mention
the kind of spectra processing that they applied since this has a major effect in the intensity of
SERS spectra (background subtraction or normalization).
I do not recommend the publication of this study, since it lacks on novelty. The study is almost
identical to the one found in reference 1, the only thing that is different is the used SERS
substrate. More importantly, the study and the results of the study are superficial and the authors
did not analyse more deeply the connection between certain parameters (for example the SERS
substrate and the SERS linear range) and failed to rigorously analyse and describe their
experimental set up and the reason for choosing it.
Not at least, recent SERS publications indicate that the substrate morphology is less important;
more important is to generate enough SERS active sites on the surface, please see N. Leopold et
al., Beilstein J. Nanotechnol., 2018, 9, 2236-2247, https://www.beilstein-

Authors’ Response to Reviewers
The authors wish to thank the Reviewers for the valuable comments aimed to improve the quality
of the paper and thank the Editors for processing our manuscript. We have examined and corrected the
manuscript carefully and thoroughly. Please review the following answers to the Reviewers’
comments. All the revisions in the manuscript have been marked red.
Response to Reviewer No. 1
Thanks very much for reviewer’s careful review and valuable comments. These comments are
very meaningful to improve the quality of our paper.
1.The caption of Fig.5 and Fig.S1 should be revised with more detailed information, such as the
substrate used for SERS measurements.
Explain: Thank you very much for the suggestion. As the reviewer pointed out, we added more
detailed information to the caption of Fig.5 and Fig.S2. Please refer to the last paragraph in section 4.2
in the manuscript and Fig.S2 in electronic supplementary material.
2. In the text “4.1. Substrates”, it is suggested to add some description on the assignments for
UV-vis spectra and Raman spectra of R6G.
Explain: Thank you very much for the suggestion. We added the assignments for Raman spectra of
R6G. Please refer to the second paragraph in section 4.1 in the manuscript and Table S1 in electronic
supplementary material.
3. SERS signal of R6G and EC on the surface of flower-shaped silver substrates was stronger for
that obtained from silver nanocubes. Would nanostructure size influence the SERS
enhancement? Since the size of flower-shaped silver nanostructure was 500 nm while the size of
silver nanocubes was only 50-60 nm. Wavelength selected for the measurement also play an
important role on the SERS performance.
Explain: Thank you very much for the suggestion. Two sources of "hot spots" from flower-like
nanosilver subatrates: (1) the nanogaps between the two neighbouring nanoparticles located on the
basement; (2) the nanogaps between the two protrusions on the surface of flower-like nanoparticles.
The size of the protrusions or nanoparticles might be about 50-60 nm. Therefore, the nanostructure
may play an important role in influencing the SERS enhancement. Compared to silver nanocubes,
flower-shaped silver substrates can provide more tremendous “ hot spots ” . The SERS spectra of
R6G and EC were tested under the conditions where the wavelength selected for the two substrates
was optimal respectively. For flower-shaped silver substrate, a 785 nm excitation wavelength was
optimum wavelength. For silver nanocubes, a 532 nm excitation wavelength was optimum
wavelength. Except the excitation wavelength, other experimental parameters were consistent. Please
refer to the last paragraph in section 3.4 in the manuscript.
4. In fig.4(b), the predominant bands in SERS spectra were quite different for flower-shaped
silver nanostructure and silver nanocubes substrates. Assignment of Raman bands obtained
from EC on silver nanocubes substrates should be added in Table S1.
Explain: Thank you very much for the suggestion. Assignment of Raman bands obtained from EC on
silver nanocubes substrates was added in a new Table. Please refer to Table S3.
5. There are a few confused expression, such as “white spirit”/“wine”, and “nonresonant
probe molecule”.
Explain: Thank you very much for the suggestion. We had changed the wine into liquors. Please refer
to the title. R6G can be used as a resonant Raman probe (524nm) or as a SERS probe. Since our
excitation wavelength is 785nm, R6G is a non-resonant state and is written as a non-resonant probe
molecule.
Response to Reviewer No. 2
Thanks very much for reviewer’s careful review and valuable comments. These comments are
very meaningful to improve the quality of our paper.
1. Although the authors mentioned a study in which silver capped gold nanoparticles were used
to detect EC, they don’t offer a justification for using flower/cube-shaped silver nanoparticles
instead of spherical nanoparticles that are easier to synthesize. The authors only mention that
the linear range of the SERS signal is extended when using flower-shaped silver nanoparticles,
compared to silver capped gold nanoparticles, in reference 1.
Explain: Thank you very much for the suggestion. Due to the abundant anisotropic protrusions,
flower-like silver substrates can provide more tremendous“hot spots”than a regular structure. Please
refer to the first paragraph in Page2 in the manuscript.
2. In the Introduction section the authors mention that they propose a simple and efficient
method for detecting and quantifying EC by SERS, however, the measuring protocol involves
drying the samples for 6 h, which is very inconvenient. In ref. 1 from the manuscript, the
authors have detected EC in liquid drop form, using colloidal solutions, which is much faster.
This raises again the question if conventional, spherical silver nanoparticles are not more
suitable for this study and what exactly is the advantage of using flower-shaped silver
nanoparticles?
Explain: Thank you very much for the suggestion. In comparison with colloidal nanoparticles, one
main advantage of solid substrates is that they allow much more flexibility. The main factor which
distinguishes colloidal particles from roughened or textured enhancing surfaces is the need to
aggregate the particles to obtain optimum enhancement. This aggregation introduces another variable
into the experimental procedure and undeniably complicates any assay. At the least it may add an
additional physical mixing step. More importantly, the aggregating agent may interact directly with
the enhancing surface which can lead to precipitation of the colloid rather than formation of
metastable aggregates. Such precipitation can result in a marked reduction in the enhanced signals
over a period of minutes. Typically, liquid samples are flowed over the enhancing surface while the
monitoring beam is directed onto a single point on the surface. Therefore, it is better to use solid
substrates for SERS measurement by drying the sample. Please refer to the last paragraph in section
3.2 in the manuscript.
3. The authors don’t mention the variability of the SERS signal at the surface of the dried
nanostructures-EC mixture. The SERS signal most probably varies significantly, based on the
drying pattern of the mixture and the local concentration of the analyte. Thus, the analysis of
the variability of the SERS signal over the surface of the dried samples would be recommended.
Explain: Thank you very much for the suggestion. We have added experiments to analyzing the
variability of the SERS signal over flower-shaped silver substrates which were adsorbed with R6G.
The RSD of intensity of bands at 611 and 1510 cm-1 were 8.16% and 7.74%, respectively, indicating
that flower-shaped silver substrates are highly uniform. Please refer to the first paragraph in section
4.2 in the manuscript.
4. In figure 4b, spectrum b is supposed to be the SERS spectra from EC using the cubed-shaped
nanoparticles, however, only the SERS bands of R6G can be clearly observed. This suggests a
contamination of the SERS substrate, so the authors are hardly recommended to redo this
measurement.
Explain: Thank you very much for the suggestion. According to the Fig. 4b, the EC SERS spectra
based on different nanostructure substrates were different. The characteristic bands of their assignment
were shown in Table S2 and Table S3. Please refer to the Table S2 and Table S3. in electronic
supplementary material. In addition, The SERS spectra of R6G adsorbed on cube-shaped silver
substrates have been measured again and the SERS bands of EC were identical to figure 4b in the
manuscript.
5. The quantification of EC is only tested on spiked samples, not also on real life samples (as
opposed to reference 1, where the authors used real-life samples). In addition to that, the
quantification analysis is poorly described. It is mentioned that the intensity of 857 cm-1 SERS
band was used. However, it is generally considered that the peak area is more precise for linear
regression analysis. Moreover, if using the intensity of a SERS band, the authors should mention
the kind of spectra processing that they applied since this has a major effect in the intensity of
SERS spectra (background subtraction or normalization).
Explain: Thank you very much for the suggestion. Our experiment used the real-life sample(white
spirit) to investigate the practicality of the developed method. Firstly, the SERS spectrum of the white
spirit based on flower-shaped silver substrates was tested to ensure that there was no EC in this white
spirit. Then, adding some Specified amount of EC into the white spirit, SERS spectra of these spiked
samples were tested based on flower-shaped silver substrates. According to the intensity of band at
857cm-1 , the calculated concentration value is obtained. By analyzing the results of error analysis
between actual values and calculated values of EC, it was found taht flower-shaped silver substrates
displayed a good recovery rates for detection of EC in white spirit samples. Please refer to the section
4.3 in the manuscript. In addition, spectra data was subtracted background by the Spectral acquisition
software for the instrument we used. Please refer to the fourth paragraph in section 3.3 in the
manuscript.

Sensitivity down to the nano-molar concentrations is standard however usually a higher

required sensitivity in g/liter and molar concentrations are required.
Explain: Thank you very much for the suggestion. The proposed method behaved good analytical
performance in quantitative detection of EC. The detection limit of EC aqueous solution was 10-9 M
(0.89 ×10-11 g/liter). Please refer to the part of conclusion in the manuscript.
Statistical analysis to reach quantitative levels of detection usually use image processing (R
Buividas et al, Journal of biophotonics 8 (7), 567-574 2015) and acquisition time should be

signal was detected, etc. This should be properly presented. If measurement is carried from
different location on concentrated (dried) sample, very different data can be obtained (see
example: G Seniutinas et al, Optics express 23 (5), 6763-6772 2015)
Explain: Thank you very much for the suggestion. Acquisition time had been shown in our
manuscript, please refer to part 3.4 SERS test. Flower-shaped silver substrates had been confirmed
that they are highly uniform, and the measurements were carried out randomly based on the surface of
flower-shaped silver substrates. Please refer to the first paragraph in section 4.2 in the manuscript.
One usually overlooked issue is that under SERS measurements chemical changes are taking
place (E Mitsai, et al Nanoscale 10 (20), 9780-9787 2018). since Ag is active metal, what
reference measurements were carried out to exclude generation of other compounds which
might obscure and intervene with measurements of the SERS bands of the searched analyte?
Explain: Thank you very much for the suggestion. Reference measurements about the probe molecule
R6G were carried out to exclude chemical changes under SERS measurements. Please refer to section
4.1 in the manuscript.
