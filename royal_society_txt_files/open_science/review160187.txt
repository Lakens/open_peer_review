Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
Overall, the manuscript would be of interest to the readers of Royal Society Open Science,
however as currently written the manuscript has several major issues and does not warrant
publication. Most importantly, the authors conclusions are largely speculative and are not drawn
from the experimental data. Rather, the authors appear to have taken a very narrow view on
what is taking place during the shift from anaerobic to aerobic conditions and have not
considered a number of well-known facets of E. coli metabolism that could be a factor in
explaining the experimental results. Major comments reflecting the above that require additional
content/experiments are listed below:
1. As stated, the authors based their investigation into PykF localization largely on the fact that
extracellular pyruvate increased while intracellular pyruvate remained largely unchanged.
However, the authors fail to address 2 well-known mechanisms in E. coli metabolism that could
explain these findings. The authors state that “A second possibility [for increased extracellular
pyruvate with no change to intracellular pyruvate], that pyruvate was converted rapidly to some
other metabolite, was considered unlikely because no such metabolites were seen by NMR”.
However, acetate represents a potential metabolite directly produced from pyruvate through the
action of pyruvate oxidase, a peripheral membrane enzyme that has been shown to be involved
in overflow metabolism and is responsible for a significant amount of pyruvate metabolism
under aerobic conditions. Given the stationary levels of acetate (both intra- and extra-cellular)
while other fermentation products decrease during the same time frame, acetate could easily
explain the lack of increase in intracellular pyruvate. Furthermore, the authors state that “If
pyruvate is secreted without appearing in the cytoplasm, the enzyme(s) that produce it must
relocate from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane” (Line 231-232), however they do not mention
or discuss the fact that glucose is concomitantly transported and phosphorylated by the PEP-
dependent phosphotransferase system (an inner membrane system), directly resulting in
pyruvate synthesis. As such, a potential enzyme producing pyruvate is already located in the cell
membrane and could explain pyruvate secretion without enzyme relocation (e.g. increased
glucose transport through the PTS system without the same transient increase in pyruvate
metabolism). The above is not meant to discount their finding on potential PykF relocation, rather
that the authors need to either take a boarder view on potential enzyme relocation (e.g. test
additional enzymes for relocation, such as PykA to start) or justify beyond a doubt (with
additional experimental evidence) why only PykF was selected for further study.
2. Relating to the above, the authors analysis to the reasons for increasing extracellular pyruvate
is largely based on overflow metabolism relating to the rapid inactivation of PFL by oxygen.
However, the authors also state (line 181) that the levels of acetate reflect that cells that are still
under anaerobic conditions, even 2 hours after the addition of oxygen and PFL has been shown to
be active even under microaerobic conditions (Sawers RG, Clark DP. 2004. Fermentative pyruvate
and acetyl-coenzyme A metabolism in Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and molecular
biology). Clarification is needed here as the authors cannot state the cells are under anaerobic
conditions and claim rapid oxygen-inactivation of PFL as soon as oxygen is put into the system
on the other hand. Given that this is again a major basis for their conclusions there is no room for
ambiguity here.

3. Can the authors explain the rather large intracellular lactate concentration (~8 mM) compared
to minimal extracellular concentration? Lactate represents another potential outlet for pyruvate
metabolism and the authors provide no explanation of the above or the fact that intracellular
lactate remains unchanged compared to other fermentative products (e.g. succinate).
4. Given the fact that one method for resolving PykF relocation was not sufficient, the authors
need to provide additional details on FLAG tag labelling of PykF. No details are given on the
applicability of this approach for tracking enzyme location in the context they are using the
method. The authors need to provide justification of using this approach in the form of other
literature reports and/or further description/discussion of why their selection of this method
was appropriate here. Furthermore, the number of counted particles varies greatly between time
points (>50% in some cases). Is this a reflection of the method itself (e.g. incomplete labeling or
microscopy techniques) or does this indicate a change in the overall number of FLAG-tagged
enzymes (e.g. transient changes in enzyme levels)? Either could have major implications for
drawing conclusions from the results and should be addressed.
5. The discussion on complete glycolytic pathway enzymes relocation to the membrane does not
follow from experimental data, as evidence to one enzymes potential relocation does not provide
evidence to an entire pathway relocating, especially considering the above points. The authors
must provide additional experimental evidence (e.g. relocation of other enzymes) or clearly
discuss literature evidence pointing to this for prokaryotic organisms for this to warrant
inclusion. As currently presented, the experimental evidence only allows the authors to conclude
that 1 enzyme appears to relocate in response to the tested shift in conditions.

The manuscript of Yasid et al describes a chemostat study of metabolite analysis of E coli during
the transition from anaerobic growth to aerobic growth. The work makes a contribution to the
literature as it describes a new method of quenching samples for metabolomics. Interestingly, the
authors report the phenomenon of pyruvate secretion by the organism during this transition and
show that one of the paralogous pyruvate kinases in E coli associates with the membrane during
4
transition and it is hypothesised that this facilitates the rapid excretion of pyruvate in to the
medium.
The work is well conducted and convincing and makes an interesting contribution to the
literature.
I think the authors have addressed the reviewers comments and the work is suitable for
publication as it is.
One minor comment is that the Authors could make more of the novel method and state how this
may be useful for a range of unicellular bacteria.

Reviewer 1
1. There are several points here that require answering. The question under discussion is
whether the pyruvate produced by glycolysis could be diverted into other metabolites, and
whether this can provide an explanation for the absence of any rise in intracellular pyruvate.
A quantitative analysis of metabolite flux (lines 174-183) shows that the amount of
extracellular pyruvate observed is identical (within error) to the amount of intracellular
pyruvate that is expected to be produced by glycolysis over the first 30 minutes after
aeration. Therefore if a substantial fraction of pyruvate were converted to other metabolites,
the rise in extracellular pyruvate cannot be explained: the only reasonable explanation for
the appearance of the extracellular pyruvate is that this corresponds to the missing
intracellular pyruvate. This point has now been added (line 181), and means that significant
metabolism of pyruvate immediately after the transition would be a problem rather than a
solution. (a) Acetate represents a potential metabolite directly produced from pyruvate
through the action of pyruvate oxidase, a peripheral membrane enzyme that has been shown
to be involved in overflow metabolism and is responsible for a significant amount of pyruvate
metabolism under aerobic conditions. Given the stationary levels of acetate (both intra- and
extra-cellular) while other fermentation products decrease during the same time frame,
acetate could easily explain the lack of increase in intracellular pyruvate. We agree that
pyruvate oxidase could provide an explanation for the lack of a decrease in acetate, and
have now added text to this effect (line 160). However, we note that the observed stationary
intracellular concentrations of acetate (ie the lack of the expected 20%/hr decrease from 37
mM to 30 mM over the first hour) are not compatible with the large increase expected (at
least 100 mM/hr, line 216) if it is being converted from pyruvate. Further, some rise in
acetate is to be expected due to breakdown of acetyl CoA produced by the newly induced
PDHC: see new text added (lines 155-160). In summary, lack of a decrease in acetate is
explicable based on mechanisms such as those suggested by the reviewer, but this cannot
explain lack of a large increase, or (more fundamentally) the large increase in extracellular
pyruvate, which exactly matches the missing intracellular pyruvate. (b) A potential enzyme
producing pyruvate is already located in the cell membrane and could explain pyruvate
secretion without enzyme relocation (e.g. increased glucose transport through the PTS
system without the same transient increase in pyruvate metabolism). The PTS system
operates both before and after the introduction of air, and the C balances are consistent
with this membrane-proximal pyruvate entering fermentative metabolism before
perturbation. Therefore, the fate of pyruvate during the acute phase of the transition to
aerobic respiration must differ from the anaerobic steady state implying that there is some
adaptation at the membrane to permit pyruvate excretion. This point has been added (lines
221-231). It is also worth noting that the PTS system is not implicated in transporting
pyruvate across membranes, and always works in the direction of increasing intracellular
pyruvate, not decreasing it.
These arguments provide a detailed justification of our contention that extracellular
pyruvate produced by continued glycolysis is being secreted directly without entering an
intracellular pool. It does not justify our specific focus on PykF (the last point raised by the
reviewer). The reviewer’s point here is well made and is addressed below.
2. The authors’ analysis to the reasons for increasing extracellular pyruvate is largely based on
overflow metabolism relating to the rapid inactivation of PFL by oxygen. However, the
authors also state (line 181) that the levels of acetate reflect that cells are still under
anaerobic conditions. .. Clarification is needed here as the authors cannot state the cells are
under anaerobic conditions and claim rapid oxygen-inactivation of PFL as soon as oxygen is
put into the system on the other hand. Given that this is again a major basis for their
conclusions there is no room for ambiguity here. The best evidence for inactivation of PFL is
the immediate shutdown of formate production, both intracellular and extracellular, now
highlighted in lines 152-155. Arguments based on acetate concentrations are rendered
difficult because of the possible production of acetate from other metabolic routes, as
discussed above (lines 155-161). We have accordingly removed discussion of the acetate
aerobiosis scale, except as it affects the NADH/NAD+ ratio (line 173). It is clear that cells do
not instantly become aerobic on aeration of the cell suspension, but it is also clear that cells
are sufficiently aerobic to inactivate PFL immediately.
3. Can the authors explain the rather large intracellular lactate concentration (~8 mM)
compared to minimal extracellular concentration? Lactate represents another potential
outlet for pyruvate metabolism and the authors provide no explanation of the above. Lactate
is an overmetabolite, secreted in anaerobic growth. Active cells normally maintain a high
ratio of intracellular lactate concentration to extracellular concentration: one estimate for E.
coli puts the ratio as at least 20-fold (Núñez et al Biochem Biophys Res Comm 2002 290:824),
while the corresponding ratio for pyruvate is around 100 (Lang et al J. Bact 1987 169:380).
Therefore a measured ratio here of about 80 (0.1 : 8) does not seem unreasonable. It is
certainly true that lactate is a potential outlet for pyruvate metabolism. As argued above,
the amounts of lactate are nowhere near large enough to account for the pyruvate
metabolism, and because the rate of pyruvate secretion is (within error) identical to the rate
of production of pyruvate by glycolysis, there is no need to look for metabolic routes for
breakdown of pyruvate. However, the similar time dependence for lactate and pyruvate,
both intracellular and extracellular, does suggest that there may be some metabolic
relationship. We have accordingly added some text to point this out (lines 205-211).
4. The authors need to provide additional details on FLAG tag labelling of PykF. No details are
given on the applicability of this approach for tracking enzyme location in the context they
are using the method. The authors need to provide justification of using this approach in the
form of other literature reports and/or further description/discussion of why their selection of
this method was appropriate here. Furthermore, the number of counted particles varies
greatly between time points (>50% in some cases). Is this a reflection of the method itself
(e.g. incomplete labeling or microscopy techniques) or does this indicate a change in the
overall number of FLAG-tagged enzymes (e.g. transient changes in enzyme levels)? We are
not clear what additional details are being asked for, since the experimental details are fairly
extensive, and also fairly standard (with the exception of the chromosomal replacement,
which again is extensively described, in Supplementary Material). There have been many
reports of FLAG tagging having been used with bacterial proteins, but in most cases the tags
have been used for pull-downs or Western blotting rather than localisation. There are rather
few reports of FLAG tagging being used to localise proteins within bacteria, and we thank
the referee for pointing this out. We have therefore added a short section in the paper
noting this (lines 319-322), providing some citations (lines 281-285), and justifying the use of
FLAG tagging with nanogold-conjugated antibodies (lines 285-287). In the paper we have
noted that cell morphology is constant, as are pykF transcript level and PykF-GFP
concentration (lines 299-302). We are therefore confident that there is no change in the
overall number of FLAG-tagged enzymes. The variation in number of counted particles is
largely a reflection on the number of images counted, and the number of particles in each.
The main aim was to get enough particles to give reliable counting statistics: the exact
number of particles is immaterial because we are considering the relative numbers of
particles in each location. When analysing microscope images, there is always a temptation
to pick the feature one is looking for. Here we minimised any such bias by counting blind, as
described (lines 459-462).
5. The discussion on complete glycolytic pathway enzymes relocation to the membrane does
not follow from experimental data, as evidence to one enzymes potential relocation does not
provide evidence to an entire pathway relocating, especially considering the above points.
The authors must provide additional experimental evidence (e.g. relocation of other
enzymes) or clearly discuss literature evidence pointing to this for prokaryotic organisms for
this to warrant inclusion. As currently presented, the experimental evidence only allows the
authors to conclude that 1 enzyme appears to relocate in response to the tested shift in
conditions. The reviewer is quite correct that we have only demonstrated membrane
localisation for a single enzyme. Work required to show this for more enzymes is under way
but is time-consuming and far from trivial (lines 383-384). The paper already presents some
discussion of clusters of both prokaryotic enzymes forming transiently, and both prokaryotic
and eukaryotic glycolytic enzymes forming transiently (which is an important direction for
future research), but we fully accept the reviewer’s point and have therefore removed
claims that more than one enzyme may be relocating (lines 366ff).

We thank the reviewer for their comments, which we have responded to (lines 331-332).
