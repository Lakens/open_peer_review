The author constructed hierarchically porous aerogels welded by solvent-vapor, which is an
interesting work and has never been reported. This article falls within the scape of Royal Society
Open Science. However, there are some issues need to be addressed.
1. Whether the solver vapor can permeate into PI aerogel? Please indicate the relative SEM
images.
2. The plastic deformation after 100 compressive cycles should be provided rather than only
recovery ratio. In addition, the compressive performance need to be improved further to be
comparable with the available aerogels obtained by thermo-crosslinking.
3. The filtration efficiency in Fig. 9 should be presented in the form of line chart.
4. The spell and grammar should be improved further

In this paper the authors demonstrate a simple route to polyimide aerogels by freeze drying and
subsequent treatment with DCM which allows for the crosslinking of the fibres.
The characterisation and morphology of the structures is thorough demonstrating the change in
morphology from single fibres to crosslinked fibres using SEM.
The authors then go on to describe the mechanical properties and finally the filtration properties
of the aerogels demonstrating good performance and relatively low drops in pressure.

4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal

Appendix A
Dear editor and reviewers:
Thank you for your letter accepting the manuscript entitled “Robust Polyimide
Nano/Microfiber Aerogels Welded by Solvent-Vapor for Environmental
Applications” pending revision. We have revised the manuscript seriously according
to the comments and suggestions. We have also attended to the formatting and
language of the manuscript according to your suggestions. The revisions and
explanations are listed as the follows. The modifications were marked in red in the
revised manuscript.
Response to comments by Referee #1
1. Whether the solver vapor can permeate into PI aerogel? Please indicate the relative
SEM images.
v Thanks for your comments.
It could be verified that the solvent vapor could permeate in the PI aerogels. As shown
in Fig 4a and b (in the original manuscript), the SEM images illustrated the internal
looking of the aerogels. It could be seen that the adjacent fibers were closely bonded
at the cross points after DCM vapor treatment. In addition, supplementation of this
conclusion was carried out by relative SEM images which were shown in following
Fig. S1.
Fig.S1 SEM images showing the PI aerogel treatment by the DCM vapor: (a) surface
SEM image and (b) internal SEM image.
2. The plastic deformation after 100 compressive cycles should be provided rather
than only recovery ratio. In addition, the compressive performance need to be
improved further to be comparable with the available aerogels obtained by
thermo-crosslinking.
v Thank you for your advice.
Cyclic compression tests with 100 loading-unloading fatigue cycles at a large strain of
80% were further conducted to study the plastic deformation of PI aerogels (Fig.7f,
marked in red in our revised manuscript). As shown in the following image (Fig. S2a
and b), there is nearly no deformation could be detected after 100 loading-unloading
fatigue cycles, corresponding to the compression curve. According to the data of the
100th cycle, the recovery ratio was as high as 99.89%. It was indicated that the PI
aerogel possessed great compressive resilient performance.
When the uncross-linked PI aerogel was processed by heating 160 oC for 1h, serious
shrinkage occurred on the aerogels (Fig. S2c). The structure and appearance of
aerogel were badly destroyed. However, lower temperature could not provide
effective bonding between fibers. That is the reason why we choose vapor treatment
to weld the aerogels.

PI aerogel recovered after 100 cycles compressive fatigue test; (c) Photographs of PI
aerogels welded by heating at 120 oC/160 oC for 1h.
3. The filtration efficiency in Fig. 9 should be presented in the form of line chart.
v Thank you for your advice.
Fig.9 was modified into line chart in the revised manuscript.
4. The spell and grammar should be improved further
v Thanks for your revise.
We have double checked the manuscript and corrected some minor mistakes, marked
in red in the article.
