In this paper, the authors developed a general methodology based on empirical model
decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert transform (HT) to detect unusual dynamical features, or
dynamical anomalies from big data sets. This is an important problem at the present, for the
following reasons: (1) analysis of big data sets is a frontier and interdisciplinary problem in
science and engineering, and (2) "abnormal" or unusual behaviors/features in nonlinear and
complex systems are often of fundamental and unique importance to understanding the intrinsic
dynamics, providing a window to probe into the system for prediction and even control. The
combination of EMD and HT has advantages over the traditional Fourier or wavelet transform
based methods. In particular, the proposed EMD based method can fully characterize random
signals, such as EEG signals, which are time varying in both frequency and amplitude. For such
signals, the traditional Fourier analysis is quite limited because they are designed for linear and
stationary systems. Although windowed Fourier analysis or wavelet transform may be feasible to
generate patterns in the two-dimensional frequency-time plane pertinent to characteristic events,
two-dimensional feature identification in general is a difficult task. In this regard, the features
generated by the EMD methodology are one-dimensional, which are easier to be identified
computationally. In fact, the Hilbert transform and instantaneous frequency-based analysis have
proven to be especially suited for data from complex, nonlinear, and non-stationary dynamical
systems.
Utilizing extremely massive EEG data sets recorded from a number of rats over an extended
period of time as a case study, the authors successfully tested the key principles of their
methodology: preprocessing of massive data sets to eliminate erroneous data segments,
application of the empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert transform paradigm to obtain the
fundamental components embedded in the time series at distinct time scales, and
statistical/scaling analysis of the components. They demonstrated that a fundamental feature
associated epilepsy, high frequency oscillations (HFOs), can be reliably detected. More
surprisingly, they found that HFOs exhibit on-off intermittency that can be quantified by an
algebraic scaling law. This is of significant scientific value because pathologic HFOs reveal hyper-
synchronization within small discrete neuronal clusters responsible for seizure generation, and a
good understanding and accurate detection of HFOs may bring the grand goal of early seizure
prediction one step closer to reality and would also improve the localization of the seizure onset
zone to facilitate decision making with regard to surgical treatment.
Overall, the manuscript has three main contributions. Firstly, it illustrates how massive
biomedical data sets should be handled and processed, thus contributing to the frontier,
interdisciplinary field of big data analysis. Secondly, it demonstrates that the EMD and Hilbert
transform methodology can be effective for reliably detecting dynamical anomalies in nonlinear
and complex systems (e.g., high frequency oscillations associated with epilepsy in brain). Thirdly,
in terms of basic science, it reports a finding that can be of value to epilepsy: high frequency
oscillations exhibit on-off intermittency governed by a general scaling law. The paper is thus
potentially capable of generating a great deal of interest in big data analysis and biomedical
science. In addition, the paper is very well written. I recommend publication in SREP in its
present form.

This work proposes a framework of automatic detecting HFOs in the EEG data recorded from the
animal models of epilepsy. Excitingly, this framework is able to deal with big data, including a
compact procedure: data preprocessing, EMD analysis, and automatic detection and classification
of HFOs and population spikes. More interestingly, this work finds that HFOs take place in an
on-off intermittent manner with algebraic scaling. Also this work provides very good
discussions on the possible extension of the current work to the cases of more accurate detection
and realistic applications in early warning and intervene of epilepsy. I therefore conclude that
this work can be almost acceptable. Only a few concerns listed below need to be addressed
before the final acceptance.
(1) The number of the animal models is five. However, the result on the algebraic scaling seems
to be concluded from data of the only one animal model. Am I right? If so, the authors are
suggested to provide more evidences of statistical significance for this scaling by using data from
all the animal models.
(2) It seems that the developed framework has a great potential of dealing with the other big data,
such as the ECG data of the atrial fibrillation. It would be nice that the authors could describe the
application of the current framework in the other fields of big data. Also, there are a lot of
parameters, such as the window length and moving forward step-size, that needs to be
deliberately set in applications. It would be also nice that the authors could provide some
explanations and suggestions on the setting up of the key parameters with particular datasets.
(3) There are some typos that need to be amended, e.g. “local filed potentials” should be
corrected as “local field potentials”

Good work, I have some concerns:
1. The wording of this paper is very ambitious. For example, the use of "framework" is not
appropriate, and the use of 'Big data' is not appropriate either.
- Authors need to refer to HFO and EMD as a proposed algorithm, not a framework. If the
authors applied their algorithm to multiple datasets with different types of subjects, then the use
of the word framework would make sense.
- Authors can write "toward big data" or "promising results for big data analysis", the use of 7
hour recordings does not justify the "big data".
2. In my opinion, this study doesn't add any knowledge to the scientific community unless the
others compare and cite the following algorithms, which are identical to their proposed
algoirthm.

sponse. We have added a new figure (Fig. 10 in the revised manuscript) and an explanation
additional evidence to support the algebraic scaling law. The explanation appears as a new
ragraph immediately preceding the Discussion section, which reads
• We find that the algebraic scaling law for the on intervals of HFOs holds for all the animal
models. Figures 10(a-f) show more examples for a different rat. In particular, the scaling
was calculated for a specific channel for the pre-stimulation state, post-stimulation state,
evolution towards seizure, the status epilepticus phase, the epilepsy latent period, and the
spontaneous/recurrent seizure period, for panels (a-f), respectively. We see that, while the
details of the scaling behaviors can be different for the distinct critical phases (e.g., during
epileptogenesis the on-intervals with longer durations are dominant after the first seizure),
the algebraic nature of the scaling law is robust.
mment 2. “It seems that the developed framework has a great potential of dealing with the
er big data, such as the ECG data of the atrial fibrillation. It would be nice that the authors
uld describe the application of the current framework in the other fields of big data. Also,
re are a lot of parameters, such as the window length and moving forward step-size, that needs

planations and suggestions on the setting up of the key parameters with particular datasets.”
sponse. Regarding application of our framework to other fields of big data, we have added
following paragraph in Discussion (on page 9):
• Big data sets arise not only in biomedicine, but also in other fields of science and engineer-
ing. For example, in civil engineering, large sensor arrays are often employed to monitor
the temperature, humidity, and energy flows in large, complex infrastructure systems in a
continuous-time fashion. In such an application the underlying system is in general nonsta-
tionary and nonlinear, and to detect behaviors that deviate from the norm or the expected
is of considerable interest. Another example is earthquake data. A previous work [51] in-
dicated that seizures can be regarded as “quakes of the brain.” It is then conceivable that
the idea, method, and algorithms developed in this paper can be extended to big seismic
database for detecting anomalous oscillating signals (similar to HFOs) preceding the ac-
tual occurrence of earthquakes. In general, the EMD/Hilbert transform based methodology
demonstrated in this paper has broad applications because it is specifically designed [23] to
deal with nonlinear and nonstationary systems. Due to its built-in ability to obtain from
a complex, seemingly random time series a number of dominant components of distinct
time scales, the method is anticipated to be especially effective for anomaly detection. A
challenge is to develop mathematically justified, computationally reasonable and automated
procedures to detect anomalies from big data sets, which has been addressed in this paper
through the detection of HFOs from massive EEG data with multiple animal models.
The referee is insightful that the key parameters are those associated with the application of
EMD procedure, especially the window length and the moving forward step size. We have
ded the following explanation (on page 6):
• Small values of w and <U+2206>w result in rapidly oscillating amplitude functions, whereas too
large values of w and <U+2206>w would cause a loss of information. Empirically, the window size
can be chosen to include several IMF periods, e.g., six to nine, where the moving forward
step size <U+2206>w can be set as one.
mment 3. “There are some typos that need to be amended, e.g. ‘local filed potentials’ should
corrected as ‘local field potentials’.”
sponse. We thank the referee and have checked the manuscript carefully to correct typos.
eferee 3
e referee stated “Good work, I have some concerns.” His/her two comments have been ad-
ssed, as follows.
mment 1. “The wording of this paper is very ambitious. For example, the use of ’framework’
not appropriate, and the use of ’Big data’ is not appropriate either.
- Authors need to refer to HFO and EMD as a proposed algorithm, not a framework. If the
thors applied their algorithm to multiple datasets with different types of subjects, then the use
the word framework would make sense.
- Authors can write ”toward big data” or ”promising results for big data analysis”, the use of
our recordings does not justify the ‘big data’.”
sponse. The data involved in our work were multiple channel (32-64) recordings from five
imal models over a period of 4-6 weeks at the sampling frequency of 12KHz. For each animal
del (rat), the data amount is about 5TB. This is a typical “big data” case.
In fact, Referee 2 recognized that our work has the potential to extend to big data sets from
er fields. We have provided a discussion about the possible extension (on page 9, see also our
ponse to Comment 2 of Referee 2).
mment 2. “In my opinion, this study doesn’t add any knowledge to the scientific community
less the others compare and cite the following algorithms, which are identical to their proposed
oirthm.” The referee listed 7 papers and asked us to cite and to compare our work with them.
sponse. We have cited these papers (Refs. [50-56] in the revised manuscript) with the fol-
ing detailed discussion (on page 3):
• There were existing works on applying the EMD/Hilbert transform method to neural sys-
tems. Earlier the method was applied to analyzing biological signals and performing curve
fitting [50], and a combination of EMD, Hilbert transform, and smoothed nonlinear energy
operator was proposed to detect spikes hidden in human EEG data [51]. Subsequently, it
was demonstrated [52] that the methodology can be used to analyze neuronal oscillations in
the hippocampus of epileptic rats in vivo with the result that the oscillations are character-
istically different during the pre-ictal, seizure onset and ictal periods of the epileptic EEG
in different frequency bands. In another work [53], the EMD/Hilbert transform method was
applied to detecting synchrony episodes in both time and frequency domains. The method
was demonstrated to be useful for decomposing neuronal population oscillations to gain in-
sights into epileptic seizures [54], and EMD was used for extracting single-trial cortical beta
oscillatory activities in EEG signals [55]. The outputs of EMD, i.e., the IMFs, were demon-
strated to be useful for EEG signal classification [56]. Our work differs from these previous
works in that we address the issue of detecting HFOs and uncovering the underlying scaling
law.
