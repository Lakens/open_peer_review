This is an important paper that should be published. It is significant because (a) we still know
very little about the mechanisms of historical plague transmission, and (b) it is rare we have such
detailed documentary information on the dynamics of the spread and transmission process - i.e.
something tangible to support abstract modelling.
Some minor adaptations:
1. Bottom p.3/top p. 4. Make clear that better understanding of epidemiological characteristics in
the 3rd pandemic does not mean that these characteristics can be simply assumed to be
applicable to the 2nd Pandemic. That would have to be demonstrated.
2. Next paragraph down - no evidence for rat epizootics. This is surprising to me. I want to know
how unusual this is? How frequently were rat epizootics found in other late 19th- and early 20th
century plagues? Basically - is Glasgow a 'special case' or representative of many other Third
Pandemic cases.
3. Top of p. 12 - rather than 'historical plague outbreaks' I would explicitly note that these studies
find clustering in 2nd pandemic outbreaks from the 14th to the 18th century. on that note - is
there really no evidence of household clustering for 3rd pandemics elsewhere? that surprises me.
4. I would like a broader conclusion that notes that you are not dismissing the importance of the
rat as a general feature of plague transmission during the 3rd pandemic, but simply suggesting
here that the rat-flea-human model is not applicable for every outbreak, and other transmission
models (for the bubonic version) can apply in different historical contexts.
Other outstanding problems were already suggested by the previous referees, and well
addressed by the authors.

This paper provides a very interesting analysis of a small scale outbreak of plague during the 3rd
pandemic in the city of Glasgow. The use of historical data to explore the likelihood of human-to-
human plague transmission (through a human ectoparasite vector) and the household clustering
of plague cases, make this study sufficiently original and novel for publications in "Open
Science". Especially since the epidemiology of plague (both 2nd and 3rd pandemic) in Europe
remain poorly understood as the authors rightfully indicate.
Since two previous referees have already commented on the analysis of the data and the
conclusions derived from this analysis. And since I deem the responses of the authors on the
comments made by the previous referees to be sufficiently satisfying, I will instead focus on the
contextualization of the paper within the broader historiography of historical plague studies.
Afterwards, I will also include some minor comments that the authors can choose to implement
or ignore at their own discretion, as I do not think them vital enough to prevent publication of the
paper.
Contextualization
At several points in the paper, the authors indicate that their findings "provide important insights
into the epidemiology of bubonic plague outbreaks in pre-antibiotic Europe". Although I agree
that the paper provides important insights, I would ask that the authors to reflect more critically
on the representativeness of findings for the 3rd pandemic as indicative for all bubonic plague
outbreaks in "pre-antibiotic Europe". Just as we cannot assume that pre-industrial
epidemiological experiences necessarily mirror modern ones, findings for 19th century plague
outbreaks might not be so easily transposed to late medieval and early modern plague outbreaks.
This may, at first, seem like a trivial point, but the disparsities between the 2nd- and 3rd plague
epidemics have lead some historical plague experts, such as Samuel Cohn, to claim that , "the
Black Death in Europe, 1347-52, and its successive waves to the eighteenth century was any
disease other than the rat-based bubonic plague, whose bacillus was discovered in 1894". Even
though Cohn wrote these words before laboratory testing could conclusively prove that plague
was the causative agent of the 2nd pandemic, the underlying factors that led to his provacative
statement remain. Plagues of the 2nd and 3rd pandemic differed noticeably in several key
epidemiological characteristics, on the issue of severity alone the present paper illustrates that
very fact.
Minor comments (non-compulsory)
To gain further insight in the historical data and provide more information, I would ask the
authors to take into account the following elements.
1. What was the geographical occurrence of plague within the city of Glasgow? Were cases
clustered in one specific section of the city? Or were they spread out over various parts?
2. What was the total population of Glasgow in 1900. This will help understand how small a
percentage of inhabitants died from plague during this outbreak (again see differences between
2nd and 3rd pandemics).

3. Page 3. For literature reference 1, an additional publication might be the book by Myron
Echenberg "Plague ports: The global urban impact of bubonic plague, 1894-1901". This study also
refers to the 1900 and 1901 plague outbreaks in Glasgow. Alternatively ther is also the article by
Echenberg: Pestis Redux, in the journal of World History, which provides some historical
background information on the 1900 Glasgow outbreak.
4. Page 3. The sentence "In general, the epidemiology of plague outbreaks in Europe is poorly
understood", can be linked (for the 2nd pandemic) to a recent article by Guido Alfani and Tommy
Murphy (2017) "Plague and lethal epidemics in the pre-industrial world" p. 318.
5. Page 5. The authors mention several counter-measures implemented by the authorities to
mitigate the impact of plague in Glasgow. Some of these 1, 2 and 4 were also widely used in the
late medieval and early modern period. Given the limited number of plague cases, would the
authors be willing to formulate a hypothesis regarding the effectiveness of the remaining
counter-measures as decisive for the limited spread of plague?
6. Page 9. The authors mention that 60% of patients were female and that the overall case-fatality
rate was 42.8%. What percentage of overall deaths were female? This also links up with page 11.
In describing the epidemiological characteristics of the Glasgow outbreak, the authors reflect on
several factors (case fatality rate, symptomatic period), despite the limited sample-size. Would
the authors also be willing to describe female over-mortality (if this is the case) and link it up to
contemporary findings of female mortality being skewed towards women in certain African cases
(e.g. Tanzania)?

Some minor adaptations:
1. Bottom p.3/top p. 4. Make clear that better understanding of epidemiological
characteristics in the 3rd pandemic does not mean that these characteristics can be simply
assumed to be applicable to the 2nd Pandemic. That would have to be demonstrated.
We have changed this sentence to:
“Therefore, there is an opportunity to better understand the epidemiology of plague
outbreaks in Europe during the Third Pandemic. Although these outbreaks cannot simply
be assumed to be representative of the Second Pandemic, they can provide a valuable
point of comparison for future studies.”
2. Next paragraph down - no evidence for rat epizootics. This is surprising to me. I want to
know how unusual this is? How frequently were rat epizootics found in other late 19th- and
early 20th century plagues? Basically - is Glasgow a 'special case' or representative of many
other Third Pandemic cases.
As far as we know, the frequency of rat epizootics during this time period for other
outbreaks in Europe or other parts of the world has not been the focus of a study yet,
which would be a large study on its own. So, it is hard to answer how unusual the Glasgow
situation was. However, we have included the numbers of plague-infected rats caught in
Glasgow. This data indicates that plague-infected rats were found in later years, although
not in large numbers.
3. Top of p. 12 - rather than 'historical plague outbreaks' I would explicitly note that these
studies find clustering in 2nd pandemic outbreaks from the 14th to the 18th century. on that
note - is there really no evidence of household clustering for 3rd pandemics elsewhere? that
surprises me.
We have changed this sentence to:
“Many studies have reported household clustering of cases during Second Pandemic plague
outbreaks in Europe [20-25].”
With regards to the Third Pandemic, we are not aware of any other studies that have
reported an increased rate of household transmission of plague in Europe for this time
period. We believe that there are very few outbreaks in Europe during the Third Pandemic
that are large enough to be used in a quantitative analysis for this purpose. Moreover,
without case information on the type of plague it can be difficult to know whether the
cluster is bubonic cases or pneumonic cases or both. We do note that an outbreak in Nepal
reports clustering of bubonic cases, while outbreaks in Bombay, Sydney, and New Orleans
do not.
4. I would like a broader conclusion that notes that you are not dismissing the importance of
the rat as a general feature of plague transmission during the 3rd pandemic, but simply
suggesting here that the rat-flea-human model is not applicable for every outbreak, and
other transmission models (for the bubonic version) can apply in different historical
contexts.
We have changed the concluding paragraph to:
“In conclusion, our study describes an outbreak of bubonic plague in Glasgow in 1900 and
uses transmission tree reconstruction to better understand the epidemiological
characteristics of the outbreak. Based on the clustering of cases, bubonic plague most likely
spread from human-to-human, possibly though a human ectoparasite vector. Without
diminishing the role of rats in plague transmission during the Third Pandemic, it is
important to consider that other models of transmission may apply in different historical
contexts. In a modern context, the information in this study can be used to model plague
outbreaks where the asymptomatic and symptomatic periods for untreated bubonic cases
may be relevant.”

We understand the point raised here, and we have been more specific in our wording
throughout the paper to make it clearer that the outbreak only represents itself and is not
representative of other outbreaks in Europe. We instead say now that it provides a point of
comparison for future studies.
Minor comments (non-compulsory)
To gain further insight in the historical data and provide more information, I would ask the
authors to take into account the following elements.
1. What was the geographical occurrence of plague within the city of Glasgow? Were cases
clustered in one specific section of the city? Or were they spread out over various parts?
We have added the sentence:
“By March 1901, the city had a population of 761,712, but the cases were primarily
located in the densely-populated Gorbals area, on the south bank of the river Clyde
[10].”
2. What was the total population of Glasgow in 1900. This will help understand how small a
percentage of inhabitants died from plague during this outbreak (again see differences
between 2nd and 3rd pandemics).

Tommy Murphy (2017) "Plague and lethal epidemics in the pre-industrial world" p. 318.
We have added the citation for Alfani and Murphy.
5. Page 5. The authors mention several counter-measures implemented by the authorities to
mitigate the impact of plague in Glasgow. Some of these 1, 2 and 4 were also widely used in
the late medieval and early modern period. Given the limited number of plague cases, would
the authors be willing to formulate a hypothesis regarding the effectiveness of the remaining
counter-measures as decisive for the limited spread of plague?
It is difficult to say which countermeasures were effective in stopping the outbreak,
especially given that several were enacted and at least some (in theory) would have
reduced contact events, and thus transmission. Although we think the reviewer raises an
interesting point here, we hesitate to comment on it further because our aim is not to
compare aspects of the Second and Third Pandemics in this paper, only to describe an
outbreak and the disease in untreated bubonic plague cases.
6. Page 9. The authors mention that 60% of patients were female and that the overall case-
fatality rate was 42.8%. What percentage of overall deaths were female? This also links up
with page 11. In describing the epidemiological characteristics of the Glasgow outbreak, the
authors reflect on several factors (case fatality rate, symptomatic period), despite the limited
sample-size. Would the authors also be willing to describe female over-mortality (if this is the
case) and link it up to contemporary findings of female mortality being skewed towards
women in certain African cases (e.g. Tanzania)?
We have looked into this and changed the sentence in the paper to be more specific. Our
data shows that 9/21 (42.8%) infected females died and 6/14 (42.8%) males died. Rather
unsurprisingly, a ‘test of proportions’ shows that there is no difference in these rates (p =1)
and thus no support for female over-mortality for this outbreak.
