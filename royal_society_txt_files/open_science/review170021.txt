Review of Royal Society Open Source manuscript RSOS-170021 “The Role of Climatic and
Geological Events in Generating Diversity in Ethiopian Grass Frogs (Genus Ptychadena)”
The authors present a phylogenetic and biogeographic analysis of an Ethiopian frog genus based
on multilocus DNA sequences. Overall, the study is very well written, carefully edited, and has
adequate taxonomic and geographic sampling. I have only a few minor comments to make, as
overall the study uses sound methods that are explained and presented well, and the results and
discussion are clear, informative, and appropriate. I appreciate the inclusion of the species
descriptions within the manuscript.
Minor points:
A recent paper which was presumably overlooked by the authors has been published by Freilich
et al. on the phylogeography of Ethiopian frogs. This paper includes four species in Ptychadena.
In addition to citing this paper, the authors should include a brief discussion of how their study
corroborates or conflicts with this paper.
Freilich et al. 2016. Comparative Phylogeography of Ethiopian anurans: impact of the Great Rift
Valley and Pleistocene climate change. BMC Evolutionary Biology.
Lines 38-39: The last sentence would be clearer if it was rephrased to indicate explicitly that the
two new lowland species are sp. nov.
Lines 96-97: What is the name of the other amphibian genus? Wouldn’t hurt to name it.
Lines 131-132: Are you sure that this test is Fu and Li’s DF or was Fu and Li’s F or F* test carried
out?
The results section of the manuscript should also include whether demographic changes were
supported (population size) as these statistics also test for demographic changes in populations.
Lines 146-148: STRUCTURE and Structurama are generally considered population clustering
algorithms rather than “species discovery” programs. I think it would be helpful to distinguish
briefly species discovery from validation here.
Lines 176-178: Why were these population sizes and root ages chosen? Include a rational here.
Lines 193-194: How were individuals assigned to species for the species tree analysis? Why was
the mt locus included in *BEAST but not BP&P?
Line 215: Change to “is considered”. Citation for this assertion?
Line 245: Period after last sentence.
Lines 276-277: add “or greater” or use symbol for equal than or greater.
Lines 364-379: There is no Distribution section for this new species, why?
Lines 380-395: There is no Distribution section for this new species, why?

Figure 2: The legend describes the tree as being of “all Ptychadena”. However, this gene tree
collapses all of the highland taxa. Why were all the Highland taxa collapsed? The legend should
reflect that the tree is only of lowland taxa at the species level.

label_comment_2
The ms should be framed accordingly to the most current knowledge. Frelich et al. (2016) have
recently published a paper addressing the inter-specific genetic structure of many ethiopian
frogs, including Ptychadena, using genetics and species distribution modeling. Specifically the
four species modeled here by means of SDM, have already been modeled in this previous work.
Although this published work does not affect the taxonomic dimension of the work (for which I
am not an expert) it clearly sets the stage for the ecological dimension, as well as for the
discussion on the intra-specfic population structures.
In addition, some more info is needed on the SDM:
- What is the sample size for each species?
4
- Why the authors did not use a threshold to turn the continuous map into a binary one? The
continuous map might be misleading.
- Given the high resolution of the models (1km). Was any filtering methods applied to the
occurrence data, to avoid data clumpling?

The ms RSOS-170021.R1 describes the diversification patterns of frogs (Ptychadena) in Ethiopia
and their drivers. On my first review I asked to integrate this work within current knowledge
(mostly a very similar paper published very recently by Freilich et al). The authors have done
that, and for the most part of the paper, that it is the most important one (i.e. diversification and
drivers) I do not have any critic. However there is one area of overlap between the two papers,
the niche modeling, that remain problematic, in my opinion. It should be said that, as I discuss
below, the modeling part is a minor part of the ms. The niche models are problematic in this
paper for two reasons: a) their reliability and b) their significance in relation to the content of the
paper.
Regarding their reliability, the authors develop niche models for four species that have already
been develop in Freilich et al (2016) with significantly larger sample sizes (in 3 out of 4 species)
and the resulting predictive maps barely resemble those shown in Freilich et al. (2016).
Obviously, we do not know what models are more correct, but there are two signs that suggest
that the models show here are not reliable. Firstly their AUC values are quite low (although there
is not a general rule to evaluate AUC values, I would say that, in my experience, values AUC <0.8
are worrisomely low in modeling). AUC values in Freilich et al are much higher, although again
AUC values among different dataset are not comparable. Secondly, the sample size is much
lower in this paper than in Freilich et al (2016), what, as the authors indicate, could be the cause
of the low AUC. In any case, the low sample size is likely not be the only reason for the low AUC
values, and other reasons (e.g. a biased sampling) might be acting too.
Regarding the significance for the paper, the main contribution of the paper is the taxonomic
clarification of the genus Ptychadena and the discussion on the environmental drivers of that
diversification. Overall these diversification process occurred million years ago, and niche models
for the present time actually contribute very little to the paper.
Taking into account these two points, that the models contribute very little and that there are
serious signs indicating that they are not reliable, my indication would be to remove them for the
paper, unless the authors have a very good reason that support their reliability and their need for
the general discussion of the paper.

overall the study uses sound methods that are explained and presented well, and the results

criptions within the manuscript.
or points:
ecent paper which was presumably overlooked by the authors has been published by Freilich
l. on the phylogeography of Ethiopian frogs. This paper includes four species in Ptychadena.
ddition to citing this paper, the authors should include a brief discussion of how their study
roborates or conflicts with this paper.

Valley and Pleistocene climate change. BMC Evolutionary Biology.
have integrated a discussion of this recent work into the introduction and discussion of our
er (see lines 101-107, 372-373, 544-548 and 579–585).

have included the genus name.
es 131-132: Are you sure that this test is Fu and Li’s DF or was Fu and Li’s F or F* test
ried out?
results section of the manuscript should also include whether demographic changes were
ported (population size) as these statistics also test for demographic changes in populations.
(more commonly referred to as just Fu and Li’s D) was carried out as stated in the text. We
e added a comment about the lack of evidence for demographic changes on line 257: “Fu and
s DF statistic was not significant for any of the loci studied, indicating that none of these genes
under selection and that there has been no recent population growth.”
es 146-148: STRUCTURE and Structurama are generally considered population clustering
orithms rather than “species discovery” programs. I think it would be helpful to distinguish
efly species discovery from validation here.
thank the reviewer for this helpful comment. We have added a sentence explaining the
inction (Lines 156–158), and we have also elaborated and clarified that STRUCTURE and
ucturama are population clustering algorithms frequently used to assign individuals to
ative species, while spedeSTEM aims to identify species-level differentiation.
es 176-178: Why were these population sizes and root ages chosen? Include a rational here.
added more reasoning for our rationale (lines 192–196). It was necessary to use a diffuse
r, due to a lack of prior information, and chose ß values that resulted in reasonable means.
ditionally, Freilich et al. (2014) performed the same analysis with a smaller dataset and
orted that the results were not sensitive to changes in the prior.
es 193-194: How were individuals assigned to species for the species tree analysis?
y was the mt locus included in *BEAST but not BP&P?
assigned individuals to populations in BP&P based on mt DNA results and the results of
ilich et al. (2014). We did not use the mtDNA to avoid the circularity of testing the validity of
ulations using the same data we used to define populations. We have clarified this in the text.
included the mt locus in the *BEAST analysis because OTUs were defined based on species
mitation and validation results, not just mtDNA clustering, for this analysis. Also, this made
divergence time estimates more comparable to those of Freilich et al (2014), who used the
e loci, but without fossil information, to estimate divergence times in *BEAST. This has also
n clarified in the text (Lines 212–218).

ms should be framed accordingly to the most current knowledge. Frelich et al. (2016) have
ently published a paper addressing the inter-specific genetic structure of many ethiopian
gs, including Ptychadena, using genetics and species distribution modeling. Specifically the
r species modeled here by means of SDM, have already been modeled in this previous work.
hough this published work does not affect the taxonomic dimension of the work (for which I
not an expert) it clearly sets the stage for the ecological dimension, as well as for the
cussion on the intra-specfic population structures.
have integrated discussions of this recently published paper into our introduction and
cussion.
ddition, some more info is needed on the SDM:
hat is the sample size for each species?
thank the reviewer for suggesting this and we have added the requested information to Table
hy the authors did not use a threshold to turn the continuous map into a binary one? The
tinuous map might be misleading.
have now included binary maps in the supporting information for the article, in addition to
continuous maps provided in the main text.
iven the high resolution of the models (1km). Was any filtering methods applied to the
urrence data, to avoid data clumpling?
chose not to use spatial rarefication or subsampling, due to our small number of observations
We also note that locally dense record might reflect actual habitat suitability [1].

ms RSOS-170021.R1 describes the diversification patterns of frogs (Ptychadena) in Ethiopia
their drivers. On my first review I asked to integrate this work within current knowledge
stly a very similar paper published very recently by Freilich et al). The authors have done
t, and for the most part of the paper, that it is the most important one (i.e. diversification and
vers) I do not have any critic. However there is one area of overlap between the two papers,
niche modeling, that remain problematic, in my opinion. It should be said that, as I discuss
ow, the modeling part is a minor part of the ms. The niche models are problematic in this
er for two reasons: a) their reliability and b) their significance in relation to the content of
paper.
arding their reliability, the authors develop niche models for four species that have already
n develop in Freilich et al (2016) with significantly larger sample sizes (in 3 out of 4 species)
the resulting predictive maps barely resemble those shown in Freilich et al. (2016).
viously, we do not know what models are more correct, but there are two signs that suggest
t the models show here are not reliable. Firstly their AUC values are quite low (although
re is not a general rule to evaluate AUC values, I would say that, in my experience, values
C <0.8 are worrisomely low in modeling). AUC values in Freilich et al are much higher,
ough again AUC values among different dataset are not comparable. Secondly, the sample
is much lower in this paper than in Freilich et al (2016), what, as the authors indicate, could
he cause of the low AUC. In any case, the low sample size is likely not be the only reason for
low AUC values, and other reasons (e.g. a biased sampling) might be acting too.
arding the significance for the paper, the main contribution of the paper is the taxonomic
rification of the genus Ptychadena and the discussion on the environmental drivers of that
ersification. Overall these diversification process occurred million years ago, and niche
dels for the present time actually contribute very little to the paper.
ing into account these two points, that the models contribute very little and that there are
ous signs indicating that they are not reliable, my indication would be to remove them for the
er, unless the authors have a very good reason that support their reliability and their need
the general discussion of the paper.
agree with the reviewer that the niche models contribute little to the paper and, due to less
a, are potentially less reliable than those of Freilich et al. We have therefore removed these
dels from the paper, as suggested.
