In this paper, the authors reported a networking oxygen-deficient nano TiO2-x/ carbon fiber
membrane was achieved by combining the electrospinning process with a hot-press sintering
method and directly used as a self-standing anode. This fiber electrode shows the high capacity
of 464 mAh/g at a current density of 100 mA/g. This work is systematic and the corresponding
characterization is good. Furthermore, there are some modifications that should be made to
bolster the scientific merit of the application in Li-ion battery before I can recommend publication
in Royal Society Open Science. In particular, I request that the authors address the following
points:
1. In page 1, line 16, ‘a three-dimensional (3D) networking oxygen-deficient nano TiO2-x/
carbon fiber’ should be reconsidered owing to typical definition for 3D.
2. For better understanding the oxygen-deficient effect, the XPS spectrum for TiO2 power
should be provided and the corresponding discussion should be added.
3. It is better for that the addition of N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms for carbon fiber
without TiO2 in this manuscript to provide more information on porous structure of composite
fiber.
4. In Figure 9, the 10th charge-discharge curves should be consider for better
understanding the Li-ion storage process in these fiber electrode.

Nano TiO2 as an anode material for Li-ion battery has attracted much attention in recent years.
Improving the specific capacity and electrical conductivity of TiO2 is the main focus for its
practical application. This paper reported a three-dimensional networked oxygen-deficient nano
3
TiO2-x/carbon fiber membrane fabricated by electrospinning process and a hot-press sintering
method. It has high capacity and electric conductivity, and can be directly used as a self-standing
anode. The structure design and results are very interesting. In addition, they provide a new
approach to improve the electrochemical performances of conventional TiO2 as anode material.
Therefore, I recommend its publication after addressing the following minor issues.
1. In page 3, the XPS of Ti 2p peaks at 464.9 eV should be Ti 2p 1/2, not Ti 2P 2/1.
2. In Fig. 10, it should be noted how to calculate the specific capacity of the TiO2/C fiber
electrode. Is it based on the mass of TiO2 or total electrode? Is the voltage window 1~3 V?
3. In Fig. 11, is the voltage window 1~3 V? Why does the cycling performance curve have an
obvious fluctuation?
4. Authors need to read the whole paper carefully to find the spelling, subscript, and grammatical
errors. For example, in line 31-33 of page 5, ''combing TiO2 with porous carbon fibers could,
meanwhile could generate abundant interface" is a grammatically wrong sentence.

***************************
Appendix A
Response to Referees
Dear editor and reviewers,
Thanks for your comments on my manuscript, we have revised or explained the
doubts one by one as follows,
Reviewer 1,
1. In page 1, line 16, ‘a three-dimensional (3D) networking oxygen-deficient nano
TiO2-x/ carbon fiber’ should be reconsidered owing to typical definition for 3D.
In this paper, we prepared a self-standing TiO2/C fiber membrane electrode by
electrospinning method, this fiber membrane electrode has a long-range conductive
networks with a thickness of ~200um, therefore, we use ‘3D networking’ to reveal the
characteristics of the three dimensional conductive networks in the whole electrode.
Just because of this 3D network characteristics, the prepared electrode has a
self-standing property. This definition for 3D has been reported in our previous works
such as ‘Electrochimica Acta.2016, 212: 898-904; RSC Advances, 2016, 6(75):
71574-71580; Energy technology. 2016, 4(9): 1047-1052’ .
2. For better understanding the oxygen-deficient effect, the XPS spectrum for TiO2
power should be provided and the corresponding discussion should be added.
Yes, for better understanding the oxygen-deficient effect, the XPS for pure TiO2
powder has been added as a supplementary figure(Fig.1S), it can be seen that the pure
TiO2 just shows single Ti4+.
3. It is better for that the addition of N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms for carbon
fiber without TiO2 in this manuscript to provide more information on porous structure
of composite fiber.
Yes, the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution for
carbon fiber without TiO2 has been added as a supplementary figure (Fig.2S), the
specific surface area is 357.7m2/g, but the pore size is mainly distributed at 3~4nm,
smaller than that of TiO2/C fiber.
4.In Figure 9, the 10th charge-discharge curves should be consider for better
understanding the Li-ion storage process in these fiber electrode.
OK, the 10th charge-discharge curves had been added in Fig.9. It can be seen that
the 10th charge-discharge curves show a good overlap with the 2nd charge-discharge
curves, suggesting the TiO2-x/C fiber membrane electrode has a good reversibility
after the second charge-discharge process.
Reviewer 2,
1. In page 3, the XPS of Ti 2p peaks at 464.9 eV should be Ti 2p 1/2, not Ti 2P 2/1.
Yes, the XPS of Ti 2p peaks at 464.9 eV should be Ti 2p 1/2.
2. In Fig. 10, it should be noted how to calculate the specific capacity of the TiO2/C
fiber electrode. Is it based on the mass of TiO2 or total electrode? Is the voltage
window 1~3V?
In experimental and text, we have specified that the specific capacity was
calculated according to the total quality of the electrode. And the voltage window is
0~3 V for all electrochemical characterization.
3. In Fig. 11, is the voltage window 1~3 V? Why does the cycling performance curve
have an obvious fluctuation?
No, the voltage window is 0~3 V. We were also aware of the cycling performance
curve having an obvious fluctuation, and deeply investigated this phenomenon, we
found this phenomenon was caused by battery test environment, that is, with the
fluctuation of room temperature, the cycling performance curve will fluctuate
accordingly, when the temperature is stable, the cycling performance curve is also
smooth.
4. Authors need to read the whole paper carefully to find the spelling, subscript, and
grammatical errors. For example, in line 31-33 of page 5, ''combing TiO2 with porous
carbon fibers could, meanwhile could generate abundant interface" is a grammatically
wrong sentence.
We had revised the grammatical errors all over the manuscript as red font tagging
in the text.
RSC Subject Editor:
Please note that the referees have made a number of recommendations regarding
changes to the manuscript that are required before publication can proceed. Please list
the changes made in a covering letter. In addition, please have the entire paper read
carefully by someone with a working knowledge of the English language to ensure
that any grammatical errors are removed.
We have carefully revised the grammatical errors all over the manuscript as red
font tagging, and the revised edition was reviewed by a professor(Mi Jian-li) , who
had worked for several years at Aarhus University.
