The article "Bed separation backfill to reduce surface cracking due to mining under thick and
hard conglomerate - a case study" is written in a clear and understandable way.
In this paper, the discontinuous surface deformation mechanism in the Huafeng coal mine was
analyzed through a similar material simulation test. Based on these, the bed separation backfill
was proposed and adopted to control surface deformation and to protect the Luli bridge. The
mechanism of surface cracking controlled by bed separation backfill was discussed.
Formal remarks:
- the summary reflects the essence of the study,
- the presented results are interesing,
- the terminology used in the article is correct and consistent with the current norms,
- the visuals have been properly selected,
- the choice of the used literature is relevant and sufficient. In the text of the article, literature was
cited into numerical terms. The references contains a list of literature in the order of quoting.
The structure of the article is correct. The relevant sections are chosen in a suitable way.

The continuous and discontinuous surface deformations can damage buildings and
infrastructure, especially the discontinuous deformation. This paper provides a good research in
terms of bed separation backfill to reduce surface cracking due to mining under thick and hard
conglomerate. The achievements are important for understanding the discontinuous deformation
3
mechanism of surface under thick and hard conglomerate. The work is potential to publish,
however, there are several issues that the authors have to take care of them:
(1)The paper needs to be revised to improve its writing style and English language. There are
some wrong words, grammar, etc.
(2)Since this journal is an international one, suggest to review and add some international
references.
(3)The authors should illustratehow to obtain the date in Table 1.
(4)In Fig.7, the authors should definitely mark the position of the bed separation. The author
should provide the clear photos in Fig. 6.
(5) What is the level of Luli bridge’s defense? What is the maximum allowable surface
deformation? Did the surface subsidence of 251 mm exceed the maximum allowable
deformation?

Your paper should initiate vivid discussion among the specialists regarding the method for
prediction of place and time of occurence of bed separation zones above a coal seam during its
mining extraction. In experience of Polish and Australian mining occurence of bed searation
zones is hardly predictible, because in specific point (bore hole) such a void could exist only for
very limited time, while the progress of subsidence is fast (and is connected with advance of the
longwall, depth, and mechanical properties of the strata in the rock mass). In Table 1 you preset
data, which suggest that your model simulates only denisties of particular rock types.
Considering presence of gypsum and calcium carbonate you also simulate Young modulus,
compressive strengh and maybe other mechanicalal properties, what seems to be necessary, but
you did not mention that aspect.
Considering large amount of fill mixture ant its good flowability, you have backfilled not the bed
separation zones (or not only them), bu all cracks and voids in the rock mass (especially below
the horizon of expected bed separation zones), what resulted obviously in limitation of
4
subsidence. In simple words - the reality is not so simple as one take an impression after reading
your work, but nevertheless it is very valuable and interesting input into the problem of
limitation of subsidence using filling of voids occuring at a depth shallower than the mining
operations level.

28-Jun-2019
Dear Dr Yin,
The editors assigned to your paper ("Bed separation backfill to reduce surface cracking due to
mining under thick and hard conglomerate - a case study") have now received comments from
reviewers. We would like you to revise your paper in accordance with the referee and Associate
Editor suggestions which can be found below (not including confidential reports to the Editor).
Please note this decision does not guarantee eventual acceptance.
Please submit a copy of your revised paper before 21-Jul-2019. Please note that the revision
deadline will expire at 00.00am on this date. If we do not hear from you within this time then it
will be assumed that the paper has been withdrawn. In exceptional circumstances, extensions
may be possible if agreed with the Editorial Office in advance. We do not allow multiple rounds
of revision so we urge you to make every effort to fully address all of the comments at this stage.
If deemed necessary by the Editors, your manuscript will be sent back to one or more of the
original reviewers for assessment. If the original reviewers are not available, we may invite new
reviewers.
To revise your manuscript, log into http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision. Revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your
Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you must respond to the comments made by the
referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". Please use this to
document how you have responded to the comments, and the adjustments you have made. In
order to expedite the processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in
your response.
In addition to addressing all of the reviewers' and editor's comments please also ensure that your
revised manuscript contains the following sections as appropriate before the reference list:
• Ethics statement (if applicable)

Editorial comments to the Author:
You'll see that the reviewers are largely in favour of publication of your paper, and the Editors
are in agreement, based on the referee feedback. However, as reviewer two has a number of
(mostly minor) comments, and recommends the paper is sent for a language editing service
(https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/language-polishing/) to improve the written
English, we would like you to revise the paper - this ensures you've sufficient time to complete
the modifications needed, including seeking language advice, before resubmitting for
consideration.
