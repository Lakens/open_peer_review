Summary
This study looks at synchrony in 65 butterfly species that were monitored over a 26 year period
across Northern California. The authors use a structural equation modeling approach to
separately measure the effects of dispersal and weather factors in synchrony within each of the 65
species. This seems to be an impressive data set and the large number of species increases the
robustness and significance of the result. In my estimation this is a novel work that will be
worthy of publication if specific problems are corrected. The paper is generally well written,
although I needed to reread to understand the entirety of the work. I can’t identify how to make
the manuscript more readable, however. The conclusion seem to be supported, although I feel
more transparency in the methods is required to fully make this judgement (see below).
Major Comments
The authors state that some time series are shorter than others, but do not give specifics. This
information needs to be available so the reader can understand the extent of the data behind the
conclusions.
Lines 132. Why not compare migratory to non-migratory butterflies (instead of migratory
butterflies to all butterflies) to get a clearer contrast between the two groups?
Line 144. In this section, it isn’t clear to me where the data came from to calculate the factors
“Dispersal 1” and “Dispersal 2”, nor exactly how these were calculated. The reader needs more
information on exactly how the maximum likelihood factor was calculated, given the original
values of the wingspan etc. for each species, and the final values after reducing dimensionality
should be reported. It looks as if the data were taken from references 30-38 for all 65 species, but
if not, sources should be reported and values should be provided in the Supplement. The reader
should be able to redo your analyses if given the data.
Line 189. I believe this equation has a range from 0 to 1, so I don’t understand how pij is a
number of presences. shouldn’t this be a proportion?
Lines 230. There are methods for critically determining whether synchrony is significant or not,
instead of using the arbitrary value of 0.1.
Minor Comments
Line 29. Delete “both”?
Line 78. References are needed to support the idea that these factors are related to dispersal
propensity.
Line 79. Similarly, it isn’t clear here how sensitivity to climatic variation was measured in each
species.
Line 93. Change “was” to “were”.
Line 104. Change “that” to “the”?
Line 108. I believe you use the word “presence” in other places, and “incidence” here. I suggest
choosing one term and using it consistently for easy reading.
Line 124. Here and elsewhere, why not say “synchrony” instead of “synchronicity”?

label_comment_2
This is an interesting paper that uses an extensive survey of butterflies to compare effects of
dispersal traits and climate sensitivity on interspecific variation in spatial synchrony. I found the
paper to be generally well-written, and some of the methods, e.g., structural equation modelling,
the use of factor analysis to summarize multiple dispersal-related traits, have advantages over
earlier studies with similar goals and approach. There are a number of places where added
context or (what I believe to be) relatively straightforward adjustments would strengthen the
arguments made in this manuscript, and I had a few methodological concerns that I don’t believe
to be fatal but deserve some attention.
I note also that, although there is precedent in the literature for comparing levels of synchrony
across species to make inferences about the roles of different drivers, it yields in my opinion a
weaker argument for drivers of synchrony than modelling variation in synchrony among
populations of individual species, and then summarizing model results for many species. The
distinction is subtle, but I think not semantic, as the former assumes a degree of correspondence
between trait variation and mechanism. There are newer approaches that offer improvements
over traditional means of attributing drivers of synchrony from single-species data. See Haynes et
al. 2013 (cited by the authors) and Gouveia et al. 2016 (full reference below) for examples. To be
clear, I see value in the approach the authors have taken and am looking mainly for my questions
and comments below (which deal with strengthening the study at hand) to be addressed. But I
hope the authors will consider whether the alternate approach I raised would be useful here or in
related work, especially as these approaches can better address spatial variation in synchrony,
such as is evident in Fig. 1e. My specific comments are below:
Abstract/Introduction: My initial impressions were that this study would analyze drivers of
synchrony for individual species rather than compare how the overall degree of synchrony in a
species depended on climate and dispersal. It’s not entirely obvious what gave me this
impression so I unfortunately have few specific recommendations for how to improve this—but I
do suggest changing L 31 to read something like “… support for dispersal- versus climate-driven
models of interspecific variation in synchrony …”
L 93-114: What does the distribution of distances between sites look like, and how does this
compare to typical/maximum dispersal distances for these species? Would we even expect, a
priori, that dispersal would be important for the synchrony of non-migratory species given these
distances?
L 128-132: I admittedly have little experience with SEM, but it is my understanding that one
defines a structure of how variables are ostensibly related to one another, and that this can be
much more complex than a typical linear model because of interrelationships between variables.
The structure of the models used here is unclear to me, beyond which “main effects” are being
4
tested. I am also interested in the rationale behind the chosen structure, and whether any
alternates were considered. Also, did the authors consider including a variable like “average
distance between sampling sites”? Distance is nearly always invoked, in some form, in synchrony
studies, and it seems rather important to include this effect here since the number of sites that
synchrony was averaged over changed from species to species. Even if its inclusion didn’t
qualitatively affect the main results, I would expect it to improve model performance.
L 166: How spatially synchronous are local climate conditions? This seems assumed, but it is an
important consideration since conditions must be synchronous to produce synchrony. Evaluating
synchrony in climate variables would help shore up the argument that when sensitivity to
climate predicts interspecific variation in synchrony, that this implies that climate drives
synchrony. Also, why Bayes? This seems unnecessarily complicated. I don’t think it’s wrong, I’m
just curious what it gives that a more standard linear modelling approach doesn’t.
L 190: Were any lagged effects of climate considered, either here or in prior work?
L 253-256: Unless I’ve missed something it appears this result could also be explained by local
climate variables being negatively correlated with the ENSO index. Did the authors check this?
I’m concerned about collinearity among climate variables, especially between ENSO and local
climate since it seems like it could affect the parameter estimates used to quantify sensitivity to
climate.
L 285-293: I don’t believe there is a passage in the Methods corresponding with this result.
L 332: Is there any sense what traits make a species “volatile”?
Discussion: I thought the differences with and without migratory species were quite important,
and the discussion section doesn’t really capture that.
Fig. 1b: I’m curious how the tails of this distribution might be affected by sample size, and
whether extreme values should be trusted if they result from (say) n=3 time series.
Fig. 1e: It appears that low-elevation and Sierra Nevada sites, as separate groups, are highly
synchronized but the groups have different patterns, resulting in reduced overall synchrony. The
authors’ methods cannot account for this. I am curious whether this is an isolated case or a more
general phenomenon more broadly affecting their results. There are relatively new approaches to
dealing with geographic variation in synchrony, e.g. Haynes et al. (2013) [cited by the authors so I
do not provide a reference here] and Gouveia, et al (2016) Dissecting geographic variation in
population synchrony using the common vole in central Europe as a test bed Ecology and
Evolution 6: 212-218. These are approaches for single-species datasets, but they might inspire
improvements. It may be worth considering separating low-elevation and high-elevation sites for
non-migratory species, or at least a subset that clearly have different dynamics like this one.

The authors have done a good job of addressing reviewer comments. The manuscript is well
written and nearly ready for publication. I would, however, like for the authors to consider one
point and perhaps respond with a minor revision to correct the possible misconception.
My interpretation is that the authors consider each location a population and the entire study
area the metapopulation? If so, then I want to point out that, while it is true that synchrony will
tend to increase the chance of metapopulation extinction, it will not (alone) cause a decreasing
trend in number of occupied patches. Instead it just will create greater variation around the
quasi-equilibrium, which in turn will increase the chance of population extinction (but will also
increase the chance of 100% occupancy).
Instead, the decreasing trend in number of occupied patches with increasing synchrony may be
conceptually explained by Allee-like effects that act at the metapopulation scale (see P
Amarasekare. Allee effects in metapopulation dynamics. The American Naturalist. , 1998,
Vol.152(2), p.298-302). In this framework, each population would be analogous to an individual
in the typical Allee effect model, so as the number of occupied patches tends fluctuate more
greatly, due to increased synchrony, there is an increase in attraction to the extinction condition. I
suggest that the authors include this reference to justify the analysis of trend in occupancy.

The manuscript is greatly improved from the first draft. I commend the authors for their work
and thank them for carefully considering the earlier reviews. I am satisfied with the revisions to
the manuscript, and have only a couple minor comments:
Lines 206-209: I thank the authors for this addition and only add that it would be helpful to
indicate here what criteria were used to determine that weather was spatially synchronous, for
example that mean correlation coefficients were >0.1.
Line 253: I suggest being more precise by simply reporting “(i.e., synchrony index >0.1)”

The authors have done a good job of addressing reviewer comments. The manuscript is well
written and nearly ready for publication. I would, however, like for the authors to consider one
point and perhaps respond with a minor revision to correct the possible misconception.
My interpretation is that the authors consider each location a population and the entire study
area the metapopulation? If so, then I want to point out that, while it is true that synchrony will
tend to increase the chance of metapopulation extinction, it will not (alone) cause a decreasing
trend in number of occupied patches. Instead it just will create greater variation around the
quasi-equilibrium, which in turn will increase the chance of population extinction (but will also
increase the chance of 100% occupancy).
Instead, the decreasing trend in number of occupied patches with increasing synchrony may be
conceptually explained by Allee-like effects that act at the metapopulation scale (see P
Amarasekare. Allee effects in metapopulation dynamics. The American Naturalist. , 1998,
Vol.152(2), p.298-302). In this framework, each population would be analogous to an individual
in the typical Allee effect model, so as the number of occupied patches tends fluctuate more
greatly, due to increased synchrony, there is an increase in attraction to the extinction condition. I
suggest that the authors include this reference to justify the analysis of trend in occupancy.

s study looks at synchrony in 65 butterfly species that were monitored over a 26 year period
oss Northern California. The authors use a structural equation modeling approach to
arately measure the effects of dispersal and weather factors in synchrony within each of the
species. This seems to be an impressive data set and the large number of species increases
robustness and significance of the result. In my estimation this is a novel work that will be
thy of publication if specific problems are corrected. The paper is generally well written,
ough I needed to reread to understand the entirety of the work. I can’t identify how to make
manuscript more readable, however. The conclusion seem to be supported, although I feel
re transparency in the methods is required to fully make this judgement (see below).

ues of the wingspan etc. for each species, and the final values after reducing dimensionality
uld be reported. It looks as if the data were taken from references 30-38 for all 65 species,
if not, sources should be reported and values should be provided in the Supplement. The

generation of a p value for each index (because it involves averaging correlation
fficients). Since our analysis did not rely on the generation of p values for each index we did
pursue additional analyses here.

mments to the Author(s)
s is an interesting paper that uses an extensive survey of butterflies to compare effects of
persal traits and climate sensitivity on interspecific variation in spatial synchrony. I found the
er to be generally well-written, and some of the methods, e.g., structural equation modelling,
use of factor analysis to summarize multiple dispersal-related traits, have advantages over
lier studies with similar goals and approach. There are a number of places where added
text or (what I believe to be) relatively straightforward adjustments would strengthen the
uments made in this manuscript, and I had a few methodological concerns that I don’t
eve to be fatal but deserve some attention.
te also that, although there is precedent in the literature for comparing levels of synchrony
oss species to make inferences about the roles of different drivers, it yields in my opinion a
aker argument for drivers of synchrony than modelling variation in synchrony among
ulations of individual species, and then summarizing model results for many species. The
inction is subtle, but I think not semantic, as the former assumes a degree of
respondence between trait variation and mechanism. There are newer approaches that offer
rovements over traditional means of attributing drivers of synchrony from single-species
a. See Haynes et al. 2013 (cited by the authors) and Gouveia et al. 2016 (full reference
ow) for examples. To be clear, I see value in the approach the authors have taken and am
king mainly for my questions and comments below (which deal with strengthening the study
and) to be addressed. But I hope the authors will consider whether the alternate approach I
ed would be useful here or in related work, especially as these approaches can better
ress spatial variation in synchrony, such as is evident in Fig. 1e.
nk you for the insight. If I am understanding your suggestion correctly, you suggest that the
put of analyses focusing on the drivers of synchrony at each population for each taxon be
regated. For instance, the role of distance decay in synchrony could be ascertained and
n aggregated across taxa. We agree that this is a very intriguing line of thought. We will
sider this approach for further work using our dataset.
specific comments are below:
tract/Introduction: My initial impressions were that this study would analyze drivers of
chrony for individual species rather than compare how the overall degree of synchrony in a
cies depended on climate and dispersal. It’s not entirely obvious what gave me this
ression so I unfortunately have few specific recommendations for how to improve this—but I
suggest changing L 31 to read something like “… support for dispersal- versus climate-driven
dels of interspecific variation in synchrony …”
have made this change. Additionally, we added the following sentences to the abstract to
phasize our focus on interspecific variation in synchrony.
e degree of spatial synchrony exhibited by each butterfly species was calculated and used as
sponse variable in all models. This unique approach allowed us to investigate whether
rspecific variation in response to climate or dispersal propensity was most predictive of
rspecific variation in synchrony among butterfly species. ”
3-114: What does the distribution of distances between sites look like, and how does this
pare to typical/maximum dispersal distances for these species? Would we even expect, a
ri, that dispersal would be important for the synchrony of non-migratory species given these
ances?
ortunately little is known regarding the dispersal ability of many of the taxa included in our
dy. Indeed, to our knowledge, no systematic study of Western butterfly dispersal capacity
been conducted. However, we do know that the migratory taxa included in our study often
perse between sites. For instance, D. plexippus (the monarch) disperses from coastal
ifornia throughout the intermountain West, and V. cardui (the painted lady) flies to our study
s all the way from Mexico. Similarly several altitudinal migrants included in the study (e.g.
mphalis spp.) certainly fly from lower elevations up to the higher elevation sites (sometimes in
at abundances). Regarding non-migratory taxa it is less clear how common dispersal of
viduals among sites occurs. However, observations of “stray” taxa at sites where no
eding is known to occur are routine occurrences, therefore it seems likely that under
orable circumstances many taxa occasionally disperse between sites.
The main motivation we had for separately analyzing migratory taxa, was that it allowed
o better understand the contribution of dispersal to synchrony for these exceptionally vagile
cies. We have tried to make this rationale more clear in the text. Starting at line 151: “For all
dels, we further investigated the influence of dispersal by removing nine butterfly species that
ergo annual migrations (including latitudinal and elevational migrations) and observed
nges in model fit and path coefficients (Table S1). Since these migratory taxa are known to
extreme dispersers, they represent a subset of species whose variation in synchrony is likely to
nfluenced by traits predictive of dispersal propensity and thus their removal can provide an
rmative contrast to analyses solely encompassing more sedentary butterflies. ”
28-132: I admittedly have little experience with SEM, but it is my understanding that one
ines a structure of how variables are ostensibly related to one another, and that this can be
ch more complex than a typical linear model because of interrelationships between variables.
structure of the models used here is unclear to me, beyond which “main effects” are being
ed. I am also interested in the rationale behind the chosen structure, and whether any
rnates were considered.
, you are correct in that to construct an SEM one hypothesizes causal relationships among
iables (e.g. dispersal propensity affects synchrony, and not the reverse). The structure of the
dels is depicted in Fig. 3, where each path denotes a hypothesized causal relationship. The
rall model fit provides insight into how well the hypothesized structure explains the data. The
ual mathematics rely on how the structure hypothesized would necessitate certain
iance/covariance relationships within the underlying data, if those relationships are not found
n the model is not supported. We hypothesized a priori that either dispersal, or response to
mate (or both) would influence synchrony and the proportion of sites occupied along the
sect, and these may influence population trend. Consequently, this is how we structured the
dels. We hope the background material provided in the introduction is sufficient justification
the possible role of dispersal and response to climate. A useful overview of SEMs can be
nd in Jim Grace's book, "Structural equation modeling in natural systems," which we cite in
Methods.
o, did the authors consider including a variable like “average distance between sampling
s”? Distance is nearly always invoked, in some form, in synchrony studies, and it seems
er important to include this effect here since the number of sites that synchrony was
raged over changed from species to species. Even if its inclusion didn’t qualitatively affect
main results, I would expect it to improve model performance.
esponse to this comment, we developed new path models with a standardized value of
ximum distance between sites for each butterfly species. Initially we felt that average number
ites occupied was a good proxy for distance, so we did not include distance in the model. In
, average sites occupied and maximum distance between two sites for each species were 76%
related, suggesting that they are identifying similar aspects of a butterfly's distribution within
se sites. The new models with distance between sites performed similarly to the initial models
the overall conclusions drawn from each model remained the same. Therefore, we have
ided to use the original variable, average number of sites occupied, as a proxy for distance.
We added a paragraph to this effect starting at line 145: “We also considered including
ximum distance between sampling sites as a covariate, but found that it was highly correlated
h average number of sites occupied (Pearson’s Correlation = 0.76); suggesting that average
mber of sites occupied served as a good proxy for distance between sampling sites.
thermore, the incorporation of maximum distance between sites did not improve model
formance or change the overall conclusions drawn from each model; therefore we did not
ude maximum distance between sampling sites in SEMs.”
66: How spatially synchronous are local climate conditions? This seems assumed, but it is
important consideration since conditions must be synchronous to produce synchrony.
luating synchrony in climate variables would help shore up the argument that when
sitivity to climate predicts interspecific variation in synchrony, that this implies that climate
es synchrony. Also, why Bayes? This seems unnecessarily complicated. I don’t think it’s
ng, I’m just curious what it gives that a more standard linear modelling approach doesn’t.
ile determining correlations of weather was beyond the goal of this study, we did investigate
terns of spatial synchrony for weather across all 10 sites. To decompose the variation
ompassed by the multiple weather variables in our study, we used principal coordinate
lysis (PCA). We then performed pairwise correlations with principal coordinates between
h possible pair of sites for each of the top 6 principle components (which together explained
% of the variation in underlying data) and found that all pairwise correlations were statistically
nificant. In other words, weather across all ten sites is spatially synchronous. Thank you for
suggestion. We added a brief statement in the methods outlining this analysis (line 205)
In regard to the use of Bayesian statistics for our analyses, we suggest that this
roach offers benefits over a standard linear model because information from all sites are
d to inform transect wide parameter estimates, and transect wide effects are used to inform
-specific parameters. This allows us to gain more certainty regarding parameter estimates
those sites with less observations than if we did not incorporate this prior information. We
orporated a statement to this effect starting at line 183.
90: Were any lagged effects of climate considered, either here or in prior work?
we have not considered lagged effects of climate. This would be an interesting component
uture work.
53-256: Unless I’ve missed something it appears this result could also be explained by local
ate variables being negatively correlated with the ENSO index. Did the authors check this?
concerned about collinearity among climate variables, especially between ENSO and local
ate since it seems like it could affect the parameter estimates used to quantify sensitivity to
ate.
nk you for this comment. In response to your concern we calculated correlation coefficients
ween ENSO and local climate and found significant positive correlations at some sites for
e climate variables, particularly precipitation and spring temperature variables. As
ntioned in the text, ENSO is a regional driver of climate in our study area so these
relations were to be expected. We appreciate your concern that this correlation could affect
mates of the strength of response to climate. However, the correlations we observed
ween ENSO and local weather were positive, in accordance with the driving role of ENSO.
s suggests that parameter estimates for the sensitivity to weather could be inflated to some
ent due to this correlation. However, the results shown in Fig. 3 that you mention actually
gest that sensitivity to ENSO can lead to lessened sensitivity to local weather, which is an
kely result if collinearity was artificially amplifying parameter estimates and confounding
del results.
85-293: I don’t believe there is a passage in the Methods corresponding with this result.
e we are referring to the path coefficients from the SEMs. We had briefly mentioned this
ect of the analysis in the methods, but it was very easy to overlook. To make this part of our
lyses more clear we added the following passage to our overview of the SEM approach (line
): “For each species, the average number of sites occupied (to account for variation in number of time
es available to calculate synchrony indices), the average FDP across sites (“abundance”; to account
variation in abundance), and the average inter-annual change in FDP across sites (henceforth “trend”,
measure of population increase or decrease, see Forister et al. 2010) were calculated, z-standardized,
included as covariates in SEMs to account for their influence on spatial synchrony. The inclusion of
d in each model allowed us to quantify the association between interspecific variation in synchrony
rate of inter-annual population change (for most species, populations were in decline).”
32: Is there any sense what traits make a species “volatile”?
replaced the word “volatile” with “highly fluctuating population dynamics” for clarity. In the
d paper, we did not find significant correlations with life history traits and volatility, though we
find volatile taxa tended to respond differently to weather compared to non-volatile taxa.
ecific traits we examined in that paper were geographical range, wingspan, voltinism,
rwintering life-history stage and host breadth.
cussion: I thought the differences with and without migratory species were quite important,
the discussion section doesn’t really capture that.
appreciate this suggestion and have added additional text to the discussion to highlight the
erences between migrant taxa and more sedentary butterflies. We agree that this is one of
most important results.
. 1b: I’m curious how the tails of this distribution might be affected by sample size, and
ether extreme values should be trusted if they result from (say) n=3 time series.
s is an important criticism. We think we have addressed this concern in our analyses via two
roaches. First, we included the “average occupancy” for each taxon in our models to
ount for the influence of sample size on models. Average occupancy was the average
mber of sites a given butterfly species occurred over our study period. We also included
rage fraction of day positives in our models to account for the influence of varying
ndance. To make these statistical controls more apparent to the reader, we shifted the
tion of the methods mentioning these controls to the section where we provide an overview
ur use of SEMs (starting at line 136; see comment above).
Additionally, we repeated all SEMs 1000 times while omitting nine randomly chosen
a. The output from these SEMs (Fig. 2) was very similar to that obtained from the complete
aset, which suggests that any outliers that may exist within the data due to reduced sample
es do not drastically affect our analyses.
We hope that this addresses your concern.
. 1e: It appears that low-elevation and Sierra Nevada sites, as separate groups, are highly
chronized but the groups have different patterns, resulting in reduced overall synchrony. The
hors’ methods cannot account for this. I am curious whether this is an isolated case or a
re general phenomenon more broadly affecting their results. There are relatively new
roaches to dealing with geographic variation in synchrony, e.g. Haynes et al. (2013) [cited
he authors so I do not provide a reference here] and Gouveia, et al (2016) Dissecting
graphic variation in population synchrony using the common vole in central Europe as a test
Ecology and Evolution 6: 212-218. These are approaches for single-species datasets, but
y might inspire improvements. It may be worth considering separating low-elevation and
h-elevation sites for non-migratory species, or at least a subset that clearly have different
amics like this one.
very much appreciate the suggestion to parse the dataset into montane and valley sites and
eat analyses. We agree this could be very interesting, especially in light of the influence of
ate change on the Sierra Nevada. However, such an approach would require us to repeat
analyses, including recalculating sensitivity to weather for each subset of sites, which would
atly expand the length of the paper. Consequently, we feel that this is beyond the scope of
present study, but would be an excellent avenue for future work.

*** We amended this section thus: “Our index of spatial synchrony, which measures the
correlation of changes in yearly abundances across populations [9], identified 44 out of the 65
butterfly species as having synchrony indices greater than 0.1; only 7 taxa had negative
synchrony indices, which indicated asynchronous fluctuations (minimum index value was -0.11)

The authors have done a good job of addressing reviewer comments. The manuscript is well
written and nearly ready for publication. I would, however, like for the authors to consider one
point and perhaps respond with a minor revision to correct the possible misconception.
My interpretation is that the authors consider each location a population and the entire study area
the metapopulation? If so, then I want to point out that, while it is true that synchrony will tend to
increase the chance of metapopulation extinction, it will not (alone) cause a decreasing trend in
number of occupied patches. Instead it just will create greater variation around the quasi-
equilibrium, which in turn will increase the chance of population extinction (but will also increase
the chance of 100% occupancy).
Instead, the decreasing trend in number of occupied patches with increasing synchrony may be
conceptually explained by Allee-like effects that act at the metapopulation scale (see P
Amarasekare. Allee effects in metapopulation dynamics. The American Naturalist. , 1998,
Vol.152(2), p.298-302). In this framework, each population would be analogous to an individual in
the typical Allee effect model, so as the number of occupied patches tends fluctuate more greatly,
due to increased synchrony, there is an increase in attraction to the extinction condition. I suggest
that the authors include this reference to justify the analysis of trend in occupancy.
*** This is a very useful and pertinent comment. We appreciate this reference and potential
explanation for the relationship between spatial synchrony and population trends. However, the
measurement of trend in our SEM is not a measure of patch occupancy. Instead, our “trend”
index is a measure of how the abundance of individual species has changed over 27 years at our
focal sites. If it is negative, then the abundance of a particular species has been declining.
Nevertheless, you have raised an important issue concerning this study. There are several
mechanisms for how synchrony might be associated with declines and extinction, but we can’t
really explore them in the current study. This is because we did not measure how the number of
sites occupied has changed over time either at our focal sites or in the larger area (which would
be relevant for understanding metapopulations). This is potentially an important direction for
future studies and we have modified the Discussion to address this possibility (see lines 366
onwards; we included in this section the citation suggested by the reviewer).
