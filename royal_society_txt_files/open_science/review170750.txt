The work presented the calculated properties of two materials AgInTe2 and AgGaTe 2 which
were based on the first principles theory. The manuscript is well articulated and the scientific part
looks sound in whole. I think the manuscript can be acceptable after a few minor corrections:
1). It is confusing to dry the comments that “DOS near the edge of the valence band is slightly
steeper than that near the edge of the conduction band, which leads to a considerable p-type
Seebeck coefficient.” The results are purely speculated and should be backed by more
calculations/experimental results.
2). About “GGA+U”, the author used U =4.5 eV from Ag oxide, have the authors checked other
values of Ueff? The readers may want to more about the details, related studies can be referenced:

3). “Now, we turn to the lattice dynamical properties of the chalcopyrite structure compound

1. Summary
The electronic, vibrational and thermoelectric transport characteristics of AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2 with chalcopyrite
23 structure have been investigated. The electronic structures are calculated using the density-functional theory (DFT) within
24 the generalized gradient approximation considering the Hubbard-U (GGA+U) corrected functional. The band gaps of
25 AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2 are much larger than previous standard GGA functional results and agree well with the existing
26 experimental data. The effective mass of the hole and the shape of density of states near the edge of the valence band
27 indicate AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2 are considerable p-type thermoelectric materials. An analysis of lattice dynamics shows
28 the low thermal conductivities of AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2. The thermoelectric transport properties' dependence on carrier
29 concentration for p-type AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2 in a wide range of temperatures has been studied in detail. The results
30 show that p-type AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2 at 800 K can achieve the merit values of 0.91 and 1.38 at about 2.12×1020 cm-3
31 and 1.97×1020 cm-3 carrier concentrations, respectively. This indicates p-type AgGaTe2 is a promising thermoelectric
32 material at high temperature.

34 2. Introduction
35 Thermoelectric (TE) material, which can be used in thermoelectric devices to convert waste heat into electricity without
36 any mechanical component, has garnered great attention in recent years given the challenges brought about by the global
37 energy crisis. The conversion efficiency between heat and electricity of TE material is represented by dimensionless
38 thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT). The ZT value is determined by the Seebeck coefficient (S), electrical conductivity
39 (s), absolute temperature (T), and thermal conductivity (<U+03BA>), and defined as: <U+0396><U+03A4>    sT/<U+03BA> . The thermal conductivity
40 includes contributions by two parts, the electron and the phonon. The ZT value can be improved by increasing the power
41 factor (PF    ) or decreasing thermal conductivity. The power factor can be improved by utilizing “band engineering”
42 to increase the effective mass and carrier concentration optimization [1-6]. The lattice thermal conductivity can be
43 decreased by utilizing some strategies to increase the scattering of phonon waves such as the introduction of lattice
imperfection [7] or nanoscale and mesoscale crystal structures [8-12]. Because of the dependent interrelation of the
44
Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity via carrier concentration and effective mass poses a great challenge to
45 regulating the thermal and electrical properties of thermoelectric material.
46 Ag-based ternary chalcopyrite semi-conductive materials have been widely studied regarding their potential
47 applications such as optoelectronic, nonlinear optical devices and photovoltaic solar cells, due to their suitable direct band
48 gap and large absorption coefficients [13-15]. The measured values of thermal conductivity for AgGaTe2 and AgInTe2 at
49 room temperature are 1.94 and 2.05 Wm-1K-1, respectively [16]. Their low thermal conductivities make AgGaTe2 and
50 AgInTe2 promising thermoelectric materials. The thermal properties of AgGaTe2 include Debye temperature entropy and
51 heat capacity under different pressure and have been calculated by Sharma et al. in 2014 [17]. The thermoelectric
52 transport characteristic depends not only on temperature, but also on carrier concentration. The thermoelectric transport
53 characteristic is needed to provide the reference doping carrier concentration for further experimental research and
54 promote the application of thermoelectric material. Peng et al. [18] and Parker et al. [19] have found that AgGaTe2 is a
55 promising thermoelectric material in p–type doping with a carrier concentration in the order of 1019–1020 cm-3. However,
they obtained the electrical conductivity with respect to relaxation time (s/t) using the Boltzmann transport theory based
56
on the electronic eigenvalues from GGA approximation, and have not obtained the ZT values of AgGaTe2.

Based on the self-consistent electronic eigenvalues calculated from first principle, the thermoelectric transport power
functions, S as well as s/t, can be straightforwardly obtained from Boltzmann transport theory without any adjustable
1 parameter. As well known, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) often significantly underestimate band gap. In
2 the case of AgGaTe2, The calculated band gap was only 0.075 eV within standard GGA [18], which is much smaller than
3 the experimental value (1.2 eV) [20]. On the other hand, GGA can’t successfully describe the silver 4d-electrons states
4 for the strong correlation [21]. So, to accurate and comprehensive analysis the thermoelectric transport properties of
5 AgGaTe2 and AgInTe2 from accurate electronic eigenvalues, we adopt GGA+U approach to overcome these issues. The
6 so-called GGA+U approach means including an intra-site Coulomb repulsion U-term by considering the strong exchange-
7 correlation to GGA. In addition, previous research has not taken into account variations in thermoelectric performance in
8 different crystallographic directions for AgGaTe2 and AgInTe2. This compels us to calculate in detail the thermoelectric
9 properties depending on the carrier concentration and temperature of AgGaTe2 and AgInTe2 in different crystallographic
10 directions using GGA+U approach.
11 This paper is organized as follows: the details of our calculational method and computational process are presented in
Section 2, and the results and a discussion on the electronic structures, phonon dispersion relations, and thermoelectric
12
transport properties are presented in Section 3. Section 4 is the conclusion.
13
14
15 3. Method of calculation
16 The structure optimization and electronic properties are performed in the form of the density-functional theory (DFT)
17 using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) code [22, 23] within generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
18 of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional form [24]. 4d105s1, 4s24p1, 5s25p1, and 5s25p4 are chosen as valence
19 electrons for the Ag, Ga, In and Te, respectively. To treat the strong correlation of Ag-4d electrons, the Hubbard-U
20 correction in Dudarev’s approach [25] is adopted. In Dudarev’s approach, the Coulomb and exchange interactions are
21 specified by the Ueff parameter. The value of Ueff= 4.5 eV are used for Ag-4d electrons from previous work on silver
oxide. [26]
22
A 7×7×7 k-mesh in primitive cell, centered at G, is chosen for integrations in the first Brillouin zone for the total
23
energy and density of states. The cutoff energy of the electron wave function set is 400 eV. The total energy convergence
24 and maximal force on each atom are lower than 1×10-6 eV and 5 meV/Å. The phonon transports have been investigated
25 using the Phonopy code [27] in the form of harmonic approximation. For the phonon spectrum calculations, a 2×2×2
26 supercell of the unit cell has been considered and the atomic displacement distance is set to 0.01Å. The BoltzTraP code
27 [28] has been employed to obtain the thermoelectric transport functions such as Seebeck coefficients (S) and electronic
28 conduction with respect to scattering time (s/t) using first principles data. This method is based on the Boltzmann
29 transport theory in the form of constant scattering time approximation (CSTA). To help obtain correct transport
30 properties, much denser k-mesh (19×19×19 in primitive cell) is used to ensure the accuracy of self-consistent energy
31 values. The relaxation time has been adjusted from existing experimental data to obtain the electronic conduction (s).

4. Results and discussion
The ternary chalcopyrite structure compound AgX(In,Ga)Te2 is crystallized in the tetragonal phase with space group
35 42d (no. 122). The crystal structure of AgX(In,Ga)Te2 is shown in Fig.1 using VESTA software [29]. There are four
36 formula unit atoms in each unit cell. Each Ag or In/Ga atom connects with four Te atoms to form a diamond-like
37 structure.
38 The optimized structural constants for AgInTe2 are a=b=6.56Å and c=12.65Å, which agree well with previously
39 reported experimental results of a=b=6.44Å, c=12.64Å [30] and theoretical values [31]. The optimal lattice constants
40 (a=b=6.39Å, c=11.82Å) for AgGaTe2 are in excellent agreement with experimental values within a 1% mismatch [32].
41 The Seebeck coefficient is directly proportional to the effective mass of carriers and slope of the density of states
42 (DOS) near the Fermi level. [33, 34] The chalcopyrite structure semiconductors have a direct band gap at the G point
43 [35-38]. The shape of the calculated band structures are similar to the previous DFT results expect band gap [39] and
44 thus no more plot in this paper. In this paper, we give insight into the effective masses of holes and electrons at the
45 valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM). The effective masses of holes and electrons at
   
46 the G point along different crystallographic directions have been calculated using: *    , where <U+210F>, E and k are the
 <U+210F> 
47 reduced Plank constant, energy eigenvalue and wave vector, respectively. The effective masses of holes and electrons for
48 AgX(In,Ga)Te2 along the a and c directions are listed in Table 1. The data from Table 1 indicate the effective masses of
49 holes and electrons for the chalcopyrite structure compound AgX(In,Ga)Te2 are anisotropic. We find the effective masses
50 of holes and electrons along the c direction are the same, while they are different along the a direction. In addition, we
51 noticed that the effective mass of holes is larger than the effective mass of electrons along the a direction. Hence, a large
52 Seebeck coefficient for p-type AgX(In,Ga)Te2 along the a direction is anticipate.
53 The partial and total DOS for AgX(In,Ga)Te2 are shown in Fig.2. From Fig.2, we can see that the calculated band gap
energies using GGA+U approach for AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2 are 0.99 eV and 1.04 eV, respectively. Our calculated results
54
agree well with previous experimental data [14, 20], which inspires confidence in the accuracy of our calculation.
55 Moreover, the Ag-4d and Te-5p states are the main contributors to VBM. The CBM is chiefly determined by the mixture
56 between Te-5p and In-5s or Ga-4s states. Meanwhile, as can be clearly seen from Fig.2, DOS near the edge of the valence
57 band is slightly steeper than that near the edge of the conduction band, which leads to a considerable p-type Seebeck
58 coefficient.
59 Now, we turn to the lattice dynamical properties of the chalcopyrite structure compound AgX(In,Ga)Te2. The lattice
60 dynamical properties are demonstrated in the form of harmonic approximation and supercell approach. We perform

2 2×2×2 supercell including 128 atoms and 0.01Å atomic displacement distance to calculate the electronic structure by
3 using VASP code. Based the calculated electronic structure data, the second-order force constants and phonon dispersion
4 relations are computed along high-symmetry points in the first Brillouin zone by Phonopy code [27]. The vibrational
5 spectrum curves together with the corresponding projected phonon DOS for AgX(In,Ga)Te2 are plotted in Fig.3.
6 As there are eight atoms in a primitive cell, the phonon dispersion curves involve 24 phonon modes. The positive
7 phonon frequencies suggest AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2 are dynamically stable. The phonon dispersion relations for AgInTe2
and AgGaTe2 are similar to each other. Both phonon dispersion relations of the two compounds have frequency gaps and
8
consist of two groups of bands. The high-frequency optical modes (up to 145cm-1 and 173 cm-1 respectively for AgInTe2
9 and AgGaTe2) are determined by the contributions of In/Ga and Te atoms. The low frequencies up to the frequency gap
10 are mixed by the Ag, Te and In/Ga atoms. Compared with flat optic phonon modes, highly dispersive acoustic phonon
11 modes have larger group velocities. Moreover, there are some low-frequency (below 50cm-1) optic phonon modes mixing
12 with acoustic phonon modes. The mixture of optic and acoustic phonon modes promotes the reduction of thermal
13 conductivity. We find that the phonon DOS of AgGaTe2 is a little wider than that of AgInTe2 in the low-frequency range
14 of up to 50 cm-1 and the Ga atom contributes to moving toward a lower frequency because of the lighter mass. In
15 addition, the minimum frequency of the optic mode for AgGaTe2 is 17.8 cm-1, while the frequency of the corresponding
16 mode for AgInTe2 is 22.7 cm-1, which suggests that AgGaTe2 has smaller thermal conductivity than AgInTe2. The
17 thermal conductivities for AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2 [16] yielded by experiments confirm what we had anticipated.
18 The Boltzmann transport theory in the form of CSTA can directly obtain Seebeck coefficients. The Seebeck
19 coefficients as a function of chemical potential for AgInTe2 at 300 K along the a and c directions are shown in Fig.4. The
Seebeck coefficients display anisotropy for the p-type AgInTe2 compound and show isotropy for the n-type one.
20
Additionally, the Seebeck coefficient for the p-type AgInTe2 in the a direction is larger than that in the c direction, which
21
mainly stems from the fact that the effective mass of holes in the a direction is significantly larger than that in the c
22 direction as mentioned above. Furthermore, the Seebeck coefficient of the p-type AgInTe2 along the c direction is larger
23 than that of the n-type one, due to the fact that DOS near VBM increases sharply with an energy decrease as indicated in
24 Fig.2(a).
25 In the form of CSTA, the electronic conduction s cannot be independently calculated directly from the electronic
26 structure by using the Boltzman transport theory. In order to obtain s, the information of the relaxation time t is needed.
27 We fit the theoretical total s/t with experimentally measured s at a fixed temperature and carrier concentration to
28 determine the behaviour of t. We take advantage of the experimental data (s = 2132.2 Sm-1, S = 390 µV/K) at 700K [40]
29 to fit the relaxation time. We use the average S and s/t along the a, b and c directions to compare with experimental
30 data, because the experimental data [40] is tested at arbitrary direction. The corresponding carrier concentration is
31 2.02×1019 cm-3 when the average S equals 390 µV/K at 700K. Our calculated s/t equals 9.15 × 10( Sm+ s + at the
32 same carrier concentration. Comparing calculated s/t with experimental s, we get the relaxation time at 700 K and
33 2.02×1019 cm-3 carrier concentration for the AgGaTe2. The fitted relaxation time at 700 K and 2.02×1019 cm-3 carrier
concentration for the AgGaTe2 compound is 2.33×10-15 s, which is a rational magnitude in semiconductors. Generally, t
34
decreases with an increase in temperature (T) and carrier concentration (n). We take the relaxation time t in the form of
35
t  AT + n+/. . The fitted constant A at 700 K and 2.02×1019 cm-3 carrier concentration for the AgGaTe2 compound is
36
A=4.44 × 10+/ . Thus, the relaxation time t as an expression of T and n for the AgGaTe2 compound is presented
37 as t  4.44 × 10+/ T + n+/. . The relaxation time t for the AgInTe2 compound is used the same approach as that of
38 AgGaTe2 because of their similar crystal structures.
39 We now discuss thermal conductivity. Thermal conductivity is contributed by both the electron and the phonon. The
40 lattice thermal conductivity is the main contributor (over 98%) and is determined mostly by the lattice structure [41]. We
41 assume the thermal conductivity only depends on temperature, which is widely used in thermoelectric materials [42, 43].
42 Thermal conductivity is adopted by fitting the experimentally measured data at different temperatures: k  A + 2, where

43 A and B are fitted constants. Fig.5 plots the temperature dependence of fitting thermal conductivity (solid lines) and the
44 experimentally measured data [16] (scattered dots) for AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2 compounds. The thermal conductivities for
45 AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2 compounds decrease greatly as the temperature increases. The temperature dependence of thermal
46 conductivity for AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2 compounds can be obtained by using the formulas k 
34.3/
- 0.61 and
47 34.78
2
48 k  2 - 0.77, respectively.
49 The calculated Seebeck coefficients and ZT values for AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2 compounds at different temperatures
50 with carrier concentration are given in Fig.6. The optimized ZT values of AgIn(Ga)Te2 compounds at different
51 temperature are listed in table 2. The Seebeck coefficients are sensitive to carrier concentration and temperature. The
52 bipolar effects are obvious both for AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2 at high temperatures and low carrier concentrations, which
53 result in the peaking of Seebeck coefficients at larger concentrations as the temperature rises from 300 K to 800 K. There
are two carrier concentrations, i.e., holes and electrons, in thermoelectric materials. Holes are the mostly carriers in p-type
54
thermoelectric material while electrons prevail as carriers in the n-type one. For p-type thermoelectric material, the
55 electronic concentration and electronic thermal excitation are obvious at low hole concentrations and high temperatures.
56 We discover the bipolar effect of AgInTe2 is a little more evident than that of AgGaTe2. The reason is that the smaller
57 band gap of AgInTe2 makes electronic thermal excitation a little easier than that of AgGaTe2.
58 As can be seen, the figure of merit ZT heavily depends on carrier concentration and temperature and the bipolar effects
59 are clearly visible. The bipolar effects cause the ZT at 800 K to be lower than the ZT at 700 K at low carrier
60 concentrations. The maximum ZT values for AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2 at 800 K are 0.91 and 1.38 at about 2.12×1020 cm-3

and 1.97×1020 cm-3 carrier concentrations, respectively. This indicates AgGaTe2 is a promising high-temperature
thermoelectric material for use in thermoelectric devices.

3 5. Conclusion
4 We have presented the electronic, vibrational and thermoelectric transport properties of AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2 in the
5 form of the first-principles theory. The electronic structures are obtained using the GGA+U approach and the results
6 agree well with existing experimental results. The calculated effective mass shows that AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2 are
7 possible p-type thermoelectric materials and thermoelectric properties are anisotropic in different crystallographic
8 directions. The results of vibrational transport properties calculated using harmonic approximation anticipate the low
9 thermal conductivity of AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2. Thermoelectric properties including Seebeck coefficients and figure of
merits for AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2 are obtained using the Boltzmann transport theory in the form of CSTA based on first-
10
principles electronic structures and previous experimental results. The bipolar effects at low doping levels and high
11 temperatures for AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2 are clearly visible and have a significant influence on the thermoelectric
12 properties. When we compare the thermoelectric properties between AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2, the ZT value of AgGaTe2 at
13 800 K is 1.38 at a doping level of about 1.97×1020 cm-3, which confirms AgGaTe2 is a potential thermoelectric material at
14 a high temperature.

Appendix B
Dear Editor,
Thanks for your letter on 14 August 2017 and the attached comments
from the referees.
I appreciate your favorite consideration and the referees’ insightful
comments on our manuscript. The advice from them is very useful for the
amendment to our paper and for our future research as well.
We have added ethics statement, acknowledgement at the end statement.
We have submitted data package to Dryad. We cited
“http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t10p2” in revised manuscript.
However this DOI link can be used after the manuscript is accepted. For
our manuscript (ID: RSOS-170750) is under review, the temporary
review link is:
“http://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.t10p2.”
If you have any question about this paper, please don't hesitate to let me
know.
Sincerely yours,
Qiang Fan
Response to referee 1:
We will reply to the referee’s comments point by point below.
[1] The Seebeck coefficient is directly proportional to slope of the density
of states (DOS) near the Fermi level. The steeper DOS leads to larger
Seebeck coefficient. The steeper DOS of the valence band indicates
AgX(In,Ga)Te2 may be possible p-type thermoelectric materials. We
also referenced related studies for our conclusion.
[2] Thanks for the referee supplied related references of the silver ion
material. We also cited those related studies in our work. As Yin et al.
(Yin Y, Chen G, Duan X, Ye H, Jin W, Zhu Y, Wu Y. 2016.
First-principles study on native point defects of cubic cuprite Ag2O. J.
Appl. Phys. 120, 215707.) have checked different U value, we
adopted the suitable value Ueff=4.5 eV.
[3] As the referee mentioned, “Now, we turn to the lattice dynamical
properties of the chalcopyrite structure compound AgX(In,Ga)Te2
----Based the calculated electronic structure data, the second-order
force constants and phonon dispersion relations are computed along
high-symmetry points in the first Brillouin zone by Phonopy code" is
calculation details. We adjusted those sentences to the “Method of
calculation” section.
[4] The calculated ZT value of AgGaTe2 at 800 K is 1.38, which is
considerable in nontoxic p-type thermoelectric material. The result
indicates AgGaTe2 is a potential thermoelectric material at high
temperature.
[5] Thanks for the referee’s advice of language and grammar. We have
checked the spelling and grammar mistake in the revised manuscript.
To avoid confusion, we divided the sentence “As can be seen, the
figure of merit ZT heavily depends on carrier concentration and
temperature and the bipolar effect are clearly visible.” into two
sentences as “As can be seen, the figure of merit ZT heavily depends
on carrier concentration and temperature. The bipolar effects are
clearly visible, which causes the ZT at 800 K to be lower than the ZT
at 700 K at low carrier concentrations.”
Response to referee 2:
Thanks for the referee’s constructive suggestions. We have studied the
comments carefully and responded to the comments in the following
three sections.
[1] For wording problem
As the referee mentioned, the PBE+U can better represent the
functional form used in calculation. We adjusted “GGA+U” to
“PBE+U”.
All word “band gap” in article was changed to “band-gap”.
[2] For grammar and spelling problem
In page 1, 46th line, ”regulating” was changed to “regulate”.
In page 2, 4th line, ”can’t” was changed to “cannot”.
The number in table 2 has been corrected for the spelling mistake.
[3] For confusing problem
The thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) is a dimensionless value,
which is used to represent the conversion efficiency between heat and
electricity of TE material. We reminded the related reference for the
definition.
Both the atomic positions and cell parameters are fully relaxed. To
avoid the confusion, we changed “The total energy convergence and
maximal force on each atom are lower than 1×10-6 eV and 5 meV/Å.”
to “The total energy convergence threshold on each atom is lower
than 1×10-6 eV. The maximal force on each ion is less than 5 meV/Å
for relaxation both atomic positions and cell parameters.”
The effective masses of holes and electrons at the G point along
different crystallographic directions have been calculated using the
equation in manuscript.
The effective masses of holes and electrons for AgX(In,Ga)Te2
along the a direction can be obtained from the VBM and CBM of
band structure along S (-0.25, 0.25, 0.25)-G(0, 0, 0)-S (-0.25, 0.25,
0.25) path.
The effective masses of holes and electrons for AgX(In,Ga)Te2
along the c direction can be obtained from the VBM and CBM of
band structure along Z (0.5, 0.5, -0.5)-G(0, 0, 0)-Z (0.5, 0.5, -0.5)
path.
