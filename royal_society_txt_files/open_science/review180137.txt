The manuscript by D. Q. Liu, et al. has reported the fabrication of PCL nanofiber loaded with an
anti-tumor drug PPD, the authors have conducted systematic characterization of the obtained
composited nanofiber using a range of different techniques and evaluated the drug release
kinetics, biocompatibility as well as in-vitro antitumor activity. It seems that the reported
conclusions are supported by the experimental results, but the present article has an obvious
limitation in terms of reason for using nanofiber as drug carrier. Because normally the large
variety of nanospheres, micelles, vesicles, capsules made from synthetic polymer or
biomacromolecules are used in controlled release and delivery of drugs, and a large amount of
the “smart” response vehicles have already been reported for such purposes. Therefore, I think
the motivation of using nanofiber as drug carrier is not convinced by the experimental results in
current work, for this reason I cannot recommend the publication of current manuscript unless
the authors have provided stronger evidence to prove the advantage of the developed nanofiber
over the classical self-assembled nanostructures.

Responses to reviewers’ comments
We sincerely thank the reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions. Below
we have provided responses to the comments and have accordingly revised the
manuscript.
Reviewer: 1
The large variety of nanospheres, micelles, vesicles, capsules made from
synthetic polymer or biomacromolecules are used in controlled release and delivery of
drugs, and a large amount of the “smart” response vehicles have already been
reported for such purposes. Therefore, the motivation of using nanofiber as drug
carrier is not convinced by the experimental results in current work.
Response:
Thanks for the reviewer’s valuable comments. Electrospun nanofiber have unique
properties such as increased surface-area-to-volume ratio, which makes them a good
candidate for drug delivery (MS-Page 2, References 21, 22). To further support our
study, we have added two more references in the text(MS-Page 2, References 23,
24).These articles further illustrates the unique advantages of nanofiber membranes as
drug carriers. To future confirmed the antitumor effect of drug-loaded nanofibrous
membranes, in vivo experiments has been carried out. All of the BALB/c nude mice
were subcutaneously inoculated with Hep-2 cells (1×107 cells/ml medium, 100 µl per
mouse) in the right axillae on day 0. Approximately 15 days after inoculation,
xenografts in the BALB/c nude mice were reached a volume of approximately 60
mm3(labeled as day 0). Then all the mice were randomized into four groups (n=5) and
numbered: control group, pure PPD group, PCL/PPD nanofiber group, PCL nanofiber
group. After the preparation was completed, PBS were injected in the mice every 2
days for control group. For PPD group, the mice were injected with PPD (20 mg/kg)
every 2 days for a total of 3 times. Meanwhile, the PCL/PPD and PCL nanofiber
groups were implanted subcutaneously near the tumors. The PPD group and
PCL/PPD nanofiber group contained the same amount of PPD (20 mg/kg). The size of
tumours in all mice were measured every 3 days. At day 9, the mice were sacrificed.
Then, the tumors were removed and weighted. As shown in figure S1, the mean tumor
volume of PPD group and PCL/PPD nanofiber group are smaller than that of control
group and PCL group. Although there was no significant difference in tumor volume
between the drug-loaded nanofiber group and drug group, the only once implantation
of nanofiber group has displayed a comparable tumor growth suppression compared
with the three times injection of PPD group after 9 days of treatment. Therefore, the
in vivo antitumor experiment demonstrated that the drug-loaded nanofibers evidently
minimized administration frequency and drug dosage, which gives it a great
advantage as drug carrier.

Responses to reviewers’ comments
We sincerely thank the reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions. Below
we have provided responses to the comments and have accordingly revised the
manuscript.
Reviewer:1
The authors have conducted in-vivo studies of the developped nanofiber, which provides
the solid proof for the effectivenss of the PCL nanofiber system. So I think the current
manuscript can be accepted for publication.
Response:
We greatly appreciated the reviewer’s comments on our manuscript.
Reviewer: 2
1. In the introduction part, it is suggested for the authors to add a few references
related to the electrospinning technique, for instance, Carbon 2012, 50, 5605;
JMCB 2017, 5, 1699.
Response:
Thanks for the reviewer’s valuable comments. We have added the reference in the
following paragraph.
“These fibers are generated by electrostatic repulsion and the Coulomb force due to an
external electric field applied to a polymer solution or melt. A polymer jet is created by
applying a critical potential between the metallic needle and a grounded collector, and
the fabricated nonafibers can be collected at the collecting device[12].”
“Electrospun nanofibers have been extensively used in many fields, such as energy-
related applications [13], tissue engineering scaffolds [14,15], wound dressings [16],
vascular grafts [17,18], drug delivery [19-21] , biosensor applications[22] and so on.”

Response:
Thanks for pointing out this. We have corrected the full name of "PCL" in the text.
Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a semi-crystalline, environmental friendly, biodegradable
and biodegradable compatible polymer which has been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in the USA for biomedical uses [27].
3. In Figure 2, the front size of scale bars is too small to see.
Response:
Thanks for the reviewer’s valuable comments. We have already increased the front size
of scale bars in figure 2.
4. In Figure 7, it is suggested to add error bars for the data points.
Response:
We greatly appreciated the reviewer’s comments. We have added error bars for the data
points in figure 7.
5. It is suggested for the authors to discuss on the advantages of their PCL/PPD
nanofibers for drug delivery in more details.
Response:
We greatly appreciated the reviewer’s valuable comments. To further support our study,
the advantages of PCL/PPD nanofibers for drug delivery have been discussed in more
detail. We have added the text as shown in the below: “This can be ascribed to some
reasons. On the one hand, the drug-loaded nanofiber membrane could be implanted at
the tumor site directly. The drug could be released near the site of the lesion in need of
treatment, thereby reducing the drug loss, improving the bioavailability of the drug and
effectively avoiding systemic side effects caused by systemic administration. On the
other hand, the drug could be released from the drug-loaded nonafibers in a sustained
way, ensuring therapeutic drug levels at the tumor site for an extended period. The drug
release characteristics could reduce the number of administrations, avoid fluctuations
in drug concentrations that occur during repeated administration, reduce side effects
and patient suffering.”
