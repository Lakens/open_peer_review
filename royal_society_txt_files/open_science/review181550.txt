This paper provides numerical results from the analysis of pipes pulled horizontally through
sand. The flow in the manuscript is weak in places and important information required in a
paper focusing on modeling is missing. There is a disproportionate emphasis at the beginning on
the experimental programme that had been carried out previously and published elsewhere.
Given the large end displacements, up to 30 mm, progressive failure would be expected, which
cannot be properly accommodated by the constitutive model. Some specifics include:
1. The English must be improved. In some places it is awkward, there are spelling mistakes and
inappropriate words or grammatical tense are used. Take for example, the third sentence in the
introduction. Soil instability may be considered a soil failure but soil creep is a mechanism. Also
referring to 5 lines down from the top of page 2 the word focused should probably be replaced by
focusing. On page 2, line 30: analyses is spelt incorrectly.
2. Figure 9 appears to be referred to before Figure 8.
3. It is clear from the introduction that the paper focuses on analysis, yet section 2 provides a
disproportionate amount of information on the “Testing Program”. From a numerical analysis
point of view, it would have been sufficient to show the basic layout of the test being analyzed
(not the facility) and the properties of the soil, including a figure of a typical stress-strain
response of the sand. Had the sand been dense, it would probably have undergone post-peak
softening that would have included shear banding. For such a case a constant dilation angle
would have been inappropriate and local progressive failure would have taken place before the
peak load would have been reached that reflects a macro-scale measure. The reviewer is aware
that only the behavior up to peak was of interest.
4. The reviewer appreciates that a commercial code was used and that low-order elements are
favoured for problems involving contact and large displacements. Were the stress and strain rate
measures objective? Also, the 3-D 8-node element is known to have problems if bending modes
are present, say adjacent to the pipe. Was selective (not reduced) integration used to improve the
performance of the 8-node element?
5. Page 6, line 58: What does the quadrilateral element response have to do with the triangular
element response? In section 4.2 it was made clear that the 2-D, 6-node triangular element was
used. There are ways of predicting softer responses with 3-node triangular elements.
6. Page 7, Line 39: Should likely be referring to Figure 12 not 11.
7. Section 5.5: Just because ASCE charts go up to a friction angle of 45, is not a good reason to use
the residual strength for carrying out the analysis.

This paper presents experimental data and numerical simulations of tests investigating the
behavior of buried steel pipelines subjected to lateral earth movement. The presented
experimental data are useful for understanding pipeline behavior and for future numerical model
calibration by other researchers. The presented numerical modeling, including the Janbu
expression for the elastic modulus distribution with depth, is based on rather simple, standard
procedures. The conclusions derived from the comparisons of the experimental measurements
and the numerical results seem to be reasonable. Therefore, this reviewer recommends
publication of the article.

The paper needs substantial improvement in terms of writing, analysis and presentation before
publishing. Some points to consider are as below. Subroutine incorporated modelling shows
improvement in prediction of pipe response. But, the paper needs improvement by highlighting
the its main contribution and significance.
• Please highlight the significance of research work (such as need of incorporating stress
dependent E value)
• Line 46 p.1; it would be appropriate to use third person language in the manuscript
• Line 35 p.2: Please add more description of the tests; such as soil condition, soil type, etc
• Line 18 page4; cohesion of 1kpa can be excessive for dry sand. Please verify the selection
• Line 21 page4; please provide reference for dilation angle use
• Fig.5; large mesh sensitivity can be observed. Please define the mesh size in fine, medium and
coarse mesh. Also, provide number of elements in each approach
• Section 4.5; please compare the model prediction of load-displacement curve with the
experiments
• Please also compare peak load/(soil unit weight x height x diameter x length) as the guidelines
are based on this scale
• Results and discussion section has not been written well. It needs improvement in terms of
presentation and rigorous analysis.
• Would pipe pulling load same as pipe lateral load?
• It is clear from literature that plane strain and structured elements are the most suitable element
type for this problem (lateral pipeline analysis). I am not sure why authors want to present this
parametric study on element types? It appears not significant to present in the paper
• Why there is a substantial difference between tests and 3-D numerical model predictions in Fig
14
• Even with Janbu’s incorporation, there is substantial difference in peak load and mobilization
in Fig. 17. Please discuss
• It would be useful to propose analytical model for bending moment based on the numerical
predictions using janbu’s stress dependent formulation

Appendix A
1 Reviewer-1
2 1. Comments to the Author(s)
3 This paper provides numerical results from the analysis of pipes pulled horizontally through sand. The
4 flow in the manuscript is weak in places and important information required in a paper focusing on
5 modeling is missing. There is a disproportionate emphasis at the beginning on the experimental
6 programme that had been carried out previously and published elsewhere. Given the large end
7 displacements, up to 30 mm, progressive failure would be expected, which cannot be properly
8 accommodated by the constitutive model. Some specifics include:
9 The English must be improved. In some places it is awkward, there are spelling mistakes and
10 inappropriate words or grammatical tense are used. Take for example, the third sentence in the
11 introduction. “Soil instability may be considered a soil failure but soil creep is a mechanism”.
12
13 ** Thank you for taking the time to review this manuscript. It is very much
14 appreciated!
15
16 Authors have reviewed the first three sentences of the introduction (shown
17 below) and could not find the incorrect sentence that is being referred to
18 in the comment. A comprehensive review of the manuscript has been conducted
19 and many improvements have been introduced to the manuscript in general.
20
21 “Oil and gas transmission lines can cross zones of soil instability and may need to be
22 designed to resist differential ground movements. Soil instabilities can result from natural
23 phenomena such as soil creep, slope failures, landslides, and earthquake-induced faults.
24 Other man-made activities can lead to lateral soil movements against pipes such as
25 excavation, tunneling, directional drilling, and pipe bursting”
26
27 2. Also referring to 5 lines down from the top of page 2 the word focused should probably be replaced by
28 focusing.
29 ** “focused” has been changed to “focusing”.
30
31
32 3. On page 2, line 30: analyses is spelt incorrectly.
33 ** Authors used the plural form of the word not the singular in referral to
34 a class of 3D-FEA analyses that are often encountered when using lower-
35 order elements. Upon further review and considering the reviewer’s feedback
36 on the readability of the sentence, the word has now changed to the
37 singular form “analysis”.
38
39 4. Figure 9 appears to be referred to before Figure 8.
40 ** The reason is that Figure 9 is the first figure where the method of
41 determining the pipe displacement at peak pulling load, Yu, could be
42 illustrated. Also, it was necessary to present the concept of Pu-Yu relation
43 before discussing Figure 8. To clear up any confusion this may cause to the
44 reader,the sentence has been modified as follows (Lines 266-267):
45
46 “An illustration of how peak pulling force Pu values corresponding to Yu,e are extracted
47 from three different numerical analyses appears in a subsequent figure (Figure 9), for
48 embedment ratio of H/D=3.”
49
50 5. It is clear from the introduction that the paper focuses on analysis, yet section 2 provides a
51 disproportionate amount of information on the “Testing Program”. From a numerical analysis
52 point of view, it would have been sufficient to show the basic layout of the test being
53 analyzed (not the facility) and the properties of the soil, including a figure of a typical stress-
54 strain response of the sand.
55 ** The ”Testing Facility” sub-section has been removed and the “Testing
56 Program” section has been rewritten to provide a more concise description
57 of the experimental work. Also, in addition to the experimental data (Load-
58 Displacement curve) that depict the stress-strain behaviour of dense sand,
59 a reference for additional details of the soil characterization tests
60 including grain size analysis, and triaxial tests have been included in
61 this section. It reads (Line 59):
62
63 “Details of the soil characterization tests including grain size analysis, and triaxial tests are
64 discussed by Almahakeri [25].”
65
66 6. Had the sand been dense, it would probably have undergone post-peak softening that would
67 have included shear banding. For such a case a constant dilation angle would have been
68 inappropriate and local progressive failure would have taken place before the peak load
69 would have been reached that reflects a macro-scale measure. The reviewer is aware that
70 only the behavior up to peak was of interest.
71
72 ** Authors do agree with the reviewer’s comment on dense sand behavior.As
73 one of the main objectives of the current study (stated in Lines 40-41) is
74 to develop a simple3D modeling technique to estimate the load-deflection
75 response of pipes moving laterally through the ground, based on independent
76 parameters for the pipe and soil. This is achieved by describing a simple
77 stress-dependent soil modulus -up to peak loading- using a built-in
78 “utility” subroutine (by employing the Janbu model) and comparing it
79 against different experimental results.
80 Other, more sophisticated, full material user-defined, subroutines are more
81 robust, but often not available in the public domain. The model presented
82 in the current study, which has been verified against different
83 experimental results can be of direct benefit to both researchers and
84 industry practitioners alike.
85 Authors can reflect this idea in the text if deemed necessary.
86
87 7. The reviewer appreciates that a commercial code was used and that low-order elements are
88 favoured for problems involving contact and large displacements. Were the stress and strain
89 rate measures objective? Also, the 3-D 8-node element is known to have problems if
90 bending modes are present, say adjacent to the pipe. Was selective (not reduced) integration
91 used to improve the performance of the 8-node element?
92
93 ** ABAQUS software does incorporate the use of “selective Integration”
94 formulation for its 8-noded linear hexahedral elements (C3D8)formulation.
95
96 8. Page 6, line 58: What does the quadrilateral element response have to do with the triangular
97 element response? In section 4.2 it was made clear that the 2-D, 6-node triangular element
98 was used. There are ways of predicting softer responses with 3-node triangular elements.
99
100 ** Upon review, the two sentences relevant to the quadrilateral elements
101 behavior and the reference to the work by Sloan (1983) does not apply to
102 the work presented in this manuscript since all 2D analyses have been
103 executed using the triangle elements (as indicated in section 4.2). While
104 attempts of using quadrilateral elements were made (discussed briefly in
105 the original submission-section 4.2, Lines 168-169), no detailed results
106 were reported. Hence, the following two sentences have been removed from
107 the manuscript.
108
109 “Sloan [36] explains that quadrilateral elements are known to be over stiff when used with
110 full integration, and that oscillations can arise when using reduced integration to counter
111 those problems. Sloan indicates that this influences both drained behavior (where there is
112 frictional behaviour and volume change) and undrained analysis (where friction angle is
113 zero and volume change should be zero”
114
115
116 9. Page 7, Line 39: Should likely be referring to Figure 12 not 11.
117 ** Corrected.
118
11910. Section 5.5: Just because ASCE charts go up to a friction angle of 45, is not a good reason to
120 use the residual strength for carrying out the analysis.
121
122 ** The reason ASCE soil capacity limits were calculated based on the constant
123 volume friction angle (<U+F066>resid = 45o) instead of peak friction angle (<U+F066>p = 53o) is
124 to ensure direct comparison between the two methods. As no peak loads could
125 be extracted from ASCE guidelines for critical friction angle of 53o, authors
126 compared the ASCE using <U+F066>resid with the residual strength of the soil –not the
127 peak load- as shown in Figure 14.
128
129 A clarification has been introduced in the text as follows (Lines 382-384):
130
131 “In order to ensure direct comparison between the two methods, the ASCE guidelines
132 residual strength estimations were compared to the residual strength of the soil as
133 illustrated in Figure 14.”

142 This paper presents experimental data and numerical simulations of tests investigating the
143 behavior of buried steel pipelines subjected to lateral earth movement. The presented
144 experimental data are useful for understanding pipeline behavior and for future numerical
145 model calibration by other researchers. The presented numerical modeling, including the Janbu
146 expression for the elastic modulus distribution with depth, is based on rather simple, standard
147 procedures. The conclusions derived from the comparisons of the experimental measurements
148 and the numerical results seem to be reasonable. Therefore, this reviewer recommends
149 publication of the article.

168 Comments to the Author(s)
169 The paper needs substantial improvement in terms of writing, analysis and presentation before
170 publishing. Some points to consider are as below. Subroutine incorporated modelling shows
171 improvement in prediction of pipe response. But, the paper needs improvement by
172 highlighting the its main contribution and significance.
173 ** Thank you for taking the time to review this manuscript. It is very much
174 appreciated!
175
176 1. Please highlight the significance of research work (such as need of incorporating stress
177 dependent E value)
178 *** An introductory sentence has been added at the start of the literature
179 review section (Line 1,third paragraph) and another one at the end of the
180 section (Line 19)to highlight the significance and focus of the current study
181 on the use of stress-dependant model to the soil stress-strain relation. Both
182 sentences are shown below:
183 “In pipe-soil interaction problems, it is known that the soil stress-strain relation governs the
184 restraint loads imposed on the pipeline. Over the years, many models have been developed to
185 capture the influence of different parameters of the soil.
186 . . Section on literature review goes here . .
187 In the present study, simple 2D and 3D finite element models employing stress-dependent
188 stiffness of the soil using Janbu model subroutine are presented and discussed.”
189
190
191 2. Line 46 p.1; it would be appropriate to use third person language in the manuscript
192 *** Three relative pronouns (“who”) were identified and removed from the
193 text.
194
195
196 3. Line 35 p.2: Please add more description of the tests; such as soil condition, soil type, etc
197 *** In consideration for Reviewer #1 suggestion to keep some appropriation of
198 the size of the description of the experimental work (by reducing it) and to
199 address the current comment, authors have cited an additional reference for
200 readers to get more details about the testing program. Additionally, basic
201 soil conditions and parameters (dry Olivine dense sand, with friction angle,
202 dilation angle, density, and modulus of elasticity distribution) have been
203 reported in the manuscript. Authors can provide any other specific
204 information related to the soil related to the study.
205
206 4. Line 18 page4; cohesion of 1kpa can be excessive for dry sand. Please verify the selection
207
208 *** Additional verification of the choice has been included in the text. New
209 sentence now reads (Lines 142-144):
210
211 For cohesion, c, since the Mohr–Coulomb model implemented in ABAQUS requires nonzero
212 cohesion to accommodate the shape of flow potential close to the apex of the model, a
213 minimum value of 1 kPa was employed even though the test sand was dry. This artificial
214 cohesion was introduced to ensure the soil had a small but non-zero strength when in a state
215 of zero confining stress. This is a common requirement reported in many other studies
216 [3,30,31].
217
218
219 5. Line 21 page4; please provide reference for dilation angle use
220
221 *** Reference has been added to text.
222
223 6. Fig.5; large mesh sensitivity can be observed. Please define the mesh size in fine, medium and
224 coarse mesh. Also, provide number of elements in each approach
225 *** Additional information has been added to indicate the element size (Line
226 189), and node seeding approach used in the finite element models [Line 183].
227 Also, additional figures (Figure 4a,b,c,d,e, and f) showing the different
228 meshes used for the analyses (2D &3D) along with the corresponding number of
229 nodes and elements have been added.
230
231 7. Section 4.5; please compare the model prediction of load-displacement curve with the
232 experiments
233 *** Authors reviewed section 4.5 and there was no mention about load-
234 displacement curves. The section primarily discusses the method used to
235 define pipe displacement at peak pulling load (Yu). If the comment is
236 regarding Yu, both Figure 6 and Figure 7 include comparison with the
237 experiments. For load-displacement curves, Figures 9, 11, 13, and 14 compare
238 the different model calculations to the experimental results.
239
240 8. Please also compare peak load/(soil unit weight x height x diameter x length) as the guidelines
241 are based on this scale
242 *** Authors reported peak loads (per unit length of the pipe) to maintain
243 consistency with the other load-displacement figures in the manuscript. A
244 clarification has been included in the text to indicate that load-
245 displacement curves in Figure 14(experimental and numerical) are compared to
246 corresponding values (i.e., pulling load/unit length) using the ASCE (1984)
247 guidelines. New text now reads (Lines 379-380):
248
249 “Measured and calculated values for Pu reported in this study are now compared with the
250 corresponding values using ASCE guidelines [20] based on the work of Trautmann and
251 O’Rourke [22]”
252
253 9. Results and discussion section has not been written well. It needs improvement in terms of
254 presentation and rigorous analysis.
255
256 Authors assume that the revised manuscript has now sufficient analysis and
257 clarification.
258
259 10. Would pipe pulling load same as pipe lateral load?
260 Yes, it is the same load as pulling displacement was applied at the pipe end
261 nodes (where reaction forces were calculated). A clarification has been added
262 to the text. Lines (229-230) now read:
263 “The calculated pulling load on the pipe was extracted from the reaction forces of the pipe
264 end nodes where prescribed displacement was applied.”
265
266
267 11. It is clear from literature that plane strain and structured elements are the most suitable
268 element type for this problem (lateral pipeline analysis). I am not sure why authors want to
269 present this parametric study on element types? It appears not significant to present in the
270 paper
271
272 *** Plane strain elements have been used in the current study as indicated in
273 section 5.2 (Line 166). The use of the automatic built-in mesh generation of
274 the software was employed as the structured mesh configuration encountered
275 numerical instability for the CPE6M elements. However, there was a negligible
276 difference between the two different mesh configurations over the completed
277 part of the anslysis. The above comment has been addressed in the text. Lines
278 (185-187) now read:
279
280 “The automatic built-in mesh generation of the software was employed as structured mesh
281 configuration encountered numerical instability for the CPE6M elements (analysis aborted at
282 10.3% of completion. Comparison of the load-displacement curve between the two mesh
283 configurations over the completed part of the analysis showed almost identical behavior.”
284
285 12. Why there is a substantial difference between tests and 3-D numerical model predictions in Fig
286 14
287 The explanation was provided in the original manuscript (now lines 371-376)
288
289 13. Even with Janbu’s incorporation, there is substantial difference in peak load and mobilization in
290 Fig. 17. Please discuss
291 Figure 17 is the comparison between the calculated load-displacement curve
292 using Janbu model and the one using uniform soil modulus. The Janbu model
293 curve (shown in Figure 17) was first introduced and discussed in an earlier
294 section. It was also compared to experimental data (Figure 9). It is worth
295 noting also that peak loading was determined using the Yu discussed in
296 section 4.5. and hence, Janbu model showed very good agreement at the burial
297 test illustrated in Figure 17.
298
299 14. It would be useful to propose analytical model for bending moment based on the numerical
300 predictions using janbu’s stress dependent formulation
301 Thank you for the suggestion. This definitely is an excellent topic for
302 future work authors can explore in future work.
