General:
Using playback techniques the present study investigates long distance communication between
polygynous males of the Houbara Bustard displaying on so-called exploded leks. The study first
investigates changes in amplitude and frequency content of the very low frequency signals,
‘booms’, during propagation through the environment around the clock and identifies robust
signal parameters. It then convincingly demonstrates that vocal communication between these
birds may work reliably up to more than impressive 600 m in general and during late night and
early mornings even up to more than 1 km using these robust parameters. Visual cues may
modify the males’ responses but are of minor importance relative to the vocal signals. The study
thus supports the so-called ‘acoustic adaptation hypothesis’ with an extreme example. The
experimental design is clear and logical, the data acquisition, analysis and conclusions adequate,
so I only have minor comments and questions.
Minor comments:
Ad line 50: You may consider also including in the list of general references to sound
transmission: ‘Attenborough K. 2007 Sound propagation in the atmosphere. In: TD Rossing, ed.
Springer Handbook of Acoustics. Springer: NY pp. 113-147’
Ad line 52: Please consider including in the list of references (here and perhaps elsewhere):
‘Jensen KK, Larsen ON, Attenborough K. 2008 Measurements and predictions of hooded crow
(Corvus corone cornix) call propagation over open field habitats. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 123(1), 507-
518. (doi: 10.1121/1.2817363)’ as this paper investigates signal transmission over long distances of
another bird species with relatively low frequency signals.
Ad 128-130: Please specify whether the propagation and playback experiments were all
performed exclusively on the ‘reg’ plains. Perhaps you could also give the reader an impression
of the environment by statements such as ‘scrubs less than 1 m high and typically spaced by 50
m’ – or whatever is appropriate.
Ad line 140: Please change ‘Gras’ to ‘G.R.A.S.’ as the latter is the proper company name, which
the reader could recognize and use.
Ad lines 143-144: Please state if the eight distances were measured along just one line transect or
if the distances were taken at different locations with different compass orientations of the
speaker-to-microphone direction.
Ad line 166 and line 880: Please state clearly in line 166 (as you do in line 880) that the weather
station was positioned a little less than 50 km away from the study site. How can you be certain
that temperatures, humidities, and wind velocities measured about 50 km away do also apply to
the study site? Was the location of the weather station at the same altitudes (800-1700 a.s.l.) as Al
Baten? Did you make any controls (i.e. using a hand held thermometer to correlate with the
weather station)? Please clarify.
Ad line 172: I do not understand why you define ‘good weather conditions’ as ‘wind speeds less
than 4.17 m.s-1’. In lines 149-150, however, ‘Good weather conditions’ are defined as ‘windy and
rainy days were avoided’. A wording like ‘… under good wind conditions, i.e. with a wind
velocity of less than 4 m/s’ seems more appropriate to me – unless there is a hidden message in
the very precise number that I did not catch.
Lines 184-186: How site specific are the males? Can you be absolutely certain that no male was
subjected to both playback experiment 1 and 2 over the years 2012 and 2013?
Line 199: Please change ‘Avisfot’ to ‘Avisoft’.
Line 237: In order to relate the transmission studies to the playback studies you must state, when
(in what time period) the playback experiments were actually performed (afternoon, dusk or
dawn – I presume that the visual stimuli were never used during the night when it would be
pitch dark). Or did I overlook this information? Please clarify.
Lines 238-239: How did you measure the distances between speaker and target display site to
obtain precise distances on the cm-scale? I find the figures surprisingly precise; ‘175 +/- 56 m’
would seem more reasonable. Please clarify.
Line 248: Please change ‘show’ to ‘showed’.
3
Lines 249-250: To help the reader you should describe the normal reaction of the lekking male (i.e.
if it stopped displaying and ran towards the speaker, how far from the speaker it stopped etc.) as
most readers will not take time to consult [51].
Lines 262-264: How did you perform these measurements? You hardly used a tape measure after
each playback as this would have disturbed the birds. Also in Online Resource 2 I am not sure
what the numbers under the heading ‘Distance to the playback set-up’ signify as they are without
unit (in contrast to all other data in the table) and all <1 but measured with three significant
digits. Please clarify.
Lines 312-313: I suggest you use the past tense (i.e. ‘varied’ and ‘decreased’)
Lines 395-396: Here you may consider referring to Jensen et al (2008) – see ‘Ad line 52’ above.
Ad Fig. 2: Please consider including a meter scale on the figure such that the reader can
appreciate the large dimensions of the speaker.
Ad Table 1, line 875: Please consider including below ‘Afternoon; Dusk; Night; Dawn’ the actual
time periods, i.e. ‘14:20-15:38; 17:33-18:38; etc.’ as this will help the reader of only figures and
tables to quickly get an overview.
Ad Table 2, line 883: Please consider changing the order of time periods in the table to ‘Afternoon
– Dusk – Night – Dawn’ as then the opposite developments of temperature and humidity and the
dial changes in wind velocity are more easily observed. Also consider changing ‘(dB)’ to ‘(dB re
20 µPa)’

This paper investigates the vocal communication in a species with an exploded lek mating system
and using low frequency sounds, the houbara bustard. It presents data from a propagation
experiment that illustrates very nicely how birds adapt their behaviour to the constraints of the
environment (displaying at dawn and by night when the transmission is optimal) and also 3
playback experiments. Two of them reveal the vocal cues taken into account during agonistic
encounters, adding information to a previous paper from the same authors. The third experiment
4
investigates the relative roles of visual and acoustic cues. As a whole this gives a complete
overview of the intra-sexual communication of this species with an interesting mating system and
is in my view a highly valuable contribution to the scientific literature. I have several minor
comments that the authors should be able to easily address.
I have one main interrogation concerning the playback 3, involving acoustic and visual cues,
presented either separately or combined. Given the distance between the displaying bird and the
dummy (line 239, on average 175m) it is not obvious when reading the manuscript to understand
if the male was aware of the visual presentation of the dummy, especially when it was presented
alone. Authors specify in the discussion that “in response to the visual signal alone, males
remained at a distance from the stuffed male” and from the results it appears that they didn’t
modify the distance towards the dummy (the ration between the initial distance / the minimal
(maximal) distance male -loudspeaker after the broadcast is 0.99. When both the acoustic and
visual signals were presented the birds may have detected the dummy while responding to the
playback but when the dummy was presented alone, especially if this was the first stimulus
presented, how were authors sure that the focal male detected its presence ? Did the birds look or
direct themselves while displaying towards the dummy ?
Were there any order effects for this experiment ? One may expect a stronger response to the
visual stimulus alone when it was presented in the 2nd or 3rd position vs when it was presented
in the first position. Authors should maybe reformulate the sentence line 496 “Even though visual
signaling appeared not necessary in the context of intra-sexual competition” while trying to get
this clearer to the reader. Does the low response in the visual condition reflect a low importance
of the visual cue or an inability to correctly detect the signal in the current set-up ? Also, given the
big distances between the displaying males, do they come closer to each other at some moments?
Is the visibility at dawn good enough for birds to take into account visual cues at distances up to
550 m (average distance between two displaying sites) ? Maybe the visual signal is taken into
account only during close interactions. This would be interesting to be mentioned / discussed.
The distance is expressed as the ratio “initial distance male-loudspeaker / minimal (male
approach) or maximal (male runaway) distance male-loudspeaker after the broadcast. If I
understood correctly, the ratio should be > 1 when the males are approaching the loudspeaker
and < 1 when they run away from the loudspeaker. While all the mean values (Online Resource
2) are negative, suggesting the males run away from the loudspeaker, in the discussion of the
experiment 3 it appears that the males approached the loudspeaker during the acoustic treatment
(line 489). Or the mean value for the Acoustic condition in experiment 3 is 0.566. This should not
be greater than 1 ? Can the authors make clear this point?
The authors mention “complete courtship sequences” (lines 249-250). Lines 101-104 - do all the
displays have both a visual (running) and an acoustic (booming) phase or are there equally
incomplete displays (visual only or acoustic only)? Do the authors have data about it? This may
add to the relevance of the experiment 3.
Lines 184-185 - were the birds colour-ringed? If not, how did the authors know they were
different birds ? Big enough distance between sites..?
Lines 204-207 - authors should rather mention here the natural length of a booming session
(mentioned further on in the discussion, line 466), this would make it clearer for the reader why
they chose 5 and 10 booms for the playback experiment.
Line 226 - concerning the bird used as a visual lure, as it was born in captivity, it would be useful
to give the age (when it died) and the size of the individual and explain how it situates relative to
the natural range of the species.
Line 262 - how were distances estimated ?
Lines 333 - I suggest authors could use the whole name of the condition instead of WFM and
2ndH signal, this would make it clearer for the reader

We are very pleased to submit a revised version of our MS RSOS-170594 entitled "Booming far: the
ong-range vocal strategy of a lekking bird”.
We are very grateful to the referees for their comments and suggestions and took all of them into
account. How we dealt with them is explained below.
Sincerely yours,
Clément Cornec, Yves Hingrat, Thierry Aubin & Fanny Rybak

1/ Ad line 50: You may consider also including in the list of general references to sound transmission:
Attenborough K. 2007 Sound propagation in the atmosphere. In: TD Rossing, ed. Springer Handbook
of Acoustics. Springer: NY pp. 113-147’
Done
2/ Ad line 52: Please consider including in the list of references (here and perhaps elsewhere): ‘Jensen
KK, Larsen ON, Attenborough K. 2008 Measurements and predictions of hooded crow (Corvus corone
cornix) call propagation over open field habitats. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 123(1), 507-518. (doi:
10.1121/1.2817363)’ as this paper investigates signal transmission over long distances of another bird
pecies with relatively low frequency signals.
Done
3/ Ad 128-130: Please specify whether the propagation and playback experiments were all performed
exclusively on the ‘reg’ plains. Perhaps you could also give the reader an impression of the environment
by statements such as ‘scrubs less than 1 m high and typically spaced by 50 m’ – or whatever is
appropriate.
We added, following Hingrat et al (2008) a sentence describing more naturistically what reg plains look
ike. (line 128-132)
4/ Ad line 140: Please change ‘Gras’ to ‘G.R.A.S.’ as the latter is the proper company name, which the
eader could recognize and use.
Done
5/ Ad lines 143-144: Please state if the eight distances were measured along just one line transect or
f the distances were taken at different locations with different compass orientations of the speaker-
o-microphone direction.
The distances were indeed along a one line transect which is now specified in the text.
6/ Ad line 166 and line 880: Please state clearly in line 166 (as you do in line 880) that the weather
tation was positioned a little less than 50 km away from the study site. How can you be certain that
emperatures, humidities, and wind velocities measured about 50 km away do also apply to the study
ite? Was the location of the weather station at the same altitudes (800-1700 a.s.l.) as Al Baten? Did
you make any controls (i.e. using a hand held thermometer to correlate with the weather station)?
Please clarify.
The weather station is indeed situated at 50km from the study area of the present work. However it is
ituated in the same river-basin along the same mountain chain at 850 m asl (line 168). Our various
tudies on the houbara population in this region of Morocco are conducted at a wider scale than the
work presented here and the situation of the weather station was chosen in order to be representative
of the climate of the region. More stations would have been more accurate but it requires a significant
budget and a lot of calibration and maintenance to gather accurate data. However, the accuracy of the
data collected were compared with the satellite weather data extracted from the Global Land data
Assimilation System (GLDAS v001, Rodell et al. 2004) and were proven consistent for the region.

7/ Ad line 172: I do not understand why you define ‘good weather conditions’ as ‘wind speeds less
han 4.17 m.s-1’. In lines 149-150, however, ‘Good weather conditions’ are defined as ‘windy and rainy
days were avoided’. A wording like ‘… under good wind conditions, i.e. with a wind velocity of less than
4 m/s’ seems more appropriate to me – unless there is a hidden message in the very precise number
hat I did not catch.
Done
During each propagation experiment the wind velocity was measured. The wind speed of 4.17 m.s-1
was the highest measure of velocity recorded.
8/ Lines 184-186: How site specific are the males? Can you be absolutely certain that no male was
ubjected to both playback experiment 1 and 2 over the years 2012 and 2013?
Males were not all individually marked. Nevertheless several points explained below make very
unlikely the possibility that the same individual would be subjected to both playback experiment 1 and
2 over the years 2012 and 2013.
From 2000 to 2007, almost 80% of displaying males from the population of Al Baten area were tagged
with VHF transmitters. In 2007, 128 males were simultaneously tracked in the area. The survey brought
nformation on males’ fidelity to their displays sites: Male surveys conducted between 2002 and 2007
howed their high fidelity to their display site during the breeding season and across breeding seasons
unpublished data). Hence Hingrat et al (2004) showed that “twelve out of the 14 males marked in
2000 and 2001 were seen displaying solitarily on the same site during the whole breeding season”.
This point is now specified in the manuscript (line 194-198).
9/ Line 199: Please change ‘Avisfot’ to ‘Avisoft’.
Done
10/ Line 237: In order to relate the transmission studies to the playback studies you must state, when
in what time period) the playback experiments were actually performed (afternoon, dusk or dawn – I
presume that the visual stimuli were never used during the night when it would be pitch dark). Or did
overlook this information? Please clarify.
All experiments started at dawn, when the tested male was on its display site, as written line 251.
11/ Lines 238-239: How did you measure the distances between speaker and target display site to
obtain precise distances on the cm-scale? I find the figures surprisingly precise; ‘175 +/- 56 m’ would
eem more reasonable. Please clarify.
We agree with the referee that owing to the precision of the GPS these digits were meaningless. We
emoved them.
11/ Line 248: Please change ‘show’ to ‘showed’.
Done
12/ Lines 249-250: To help the reader you should describe the normal reaction of the lekking male (i.e.
f it stopped displaying and ran towards the speaker, how far from the speaker it stopped etc.) as most
eaders will not take time to consult [51].
The tested males were all performing complete courtship sequences before starting the playback (for
more details, see : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DQBnSctns0), as this now written more
precisely (line 263-266). During the playback males continue to display, or not, moved towards the
oudspeaker (or not) while continuing to perform courtship. We made different measures to estimate
heir behavioural responses to the signals broadcast.
13/ Lines 262-264: How did you perform these measurements? You hardly used a tape measure after
each playback as this would have disturbed the birds. Also in Online Resource 2 I am not sure what the
numbers under the heading ‘Distance to the playback set-up’ signify as they are without unit (in
contrast to all other data in the table) and all <1 but measured with three significant digits. Please
clarify.
After the experiment, when the tested male has left his display site – as they all do to go for feeding –
he experimenter was going on the location of the initial site where the male was at the beginning of
he playback, and on the location of the male when it was closest or farest to the loudspeaker during
he playback. At each of these locations, a GPS position was recorded, enabling to calculate distances.
We measured the distance between the loudspeaker and the initial display site. Then we measure the
minimal distance between the loudspeaker and the male, when the playback run or the maximal if the
male runaway. We calculated then the ratio between these 2 measures and obtained values without
unit. As 3 digits were not meaningful, we removed one.
14/ Lines 312-313: I suggest you use the past tense (i.e. ‘varied’ and ‘decreased’)
Done.
15/ Lines 395-396: Here you may consider referring to Jensen et al (2008) – see ‘Ad line 52’ above.
Done
16/ Ad Fig. 2: Please consider including a meter scale on the figure such that the reader can appreciate
he large dimensions of the speaker.
This point is now specified in the manuscript (line 890).
17/ Ad Table 1, line 875: Please consider including below ‘Afternoon; Dusk; Night; Dawn’ the actual
ime periods, i.e. ‘14:20-15:38; 17:33-18:38; etc.’ as this will help the reader of only figures and tables
o quickly get an overview.
Done.
Ad Table 2, line 883: Please consider changing the order of time periods in the table to ‘Afternoon –
Dusk – Night – Dawn’ as then the opposite developments of temperature and humidity and the dial
changes in wind velocity are more easily observed. Also consider changing ‘(dB)’ to ‘(dB re 20 µPa)’
Done.
Reviewer 2
1/ I have one main interrogation concerning the playback 3, involving acoustic and visual cues,
presented either separately or combined. Given the distance between the displaying bird and the
dummy (line 239, on average 175m) it is not obvious when reading the manuscript to understand if
he male was aware of the visual presentation of the dummy, especially when it was presented
alone. Authors specify in the discussion that “in response to the visual signal alone, males remained
at a distance from the stuffed male” and from the results it appears that they didn’t modify the
distance towards the dummy (the ration between the initial distance / the minimal (maximal)
distance male -loudspeaker after the broadcast is 0.99. When both the acoustic and visual signals
were presented the birds may have detected the dummy while responding to the playback but when
he dummy was presented alone, especially if this was the first stimulus presented, how were
authors sure that the focal male detected its presence ? Did the birds look or direct themselves while
displaying towards the dummy ?
Displaying males are observed by ECWP ecology team for 18 years in the area. Displaying males are
often seen stopping their display to run toward a female sometimes foraging at 1 km from their site!
Neighbouring displaying males are settled at mean at 550 meters from each other’s and our dummy,
which is very conspicuous, was settled much closer. In addition, we selected the broadcast site in order
o make the dummy male clearly visible from the display site of the tested male, by selecting a slightly
elevated locations, not obscured by any physical barrier (low vegetation cover. Based on these facts
and our experience, we are certain that a male cannot miss a displaying conspecific in the vicinity of
ts display site.
2/ Were there any order effects for this experiment ? One may expect a stronger response to the visual
timulus alone when it was presented in the 2nd or 3rd position vs when it was presented in the first
position.
To avoid any order effect, the playback of the different signals was randomised.
3/ Authors should maybe reformulate the sentence line 496 “Even though visual signaling appeared
not necessary in the context of intra-sexual competition” while trying to get this clearer to the reader.
Done
4/ Does the low response in the visual condition reflect a low importance of the visual cue or an
nability to correctly detect the signal in the current set-up ? Also, given the big distances between the
displaying males, do they come closer to each other at some moments? Is the visibility at dawn good
enough for birds to take into account visual cues at distances up to 550 m (average distance between
wo displaying sites) ?
The lower response of the visual cue does not necessary reflect a potential lower importance compare
o acoustic cue. We acknowledge that, even though we are confident that are dummy was visible and
detected (see response above), it was technically impossible to reproduce a full visual signaling as our
dummy was static and not moving and behaving as a live bird.
We now acknowledge this potential bias in the manuscript (Line 516-518).
Yes males are in visual contact between sites and even at farther distances (see explanations above)
and are sometime see visiting their neighbours to challenge them.
The visibility at dawn is the best of the day. The rising sun with its horizontal incidence makes the white
eathers of the displaying males shinning and visible at very long distances as the human naked eye
can detect them at 900 meters (Hingrat et al. 2008)
5/ Maybe the visual signal is taken into account only during close interactions. This would be
nteresting to be mentioned / discussed.
ndeed the visual signal must be important in both far and close interactions, and this now mentioned
n the ms (Line 510 and 512).
First, despite the long distance propagation of the acoustic signals, the visual cue is complementary as
t facilitated the localization of the booming male. Second, our recordings were done under good
weather condition and minimizing sound propagation alterations. However, in nature males have to
cope with environmental variations and are not all able to select the best sites, then visual cue alone
might sometime be determinant for a male to signal its presence.
Third, the visual cue is a part of the expression of the dancing courtship which is quite energy
demanding and the ability for the male to perform and maintain such signal might convey information
on their status and quality (not only for males but potentially for females too). Finally, feathers quality,
heir brightness can also indicate male health condition
http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111057)
6/ The distance is expressed as the ratio “initial distance male-loudspeaker / minimal (male approach)
or maximal (male runaway) distance male-loudspeaker after the broadcast. If I understood correctly,
he ratio should be > 1 when the males are approaching the loudspeaker and < 1 when they run away
rom the loudspeaker.
7/ While all the mean values (Online Resource 2) are negative, suggesting the males run away from
he loudspeaker, in the discussion of the experiment 3 it appears that the males approached the
oudspeaker during the acoustic treatment (line 489).
8/ Or the mean value for the Acoustic condition in experiment 3 is 0.566. This should not be greater
han 1 ? Can the authors make clear this point?
The referee is entirely right, and we are very grateful to him. Indeed the ratio was inverted in the
previous M & M. It is now corrected (Line 278-280).
9/ The authors mention “complete courtship sequences” (lines 249-250). Lines 101-104 - do all the
displays have both a visual (running) and an acoustic (booming) phase or are there equally incomplete
displays (visual only or acoustic only)? Do the authors have data about it? This may add to the relevance
of the experiment 3.
ndeed we have data about courtship activity at dawn and dusk, and during the night. Following intense
and long term survey of houbara bustard’s behaviour in the field, we observed complete courtship
equences at dawn and dusk, and non-complete courtship including only standing and booming phases
but not walking and running ones (unpublished data, Rybak et al. ms in prep).
As asked by the reviewer 1 a more precise description of a complete courtship sequence is now given
L263-266).
10/ Lines 184-185 - were the birds colour-ringed? If not, how did the authors know they were different
birds ? Big enough distance between sites..?
The reviewer 1 also questioned this point and we give the same answer:
Males were not all individually marked. Nevertheless several points explained below make very
unlikely the possibility that the same individual would be subjected to both playback experiment 1 and
2 over the years 2012 and 2013.
From 2000 to 2007, almost 80% of displaying males from the population of Al Baten area were tagged
with VHF transmitters. In 2007, 128 males were simultaneously tracked in the area. The survey brought
nformation on males’ fidelity to their displays sites: Male surveys conducted between 2002 and 2007
howed their high fidelity to their display site during the breeding season and across breeding seasons
unpublished data). Hence Hingrat et al (2004) showed that “twelve out of the 14 males marked in
2000 and 2001 were seen displaying solitarily on the same site during the whole breeding season”.
This point is now specified in the manuscript (line 194-198).
11/ Lines 204-207 - authors should rather mention here the natural length of a booming session
mentioned further on in the discussion, line 466), this would make it clearer for the reader why they
chose 5 and 10 booms for the playback experiment.
According to previous analyses (Cornec et al 2014), houbara bustard males produce sequences of
booms including on average 6.44 booms ± 1.44 (range = 2–11) and lasted on average 13.46 ± 3.05 s,
each boom being characterized by a very low fundamental frequency, with a mean value of 46.52 ±
2.11 Hz (range = 40–54). We added this information in the ms (line 201-204)
12/ Line 226 - concerning the bird used as a visual lure, as it was born in captivity, it would be useful
o give the age (when it died) and the size of the individual and explain how it situates relative to the
natural range of the species.
Adult males of 3 years old (borned in 2009, dead in 2012), fully feathered in the range size of adult
males:
2040g (recorded 23/01/2012, dead on 01/03/2012).
Tarse : 110.1 mm
Total skull : 115.1 mm
Size of 270 males
Mean SD Min Max

Weight (g) 1934,6 160,7 1460 2420
Total Skull (mm) 103 4,4 81 135
Tarsus (mm) 99,3 5,5 84,8 120,8
We added few more precise words about this in the ms (Line 236-238)
13/ Line 262 - how were distances estimated ?
The reviewer 1 had the same question.
After the experiment, when the tested male has left his display site – as they all do to go for feeding –
he experimenter was going on the location of the initial site where the male was at the beginning of
he playback, and on the location of the male when it was closest or farest to the loudspeaker during
he playback. At each of these locations, a GPS position was recorded, enabling to calculate distances.
We measured the distance between the loudspeaker and the initial display site. Then we measured
he minimal distance between the loudspeaker and the male, when the playback run or the maximal
f the male runaway. We calculated then the ratio between these 2 measures and obtained values
without unit.
14/ Lines 333 - I suggest authors could use the whole name of the condition instead of WFM and 2ndH
ignal, this would make it clearer for the reader
