The authors address the interesting question of identifying what drives the speed of evolution.
They suggest that mutation are not appearing randomly, but rather through an evolutionary
algorithm, which could allow to reproduce some of the observed patterns in evolutionary history
such as massive extinction or diversity explosion. First, I have to say that I have already reviewed
this paper when it has been submitted to Interface, so my opinion is a little bit biased in the sense
that I'm inclined considering this paper as a resubmission rather than a first submission.
As when it has been previously submitted, I still like the goal of this paper. I also think that Royal
Society Open Sciences is probably a bit more appropriated than Interface, since the
interdisciplinarity aspect is maybe less the gravity center of this journal. Finally, I also appreciate
the effort that the authors have made in the presentation of their results. However, I still think
that the introduction has still to be structured a bit more properly because, as it stands, it is not
extremely clear what is the motivation/Rationale of the study.
More importantly, the authors did not improve the way to test their algorithm. The biological
argument is that uniform random mutation cannot explain the pattern of diversities observed
during evolutionary history (which is by the way quite vague...). But to show that this
evolutionary algorithm represents a credible new possibility, it needs to be compared to other
algorithms than the random uniform one (just considering for instance that mutation do not have
the same effect on organism fitness is clearly the first thing to try as we know it is the case and
can generate very complex evolutionary dynamics). As it stands, the authors just show that how
their algorithm works and what it produces, suggesting that it could makes sense with the
recorded evolutionary history (which is also not quantified, or even at least compared).
Moreover, the rationale (saying that random mutations is not sufficient) is a bit fallacious.
Definitely, if we focus on evolutionary dynamics of parasites, random mutation can definitely
explain most the patterns observed. The way the authors choose their examples is not very clear,
and it will be much more convincing if these examples represent a good diversity of the
evolutionary systems that can be found in nature.

Answer to reviewer 1:
“As when it has been previously submitted, I still like the goal of this
paper.”
Thanks for liking the goal of our paper.
“I also think that Royal Society Open Sciences is probably a bit more
appropriated than Interface, since the interdisciplinarity aspect is
maybe less the gravity center of this journal. Finally, I also appreciate
the effort that the authors have made in the presentation of their
results.”
Thanks. We appreciate these comments. We have made an effort to
follow all the reviewer’s suggestions from the previous submission
round and to carry them to this new submission. We are glad that you
found them appropriate and that you found that we took them
onboard.
“However, I still think that the introduction has still to be structured a
bit more properly because, as it stands, it is not extremely clear what
is the motivation/Rationale of the study.”
You are absolutely right. The main rationale comes from the work of
Chaitin and his metabiology programme. We have made an effort to
reorganise and explain it better in this version. We have now the
section about Chaitin’s program earlier in the paper and a better-
motivated intro. Thanks for pointing this out.
“More importantly, the authors did not improve the way to test their
algorithm. The biological argument is that uniform random mutation
cannot explain the pattern of diversities observed during evolutionary
history (which is by the way quite vague...). But to show that this
evolutionary algorithm represents a credible new possibility, it needs
to be compared to other algorithms than the random uniform one (just
considering for instance that mutation do not have the same effect on
organism fitness is clearly the first thing to try as we know it is the
case and can generate very complex evolutionary dynamics). As it
stands, the authors just show that how their algorithm works and what
it produces, suggesting that it could makes sense with the recorded
evolutionary history (which is also not quantified, or even at least
compared).”
All things equal and without making considerations to other genetic
operations e.g. sexual vs asexual reproduction that we did not test
and we consider beyond the scope of this paper, our results indicate
that the operation of random mutation based on algorithmic
probability converges faster and may have interesting implications
regarding phenomenology such as genetic modularity and massive
extinctions. Evidently this claim is not completely independent of
fitness function and we have now made a remark in this regard, by
exhibiting a case in which, for example, the particular choice of
fitness function would rather slow down rather than speed up the rate
of convergence and in which situations. That is, for example, a
counter-intuitive fitness function that seeks to maximise algorithmic
randomness, in this case we would evidently be slower than uniform
random mutations.
“Moreover, the rationale (saying that random mutations is not
sufficient) is a bit fallacious. Definitely, if we focus on evolutionary
dynamics of parasites, random mutation can definitely explain most
the patterns observed.
We have corrected this claim, now it is saying something less strong,
and we are not constrained to small organisms but rather the
surprising rate at which larger organisms have converged.
“The way the authors choose their examples is not very clear, and it
will be much more convincing if these examples represent a good
diversity of the evolutionary systems that can be found in nature.”
We consider this question beyond the scope of this particular paper.
We would like to be able to publish this paper first before moving to
other interesting questions as suggested by the reviewer.
