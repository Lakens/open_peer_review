The paper by Liu et al. described the incorporation of RGO into faceted flower-like {001} TiO2 for
enhanced photocatalytic activity. This work is a good contribution to the field and could be
published in Royal Society Open Science after major revision as mentioned below:
1. This paper deals with the incorporation of RGO in TiO2 to enhance photocatalytic properties.
The most recent literature in this field should be cited in the introduction and discussed. See for
instance: J. Phys. Chem. C, 2017, 121, 261–269 and New J. Chem., 2018,42, 1250-1259
2. The paper should contain a material section containing the CAS numbers and purity of the
used chemicals.
3. The wavelength and the intensity of light should be given in the photocatalytic section
4. The abbreviation used in the paper like as ET-15, WT-15, ET-0, and WT-0 make the manuscript
very difficult to follow.
5. Error bar should be added to all the graphs and all tables in the manuscript.
6. The stability of the catalyst should be evaluated; At least 10 cycles should be performed and
added to the manuscript.
7. Conclusion is too short. Please rewrite and resume the main finding of the paper.

I don’t think this manuscript is worth publishing in RSOS because of the following reasons:
1) The topic, {001} TiO2/RGO as photocatalyst for enhanced photocatalytic activity, has been
widely reported , such as PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS 2013, 15, 12963-12970;
JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C 2012, 116, 19893-19901; ACS APPLIED MATERIALS
& INTERFACES 2013, 5, 3085-3093; JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE 2014,
430, 100–107; JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C 2013, 117, 16022-16027. etc.
2) The photocatalytic activities of the developed {001} TiO2/RGO catalysts for the degradation of
basic violet are very poor (Fig. 9).
3) There is no solid evidence to verify that the prepared TiO2 is {001} exposed TiO2 (Fig. 4 and
Fig. 5), and the percentage of {001} facet is not known.
4) The structure that TiO2 particles were gathered together on graphene (Fig. 4) is not helpful for
the enhancement of photocatalytic activity.

In this study, the authors reported the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/{001} faceted
TiO2 composites via a solvothermal method. The resultant catalyst was systematically
characterized and used for degradation of organic pollutant. The results from materials
characterizations suggested the graphene oxide was reduced during the preparation process of
the {001} faceted TiO2, and combined with the surface of {001} TiO2. The photocatalytic
experiments showed that the E catalysts exhibited higher photocatalytic activities compared to W
catalysts, due to the more efficient integration of graphene and {001} faceted TiO2. The results are
interesting and the manuscript is well structured and described. I suggest it is accepted after
some minor revisions.
1. Please label RGO in Figure 5c.
2. The text illustration in Figure 10 is not clear enough. The authors should improve it.
3. Some latest literatures, such as Journal of Alloys and Compounds, 2015, 650, 520; Dalton

The paper by Liu et al. described the incorporation of RGO into
faceted flower-like {001} TiO2 for enhanced photocatalytic activity.
This work is a good contribution to the field and could be published in
Royal Society Open Science after major revision as mentioned below:
1. This paper deals with the incorporation of RGO in TiO2 to
enhance photocatalytic properties. The most recent literature in this
field should be cited in the introduction and discussed. See for instance:
J. Phys. Chem. C, 2017, 121, 261–269 and New J. Chem., 2018,42,
1250-1259
Response: The literatures have been cited and discussed in the
Introduction in revised manuscript.
2. The paper should contain a material section containing the CAS
numbers and purity of the used chemicals.
Response: Thanks for the referee’s suggestion. A material section has
been added in the revised manuscript. Please find it on page 6 line
8-14.
3. The wavelength and the intensity of light should be given in the
photocatalytic section.
Response: The wavelength and the intensity of light have been stated
in photocatalytic section. The details could be found on page 8 line
20-21 and page 15 line 10-11.
4. The abbreviation used in the paper like as ET-15, WT-15, ET-0,
and WT-0 make the manuscript very difficult to follow.
Response: Sorry for making the referee confusing about the
abbreviation. However, we need abbreviation to represent different
materials, and the explanation of the abbreviation was clearly stated in
the preparation section.
5. Error bar should be added to all the graphs and all tables in the
manuscript.
Response: Error bar was already included in all the graphs in the
manuscript.
6. The stability of the catalyst should be evaluated; At least 10 cycles
should be performed and added to the manuscript.
Response: Recycling experiments have been conducted with the
results added into the revised manuscript (Figure 9a), as well as XRD
spectra (Figure 9b) of the material before and after 10 cycles. The
description of recycling experiments could be found from page 15 line
18 to page 16 line 2.
7. Conclusion is too short. Please rewrite and resume the main
finding of the paper.
Response: Conclusion has been modified in the revised manuscript.
8. The photocatalytic mechanism should be added to the paper.
Response: Thanks for the referee’s suggestion. The photocatalytic
mechanism has been discussed, the details could be found on page 16
line 14-21, as well as in Figure 10 in the revised manuscript.
9. Figure 2 is useless. Please remove from the manuscript.
Response: Figure 2 has been deleted.
10. There is a big problem with all the figures number in the
manuscript. Please correct.
Response: The figures number have been corrected and double
checked.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
I don’t think this manuscript is worth publishing in RSOS because of
the following reasons:
1) The topic, {001} TiO2/RGO as photocatalyst for enhanced
photocatalytic activity, has been widely reported , such as PHYSICAL
CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS 2013, 15, 12963-12970;
JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C 2012, 116,
19893-19901; ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES 2013,
5, 3085-3093; JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE
SCIENCE 2014, 430, 100–107; JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL
CHEMISTRY C 2013, 117, 16022-16027. etc.
Response: Although a few of literatures about {001} TiO2/RGO have
been reported, we either used different preparation method (compared
to ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES, 2013, 5,
3085-3093, JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
2014, 430, 100–107 and PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL
PHYSICS, 2013, 15, 12963-12970) or improved the photocatalytic
activity by the addition of ethanol during the preparation process
(compared to JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C, 2012, 116,
19893-19901). In addition, the reference (JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL
CHEMISTRY C, 2013, 117, 16022-16027) was about <U+FB01>rst-principle
calculations without experiments.
2) The photocatalytic activities of the developed {001} TiO2/RGO
catalysts for the degradation of basic violet are very poor (Fig. 9).
Response: In Fig. 9 (Fig. 8 in the revised manuscript), BV is very
stable and resistant to degrade under white light irradiation. However,
with W and E catalysts, BV degraded by 60.2% and 75.8% in 2.5 h
respectively, which was more than two times that of pure {001} facet
TiO2. And it is know that, the degradation rate is related to the amount
of catalyst added into the system. In our study, the concentration of
photocatalyst was 0.2 mg/mL, while in most of the literatures
mentioned above, the catalyst concentration was 1.0 mg/mL, which
was 5 times that of the catalyst concentration in this study.
3) There is no solid evidence to verify that the prepared TiO2 is {001}
exposed TiO2 (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5), and the percentage of {001} facet is
not known.
Response: In Fig. 5 (Fig. 4e in the revised manuscript), “The lattice
fringes of the small nanosheets may be clearly seen in Figure 4e,
which were ca. 0.235 nm, which is consistent with that of reported
{001} facets [29]”, which was an evidence for {001} exposed TiO2.
4) The structure that TiO2 particles were gathered together on
graphene (Fig. 4) is not helpful for the enhancement of photocatalytic
activity.
Response: Just as the referee’s mentioned, some of the TiO2 particles
were gathered together on graphene (and some were scattered), so it is
worthy of further study to make the TiO2 particles scattered more
uniformly on graphene and to make charge transfer more efficiently.

faceted TiO2. The results are interesting and the manuscript is well
structured and described. I suggest it is accepted after some minor
revisions.
1. Please label RGO in Figure 5c.
Response: RGO has been labeled in Figure 5c (Figure 4c in the revised
manuscript).
2. The text illustration in Figure 10 is not clear enough. The authors
should improve it.
Response: Figure 10 has been modified and improved.
3.Some latest literatures, such as Journal of Alloys and Compounds,

Transactions, 2017, 46, 15727 are valuable for being referred to.
Response: The literatures have been cited in the Introduction in the
revised manuscript.
