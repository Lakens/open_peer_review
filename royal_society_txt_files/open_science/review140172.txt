Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript describes and analyses simple sequence repeats found withing mitochondrial
DNA sequences. They show that these sites are "hotspots" of mutation. The paper then links a
subset of the hotspots to sites that are under positive selection, implying that these SSRs are
important "potentiators" of subsequent selective sites. Without knowing the evidence to support
the assumption of positive selection, actually judging the given analyses as robust is quite hard.
The described correlations are very intriguing. The observation that nearly all of there putative
selective sites are at SSRs is quite interesting. It is also reassuring to see that there are other SSRs,
but lacking the positive selection signal. This helps to support the claim that these site may
indeed be unique. However, the conclusions and entire tone of the paper are directly dependent
on another paper by the authors, which is itself currently under review. Therefore status of that
paper, which provides the evidence that the site are indeed under positive selection, is essential
to judge the merits of this paper. Without knowing the fate of that paper, I cannot assess whether
the main assumption - that the sites found in the unpublished paper are strongly supported as
alleles under positive selection. I suggest that the decision to publish this paper be put off until
the first paper is published, or that the second manuscript be made available to us to aid in our
review of this paper.

Comments to the Author(s)
Garvin and Gharratt hypothesize that the generation of positively selected sites in the
mitochondrial coding region is driven by the interplay of slip-strand mis-pairing of small
sequence repeats (SSRs, and ensuing mutations) and functional constraints of the affected
respiratory enzyme complexes. The authors set out to test this hypothesis by determining the
frequency at which SSRs occur at previously identified positively selected mitochondrial sites
across several animal taxa. In the example chosen by the authors (ND5), this comparison shows
that SSRs occur at higher rates at these sites than would be expected by chance. Evidence for the
genetic footprint of positive selection in the mitochondrial genome across diverse taxa is
increasing steadily. Thus, studies aiming to shed light on genetic (as described here) or
evolutionary mechanisms that drive mitochondrial genome evolution, and therefore the
generation of positively selected sites are most welcome. I find this an interesting manuscript and
have only few comments: General: I am not convinced of the usefulness of the infinite monkey
theorem in this context, and wonder whether a more specific title would earn the authors greater
3
exposure and future citation success. While I generally understand that data sets are split into
separate manuscripts, it irks me a bit that this manuscript builds on - and repeatedly refers to -
Garvin et al in prep without having access to it. It would make a much better ms if this
information was accessible. In any case, publication of Garvin et al in prep should precede
potential publication of this article. If not wording of the ms may require slight changes to avoid
referencing what cannot be accessed. Minor: Line 6: perhaps rather say that this mechanism is
likely to contribute to the process of speciation. Line 36: Figure 1: please accession no in the figure
legend for the salmon reference genome Lines 41/42: perhaps change to: (1) the mechanism of
contraction and expansion of SSR provide…. Line 68 and 74: add references Line 126: please
repharse “for comparisons sake” Lines 155FF: Yes, selection can act within cells, between cells,
etc., BUT that all doesn’t matter if the selected sites do not enter the female germ line. And within
the female germ line, mitochondrial bottlenecks and purifying selection are acting to promote
clonality. After all, of those billions of mitochondrial molecules in salmon eggs, only few are
transmitted to offspring (see PLoS One 6: e20522). It should be considered in the ms that while
haplotype shifts can be rapid, there are also mechanisms in place to avoid exactly that, and to
maintain/transmit a healthy clonal population of mitochondrial genomes. Line 170: While I agree
that some of the processes, such as described here, are non-random, but surely it will not be
limited to these processes. Spontaneous mutations at non-SSR sites will contribute to this
evolutionary process as well. This should be acknowledged.

Dear Dr Garvin
Manuscript ID RSOS-140029 entitled "Evolution: Are the Monkeys’ Typewriters Rigged?" which
you submitted to Royal Society Open Science, has been reviewed. The comments from reviewers
are included at the bottom of this letter.
In view of the criticisms of the reviewers, the manuscript has been rejected in its current form.
However, a new manuscript may be submitted which takes into consideration these comments.
Please note that resubmitting your manuscript does not guarantee eventual acceptance, and that
your resubmission will be subject to peer review before a decision is made.
You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of your
manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript and upload the files via your author centre. Once
you have revised your manuscript, go to http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and login to
your Author Center. Click on "Manuscripts with Decisions," and then click on "Create a
Resubmission" located next to the manuscript number. Then, follow the steps for resubmitting
your manuscript. Your resubmitted manuscript should be submitted within 4 months of the date
of this email. If you are unable to submit by this date please contact the Editorial Office.

Authors' response to original reviewers' comments
Dear Dr. Wray, Thank you for considering our manuscript for publication in your journal. We
appreciated the comments of the reviewers and have edited the manuscript accordingly. One
main criticism was that we cited a manuscript that was under review and did not include a copy
of it with this manuscript. That manuscript has been accepted for publication and we will attach a
copy of it with this resubmission because it is in press as of today. As to specific points: Line 6:
this has been changed to reflect the reviewer's suggestion. Line 36: We added accession numbers
for all species in the figure. Lines 41/42: We changed the text to reflect the reviewer's suggestion.
Lines 68 and 74: References have been added. Line 126: We edited this sentence to make is
clearer. Line 155: We agree with the reviewer, updated the text and added the PLoS One
reference. Line 170: We agree with the reviewer and have edited the text here to reflect that. With
regards to the title and the analogy to the Monkey Theorem, we realize that this is not a typical
title for a scientific paper but we are trying to reach a broader audience with this new Open
Access journal. If you think a different title would be more acceptable to your journal we are not
opposed to changing it.
Regards,
Michael Garvin
