The authors present the fourth in a series of papers on cell blebbing. Here they describe possible
phenomenological mechanisms for retraction of a bleb, and identify that, if the governing
mechanisms are membrane and cortex shrinking with the membrane and cortex connected by
proteins, then both the membrane and cortex need to shrink at roughly the same rate to enable
retraction. Given the arclengths of the membrane and cortex, and regions where the they are
connected by adhesion proteins, force balance arguments lead to numerical solutions for the
shape of the cell. The mathematical modelling is consistent with the hypotheses. The results are
interesting but I am concerned that the hypotheses may be unrealistic and the paper needs to be
revised to address this (see point 2 below).
Main comments:
1. Although much of the derivation of the model has been published before, there does needs to
be some discussion of the numerical methods used and, crucially, evidence that the numerical
solutions are accurate should be given.
2. Imposing phenomenological rules for the shrinking of the membrane and cortex in the
unstressed reference configuration ignores forces on the membrane and cortex in the current
configuration that may well control shrinkage. In addition, Figure 1 suggests that there is
localised thickening of the cortex (highly polymerised actin) within the bleb as it retracts. What
justification is there for neglecting these mechanisms?
3. Please discuss the biological arguments for possible mechanisms for membrane growth and
retraction.
Minor comments:
Ref. 19 is incomplete.
Several initial phrases need to be separated from their main clauses by commas for the sake of
clarity, e.g. in the second sentence of the Abstract.
Q in (2.7) should be Q_s.
At the end of line 46 on page 5, add 'in (2.5)' for clarity.
In (2.9). replace 'E(\sigma)^2' by 'E^2(\sigma)'.
On line 11 of page 6 and elsewhere, the notation for units in '100/3/\mu m' is better written as
{\mu m}^{-1}.

This study extends prior work by the authors on a mechanical model of cell blebbing. The model
describes interaction between the cell membrane, modeled as a thin shell, and the underlying
actin cortex. The model predicts that combined cortical shrinkage and membrane shrinkage can
together describe bleb retraction.
Prior work by the authors (ref. 19) is referred to frequently yet is not available for reference, and
is presumably under review elsewhere. I cannot therefore independently assess the novelty of
the present work in relation to material contained in ref. 19. Subject to this caveat, however, the
work as a whole appears original and interesting. My few comments below relate primarily to
presentation.
I notice the work is listed as a review, yet focuses primarily on the authors’ own model. I am
therefore judging it as a normal article. The unnecessary web link at the bottom of each printed
page meant that I could not clearly read some equations and text.
The paper’s title is long and contains the phrase “and suggests that bleb induced blebbing may
occur.” However this is not supported by direct evidence, beyond a throwaway phrase at the
end of the discussion. The first half of the title is sufficient (but change “is” to “are”).
It is disappointing that there is limited direct experimental data provided in support of the
model’s predictions. Measurements of pressure for example would be key in testing the
predictions in Fig 8a. To avoid the risk of overselling the results, please avoid the term
“phenotypes” (page 6), as it suggests the model somehow directly accounts for gene expression.
The model equations 2.1-2.10 could usefully be described in a little more detail, highlighting force
and moment balances for example. It is curious to use the label y (described as a “vertical”
coordinate) in an axisymmetric problem when it represents a radial distance from the axis.
In Table 1, please distinguish variables from parameters, as it is helpful for the reader to see the
number of unknown parameters that must be determined. eta_1, eta_2 and delta are missing

from the list, and from Table 2. I don’t understand why the key equations in parts b and c of the
appendix do not appear in the main text - they are central to the model.

here on the basis of a single example. Is this a robust statement?

Prior work by the authors (ref. 19) is referred to frequently yet is not available
for reference, and is presumably under review elsewhere. I cannot therefore
independently assess the novelty of the present work in relation to material
contained in ref. 19. Subject to this caveat, however, the work as a whole
appears original and interesting. My few comments below relate primarily to
presentation.
We thank the reviewer and editor for their time and comments and hope that the ac-
companying changes meet with their satisfaction. In addition to the changes discussed we
have used this revision to make small changes aimed at improving style and presentation.
Reference 19 has just been accepted for publication in the Journal of Theoretical Biology.
The citation has been updated to reflect this, however, only the DOI is available as it
an “online first” article. In terms of novelty, the work in this paper and reference 19 are
completely separate. The previous paper deals with the production of blebs with the cor-
rect expansion features, as such it does not consider a reforming cortex and, consequently,
does not seek to understand retraction in any way.
Please note that due to changes in the article some of the reference numbers have
altered. In particular, reference 19 is now reference 20.
1. I notice the work is listed as a review, yet focuses primarily on the authors
own model. I am therefore judging it as a normal article. The unnecessary
web link at the bottom of each printed page meant that I could not clearly
read some equations and text.
The reviewer is quite correct, this work should have been listed as a normal article.
We apologise for the web link obscuring some of the text. However, this appears
once the tex file has been compiled through the journal’s submission servers, thus,
we do not believe we are able to alter this.
2. The papers title is long and contains the phrase “and suggests that bleb
induced blebbing may occur.” However this is not supported by direct
evidence, beyond a throwaway phrase at the end of the discussion. The
first half of the title is sufficient (but change “is” to “are”).
The suggested changes have been incorporated into the manuscript. The title is now
“Membrane shrinkage and cortex remodelling are predicted to work in harmony to
retract blebs”.
3. It is disappointing that there is limited direct experimental data pro-
vided in support of the models predictions. Measurements of pressure
for example would be key in testing the predictions in Fig 8a.
This is true and we hope that this and our previous work provides impetus for
experimental groups to try and experimentally evaluate the intracellular pressure of
blebbing cells. One particular avenue we are exploring is in collaboration with the
University of Reading and University College London. Currently, the only paper we
know of that tries to measure the pressure difference in blebbing cells is referenced
in the paper: J. Dai and M. P. Sheetz. Membrane tether formation from blebbing
cells. Biophys. J., 77(6):3363–3370, 1999. It is from this paper that we generate the
value of <U+2206>P that is used throughout the manuscript.
4. To avoid the risk of overselling the results, please avoid the term “pheno-
types” (page 6), as it suggests the model somehow directly accounts for
gene expression.
Phenotypes has been changed to morphologies
5. The model equations 2.1-2.10 could usefully be described in a little more
detail, highlighting force and moment balances for example.
The equation list has been rewritten such that there are explicit labels by each
equation. These labels, along with the accompanying detailed discussion of the
equations, should help the reader better understand the construction of the system.
6. It is curious to use the label y (described as a “vertical” coordinate) in
an axisymmetric problem when it represents a radial distance from the
axis.
The reviewer is correct that since we dealing with an axisymmetric problem we could
have presented the problem as dependent on a radial variable instead of y. However,
due to this symmetry we only need to consider a single plane of the solid, in which
this radial variable and the normal Cartesian variable are identical. Hence, in order
to reduce confusion, we reserve names that have rotational connotations to name
spherically symmetric bodies, such as the initial cortex, rc . When we are working
on the cylindrically symmetric body, we prefer to work with the Cartesian variables
instead. The second paragraph of Section 2 has been altered to emphasise this point
“Equation set (2.1) define the axisymmetrical geometry of the shell around the
axis of rotational symmetry, here taken to be the z-axis (see Figure 2). Since the
two-dimensional shell is axisymmetric we only need to consider a one-dimensional
cross-section, at which point the radial coordinates can be related to the standard
rectilinear Cartesian coordinates. Specifically, a reference configuration, (z¯, y¯), corre-
sponding to the unstressed state, is parameterized by its arc length, s and measured
from the intercept of the curve with the z-axis.”
7. In Table 1, please distinguish variables from parameters, as it is helpful
for the reader to see the number of unknown parameters that must be
determined. <U+03B7>1 , <U+03B7>2 and delta are missing from the list, and from Table 2.
Table 1 has been reorganised such that all of the variables are at the top and all of
the parameters, including <U+03B7>1 and <U+03B7>2 , are at the bottom. A small break in the table
has been included to delimit the transition. Table 2 is specifically for parameters
that are fixed throughout all simulations and are based on data. <U+03B7>1 and <U+03B7>2 do not
have any specified values and, further, we are interested in their ratio, rather than
their individual values, thus, we have not added them to Table 2. However, we have
added the following sentence to the first paragraph of the results section “The value
of the ratio <U+03B7>1 /<U+03B7>2 can be found in the caption of each simulation.”
8. I dont understand why the key equations in parts b and c of the appendix
do not appear in the main text - they are central to the model.
We have added these sections into paragraph 3 and 8 of Section 2, respectively.
9. Bottom of page 11: “bleb expansion greatly reduces pressure” - the
qualifier “greatly” is used here on the basis of a single example. Is this a
robust statement?
The large reduction in pressure is seen throughout all our work on blebbing cells.
In particular, this feature is observed in all models of reference 16, which deals with
three similar, but different models of blebs that capture different levels of detail. To
emphasise this point we have added further detail: “Namely, bleb expansion greatly
reduces the intracellular pressure and, thus, the expansion force acting on the bleb,
which matches the predictions of our previous work [15,16,20]”
2 Reviewer 2
The authors present the fourth in a series of papers on cell blebbing. Here they
describe possible phenomenological mechanisms for retraction of a bleb, and
identify that, if the governing mechanisms are membrane and cortex shrinking
with the membrane and cortex connected by proteins, then both the mem-
brane and cortex need to shrink at roughly the same rate to enable retraction.
Given the arclengths of the membrane and cortex, and regions where they are
connected by adhesion proteins, force balance arguments lead to numerical
solutions for the shape of the cell. The mathematical modelling is consistent
with the hypotheses. The results are interesting but I am concerned that the
hypotheses may be unrealistic and the paper needs to be revised to address
this.
We thank the reviewer for their comments and hope that the accompanying changes
meet with their satisfaction.
1. Although much of the derivation of the model has been published before,
there does need to be some discussion of the numerical methods used
and, crucially, evidence that the numerical solutions are accurate should
be given.
The whole simulation can be envisioned simply as an iterated root finding prob-
lem. Specifically, once the simulations are initialised, the boundary value problem
is solved repeatedly with various different values of <U+2206>P until the difference between
the volume of the output solution and the initial volume constant is below some
given tolerance.
Both the root finding and the boundary value problem were solved using algorithms
from MATLAB R2013a, namely BVP5C and fsolve. The algorithms were used for
their flexibility and ability to automatically control errors.
Due to the linearisation of the boundaries at s = 0 and p<U+03C1> (discussed in the ap-
pendix), we can only be accurate to within an order of o2 = 10-6 at these points, as
such, we fixed the error tolerances in the codes to be 10-6 . The maximum error in
each simulation of the expansion and contraction simulation is illustrated in Figure
1 and demonstrates that this bound is attained after each iteration.
Figure 1: During the expansion and contraction phases of the simulated bleb the maximum
residual error over all variables never grows above 10-6 in magnitude.
Although the reviewer is quite right to check our error terms, we do not believe that
adding in a number of figures similar to Figure 1, would be of benefit. We have
added the following paragraph which does evidence the fact that we have checked
that the error terms stay small throughout the simulation. However, if the reviewer
disagrees we are happy to put the figures in. The additional paragraph is as follows
and occurs at the start of the results section.
“Before we discuss the results of bleb retraction, we first, briefly, address the matter
of simulation work flow and, in particular, bleb production. The whole simulation
can be envisioned as an iterated root finding problem. Specifically, upon initialisa-
tion, system (2.1)-(2.5) is solved as a boundary value problem (boundary constraints
are discussed in Appendix (a)) for various different values of <U+2206>P . The value of <U+2206>P
is iterated until the difference between the volume of the output solution and the
initial volume constant is below a given tolerance. Once this tolerance is achieved
the reference configuration and cortex are updated, if needed. Since each iteration
only modifies the solution a small amount we would expect the next solution state
to be approximately similar to the previous solution state. Thus the updated ref-
erence configuration and cortex curves are fed back into the root finding algorithm,
along with the previous solution state. The algorithm uses the previous solution
as an initialisation state, around which to search for the new solution. Through-
out the simulation it was ensured that the numerical errors were never greater than
the errors included due to the the linearisation of the boundary points (data not
shown).”
2. Imposing phenomenological rules for the shrinking of the membrane and
cortex in the unstressed reference configuration ignores forces on the
membrane and cortex in the current configuration that may well control
shrinkage. In addition, Figure 1 suggests that there is localised thickening
of the cortex (highly polymerised actin) within the bleb as it retracts.
What justification is there for neglecting these mechanisms?
One should note that the system is extensively overdamped. The force balance per
se does not dictate its evolution in that the system relaxes to its equilibrium very
rapidly. Thus the forces in the current configuration will be compensated on very fast
timescales by the relaxation of the cortex and membrane to quasi-static equilibrium.
Such processes cannot be directly driving bleb retraction due to the mismatch of
timescales. Instead it is more appropriate that the evolution of the properties of the
cortex and membrane guide the retraction.
Further the impact of the localised thickening of the cortex in Fig 1 is unclear as,
for instance, it is not clear if it is accompanied with enhanced myosin aggregation
and thus greater contractile forces. Without further information we have presented
the simplest case of no change.
These justifications suggest that a phenomenological model is justified and secondly
that a more detailed model cannot be supported from the available data and under-
standing. Hence our choice of modelling framework, including the representation of
retraction.
The following paragraph has been added to the Bleb retraction sections
“As the bleb is retracted the system is effectively always in quasi-steady state as
the system is overdamped. Hence retraction is driven by remodelling timescales.
Equally, the impact of any heterogeneity in the thickness of the cortex is unclear,
because we cannot be sure that it is accompanied with enhanced myosin aggregation
and, thus, greater contractile forces, or if a thicker cortex would be harder to manip-
ulate and, thus, slower to retract. Without further information we have presented
the simplest case of constant heterogeneous structures. ”
3. Please discuss the biological arguments for possible mechanisms for mem-
brane growth and retraction.
Currently, it is not known, in the case of blebbing, how extra membrane can be
produced and removed as quickly as observed. It has been hypothesised that extra
membrane stems from high levels of wrinkling in the cellular surface. Alternatively,
it has been suggested that endo- and exo-cytosis processes could account for the
membrane activity through localised recruitment. In both cases, the growth of the
membrane can be modelled as an increase reference configuration, which is our ap-
proach.
In terms of retraction it is thought that myosin motors contract the cortex, causing
it to shrink. To our knowledge there are currently no theories regarding the coupling
the cortex contraction to the membrane shrinking. Due to the lack of knowledge as
this level, we use a phenomenological description of membrane and cortex shrinking,
which captures the idea that the myosin motors are causing the cortex to shrink,
but is not based on further dynamics.
The second, third and fifth paragraphs of the introduction have been expanded to
include these details,
“ If a cells internal pressure is higher than the external pressure the pressure dif-
ference induces a flow of the cells cytosol driving the membrane away from the cell
and into a spherical protrusion, known as a bleb [8]. This localised swelling re-
quires additional membrane to cover the bleb, but it is not currently known how
this extra membrane can be produced and removed as quickly as observed. It has
been hypothesised that extra membrane stems from high levels of wrinkling in the
cellular surface [9]. Alternatively, it has been suggested that endo- and exo-cytosis
processes could account for the membrane activity through localised recruitment
[10]. In both cases, the growth of the membrane can be modelled as an increase in
reference configuration, which is the approach taken here.
After approximately 10-30 seconds the bleb expansion stops and an actin cortex
reforms inside the bleb. Over a longer time scale of 1-2 minutes the cell retracts the
newly formed cortex within the bleb (which is coupled to the membrane), causing
the bleb to shrink back into the cell, and allowing the process to begin again (see
Figure 1). It is thought that myosin motors contract the cortex, causing it to shrink
[10]. It is this retraction phase that we are interested in modelling in this paper
because bleb retraction is required for cells to move efficiently.”
“Although blebbing is an extremely complex behaviour, the structural shape of a cell
is thought to depend on three components: a flexible lipid bilayer membrane, a stiff
actin cortex and adhesion proteins that couple these two structures [8]. Mathemati-
cal modelling offers a framework within which hypotheses can be tested, generating
new predictions concerning the underlying mechanisms that control the blebbing
expansion and retraction cycle. The hypothesis currently present in the biological
literature is that blebs shrink simply due to the retraction of the blebs reformed cor-
tex, implying that the membrane is slave to the dynamics of the cortex [10]. Here, we
test the biophysical and mechanical plausibility of experimentally suggested mecha-
nisms that induce bleb retraction. However, an absence of molecular-level knowledge
entails that we implement a phenomenological model of membrane and cortex re-
traction which captures the concept that myosin motors induce cortex shrinkage,
but without detailed dynamics.”
4. Ref. 19 is incomplete.
Reference 19 has just been accepted for publication in the Journal of Theoretical
Biology. The citation has been updated to reflect this.
5. Several initial phrases need to be separated from their main clauses by
commas for the sake of clarity, e.g. in the second sentence of the Abstract.
The article has been proof read again and additional commas have been added for
clarity.
6. Q in (2.7) should be Qs . At the end of line 46 on page 5, add ‘in (2.5)’
for clarity. In (2.9). replace ‘E(s)2 ’ by ‘E 2 (s)’. On line 11 of page 6 and
elsewhere, the notation for units in ‘100/3/µ m’ is better written as µm-1 .
Page 6, line 15: ‘because’ is redundant or text is missing. Page 6, line
29: ‘As demonstrated IN [19]’. Page 3, line 21: ‘solid mechanicS’.
These small errors have all been corrected.

1 Alterations
We thank the reviewer and editor for their time and comments and hope that the accom-
panying changes meet with their satisfaction.
Reviewer 1 All of their small alterations have been included except for their sugges-
tion that the word “are” should be removed form Page 10, line 4 as we could not see which
word they were referring to.
Reviewer 2 In order to discuss the lack of cortex thickening in our model we highlight
this process in the introduction with the addition of the line
“ It is thought that myosin motors contract the cortex, causing it to shrink and,
potentially, thicken.”
as well as the more detailed discussion in Section 2.(a)
“As the bleb is retracted the system is effectively always in quasi-steady state as the
system is overdamped. Hence retraction is driven by remodelling timescales. Equally,
the impact of any heterogeneity in the thickness of the cortex is unclear, because we
cannot be sure that it is accompanied with enhanced myosin aggregation and, thus, greater
contractile forces, or if a thicker cortex would be harder to manipulate and, thus, slower
to retract. Without further information we have presented the simplest case of constant
heterogeneous structures.”
