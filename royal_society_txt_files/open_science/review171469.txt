This paper investigates on an ammonia supply system for flue gas denitrification of low speed
marine diesel. Typically, NOx in the flue gas are reduced by ammonia. For safety reasons,
ammonia is released from the decomposition of a precursor. The authors have preferentially
selected ammonium bicarbonate instead of urea because this component is cheaper with thermal
decomposition starting at lower temperature. This study proposes a modelling study to optimize
heat transfer occurring in the different steps involved in the thermal decomposition of
ammonium bicarbonate and the production of ammonia.
Despite this study is original and can provide new information, this paper is difficult to read and
cannot be accepted in this form. Indeed, some clarifications are needed avoiding an important
dilution in the writing which harms in the global understanding of the study and these objectives.
Finally, an important aspect is likely related to the presence of impurities in the inlet flow of
ammonia and the consequences on the SCR process. I suggest the authors to submit a more
concise paper which focuses on the most important information compared to previous reported
data and/or already published.
All the symbols used should be included in a separate section in an annex.
P. 4-5 – The description of the physicochemical processes occurring in the installation should be
written more concisely including the heat consumed or released for each steps if possible. Indeed,
this presentation is purely qualitative. Eventually, this part could be included in the introduction
section.
The name of the steps of reaction (4) and (5) is unclear at least for reaction (5) which does not
match with a desorption step. The physical state of the different components should be specified.

This paper describes a system to decrease the NOx concentration in marine diesel engine flue
gases using ammonia. Due to the hazards posed by storing liquid ammonia it is proposed to
make it on the ship using ammonium carbonate and waste heat from the ships engines. This
paper presents an investigation of the technical feasibility of the process system required to do
this. Unfortunately it fails in its objectives for a number of reasons.
1. The description of the process system is very poor and I could only work out what was going
on by using the diagram and referring to other sources.
2. There is a lack of detail in the experimental section, with no justification being given for the
range of variables used and a very poor description of the experimental procedure. No details are
given about how the extent of reaction was measured.
3. There is a lack of detail in the heat transfer modelling section. Why were fork and row
configurations used? What momentum transport and heat transfer models were used in the
software? Was a grid independence study carried out?
4. There is a lack of detail in the Aspen+ model. How were the thermodynamic properties and
vapour liquid equilibrium calculated? What type of reactor was used (it appears to be a
conversion reactor but no conversion is given)?
These deficiencies in the investigation prevent me from having any confidence in the results and
the results presented in the paper do not support the statements made in in the summary.
This paper requires major revision to be acceptable.

The author’s paper is more substantial after revision. However, some crucial questions still
existed. So I think your paper needs to be further revised.
1. Generally, the ship diesel engine flue gas speed is proportional to the size of the ship. The
author's ammonia system is based on low gas velocity flue gas, so the size of the ship is relatively
small. Due to the hull size, the size of the ammonia system must be taken into account.
2. Compared to the urea for ammonia system, the author’s ammonia system is larger and more
complex. Additionally, the price ammonium bicarbonate is not much cheaper than urea. As
shown in section 2.1, the flue gas produced by the marine diesel engine is sufficient to supply
urea decomposition. What is the advantage of the donor system for ammonia?
3. The author of the ammonia system there is a more complex heat transfer network, which leads
to more heat loss. Marine diesel flue gas temperature range of 220-450 degrees, ammonia system
can guarantee the efficiency of denitrification when the normal work?

Point-by-Point Responses to the Reviewer’s Comments
Please note that all the changes have been made in the revised manuscript highlighted
with Yellow Colour for the reviewer’s attention. I really appreciate the reviewer’s
comments. According to your advice, I have revised my paper earnestly and thoroughly.
And the point-by-point responses have been shown as follows.
Reviewers’ Comments
Reviewer #1:
The authors considered the method for producing ammonia gas with ammonium
bicarbonate. It well known that Carbon dioxide and ammonia can dissolve into
water and then form Ammonium bicarbonate, Therefore, this producing ammonia
gas method is Infeasible.
Response:
Thanks for the reviewer’s comment. Generally, carbon dioxide and ammonia can
dissolve into water and then form ammonium bicarbonate. However, the rate of
ammonia dissolution in water is much higher than that of carbon dioxide in water, all of
the ammonia and a small amount of carbon dioxide will dissolve, and a large amount of
carbon dioxide will be discharged. In this way, large amounts of carbon dioxide are
removed to achieve carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore, this approach is not absolutely
infeasible as the reviewer says.
Reviewer #2:
The authors developed a novel reducing agent bicarbonate for the SCR system and
they designed a kind of hydrolysis system for pyrolysis distillation of ammonium
bicarbonate solution for SCR reaction, which is interesting and creative for the low
speed marine diesel system. Several comments as follows:
1. The authors should compare the new reducing agent with the traditional
materials such as urea, is there any difference of the efficiency?
2. Compare with bicarbonate , ammonium carbonate contain more NH3 per
molecular, why not use ammonium carbonate?
Response:
Thanks for the reviewer’s comment. The traditional material urea, which is used in
traditional denitrification, has high ammonia content and less carbon dioxide in its
product. In addition, the urea solution is injected into the flue gas channel, using flue
gas heat decomposition of ammonia, which application mode is used in denitrification
reaction. The new system proposed in this paper is for low-speed marine diesel engines,
and the temperature of its flue gas is low enough to decompose urea, so the ammonia
storage material selects ammonium bicarbonate instead of urea. But there is more
carbon dioxide in the products of ammonium bicarbonate, and the products directly into
the flue gas pipeline affect the efficiency of denitrification reaction. So the carbon
dioxide separation step of the ammonium bicarbonate thermal decomposition product is
carried out before injected into the flue gas channel.
Tab.1 Comparison of two reducing agents

storage of ammonia chemical quality ammonia temperature different temperatures[1]
formula g/mol mol/mol <U+2103> 200<U+2103> 300<U+2103> 400<U+2103>
urea (NH)2CO 60.07 2 140 18 55 90
ammonium bicarbonate NH4HCO3 79.06 1 60 22 65 90
As the new system process proposed in this paper is different from the traditional
denitrification system used by urea, and the thermal decomposition temperature of
ammonium bicarbonate and urea does not overlap. So that the two reducing agents, the
traditional materials urea and ammonium bicarbonate, can not be compared under the
same conditions. This paper is intended to describe this new system and describes the
work in the system detail design.
Compared to ammonium bicarbonate, ammonium carbonate can spontaneously
decompose into ammonium bicarbonate and ammonia, thus any initially pure sample of
ammonium carbonate will soon become a mixture including various by products [2].
Because of the instability of the above-mentioned, ammonium bicarbonate is selected
instead of ammonia carbonate.
Reviewer #3:
This paper investigates on an ammonia supply system for flue gas denitrification of
low speed marine diesel. Typically, NOx in the flue gas are reduced by ammonia.
For safety reasons, ammonia is released from the decomposition of a precursor.
The authors have preferentially selected ammonium bicarbonate instead of urea
because this component is cheaper with thermal decomposition starting at lower
temperature. This study proposes a modelling study to optimize heat transfer
occurring in the different steps involved in the thermal decomposition of
ammonium bicarbonate and the production of ammonia.
Despite this study is original and can provide new information, this paper is
difficult to read and cannot be accepted in this form. Indeed, some clarifications
are needed avoiding an important dilution in the writing which harms in the global
understanding of the study and these objectives.
Finally, an important aspect is likely related to the presence of impurities in the
inlet flow of ammonia and the consequences on the SCR process. I suggest the
authors to submit a more concise paper which focuses on the most important
information compared to previous reported data and/or already published.
All the symbols used should be included in a separate section in an annex.
Response:
Thanks for the reviewer’s comment. The traditional material urea, which is used in
traditional denitrification, has high ammonia content and less carbon dioxide in its

and the temperature of its flue gas is low enough to decompose urea, so the ammonia
storage material selects ammonium bicarbonate instead of urea. But there is more

P. 4-5 – The description of the physicochemical processes occurring in the
installation should be written more concisely including the heat consumed or
released for each steps if possible. Indeed, this presentation is purely qualitative.
Eventually, this part could be included in the introduction section.
Response:
Thanks for the reviewer’s comment. The description of the physicochemical processes
occurring in the installation has been modified as follows:
The ammonia supply system mainly consists of the follows components:
<U+F09F> Heat transfer oil circulation system
<U+F09F> Ammonium bicarbonate thermal decomposition system
<U+F09F> Separation of carbon dioxide system
<U+F09F> Catalytic reduction step of ammonia with NOx
In the heat transfer oil circulation system, the oil is first heated by the exhaust heat
of flue gas, then pumped into the ammonium bicarbonate thermal decomposition
chamber and the ammonia evaporator. The output of the heat exchanger is calculated as
follows [21]:
H <U+F028> t1 <U+F02D> t 2 <U+F029>
E1 <U+F03D> <U+03BB> (1)
d
The heat supplied by the hot oil is calculated as follows:
E2 <U+F03D> q <U+F028> t b1 -t b2 <U+F029> e (2)
In the ammonium bicarbonate thermal decomposition system, ammonium
bicarbonate is dissolved in the ammonium bicarbonate solution chamber, and then
pumped into the ammonium bicarbonate thermal decomposition chamber. The
ammonium bicarbonate is decomposed by absorbing the heat from hot oil, the gases,
carbon dioxide, ammonia and some water vapor, which are produced by the ammonium
bicarbonate thermal decomposition. The chemical reaction is shown as follows:
NH4 HCO3 <U+F028> aq <U+F029> <U+F0AE> NH3 <U+F028> aq <U+F029> +CO2 <U+F028> g <U+F029> +H2O,<U+F044>H=64.87 kJ mol (3)
After thermal decomposition, dilute solution is pumped into the solution chamber
to continue dissolving ammonium bicarbonate.
In the process of separating the carbon dioxide system, the gases produced by
thermal decomposition chamber is pumped into the absorber. Due to the high reaction
rate of the ammonia and the carbon dioxide with water, ammonia vapor all dissolved
rapidly, and only small amount of carbon dioxide will be dissolved, with most of the
carbon dioxide discharged from the absorber. Therefore, carbon dioxide can be
separated from mixed gases. Because of fully dissolved ammonia gas, concentrated
ammonia solution in absorber is pumped into the evaporator. Ammonia gas is desorbed
by absorbed heat from hot oil in the evaporator. After evaporated, dilute ammonia
solution is pumped into cooler to be cooled, and then pumped in absorber to absorb
ammonia gas. Ammonia gas desorbed in absorber is pumped in the ammonia gas tank.
Thereby carbon dioxide is separated by the system between absorber, the evaporator and
the cooler. The relevant chemical reactions are as follows:

NH3 <U+F028> g <U+F029> +H2 O <U+F028> l <U+F029> <U+F0AE> NH4 OH <U+F028> aq <U+F029>,<U+F044>H= - 34.748kJ/mol (4)

In the catalytic reduction step of ammonia with NOx, the ammonia in the gas tank
is injected into the diesel flue gas through the nozzle. The ammonia and flue gas are
mixed with mixer, and then enter the SCR reactor. Under the action of the catalyst,
ammonia reacts with NOx to produce harmless gases N2. The relevant chemical
reactions are as follows:
4NH3 <U+F028> g <U+F029> +4NO <U+F028> g <U+F029> +O2 <U+F028> g <U+F029> <U+F0AE> 4N2 <U+F028> g <U+F029> +6H2 O(g),<U+F044>H=-1627.2kJ/mol (6)

The working condition of the ammonia supply system can be calculated by the
reaction equations listed in this section.
The name of the steps of reaction (4) and (5) is unclear at least for reaction (5)
which does not match with a desorption step. The physical state of the different
components should be specified.

Reviewer #4:
This paper describes a system to decrease the NOx concentration in marine diesel
engine flue gases using ammonia. Due to the hazards posed by storing liquid
ammonia it is proposed to make it on the ship using ammonium carbonate and
waste heat from the ships engines. This paper presents an investigation of the
technical feasibility of the process system required to do this. Unfortunately it fails
in its objectives for a number of reasons.
1. The description of the process system is very poor and I could only work out
what was going on by using the diagram and referring to other sources.
2. There is a lack of detail in the experimental section, with no justification being
given for the range of variables used and a very poor description of the
experimental procedure. No details are given about how the extent of reaction was
measured.
Response:
Thanks for the reviewer’s comment.Uncertainty analysis of the experimental data as
follow:
Temperature. The temperature of the hot water and the solution are measured by
the K-type thermocouples,and the output signals are collected by the ADAM4118
temperature measurement module. Their errors are 0.75% and 0.1%, respectively, so the
uncertainty is:
<U+F064>t

3. There is a lack of detail in the heat transfer modelling section. Why were fork
and row configurations used? What momentum transport and heat transfer
models were used in the software? Was a grid independence study carried out?
Response:
Thanks for the reviewer’s comment. Corresponding changes are as follows:

It can be seen from Fig. 1 that when the number of grids reaches 986511, the cold
outlet temperature changes little at the same hot inlet temperature as the number of grids
increases, satisfying the accuracy requirements of the simulation results. To improve the
efficiency of the calculation, take the number of grids 986511, start the subsequent
calculation process.
4. There is a lack of detail in the Aspen+ model. How were the thermodynamic
properties and vapour liquid equilibrium calculated? What type of reactor was
used (it appears to be a conversion reactor but no conversion is given)?

Thanks for the reviewer’s comment. Corresponding changes are as follows:

Appendix B
Point-by-Point Responses to the Reviewer’s Comments
Please note that all the changes have been made in the revised manuscript highlighted
with Yellow Color for the reviewer’s attention. I really appreciate the reviewer’s
comments. According to your advice, I have revised my paper earnestly and thoroughly.
And the point-by-point responses have been shown as follows.
Reviewers’ Comments
Reviewer #1:
Comments to the Author(s)
The author’s paper is more substantial after revision. However, some crucial
questions still existed. So I think your paper needs to be further revised.
1. Generally, the ship diesel engine flue gas speed is proportional to the size of
the ship. The author's ammonia system is based on low gas velocity flue gas, so the
size of the ship is relatively small. Due to the hull size, the size of the ammonia
system must be taken into account.
Response:
Thanks for the reviewer’s comment. The ammonia supply system proposed in the paper
is for flue gas denitrification of low speed marine diesel. However, the ‘low-speed’ of
marine diesel engines are not the ship diesel engine flue gas speed, but the engines
rotating speed. Low-speed diesel engines are mostly two-stroke machine, and are
basically used in large-scale ship. In addition, the size of the ammonia supply system
is much smaller, compared to the ships of low-speed two-stroke marine diesel engines.
For example, the following is a large marine low speed diesel engine, model
Wartsila-Sulzer_RTA96-C.
The parameter data for model Wartsila-Sulzer_RTA96-C is as follows: 14
cylinders, single cylinder displacement of 1820 litres, single-cylinder power of 7780
horsepower. 14-cylinder machine power 108,920 horsepower (102rpm). Machine
weighs 2,300 tons. With heavy oil, the thermal efficiency reaches 50% (25% -30% for
a typical car engine). It is 27.3 meters long and 13.5 meters high. The whole machine
weighs 2,300 tons and is suitable for a new generation of large container ships. The
photo of Wartsila-Sulzer_RTA96-C is shown in Fig 1.

2. Compared to the urea for ammonia system, the author’s ammonia system is larger and
more complex. Additionally, the price ammonium bicarbonate is not much cheaper than urea.
As shown in section 2.1, the flue gas produced by the marine diesel engine is sufficient to
supply urea decomposition. What is the advantage of the donor system for ammonia?
Response:
Thanks for the reviewer’s comment. As shown in section 2.1, the given temperature is
only the temperature at which urea and ammonium bicarbonate thermal decomposition
begin. Urea full thermal decomposition temperature is about 190<U+2103>, and residence time
10-30min. Ammonia bicarbonate thermal decomposition temperature is about 86 <U+2103>,
residence time 15-20s. In addition, at the same ammonia production, the thermal
decomposition enthalpy of ammonium bicarbonate is lower than that of urea.
The relevant chemical reactions are as follows:
NH4 HCO3 <U+F028> aq <U+F029> <U+F0AE> NH3 <U+F028> aq <U+F029> +CO2 <U+F028> g <U+F029> +H2O,<U+F044>H=64.87 kJ mol (1)
CO <U+F028> NH2 <U+F029><U+F028> aq <U+F029> <U+F02B> H2 O <U+F028> l <U+F029> <U+F0AE> 2NH3 <U+F028> aq <U+F029> +CO2 <U+F028> g <U+F029>,<U+F044>H=161.5kJ mol (2)
NOx control is the most important issue in marine diesel engine emissions control,
especially in offshore ports. When ships sailing, the diesel engine operates in low
operating conditions, so that the exhaust gas temperature is lower than the normal
operating temperature. Low operating conditions, the temperature required for thermal
decomposition of ammonia bicarbonate more appropriate than urea.
The corresponding changes in the article are as follows:
2.1 Comparison of ammonium bicarbonate with urea
The traditional material urea, which is used in traditional denitrification, has high
ammonia content and less carbon dioxide in its product. In addition, the urea solution
is injected into the flue gas channel, using flue gas heat decomposition of ammonia,
which application mode is used in denitrification reaction. The new system proposed in
this paper is for low-speed marine diesel engines, and the temperature of its flue gas is
low enough to decompose urea, so the ammonia storage material selects ammonium
bicarbonate instead of urea. But there is more carbon dioxide in the pyrolysis products
of ammonium bicarbonate, and the pyrolysis products directly into the flue gas pipeline
affect the efficiency of denitrification reaction. So the carbon dioxide separation step
of the ammonium bicarbonate thermal decomposition product is carried out before
injected into the flue gas channel.

As the new system process proposed in this paper is different from the traditional
denitrification system used by urea, and the thermal decomposition temperature of
ammonium bicarbonate and urea does not overlap. In addition, at the same ammonia
production, the thermal decomposition enthalpy of ammonium bicarbonate is lower
than that of urea.
The relevant chemical reactions are as follows:
NH4 HCO3 <U+F028> aq <U+F029> <U+F0AE> NH3 <U+F028> aq <U+F029> +CO2 <U+F028> g <U+F029> +H2O,<U+F044>H=64.87 kJ mol (8)

NOx control is the most important issue in marine diesel engine emissions control,
especially in offshore ports. When ships sailing, the diesel engine operates in low
operating conditions, so that the exhaust gas temperature is lower than the normal
operating temperature. Low operating conditions, the temperature required for thermal
decomposition of ammonia bicarbonate more appropriate than urea.
This paper is intended to describe this new system and describes the work in the
system detail design.
3. The author of the ammonia system there is a more complex heat transfer network, which
leads to more heat loss. Marine diesel flue gas temperature range of 220-450 degrees, ammonia
system can guarantee the efficiency of denitrification when the normal work?
Response:
Thanks for the reviewer’s comment. This problem really turned out to be ignored,
thank you to the reviewer for letting us revisit this aspect. The solution is that putting
the flue gas heat exchanger after SCR reactor, let the flue gas pass through the SCR
reactor first and then use the flue gas to heat the heat transfer oil. As shown before,
ammonia bicarbonate thermal decomposition temperature is about 86 <U+2103> , so the
temperature of heat transfer oil is enough for ammonia bicarbonate thermal
decomposition.
The corresponding changes in the article are as follows:
