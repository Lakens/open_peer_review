Title:
It is recommended to change the title into “Determination of donepezil in spiked rabbit plasma
by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection”
Abstract
Page 1=Line 35: it was preferable to make the validation according to the bioanalytical validation
guidelines of FDA rather than ICH
Page 1=Line 47: please omit the last sentence “Moreover, the stability……” as it is one parameter
of the validation method.
Introduction
Page 2=Line 22: Reference number 2 developed HPLC method with fluorescence detection as in
your topics, it is preferable to enumerate the advantages of your proposed method over the
reported one, for example, sensitivity, a range of quantitation, applicability to plasma, ……….
Page 2=Line 30: the cost of CE is comparable to HPLC and even cheaper than HPLC, however,
CE coupled to mass is more expensive. Please revise the phrase.
Experimental
Page 4=Line 40: You should insert additional subtitle preparation of biological sample
“preparation of rabbit plasma”
Page 5=Line 39, Section 2.5.1: “pH was adjusted to 10 …….” The question is adjusted by what
and why??
Page 5=Line 42 to 45, Section 2.5.1: from the analytical point of view, something is wrong, please
carefully revise.
Page 5=Line 12 to 25, Section 2.5.2: please revise the written paragraph to be exactly matched
with the schematic presentation. Page 5=Line 23: please change “nitrogen steam” into a stream of
nitrogen
Page 8=Line 22, Section 3.1.3.: the appropriate selection of IS depends on the similarity of the
chemical and physicochemical similarities between the drug of interest and IS to enhance the
extraction procedures and to improve the accuracy the recovery, please revise the phrases.
Page 10=Line 28, Section 3.2: as mentioned before: it was preferable to make the validation
according to the bioanalytical validation guidelines of FDA rather than ICH
Page 11=Figure 5: it is supposed that the response of the IS is 20 to 25% the response of the
highest analyte concentration and scale of the y-axis represents the analyte to IS peak area ratios.
Therefore, the y-axis under any conditions should not exceed 5 unit, I do not know why the scale
reached to 120. Please revise.
Page 11=Line 36, Section 3.2.2: you are working with chromatography, it is better to calculate the
LOD and LOQ on the base of signal-to-noise ration rather than intercept of the linear regression
equation
Page 15=Table 6: please insert the reference of the reported method

The manuscript describes a method with fluorescence detection for estimation of donepezil (DZ)
in rabbit plasma using silodosin as internal standard in therms of selectivity, sensitivity, precision
and stability. Many experimental data were presented in the manuscript, however there are still
some points that need to be explained by the authors:
1. In the introduction the alternative methods were mentioned [2-8], however not enough to
explain the advantage by using this alternative method. The references should be increased and a
comparison table should be useful, regarding parameters of repeatability, sensitivity,
LOD&LOQ, price and accessibility of the methods.
2. In the graphics, the labels of the coordinates are too small (time and counts)
3. what are the advantages and disadvantages of the method (conclusion section)
4. what is the detection time of the experiment. There can be some sections that can be optimized?
(manual shaking)
5. what it would be the clinical validity prediction of the method
6. It would be possible for the interference results with others compounds?

Comparison of the proposed method with the reported methods
was summarized in page 2 and page 23 (Table 8).

Done as requested in all graphs.
3- What are the advantages and disadvantages of the method
(conclusion section)
Done as requested in conclusion part (page 23).

supported by corresponding graphs (in supplementary material).
5- What it would be the clinical validity prediction of the method?
Mentioned in section conclusion part (page 23).
6- It would be possible for the interference results with others
