Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper, I enjoyed reading it. The introduction proved
a clear rationale for the current study and a very accessible synthesis of background information.
The methods are clearly stated, and results appropriately presented.
My only concern is the conclusion that there is evidence for a "shift in internal morphology with
<u>each subsequent generation in captivity</u>". My reading of the study does indeed show a
change in generation f5, but given that this was only one generation for which the result was
found, i feel that this is perhaps an overstatement. I would perhaps temper this conclusion to
better reflect the constraints of the current study.
Similarly, in abstract the following statement "Our findings demonstrate that captive breeding
can alter their internal morphology, and these morphological changes may have MAJOR
IMPACTS on organismal functioning and viability." also seems to be drawing a long bow, when
function was not assessed in any way. Again, I would modify this statement.
Other than that, a potential typographical error:
abstract L28 "...can alter THEIR internal morphology..." "their" seems unnecessary in sentence.

I believe that this is a very well-written ms and that the authors have done an excellent job in
presenting their work. I do not have any specific comments for clarity or improvement, but I have
a couple of general comments that I hope will be helpful.
1. It isn't clear to me that the few changes in internal morphology, compared to the many features
external and internal that did not change, warrant the conclusion that the findings indicate a
significant biological result. In other words, couldn't the case be made, perhaps more easily, that
this study demonstrates remarkable consistency in morphology between wild and captive
populations?
2. I believe that the authors could strengthen the argument that the observed change is
biologically relevant by demonstrating more directionality of change in the traits with additional
generations. I realize that this is likely not possible in the current study, in which case I would
soften the conclusions and broaden the Discussion on alternative possibilities that could have
produced the results.

Dear Prof. Kevin Padian,
Thank you for the opportunity to submit a revised version of our manuscript considered for publication in Royal
Society Open Science – Biology (Whole Organism): “Effect of captivity on morphology: negligible changes in
external morphology mask significant changes in internal morphology.” by Stephanie Courtney Jones and co-
authors.
We are grateful for your comments and those of the two reviewers. We have revised the manuscript in line with
these comments and our detailed responses are attached. The two main recommendations were to: 1) temper the
findings of the study in relation to the transgenerational effects in captivity; and 2) clarify the impacts of
morphological change on individuals. In regard to the first recommendation, we have revised sections of the
manuscript to address the constraints of the study adding additional text to the discussion and tempering the
conclusions so as to avoid overstating the findings, and to address the limitations of our findings on
transgenerational effects. In regard to the second recommendation, we have now tempered our conclusions on
transgenerational effects. We would like to thank the editor and reviewers for providing such valuable comments
and suggestions to improve the manuscript.
As requested, we have provided detailed responses to each of the reviewer’s comments, and, for ease of
reference, we have referred to line numbers in the original and revised paper. Changes to the manuscript have
been highlighted in using the track changes mode in MS word as requested.
Please note that the word count for the manuscript is 5,491 words, the content of the paper is original research
and has not been published or submitted for publication elsewhere, that its submission for publication has been
approved by all author’s and institutions, and that all authors have seen and agreed to the submitted revised
version of the manuscript. The revised manuscript contains the following sections: ethics statement, data
accessibility, competing interests, author contributions, acknowledgements and funding statement before the
reference list. Further, all sources of funding are acknowledged in the manuscript, and authors have declared any
direct financial benefits that could result from publication and all appropriate ethics and other approvals were
obtained for the research. We hope that the manuscript is now suitable for publication in Royal Society Open
Science.
Yours sincerely,
Stephanie K. Courtney Jones and co-authors.
Comments to the Author(s)
Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper, I enjoyed reading it. The introduction proved a clear rationale
for the current study and a very accessible synthesis of background information. The methods are clearly stated,
and results appropriately presented.
My only concern is the conclusion that there is evidence for a "shift in internal morphology with <u>each
subsequent generation in captivity</u>". My reading of the study does indeed show a change in generation f5,
but given that this was only one generation for which the result was found, I feel that this is perhaps an
overstatement. I would perhaps temper this conclusion to better reflect the constraints of the current study.
Response: We thank the reviewer for making this valid comment, to address this, we have tempered the
conclusion to reflect the constraints of this study. It has been amended as follows:
“This study aimed to investigate whether morphology differed between captive-reared and wild-caught
individuals, the effect of captivity on external and internal morphology across generations and whether the sexes
responded differently to the captive-rearing environment. The absence of changes to external morphology
masked internal morphological changes. Moreover, there was evidence for a shift in internal morphology across
one generation in captivity. It was found that morphology significantly differed depending on sex, and that sex-
based morphological differences were maintained in the captive rearing environment. Identifying the magnitude
and direction of morphological changes in captivity is an important first step towards developing and refining
methodologies to minimise unfavourable phenotypic changes in captivity. In turn, this knowledge may be used to
improve captive breeding and reintroduction programmes. Overall, these findings draw attention to the need to
consider the potential for both internal and external morphological changes when developing methods to
improve CBPs and reintroduction programmes.”
See lines: 479 – 491.
Similarly, in abstract the following statement "Our findings demonstrate that captive breeding can alter their
internal morphology, and these morphological changes may have MAJOR IMPACTS on organismal functioning
and viability." also seems to be drawing a long bow, when function was not assessed in any way. Again, I would
modify this statement.
Response: We thank the reviewer for making this valid comment, to address this, we have tempered this sentence
as follows: “Our findings demonstrate that captive breeding can alter internal morphology. Given that these
morphological changes may impact organismal functioning and viability following release, further investigation
is warranted. If the morphological change is shown to be maladaptive, these changes would have significant
implications for captive-source populations that are used for reintroduction including reduced survivorship.”
See lines: 26 – 31.
Other than that, a potential typographical error:
abstract L28 "...can alter THEIR internal morphology..." "their" seems unnecessary in sentence.
Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing out this error, it has now been amended.

Comments to the Author(s)
I believe that this is a very well-written ms and that the authors have done an excellent job in presenting their
work. I do not have any specific comments for clarity or improvement, but I have a couple of general comments
that I hope will be helpful.
1. It isn't clear to me that the few changes in internal morphology, compared to the many features external and
internal that did not change, warrant the conclusion that the findings indicate a significant biological result. In
other words, couldn't the case be made, perhaps more easily, that this study demonstrates remarkable consistency
in morphology between wild and captive populations?
Response: We thank the reviewer for this valid comment and for highlighting this lack of development in our
arguments for why some but not all traits changed in captivity. We agree that not all traits will change in
captivity or may not apparent within a short number of generations in captivity. We now include a paragraph
that acknowledges that not all traits may change in captivity and provide reasoning as to why this may have
occurred. We have amended the section of the discussion as follows: “In the present study, the absence of
changes in external morphology masked internal morphological changes. Specifically, combined kidney and
spleen mass were lighter in captive-reared individuals compared with wild-caught individuals. The finding that
some but not all internal morphological traits changed in captivity (i.e. some traits displayed remarkable
consistency between wild and captive populations) may have occurred because not all traits significantly impact
individual fitness in the captive environment (McPhee 2004). This could relax selection pressure for trait change.
Alternatively, widespread changes in morphology may require multiple generations to manifest because
individual traits differ in how quickly they respond to change. To test this, and demonstrate both the speed and
directionality of change, and that changes are biologically relevant, it would be necessary to track changes over
additional generations.”
See lines: 367 – 377.
2. I believe that the authors could strengthen the argument that the observed change is biologically relevant by
demonstrating more directionality of change in the traits with additional generations. I realize that this is likely
not possible in the current study, in which case I would soften the conclusions and broaden the Discussion on
alternative possibilities that could have produced the results.
Response: We thank the reviewer for this valid comment and agree that to demonstrate the speed and directional
change in morphology would require additional generations in captivity. While this was not possible in this
present study, we have acknowledged this limitation of the study within the discussion and have tempered the
conclusions to account for this constraint in the experiment.
“In the present study, the absence of changes in external morphology masked internal morphological changes.
