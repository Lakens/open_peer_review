The manuscript describes the preparation of new polyimides containing a lateral pyridine
moiety. Another interesting point is that they describe the process to obtain the polyimides by a
microwave aided reaction in one step reaction process. The manuscript is appropriate and fairly
written, the characterization of the as prepared monomer and polymers is properly done. I
believe it provides new insight in the possibility of a cleaner and faster process for highly
aromatic polyimides preparation. There are only a few minor details that that should be fixed:
In page 5 line 23, they should give the power of the microwave unit used. The same maker
provides different powers.
In the thermal properties page 6 line 22 Figure 5. Storage modulus for PyDMP-ODPA present a
unstable transition at around 250 C and also at 350. I this an unstable behavior of the sample or is
it that there is some solvent left that is leaving the sample at the start of the transition? They
should clarify the point.
In Figure 6, page 7 line 15, All TGA thermograms show a weight loss, around 2% at around 250
C. they should explain where this weight loss.

This manuscript reported that optical transparent and soluble polyimide films containing pyridyl
side units have been prepared. The chemical structure and various physical and optical
3
transparency properties of the polymers were clearly characterized. Thus, I think this manuscript
can be accepted after revision and double-checking the grammars of the whole manuscript.
1. There are many grammatical mistakes through the whole manuscript. For example, On Line 36
of Page 1, “modified PIs” should be “modify PIs”; on Line 11 of Page 2, the sentence “which may
be due to that…” is not correct; on Line 20 of Page 2, “abstacle” is a noun, not verb. Figure 1,
“spectra” should be “spectrum”.
2. On page 5, “Figure 1” should be “Figure 4”.
3. Some conclusions were not fully reliable. For example, “Although they reported close data of
inherent viscosities, we think our PIs by microwave radiation should have higher molecular
weights” there was no direct data to support it.
4. It is not very reasonable that the discussion part about XRD was placed behind the parts
involving polymeric thermal, mechanical and other properties.

manuscript is appropriate and fairly written, the characterization of the as prepared
monomer and polymers is properly done. I believe it provides new insight in the
possibility of a cleaner and faster process for highly aromatic polyimides preparation.
There are only a few minor details that that should be fixed:
Response: We would like to thank the Referee #1 for her/his positive reviews.
Other comments:
(1) In page 5 line 23, they should give the power of the microwave unit used. The
same maker provides different powers.
-- According to the suggestion of the reviewer, we added the microwave power on
page 5 as shown below.
(2) In the thermal properties page 6 line 22 Figure 5. Storage modulus for
PyDMP-ODPA present a unstable transition at around 250 C and also at 350. I this an
unstable behavior of the sample or is it that there is some solvent left that is leaving
the sample at the start of the transition? They should clarify the point.
-- Thanks the referee very much. According to the suggestion of the reviewer, we
retested this sample and found that the transition at around 250 C disappeared this
time. So we think the transition at around 250 C was originated from the unstable
instrument at that time. The new DMA traces were showed below. The storage
modulus of PyDPM-ODPA was smoothly decreases before 220 °C, and then slightly
increases at 250 °C, which could be ascribed to the further imidization.
(3) In Figure 6, page 7 line 15, All TGA thermograms show a weight loss, around 2%
at around 250 C. they should explain where this weight loss.
-- According to the suggestion of the reviewer, we checked the TGA data and found
all the PIs showed less than 0.5% weight loss at 250 °C. This may be related to the
membrane preparation process. In order to get a colorless or light color film, we only
thermally baked in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h and 200 °C for 12 h to remove the
solvent. So we think the weight loss may be ascribed to a small amount of moisture
absorption, especially the residual solvent.

the sentence “which may be due to that…” is not correct; on Line 20 of Page 2,
“abstacle” is a noun, not verb. Figure 1, “spectra” should be “spectrum”.
-- According to the suggestion of the reviewer, we have corrected over 20
grammatical mistakes of the manuscript. Please check the highlighted manuscript.
(2) On page 5, “Figure 1” should be “Figure 4”.
-- Actually, we checked 1H NMR spectra of PyDPM and PyDPM-BPDA and found
nothing wrong with Figure 1 and Figure 4.
(3) Some conclusions were not fully reliable. For example, “Although they reported
close data of inherent viscosities, we think our PIs by microwave radiation should
have higher molecular weights” there was no direct data to support it.
-- According to the suggestion of the reviewer, we deleted this sentence. Furthermore,
we also checked the other related conclusions to assure that they are reliable enough.
(4) It is not very reasonable that the discussion part about XRD was placed behind the
parts involving polymeric thermal, mechanical and other properties.
-- According to the suggestion of the reviewer, we placed the XRD discussion ahead
of thermal properties.
