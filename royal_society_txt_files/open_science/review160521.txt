The manuscript deals with the effect of forest structure on the relationship between tree species
diversity and stand productivity. It relies on the use of a gap model (FORMIND3.0) and a specific
procedure for stand initialization called “Forest Factory”. The main message is that density and
height heterogeneity have a large influence on productivity (in their case study, greater than the
effect of species richness and functional diversity) and that the relationship between diversity and
productivity depends on stand structure. This topic is highly interesting and highly relevant.
Although based on a static perspective, the fact that population or community size structure
modifies significantly the effect of diversity on productivity is of major interest for plant
ecologists. This is also a complex issue and the authors tackled it quite well. Moreover, the
authors brought important modifications to comply with reviewers’ comments. I have however
several concerns about the analysis itself, the structure of the paper and the way the topic is
presented.
First, the structure of the paper is quite unusual and could be a bit clarified. The analysis of
underlying mechanisms (see pages 8-9) should be introduced in the method as the interest of this
analysis does not really depend on the results obtained for the effect of species diversity on
productivity. Of course, such a modification would imply to better integrate mechanisms in the
introduction and the results sections.
The introduction is quite general and doesn’t provide any clear hypotheses about the potential
effects of structural attributes on productivity. For instance, the important positive effect of basal
area on productivity is well-known. That is why many authors consider density (Zeide 2005) as
different from forest structure (see for instance Pommerening 2002). In the same vein, several
recent articles found negative effects of size heterogeneity in monospecific stands (e.g. Bourdier et
al. 2016) and one recent study (Danescu et al. 2016) revealed positive effects of size heterogeneity
(and species diversity) in mixed stands (in Germany). These studies already indicate that the
effect of size heterogeneity on productivity can be significant in both monocultures and mixed
stands. I think the authors could thus better inform the reader about these effects and try to be
more specific when presenting their hypotheses. This would also help the authors to clarify their
discussion. For instance, the authors don’t discuss thoroughly the mechanisms that could explain
the negative effect of size heterogeneity on productivity. Finally, the idea of comparing
mechanisms (see Bauhus and Forrester 2016 for a review of processes) is interesting.
Unfortunately, it is not mentioned in the questions of the introduction.
I have two concerns about the analysis. First, the authors don’t consider mean size or succession
stage to control for the diversity and the size heterogeneity effects. The authors justified this
choice by the fact that basal area and mean height are correlated in their data. I think this is a
problem and not a justification. It means that the effect of basal area and mean size are
confounded and that the author cannot separate them with their constructed data set. This is a
pity as, according to figure 1, tree height has a major effect on tree growth efficiency (see next
paragraph). I think it should be at least discussed (see Lasky et al. 2013, Zhang et al. 2012).
Second, and most importantly, the fact that the Factory Model selects species according to their
ability to have positive growth under shade means that relative abundances of species within a
mixture can vary with density and size heterogeneity. I think it is important that the author try to
control for this effect.
I was not convinced by the validation section. The fact that climate data used for simulations is
different from climate experienced by inventory plots appears problematic. However, I think that
the comparisons of results obtained for simulations and empirical data is more interesting and
more relevant. It shows that results are coherent using different approaches (empirical data,
simulations). I suggest the authors focus more on this comparison.
3
In the main text, we lack some justifications for several important choices made by the authors
(the reader has to read appendix files very carefully to understand these choices). Why do the
authors standardise (normalise?) tree productivity according to tree crown area (page 4 line 10)?
Why do you sum these values at the stand scale? Why is the maximum diameter value set to
50cm (a low value for a temperate forest)?
I have read carefully the Appendix files. There are too many language mistakes (see corrections
in the attached files). It is important that the authors explain on which basis they define their 15
stand structures (empirical data?) as some diameter distributions appear highly unrealistic (e.g.
stand 15). I didn’t get what rule 1 consists of (how does it work?). Figure A4 (Appendix A): these
graphs are of major importance for your results. They indicate that height of the trees impact tree
growth efficiency (growth per unit of crown area). If I understand correctly, small and large trees
are less efficient for all species (for Hainich environmental conditions). Is this pattern (which is
important for your study) really supported by empirical studies? I was surprised by some values:
for instance, your model predicts that small beech trees (a shade tolerant species) cannot grow
when they receive less than 80% of available light at the top of their crown. Such a value appears
very high.
Figure 2 is difficult to read (even with subsamples). I suggest the authors provide the distribution
of plots for each number of species in separate graphs (in a supplementary material).
The number of inventory plots varies in your text: 2418 page 6 and 2415 page 7

The authors explore the relationship between tree biodiversity and productivity of forests using a
simulation modelling approach. They create a large number of forest stands in silico, each of
which has a realistic stem-size distribution and is comprised of randomly generated mixtures of
species. They then use a well-known spatially-explicit size-structured forest model within which
trees compete with one another for light depending on the relative size, position and foliar
density of their crowns. This model is used to calculate the annual aboveground woody growth
of each constituent stem, and thence the above-ground wood production (AWP) of the whole
stand. The authors repeat this exercise for almost 400,000 stands, and then explore the
covariance between species richness and AWP estimates in these simulations. They find that
forest structure (i.e. basal area and height heterogeneity) have a very strong influence on AWP,
and that the productivity-biodiversity effect is small and contingent upon forest structure.
This is an exciting piece of research, underpinned by very substantial computational work, that
elegantly complements (and to some extent challenges) observational studies based on repeated
measurements made in inventory plots. The journal has provided me with responses to
previous reviews. I see that the authors have added new sections exploring “underlying
mechanism” and “validation” of the simulations. I found the new mechanistic section of
particular interest.
I found the science compelling, but I would encourage the authors to focus on restructuring the
text, in order that the paper gets the positive attention that it deserves. My comments below are
aimed at improving the flow and wording of the manuscript. I have just two scientific points to
raise:
(a) Assumption iii included in the new section on page 9 got me thinking! The authors simulate
stands in which the species identity of stems is initially random, but it light demanding trees (e.g.
birch) have been placed beneath a dense canopy then the simulator will calculate that they have
negative growth rates. Instead of using these negative growth rates when calculating AWP, the
authors have instead replaced the offending stems by species that are more shade tolerant.
Whilst this make sense in terms of re-creating realistic forests, this step is in effect replicating
successional processes inside the simulator: it’s increasing the likelihood of complementarity
effects in old-growth forests (i.e. those with high BA and low height heterogeneity). I haven’t
thought through the consequence of this, but I suggest that it’s considered more explicitly in the
discussion
(b) Please would the authors provide a slightly longer explanation of the inner workings of
FORMIND in the text (for those unwilling wade through lengthy SI sections) and particularly its
main assumptions. I think it assumes that all plant “traits” including light-response curves for
photosynthesis and respiration, allocation and allometry are invariant of the competitive
environment a tree is found in. I’m not unhappy about these assumptions – a line must be drawn
somewhere! – but feel that readers would benefit from having all this information in one place.
“Minor” comments.
The summary contains numerous grammatical errors. Please check this particularly carefully, as
many readers never get beyond the summary!

Page 7 Line 26. Might I suggest replacing “horizontal tree density measures (basal area)” with
“basal area”? In my view, basal area isn’t a good measure of tree density!
Page 7 Line 21 “We compiled a large set of forest stands by using a new forest modelling
approach, which we refer to as the forest factory approach”. I think “simulated a large set of
forest stands by randomising species identities” would be a better word than “compiled” here.
Page 7 Line 32. “For every forest stand, we measure productivity as above ground wood
production per hectare for one year (AWP) using a process-based forest gap model”. Consider
writing “we estimate the wood production of every tree in the stand using physiological
relationships encoded in a process-based forest gap model (FORMIND) and then estimate
instantaneous aboveground wood production by summing the wood production of all trees in
the simulated stands”. I’ve included “instantaneous” here because your model isn’t accounting
for mortality, so will give a high AWP than measured in permanent plots ( see papers by
Coomes et al http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12622/abstract and Jucker et al.
2016 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.2175/pdf for similar approach being
used in permanent plots, with some discussion on the subject)
Page 7 Line 36. Please define “canopy structure” at this point or even before.
Page 8: Consider including a nice explanatory figure here.
Page 8 Line 11: “These species vary by allometry parameterisation, productivity and responses to
climatic patterns”…. Suggest… “These species vary markedly in SHADE TOLERANCE (key to
you finding any effect of biodiversity using your modelling approach), allometry, productivity
and responses to climate”
Page 8 Line 20: Again I suggest “estimate” instead of “measure” as you’re not going out and
measuring things, you’re estimating them from a complex model.
Page 8 Line 23: “The model considers establishment, 2 mortality, competition and growth
processes.” I suggest “The model simulates the establishment, mortality, growth processes of
trees that are competing for light”
Page 8 Line 34 “as a proxy year for a typical climate regime of the temperate zone” suggest
“which has a temperate climate” [ i.e. no need to assert this study necessarily applies elsewhere
]
Page 9 Line 12: is it really “per area” for AGBtree ?
Page 10 “Only the structure class with a high BA and high T contains forest stands with a
maximum of seven species” … please follow this line through by stating why.
Page 11 The authors should be praised for their efforts to compare modelling predictions with
field measurements, but I don’t think that comparisons with inventory datasets should be
described as “validation”. My suggestion would be that the eddy flux measurements are left
where they are – simply mentioned in the methods as “validation” of the ecophysiological
modelling approach. In my mind they’re contributing very little to the biodiversity issues that
are central to the paper. I would suggest that comparisons with inventory datasets are given
more prominence throughout the paper, as it’s now a selling point. Ps. it’s a great pity that the
figures pertaining to the inventory results are tucked away in appendices. I’d love to see them in
the main body of the text.
Page 11 Up to you, but I suggest “Comparisons with field datasets” rather than “validation”
here.
Page 12 Line 10 “Second”…. Please make clearer what “First” is in the previous paragraph
Page 12 Line 20 … There’s a tremendous amount of fascinating stuff summarised in this one
paragraph! I suggest you describe your findings in a little more detail
Page 12 Line 32… isn’t it 379,000 stands? That’s quite a lot more than 300,000
Page 13 Line 26. Again, do you need to use basal area as a proxy for stem density? Why not just
stick with basal area as a measure of “forest structure”? In self thinning stands, the two
variables are strongly negatively correlated!
Page 13: Underlying mechanisms. There are several really neat ideas in this new section. To my
mind, it’s this section that really lifts the paper to a high standard. But it’s not very tightly
written at present, and it feels “tacked on” to the original manuscript rather than being
integrated into it. I’d encourage the authors to include reference to this section in the summary,
introduction and methods.

Page 14: “The forest factory approach”. This section makes many good points, but it needs
consolidating into paragraphs (currently it has too many one sentence paragraphs) and perhaps
shortening.
Page 16: “Comparison with other studies”. I think this section is all about inventory analyses.
Thus might you consider moving the “a. Comparison with the German forest inventory” section
down here? There are several other inventory studies you could mention here, including the two
I mentioned above. Several have included basal area alongside biodiversity in their regression or
path analyses. I’m not aware of any that have also included height heterogeneity, so that’s a neat
addition to the literature.

several concerns about the analysis itself, the structure of the paper and the way the topic is

The introduction is quite general and doesn’t provide any clear hypotheses about the potential

Unfortunately, it is not mentioned in the questions of the introduction.
I have two concerns about the analysis. First, the authors don’t consider mean size or succession

Second, and most importantly, the fact that the Factory Model selects species according to their
ability to have positive growth under shade means that relative abundances of species within a
mixture can vary with density and size heterogeneity. I think it is important that the author try to
control for this effect.
I was not convinced by the validation section. The fact that climate data used for simulations is

the comparisons of results obtained for simulations and empirical data is more interesting and

In the main text, we lack some justifications for several important choices made by the authors
(the reader has to read appendix files very carefully to understand these choices). Why do the
authors standardise (normalise?) tree productivity according to tree crown area (page 4 line 10)?
Why do you sum these values at the stand scale? Why is the maximum diameter value set to
50cm (a low value for a temperate forest)?
I have read carefully the Appendix files. There are too many language mistakes (see corrections

important for your study) really supported by empirical studies? I was surprised by some values:
for instance, your model predicts that small beech trees (a shade tolerant species) cannot grow
when they receive less than 80% of available light at the top of their crown. Such a value appears
very high.
Figure 2 is difficult to read (even with subsamples). I suggest the authors provide the distribution
of plots for each number of species in separate graphs (in a supplementary material).

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors explore the relationship between tree biodiversity and productivity of forests using a
simulation modelling approach. They create a large number of forest stands in silico, each of
which has a realistic stem-size distribution and is comprised of randomly generated mixtures of
species. They then use a well-known spatially-explicit size-structured forest model within which
trees compete with one another for light depending on the relative size, position and foliar
density of their crowns. This model is used to calculate the annual aboveground woody growth
of each constituent stem, and thence the above-ground wood production (AWP) of the whole
stand. The authors repeat this exercise for almost 400,000 stands, and then explore the
covariance between species richness and AWP estimates in these simulations. They find that
10
forest structure (i.e. basal area and height heterogeneity) have a very strong influence on AWP,
and that the productivity-biodiversity effect is small and contingent upon forest structure.
This is an exciting piece of research, underpinned by very substantial computational work, that
elegantly complements (and to some extent challenges) observational studies based on repeated
measurements made in inventory plots. The journal has provided me with responses to
previous reviews. I see that the authors have added new sections exploring “underlying
mechanism” and “validation” of the simulations. I found the new mechanistic section of
particular interest.
I found the science compelling, but I would encourage the authors to focus on restructuring the
text, in order that the paper gets the positive attention that it deserves. My comments below are
aimed at improving the flow and wording of the manuscript. I have just two scientific points to
raise:
(a) Assumption iii included in the new section on page 9 got me thinking! The authors simulate
stands in which the species identity of stems is initially random, but it light demanding trees (e.g.
birch) have been placed beneath a dense canopy then the simulator will calculate that they have
negative growth rates. Instead of using these negative growth rates when calculating AWP, the
authors have instead replaced the offending stems by species that are more shade tolerant.
Whilst this make sense in terms of re-creating realistic forests, this step is in effect replicating
successional processes inside the simulator: it’s increasing the likelihood of complementarity
effects in old-growth forests (i.e. those with high BA and low height heterogeneity). I haven’t
thought through the consequence of this, but I suggest that it’s considered more explicitly in the
discussion
(b) Please would the authors provide a slightly longer explanation of the inner workings of
FORMIND in the text (for those unwilling wade through lengthy SI sections) and particularly its
main assumptions. I think it assumes that all plant “traits” including light-response curves for
photosynthesis and respiration, allocation and allometry are invariant of the competitive
environment a tree is found in. I’m not unhappy about these assumptions – a line must be drawn
somewhere! – but feel that readers would benefit from having all this information in one place.
“Minor” comments.

“basal area”? In my view, basal area isn’t a good measure of tree density!

Page 11 The authors should be praised for their efforts to compare modelling predictions with
field measurements, but I don’t think that comparisons with inventory datasets should be
described as “validation”. My suggestion would be that the eddy flux measurements are left
where they are – simply mentioned in the methods as “validation” of the ecophysiological
modelling approach. In my mind they’re contributing very little to the biodiversity issues that
are central to the paper. I would suggest that comparisons with inventory datasets are given
more prominence throughout the paper, as it’s now a selling point. Ps. it’s a great pity that the
figures pertaining to the inventory results are tucked away in appendices. I’d love to see them in
the main body of the text.

here.

Page 13 Line 26. Again, do you need to use basal area as a proxy for stem density? Why not just
stick with basal area as a measure of “forest structure”? In self thinning stands, the two
variables are strongly negatively correlated!
Page 13: Underlying mechanisms. There are several really neat ideas in this new section. To my
mind, it’s this section that really lifts the paper to a high standard. But it’s not very tightly
written at present, and it feels “tacked on” to the original manuscript rather than being
integrated into it. I’d encourage the authors to include reference to this section in the summary,
introduction and methods.
Page 14: “The forest factory approach”. This section makes many good points, but it needs
consolidating into paragraphs (currently it has too many one sentence paragraphs) and perhaps
shortening.
Page 16: “Comparison with other studies”. I think this section is all about inventory analyses.
Thus might you consider moving the “a. Comparison with the German forest inventory” section
down here? There are several other inventory studies you could mention here, including the two
I mentioned above. Several have included basal area alongside biodiversity in their regression or
path analyses. I’m not aware of any that have also included height heterogeneity, so that’s a neat
addition to the literature.

used stem size distributions are based on a Weibull-distribution (e.g.: Ryniker et al. 2006, Taubert et
013). We define that every species identities can be assigned to every tree size of the stem size
ribution. As the maximal stem diameter is 50 cm due to the species-parameterization the maximal
m size in every stem size distribution is set to 50 cm. The peaks of the stem size distribution are set at
em diameter of 5,15,25,35 and 45 cm whereby the 95% quintile are set at a stem diameter of
,26,36 and 46 cm (fig. A3).

or every combination of species mixtures and stem size distributions we generate 100 patches of
m² (= 4 hectare in total). For every hectare (25 patches) we execute step one and step two.
tep one: we determine how many trees can be found per hectare by adding tree per tree
oducing the stem size distribution as good as possible (rule 2). Thereby the only limitation is the
ce occupied by their crowns (rule 1) and species identities of trees are chosen randomly from the
ent species pool. This results in a maximal stem number per hectare.
tep two: We start the placement of trees in the 25 patches of the stem size distribution resulting
step 1 with the largest tree (defined by the largest stem diameter) followed by the next smaller
. Every tree is assigned to one of the patches randomly. Before every tree placement we check
a) …if there is enough space in the patch for the tree crown. If not another patch is selected
randomly. If no patch could take up the tree the total number of trees for the current hectare is
reduced and the filling process of step two restarts.
b) …if the assigned species identity of the tree has a positive productivity under the current light
and environmental conditions (see fig 1 in the paper). If this is not the case another species
identity (if available) is tested for positive productivity. If no species identity (of the current
mixture) has a positive productivity, another patch is selected and the placement starts with the
original species identity. If no patch could host the current tree the total number of trees in the
hectare is reduced and the filling process of step two restarts.
c) … if the change in light conditions results in a negative productivity of any other tree in the
patch. If this is the case, we check if a species identity with same stem diameter and positive
productivity is available, which shades other trees less than the original one so that all trees have
a positive productivity. If not all criteria are fulfilled another patch is selected. If no patch could
host the tree the total number of trees for the current hectare is reduced and the filling process
of step two restarts.
Note, if the tree number of the stem size distribution must be reduced, the reduction is executed in a
that keeps the shape of distribution at the hectare scale as good as possible.

B.1 Impact of temperature and functional diversity on the results.
To explore the sensitivity of the results in figure 4 to changes in the temperature of the used climate
time series, we reconduct the full analysis using a modified climate times series (we alter the
temperature time series by 1.5°C, resulting in a mean annual temperature of 6.8°C and 9.8°C). In general,
the observed pattern persists (figure B1, first & second rows). There is a slightly positive effect for forest
stands with low height heterogeneity but a negative effect for forests with high height heterogeneity.
Additionally, the variability of the productivity between the forest stands increases with increasing
temperatures.
To analyse the effect of functional diversity on productivity (instead of richness), we calculate Rao´s
Q (Rao 1982, Laliberte & Legendre 2010) using all of the physiological parameters that are related to the
productivity calculation (n=12). However, the effect of richness on productivity is negligible (figure B1). Comment [CT1]: Functional diversity?
The variability in productivity did not decrease with increasing Rao´s Q as it did for species number.

B.2 Analysis of the German forest inventory and comparison to results of
forest factory
We analyse the influence of structure on productivity within the 2418 selected plots of the German
forest inventory in the same manner as the forest factory and calculate AWP and AWP (see method
section). Because forest stands with large tree height heterogeneities were rare (2 % show height
heterogeneity larger 4 m), we calculated results for four new height heterogeneity classes (0-1, 1-2, 2-3,
3-4 m) and add one basal area class (35-45 m²). We analyse the forest stands of the forest factory using
the same structure classes and the climate measurements from Hainich for the year 2000. The
productivity in the field data increases with basal area, whereas it decreases with increasing tree height
heterogeneity in a manner similar to that observed in the analysis of the forest factory dataset (figure Comment [CT2]: This is an oversimplification!
Actually, only the highest heterogeneity level
B2, compare with figure 4). Additionally, the increment of productivity of 250 % between forest stands of appears to have an important effect with German
forest inventory while the sensitivity is higher with
low and high basal areas is similar to the productivity increment of forest stands generated by the forest the model.
factory. Finally, the almost constant productivity of forest stands in the highest tree height heterogeneity
class is also found in the forest stands of the forest factory.
Figure B2: Analysis of mean forest stand productivity (above-ground wood production) of the German forest inventory (a)
and forest stands of the forest factory (b) for 16 structure classes. Basal area classes were 5-15; 15-25; 25-35 and 35-45 m²
-1
hectare . Tree height heterogeneity (T) classes were 0-1; 1-2; 2-3 and 3-4 m.
We also analyse the relationship between diversity and productivity by using two different methods.
First, we calculate the AWP for the plots of the German forest inventory, which consists only of beech,
spruce or pine trees or their mixtures. This selection was made because other mixtures do not cover a
sufficient number of forest structure classes for the analysis. Second, we calculate the mean productivity
of all plots containing the same number of species (as conducted, for example, by Vila et al 2007). With
the second analysis, we find an increase in productivity of 10 % between one and two species mixtures,
which corresponds to the findings of other studies (e.g., Vila et al 2007). The calculated AWP instead
shows no effect of diversity, which corresponds to the analysis of the forest factory (fig B1, and figure 4).
Figure B3: Mean productivity of forest stands (above-ground wood production) depending on species number for stands of the
German forest inventory, which includes only beech, spruce and pine and their mixtures. Grey bars represent the mean
productivity over all plots with the corresponding species number. Blue bars represent mean productivity (  of the
Manuscript), where we build the mean over all  , while keeping the species number constant. Lines represent the
interquartile range.
B.3 Forest stands with only one or two species
The relationship between forest structure and productivity (fig B1) can be analyzed for stands with
only one species. Thereby the general pattern (productivity increases with increasing basal area and
decreasing height heterogeneity) can be found in all monocultures and mixtures (fig B4, B5, B6). Comment [CT3]: B4 deals with monocultures!
Comment [CT4]: There is no B6
However, monocultures vary in their absolute productivity values (fig B4), but AWPN for all monocultures
shows the general pattern quite well. In case of two species mixture with beech (fig B5) the differences
of the productivity-structure-relationships between the mixtures are much lower and vanish almost
completely for species mixtures with more than two species

(h); every dot represent one forest stand. Darker grays indicate higher height heterogeneity classes. (i) AWPN over all seven
two-species mixtures with IQR as gray stripes.
B.4 additive Partitioning analysis
Based on the coneptconcept of Loreau & Hector (2001) we perform and additional
parititioningpartitioning analysis. As the forest factory does not include information about age we use as
monocultures the average of those monocultures which show a similar forest structure. The structure
indices (BA, O) are z-transformed so that both have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. We select
the 10 nearest monocultures using Euclidian distance ( 95% of the structural distances between
monoculutresmonocultures and the mixtures are below 0.22 in the z-transformed structure and the
average distance is 0.08).
The overall analysis of the forest stands shows that both complementarity/ selection mechanisms
hasmechanisms have low potential to explain the variance of the forest productivity (fig B6). This finding
does not change if we use relative abundances (in terms of biomass or basal area) for the calculation of
the expected yield.
Figure B8: additional partitioning. a) complementarity; b) selection; c) net biodiversity effect. Line is a linear model with a as
slope. Stars indicate significance of the model: *** indicates a p-value <0.001. Every dot represents one forest stand.
The analysis of the nine different forest structure classes shows also hardly any correlation between
selection/complementarity and forest productivity.
B.5 example of the application of structure-optimality-mechanism
We analyse the relationship between diversity and the three indices of the structure-optimality-
mechanism (fig B1) by calculating the coefficient of determination for all structure classes. Comment [CT5]: B11?
The correlation between species number and optimality or forest structure indices are on average
much higher than the correlation found in the additive partitioning analysis (fig B12) and reach an R² of
up to 0.25. Please note, that a high correlation between species number and one index does not
automatically result in a strong correlation of that indixindex with the productivity . For instance, in the
forest structure class with high basal areas and low tree height heterogeneity species number correlates
quite well with structure indices (fig 13 a & b) but only week correlation with optimality (fig 13 c)). Comment [CT6]: Check the sentence
However, optimality is the main driver of productivity in this structure class (fig 13 f).

mechanism for the nine structure classes.

and BA) and optimality (<U+2126>) with forest productivity (AWP) (d, e, f). Every dot represents one forest stand. Black line shows a
fitted linear model.
B.6 Diversity-productivity relationships covering only one forest structure
class.
Beside the comparison between the forest stands of the forest factory with analysis of large data set,
which based on forest inventories and cover several forest structure classes, subsamples of the forest
factory can be compared with small datasets which belong only to one forest structure class.
Positive diversity-productivity relationship:
Many studies have analysed forest productivity in two or three species mixture experiments (e.g. Edgar
et al. 2001, Chen et al 2003, Amoroso et al 2007, Pretzsch et al 2010). For instance, Edgar et al. 2001
analysed pure aspen stands and stands with admixtures of other species. The analysed forest stands are
described by a top canopy height of ~ 25 m, a high basal area and a medium T. For the analysed forest
stands an increase of basal area with diversity was found (basal area increase of 30%). Beside a positive
structure mechanism (see manuscript fig 4), the optimality-mechanism might also support the positive
effect: In the monocultures larger aspen trees shade some smaller ones. In the mixture, smaller trees
belong mostly to more shade-tolerant species and aspen only occur in the top layer which should result in
an increase in optimality. Thus, the positive effect of diversity on productivity results from positive
correlation between diversity and structure as well as optimality. This change in both forest properties
(structure and optimality) is then responsible for the increase in productivity (figure B10). In other studies
sometimes a separation over height of the species is described (e.g Pretsch et al. 2010) or a change in
forest structure can be related to the observed productivity (e.g Amoroso et al 2007, Chen et al 2003).
Negative diversity-productivity relationship:
A decreasing relationship between diversity and productivity was found by Jacob et al. 2010 in the
Hainich forest (Germany). They analysed nine forest plots which all show high basal areas, high tree
height heterogeneity and cover an area of 50x50 meter. The plots contain only deciduous tree species
(more than six) whereby the monocultures are dominated by beech (abundance = 96%). For the
corresponding forest stands of the forest factory (same structure class only deciduous trees) (n =16) a
negative relationship between Shannon-diversity and productivity can be observed which fits to the field
observations. Our analysis of the structure-optimality-mechanisms reveals a strong effect of optimality (R²
= 0.91) and no effect of structure (R²=0.01). Thus, the negative relationship can be explained by the fact
that beech is the most productive species for all sizes of trees in such a forest (figure 6, area A). The low
diverse forests in the study are dominated by beech resulting in the maximal productivity (high O). If beech
trees are replaced by trees of other species (due to an increase in diversity) the productivity have to
decrease. In this example diversity has a negative effect on optimality, while structural effects can be
neglected (see manuscribtmanuscript figure 7). The result is a negative diversity-productivity-relationship.
This negative effect also occurs if we include also evergreen species (spruce and pine).
Figure B11: Concept of the structure-optimality-mechanism, which convert a change in diversity into a change of
productivity. A change in tree diversity between two forests result in a change of forest structure  and/or optimality <U+2126>. The
change in forest structure splits into a change of the vertical structure T (e.g. trees of different heights) and/or in a change of
horizontal structure (e.g basal area). Optimality describes how large is the productivity compared to the maximal possible
productivity of the current forest structure. Comment [CT7]: Not as the right place

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript deals with the effect of forest structure on the relationship between tree species
diversity and stand productivity. It relies on the use of a gap model (FORMIND3.0) and a specific
procedure for stand initialization called “Forest Factory”. The main message is that density and height
heterogeneity have a large influence on productivity (in their case study, greater than the effect of
species richness and functional diversity) and that the relationship between diversity and productivity
depends on stand structure. This topic is highly interesting and highly relevant. Although based on a
static perspective, the fact that population or community size structure modifies significantly the effect
of diversity on productivity is of major interest for plant ecologists. This is also a complex issue and the
authors tackled it quite well. Moreover, the authors brought important modifications to comply with
reviewers’ comments. I have however several concerns about the analysis itself, the structure of the
paper and the way the topic is presented.
R1.1: Thank you for your motivating and helpful comments and the inspiring literature. Please note,
major changes in the manuscript are marked in blue and page and line information refer to the pages of
the manuscript.
First, the structure of the paper is quite unusual and could be a bit clarified. The analysis of underlying
mechanisms (see pages 8-9) should be introduced in the method as the interest of this analysis does not
really depend on the results obtained for the effect of species diversity on productivity. Of course, such a
modification would imply to better integrate mechanisms in the introduction and the results sections.
R1.2:Thanks for this comment. We added a section to the Methods (3.e.). The results of this analysis are
now presented in the results section (Section 4.b). In addition, we added some sentences in the
introduction regarding the mechanisms (Page 2 line 7: This approach…) and revised the corresponding
sections in the discussion (section 5.b & 5.c).
The introduction is quite general and doesn’t provide any clear hypotheses about the potential effects of
structural attributes on productivity. For instance, the important positive effect of basal area on
productivity is well-known. That is why many authors consider density (Zeide 2005) as different from
forest structure (see for instance Pommerening 2002). In the same vein, several recent articles found
negative effects of size heterogeneity in monospecific stands (e.g. Bourdier et al. 2016) and one recent
study (Danescu et al. 2016) revealed positive effects of size heterogeneity (and species diversity) in
mixed stands (in Germany). These studies already indicate that the effect of size heterogeneity on
productivity can be significant in both monocultures and mixed stands. I think the authors could thus
better inform the reader about these effects and try to be more specific when presenting their
hypotheses. This would also help the authors to clarify their discussion. For instance, the authors don’t
discuss thoroughly the mechanisms that could explain the negative effect of size heterogeneity on
productivity. Finally, the idea of comparing mechanisms (see Bauhus and Forrester 2016 for a review of
processes) is interesting. Unfortunately, it is not mentioned in the questions of the introduction.
R1.3: Thank you for mentioning these interesting papers. We added a new paragraph to the introduction
to present previous studies regarding forest structure to motivate our hypothesis (page 1 line 24-30) and
revised the three questions in the introduction (page 2 line 9-14). Furthermore, we revised the text in
the discussion and in more detail discuss the effect of the mechanisms, especially the effect of size
heterogeneity on productivity. (p 10 line 5:6 & section 5.b )
I have two concerns about the analysis. First, the authors don’t consider mean size or succession stage to
control for the diversity and the size heterogeneity effects. The authors justified this choice by the fact
that basal area and mean height are correlated in their data. I think this is a problem and not a
justification. It means that the effect of basal area and mean size are confounded and that the author
cannot separate them with their constructed data set. This is a pity as, according to figure 1, tree height
has a major effect on tree growth efficiency (see next paragraph). I think it should be at least discussed
(see Lasky et al. 2013, Zhang et al. 2012).
R1.4: Thanks for mentioning this important issue. We made an additional analysis replacing basal area by
mean tree height of the forest stands and estimated the influence of forest structure and species
diversity on forest productivity (Appendix Figure B13). The analysis reveals a similar pattern compared to
the analysis in the manuscript (Figure 5), which results from the correlation between basal area and
mean tree height (R²=0.52). We also tried an analysis using only subsamples of different mean height
classes (Figure R1 shows the analysis using only the forest stands which are smaller or larger than a mean
height of 25m). In this analysis the pattern changes slightly regarding the diversity-productivity-
relationship. Hence, it would be worthwhile to analyze forest structure based on three variables
(including a forest height index) in future research. We mentioned this aspect in Discussion: Page 12
Lines 16:22
Second, and most importantly, the fact that the Factory Model selects species according to their ability
to have positive growth under shade means that relative abundances of species within a mixture can
vary with density and size heterogeneity. I think it is important that the author try to control for this
effect.
R1.5: Thanks for raising this interesting point. We made an additional analysis to quantify how strong the
mentioned effect might influence our results. We did an additional analysis, but include only those forest
stands with an more or less equal species abundance (FEve higher than 0.9, Laliberte & Legendre 2011).
The pattern stays quite the same for the diversity analysis and structure classes, except for forest stands
with high basal area and high tree height heterogeneity (figure B10; Appendix B.6). We add several lines
in the discussion, regarding this point: Page 10 Lines 25:33
I was not convinced by the validation section. The fact that climate data used for simulations is different
from climate experienced by inventory plots appears problematic. However, I think that the comparisons
of results obtained for simulations and empirical data is more interesting and more relevant. It shows
that results are coherent using different approaches (empirical data, simulations). I suggest the authors
focus more on this comparison.
R1.6: We follow your suggestions and move the former validation section into the appendix. Instead we
add two new sections (3.c and 4.c), which present results of the analysis based on the German forest
inventory (which was in the appendix before).
In the main text, we lack some justifications for several important choices made by the authors (the
reader has to read appendix files very carefully to understand these choices). Why do the authors
standardise (normalise?) tree productivity according to tree crown area (page 4 line 10)? Why do you
sum these values at the stand scale?
R1.7: Thanks for mentioning this point. We do not standardize tree productivity before we calculated
forest productivity. We sum up the total AWP of each tree to get the AWP for the whole forest stand.
We applied crown-size-standardization only for Figure 2 and for Figure A3 in the Appendix A to compare
the productivity of species per area. To make this point more clear, we renamed the standardized tree
productivity into productivity efficiency (AWPtree per unit crown area) in the captions of the figures. See
also page 4, lines 27:29.
Why is the maximum diameter value set to 50cm (a low value for a temperate forest)?
R1.8: Thanks for raising this point. We agree that a dbh of 50 cm is low compared to the maximal stem
diameters temperate trees could reach. We limit the dbh to reduce the technical complexity. However, it
is technically possible to increase the maximal dbh within the forest factory and we plan to revise this
aspect of the current forest factory. In case of the German forest inventory, 66% of the plots consist of
trees which all are smaller than a dbh of 50 cm. Thus, we include a sufficient part of the German forest
inventory for the first version of the forest factory approach. We discuss these aspects in the Appendix
A.2. “We selected[…]are possible”
I have read carefully the Appendix files. There are too many language mistakes (see corrections in the
attached files). It is important that the authors explain on which basis they define their 15 stand
structures (empirical data?) as some diameter distributions appear highly unrealistic (e.g. stand 15).
R1.9: Thanks a lot for your efforts regarding the Appendix. The aim of this study was to represent various
theoretically possible forest structures systematically (by changing max and the 95 %-quantile) with
equal frequencies. We heuristically choose these 15 (due to computation time), whereby a finer
resolution between the different types would be possible. Case 15 of the stem size distribution
represented an old even-aged forest within the model (where all trees get full light). We agree that such
a forest has a much broader stem size distribution in the field, whereby the tree height variability would
be also relative low (as in the simulation) due to tree-specific alometies.
We add some sentences regarding this issue in the Appendix A.2. “We select […] calculation time”.
I didn’t get what rule 1 consists of (how does it work?).
R1.10: The initial stem size distribution contains no information regarding the total tree number. We
therefore pack the forests in the first iteration as densely as possible by only considering tree crowns.
Later, the number of trees will be reduced due to rule 3. We add several sentences in the Appendix A.2
to clarify this point. A.2. “The input stem […] distribution (see figure 1)”.
Figure A4 (Appendix A): these graphs are of major importance for your results. They indicate that height
of the trees impact tree growth efficiency (growth per unit of crown area). If I understand correctly,
small and large trees are less efficient for all species (for Hainich environmental conditions). Is this
pattern (which is important for your study) really supported by empirical studies? I was surprised by
some values: for instance, your model predicts that small beech trees (a shade tolerant species) cannot
grow when they receive less than 80% of available light at the top of their crown. Such a value appears
very high.
R1.11: Thanks for mentioning this point. We revised figure A4 to clarify it. Now the graphic starts with
the height related to a dbh of 5 cm to show only those height-light-productivity-relationships, which are
relevant for the manuscript and which lay within the range of the data used for fitting. For the
parameterization of this relationship we use yield tables to estimate the productivity efficiency of the
different species under full light. These yield tables show this bell-shaped relationship for all
parameterized species (Schober 1996, Bohn et al. 2014). Additionally, we used typical light response
curves for the different species (Sonntag 1996 ; we add some sentences regarding this point in the
Methods). We assume the light response curve does not change between trees of different heights. The
combination of these two approaches results in the relationships of figure A4.
Figure 2 is difficult to read (even with subsamples). I suggest the authors provide the distribution of plots
for each number of species in separate graphs (in a supplementary material).
R1.12: Done, see Appendix A.3 figure A5
The number of inventory plots varies in your text: 2418 page 6 and 2415 page 7.
R1.13: Both numbers are wrong and we apologize (they originate from an older version of the
manuscript). It should be: 5,060 forest plots of the German forest inventory are used for the analysis in
the manuscript. In case of the comparison between simulated and field AWP now 13,136 forest plots are
used (Figure A6)

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors explore the relationship between tree biodiversity and productivity of forests using a
simulation modelling approach. They create a large number of forest stands in silico, each of which has a
realistic stem-size distribution and is comprised of randomly generated mixtures of species. They then
use a well-known spatially-explicit size-structured forest model within which trees compete with one
another for light depending on the relative size, position and foliar density of their crowns. This model is
used to calculate the annual aboveground woody growth of each constituent stem, and thence the
above-ground wood production (AWP) of the whole stand. The authors repeat this exercise for almost
400,000 stands, and then explore the covariance between species richness and AWP estimates in these
simulations. They find that forest structure (i.e. basal area and height heterogeneity) have a very strong
influence on AWP, and that the productivity-biodiversity effect is small and contingent upon forest
structure.
This is an exciting piece of research, underpinned by very substantial computational work, that elegantly
complements (and to some extent challenges) observational studies based on repeated measurements
made in inventory plots. The journal has provided me with responses to previous reviews. I see that the
authors have added new sections exploring “underlying mechanism” and “validation” of the simulations.
I found the new mechanistic section of particular interest.
R2.1: Thank you for your helping comments. We revised the manuscript based on your points and
revised the explanation of the model description within the manuscript. Please note, major changes in
the manuscript are marked in blue and page and line information refer to the pages of the manuscript.
I found the science compelling, but I would encourage the authors to focus on restructuring the text, in
order that the paper gets the positive attention that it deserves. My comments below are aimed at
improving the flow and wording of the manuscript. I have just two scientific points to raise:
(a) Assumption iii included in the new section on page 9 got me thinking! The authors simulate stands in
which the species identity of stems is initially random, but it light demanding trees (e.g. birch) have been
placed beneath a dense canopy then the simulator will calculate that they have negative growth rates.
Instead of using these negative growth rates when calculating AWP, the authors have instead replaced
the offending stems by species that are more shade tolerant. Whilst this make sense in terms of re-
creating realistic forests, this step is in effect replicating successional processes inside the simulator: it’s
increasing the likelihood of complementarity effects in old-growth forests (i.e. those with high BA and
low height heterogeneity). I haven’t thought through the consequence of this, but I suggest that it’s
considered more explicitly in the discussion
R2.2: This is a good point. Please see also reply R1.5 to the first reviewer. We added some further
description regarding this issue in the Discussion. Page 10 Lines 25:33
(b) Please would the authors provide a slightly longer explanation of the inner workings of FORMIND in
the text (for those unwilling wade through lengthy SI sections) and particularly its main assumptions. I
think it assumes that all plant “traits” including light-response curves for photosynthesis and respiration,
allocation and allometry are invariant of the competitive environment a tree is found in. I’m not unhappy
about these assumptions – a line must be drawn somewhere! – but feel that readers would benefit from
having all this information in one place.
R2.3: Thanks for this comment. We explained in the revised version the algorithms in more detail.
Section 3.b.
“Minor” comments.
The summary contains numerous grammatical errors. Please check this particularly carefully, as many
readers never get beyond the summary!
We revised the summary.
Page 7 Line 26. Might I suggest replacing “horizontal tree density measures (basal area)” with “basal
area”? In my view, basal area isn’t a good measure of tree density!
Done. Page 1 Line 31
Page 7 Line 21 “We compiled a large set of forest stands by using a new forest modelling approach,
which we refer to as the forest factory approach”. I think “simulated a large set of forest stands by
randomising species identities” would be a better word than “compiled” here.
Done. Page 2 Line 2
Page 7 Line 32. “For every forest stand, we measure productivity as above ground wood production per
hectare for one year (AWP) using a process-based forest gap model”. Consider writing “we estimate the
wood production of every tree in the stand using physiological relationships encoded in a process-based
forest gap model (FORMIND) and then estimate instantaneous aboveground wood production by
summing the wood production of all trees in the simulated stands”. I’ve included “instantaneous” here
because your model isn’t accounting for mortality, so will give a high AWP than measured in permanent
plots ( see papers by Coomes et al http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12622/abstract and
Jucker et al. 2016 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.2175/pdf for similar approach being
used in permanent plots, with some discussion on the subject)
Thanks, we changed the formulation according to your suggestion. Page 2 Lines 4:7
Page 7 Line 36. Please define “canopy structure” at this point or even before.
There is no “canopy structure” in this line. We assume that you refer to the term forest structure which
is now described in more detail before. Page 2 Line 2
Page 8: Consider including a nice explanatory figure here.
Done. The new Figure 1.
Page 8 Line 11: “These species vary by allometry parameterisation, productivity and responses to
climatic patterns”…. Suggest… “These species vary markedly in SHADE TOLERANCE (key to you finding
any effect of biodiversity using your modelling approach), allometry, productivity and responses to
climate”
Done. Page 3 Lines 22:24 and Page 4 Lines 2:3
Page 8 Line 20: Again I suggest “estimate” instead of “measure” as you’re not going out and measuring
things, you’re estimating them from a complex model.
Done. Page 4 Line 10
Page 8 Line 23: “The model considers establishment, mortality, competition and growth processes.” I
suggest “The model simulates the establishment, mortality, growth processes of trees that are
competing for light”
Done. Page 4 Line 1
Page 8 Line 34 “as a proxy year for a typical climate regime of the temperate zone” suggest “which has a
temperate climate” [ i.e. no need to assert this study necessarily applies elsewhere ]
We reformulate the sentence. Page 4 Line 16 We used a climate…
Page 9 Line 12: is it really “per area” for AGBtree ?
We revised this paragraph. We sum up the total AWP of each tree to get the AWP for the whole forest
stand. See also reply R1.7 and Page 4 Lines 27:29.
Page 10 “Only the structure class with a high BA and high T contains forest stands with a maximum of
seven species” … please follow this line through by stating why.
We reformulate the paragraph. Page 6 Lines 4:8.
Page 11 The authors should be praised for their efforts to compare modelling predictions with field
measurements, but I don’t think that comparisons with inventory datasets should be described as
“validation”. My suggestion would be that the eddy flux measurements are left where they are – simply
mentioned in the methods as “validation” of the ecophysiological modelling approach. In my mind
they’re contributing very little to the biodiversity issues that are central to the paper.
The corresponding paragraph has been now shifted to the Appendix A.4 and we removed the term
validation.
I would suggest that comparisons with inventory datasets are given more prominence throughout the
paper, as it’s now a selling point. Ps. it’s a great pity that the figures pertaining to the inventory results
are tucked away in appendices. I’d love to see them in the main body of the text.
We placed the comparison with inventory now into the Result section. Section 4.c
Page 11 Up to you, but I suggest “Comparisons with field datasets” rather than “validation” here.
Done. It is section 5.b now
Page 12 Line 10 “Second”…. Please make clearer what “First” is in the previous paragraph
We replaced this with “further”. Page 7 Line 29
Page 12 Line 20 … There’s a tremendous amount of fascinating stuff summarised in this one paragraph! I
suggest you describe your findings in a little more detail
We added more detail to the paragraph. Page 6 Lines 17:26.
Page 12 Line 32… isn’t it 379,000 stands? That’s quite a lot more than 300,000.
We generated ~ 379,000 stands, but in the analysis based on the forest stands, which are inside the 9
structure classes (in total ~300,000 forest stands). We added a sentence to make this more clear. Page 8
Lines 8:9
Page 13 Line 26. Again, do you need to use basal area as a proxy for stem density? Why not just stick
with basal area as a measure of “forest structure”? In self thinning stands, the two variables are strongly
negatively correlated!
We followed your suggestion and avoided the term stem density in the whole manuscript.
Page 13: Underlying mechanisms. There are several really neat ideas in this new section. To my mind, it’s
this section that really lifts the paper to a high standard. But it’s not very tightly written at present, and it
feels “tacked on” to the original manuscript rather than being integrated into it. I’d encourage the
authors to include reference to this section in the summary, introduction and methods.
We split this section as proposed by the first reviewer and integrated this analysis into parts of the
Methods and Results. In addition, we added a few sentences to the Introduction (see also reply R1.3 to
reviewer 1).
Page 14: “The forest factory approach”. This section makes many good points, but it needs consolidating
into paragraphs (currently it has too many one sentence paragraphs) and perhaps shortening.
We revised this section. Section 5.b
Page 16: “Comparison with other studies”. I think this section is all about inventory analyses. Thus might
you consider moving the “a. Comparison with the German forest inventory” section down here? There
are several other inventory studies you could mention here, including the two I mentioned above.
Several have included basal area alongside biodiversity in their regression or path analyses. I’m not
aware of any that have also included height heterogeneity, so that’s a neat addition to the literature.
Thanks for this suggestion. We move the section into the section 5.b.
