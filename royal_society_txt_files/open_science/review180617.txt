This manuscript “Soluble hexamethyl-substituted subphthalocyanine as a dopant-free hole
transport material for planar perovskite solar cells” describes the designing of a new dopant-free
hole transport material, a SubPc molecule with a hexamethyl substitution at its peripheral
position (Me6-SubPc), for planar perovskite solar cells. Compared with SubPc, the Me6-SubPc
has better organic solubility, which makes it easy for fabrication. However, the champion device
showed an extremely low PCE of 6.96%. Compared to the reported SubPc HTM-based device
with a PCE of 6.6%, this Me6-SubPc HTL in this article makes only a little improvement in PCE.
In addition, the design of Me6-SubPc lacks novelty. So, I do not recommend to publish this article
in this journal.
Some comments:
1. In addition to molecular simulation, there is no other evidence to confirm the intermolecular
interaction between each Me6-SubPc.
2. The J-V characteristics of the best devices with different HTMs and with Me6-SubPc as HTM
(Fig. 5a and Fig. 5. b) is abnormal, please check.

Reviewers' comments:
Reviewer #1
Comment 1: In addition to molecular simulation, there is no other evidence to
confirm the intermolecular interaction between each Me6-SubPc.
Answer: Thanks to the reviewer’s suggestion. Boron subphthalocyanines (SubPcs)
have a delocalized 14p electron system, many papers (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002,
41, 2561-2565; Chem. Rev. 2002, 102, 835-853; Tetrahedron Lett. 2009, 50, 2041–
2044; etc.) and the book (Andrew Simon Paton, Altering the Crystal Packing of
Boronsubphthalocyanine Derivatives through Molecular Engineering, Department of
Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, University of Toronto, 2013) had
introduced the intermolecular interaction between each SubPc. In this paper, we
confirmed face to face interaction p–p stacking and offset interaction p–p stacking
by analyzing the single crystal structure and the intermolecular interaction between
each Me6-SubPc can be confirmed by the redshift and widening of the Q-band
absorption.
Comment 2: The J-V characteristics of the best devices with different HTMs and with
Me6-SubPc as HTM (Fig. 5a and Fig. 5. b) is abnormal, please check.
Answer: Thanks to the reviewer’s suggestion. We checked Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b again.
Indeed, the subphthalocyanine-based devices have a lower FF, resulting in unnormal
J-V curves, which can be attributed to the lower hole mobility of the material. The
hole mobility of Me6-SubPc was 1.4 × 10-5 cm2 V-1 s-1, The low hole mobilities of
Me6-SubPc and dopant-free Spiro-OMeTAD were consistent with the unsatisfied JSC
and FF of solar cells, so the J-V curve is not smooth and it looks a little unusual. We
are further increasing the hole mobility and conductivity of subphthalocyanines by
means of molecular modification, and we hope to publish the results in coming days.
Reviewer #2
Comment 1: It is not clear why it is necessary to move to sub phthalocyanines at the
moment when regular phthalocyanines have been more successful.
Answer: Thanks to the reviewer’s suggestion. Indeed, the reviewer proposed a good
question. Metal phthalocyanines, especially copper(II) phthalocyanines (CuPcs), have
been investigated as the HTL in PSCs. Based on a recent study, the high efficiency
achieved for PSCs with phthalocyanine complexes as the HTL is about 17.5%. (Adv.
Energy Mater. 2017, 7, 1601733.) However, this level of efficiency was obtained
using a dopant during device fabrication. Doping may enhance the conductivity of
the HTL and thus the efficiency of the solar cell, but it also decreases the stability of
the cell. Moreover, most phthalocyanine complexes have poor solubility. To achieve
a higher solubility in common organic solvents and a more suitable highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level that aligns with the valence band of the
perovskite material, a SubPc molecule with a hexamethyl substitution at its
peripheral position (Me6-SubPc) was successfully designed and synthesized in a
one-step method. Subphthalocyanine have a delocalized 14p electron system, good
chemical and thermal stability, one-step synthesis route, simple Purification,
conducive to industrialization. Also it has high modification and can obtain different
optoelectronic properties by modifying different groups in the a, ß position or on the
central B atom to meet the needs of different optoelectronic devices. In the revised
manuscript, we added the reasons for researching subphthalocyanine, the sentence
“good chemical and thermal stability, simple synthesis route, and a delocalized 14p
electron system; SubPcs can thus be applied in organic optoelectronic devices” was
changed to “a delocalized 14p electron system, good chemical and thermal stability,
one-step synthesis route, simple Purification , conducive to industrialization.
Subphthalocyanines also have high modification and can obtain different
optoelectronic properties by modifying different groups in the a, ß position or on the
central B atom to meet the needs of different optoelectronic devices”.
Comment 2: Some arguments must be added, together with a justification for the
employment of the rest of the materials; for example why tin oxide in combination
with PCBM?
Answer: Thanks to the reviewer’s suggestion. Indeed, our devices suffer from huge
hysteresis behavior. We are trying to minimize the hysteresis effect. Extremely thin
layer of PCBM was subsequently spin cast on top of SnO2. We want it to play the role
of interface modification. Efficient charge extraction achieved with the use of PCBM
as EEL makes the device much less sensitive to the device polarization, thus
producing an inherently more stable device. Tao C et al. have been highlighted an
interesting such device architectures as
FTO/TiOX/PCBM/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Au for the first time. (Energy &
Environmental Science, 2015, 8, 2365-2370).
We used low-temperature solution-processed tin oxide as an electron transporting
layer for efficient perovskite solar cells. It has not only much higher electron mobility
but also a wider band gap than TiO2. The TiO2-based flat device, though showing
efficiencies surpassing 20%, is also affected by important shortcomings. One primary
limitation is the necessity of a 500 <U+2103> sintering step to form a crystalline TiO2 layer,
precluding its application on temperature sensitive substrates, including plastic foil,
silicon solar cells, and second perovskite solar cells.
In the revised manuscript, the sentence “Compared with TiO2 requiring high
temperature treatment and unstable ZnO, we chosen SnO2 with high electron
mobility and stability as ETL, simultaneously used PCBM to modify the interface
between perovskite and ETL to improve the electron extraction efficiency” was
added.
Following are the amendments that have been incorporated
according to the reviewer’s comments.
In the revised manuscript:
1. In Page 2, the sentence “good chemical and thermal stability, simple synthesis
route, and a delocalized 14p electron system; SubPcs can thus be applied in organic
optoelectronic devices” was changed to “a delocalized 14p electron system, good
chemical and thermal stability, one-step synthesis route, simple Purification,
conducive to industrialization. Subphthalocyanines also have high modification and
can obtain different optoelectronic properties by modifying different groups in the a,
ß position or on the central B atom to meet the needs of different optoelectronic
devices”.
2. In page 9, the sentence “Compared with TiO2 requiring high temperature
treatment13, 49 and unstable ZnO50, 51, we chosen SnO2 with high electron mobility
and stability as ETL, simultaneously used PCBM to modify the interface between
perovskite and ETL to improve the electron extraction efficiency30, 31, 52” was added.
