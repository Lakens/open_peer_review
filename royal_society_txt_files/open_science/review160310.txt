This manuscript reports results of an experiment manipulating a video game player's weapon in
terms of its "power" (weak or strong) and its type (Bushmaster M4-type carbine or futuristic
plasma gun) and measured an array of attitudinal and behavioral intent measures. While the
manipulation found the "strong" version to result in more in-game "success," null effects were
found for all measures bar some sporadic relationships between individual differences and
outcomes.
My initial instinct is that there is limited convincing evidence that a significant effect on attitudes
toward a specific firearm as tested here would have much practical relevance, though perhaps
more than a glimmer of conceptual relevance, to actual gun violence, limiting the importance of
even a significant result for the relationships under study (other than if there were effects on
measures of behavioral intent, effects on which seem unlikely). That said, the state of the media
violence literature is such that much is made of the practical significance of evidence for social
priming-type responses such as the one tested here, so it seems the authors shouldn't be criticized
for using the coins of the realm in a research area dominated by social learning and social
priming studies--particularly given that they are being candid about their null findings at a time
when suspicions that the published social priming literature has been systematically inflated by
the culture of research, peer review, and publication. Further, the literature review shows
justification for the study in (mostly anecdotal, but prominent) claims in both popular and
academic literature.
Thus, while to me significant effects in a design like this seem unlikely and in many cases
perhaps practically unimportant anyway, I am actually very much in support of this manuscript's
potential value to this excellent journal's readers because findings of this type are likely to leaven
the seemingly anomalous findings that are published from similar studies and given the apparent
perceived need in the literature and among policymakers (e.g., the NSF directorate) to see the
possibility addressed that firearm product placement has the type of effects analyzed here.
That said, I would make some recommendations regarding changes that should likely be made
before the manuscript is appropriate for publication.
A substantial issue to me is the absence of reported Cronbach's alphas (or similar reliability
measure) for indices. It seems these should be provided, or their absence justified. This is an
issue perhaps easily remedied, but one that seems crucial to interpretation of the measures'
utility--even for null findings, we should be sure about what a measure was measuring. Again,
this may be easily remedied, but it is my major methodological worry about the manuscript at the
moment.
Another issue meriting attention as perhaps a limitation is that the "strength" manipulation
conflates a few things, manipulating in-game effectiveness but also throwing in some aesthetics
that may or may not have predictable outcomes (e.g., is the screen shaking a disruption? Does the
changed animation introduce unexpected perceptions?). This seems a minor issue given the null
effects, but may be worth noting as a design issue for replication as well as (possibly) at least a
minor possibility for multiple effects canceling each other out (seems unlikely conceptually here,
but methodologically possible).
3
On manuscript page 3, it is a little unclear what a "negative relationship between violent game
exposure and gun control attitudes" is. It can be inferred from the context perhaps, but the
valence here is ambiguous. A word on which type of attitudes (pro- or anti-) would clarify and
seems worth the effort given the study's pertinence to the manuscript's rationale.
If for no reason than the historical record, it might be valuable to mention which game(s) hosted
Obama's ads in 2008.
While I found the literature review adequate, it is possible that readers with less background in
this area of research might benefit from more detail about the mechanisms by which the firearm
product placement might influence the outcomes measured here--perhaps at the expense of a
slightly shorter version of the section on the actual product-placement examples. I am not
adamant about this reorganization and change in prioritization, but thought it merited mention.
While "based on their subject" number seems to imply a random, or randomish, assignment, it
would be useful to clarify whether and how random assignment was accomplished to leave no
doubt about that element of the design. It is my understanding that instances where assignment
is not randomized are sometimes buried in ambiguous wording. I am inclined to assume this is
not such a case, but clarifying as much seems like a good practice for all manuscripts where
random assignment is indeed carried out.
I may be wrong, or splitting hairs, or both, but "questionnaire" seems the appropriate precise
term for the instrument here rather than "survey."
As a final note, given the topic and the background in the NSF report and other documents, it is
appreciated that the authors haven't indulged in framing the manuscript in the backdrop of an
introduction focused on a specific mass crime or other prominent tragedy involving an Armalite-
style assault rifle and a video-game user. As Markey and others have noted, these sensational
references were once common, but are in decline, and I am glad we do not see such exploitative
references here in a manuscript that has instead opted to focus on reporting the scientific and
public conversation rather than borrowing from our worst tragedies for the sake of the
manuscript's dramatic narrative. Many thanks!

Q9. Comments to the Author(s)
Comments will be sent to author(s), enter confidential comments in Comments to Editor. You
may attach a file, do not include identifying attributes as these may be seen by author(s). – In
general, I liked the concept and the ideas tested in this research. Although the anticipated effects
were not found, the research seems to have been conducted well, and would suggest that such
placement may have smaller effects than might have been anticipated. Below, I suggest some
additional variables that could potentially influence the placement process.
1. In the first paragraph of the section of the introduction dealing with product placement,
there are a number of published studies in the literature that could be recruited to back up
statements made by the authors. For example, some research has examined how making people
aware of product placement prior to viewing can affect the effectiveness of the placement; and
other research has examined character variables (liking, etc.) to evaluate their effect.
2. In the discussion section the authors evaluate a variety of factors that could potentially
increase the chance that gun placement in video games might prove effective. I might add that in
5
addition to simply employing a game in which the setting was more realistic (e.g., Grand Theft
Auto), there may be an effect of the purpose of gun use within the game. For example, perhaps
portraying a criminal in GTA would have less influence than portraying a citizen using the gun
to stop a crime. This may be particularly true for people who already support gun rights and
therefore have perhaps internalized the NRA’s “only a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy
with a gun” rhetoric. Enacting that scenario within the game may engender a particular liking of
that gun.
3. Related to point 2, above, I wonder whether seeking the hypothesized effects within
different groups within the study might make a difference. Perhaps Libertarians and/or
conservatives might be more influenced regarding liking of the brand used in the game (since
they already may be more open to gun ownership). It may be the case that more liberal
participants have already made decisions about gun control, their own desire to own a gun, etc.,
and therefore the manipulation may not be effective on them. An analogy might be: If I am a
committed environmentalist who drives a hybrid car, I might play a driving game in a gas
guzzling SUV, but not report that I would be interested in owning one. On the other hand, if I
don’t believe in global warming, and own an old SUV, playing the game in a branded (cool) SUV
may lead me to improve my view of that vehicle.

seems a very good one. The effect is explained well, as is the fact that the stimulus is typical of
games, but it may be worth just a sentence or so underscoring the very good point the authors
make justifying the manipulation ("In this case, we had genuinely hoped to obtain a significant
effect by using the strongest manipulation possible.") in case a reader has the knee-jerk
methodological response that I did (albeit invalid). The authors and editor can decide how much
this needs addressed, though (again, I think a sentence may get there), or if the matter should
already be clear from the current wording.

methodological response that I did (albeit invalid). The authors and editor can decide how much
this needs addressed, though (again, I think a sentence may get there), or if the matter should
already be clear from the current wording.
Thanks to the authors again for their good work and their careful work during the revision
process!
Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-160310.R1)
We are grateful for this opportunity to publish with RSOS.
We confirm that the manuscript includes the required ethics statement, that all data and materials
are available in a public online repository, that no authors have competing interests, that authors'
contributions are listed, acknowledgements are given, and there was no funding.
We added the comment suggested by our reviewer: that the gun power manipulation
confounded several technical features, but in service of providing the strongest manipulation
possible. We have also mentioned that, although we have failed to find a product-placement
effect, perhaps such effects are possible in the long term (e.g. dozens of hours, rather than 15
minutes).

ase find enclosed a revised version of our manuscript, RSOS-160310, Brief use of a specific
in a violent game does not affect attitudes towards that gun.” We are grateful for this
ortunity to revise and resubmit.
r reviewer(s) made a number of valuable suggestions. We summarize them below, and
lain how we addressed each.
he manuscript ought to report Cronbach’s alpha for all scales.
apologize for this oversight. The manuscript now reports Cronbach’s alphas when
oducing the scales (p. 11-12). The alphas for primary outcomes are generally acceptable,
ging from .74 to .84.
he strength manipulation may conflate several things, such as disorienting amounts of
een-shaking or surprise at dismemberment.
his case, we had genuinely hoped to obtain a significant effect by using the strongest
nipulation possible. Since all the modifications are designed to influence the same latent
struct, we felt this was an appropriate way to make a powerful manipulation.
explain that the screen shake and muzzle flash are modest and typical of video games; strong
ugh to give an impression of powerful recoil but not so strong as to make the gun difficult to
.
n the literature review, it is not clear what is meant by “a negative relationship between
lent game exposure and gun control attitudes.”
have rephrased for clarity, and note that the study is now in press: “One correlational study
orts that college undergraduates who have been exposed to more violent video games have
re negative attitudes towards gun control legislation (2).”
More could be done to explain the potential mechanisms of the purported link between
arm product placement and outcomes.
s is a good suggestion. Unfortunately, little is known about the mechanisms other than those
posed by the General Learning Model, and even those predictions are vague (e.g. “video
es are a learning tool” and “positive associations formed in the game can persist outside the
e.”) Thus, there seems to be little preexisting theory to add.
he randomization strategy could be better explicated.
now explain that an excel spreadsheet was created with rotating condition numbers, e.g.
jects 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were assigned to conditions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 1. The number of sessions
ducted per day or per week was not a multiple of 4, and so the results are not confounded by
e-of-day or day-of-week effects.
ditional suggestions (from a second reviewer?) were:
n the first paragraph of the section of the introduction dealing with product placement,
re are a number of published studies in the literature that could be recruited to back up
tements made by the authors.
have found and added two relevant citations.
n addition to simply employing a game in which the setting was more realistic (e.g.,
and Theft Auto), there may be an effect of the purpose of gun use within the game. For
mple, perhaps portraying a criminal in GTA would have less influence than portraying
tizen using the gun to stop a crime.
now mention the possibility and potential of such a scenario.
subgroup analysis might have revealed effects among those with more amenable
tudes towards guns.
r early analysis of this study embarked on a thorough post-hoc exploration of such subgroup
cts and generally found none. In general, we feel we do not have the sample size to make
h subgroup analyses worthwhile, particularly in light of the number of tests that would be
olved.
her minor edits:
mention which games hosted Obama’s ads in 2008.
now refer to the instrument as a “questionnaire” rather than a “survey”.
found an error in our code that was causing our policy index to be incorrectly scored.
recting this error revealed an effect of gender on this outcome, but the effect of the
nipulation is still null.
