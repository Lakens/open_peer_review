The author reports on kinetic Monte Carlo calculations of the tracer diffusion and ionic
conductivity in various lattice gas models that attempt to describe the diffusion kinetics atomistic
situation in lithium garnets. The transition probability for ion jumps that was used is given in
Eqns 7-9. These equations seem to be just the well-known Metropolis et al., J. Chem. Phys. Vol.
21, 1087 (1953) transition probability. It is also well known that this particular transition
probability is grossly inadequate, see for example Singer and Peschel, Z. Phys, B Vol 39, p333
(1980), for describing diffusion kinetics in real materials (but not for calculating equilibrium
quantities). That paper should be cited by the way. There are in fact an infinite number of
transition probabilities that satisfy the statistical mechanical requirement for detailed balance.
Each one will give rather different results for the jump frequencies and the correlation factors.
The finding in this paper that the ionic conductivity is reduced by interactions is not in fact
generally true at all and is quite misleading (Fig 3f). A very common transition probability (a
bond breaking one at the initial site where the chosen ion resides) is that given by Sato and
Kikuchi (Ref 15). With this, Murch and Thorn published KMC results for honeycomb lattice gases
with site energy differences and nearest neighbour repulsion (for the beta and beta’’ aluminas),
see Phil. Mag. Vol. 35, 493 (1977), Phil. Mag. Vol. 36, 517 (1977), Phil. Mag, Vol. 36, 529 (1977).
Although the geometry was different, the results for the correlation factors are quite similar to
those shown in this paper. These works are not cited either. As the dates on the various
references just given suggest, all of this was known some 40 years ago!! In 2017, one would expect
KMC calculations in lattice gases to routinely use ab initio calculations of the migration energies
according to the locations and environments of the various sites, see for example Van der Ven’s
work, Reference 5. To use classical lattice gas models with nearest neighbour interactions today
is, in my opinion, pretty out of date, especially since rather similar results are already well
known. It might be argued that something can still be learned from such results. Indeed, the
author tries to argue this to some extent, but since his results depend on the choice of the
transition probability (a very poor one was chosen) the results given are not convincing at all.

The author has used lattice gas Monte Carlo calculations to understand the effect of the
interaction of defects on ionic motion in the garnet lattice. This is a very well written paper,
which explores a topic that has huge implications for solid state batteries, which is certainly of
interest in the UK right now with the advent of the government's announcement of the desire for
the electrification of vehicles by 2040. The authors results show the vital importance of including
correlation effects in any analysis of ionic conductivity in these systems, and that this is necessary
for the correct paramaterisation of multiscale models in the future. The paper can be accepted
once the minor comments below have been rectified.
Minor Corrections:
In the abstract the author states "We predict particularly strong correlation effects at xLi = 3 (from
site energies) and xLi = 6 (from nearest-neighbour repulsion)." This is confusing for a non expert,
as the author has not yet introduced what x is in the context of a garnet. This needs to be
changed.

I have read the manuscript and both sets of reviewer comments. In my opinion the manuscript is
suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science subject to minor changes.
The majority of recent computational studies concerning ion transport in solids focus on the
activation energy for a single hopping process, which as the author correctly states has serious
limitations. Approaches to improving the predictive power of materials simulations, including
drawing from the older (and largely forgotten) literature is important.

author can use to strengthen the manuscript. The author does not claim to have invented any
new theories, but applies a series of statistical mechanical models to modern materials.
Reviewer 2 is strongly supportive of the work.
In summary, this is a clear and high quality manuscript that merits publication.

various lattice gas models that attempt to describe the diffusion kinetics atomistic situation in
ium garnets. The transition probability for ion jumps that was used is given in Eqns 7-9. These
ations seem to be just the well-known Metropolis et al., J. Chem. Phys. Vol. 21, 1087 (1953)
sition probability.
The reviewer is correct that the jump frequencies used in this study use the scheme by
Metropolis et al. I have added a comment that makes this explicit, and have included a
citation to the original Metropolis paper.
also well known that this particular transition probability is grossly inadequate, see for example
ger and Peschel, Z. Phys, B Vol 39, p333 (1980), for describing diffusion kinetics in real
terials (but not for calculating equilibrium quantities). That paper should be cited by the way.
re are in fact an infinite number of transition probabilities that satisfy the statistical mechanical
uirement for detailed balance. Each one will give rather different results for the jump frequencies
the correlation factors.
In my opinion, it is not clear from the Singer and Peschel paper that this transition
probability is "grossly inadequate". This seems to be a rather subjective claim. It is
certainly correct however that in real materials particle hops require overcoming a
potential energy barrier, and this is not accounted for in the Metropolis scheme. It is
also true that if barrier crossing is included in the hopping activation energy, the effect
depends on the details of how these barriers are included in the description of the
potential energy surface.
There is already a comment in the manuscript that discusses this:
Because the lattice-gas model used here considers hops as barrierless, where hopping
probabilities only depend on energy differences between initial and final states, the
effective transport coefficients calculated here cannot be directly compared to
experimental values. For non- interacting systems, introducing fixed barrier heights for
tet<U+2194>oct hops is equivalent to scaling the hopping prefactor <U+03BD>', which preserves relative
differences in the transport coefficients presented here. A more realistic model would
need to account for the influence of local site occupations on individual hopping
barriers, see e.g. Refs. 91 and 92, and would give quantitative deviations from the trends
presented here for diffusion coefficients and correlation factors.
I have added a reference to the Singer and Peschel paper in this comment. I also have
added a further more detailed discussion at the end of the manuscript:
A second limitation is the use of the Metropolis scheme for calculating hopping
probabilities (Eqn. 8). This approach considers hops to be barrierless, with hopping
probabilities that depend only on the energy differences between initial and final
ply to reviewers’ comments for manuscript RSOS-170824
configurations. In real materials, ion hopping is an activated process, and ions move
across potential energy barriers. Expressions for hopping probabilities that take these
barrier heights into account are expected to give more accurate kinetics, but require
parameters that describe typical barrier heights, and how these are affected by the
instantaneous local arrangements of mobile atoms.[89,90] For specific materials, these
parameters can be derived from first-principles calculations.[91–94]
For this study, we have focussed on a broad description of the geometry effects in the
garnet lattice. Including hopping barriers in a general scheme would significantly
increase the dimensionality of the available parameter space, making a full analysis of
lattice geometry effects impractical. It is apposite, however, to consider to what extent
the results presented here, using the simplified Metropolis scheme, might differ from
equivalent calculations that include hopping barrier effects. Addressing this question in
the context of specific garnet materials will be the subject of a future study.
Interestingly, the behaviour described here; that in interacting systems, ordering is
predicted at particular stoichiometries commensurate with the lattice symmetry, which
manifests as strong correlation effects and greatly reduced transport coefficients; is
qualitatively similar to results obtained for other lattice geometries using lattice-gas
Monte Carlo models that do include barrier terms. For example, Murch and Thorn have
modelled the effects of site-energy differences and nearest-neighbour repulsion in the
2D honeycomb lattice, using a fixed transition barrier when deriving their hopping
probabilities, and observed ordering and strong correlation effects at half-occupancy.[95
—97] The observation of qualitatively similar behaviour using models that do account
for hopping barriers, albeit for different lattice geometries, suggests that these effects
are not strongly dependent on the precise scheme. It should also be noted that any
ordering of the mobile particles, which is the physical origin of these correlation effects,
is independent of any transition barriers. The equilibrium distribution of particles
depends only on the relative energies of different configurations, and is therefore exactly
described (for a given Hamiltonian) by the Metropolis scheme.
Reference 89 is the Singer and Peschel paper, and references 95—97 are the papers by
March and Thorn.
finding in this paper that the ionic conductivity is reduced by interactions is not in fact
erally true at all and is quite misleading (Fig 3f).
This finding is not presented as being generally true.
ery common transition probability (a bond breaking one at the initial site where the chosen ion
des) is that given by Sato and Kikuchi (Ref 15).
h this, Murch and Thorn published KMC results for honeycomb lattice gases with site energy
erences and nearest neighbour repulsion (for the beta and beta’’ aluminas), see Phil. Mag. Vol.
493 (1977), Phil. Mag. Vol. 36, 517 (1977), Phil. Mag, Vol. 36, 529 (1977).
hough the geometry was different, the results for the correlation factors are quite similar to those
wn in this paper.
Indeed. This is particularly interesting, given that the calculations of Murch and Thorn
used a different choice of transition probabilities, and considered a different lattice
geometry. This point is now discussed in the manuscript in the new section quoted
above.

se works are not cited either.
These papers by Murch and Thorn are now cited (see the additional discussion text
above).
the dates on the various references just given suggest, all of this was known some 40 years ago.
2017, one would expect KMC calculations in lattice gases to routinely use ab initio calculations
he migration energies according to the locations and environments of the various sites, see for
mple Van der Ven’s work, Reference 5. To use classical lattice gas models with nearest
ghbour interactions today is, in my opinion, pretty out of date, especially since rather similar
ults are already well known. It might be argued that something can still be learned from such
ults. Indeed, the author tries to argue this to some extent, but since his results depend on the
ice of the transition probability (a very poor one was chosen) the results given are not
vincing at all.
I agree that for a specific material one would expect a computational study to use
precise descriptions of migration energies (see e.g. references 91—94). This is not the
aim of this work however. Instead I have focussed on a broad study of the pure geometry
effects across a general parameter space:
Rather than seeking an explicit description of a single material, as one might by using
e.g. first-principles or classical molecular dynamics, here we focus on understanding
general behaviour as a function of lattice geometry and mobile ion stoichiometry, and
how this changes in response to conceptually simple, but physically motivated,
microscopic interactions.
For this study, we have focussed on a broad description of the geometry effects in the
garnet lattice. Including hopping barriers in a general scheme would significantly
increase the dimensionality of the available parameter space, making a full analysis of
lattice geometry effects impractical. It is apposite, however, to consider to what extent
the results presented here, using the simplified Metropolis scheme, might differ from
equivalent calculations that include hopping barrier effects. Addressing this question in
the context of specific garnet materials will be the subject of a future study.

he abstract the author states "We predict particularly strong correlation effects at xLi = 3 (from
energies) and xLi = 6 (from nearest-neighbour repulsion)." This is confusing for a non expert, as
author has not yet introduced what x is in the context of a garnet. This needs to be changed.
This sentence has been edited to clarify what these stoichiometries mean in the context
of the garnet lattice:
We predict particularly strong correlation effects at xLi = 3 (from site energies) and xLi =
6 (from nearest-neighbour repulsion), where xLi = 9 corresponds to a fully occupied
lithium sublattice.
