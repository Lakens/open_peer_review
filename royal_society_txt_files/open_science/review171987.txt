In this study, the authors developed a GC-MS based needle retention device combined with
highly variable data analysis to characterize the chemical differences of the volatile components
between crude and processed Baizhu Shaoyao San (BSS), a classic Chinese herbal formula widely
used in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. In order to profile the volatile components and
quickly identify the different chemical identifiers, Carbopack X, 121 and 123 compounds were
detected in raw and processed BSS, respectively, using a triple needle, packed with DVB and
3
Carboxen 1000 sorbents.
According to the results of statistical analysis, raw and processed BSS successfully separated two
groups with good fitting and prediction parameters. Furthermore, 21 compounds have identified
variable markers as potential markers that can be used to rapidly separate these two types of
samples using S-PLOT and projection analysis.
According to authors, this successful extraction, identification and determination of volatile
markers to distinguish processed BSS from raw materials has also shown that the strategy may
also apply to the investigation of chemical transformations underlying the herbicide treatment of
TCM in other herbal formulas.
To distinguish the differences between the volatile components comprehensively, raw and
processed BSS performed uncontrolled PCA data analysis for the classification of these two
groups.
To further analyze the different components of the volatile substances between the raw and
treated BSS, the inspected OPLS-DA was then applied to GC-MS data matrices.
To determine the potential chemical markers contributing to the difference between crude and
processed BSS, S-plot and VIP analyzes were performed after OPLS-DA.
This work is quite well designed. This work will help you figure out which needle is suitable for
similar studies. The results are statistically well evaluated. The results obtained have revealed
potential markers. It is a work that can be applied to other plants. This work will shed light on
similar studies.
as a suggestion, the authours can add a list of the effects of working on the abstract and the
conclusion.

Dear editor and reviewers
On behalf of my co-authors, we thank you very much for giving us an opportunity to
revise our manuscript (manuscript number: RSOS-171987) “Discrimination of
volatiles in herbal formula Baizhu Shaoyao San before and after processing
using needle trap device with multivariate data analysis” submitted to the
well-known ‘Royal Society Open Science’.
We have learned much from your and the reviewers’ comments, which are fair,
encouraging, and constructive. After carefully studying the comments and your advice,
we have made the corresponding changes in our revised manuscript. Our responses to
the comments are enclosed at the end of this letter for your kind consideration.
We would like to express our great appreciation to you and reviewers for comments
on our paper.
If you have any question about our paper, please don’t hesitate to contact me.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Thank you and best wishes.
Yours sincerely,
Hao Cai
For Reviewer #1:
<U+F0D8> 1. Authors have been explained how is calculated LOD concentration.
Answer: Thank you very much for your kind suggestions. As we all know, due to the
high sensitivity of MS detector, the countless peaks usually exist in an optimized
GC-MS spectrum, which could cause confusion in terms of identifying compounds
with significant difference in BSS before and after processing. As a compromise, only
those peaks with area occupying more than 0.01% of the total peak area were deemed
as the important peaks to carry out the further identification and comparison.
Consequently, the LOD calculated by the Agilent MSD ChemStation was about 19.7
times to the value of the background signal.
<U+F0D8> 2. RSD have to calculate to use with one or a few real samples such studies.
Answer: Thank you very much for your kind suggestions. Actually, we indeed used 6
duplicated samples of crude BSS to examine the repeatability of the NTD method.
Then, the main peaks of these samples with good intensities in GC-MS including
D-limonene, 7,7-dimethyl-1-vinyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, caryophyllene,
<U+03B3>-elemene, ß-bisabolene, (3E,5E)-7-isopropyl-8-methyl-3,5,7-nonatrien-2-one,
atractylon, elixene, ß-selinene, selina-3,7(11)-diene, germacrene B, <U+03B3>-vetivenene, and
dehydrofukinone, were selected to calculate the RSD of retention time and peak area.
As a result, the RSD of retention time and peak area were less than 0.1% and 10%,
which showed a good repeatability.
<U+F0D8> 3. The blank value should be shown in the text.
Answer: Thank you very much for your kind suggestions. The blank sample of the
NTD method has been previously tested, which only contains several peaks with
extremely low intensity compared with samples, and most of them are the loss of
packing materials from GC-MS capillary column. The GC-MS spectrum of the blank
sample has been submitted as an electronic supplementary material and the additional
explanation was added in the section of ‘3.1. Method development and validation’ in
our revised manuscript with red color.
<U+F0D8> 4. How many time the experiments have been repeated. The data should
have error bar in all figures.
Answer: Thank you very much for your kind suggestions. The experiments have been
repeated six times for crude and processed samples respectively. Actually, it is not
necessary that all figures in our manuscript need extra error bar, and some of them
embody intrinsically the idea of error bar. Fig. 1 is a schematic representation of the
NTD method which does not need error bar. Fig. 2 illustrates the representative
profiles of crude and processed BSS obtained through GC-MS, and these types of
figures usually does not contain error bar according to the similar published articles.
Fig. 3 is the score scatter plots of multivariate data analysis PCA and OPLS-DA. In
the plots, each point represents an individual test sample, where crude and processed
BSS samples obviously distribute in two clusters according to their variances of all
the components contained. Further observation of each crude and processed cluster
individually, each point of samples does not completely overlap but separates in
certain degree in their own cluster, which indeed reflects the error bar in an another
way. Similarly, Fig. 4 (A) also expresses the error bar in a different way. The Y-axis of
Fig. 4 (A) represents the confidence to the difference of each compound in crude and
processed BSS. In other words, those compounds with higher variations among
average contents in crude and processed BSS and lower standard deviations in each
group own the higher possibilities to be the marker compounds between crude and
processed BSS.
<U+F0D8> 5. The results must be compared with other studies such as RSD, enrichment
factor, detection limit etc.
Answer: Thank you very much for your kind suggestions. We sincerely apologize for
the insufficiency of the result part. Indeed, it is quite important and should be stated
detailly in the paper. Therefore, with your help, these relevant contents and references
were carefully added in our revised manuscript with red color in the section of ‘3.
Results and discussion’.
<U+F0D8> 6. In addition, in the below works related to your study (see below) were not
cited by authors and could be included in the table and compared with
proposed procedure :
Answer: Thank you very much for your kind suggestions. We really appreciate for
your considerate humanness and rigorous academic spirit. However, we are unable to
find the ‘the below works related to our study (see below)’ you mentioned in this
comment, probably due to some unknown problems. Thank you again for your kind
suggestions.
For Reviewer #2:
<U+F0D8> 1. As a suggestion, the authors can add a list of the effects of working on the
abstract and the conclusion.
Answer: Thank you very much for your kind suggestions. We really feel honored to
receive your affirmative comments on my manuscript. With your kind help, we have
listed some promising effects of our work in the sections of ‘Abstract’ and
‘Conclusion’ in our revised manuscript with red color.
