The authors present molecular observations (16S rRNA) and analysis for microbes in the South
West Indian Ocean. Samples were collected from a number of locations and depths and analyzed
using various statistical methods. I did not find any major problems in the methodology or paper.
However, I am not convinced their data or analysis support their main conclusion about dispersal
limitation (see below).
The paper is basically a characterization of a microbial community, low on mechanistic insight,
and should be of interest mostly to the people in the same area. This is evident from the
discussion section, where most findings acknowledge that they are “similar” with previous
reports.
The multi-variate analysis included other variables (e.g. nutrients). Why are those not shown in
the results? Is it that they are simply not important? Without considering the role of
environmental factors, the conclusion presented in the last sentence of the paper seems
unjustified to me. What evidence is there to reject the idea that the biogeography observed is due
to environmental selection?
I think the paper would be improved if the results were compared to those from these papers:

the deep Arctic Ocean. ISME J. 2010;4(4):564-76.

General Comments
Your study is clear and well written, pointing to the effects of depth in oceanic bacterioplankton
community structuring.
My main concern is that the primers you have used (515F-806R) underestimate one of the most
important members of the marine bacterioplankton (SAR11) and overestimates
Gammaproteobacteria
Specifically, I cite the paper: “Parada, A. E., Needham, D. M. and Fuhrman, J. A. (2016), Every
base matters: assessing small subunit rRNA primers for marine microbiomes with mock
communities, time series and global field samples. Environ Microbiol, 18: 1403–1414.
doi:10.1111/1462-2920.13023”
Here, they mention “We found the popular primer pair 515F (515F-C) and 806R greatly
underestimated (e.g. SAR11) or overestimated (e.g. Gammaproteobacteria) common marine
taxa.”
So, I think that you should provide convincing evidence that the primers you’ve used are giving
an unbiased view of the studied bacterioplankton communities.
Minor comments

L219: Here the potential problems with primers become evident I think. You mention
Gammaproteobacteria was dominant (overestimation?). In L226, you indicate that
Gammaproteobacteria is more abundant than Alphaproteobacteria, which also could be the
product of primer biases.
L274: HTCC2188, this is a culture code, you should have a taxonomic identification at some level.
L288-289: The lower abundance of alphaproteobacteria in your study compared to Sunagawa et
al 2015 is most likely due to primer-related underestimations. Most other open-ocean studies tend
to agree with the view presented in Sunagawa et al.

Both referees express significant reservations about the work reported in this MS. Ref. 1 is
concerned with lack of analysis in relation to the environment -- a critical issue given the authors
are claiming communities were structured more by depth than by latitude. Ref. 2 has concerns
over known biases with the primers that have been used for characterizing the bacterioplankton
communities. It is not clear to me that this second issue can be overcome.

Comments to the Author:
Both referees express significant reservations about the work reported in this MS. Ref. 1 is
concerned with lack of analysis in relation to the environment -- a critical issue given the
authors are claiming communities were structured more by depth than by latitude. Ref. 2 has
concerns over known biases with the primers that have been used for characterizing the
bacterioplankton communities. It is not clear to me that this second issue can be overcome.
All environmental data was included in the manuscript, but from the analysis from the
multivariate regression tree only depth and latitude resulted as significant drivers of microbial
communities in our environment. The data has been published previously (Djurhuus et al 2015).
We have added this as a reference in the data analysis section. Also, we have explicitly stated in
the results that the only statistically significant drivers of microbial communities were depth and
latitude. In addition, we added a couple of sentences explaining the environmental condition of
the seamounts.
The sequencing of this study was done as a part of the Earth Microbiome Project prior to the
publication of Parada et al. 2016 and re-sequencing is not an option at this point. While we
acknowledge the limitations of the primers used we do contend that any biases are consistent
across the study, leaving the comparisons within the study unaffected. All primers are known to
have biases and while it is regrettable that our results are not directly comparable to those
obtained with the new primer deemed to be superior by Parada et al., (2016), we contend that
there is no single set of any primers that can fully capture the true microbial community.
Biases, such as the ones seen by selective primers prevails in all of community ecology because
no sampling tool, be it a trawl (Heino et al., 2011), primer (Parada et al. 2016), or plankton
samplers (Haury et al., 1973), can sample every constituent of any community representative.
The question is not whether or not a primer is biased but whether a bias is consistent across a
study, and we strongly feel that our study is valid as we do the same analysis consistently
across all samples.
We know that the primers are biased, especially against SAR11 and for Gammaproteobacteria,
however, our analyses were mostly focused on an OTU level not targeting any specific taxa. We
believe our findings on the entire microbial community with a richness of >1000 OTU’s per
sample to still be valid. Since all samples were sequenced using the same primer, they would all
be biased in a similar fashion and the main conclusions of the study are not affected. We have
added a paragraph in the discussion critically assessing the primers we used and have added
that the amount of Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria (fig. 9, supplementary
material) might be over and underestimated, respectively.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors present molecular observations (16S rRNA) and analysis for microbes in the South
West Indian Ocean. Samples were collected from a number of locations and depths and
analyzed using various statistical methods. I did not find any major problems in the
methodology or paper. However, I am not convinced their data or analysis support their main
conclusion about dispersal limitation (see below).
The paper is basically a characterization of a microbial community, low on mechanistic insight,
and should be of interest mostly to the people in the same area. This is evident from the
discussion section, where most findings acknowledge that they are “similar” with previous
reports.
The multi-variate analysis included other variables (e.g. nutrients). Why are those not shown in
the results? Is it that they are simply not important? Without considering the role of
environmental factors, the conclusion presented in the last sentence of the paper seems
unjustified to me. What evidence is there to reject the idea that the biogeography observed is
due to environmental selection?
For our analysis we do include all the environmental data, however, since these were not
significant, we did not report the general results, since they have been published previously
(Djurhuus et al., 2015). We agree that last sentence of the manuscript sounds convoluted. We
are exactly trying to make the point that environmental selection is strong, even in pelagic
environments where it previously has been postulated to be weak.
I think the paper would be improved if the results were compared to those from these papers:

the deep Arctic Ocean. ISME J. 2010;4(4):564-76.

Your study is clear and well written, pointing to the effects of depth in oceanic bacterioplankton
community structuring.
My main concern is that the primers you have used (515F-806R) underestimate one of the most
important members of the marine bacterioplankton (SAR11) and overestimates
Gammaproteobacteria
Specifically, I cite the paper: “Parada, A. E., Needham, D. M. and Fuhrman, J. A. (2016), Every
base matters: assessing small subunit rRNA primers for marine microbiomes with mock
communities, time series and global field samples. Environ Microbiol, 18: 1403–1414.

Here, they mention “We found the popular primer pair 515F (515F-C) and 806R greatly
underestimated (e.g. SAR11) or overestimated (e.g. Gammaproteobacteria) common marine
taxa.”
So, I think that you should provide convincing evidence that the primers you’ve used are giving
an unbiased view of the studied bacterioplankton communities.
From a single set of primers we cannot prove unbiases in our data, however in our case, the
bias is equal across the study. See arguments made above.
