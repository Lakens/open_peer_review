I found the generalization of the Hill numbers interesting, and the approach coherent. A few
comments.
1. For your real example, I found it difficult to see how your analyses might contribute to a better
understanding than already exists concerning industries. In particular, I found it difficult to
relate the estimates to what they imply about industry over that period. This may reflect my lack
of experience of measuring diversity in this context.
2. Related to the above point, I feel that inference is limited given that there is no attempt to
quantify the precision of your diversity measure or its components. It seems to be a common
feature of many diversity papers that measures are estimated, yet no attempt to quantify the
precision of those estimates is made! You describe apparent changes over time but with no basis
for assessing whether those changes are real or simply random (possibly correlated) fluctuations.
3. Concerning fig 1, you state 'the collection that consists of more different features is arguably
more diverse'. However, you could argue that counts of 1,2,2,1,2,1 are more even than
1,1,3,1,1,1,1, and different ways of measuring diversity could legitimately lead to different
conclusions. While your approach is mathematically appealing and offers nice interpretation, it
is not the unique, and probably not the optimal, way to quantify diversity - in fact, I don't believe
there can be a single optimal approach. Different objectives will suggest different ways to
measure diversity.
A final comment is that the draft could do with a final check - there are many typos!

The author studies the measurement of diversity based on three components: variety, balance
and disparity. He proposes a new approach based on similarities of features.
Although I did not check all mathematical formulae, I am convinced that the approach suggested
by the author is worth investigating.
Some remarks
p.2 line 31-33. I was convinced that similarity as used in diversity studies always referred to the
same feature, but the author claims that in the past, when calculating pairwise similarity, this
term has been used for different features, i.e. in pairwise similarity comparisons, different
features have been used. Is this true?
I expected that section 2(c) would end with a formula, or stepwise method, for calculating
diversity. Now, this is hidden in the example 2(d).
In section 3, about the ABC decomposition, nothing is said about the alpha-diversity factor.
About the D(B) factor in this decomposition. The author does not show that this factor is really
variety-independent, i.e. does the same balance and different variety values, always lead to the
same D(B) factor? This observation brings me to another remark. Leinster and Cobbold have a list
of properties which their measure meet. They provide mathematical proofs of this. It is not clear
to me, which of these properties still hold for the measure provided by the author.
A general observation. Other colleagues have proposed a decomposition of diversity, such as
(Chiu & Chao, 2014) and Leydesdorff et al. (2019a), see also Leydesdorff et al. (2019b). The
different influences of variety, balance and disparity on diversity have been studied in (Wang et
al., 2015).
I think these studies should be mentioned and their relation with the author’s work discussed.

acceptance after revision. Both made a number of suggestions; please detail how you have dealt
with these in your re-submission cover letter. Please pay special attention to the following points:

- Please take a more balanced approach to extolling the virtues of this new method. As one
reviewer points out, there is probably no one best measure of diversity - each has positive and
negative sides. Please mention these in your revisions.
- Please do try to deal with the reviewer's point about precision measurement - how might that be
achieved? You may decide not to implement your suggestion, but it should be clear to the reader
how they could do it; please do implement your suggestion if you can, however.
- Please check carefully for typos and other editorial issues before resubmitting. One reviewer
made some specific suggestions, but there are others they did not mention.

I find the methods developed in this paper interesting and potentially very useful. I find the lack
of precision measures disappointing - too many authors of diversity papers draw conclusions
about temporal changes without ever checking whether the estimated changes might be just
random fluctuation. I accept that the changes over the timescale you consider are much greater
than could be explained by chance, but I would have liked to see best practice here! I appreciate
the additional discussion of what your results mean in the case of your example, and accept that a
more inciteful interpretation is inappropriate given the purpose of this paper. I do wonder
whether the choice of example is optimal for bringing your methods to the attention of the
potential user community, but perhaps if there is a follow-up paper, in which for example
methods to quantify precision are developed, then the methods will be of greater value to the
user community, and a biodiversity example might be used to gain a wider audience.

rewrote part of the discussion of the figure and added the Imbs & Wacziarg (2003)
eference to provide context. It should become clear that taking into account disparity may
give additional insight into industrial dynamics, and put into a new light previous results
egarding the relation between diversity and economic development. I also include a
eference to the concept of related variety (Frenken et al., 2007).
2. Related to the above point, I feel that inference is limited given that there is no attempt to

The reviewer is right in their remark – though the variety of features is lower, the balance
of features is higher for the last case in the example. I know do not state which case has a
higher diversity when introducing the example – only that one would expect a higher
diversity for a higher diversity of features. I then come back to this point at the end of
Section 2c), where I state the the diversity as measured by the Hill number is lowest in the
atter case of the example.

The author studies the measurement of diversity based on three components: variety, balance
and disparity. He proposes a new approach based on similarities of features.
Although I did not check all mathematical formulae, I am convinced that the approach suggested
by the author is worth investigating.
Some remarks
p.2 line 31-33. I was convinced that similarity as used in diversity studies always referred to the
same feature, but the author claims that in the past, when calculating pairwise similarity, this term
has been used for different features, i.e. in pairwise similarity comparisons, different
eatures have been used. Is this true?
Here I mean similarity in terms of overlap of features, where the features are represented
as nodes of the ‘feature layer’ in a bipartite network. Thus in the case of words an letters,
each letter is a feature.
The confusion here may be due to the mixed use of the term ‘features’ in the paper. I now
use it consistently, where features are the nodes within one feature set. The section on
multivariate extensions thus considers multiple features sets. Using this terminology, the
eviewer is right in that previous work typically considers one feature set to define
pairwise similarities between types.
reformulated the lines that were on p31-33.
expected that section 2(c) would end with a formula, or stepwise method, for calculating
diversity. Now, this is hidden in the example 2(d).
have tried to address this point without changing the structure of the paper, since I want
o keep the paper accessible on an ‘intuitive level’ up to section 2d), without introducing
notation. I now include equation 2.2 into section 2c) along with paragraph that summarizes
he intuition of the proposed approach.
n section 3, about the ABC decomposition, nothing is said about the alpha-diversity factor.
ndeed, section three is about a decomposition of the number of compositional units into
variety, balance and disparity. The alpha-diversity factor is only used before, for
computation of the beta-diversity (number of compositional units).
About the D(B) factor in this decomposition. The author does not show that this factor is really
variety-independent, i.e. does the same balance and different variety values, always lead to the
same D(B) factor?
D(A) and D(B) are not independent, and they are not claimed to be. I added a paragraph in
which this is clarified, along with a short motivation on why this ok. How to measure
balance is a non-trivial and an interesting question in itself (what would ‘the same balance’
mean in the reviewer’s comment?). I added reference Jost (2010), which provides an in-
depth analysis of measures of balance and their interpretation (including ‘absolute’ versus
relative’ measures of balance).
This observation brings me to another remark. Leinster and Cobbold have a list of properties
which their measure meet. They provide mathematical proofs of this. It is not clear to me, which
of these properties still hold for the measure provided by the author.
have included in the appendix Section B that shows that the number of compositional
units as a measure of diversity satisfies all properties that are posed in Leinster and
Cobbold (2012).
also make mention of this in the main text at the end of section 2c) and in the Discussion.
A general observation. Other colleagues have proposed a decomposition of diversity, such as
Chiu & Chao, 2014) and Leydesdorff et al. (2019a), see also Leydesdorff et al. (2019b). The
different influences of variety, balance and disparity on diversity have been studied in (Wang et
al., 2015).

using alpha and beta diversity to infer disparity) is complementary to the approach of
Chiu & Chao (2014) (including pairwise similarities into Hill number), and that both could
