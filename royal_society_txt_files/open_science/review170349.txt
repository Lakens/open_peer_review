This study explores the interaction of two factors that could potentially influence gaze followng
in dogs: the target of the gaze cue and the context (ostensive/non-ostensive). The authors find
that dogs are more likely to follow gaze to specific objects than into distant space and regardless
of the target, they are more likely to do so when the gaze cue is presented in a communicative
setting. Moreover, interestingly, dogs choices between potential food containers do not
necessarily correlate with gaze following. The study represents a relevant contribution to the field
that helps us gain a better understanding of dogs’ interpretation of communicative actions. The
manuscript is also well-written and intelligible.
The introduction is comprehensive and well-written, however, I would suggest a more precise
clarification of the relevance of the distinction between gaze following into distant space and to
specific objects. As described by the authors, since one could argue that gaze following can be
adaptive due to its ability to signal relevant events and object (including potential danger) in the
environment, this process should not necessarily depend on a priori judgments about the target
of gaze direction. If dogs are more like human infants in this respect than other animal species, an
equally valid prediction could be that the real difference is whether the gaze cue is preceded by
communacitve cues or not, since the communicative context should induce an expectation of
finding something relevant at the cued location - even if one does not know beforehand what it is.
I am not sure I understand why the authors use the terms „Experiment 1 and 2”, when in fact, the
main goal of the study was to compare these two situations, therefore it would be more
appropriate to describe them as two conditions of a single experiment.
Analyses:
1, Reliability for direction of first look – why is it a correlation coefficient instead of Cohen’s
kappa? Is this not a nominal variable (correct/incorrect)? Same goes for Exp 3, for the
correct/incorrect choice, the kappa seems a better index of reliability
2, In certain cases, it seems that some relevant variables were not included in the GLMM or were
not reported (e.g. trial order or dog breed).
3, Regarding the comparison with chance for first looks, I am not convinced that chance can be
properly defined in this case. Dogs could potentially turn their heads in a lot of different
directions that would not qualify as gaze following. Using 50% as chance only seems to make
sense if any head-turn right or left could be considered gaze following. However, this may be too
gross a measure and I am not sure based on the description of coding that it was in fact quite so
liberal.
There are a few factors that make comparisons between Exp 2 and 3 difficult: First, reducing the
time window for gaze following to 5 seconds. To give readers an idea how it affects results, the
avarage latency of gaze following in Exp 2 could be reported. Second, including multiple trials
may also alter dogs looking behavior. Were there any learning effects? It would be nice to see
some data about trial order (this could be included in glmm).
Discussion of Experiment 3: I found the interpretation of the results quite elaborate, however, I
suggest not to separate the discussion of the results of choices in the Non-ostensive condition
from the interpretation of the behavior in the Ostensive condition (the former is discussed in the
interim discussion of Exp 3, while the latter is elaborated on in the General discussion).
Minor comment:
P.11 line 223: The trial name is probably „Single non-ostensive trial” as opposed to „Single
ostensive trial”

Review on the manuscript RSOS-170349 „Do pet dogs (Canis familiaris) follow ostensive and
non- 2 ostensive human gaze to distant space and to objects?” written by Duranton et al.
General comments
This is a well-written and easy-to-understand manuscript. Authors made their goals clear and
embedded their study into a throughout review of relevant literature. The experimental protocol
is mostly sound, the results are clear and the discussion is interesting (although I found it a little
bit lengthy). I had some concerns with the statistical analysis and some of the data
interpretations, which are detailed belos.
Detailed comments
Introduction
The cited reference for the definition of communication (“transfer of information”) is a simplistic
one that makes it difficult for example to take eavesdropping apart from communication.
Maynard-Smith & Harper (1995) gave a more useful definition, including the advantage of the
signaler (through the reaction of the receiver) and the specific evolutionary process involved in
signal evolution.
Procedure
Lines 180-183 – According to Péter et al., (2015 – The Quarterly journal of Experimental
Psychology), when performing 3 consecutive trials, if the experimenter gazes to the same
direction during trials 1 and 2, there is a chance for developing a tendency for perseverative error
in dogs (at least, in case of ostensive cues). Could Authors check whether dogs preferred to
choose the same direction in trial 3 after two identical side trials in trial 1-2 (AAB), compared to
an alternated trial 1-2 design (ABA)?
Line 190 – It is not clear whether the experimenter established eye contact (with ostension) before
each of the three repeated lookings, or only before the first of the three in the ‘Repetitive ostensive
trial’?
Lines 214-215 – Authors write that the warm-up trials served the purpose of teaching the subjects
that “one of the containers” contained food. However, during the warm-ups both containers
contained food. In this case the dogs may learned that BOTH containers contained food, or not?
Statistics
4
Lines 253-254 – It is unusual that Chi-square test was used to test whether dogs’ first look to cue
direction differed from chance level. Why not Binomial test (or maybe one-sample t-test) was
used for this? Interestingly, in case of Experiment 3 Authors have already used one-sample t-test.
Results (Experiments 1-2)
Lines 262-264 – Authors found that “When tested with gaze into distant space, dogs were less
likely to look to either side (N=22 dogs stayed gazing at the experimenter in all of their 3 trials)
than when tested with the two pots (N=5 dogs stayed facing the experimenter)”
I think this result could be explained by the fact that when the two pots are in the room, dogs
may look at one of them independently of the gazing cues given by the experimenter, just
because they found food in the pots during the warm-up trials. In case of the distant space
gazing, there were no pots to look at. This result would be stronger, if pots would been in the
room in case of both experiments, or no-pot control would been performed in the ‘tow pot’
condition. I acknowledge if Authors do not want to re-run some additional trials, however, the
above mentioned possibility should be mentioned.
Experiment 3 / Procedure
Line 435 – The term “Baited container” is probably a mistake, as the containers were empty.
Right?
Line 441 – if the dog did not find food in the indicated container (due to the fact that both
containers were empty), and there were 10 trials, how could we expect that dogs perform along
the experiment with unaltered motivation? Deterioration of performance could be analyzed by
comparing the first half of trials to the last half of them.

Comments to the Author(s)
This study explores the interaction of two factors that could potentially
influence gaze followng in dogs: the target of the gaze cue and the
context (ostensive/non-ostensive). The authors find that dogs are more
likely to follow gaze to specific objects than into distant space and
regardless of the target, they are more likely to do so when the gaze cue
is presented in a communicative setting. Moreover, interestingly, dogs
choices between potential food containers do not necessarily correlate
with gaze following. The study represents a relevant contribution to the
field that helps us gain a better understanding of dogs’ interpretation of
communicative actions. The manuscript is also well-written and
intelligible.
The introduction is comprehensive and well-written, however, I would
suggest a more precise clarification of the relevance of the distinction
between gaze following into distant space and to specific objects. As
described by the authors, since one could argue that gaze following can be
adaptive due to its ability to signal relevant events and object
(including potential danger) in the environment, this process should not
necessarily depend on a priori judgments about the target of gaze
direction. If dogs are more like human infants in this respect than other
animal species, an equally valid prediction could be that the real
difference is whether the gaze cue is preceded by communicative cues or
not, since the communicative context should induce an expectation of
finding something relevant at the cued location - even if one does not
know beforehand what it is.
- We agree with you, and that is why we predicted the importance of
ostensive cues with the gaze. We wrote it in the introduction as follows
“investigate whether repeated cuing and adding ostensive cues to the gaze
cue would improve gaze-following in dogs. We predicted that in both tasks
dogs would perform better after having been addressed and that
administering the gaze cue repeatedly would further improve their
performance”.However, we have now precised it by adding more prediction
LL133-135 in the revised manuscript.
I am not sure I understand why the authors use the terms „Experiment 1 and
2”, when in fact, the main goal of the study was to compare these two
situations, therefore it would be more appropriate to describe them as two
conditions of a single experiment.
- We changed it throughout the manuscript, now we hope it is clearer for
the reader, thank you for your recommendation.
Analyses:
1, Reliability for direction of first look – why is it a correlation
coefficient instead of Cohen’s kappa? Is this not a nominal variable
(correct/incorrect)? Same goes for Exp 3, for the correct/incorrect choice,
the kappa seems a better index of reliability
- We have now provided Cohen’s kappa for the nominal variable “first look
in the gaze cue direction” in all experiments, thank you very much for the
recommendation.
2, In certain cases, it seems that some relevant variables were not
included in the GLMM or were not reported (e.g. trial order or dog breed).
- We have now added data about trial order effects thanks to the other
comment you and reviewer 2 made. Concerning the breed effect, we have not
tested it as we had not breed groups but individuals of various breeds,
you can refer to the table in the supplemental material. However, we agree
that it could be interesting to test in further studies.
3, Regarding the comparison with chance for first looks, I am not
convinced that chance can be properly defined in this case. Dogs could
potentially turn their heads in a lot of different directions that would
not qualify as gaze following. Using 50% as chance only seems to make
sense if any head-turn right or left could be considered gaze following.
However, this may be too gross a measure and I am not sure based on the
description of coding that it was in fact quite so liberal.
- In the two-way object choice task (Experiment 1 Condition 2, and
Experiment 2) chance level was 50% as the dogs could look to one of the
two containers. In the distance space task, we indeed considered right or
left as the two possible gaze direction: indeed, as there was no visible
target to look at, we considered that if the dogs checked in one or the
other side of the room, it was a correct gaze turning answer. We have now
precised it in the methods section, LL250-252 in the revised manuscript.
There are a few factors that make comparisons between Exp 2 and 3
difficult: First, reducing the time window for gaze following to 5 seconds.
To give readers an idea how it affects results, the average latency of
gaze following in Exp 2 could be reported.
- When considering former Experiment 1 condition 2 (former Experiment 2)
in the repetitive communicative trials, we had an average of 3.32 <U+F0B1> 0.40
seconds before the first look. Thus results are comparable with Experiment
2 (former Experiment 3). We have now added this information in the
Supplemental Data, so the reader can have it. Thank you very much for your
recommendation.
Second, including multiple trials may also alter dogs looking behavior.
Were there any learning effects? It would be nice to see some data about
trial order (this could be included in glmm).
- We chose 10 trials as it was not too long to observe an alteration of
dogs’ behaviour. We did not find effect of trial number on dogs’ looking
behaviour and choice. We have now added the data LL472-473 and LL482-483
in the revised manuscript. Thank you for the recommendation.
Discussion of Experiment 3: I found the interpretation of the results
quite elaborate, however, I suggest not to separate the discussion of the
results of choices in the Non-ostensive condition from the interpretation
of the behavior in the Ostensive condition (the former is discussed in the
interim discussion of Exp 3, while the latter is elaborated on in the
General discussion).
- In the Discussion of Experiment 3 (now Experiment 2 in the revised
manuscript) we discussed choices in both condition (non-ostensive as well
as ostensive). However, we agree that we emphasized the discussion
concerning the non-ostensive condition as it is the main innovative result
of our experiments. Additionally, we agree that mainly discussed the
ostensive part of gaze-following in the general discussion, as we take
into perspective all experiments (Experiment 1 conditions 1 and 2, and
Experiment 2) thus we thought that the very best was to discuss it in the
general discussion. However, if you still have comments regarding the
discussion order, please let us know.

Lines 180-183 – According to Péter et al., (2015 – The Quarterly journal
of Experimental Psychology), when performing 3 consecutive trials, if the
experimenter gazes to the same direction during trials 1 and 2, there is a
chance for developing a tendency for perseverative error in dogs (at least,
in case of ostensive cues). Could Authors check whether dogs preferred to
choose the same direction in trial 3 after two identical side trials in
trial 1-2 (AAB), compared to an alternated trial 1-2 design (ABA)?
- We have checked: when considering only dogs who had identical side trial
1-2 and who made a look (n=26), in trial 3 (side was always different -
thus following the gaze cue means do not choose the same side than before)
only 6 dogs did not follow the gaze cue direction. Thus 20 dogs followed
the gaze cue and did not choose the same direction than in the previous
trials. We thus do not observe the tendency for perseverative error as
found in Peter et al., 2015. We propose that it is due to the fact that in
Experiment 1, dogs were not released to go and find a target, contrary to
what the authors did in Peter et al., 2015. If you want us to include this
into the manuscript or supplemental information, please let us know, thank
you very much.
Line 190 – It is not clear whether the experimenter established eye
contact (with ostension) before each of the three repeated lookings, or
only before the first of the three in the ‘Repetitive ostensive trial’?
- We have mentioned it just the sentence after: before each look, the
experimenter addressed the dogs in the same way, so with eye contact +
calling the dog’s name.
Lines 214-215 – Authors write that the warm-up trials served the purpose
of teaching the subjects that “one of the containers” contained
food. However, during the warm-ups both containers contained food. In
this case the dogs may learned that BOTH containers contained food, or not?
- Yes you are right. We have now modified the sentence according to your
comment, thank you very much.
Statistics
Lines 253-254 – It is unusual that Chi-square test was used to test
whether dogs’ first look to cue direction differed from chance level. Why
not Binomial test (or maybe one-sample t-test) was used for this?
Interestingly, in case of Experiment 3 Authors have already used one-
sample t-test.
- We have now presented comparison with chance level with t-test for all
experiments, thank you very much for your advice.
Results (Experiments 1-2)
Lines 262-264 – Authors found that “When tested with gaze into distant
space, dogs were less likely to look to either side (N=22 dogs stayed
gazing at the experimenter in all of their 3 trials) than when tested with
the two pots (N=5 dogs stayed facing the experimenter)”
I think this result could be explained by the fact that when the two pots
are in the room, dogs may look at one of them independently of the gazing
cues given by the experimenter, just because they found food in the pots
during the warm-up trials. In case of the distant space gazing, there were
no pots to look at. This result would be stronger, if pots would been in
the room in case of both experiments, or no-pot control would been
performed in the ‘tow pot’ condition. I acknowledge if Authors do not want
to re-run some additional trials, however, the above mentioned possibility
should be mentioned.
- Thank you very much for the recommendation. We are indeed not able to
re-run the experiments, thus we have mentioned it in the discussion LL351-
353 in the revised manuscript.
Experiment 3 / Procedure
Line 435 – The term “Baited container” is probably a mistake, as the
containers were empty. Right?
- Yes you are right, we have now corrected it by replacing “baited” with
“predefined”, thank you very much for your comment.
Line 441 – if the dog did not find food in the indicated container (due to
the fact that both containers were empty), and there were 10 trials, how
could we expect that dogs perform along the experiment with unaltered
motivation? Deterioration of performance could be analyzed by comparing
the first half of trials to the last half of them.
- At first we conducted 20 trials and then for the exact same reason you
mentioned we observed deterioration of performance due to a lack of
motivation/tiredness of the dogs. Thus we checked and observed that during
the 10 first trials there was no lack of motivation, all dogs always went
to a container. We did not find any trial number effect, as mentioned to
reviewer 1. We have now added the data LL472-473 and LL482-483 in the
revised manuscript, thank you very much for the recommendation.

We are really grateful for your comments and we hope that this revised
version will fulfil your expectations for final publication.
