The current paper examines the association between personality and participation and
performance on touchscreen tasks in a sample of 19 chimpanzees (11 females, 8 males) ranging in
age from 14 to 50 years. Although the focus of this research is important and the study idea is
likely of interest to many, myself included, the very small sample size raises large concerns for
me with regard to the replicability and meaning of these findings (the large CIs raise further
concerns). Given the replication crisis we are currently facing in science, I am concerned with the
ethics of publishing findings based on such small samples, except in very rare circumstances. I do
not see this being one of those circumstances given the number of studies published within the
nonhuman primate personality literature within the past few years with substantially larger
samples (i.e., Ns in the hundreds) including samples of chimpanzees.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This manuscript addresses an important and timely topic in primate psychology. I support the
authors’ goals of conducting systematic behavioral research on apes and of exploring the
constructs of personality and intellect across species. The authors and their institutions have
invested considerable time and effort to establish the touchscreen testing hardware and software
and to collect the data reported here.
I recommend that the authors provide more information about their testing methods, as noted
below. The paper does not give enough detail regarding methods to allow me to evaluate the
findings. For example, it is not clear what the different touchscreen tests consist of at a detailed
level or what the tests are measuring. It is not clear what the social context of testing was or how
3
the social context might have influenced performance. The dimensions of “intellect” and the
testing situation are not especially well characterized.
In general, the report emphasizes the similarities in chimpanzee and human personality findings.
In the Discussion section, I felt that the equating of chimpanzee and human findings sometimes
(e.g. lines 259-261; 269-217; 282-284) got in the way of analyzing and explaining the chimpanzee
case.
Specific comments
Line 73 “performance can depend on an individual’s development” – please be more specific
about what aspect of “development” is relevant here
Line 91 Rhesus macaques’ performance has been associated…. Performance on what?
Line 92-95 This passage should spell out the link between “personality” and “spending more time
on a task”.
Lines 96-97 This passage emphasizes the evolutionary origins of “intellect,” but what is being
discussed is the relation of intellect to personality variables. This could be made more clear.
Line 100. Say more about how personality was measured in 2010 and whether this was done
independently of touchscreen tasks.
Line 103. At some point in the methods, explain in detail how response time was determined.
Line 107. What type of experience?
Line 109. Do you make a distinction between “expertise” and “experience”? Give some
clarification of “expertise”.
Line 111. …where reinforcement is not provided…. Suggested alternative: where food reinforcers
[or: food rewards] are not provided…
Line 119. Clarify whether the entire group was given access to the apparatus simultaneously. Are
animals able to monopolize the apparatus in all 3 studies? Do some animals sit by the apparatus
and take the food while other animals attempt to work? Etc.
Line 126 Again, it should be made clear to the reader whether chimpanzees were tested
individually or in a social group
Lines 126-132 Give details of the testing methods and stimulus presentation. This section is quite
abstract and unspecific.
Line 135 acoustic reinforcement – use a more descriptive phrase; and give some idea of the food
reward used
Line 140 explain what the “testing phase” consisted of
Line 144 how was “participation” measured? The ape sat next to the touchscreen? Touched the
screen at least once? Or what?
Lines 144-150 To interpret these results, I would want to know more about the social context of
testing. Was there competition for access to the apparatus? Did the worker typically get the food
item that was produced? If participation was a function of both the social setting and personality
variables, how are these factors taken into account jointly?
4
Lines 155-158 same comment as the preceding
Line 170 How was reaction time measured? How many touches per trial? There is not enough
information in the Methods to know what was measured.
Lines 181-183 Is this statement meant to refer to all studies, including study 1?
Line 192 clarify what is meant by “no repetition of trials” (I assume that there was no correction
procedure)
Lines 192-193 Clarify “collected ordinal data on the chimpanzees’ daily presence in the research
areas.” I cannot tell what was measured.
Line 195 Clarify what “engagement data” consisted of
Line 199 Please give some idea of the level of accuracy on the tasks
Line 213 “result in the participant being rewarded” – please be more specific about what the
reward was
Lines 216-217 “progressive training” – please clarify
Line 219 “11 days of testing began” – please explain what “testing” consisted of. What is the task?
Were there predictions?
Line 219 What are the “pods”?
Lines 227-232 It is not clear what “completing the training” is measuring if there were no wrong
answers. Willingness to touch the screen? Interest in the touchscreen when foods were available
elsewhere in the pod?
Lines 149-150 “intellectual and non-intellectual capacities” – due to the lack of information about
methods, I don’t feel that these have been well characterized
Lines 274-277 there is some relevant research on differential learning patterns by high- and low-
ranking macaques and by macaques with differing forms of early experience. Thus, this
statement could be toned down.

Dear Dr Altschul:
I write you in regards to manuscript RSOS-160881 entitled "Chimpanzee Intellect: Personality,
Performance, and Motivation with Touchscreen Tasks" which you submitted to Royal Society
Open Science.
In view of the criticisms of the reviewers and editors, found at the bottom of this letter, your
manuscript has been rejected for publication.

Reviewers were concerned principally with sample size, as well as wishing further elaborations
of parts of the protocol and methods. This is obviously very interesting work, with carefully
conducted and well-reported analyses. Our concern over the low statistical power drives the
decision on this paper. We hope that this research either finds an alternative home or joins
another sample.

This paper is both interesting and beautifully written.
Reviewer 2 asks for mean levels of accuracy to be reported in studies 1 and 2. Please can you do
this?
I noticed a typo on page 14 line 325 "feel" is intended to be "fall" ?
The sample size is smaller among studies of non human primates, but this is a reasonably large
study of its kind. The power is clearly elaborated, the design is easy to follow and the results area
clear and discussed sensibly. It is a very nice piece of work.

the main text for studies 1 and 2. The mean scores are potentially of interest to researchers who
are using similar cognitive tasks with nonhuman primates.

r Editor:
co-authors and I wish to raise our concerns regarding the review of manuscript RSOS-160881.
ile we greatly appreciate the comments and insights provided by the reviewers and yourself, we
e given the impression that some decision-relevant issues raised were not grounded in fact. In
ticular reviewer 1 appeared to dismiss our research based on misleading arguments. Below we
uld like to address their claims about statistical power, which you cited as the reason for
cting our manuscript.
iewer 1 states that large sample size (n) personality studies have been recently conducted in
mpanzees and that the comparably smaller sample size in our work diminishes its scientific
ificance. However, our research is not comparable to these studies: although we have included
relational variables in our study, our research employed an experimental approach, while the
e n studies in question are based on observational data. The only large n experimental studies
t we are aware of are Hermann et al. (2009) (n = 106) and Hopkins et al. (2014) (n = 99).
ther of these studies used touchscreen devices, and only a single round of testing was carried
per participant and task, while our experiments collected repeated measures. Experimental
dies comparable to ours, such as those by Inoue and Matsuzawa (2007) and Martin et al. (2014)
chimpanzees (both n = 6), and that by Blanchette et al. (2016) on baboons (n = 14), all involve
er subjects.
h respect to the question of statistical power, our study involves three distinct tasks, made up of
usands to tens of thousands of trials, each. It is incorrect to consider only the number of
ticipants in repeated measures designs such as ours (Liu & Liang, 1997; Moerbeek et al., 2008).
ur mixed model framework, the number of trials and number of days gives additional power to
analyses, though this power is attenuated because observations within individuals are
related. Nonetheless, accurate power analyses can be carried out with simulations (e.g., with the
ackage ‘simr’). Given the reviewer’s concerns we ran such simulations for our data and would
to present these results here briefly to dispel doubts concerning the strength of our data – we
happy to share the R code if requested.
simulations determined, for example, that the power to detect an effect of Openness in our base
del of performance in study 1 was 49%. In study 2 the power to detect the significant effect
nness in our base model of performance was notably higher: 60%. While these power values do
reach the gold standard of 80%, they are far from unreasonable given the limitations of
erimental cognition research with zoo-housed great apes. The statistical power of our analyses
also be contrasted with meta-analytic assessments of median power in psychological science
kker et al., 2012) (35%) and in neuroscience (Button et al., 2013) (22%). Further simulations
indicated that low power was not characteristic of our studies. For example, our observed
er to detect the significant effects of Openness and Extraversion on the amount of time spent
racting with the screen exceeded 90%. Altogether, our design seems capable of detecting the
cts we identify. Our study and data are not without limitations, and where uncertainty exists,
power of our analyses can be reported, as we can easily include the results of all these
ulations in the manuscript. Finally, in addition to calculating power, it is worth noting that we
ady appropriately adjusted our family-wise error rate to account for inflation of type I false
itive errors, as mentioned on lines 149-150 and 231-232 of the current manuscript.
Royal Society’s laudable open data policies are another crucial protection against unethical
earch, as future researchers can check our work or reanalyze the data with alternative
roaches. Thus, our acknowledgment of the limitations of these data and open publication of
se data is crucial to resolving a long-standing issue which is as pernicious as the replication
is: the file-drawer problem.
rall, we are led to conclude that reviewer 1 did not appear to have offered a full review of our
rk, and we feel that this is intellectually dishonest. However, in light of our response, including
additional power analyses, we respectfully ask that you reconsider your decision, and assign a
erent reviewer to our manuscript. We believe that Open Science would be an excellent venue to
lish our findings and therefore hope for further consideration of our manuscript.

e would like to thank the editor for the reviews of this manuscript, and for reappraising our
nuscript in light of our initial replies to these reviews. In this resubmission, we have revised the

current paper examines the association between personality and participation and performance on
chscreen tasks in a sample of 19 chimpanzees (11 females, 8 males) ranging in age from 14 to 50
rs. Although the focus of this research is important and the study idea is likely of interest to many,
elf included, the very small sample size raises large concerns for me with regard to the replicability
meaning of these findings (the large CIs raise further concerns). Given the replication crisis we are
ently facing in science, I am concerned with the ethics of publishing findings based on such small
ples, except in very rare circumstances. I do not see this being one of those circumstances given the
ber of studies published within the nonhuman primate personality literature within the past few
rs with substantially larger samples (i.e., Ns in the hundreds) including samples of chimpanzees.
e share the reviewer’s concerns about power, and have conducted simulations to estimate the
er of our models, where it was appropriate. Though our subject pool was limited, we were perhaps
clear: most of our models incorporate massed trials numbering in the hundreds to thousands.

stated in our revision, mean power was between 67% and 89% for all significant effects that we
nd. While not all of our results met the gold standard of 80% power, given the limitations placed on
e.g., because of practical and ethical considerations we had no control over how many chimpanzees
se to participate and little control over how many trials a participant engages in, these power figures
reasonable.

ments to the Author(s)
manuscript addresses an important and timely topic in primate psychology. I support the authors’
ls of conducting systematic behavioral research on apes and of exploring the constructs of
sonality and intellect across species. The authors and their institutions have invested considerable
e and effort to establish the touchscreen testing hardware and software and to collect the data
orted here.
commend that the authors provide more information about their testing methods, as noted below.
paper does not give enough detail regarding methods to allow me to evaluate the findings. For
mple, it is not clear what the different touchscreen tests consist of at a detailed level or what the
s are measuring. It is not clear what the social context of testing was or how the social context might
e influenced performance. The dimensions of “intellect” and the testing situation are not especially
l characterized.
e appreciate the author’s insight, and expanded the text in response to this comment, as well as
ilar comments below. In particular, we added more detail to describe the experimental tasks, and
social context of all experiments. It is worth noting that the context was equivalent for all tasks:
arating individuals was impossible in this enclosure, but allowing testing in a group setting is not
ommon practice.
eneral, the report emphasizes the similarities in chimpanzee and human personality findings. In the
ussion section, I felt that the equating of chimpanzee and human findings sometimes (e.g. lines 259-
; 269-217; 282-284) got in the way of analyzing and explaining the chimpanzee case.
e appreciate the reviewer’s concern, though we are hesitant to withdraw our comparisons.
mpanzee personality closely resembles human personality, and moreover, our inventory is
oretically and methodologically linked with the literature on human personality. Because of these
ilarities, and the vast body of relevant and meta-analysed results linking achievement, intellect, and
sonality in humans, we felt it was crucial to acknowledge when our findings agreed and disagreed
h the human evidence.
cific comments
73 “performance can depend on an individual’s development” – please be more specific about what
ect of “development” is relevant here
e have amended this sentence to be clear that we are specifically referring to animals’ experience
h cognitive tasks (lines 74-76).
91 Rhesus macaques’ performance has been associated…. Performance on what?
e have clarified this statement to refer to performance on a touchscreen task (line 95).
92-95 This passage should spell out the link between “personality” and “spending more time on a
”.
e have amended this passage to further explain the link between personality, experience, and
formance (lines 97 – 101).
s 96-97 This passage emphasizes the evolutionary origins of “intellect,” but what is being discussed is
relation of intellect to personality variables. This could be made more clear.
e have amended this sentence to highlight this relationship (lines 102 – 106).
100. Say more about how personality was measured in 2010 and whether this was done
pendently of touchscreen tasks.
e have added material to the methods to further describe key details of the personality ratings (lines
, 135 - 140). Full details are available in the supplement.
103. At some point in the methods, explain in detail how response time was determined.
e have added this information, see the results section of study 1 (lines 216 - 218).
107. What type of experience?
e have added to this section to clarify that we refer to experience on these cognitive tasks (line 113 -
).
109. Do you make a distinction between “expertise” and “experience”? Give some clarification of
pertise”.
is not necessary to use “expertise” here. We have changed it to “experience” to simplify the
agraph.
111. …where reinforcement is not provided…. Suggested alternative: where food reinforcers [or:
d rewards] are not provided…
e have amended the text as has been suggested.
119. Clarify whether the entire group was given access to the apparatus simultaneously. Are animals
to monopolize the apparatus in all 3 studies? Do some animals sit by the apparatus and take the
d while other animals attempt to work? Etc.
e have added text to the methods to clarify the reviewer’s questions about our experimental setup
the behaviour of the chimpanzees (lines 127 – 134).
126 Again, it should be made clear to the reader whether chimpanzees were tested individually or in
cial group
e made changes throughout the manuscript to indicate that the entire group of chimpanzees always
access to the research areas.
s 126-132 Give details of the testing methods and stimulus presentation. This section is quite
tract and unspecific.
e have heavily expanded our descriptions of the experimental task in study 1 (lines 145 – 163).
135 acoustic reinforcement – use a more descriptive phrase; and give some idea of the food reward
d
e have added information to better describe the positive reinforcers we used (lines 168 – 173).
140 explain what the “testing phase” consisted of
e have added material to explain more about the test phase of experiment 1 (lines 177 – 183).
144 how was “participation” measured? The ape sat next to the touchscreen? Touched the screen at
t once? Or what?
e have added text to explain that participating chimpanzees completed more than a session worth
rials (and in all cases, many more trials than the minimum; lines 187 - 190).
s 144-150 To interpret these results, I would want to know more about the social context of testing.
s there competition for access to the apparatus? Did the worker typically get the food item that was
duced? If participation was a function of both the social setting and personality variables, how are
se factors taken into account jointly?
cept in rare cases, the worker interacted with the apparatus alone. Other chimps might have been
rby, as they enjoy resting in the research pods, bedding areas, and tunnels nearby, but again, except
are cases, the worker was not interfered with and received the food reward given out by the
aratus, so we did not have any compelling evidence to suggest that social setting affected
formance. We have adjusted the manuscript here and elsewhere to give more information on these
related issues raised in several comments (lines 129 – 134).
s 155-158 same comment as the preceding
ease see our reply to the above comment.
170 How was reaction time measured? How many touches per trial? There is not enough
rmation in the Methods to know what was measured.
single response time was collected from a single touch on each trial; we have added material to
lain this, as well as our measurement of response time (lines 216 – 218).
s 181-183 Is this statement meant to refer to all studies, including study 1?
udy 1 took place in the off-show areas of the enclosure, whereas studies 2 and 3 took place in the
icated research areas of the enclosure, which were viewable to visitors. Otherwise, the process was
same. We have added text to the methods for study 1 and 2 (lines 229 – 234) to clarify these
erences.
192 clarify what is meant by “no repetition of trials” (I assume that there was no correction
cedure)
at is correct, there was no correction procedure. We have added text to reflect this (lines 244 –
).
s 192-193 Clarify “collected ordinal data on the chimpanzees’ daily presence in the research areas.” I
not tell what was measured.
e have copied and amended text from the supplement, and we now describe the specifics of the
agement data, which refers to the same data on the chimpanzees’ presence in the research pod
es 246 -251).
195 Clarify what “engagement data” consisted of
ease see the above comment.
199 Please give some idea of the level of accuracy on the tasks
e have added the range of accuracies to the text in these section for studies 1 (lines 209 - 211) and 2
es 256 - 259). All but two chimpanzees performed above chance.
213 “result in the participant being rewarded” – please be more specific about what the reward was
dividuals were always rewarded with a piece of grape. We have added this to our text (lines 281 –
).
s 216-217 “progressive training” – please clarify
is was meant to refer to the previous 12 days of training on phases 1 through 5. We have clarified
in the text (lines 284 – 286).
219 “11 days of testing began” – please explain what “testing” consisted of. What is the task? Were
e predictions?
e have added content to explain how the testing task relates to the earlier training task; it is
entially the same, except rewards were not given out by the task, but rather, freely available on the
rs of the research areas (lines 288 – 292). The predictions were as stated in the introduction: where
forcement is not provided by the task, individuals higher in Openness will participate more.
219 What are the “pods”?
e pods refer to the same space as the on-show research areas. We have added material to the
ier methods section to clarify this (line 230).
s 227-232 It is not clear what “completing the training” is measuring if there were no wrong
wers. Willingness to touch the screen? Interest in the touchscreen when foods were available
where in the pod?
oth interest in the touchscreen task and desire for rewards were likely at play in those chimpanzees
rested in the apparatus during the training phases, but the differences were not significant, so we
not feel it was appropriate to interpret them. However, foods were not available elsewhere in the
during training, only testing.
s 149-150 “intellectual and non-intellectual capacities” – due to the lack of information about
hods, I don’t feel that these have been well characterized
aid reader comprehension, we have added a few key examples of intellectual and non-intellectual
acities to the beginning of the discussion (lines 329 - 331).
s 274-277 there is some relevant research on differential learning patterns by high- and low- ranking
caques and by macaques with differing forms of early experience. Thus, this statement could be toned
n.
e have included additional discussion of some relevant work with macaques, and scaled back our
ements about dominance and non-social cognition (lines 358 – 365).
