In the paper “Effect of Polyamide 6 on the Morphology and Electrical Conductivity of Carbon
Black-Filled Polypropylene Composites”, Wu et al reported their studies on the structure and
properties of PP/PA/CB systems compared with PP/CB system. Although CB filled conductive
polymer composites, including CB filled polymer blend composites have been studied for a long
time, the paper contains some interesting results can could be considered for publication after
revision on the following points.
1. The aim and the novelty of the paper should be more carefully shaped and presented. As is
known, to reduce the percolation threshold, another polymer component can be incorporated to
construct a so-called double percolation system; in a double percolation system, if the minor
polymer component can be reduced in volume and the co-continuous morphology can be still
maintained, the percolation threshold can be further reduced, leading to enhanced conductivity
and better mechanical performance. These facts have been well revealed in literatures. So, the
novelty and the aim of the work should be further considered and described.
2. In the abstract, “The addition of PA6 promoted the morphological change from a typical sea-
island morphology to a co-continuous morphology.” is hard to understand. Without PA, we
generally do not say there is a sea-island morphology.
3. “The concept of double percolation was first observed by Sumita” should be corrected into
“The concept of double percolation was first put forward by Sumita”.
4. What is the meaning of “a technical polymer”?
5. MRI should be MFR and should be defined.
6. In sample preparation, the cooling condition of the samples should be given because PP and
PA are crystalline polymers and the cooling conditions greatly influenced the crystalline
structures and the final properties.
7. “The test program was raised from room temperature to 250°C at a heating rate of 20°C/min,
and after a period of 5 min it was swept back to 40°C at 10°C/min in order to erase the thermal
history.” Should be revised.
8. before and after etched? after etching.
9. The reasons for the formation of “ (a) microfibrillar structure and (b) micro-pore structure”
should be discussed.
10. The paper should be carefully proofed to avoid any expression errors.
11. Some recent publications closely related with this work, such as, Composites Science and
Technology, 2017, 139, 17-25; Polymer, 2017, 110, 1-11; Composites Part B, 2016, 99, 348-357,

The manuscrpt deal with the development of conducting composites by using heterogeneous
polymer blend as a matrix. The manuscript is well written and well discussed. There are few
typing mistakes to be corrected.
I would like to address some comments andQor questions to the authors:
1) regarding the surface tension at higher temperature,I suggest the uthors to include some more
explanation such as the definition of dx and so on in the formulae.
2) related to the viscosity discussion, there are an increase in viscosity as the amount of PA6
increases up to 30% and then decrease. Why?
The author affirm that the presence of CB in the PA6 phase decrease the viscosity. I did not
understand.

systems compared with PP/CB system. Although CB filled conductive polymer composites, including CB

#Response to Reviewer 1:
Firstly, thank you very much for your comments and advice, from which I can make great progress.
Some revision has been made in the manuscript in red font.
1. The novelty and the aim of the work have been presented in part “Introduction”. To our knowledge,
most reports have discussed the effect of the CB content on the electrical property of PP/PA6 composites
(at a certain PP/PA6 ratio) up to now. However, few have been found about the specific influence of the
different ratio of PA6 and PA6/PP on the microstructure and electrical property of polymer blends at the
same CB loading. In this work, we not only figure out the relations between the different phase content
and the resulting properties, but also make a combination of the theoretical calculation and experiment.
2. For the PP/PA6 (90/10) and PP/PA6 (80/20) blend filled with 8 wt% CB, the PA6 was a discrete minor
phase dispersed in a continuous PP phase matrix, i.e., a typical sea-island morphology. For the
composites of PP/PA6 (70/30), PP/PA6 (60/40) and PP/PA6 (50/50), the phase structure of the system
changed obviously, forming a continuous structure. What I intend to express is that “with the increase
amount of PA6, the morphological change from a typical sea-island morphology to a co-continuous
morphology”. I am very sorry for not express clearly. The sentence in the abstract has been improved.
3. “The concept of double percolation was first observed by Sumita” in the notice has been revised to
“The concept of double percolation was first put forward by Sumita”.
4. “a technical polymer” in this article means “an engineering polymer”, a group of plastic materials that
have better mechanical and/or thermal properties than the more widely used commodity plastics. To
avoid misunderstanding, it has been changed to “an engineering polymer”.
5. MRI in the notice has been revised to MFR and been defined.
6. The cooling condition has been added in the part “Sample Preparation”.
7. The sentence has been revised to “At first, the samples were heated from room temperature to 250°C
at a heating rate of 20°C/min and melted at 250°C for 5 min to erase any thermal history, then cooled
down to 40°C at a cooling rate of 10°C/min.”.
8. “Before and after etched” in the notice has been revised to “before and after etching”.
9. The reasons for the formation of “(a) microfibrillar structure and (b) micro-pore structure” have been
added in part “Morphologies of the PP/PA6/CB composites”. As PP and PA6 are immiscible and
incompatible, the low interfacial adhesion leads to the extraction of PA6 phase during the process of
fracture in liquid nitrogen. Thus, the morphologies formed two parts: (a) microfibrillar structure and (b)
micro-pore structure.
10. We are very sorry for our expression errors in this article, and we have checked and revised the
essay carefully.
11. Some recent publications related have been cited.
Thanks again for your valuable suggestions.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript deal with the development of conducting composites by using heterogeneous polymer
blend as a matrix. The manuscript is well written and well discussed. There are few typing mistakes to
be corrected.
I would like to address some comments and/or questions to the authors:
1) regarding the surface tension at higher temperature, I suggest the authors to include some more
explanation such as the definition of dx and so on in the formulae.
2) related to the viscosity discussion, there are an increase in viscosity as the amount of PA6 increases
up to 30% and then decrease. Why?
The author affirm that the presence of CB in the PA6 phase decrease the viscosity. I did not
understand.
#Response to Reviewer 2:
Firstly, special thanks to you for your professional comments.
1) More explanation of the symbols in the formula have been added in part “Theoretical calculation of
the location of CB in the PP/PA6 blends” marked in blue font.
2) Although the linear viscoelastic behavior of the polymer matrix composites mainly depends on the
properties of the polymer matrix materials, the structure of the CB particles leads to some special
properties of the composite system to a certain extent. When the content of PA6 is low, CB is dispersed,
the spacing between particles is too large to form the network structure. What plays a dominant role in
viscosity is the entanglement characteristics between polymer matrixes. The viscosity of the whole
system increases with the PA6 content increases. When the content of PA6 exceeds 30 wt%, the co-
continuous structure lead to the form of conductive network which affects the movement of the polymer.
At this point, the network structure becomes a dominant role. Because of the selective dispersion of CB
particles in the PA6 phase, when wCB is kept the same (8 wt% of the whole system), as PA6 content in
these composites is increased, the relative content of CB in PA6 phase decreases. Thus leading to a
decrease in viscosity of the PA6 phase and the whole system.
Thanks again for your comments.
