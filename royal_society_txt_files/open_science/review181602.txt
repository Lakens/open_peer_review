Semiconductor nanocrystal (NC) plays important roles in solar cells. In this paper, the authors
synthesized monodisperse copper telluride and changed the ratio of oleylamine to stearic acid to
study the morphology of final products. Various characterizations were executed to study the
structure and composition, and the results could be interest in the readers of Royal Society Open
Science. The manuscript can be accepted after a minor revision. Below are my comments:
1. The specific graph order (like a, b…) should be provided in every Figure, to make reading
convenient for the readers.
2. In Page 2, Line 48, “The stoichiometric ratio of the particles in this sample was observed to be
Cu2.26Te2 by EDX measurements”, the corresponding EDX pattern needs to be offered.

Dear editor,
The manuscript “Sulfur-Free Synthesis of Size Tunable Rickardite (Cu3-xTe2) Spheroids and
Planar Squares” has reported a method to synthesize Cu3-xTe2 nanoparticles in shapes of
Spheroids and Planar Squares. It is claimed tuning the amount of oleylamine as the coordinating
ligand is the key to tune the nanoparticle shapes from spheroids to planar squares. The pros of
this work is that the TEM images have proved such evaluation process, however, the presented
method cannot considered as novel method, since it is slightly different than the methods from
previous literature (Inorg. Chem. 2018, 57, 10241-10248; Nature Comm. volume 8, Article
3
number: 14925 (2017)) and show not much improvement. And the resulted nanoparticles are
hardly considered as monodispersed especially for the ones in shape of planar squares (in Figure
4). Adding oleylamine seems to be able to cause the shape evolution, however, loss control of
nanoparticle monidispersity and uniformity. Further study to find a better coordinating ligand is
recommended.

Response to Referees
Thank you very much for your professional comments. All advices are very
important to our studies. These suggestions have great guiding significance for
our academic writing and scientific research. We have modified the manuscript
accordingly, and the detailed corrections are listed below point by point for the
reviewers’ comments as following:

make reading convenient for the readers.
Response:
The graph order has been provided and revised in every Figure in the
manuscript.
2. In Page 2, Line 48, “The stoichiometric ratio of the particles in this sample
was observed to be Cu2.26Te2 by EDX measurements”, the corresponding EDX
pattern needs to be offered.
Response:
The stoichiometric ratio of the particles in this sample is added and demonstrated
in Table 1.

(in Figure 4). Adding oleylamine seems to be able to cause the shape evolution,
however, loss control of nanoparticle monidispersity and uniformity. Further
study to find a better coordinating ligand is recommended.
Response:
Thanks for your valuable comments. In this manuscript, the oleylamine is
employed to control the morphology of Cu3-xTe2 nanoparticles. We have
carefully searched and read the relevant literature and cited (1) Enrico M, Mauro

Inspired by your valuable the suggestion, and we plan to run large number
of experiments by using different coordinating ligand on this reaction. Thank you
again for this valuable suggestion which have greatly inspired us and brought us
new ideas and new research directions.
