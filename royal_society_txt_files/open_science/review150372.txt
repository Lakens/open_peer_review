The introduction is a particularly clear summary of the authors’ collective theorizing about sperm
whale social communication and its relationship to sperm whale sociality. Although it is more
general than the topic of the paper, it is succinct and well-written, and lays the groundwork for
the Discussion as well as the Methods and Results.
The authors have put a lot of thought into their analysis based on a large body of previous
literature on the same topic. They have examined different aspects of their data using multiple,
sometimes similar, statistical procedures. However, the rationale for the steps they took isn’t
explicitly laid out, and is particularly difficult to follow because critical information is split out in
the electronic supplement and previous papers that used different analysis methods. It would
help to have a paragraph at the start of the section, maybe with a diagram, that lays out the
strategy for the analysis – the breakdown between categorical and continuous, a summary of the
variables were entered into the analyses, the procedures they used for classifying, ordering,
clustering, etc. This paragraph/diagram should help readers gain confidence in their approach.
The discussion does not suggest how uncertainties in their methods might affect their
conclusions, and this should be included. For example, the range of sample periods/samples
among units and individuals is large. Might this have affected their results or blurred the
distinctions among some codas by unit/individual?
The authors say they have provided evidence for vocal complexity matching the social
complexity of sperm whales. The discussion (beginning on line 269) talks about the importance
of understanding how the whales produce and use layers of complexity. However, the authors
do not talk about how their findings relate to complexity in other species. In the absence of
detail, it is hard to know whether the complexity of sperm whale codas is really directly
comparable to other literature on vocal complexity. I know that this paper is not a review of the
social complexity hypothesis, but since they have invoked it, I think some additional detail is
justified. How would their interpretation of the hypothesis differ, for example, from that of
Leuchtenberger et al. (2014), which provides a more traditional terrestrial view of complexity?

repertoire of the social giant otter. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 136(5): 2861-2875.
Specific Comments (by line number):
9: Something missing or a comma incorrect (….recorded, were….)
30-34: I don’t think the leap from large spatial scale to adaptive pressure for social learning is
justified as stated. Pressures of social competition within and across group and species could
explain the complexity of cetacean social communication as well or better than habitat structure -
remember that social odontocetes must deal with a complex clade of other large, wide ranging,
sometimes irascible, and in at least one case predatory, social odontocetes. Great mobility
increases the complexities of using the habitat, yes, but any or all of a number of mechanisms
could be operating. The last sentence could just as well follow the first.
108: If the classification of click patterns is highly reliable, there should be a statement to that
effect with reference(s). If there were ambiguous cases, how were they resolved?
150: Which variants of distance measure (Euclidean, etc.) were tested and how would distance
have affected the multivariate similarity if the codas hadn’t been distinctive in the way they
3
expected? In other words, to what degree was robustness with regard to the distance measure
supportive of their results?
164: The observation that the codas did not change significantly over time is mentioned as an
aside. However, this invariance is the driving phenomenon behind the degree of individual, unit,
etc. specificity they found in their analysis; so, it would make sense to discuss it earlier in the
results section, and maybe provide a table or figure about change over time in the codas they
studied. This is particularly important given the discussion starting on line 278.
188: A word is missing in this sentence (they also ??? in their usage of coda types..)
229: If the SE values were put in parentheses, the comparison would be clearer.
255: Is there any information about the genetic distances among the units? The population in the
area of their study was exploited historically.
269-271: I would add to the list of properties the following: the capacity to produce vocal signals
with sufficient stereotypy (not the same as being able to identify them). Their findings suggest
that sperm whales must be able to retain an accurate template in memory and to emit sounds
using it for very long periods.
278: Make the text about discrimination vs. identification into a separate paragraph.

produced a high proportion of 5R1 codas, and yet this is one of the 2 codas uniformly used with
high proportion in their clan of Dominican social units. Is there any indication that this whale is
special? Say whether the same pattern was found in other units.

This is a very interesting paper, which uses an impressively extensive dataset to tackle questions
about how vocal signals in sperm whales advertise successive levels of social affiliation –
specifically clan and social unit membership as well as individual identity. This sort of study is
rarely possible in large mammals and by using their unique dataset and powerful analysis
methods the authors have been able to break new ground here and their findings should be of
wide interest.
My comments for how the manuscript could be improved revolve around clarifying particular
arguments and some restructuring to highlight key results – a little work on these aspects would
significantly strengthen this interesting manuscript. I hope my suggestions are useful:
1) I think the title could be usefully changed to “Distinctive modes of variation in sperm whale
codas reflect social unit membership and vocal clan affiliation as well as individual identity”.
This would stress more what is new/unique about the paper.
2) Line 4 “broadest structures” is rather unclear here – change to affiliative structures?
3) Last line of abstract needs some development to say how results support the social complexity
hypothesis e.g. …..by indicating that selection for advertising identity at different levels of a
society may contribute to the evolution of a more complex vocal repertoire.
4) Lines 22/23 describe what your findings support but I’m not sure this view was so widely
accepted previously – I think more generally people have thought in terms of selection for social
communication increasing as social complexity increases because more messages have to be
exchanged. I’d leave out “to discriminate among various tiers of the social structure on lines 22 &
23 and instead add a sentence at the end of the paragraph saying: “This could occur in a number
of ways… ..”where you outline this idea to set up your argument?
5) Line 33: Accordingly would be better than As a result here.
6) Line 35 “…the variability of vocal signals would be greatest in cetaceans where…”
7) Line 52/53 Careful of switching from dialect to repertoire – I think the definitions and use of
these two terms could be made and kept clearer throughout.
8) Line 73 I suggest “…interpulse interval and therefore size [30,31, see below], ….
9) Lines 115/116 Rephrase“…number of clicks was measured with both a Euclidian….using
absolute ICI measures as in previous work…”
10) Lines 150/151 – two onlys.
11) Lines 154 – I felt the meat of what you showed got a bit lost in this section and I’d take a key
sentence from the legend of Table 1 and have it in the text here. “Mantell test across all units has a
null hypothesis that repertoire similarity between recordings of the same days (within unit) is the
same as between recordings of different units on different days (between units)… then your very
strong results.
12) Line 188 missing word …also ?differ in their…
13) Line 228/9 could be misleading – change to …units that belong to within-clan units in the
Pacific…
14) Para at 245 – very interesting!
15) Lines 278-280 could be clearer on signals versus cues.
16) Last line of conclusion – as with last sentence of abstract need to do more to spell out how it
supports the social complexity hypothesis

Title: Distinctive modes of variation in sperm whale codas reflect individual identity, social unit
membership, and vocal clan affiliation
Authors: Shane Gero, Hal Whitehead, Luke Rendell
The manuscript aims to verify if the hypothesis of social complexity applies to a large marine
mammal species, Physeter macrocephalus. To this end, the authors describe the structure of
codas issued by the Eastern Caribbean sperm whales and perform discriminant analyzes at the
individual and social unity levels. The five years study is based on 4116 codas attributed to nine
units of 4 to 12 individuals each. This large amount of raw data and the previous knowledge
about the social organization of these units allow the authors to perform several discriminant
analyzes and confirm the hypothesis of social complexity in sperm whales. The manuscript
provide new and exciting understanding on the social structure of the population of sperm
whales from the Eastern Caribbean. The authors demonstrate that the nine units form a single
clan because two coda types are dominant in all units for decades. Their results also reveal that
certain coda types are only characteristic of one or more social units and that it is possible to
discriminate the individuals belonging to the same unit based on the coda types they produce.
The manuscript is well written and analyzes are adequate, using powerful statistical reference
tools. For all these reasons, I recommend the publication of this manuscript in Royal Society
Open Science.
Methodological aspects published in previous articles are always cited in the text. Specific
analyzes for this manuscript are fully described in the main text or in the extensive electronic
supplemental material. The number of analyzes, figures and tables included in these documents
is substantial. Therefore, I suggest the inclusion of a table summarizing all analyzes, each row
informing the purpose of the analysis (or the hypothesis tested) and the corresponding figure or
table (in the main text or in the ESM).

Abstract: The ‘social complexity hypothesis’ suggests that complex social structure is a driver of
diversity in animal communication systems. Sperm whales have a heirarchically-structured
society in which the broadest structures are marked on ocean-basin scales by culturally-
transmitted dialects of acoustic signals known as ‘codas’. We examined variation in coda
repertoires among both individual whales and social units –the basic element of sperm whale
society, using data from 9 Caribbean social units across 6 years. Codas were assigned to
individuals using photo-identification and acoustic size measurement, and we calculated
similarity between repertoires using both continuous and categorical methods. We identified 21
coda types, of which two (‘1+1+3’ and ‘5R1’) made up 65% of the codas recorded, were shared
across all units, and have dominated repertoires in this population for at least 30 years.
Individuals appear to differ in the way they produce ‘5R1’ but not ‘1+1+3’ coda. Units use distinct
combinations of 4-click coda types (12% of coda production), which contribute to making unit
repertoires distinctive. Different patterns of variation between coda types suggest divergent
functions, perhaps representing selection for identity signals at several levels of social structure.
Our results support the social complexity hypothesis in a marine species.

hich we present our results the breadth with which we discuss them. Please find below the details of
each of your comments were addressed in the new manuscript.
introduction is a particularly clear summary of the authors’ collective theorizing about sperm whale
al communication and its relationship to sperm whale sociality. Although it is more general than the
c of the paper, it is succinct and well-written, and lays the groundwork for the Discussion as well as the
hods and Results.
nk you.
authors have put a lot of thought into their analysis based on a large body of previous literature on the
e topic. They have examined different aspects of their data using multiple, sometimes similar,
istical procedures. However, the rationale for the steps they took isn’t explicitly laid out, and is
icularly difficult to follow because critical information is split out in the electronic supplement and
vious papers that used different analysis methods. It would help to have a paragraph at the start of the
ion, maybe with a diagram, that lays out the strategy for the analysis – the breakdown between
gorical and continuous, a summary of the variables were entered into the analyses, the procedures
y used for classifying, ordering, clustering, etc. This paragraph/diagram should help readers gain
fidence in their approach.
iewer 1 and Dr. McComb also pick up on this. We have tried to use both innovative new methods while
ensuring that our assumptions and parameter choices do not affect the analysis. This inevitably leads
t should be a linear narrative our “what we did” to have both branching points and repeats as we retest
differing inputs. We struggled with how to best present all the varied analyses while not losing the
der. Nonetheless, we felt that presenting the results from multiple methods and parameter choices made
case for our results stronger. We have attempted to both our analytical path in text and have included a
figure in the ESM which we hope clarifies our choices and methodological approach.
discussion does not suggest how uncertainties in their methods might affect their conclusions, and this
uld be included. For example, the range of sample periods/samples among units and individuals is
e. Might this have affected their results or blurred the distinctions among some codas by
/individual?
ed on the discovery curves presented in the ESM we felt that at the level of the coda types recorded, we
e sampled both individuals and units well. Our statistical tests strongly suggest that the differences
ween repertoires are likely not the result of sampling. Furthermore, we have tried to account for
erences in sample size with respect to the discrimination results by comparing our results with the
cent correct of randomized data as we describe in the main test and ESM. In addition, we have used
eral different methods to address the same question in terms of distance metrics, ICI measures, and by
g categorical and continuous similarity measures – all which support the same results. One can always
that sampling could have affected the results, but we feel we have addressed this diligently. Lastly, it is
ortant to note that Antunes et al.’s [ref 53 in main text] earlier work indicated that the 5R codas varied
ong individuals, while the 1+1+3 did not, with data from one unit, and this larger dataset across multiple
s confirms these findings. This suggests that under sampling likely would not affect our conclusions. We
e added: “Antunes et al.’s [15] preliminary work indicated that the 5R codas varied among individuals,
le the 1+1+3 did not, using data from one unit, and this larger dataset across multiple units confirms
e findings. This suggests that our conclusions are likely robust to under sampling.” to the section of the
with the discovery curves which discusses sample sizes.
authors say they have provided evidence for vocal complexity matching the social complexity of sperm
les. The discussion (beginning on line 269) talks about the importance of understanding how the
les produce and use layers of complexity. However, the authors do not talk about how their findings
te to complexity in other species. In the absence of detail, it is hard to know whether the complexity of
rm whale codas is really directly comparable to other literature on vocal complexity. I know that this
er is not a review of the social complexity hypothesis, but since they have invoked it, I think some
itional detail is justified. How would their interpretation of the hypothesis differ, for example, from that
euchtenberger et al. (2014), which provides a more traditional terrestrial view of complexity?

social giant otter. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 136(5): 2861-2875.
nks for sharing this really interesting paper of which we were not aware (we have added the citation in
introduction). Leuchtenberger et al. in addition to describing the repertoire of the giant otter in more
ail than previous work also correlate group size with repertoire size among mustelids. Their classical
rpretation of the social complexity hypothesis proposes that species with complex social structure
antified as group size in their analysis) should present a more sophisticated communication system
antified as number of call types in their analysis), “which is necessary to deal with a wider range of social
ractions in different behavioural contexts.”
lace of the perspective that simple diversity of call types indicates complexity (like Leuchtengerger et al)
e we consider complexity in terms of signals delivering a diversity of cues with functionally usable
rmation related to multiple levels of social structure – “which [are] necessary to deal with a wider range
ocial interactions”. We take the hypothesis deeper in demonstrating that not only do sperm whales have
mplex multi-levelled social structure (previously defined by both increasing group size and the modular,
tileveled organization), but that they have the accordingly sophisticated communication (quantified by
h number of call types but also the variation within types), to deal with the specific social interactions at
ous levels of their social structure. We connect the specific structures which create the social complexity
their expected signal diversity. This is not just a correlation between the two, it is a demonstration that
expected signals a sperm whale would need to address the specifics types of social interactions they
encounter do in fact exist.

the main reason for our new methodological approach in using OPTICS rather than k-means clustering.
ICS allows for codas that are outliers or located in sparse areas between dense clusters to be labelled as
e, rather than being forced into clusters. This creates a scenario in which classification of click patterns
ghly conservative (all codas included in a cluster – i.e. a Type – are very similar to each other), and
biguous codas were removed from the categorical analysis as ‘noise’. This is explained in our
tification for the use of OPTICSxi over previously used k-means methods” in the ESM and more briefly in
. We have attempted to clarify these points in both locations and we provide a reference to the
antages of OTPICS over k-means in the ESM.
: Which variants of distance measure (Euclidean, etc.) were tested and how would distance have
cted the multivariate similarity if the codas hadn’t been distinctive in the way they expected? In other
ds, to what degree was robustness with regard to the distance measure supportive of their results?
ur analysis, we used two measures of ICI to quantify the ICIs within codas (absolute timing and
dardized by duration) and two distance metrics to quantify continuous similarity between codas
lidean and Infinity-norm). By demonstrating that the results are robust to changing our methods
port our conclusions by eliminating the possibility that our methodological choices lead to our results.
measures:
we define a coda quantitatively in order to apply the analytical measures of similarity is determined by
oice of the measure. Previous work has demonstrated that using absolute ICI timing over standardized
ng, so including information regarding both the rhythm and tempo of a coda, preserves more useful
rmation (e.g Antunes et al.). As a result, we provide the absolute ICI results in the main text and the
dardized in the ESM.
ance metrics and Similarity:
e we have quantified the codas, we needed a similarity measure between two codas. In the continuous
hod, we are essentially measuring a multivariate distance between two points, and then inverting it to
vide a similarity measure. There are a large number of ways to do this. Euclidean distances are often
n as a default when the different variables are in the same units (as they are in our case), while infinity-
m has been the one chosen in previous work on codas.
ing Measures and Metrics:
he main text, we present the results from the absolute ICIs using a Euclidean distance metric in the
tinuous measure of similarity. In the ESM, we present those results using standardized ICIs and an
nity-norm distance. In reality, we also tested the two other combinations: absolute ICIs with infinity-
m distance and Standardized ICIs with Euclidean distances. We also changed the value for the basal
larity from 1 – 0.001 with no variation in overall patterns. We felt that for publication, we would
plify as much as possible (only reporting two of the four parallel analyses and including only basal
larity of 0.001 – the most fine resolution comparison), while still highlighting that our methods produce
lts which are robust to variation in the choices we made during analysis.
uld Dr. Bowles or the editor feel that there is a need to extend the discussion and definition of these
sures and metrics in the ESM we would be happy to do so, but we do not feel that it is really within the
pe of the paper or that it would improve the comprehension of the reader by diving even deeper into the
hanics of the multivariate statistics used given that all three reviewers already feel the description of
analyses is complex. Furthermore, each of these are discussed at length in both methods and
erimental papers in the past which we reference. Lastly, we hope that the new figure in the ESM (FIG S1)
the changes in the methods section text have clarified this issue.
: The observation that the codas did not change significantly over time is mentioned as an aside.
ever, this invariance is the driving phenomenon behind the degree of individual, unit, etc. specificity
y found in their analysis; so, it would make sense to discuss it earlier in the results section, and maybe
vide a table or figure about change over time in the codas they studied. This is particularly important
n the discussion starting on line 278.
ine 164 (now line 184), we stated that the unit level repertoires do not change significantly across the 6
r study. We provide a table of statistics (Table S7) in the ESM (referenced in main text) to show the
larity between years of the repertoires of units and individualss. Variation in the structure of particular
a types across years within coda types (c.f. Deecke et al 2000 Dialect change in resident killer whales:

dern mechanized whaling did not target sperm whales in the western tropical North Atlantic and thus
have had minimal impact on the social units of females living in the Caribbean; however they were

-271: I would add to the list of properties the following: the capacity to produce vocal signals with
icient stereotypy (not the same as being able to identify them). Their findings suggest that sperm
les must be able to retain an accurate template in memory and to emit sounds using it for very long
ods.

re 2. Something that struck me in this dendrogram: Pinchy was the only F Unit whale that produced a
proportion of 5R1 codas, and yet this is one of the 2 codas uniformly used with high proportion in their
of Dominican social units. Is there any indication that this whale is special? Say whether the same
ern was found in other units.
he other units, there are several animals which produce 5R1 as >10% of their production (see the ESM).
h patterns are interesting. Our current work tries to help understand by looking at possible syntax and
ering of coda types, patterns of type use across social and behavioural contexts, and perhaps most
cific to your observation, vocal dominance – do certain animals consistently lead vocal exchanges or
duce an unexpected proportion of codas? Pinchy has been a mother for the majority of our study, with a
nile male leaving the unit when she gave birth to her next son. She has also been a primary babysitter
another female in her unit.

r Dr. McComb,
ally appreciate your enthusiasm for the manuscript and your positive feedback. We hope that you feel
have addressed all of your specific comments and improved the manuscript to a level that you would
mmend publication.
is a very interesting paper, which uses an impressively extensive dataset to tackle questions about how
al signals in sperm whales advertise successive levels of social affiliation – specifically clan and social
membership as well as individual identity. This sort of study is rarely possible in large mammals and by
g their unique dataset and powerful analysis methods the authors have been able to break new ground
e and their findings should be of wide interest.
nk you.
1) I think the title could be usefully changed to “Distinctive modes of variation in sperm whale codas
reflect social unit membership and vocal clan affiliation as well as individual identity”. This would
stress more what is new/unique about the paper.
It is true that the most distinctive new results are at the unit level, but the results at the other levels
are important too, and the comparison between them is arguably most significant. Thus we have
provided a shorter, clearer variant of our original title that treats individual, unit and clan variation
as similarly significant by listing them in the order of the social hierarchy.
2) Line 4 “broadest structures” is rather unclear here – change to affiliative structures?
We have reworded as “Sperm whales have a hierarchically-structured society in which the largest
affiliative structures, the vocal clans, are marked on ocean-basin scales by culturally-transmitted
dialects of acoustic signals known as ‘codas’.” We feel this highlights both your point about
affliation and ours about clans being the largest/highest structure in their society.
3) Last line of abstract needs some development to say how results support the social complexity
hypothesis e.g. …..by indicating that selection for advertising identity at different levels of a society
may contribute to the evolution of a more complex vocal repertoire.
We have flipped the last two lines in the abstract and reworded slightly though out to make this
point, while still keeping it under 200 words.
4) Lines 22/23 describe what your findings support but I’m not sure this view was so widely accepted
previously – I think more generally people have thought in terms of selection for social
communication increasing as social complexity increases because more messages have to be
exchanged. I’d leave out “to discriminate among various tiers of the social structure on lines 22 &
23 and instead add a sentence at the end of the paragraph saying: “This could occur in a number of
ways… ..”where you outline this idea to set up your argument?
We have reworded the first paragraph to fit better with the classical interpretation of the
hypothesis, but note that in some respects we have taken testing this hypothesis to a deeper level
by highlighting the implicit assumption underlying the hypothesis; that there must be functional
usage of these additional “messages”. We connect the specific structures which create the social
complexity with their expected signal diversity. We now make this point in the discussion.
5) Line 33: Accordingly would be better than As a result here.
Changed
6) Line 35 “…the variability of vocal signals would be greatest in cetaceans where…”\
We have added “in cetaceans”.
7) Line 52/53 Careful of switching from dialect to repertoire – I think the definitions and use of these
two terms could be made and kept clearer throughout.
We ascribe to the distinction of a dialect put forward by Conner (1982 Dialects versus geographic
variation in mammalian vocalizations. Anim. Behav. 30, 297–298) for mammals based on
Nottenbohm (1969 The song of the chingolo, Zonotrichia capensis, in Argentina: description and
evaluation of a system of dialects. Condor, 71, 299-315.). Dialects refer to distinctions between
communities which are overlapping or neighbouring and have the potential to interbreed. We use
“repertoire” simply as the collection of calls made by a unit or individual. In this case, the
geographic variation of repertoires in the Atlantic and the multiple sympatric dialects among clans
in the Pacific. We only use the term dialect in the introduction in this paragraph and once in the
discussion to state we have not found evidence of sympatric dialects in the Caribbean; throughout
the rest of the manuscript we use the term repertoire. We did reword one sentence here to clarify
this.
8) Line 73 I suggest “…interpulse interval and therefore size [30,31, see below], ….
Changed to fit your suggestion
9) Lines 115/116 Rephrase“…number of clicks was measured with both a Euclidian….using absolute ICI
measures as in previous work…”
Reworded
10) Lines 150/151 – two onlys.
Fixed
11) Lines 154 – I felt the meat of what you showed got a bit lost in this section and I’d take a key
sentence from the legend of Table 1 and have it in the text here. “Mantell test across all units has a
null hypothesis that repertoire similarity between recordings of the same days (within unit) is the
same as between recordings of different units on different days (between units)… then your very
strong results.
We have added the details of the Mantel tests here and in the individuals’ results and presented the
test statistics and p-values in the text.
12) Line 188 missing word …also ?differ in their…
Corrected
13) Line 228/9 could be misleading – change to …units that belong to within-clan units in the Pacific…
We are very sorry, but we are not sure what you’d would like changed here. This sentence points
out that the repertoire similarity between units in the Caribbean is higher than that of unit
repertoires for members of the same vocal clan in the Pacific; and therefore that all these Caribbean
units belong to a single clan. We have reworded in an attempt to clarify.
14) Para at 245 – very interesting!
We think so too! Glad we are not the only ones!
15) Lines 278-280 could be clearer on signals versus cues.
We have added “The existence of cues does not imply that selection has acted on those cues to produce
unambiguous, recognizable identity signals” to clarify.
16) Last line of conclusion – as with last sentence of abstract need to do more to spell out how it
supports the social complexity hypothesis
We've added as suggested
17) [Minor - note communication misspelled in keywords]
Corrected
