Referee report on the RSOS manuscript
The transiting dust clumps in the evolved disk of the Sunlike UXOr RZ Psc
label_version_2
RSOS-160652
The manuscript focusses on a very interesting and rare object, RZ Psc. The central question of the
study is whether a careful analysis of new long-term optical photometric observations would
allow to decide between two competing hypotheses on the physical reason of the eclipses:
hydrodynamical turbulence or the passage of asteroidal fragments. The data do not allow to give
definite answer, nevertheless the detailed discussions of many aspects of occultations can be
considered as a valuable contribution to the literature of this object.
I like the solid, systematic approach of the authors, accept their new results (mainly on the
possible periods of the eclipses) and recommend the paper for publication with very few minor
recommendations.
Comments:
[1] Abstract Sentence 1. Please be a bit more precise: if the occultation is done by optically thick
dust clumps then the color changes would not follow the extinction curve. Do you mean clumps
which are optically thick at their centres and less opaque outside?
[2] General: please check the literature: I believe the abbreviation 'UXor' is more commonly used
than the form 'UXOr' adopted in this paper.
[3] Sect. 2 Par 3. The "de Wit et al. picture assumes planetesimals that are continually being
destroyed. These collisions generate the large collective surface area of small dust that emits
strongly in the mid-IR." The authors may want to check mid-infrared monitoring data (e.g. the
WISE, NeoWISE and reactivated WISE all-sky surveys, altogether 6 epochs over some 6 years) to
look for variability of the mid-IR emission. If it is related to collisions, the emission should go up
and down depending on the time lasted since the last big collision.
[4] Sect. 3, Par 1. I do not see necessary to list all those data sets which were finally not used.
[5] Fig. 1 Caption. Please refer to the main text on how were fluxes calculated from magnitudes.
[6] Page 5, top. Please explain which filter, which photometric band was used by the listed
telescopes.
[7] Fig. 3. Is there any interpretation for the negative peaks? Are they just noise (but below -3 sig)?
[8] Page 11, top. Please give a reference for the statement "pressure effects in a hydrodynamic
turbulence scenario might also disperse a clump"
[9] Eq 4.2. Somehow my feeling is that in the second integral the distance unit is R* (as stated also
in the text). But then why not to use it in the first integral, why do we integrate from -R* to +R*,
and not from -1 to +1?
[10] Sect. 5, Sentence 2. "These clumps can be optically thick,". Would be worth to compute how
much dust is needed for optical thickness, with some assumption on the geometry. If we assume
3
some realistic lifetime of dust particles at this distance from the star, can we get a realistic number
for the destroyed planetesimals per year, assuming typical comet mass?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This paper is a very thorough and considerate analysis of lightcurves for the anomalous variable
star RZ Psc, for a long time considered to be an eclipsing UXOr variable. Two scenarios are
plausible for the day-long dimmings in this star, inhomegenities in a gas-rich disk, or a kind of
asteroid belt in a debris disk. While the results of this paper remain inconclusive with regards to
these two scenarios, the paper definitely provides new insights and constraints on the occulting
bodies, based on an unprecedented decade-long dataset. Among others, the paper presents for
the first time (?) weak evidence for a periodicity. In the final chapters, the paper also attempts a
unifying explanation for various types of young stars affected by disk eclipses and puts RZ Psc in
the context of the general picture of disk evolution, which adds relevance to the paper.
The paper is well written and illustrated, and convincly argued throughout. I absolutely
recommend publication. All comments that I had while reading the paper are of cosmetic nature,
mostly minor clarifications. I list these comments in detail below. Because these comments do not
substantially affect the paper, I do not insist on seeing it again after the revision.
1. Introduction, 1st paragraph: 'most has accreted and the remainder been lost to space' - I would
prefer to state this more cautiously. We know that accretion and photoevaporation play a role
(among other processes), but we do not know their relative important, so, 'most' is to me a reach.
2. Introduction, 4th paragraph: Since the entire introduction is discussing young stars with some
type of disk, I find it slightly misleading to quote the paper on Tabby's star (reference 20), which
may or may not have any circumstellar matter.
4
3. Sect. 2: I suggest to make it clear from the outset that the eclipses in RZ Psc could be either an
asteroid belt or hydrodynamical changes in a gas-rich transition disk. This section seems to
express a strong preference the former scenario (as does the abstract). Later in the paper it
becomes clear that both scenarios are still plausible, which causes a little confusion in the overall
argument of the paper.
4. Sect. 3, 1st paragraph: I think when using the WASP archive, it is worth citing Butters et al.
2010.
5. Sect. 4a, i, 2nd paragraph: Since 'swamped' is not a technical term, it might be useful to explain
precisely what is meant here.
6. Sect. 4a, ii, 5th paragraph: 'distributed between 1 and 4 days' -- I suggest to add 'comparable to
the observed duration of the events (if that is indeed the case).
7. Figure 3: the histogram in the top panel needs labels on the y-axis. The DACF plots would
benefit from making the squares larger.
8. Sect. 4a, ii: The simulations illustrated in Fig. 4 are quite nice. I have the impression the authors
understate the evidence for a ~65d period slightly, but that's not for me to decide. I'm confused
though about the statement in the last paragraph 'an event occurs about once every 13 days' -
how is that possible with a periodicity of 65 days? (And could the tentative 10 day period be the
rotation period of the star?)
(At the end of Sect. 4a, iii, the reader is for the first time again reminded that the asteroid belt
scenario is not the only game in town, which is mildly confusing - see my point 3.)
8. Sect. 4b, i: Some of the equations in the model descriptions probably warrant a bit more
commentary, for example, the double integral in equ 4.2 and the scaling factors in equ 4.6 and 4.7.
9. Sect. 4b, ii, 1st paragraph: It might be worth adding that this application only makes sense
because in most cases one night of data only covers ingress OR egress, not both.
10. Figure 6: It seems to me that the line described in the text as 'brown' is in fact 'green'.
11. Penultimate paragraph in Sect 4b: 'distribution in section (c)' - I assume this is 5c?
(At the end of Sect 4 the reader hears again about the potential of a significant gas reservoir -
again it might have been useful to introduce this earlier, see comment 3.)
12. Very beginning of Sect 5: 'star-sized clumps of dust' - Here I was confused, because the
curtain-model was operating under the assumption that the clumps are much larger than the star,
at least in y-direction, or not?
13. Sect. 5a, 2rd paragraph: I was wondering if it is possible to state more firmly how little
extinction is seen along the line of sight. The authors quote constraints between 0 and a few
percent. With known spectral type and colour, can this be done more precisely?
14. Sect. 5b: Again I would appreciate a little more commentary on equation 5.2, for readers who
do not immediately see where the scaling law is coming from.
15. Figure 7: I do not understand why the UXOrs are assumed to have occulting bodies near 1
AU.
16. Sect. 5d, 1st paragraph: 'includes many Sun like stars' - I suggest saying 'young Sun like stars'
here, to be clear.
5
17. Figure 8: The authors make a comment on possible variability between the AKARI and WISE
datapoint. But the WISE archive also provides information on variability. There may also be
NEOWISE data on this star. I mention this because variability in the mid-infrared could be an
additional clue on the nature of the dimmings.
18. Again Figure 8: Looking at this figure, the distinction between debris and transition disks
seems dubious to me. On what basis is HD113766A classified as debris disk? One aspect here is
that these are stars with very different spectral types and therefore very different irradiation of
the disk. To make the comparison fairer, it might be wise to scale the SEDs with the flux at 1mu.
That might show that the two potential debris disks have lower disk luminosities than GM Aur.
Just as a sidenote, classical accretion disks show a wide range of SED properties, and particularly
transition disks are very diverse. The SED of RZ Psc reminds me of the depleted transition disks
where dust settling and clearing have both occured (see for example the samples in Rodgers-Lee
et al. 2014). I do agree that RZ Psc might be an interesting case between late primordial disks and
debris disks.
19. Figure 9: I absolutely appreciate the cartoon figure to illustrate the origins of disk eclipses. The
only issue I have is the depiction of the disk in low-mass and Sun-like stars. My understanding is
that even in these objects the inner rim of the disk is not smooth, but has a wall-like feature (just
closer to the star, in comparison with Herbig Ae/Be stars), maybe even more pronounced in
transition disks (see for example the PPVI review by Espaillat). It might be good to stress that the
depiction is very simplified. (Another point one might raise: The cartoon seems to imply that the
magnetic axis is always inclined with respect to the rotational axis.)

The transiting dust clumps in the evolved disk
of the Sunlike UXOr RZ Psc
label_version_4
RSOS-160652
The manuscript focusses on a very interesting and rare object, RZ Psc. The
central question of the study is whether a careful analysis of new long-term
optical photometric observations would allow to decide between two competing
hypotheses on the physical reason of the eclipses: hydrodynamical turbulence or
the passage of asteroidal fragments. The data do not allow to give definite
answer, nevertheless the detailed discussions of many aspects of occultations
can be considered as a valuable contribution to the literature of this object.
I like the solid, systematic approach of the authors, accept their new results
(mainly on the possible periods of the eclipses) and recommend the paper for
publication with very few minor recommendations.
Comments:
[1] Abstract Sentence 1. Please be a bit more precise: if the occultation is done by
optically thick dust clumps then the color changes would not follow the extinction
curve. Do you mean clumps which are optically thick at their centres and less opaque
outside?
Indeed we do, though the 200 word limit means adding such details would mean removing
details about the results. Whether the clumps are optically thick or not is relatively
unimportant for the abstract, so we have instead side-stepped and reworded the sentence
to "...partially or wholly dimmed...", since the large depth of the dimming events is the
main point here.
[2] General: please check the literature: I believe the abbpreviation 'UXor' is more
commonly used than the form 'UXOr' adopted in this paper.
Yes (in particular Herbst & Shevchenko 1999), thank you. Changed throughout.
[3] Sect. 2 Par 3. The "de Wit et al. picture assumes planetesimals that are
continually being destroyed. These collisions generate the large collective
want to check mid-infrared monitoring data (e.g. the WISE, NeoWISE and
reactivated WISE all-sky surveys, altogether 6 epochs over some 6 years) to
look for variability of the mid-IR emission. If it is related to collisions,
the emission should go up and down depending on the time lasted since the last
big collision.
There is indeed WISE variability, and even without the epoch data disagreement between
WISE and a previous AKARI 18um non-detection suggests variability. This variation was in
fact used to justify VISIR observations and the intention was to that this would be a
separate study. However, we obtained the VISIR spectrum and Q photometry since submitting
the manuscript, so have included it and the WISE epoch photometry here. Most of this has
been incorporated into a revised S3, now split into optical and IR photometry. Since we
conclude that the IR emission is not dominated by the same dust that causes the dimming
events, there is no need for the two to be correlated (though the WISE data are not at
high enough cadence to test this).
[4] Sect. 3, Par 1. I do not see necessary to list all those data sets which
were finally not used.
This is included in case others want the data, as some of it had to be digitised
by hand and using character recognition software so we think it could at least save
others the same effort. The other referee was not concerned, so we have shortened the
description a little but retained the information.
[5] Fig. 1 Caption. Please refer to the main text on how were fluxes calculated from magnitudes.
Note added.
[6] Page 5, top. Please explain which filter, which photometric band was used by the listed telescopes.
Done, and references added.
[7] Fig. 3. Is there any interpretation for the negative peaks? Are they just noise (but below -3 sig)?
Largely these arise because the DACF distribution is non-Gaussian, though there are
probably a few cases where there are anti-correlated data. The squares provided no real
information so we have removed them.
[8] Page 11, top. Please give a reference for the statement "pressure effects
in a hydrodynamic turbulence scenario might also disperse a clump"
There was no reference for this, just the fact that the sound crossing time for a
star-sized clump at 1au is less than the orbital period, so a clump caused by pressure
related effects (i.e. turbulence) could also be dispersed quickly since pressure
overdensities could re-equilibrate (or at least change). We have made this argument
clearer in the text.
[9] Eq 4.2. Somehow my feeling is that in the second integral the distance unit is R* (as
stated also in the text). But then why not to use it in the first integral, why do we
integrate from -R* to +R*, and not from -1 to +1?
Indeed, the limits in the second integral should be sqrt(R_*^2 - x^2). So the origin of
equation 4.2 is clear, we used units of R_*.
[10] Sect. 5, Sentence 2. "These clumps can be optically thick,". Would be worth to
compute how much dust is needed for optical thickness, with some assumption on the
geometry. If we assume some realistic lifetime of dust particles at this distance from
the star, can we get a realistic number for the destroyed planetesimals per year,
assuming typical comet mass?
Given the conclusion that most of the IR excess is not related to the clumps, such a
expected disk lifetime at this brightness (if a debris disk) and the associated
planetesimal destruction rate doesn't inform the interpretation of the light curve, so we
have not tried to make such a calculation. The best estimate of the destruction rate in
terms of what can be said given the light curve is the number of ~30 year from the
dimming events discussed in section 4ii.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper is a very thorough and considerate analysis
of lightcurves for the anomalous variable star RZ Psc,
for a long time considered to be an eclipsing UXOr
variable. Two scenarios are plausible for the day-long
dimmings in this star, inhomegenities in a gas-rich disk,
or a kind of asteroid belt in a debris disk. While the
results of this paper remain inconclusive with regards
to these two scenarios, the paper definitely provides
new insights and constraints on the occulting bodies,
based on an unprecedented decade-long dataset. Among
others, the paper presents for the first time (?) weak
evidence for a periodicity. In the final chapters, the
paper also attempts a unifying explanation for various
types of young stars affected by disk eclipses and puts
RZ Psc in the context of the general picture of disk
evolution, which adds relevance to the paper.
The paper is well written and illustrated, and convincly
argued throughout. I absolutely recommend publication.
All comments that I had while reading the paper are of
cosmetic nature, mostly minor clarifications. I list these
comments in detail below. Because these comments do not
substantially affect the paper, I do not insist on seeing
it again after the revision.
1. Introduction, 1st paragraph: 'most has accreted and the
remainder been lost to space' - I would prefer to state this
more cautiously. We know that accretion and photoevaporation
play a role (among other processes), but we do not know their
relative important, so, 'most' is to me a reach.
Fair enough, modified in a more cautious way.
2. Introduction, 4th paragraph: Since the entire introduction
is discussing young stars with some type of disk, I find it
slightly misleading to quote the paper on Tabby's star (reference
20), which may or may not have any circumstellar matter.
This paper was being noted as one of the side-effects from transit surveys. Nevertheless,
this paper will not lack citations so we have removed it.
3. Sect. 2: I suggest to make it clear from the outset
that the eclipses in RZ Psc could be either an asteroid belt
or hydrodynamical changes in a gas-rich transition disk. This
section seems to express a strong preference the former scenario
(as does the abstract). Later in the paper it becomes clear
that both scenarios are still plausible, which causes a little
Indeed, this probably reflects the way in which this project was approached. We have
tried to provide a more balanced picture, and introduced the disk status as a major
question from the outset. Providing a more balanced view has resulted in minor changes
throughout.
4. Sect. 3, 1st paragraph: I think when using the WASP archive,
it is worth citing Butters et al. 2010.
Indeed, done.
5. Sect. 4a, i, 2nd paragraph: Since 'swamped' is not a technical
term, it might be useful to explain precisely what is meant here.
This was the aim of the words following swamped, we have reworded it.
6. Sect. 4a, ii, 5th paragraph: 'distributed between 1 and 4 days'
-- I suggest to add 'comparable to the observed duration of the
events (if that is indeed the case).
Yes, done.
7. Figure 3: the histogram in the top panel needs labels on the y-axis.
The DACF plots would benefit from making the squares larger.
We added the y-axis labels. We removed the squares as they are not particularly useful
(e.g the DACF distributions are non-Gaussian).
8. Sect. 4a, ii: The simulations illustrated in Fig. 4 are quite nice.
I have the impression the authors understate the evidence for a ~65d
period slightly, but that's not for me to decide. I'm confused though
about the statement in the last paragraph 'an event occurs about once
every 13 days' - how is that possible with a periodicity of 65 days?
(And could the tentative 10 day period be the rotation period of the star?)
Indeed, we are likely being conservative on the period. The 13d is possible because more
than one set of repeating events can be going on at a time. We have clarified this in the
text. The 10d peak is probably not rotation, as the event finding should not be finding
sinusoidal (or similar) signals in the data. We have not seen strong evidence for a
rotation signature.
(At the end of Sect. 4a, iii, the reader is for the first time
again reminded that the asteroid belt scenario is not the only
game in town, which is mildly confusing - see my point 3.)
See above.
8. Sect. 4b, i: Some of the equations in the model descriptions
probably warrant a bit more commentary, for example, the double
integral in equ 4.2 and the scaling factors in equ 4.6 and 4.7.
We have added a sentence on the meaning of the integrals. The scaling factors arise from
the choice of units du/dt and df/dt. We have said explicitly that when these units are
used the numbers can be plugged into equations 4.6 and 4.7.
9. Sect. 4b, ii, 1st paragraph: It might be worth adding that
this application only makes sense because in most cases one night
of data only covers ingress OR egress, not both.
Yes, done.
as 'brown' is in fact 'green'.
Thank you. The first author is partially colour blind, and this was a guess not checked
with/by co-authors...
11. Penultimate paragraph in Sect 4b: 'distribution in section (c)'
- I assume this is 5c?
Yes, this appears to be a limitation of the RSOS style. This has been noted in the hope
that it will be fixed during publication.
(At the end of Sect 4 the reader hears again about the potential
of a significant gas reservoir - again it might have been useful
to introduce this earlier, see comment 3.)
See above.
12. Very beginning of Sect 5: 'star-sized clumps of dust' - Here I
was confused, because the curtain-model was operating under the
assumption that the clumps are much larger than the star, at least
in y-direction, or not?
This is indeed the assumption of the model, and there is a note that hints that this is
not always the case after equation 4.5. However, we have made this point more explicit,,
noting that a variety of clump sizes probably exists where the curtain model is
introduced. For our purposes here (i.e. mainly the conversion from Fig 7 to Fig 8, which
includes some very deep events where the clumps must be close to star sized or larger) we
consider the model sufficient.
13. Sect. 5a, 2rd paragraph: I was wondering if it is possible to
state more firmly how little extinction is seen along the line of
sight. The authors quote constraints between 0 and a few percent.
With known spectral type and colour, can this be done more precisely?
Better limits on extinction would be difficult, since it requires both a precise
knowledge of the expected stellar spectrum and very precise photometry. Getting either of
these, at better than the percent level is hard. In particular 1% photometry is about the
limit for quiet stars, so doing better for one that varies so much would be difficult.
14. Sect. 5b: Again I would appreciate a little more commentary on
equation 5.2, for readers who do not immediately see where the scaling
law is coming from.
We have added a sentence noting that it comes from solving the one that precedes it in
the text, and clarified the units of the terms.
15. Figure 7: I do not understand why the UXOrs are assumed to have
occulting bodies near 1 AU.
This was based on the inner edge of a "typical" Herbig Ae/Be (commonly said in the
literature to be ~0.5-1au) and the idea of Dullemond+03 that the UXors are self-shadowed
disks where the occulting material is at the inner disk edge. Looking deeper into this,
sizes measured for inner disks in the near-IR cover a wider range so we have updated the
figure and associated text to reflect this.
16. Sect. 5d, 1st paragraph: 'includes many Sun like stars' - I suggest
saying 'young Sun like stars' here, to be clear.
Done.
17. Figure 8: The authors make a comment on possible variability between
on variability. There may also be NEOWISE data on this star. I mention
this because variability in the mid-infrared could be an additional
clue on the nature of the dimmings.
Indeed, see response to similar comment from the first referee above. The result is a new
section on mid-IR data, including some new VISIR observations.
18. Again Figure 8: Looking at this figure, the distinction between
debris and transition disks seems dubious to me. On what basis is
HD113766A classified as debris disk? One aspect here is that these
are stars with very different spectral types and therefore very different
irradiation of the disk. To make the comparison fairer, it might be
wise to scale the SEDs with the flux at 1mu. That might show that
the two potential debris disks have lower disk luminosities than GM Aur.
Just as a sidenote, classical accretion disks show a wide range of SED
properties, and particularly transition disks are very diverse. The SED
of RZ Psc reminds me of the depleted transition disks where dust settling
and clearing have both occured (see for example the samples in Rodgers-Lee
et al. 2014). I do agree that RZ Psc might be an interesting case
between late primordial disks and debris disks.
The main distinction has been based on age, but also includes considerations such as
mid-IR gas signatures and dust compositions derived from mid-IR spectra. Indeed
HD113766's SED may be ambiguous, and this was in fact noted in a previous paper
(Kennedy+2014), and is now noted here.
Indeed GM Aur is a later type star at K5, and HD 113766 is ~F4, so the range of
fractional luminosities (L_IR/Lstar) is larger than might be surmised from Fig 8, though
in fact HD113766 is a few percent, which is still very large and only a factor of a few
different to HD166191 and RZ Psc. We have discussed these differences in the text rather
than modify the plot because it would be hard to shift the SEDs in a way that reflects
these differences.
19. Figure 9: I absolutely appreciate the cartoon figure to illustrate
the origins of disk eclipses. The only issue I have is the depiction
of the disk in low-mass and Sun-like stars. My understanding is that
even in these objects the inner rim of the disk is not smooth, but
has a wall-like feature (just closer to the star, in comparison with
Herbig Ae/Be stars), maybe even more pronounced in transition disks
(see for example the PPVI review by Espaillat). It might be good to
stress that the depiction is very simplified. (Another point one might
raise: The cartoon seems to imply that the magnetic axis is always
inclined with respect to the rotational axis.)
We have updated the figure slightly to include a clearer inner edge for the low mass and
Sun-like stars, as well as added some text emphasising that Fig 9 is indeed simplified,
and that the stellar magnetic field need not be tilted.
Additional changes:
S4a: the shear rate should have been R dOmega/DR, not dVphi/dR. The difference is a
factor 3 so makes no difference to our conclusions.
