This paper describes an interesting pre-supporting system, called Steel Tube Slab (STS), that can
be useful especially in case of large span underground excavation close to ground surface. Based
on the numerical simulation and in situ monitoring, STS structure seems to be very effective and
dependable measure in controlling and reducing the surface settlement and the existing
surrounding buildings. Moreover, an interesting section of the paper is related to the influence of
the excavation step length on the horizontal displacements at the tunnel face and on the ground
settlement. I think that It’s very useful for the application and promotion of STS technique.
However, In order to improve the level of this manuscript better, some revisions need to be done,
such as the following.
1. “I suggest the Authors highlighting/mentioning the main findings obtained at the end of the

Brief summary
STS construction method is first to be proposed, and according to the numerical calculation and
the field monitoring, the authors obtain that STS structure can reduce and control settlements and
reduce unpleasant effects on existing buildings in the neighborhoods of the excavation site. It is a
4
good paper for the later engineering application, but I have some concerns/doubts about the
manuscript and suggest the author make several minor versions.
Comments and Questions
1) Fig. 3 (left) is similar to Fig. 6 (f). on the other hand, Fig. 3 (right) is identical to Fig. 7. Please
check that.
2) Table 2. How to get submitted E?
3) As for the numerical model, the relationship between soil and structure is a complex question,
how did the Authors consider?
4) In section 5.3, there should have the construction history depending on the staged
construction. The construction history will justify the heave, which is observed in Fig. 24.
5) From the framework of this paper, it seems that the fourth chapter is not strictly necessary, I
suggest the author delete the part to increase the continuity of this paper. If it is possible, the
author can make some the initial parameter analysis in this chapter using the numerical software.
Typo and grammatical
1) In suit? It should be “in situ”, for example Page 2 Row 11, please check the text.
2) “…a new technique for …. are presented…” should be “…a new technique for … is
presented” in the Page 5, Row 7.
3) “it was decided … , is used to design and construct the station” I think is better to change with
“it was decided to use … for the design and the construction of the station ” in the Page 5, Rows
47-48
4) The cross-references to Fig. 9a,b,c,d,e are not correct. I think these references are related to Fig.
6 in the Page 7.
5) “he overburden pressure” should be “the overburden pressure” in the Page 8, Row 3.
6) Page 16, Row 29: of STS structure has s high stiffness? Maybe it should be “a”.
7) “flange flanges” in the Page 23 Row 3?

Appendix A
Dear Editors and Reviewers
Thanks for your careful review and your comments with regard to my manuscript: “A Case Study on
the Application of the Steel Tube Slab Structure in Construction of a Subway Station” (Manuscript ID:
label_version_3
RSOS-181035).
The comments are beneficial for me to revise and improve the manuscript. The manuscript has been
revised according to the comments. The responds to the reviewers are as follows:
Reviewer1#
This paper describes an interesting pre-supporting system, called Steel Tube Slab (STS), that can be
useful especially in case of large span underground excavation close to ground surface. Based on the
numerical simulation and in situ monitoring, STS structure seems to be very effective and
dependable measure in controlling and reducing the surface settlement and the existing surrounding
buildings. Moreover, an interesting section of the paper is related to the influence of the excavation
step length on the horizontal displacements at the tunnel face and on the ground settlement. I think
that It’s very useful for the application and promotion of STS technique. However, In order to
improve the level of this manuscript better, some revisions need to be done, such as the following.
1. “I suggest the Authors highlighting/mentioning the main findings obtained at the end of the
introduction section. “Several key parameters in the design …” is too generic.”
Answer: Several key parameters have been produced in the revised manuscript in detail. They are as
follows: The effect excavation process on ground settlement, deformation of STS structure and
bridge pile are studied, moreover the key parameter such as welding of flanges and spacing of
temporary steel supports are investigated using numerical simulations. Moreover, the other parts of
the introduction have been perfected.
2. The problem studied by the Authors is a very complex soil-structure interaction problem, and I
have appreciated the workflow of the paper, nevertheless I think that the soil conditions at the site
are in general poorly described. So, if it is possible I recommend providing 1 Figure.
Answer: The soil profile has added, Figure6. And depth of the water level is from 5.2m to 14.9m in
the construction area.
Figure 6 geological profile of the soil
3. Section 5.2. I clearly understand the complexity of such a numerical model, however why did the
Authors select the Mohr-Coulomb model? It can be considered sufficient for this case-study?
Answer: Firstly, the relative parameters of Mohr-Coulomb model are more easily obtained.
Meanwhile, it is a common phenomenon that M-C model is used to calculate the complex
construction sequences of underground space, and has obtained great application results.
4. Fig. 20 - Why are used 0.7 m long element in simplified model of STS structure.
Answer: The connection of adjacent steel tubes is shown in below the Fig.1, from the figure,
we can see the distance between the top flange and bottom flange is 0.7m, and the
diameter of the steel tube is 0.9m. Considering the construction security, in the process of
equivalent calculation, the thickness of the simplified model of STS structure is used 0.7m,
which is smaller than actual thickness In order to acquire the conservative computing data.
Subsequently when the data is used to instruct the construction, they can ensure the
construction security better.
Fig. 1 Connection of adjacent steel tubes
5. Fig.24. the numerical solutions presented in Fig. 24 are direct predictions or the result of a back-
analysis.
Answer: Firstly, Comparison of surface settlement between in-suit monitoring and numerical
simulations is investigated to verify the rationality of parameters selection, subsequently based on
the numerical model, the effect excavation process on ground settlement, deformation of STS
structure and bridge pile are studied, moreover the key parameter such as welding of flanges and
the step length are studied.
6. Page 2, Line 12. “in-suit” should be “in-situ…”. This error is repeated several times in all the paper;
Answer: It has been revised in the manuscript.
7. Page 5, Line 54. “statin” should be “station”;
Answer: It has been revised in the manuscript.
8. Page 8, Line 15. Please check the value of 0.022mm, I think it is not correct. Probably should be 16
mm.
Answer: It has been revised in the manuscript.
9. Page 15, Lines 31-32. “It indicate that … were validity” I think it should be better to change with “It
indicates that … were valid”;
Answer: It has been revised in the manuscript.
10. Page 16, Line 29. “of STS structure has s high stiffness” should be “of STS structure has a high
stiffness”;
Answer: It has been revised in the manuscript.
Reviewer2#
1. The title is too broad, a new title “Study on the effect of combining the new supporting structure
with PBA method for a large span subway underground station” is be suggested.
Answer: The title has been revised, “Study on surface settlement and structural deformation for
large span subway station using a new pre-supporting system”.
2. The relative literatures can be added in the introduction.
Answer: The relative literatures have been perfected in the revised manuscript.
3. Some spelling and grammatical errors need to be modified, such as page2 “in-suit”, page5 “statin”,
etc. Check all the paper.
Answer: they have been revised in the manuscript.
4. Page 11: Usually the Puason coefficient is indicated by "<U+03BD>".
Answer: It has been revised in the manuscript.
5. In Fig.17, it is not clear what does the colored part represent.
Answer: It has been revised in the manuscript.

STS construction method is first to be proposed, and according to the numerical calculation and the
field monitoring, the authors obtain that STS structure can reduce and control settlements and
reduce unpleasant effects on existing buildings in the neighborhoods of the excavation site. It is a
good paper for the later engineering application, but I have some concerns/doubts about the
manuscript and suggest the author make several minor versions.
Comments and Questions
1) Fig. 3 (left) is similar to Fig. 6 (f). on the other hand, Fig. 3 (right) is identical to Fig. 7. Please
check that.
Answer: Yes, indeed, Fig. 3 (left) is similar to Fig.6 (f) and, Fig.3 (right) is identical to Fig. 7. Fig. 3 is
used to introduce the proposed support system, Steel Tube Slab method. The engineering
application is introduced in the Fig. 6 (f) and Fig. 7. In a word, they have been revised in the
manuscript.
2) Table 2. How to get submitted E?
Answer: As for the elastic modulus E, top longitudinal beam, bottom longitudinal beam and
cylindrical steel column are all composed of steel and concrete, so they are specified by the
equation:
EA <U+F03D> Es As <U+F02B> Ec Ac
EA <U+F03D> Es As <U+F02B> Ec Ac
where, E- the equivalent elastic modulus; A- the total cross area; Es, Ec - elastic modulus of
steel and concrete, respectively; As, Ac – cross area of steel and concrete, respectively.
3) As for the numerical model, the relationship between soil and structure is a complex question, how
did the Authors consider?
Answer: The interface elements are used to simulate the interaction between soil and structure,
and the interface elements are comprised of a series of the triangular elements contained three
nodes, as is shown in Figure 1. The normal and shear constitutive equation of interfaces
elements are as follows:
Fn<U+F028>
t <U+F02B><U+F044>t <U+F029>
<U+F03D> k n <U+F06D>n A <U+F02B> <U+F073> n A
Fsi<U+F028>
t <U+F02B><U+F044>t <U+F029>
<U+F03D> Fsi <U+F028> <U+F029> <U+F02B> ks <U+F044><U+F06D>si <U+F028>
t <U+F02B> 0.5 <U+F044>t <U+F029>
A <U+F02B> <U+F073> si A
t
where, Fn(t+<U+0394>t) is the normal at time (t+<U+0394>t); Fsi(t+<U+0394>t) is the shear force vector at time (t+<U+0394>t); µn
is the absolute normal penetration of the interface node into the target face; µsi is the
incremental relative shear displacement vector; sn is the additional normal stress added due to
interface stress initialization; ssi is the additional shear stress added due to interface stress
initialization; ks is shear stiffness, kn is normal stiffness, and A is representative area
associated with the interface node.

The absolute normal penetration of interface surfaces and contact nodes and shear relative
velocity are calculated in every step. Subsequently, they are substitute into the constitutive
equations of interface elements to obtain normal stress vector and shear stress vector.
4) In section 5.3, there should have the construction history depending on the staged construction.
The construction history will justify the heave, which is observed in Fig. 24.
Answer: The blue points represent the actual settlement of the construction history in the figure,
but the figure has been replaced in order to improve the quality of the manuscript.
5) From the framework of this paper, it seems that the fourth chapter is not strictly necessary, I
suggest the author delete the part to increase the continuity of this paper. If it is possible, the author
can make some the initial parameter analysis in this chapter using the numerical software.
Answer: The manuscript has been revised according to the comments, and the framework of the
manuscript has been adjusted.
Typo and grammatical
1) In suit? It should be “in situ”, for example Page 2 Row 11, please check the text.
Answer: It has been revised in the manuscript.
2) “…a new technique for …. are presented…” should be “…a new technique for … is presented” in the
Page 5, Row 7.
Answer: It has been revised in the manuscript.
3) “it was decided … , is used to design and construct the station” I think is better to change with “it
was decided to use … for the design and the construction of the station ” in the Page 5, Rows 47-48
Answer: It has been revised in the manuscript.
4) The cross-references to Fig. 9a,b,c,d,e are not correct. I think these references are related to Fig. 6
in the Page 7.
Answer: It has been revised in the manuscript.
5) “he overburden pressure” should be “the overburden pressure” in the Page 8, Row 3.
Answer: It has been revised in the manuscript.
6) Page 16, Row 29: of STS structure has s high stiffness? Maybe it should be “a”.
Answer: It has been revised in the manuscript.
7) “flange flanges” in the Page 23 Row 3?
Answer: It has been revised in the manuscript.
