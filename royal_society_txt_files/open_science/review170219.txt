The manuscript by Chopard et al entitled A physical description of the adhesion and aggregation
of platelets describes a numerical model of the aggregation of blood platelets under low shear
rate conditions. The numerical model is derived from cone-&-plate experimental data and utilises
a novel digital holographic microscopy approach to interrogate the 3-dimensional structure of
platelet aggregates that form as a function of time at the plate surface. In addition to using this
experimental model to validate the numerical simulation the authors conclude that albumin
deposition from blood plasma is a key limiter of aggregate growth at 100.s-1.
Main comments:
1. The experimental method involves platelet adhesion to an unfunctionalised
polycarbonate substrate that lacks any of the physiologically relevant platelet adhesion ligands
such as type 1 collagen, fibrinogen, or VWF. Given that specific adhesion receptor engagement
has been demonstrated to play a significant role in the degree of platelet activation and the
overall 3-dimensional structure of platelet aggregates the use of a non-physiological
polycarbonate substrate seems to be a major limitation of the experimental design and limits any
interpretation of the model to the specific case described.
2. While I agree that at the relatively low shear rate described in the experimental section
will limit the involvement of platelet GPIb – VWF engagement in driving aggregate formation,
under these conditions this adhesion interaction cannot be discounted completely. I suggest that
the authors need to show full validation of their experimental setup by conducting experiments
in which GPIb – VWF engagement is blocked using an antibody such as AK2 and where platelet
integrin is blocked using for example c7E3 Fab.
3. Both the numerical model and the 3D imaging data are contingent on 3-dimensional
aggregate growth. Fig 2 does not show 3-dimensional platelet aggregation but rather, spread
platelet monolayer formation at the polycarbonate surface with at best 1 or two spherical platelets
attached. Based on the data shown it is questionable as to whether the experimental system as
described is capable of triggering aggregation per se.
4. One of the primary conclusions of the study is that adsorption of blood albumin is a
major limiter of 3-dimensional platelet aggregation. This conclusion is no supported by the body
of evidence presented in the literature describing the platelet aggregation mechanism.
Furthermore shear induced platelet aggregation SIPA is contingent of both VWF binding and
ADP dependent signalling. At the low shear rate described in this study the principle limiter of
the aggregation response is the lack of VWF dependent platelet interactions. It could be argued
that albumin adhesion is a by-product of the polycarbonate surface utilised, dependent on the
affinity of this substrate for HSA. I suggest that the authors need to conduct experiments using
relevant immobilised substrates and investigate the effect of albumin adsorption under these
conditions.
5. I question whether the cone-&-plate approach is a useful model of the type of
unidirectional/ laminar flow present in the vasculature. Given the closed nature of the C&P
entrapment of secreted soluble agonists from both platelets and RBC may play a significant part
in modulating platelet activation and aggregation, the effect of which may significantly diverge
from the laminar unidirectional flow case.
Minor comments:
1. The authors claim that their 3D imaging system has allowed them “to study the
development of the aggregates thickness, a quantity never measured before to our knowledge”.
This statement is not accurate. A number of studies have utilised both SEM and confocal imaging
(both live cell and fixed) to study and measure the rate and extent of 3-dimensional platelet
aggregation.
3
Overall, I agree with the authors that there exists significant limitations to current numerical
models describing platelet aggregation mechanisms under shear conditions. However,
improvements in numerical models are dependent on the experimental models used for
validation purposes. A major weakness of this study lies with the poorly characterised
experimental model utilised. Any experimental system used to derive improved numerical
models needs to incorporate both flow conditions (and appropriate shear rates) that closely
model that found in the vasculature and also incorporate and characterise the relevant surface
ligands an secreted chemical species known to drive 3-dimensional platelet aggregation. To this
end the current study describes the specific case of platelet aggregation at polycarbonate in the
Impact-R and any interpretation of the numerical model findings need to be clearly restricted to
this very limited context.

This is a well-designed and performed study presenting a detailed set of in-vitro experiments
accompanied by a proposed numerical model (fitting the experimental data). This model helps to
better describe and understand the early stages of platelets adhesion-aggregation. The study
provides evidence that blood albumin is a major parameter limiting platelet aggregate formation.
It provides quantitative estimates of the adhesion and aggregation rates as well as a value of the
effective diffusion of platelets in blood subject to low shear rate.
Comments:
1. The 3D structure of platelet aggregates (Fig 2) and the proposed model are relevant to
low shear (100 s-1) at which the aggregate average size is small. It is of interest to explore (or
discuss) the 3D shape of platelet aggregates at a higher shear rate (1800 or 5000 s-1) at which the
aggregate average size is bigger (see Supplement Fig. 1). Furthermore, what is/are the
appropriate model/parameters for this high shear rate?
2. Page 2 - Experimental setup: It is not clear in the main text whether the authors are using
the Impact-R Cone as the rotating part creating a laminar flow or they are using another rotating
flat disk, it is indicated only in the supplementary material. Furthermore, the following part of
4
the sentence is not clear “…..by the rotation movement of a second disk, aligned with the x-y-
plate, placed at 0.82 mm, according to the Cone and Plate principal.”
3. It is assumed that platelets do not adhere directly to the “bare” polystyrene but to
plasma adhesive proteins, such as VWF and fibrinogen, that bind to the polystyrene surface and
then go through a conformational change that makes them attractive for platelet receptors. So, the
bound fibrinogen and VWF are making the polystyrene a thrombogenic surface. (see: Shenkman
et al., Thromb. Res. 99:353-361, 2000; Savion and Varon, J. Pathophysiol. Haemost. Thromb. 35:
83-88, 2006). So, on page 5 second paragraph, the indicated competition between platelets and
albumin is probably reflecting the competition between albumin and VWF/fibrinogen binding to
the polystyrene which than determines the degree of surface adhesiveness for platelets. This
point should be discussed.
4. The decrease in platelet number in the suspension following platelet activation by
agonist (ADP) or high shear rate and its impact on platelet adhesion was studied and discussed
in the following paper: Savion et al., Brit. J. Haematol. 112: 1055-1061, 2001.

Overall, the main points raised by the reviewer were discussed during the first review and in
he supplementary data. We have now complemented the supplementary data with our previous
esponses to the first reviewers.
Minor comments:
1. The authors claim that their 3D imaging system has allowed them “to study the
development of the aggregates thickness, a quantity never measured before to our
knowledge”. This statement is not accurate. A number of studies have utilised
both SEM and confocal imaging (both live cell and fixed) to study and measure
the rate and extent of 3-dimensional platelet aggregation.
With regard to this particular point. It is true that it is possible to measure the volume of a
platelet aggregate in confocal or SEM. However, it is not possible to have such a large statistic
as we have obtained with holographic microscopy. This quantification has also been published
and validated (Zouaoui Boudjeltia K et al., Biomedical Optic Express 5015, 6: 3556-3563).
As an example, here is an SEM image of a platelet aggregate that we have produced. To measure
he volume of the aggregate one first need to put the sample at 45° and then apply the
rigonometric projection rules to obtain the heights. Unlike wise, the holographic interferometry
makes it possible to have in one image the height of the whole object to be studied with a
precision of 17nm on the Z axis.
With an automatic analysis of a field of view it is possible to analyze a large number of
aggregates at once. This important since 7 images per well were produced.
Regarding confocal microscope, this method requires a scan at different focal plan on each
aggregates. This procedure is difficult to use for a large statistic.
Overall, I agree with the authors that there exists significant limitations to current numerical
models describing platelet aggregation mechanisms under shear conditions. However,
mprovements in numerical models are dependent on the experimental models used for
validation purposes. A major weakness of this study lies with the poorly characterised
experimental model utilised. Any experimental system used to derive improved numerical
models needs to incorporate both flow conditions (and appropriate shear rates) that closely
model that found in the vasculature and also incorporate and characterise the relevant surface
igands an secreted chemical species known to drive 3-dimensional platelet aggregation. To this
mpact-R and any interpretation of the numerical model findings need to be clearly restricted
o this very limited context.
We have indicated that our results have been found with a specific device.

This is a well-designed and performed study presenting a detailed set of in-vitro experiments
accompanied by a proposed numerical model (fitting the experimental data). This model helps
o better describe and understand the early stages of platelets adhesion-aggregation. The study
provides evidence that blood albumin is a major parameter limiting platelet aggregate
ormation. It provides quantitative estimates of the adhesion and aggregation rates as well as a
value of the effective diffusion of platelets in blood subject to low shear rate.
Comments:
1. The 3D structure of platelet aggregates (Fig 2) and the proposed model are relevant
to low shear (100 s-1) at which the aggregate average size is small. It is of interest
to explore (or discuss) the 3D shape of platelet aggregates at a higher shear rate
(1800 or 5000 s-1) at which the aggregate average size is bigger (see Supplement
Fig. 1). Furthermore, what is/are the appropriate model/parameters for this high
shear rate?
This is of course an interesting question, but beyond the scope of our present paper as
we would need to repeat the full set of experiments at these higher shear rate. And we
should find the blood of the same donors. But our methodology is able to answer this
question. In the current version of the manuscript we make it clear that our results are
expected to depend on the shear rate and the composition of the substrate.
2. Page 2 - Experimental setup: It is not clear in the main text whether the authors are
using the Impact-R Cone as the rotating part creating a laminar flow or they are
using another rotating flat disk, it is indicated only in the supplementary material.
Furthermore, the following part of the sentence is not clear “…..by the rotation
movement of a second disk, aligned with the x-y-plate, placed at 0.82 mm,
according to the Cone and Plate principal.”
This point has been modified in the manuscript.
3. It is assumed that platelets do not adhere directly to the “bare” polystyrene but to
plasma adhesive proteins, such as VWF and fibrinogen, that bind to the
polystyrene surface and then go through a conformational change that makes them
attractive for platelet receptors. So, the bound fibrinogen and VWF are making
the polystyrene a thrombogenic surface. (see: Shenkman et al., Thromb. Res.
99:353-361, 2000; Savion and Varon, J. Pathophysiol. Haemost. Thromb. 35: 83-
88, 2006). So, on page 5 second paragraph, the indicated competition between
platelets and albumin is probably reflecting the competition between albumin and
surface adhesiveness for platelets. This point should be discussed.
In order to address these interesting remarks, we added some experimental results
in the supplementary data and comments have been integrated in the “Results and
Discussion” section. The reference of Shenkman et al has been also added.
4. The decrease in platelet number in the suspension following platelet activation by
agonist (ADP) or high shear rate and its impact on platelet adhesion was studied
and discussed in the following paper: Savion et al., Brit. J. Haematol. 112: 1055-
1061, 2001.
Driven by the pertinence of this question a new set of experiments was performed in order to study the
mpact of the addition of external ADP or its antagonist prostaglandin E1 (PGR1) in the experimental
ystem. These molecules were added to the blood sample and incubated for 1 minute under agitation
before starting the test. Samples were exposed to a laminar flow with imposed shear rate of 100 s -1. Two
exposition times were tested: 20 and 120 seconds.

seconds (blue). T0 corresponds to the concentration of platelets before starting the test (n=2) in tube just
after the venipuncture.
Results indicate that the addition of external ADP, as expected, potentiates the aggregation of platelets.
The aggregates formed on the polystyrene surface were fewer in number but significantly bigger (as
compared to the control condition). Additionally, it was observed an important decrease in the number
of platelets in suspension in the sample following the test, which indicates that the addition of external
ADP increased the reactivity of platelets.
Interestingly, an antagonist of the ADP pathway (PGE1) in our model does not changes the platelet
n suspension and the aggregate sizes. This suggests that in our experimental setup the intrinsic ADP
does not plays a critical role.
