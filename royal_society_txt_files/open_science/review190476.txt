Paper is well written a makes a contribution to the state of the art. The figures are clear and well
explained in the text of the paper. Development of the governing equations and their application
to specific scenarios is also well done.
However the actual robotic comparison could be improved and stands as a lost opportunity.
Note:
- the 1N resolution is sufficient from a gage R&R point of view to achieve the required results.
- What is the effect of the .1 mm error on the results?
- do the curved in figure 17 have a smoothing function?
- how are these experimental results compared to the calculated values? "here was a good
agreement between theoretical and experimental results." this needs to be show and further
explained.
- what are the conclusions from the experimental part of the paper? Should this be left out of the
paper until more definitive results have been achieved.
Look forward to seeing a revision.

1. Further details of the experimental design needs to be included in section 5.1, in particular how
to confirm that method to ensure the same initial lateral error and angular error in the
experimental setup is accurate.
2. What were the limitations of the experimental design?

Following are minor questions I have during the reading of the manuscript:
1. The authors are not taking into account the geometric tolerances that may be present during
any manufacturing process. How will the presence of tolerances affect their analysis? Will this be
just a static shift taken into consideration, or will it require a different approach to the problem?
2. How does the current analysis consider the presence of friction at the contact point(s) between
the peg and hole? What role will it play in governing the lateral or angular stiffness of the
compliance mechanism, if that is a factor?
3. During experimentation, how repeatable are the results when considering errors in positioning
the peg and also in manipulating the peg within the hole? Can the authors provide possibilities in
reducing the variability due to these factors when performing experiments?
4. This might be a minor detail: when the compliance center is located near the tip of the peg, for
two-point contact, are there conditions under which the entire process becomes self-locking?

er is well written a makes a contribution to the state of the art. The figures are
ar and well explained in the text of the paper. Development of the governing
ations and their application to specific scenarios is also well done.
viewer#1, Comment # 1: The 1N resolution is sufficient from a gage R&R point
view to achieve the required results. What is the effect of the .1 mm error on the
ults?
thor response:
e experiment was repeated at least three times; the consistency of the results
ved that the effects of the repeatability of the robots were negligible.
thor action:
have revised the manuscript. Please see the yellow highlighting in Section 5.1.
viewer#1, Comment # 2: Do the curved in figure 17 have a smoothing function?
thor response:
s, the curves shown in the figure are the processed results from the original
erimental data by the polynomial fitting method.
thor action:
have added a note to Figure 16 (Figure 17 in the old version).
viewer#1, Comment # 3: How are these experimental results compared to the
culated values? "here was a good agreement between theoretical and experimental
ults." this needs to be show and further explained.
thor response:
high extraction force is a sign of two-point contact. When the compliance centre
s far from the tip of the peg, the two-point contact region was the largest,
denced by the high and wide peak of the red curve. With a decrease in LC , the
-point contact region was reduced as shown by the narrower and lower peaks of
blue and black curves. These experimental results confirm the theoretical
dictions of Figs. 12 and 13.
thor action:
have revised the manuscript. Please see the yellow highlighting in Section 5.2.
viewer#1, Comment # 4: What are the conclusions from the experimental part of
paper? Should this be left out of the paper until more definitive results have been
ieved.
thor response:
shown above, the experiment results agree well with the theoretical prediction.
are keeping the experimental part of the paper to show that the theoretical
lysis has been experimentally validated.
viewer#2, Comment # 1: Further details of the experimental design needs to be
luded in section 5.1, in particular how to confirm that method to ensure the same
ial lateral error and angular error in the experimental setup is accurate.
thor response:
e robot was programmed to move to the same start position before beginning to
l the peg out of the hole. The start position was chosen to induce the desired
tact forces on the peg. It was found that the position repeatability of the robot
.1mm) was sufficient to ensure the initial contact forces were within the required
rance (±2 N).
thor action:
have revised the manuscript. Please see the blue highlighting in Section 5.1.
viewer#2, Comment # 2: What were the limitations of the experimental design?
thor response:
e limitation was the repeatability of the robot and force measurements which we
e now specified.
viewer#2, Comment # 3: Page 23 states that "Although inaccuracies in the
rent experiment had no impact on the trends of the results" - this needs to be
rified and if there could be implications for other similar experiments but with
erent variables?
thor response:
s statement refers to the difficulty of measuring lateral and angular errors. If they
be measured accurately, more analysis can be carried out. The absence of such
lysis does not affect the current conclusion of the paper.
thor action:
avoid confusion, we have amended the text slightly.
viewer#2, Comment # 4: It is important to discuss the main contributions of this
er, and how this has an influence on control for remanufacturing.
thor action:
have revised Conclusion. Please see the yellow highlighting in Conclusion.
viewer#2, Comment # 5: Some papers are rather old, such as reference no 7 from
4? (page 24); or page 25 from 1979?
thor response:
e old references represent key developments of using RCC to assist robotic
embly. We adopted a similar approach in the study of robotic disassembly. To our
wledge, there are no papers on disassembly mechanics so far.
viewer#3:
lowing are minor questions I have during the reading of the manuscript:
viewer#3, Comment # 1: The authors are not taking into account the geometric
rances that may be present during any manufacturing process. How will the
sence of tolerances affect their analysis? Will this be just a static shift taken into
sideration, or will it require a different approach to the problem?
thor response:
e errors in diameters caused by manufacturing processes can be reflected by the
metric tolerance which has been considered in the model as shown in Section 3.1.
he manufacturing processes cause the shape of the pin or the hole to change, the
oval process should be modelled differently and this is beyond the scope of this
earch.
viewer#3, Comment # 2: How does the current analysis consider the presence of
tion at the contact point(s) between the peg and hole? What role will it play in
erning the lateral or angular stiffness of the compliance mechanism, if that is a
tor?
thor response:
used Coulomb friction in the modelling, as shown in Equations 4-6 in Section 3.1,
ich has been applied to a series of previous research on assembly mechanics.
termining the stiffness of compliance is an independent topic and beyond the
pe of this paper.
viewer#3, Comment # 3: During experimentation, how repeatable are the results
en considering errors in positioning the peg and also in manipulating the peg
hin the hole? Can the authors provide possibilities in reducing the variability due
hese factors when performing experiments?
thor response:
was found that the position repeatability of the robot (±0.1mm) was sufficient to
ure the initial contact forces were within the required tolerance (±2 N).
e experiment was repeated at least three times; the consistency of the results
ved that the effects of the repeatability of the robots were negligible.
thor action:
have revised the manuscript. Please see the highlighting parts in Sections 5.1 and
.
viewer#3, Comment # 4: This might be a minor detail: when the compliance
ter is located near the tip of the peg, for two-point contact, are there conditions
er which the entire process becomes self-locking?
thor response:
e purpose of locating the compliance centre near the tip of the peg is to reduce the
lihood of self-locking as shown in Figs. 12 and 13 in the paper (and also, in the
text of assembly, in the work of Whitney etc.)
