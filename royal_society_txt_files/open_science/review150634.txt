This paper addresses the important and challenging problem in environmental toxicology of
relating PCB exposure to toxicological impacts to wildlife populations, in this case Tree Swallows,
and I think it will be a significant contribution to the field. The paper is well written and the
methods and results are well presented. The authors did a very good job of explaining how and
why they performed the meta analysis of the field studies they examined which will be helpful
for readers who are not very knowledgeable about the statistical methods of meta analysis. The
discussion provides a thorough and sound interpretation of their results as well as associated
caveats.

The paper is clear and suggests that PCB exposure in wild tree swallows has little effect on short
term correlates of fitness such as hatching success, and surprisingly, a positive effect in one
analysis. The study is well justified in the introduction, is accurately captured in the title and
abstract, and methods are expertly detailed. The finding that PCB improves performance could
be very revealing of the flaws in the original studies, and an additional explanation should be
included in the discussion. This finding is at odds with much data from dosing studies, and
3
seems non-sensical at first pass. The four possible confounds mentioned are 1) dosing studies are
often done on domestic animals which might be "overly" sensitive due to artificial selection for
other attributes, 2) reference sites may have been populated with lower quality individuals due to
biased site selection (e.g., all the good sites near the river are contaminated with PCBs), 3) PCBs
are complex mixtures and so there is excess variation in field studies (and other pollutants are
present in differing quantities), and 4) the "wrong" metrics were used in the studies, with longer
term measures being the ones that would have shown effects. The authors in in stating that none
of these confounds would predict a positive relationship between PCB exposure and
reproductive success. The second explanation does make that prediction - if more experienced or
better-quality birds are able to obtain territories in sites with more food, and these sites tend to be
at sites that are more polluted, one would predict a spurious positive association between PCB
and reproductive success (as long as effects of PCB were not too severe). But there is a much
bigger problem with all of these studies that needs to be discussed. This is a fundamental flaw in
all field studies of effects of pollution and works in favor of responsible parties such as General
Electric that often fund ecotoxicology studies. the flaw is simply this: the individuals being
studied at these sites are the survivors of strong selection by the pollutant. They have attributes,
in some cases heritable, that allowed them to survive, claim a territory, and lay eggs - otherwise
they would not have been included in the study. Individuals that are sensitive to the pollutant
have died, failed to compete, or failed to lay eggs, and thus are not included in the study. On the
reference site, these individuals are included in the sample because, with lower levels of PCB,
they are more likely to at least get as far as laying eggs in a nestbox. On the contaminated sites the
pollution-resistant individuals may have other attributes that help them live longer or have more
babies, such as better anti-oxidant systems. Selection over decades may have occurred, but a
single generation is enough to produce this effect, even for a trait that is not heritable, because
selective mortality will occur anew each season. Thus, when an ecotoxicology study shows an
effect of a pollutant, the pollutant has overwhelmed the abilities of even the best quality birds in
the population. Many field studies will show no deleterious effect or even an ameliorative effect,
even for pollutants that show strong negative effects in captive dosing studies, and it is for none
of the four reasons discussed. This is a great opportunity to make this important point AND
explain the unexpected result in your paper.

ank you for pointing out this area of confusion. What I was trying to explain with
s statement is that none of these confounds would predict an increase in fitness as
degree of contamination of the contaminated site increased relative to the
erence site, which is in fact what I found (a positive relation between relative
ess and relative contamination level). While explanation 2 (lower quality
ividuals in reference sites) does predict higher fitness in individuals in
taminated sites, it does not predict that fitness would increase with relative
tamination. I have attempted to clarify this explanation (lines 378-381).
there is a much bigger problem with all of these studies that needs to be discussed. This
fundamental flaw in all field studies of effects of pollution and works in favor of
ponsible parties such as General Electric that often fund ecotoxicology studies. The flaw
imply this: the individuals being studied at these sites are the survivors of strong
ection by the pollutant. They have attributes, in some cases heritable, that allowed them
urvive, claim a territory, and lay eggs - otherwise they would not have been included in
study. Individuals that are sensitive to the pollutant have died, failed to compete, or
ed to lay eggs, and thus are not included in the study. On the reference site, these
ividuals are included in the sample because, with lower levels of PCB, they are more
ly to at least get as far as laying eggs in a nestbox. On the contaminated sites the
lution-resistant individuals may have other attributes that help them live longer or have
re babies, such as better anti-oxidant systems. Selection over decades may have
urred, but a single generation is enough to produce this effect, even for a trait that is not
itable, because selective mortality will occur anew each season. Thus, when an
toxicology study shows an effect of a pollutant, the pollutant has overwhelmed the
lities of even the best quality birds in the population. Many field studies will show no
eterious effect or even an ameliorative effect, even for pollutants that show strong
ative effects in captive dosing studies, and it is for none of the four reasons discussed.
s is a great opportunity to make this important point AND explain the unexpected result
our paper.
ave added this potential explanation of our findings on lines 392-398 and 421-423.
