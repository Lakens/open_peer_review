Investigating the acceptor range of mutant endo-CC N180H enzyme is indeed important. But the

The authors have adequately addressed all the major concerns raised by the reviewers. The
additional data also confirmed the identity and purity of the key products from
7
transglycosylation. The quality of the manuscript is much improved. I can recommend the
publication of the revised manuscript pending a few minor revisions as indicated below:
1) the drawing of the product from the transglycosylation missed one GlcNAc moiety - It should
have two (one transformed from the oxazoline and one from the acceptor).
2) For the antibody glycosylation, the molar ratio of SGP to the GlcNAc-antibody should be
clearly indicated when talking about the yield, as the yield is dependent on the molar ratio of the
donor to acceptor.
3) The yield (85%) is very impressive, but it should be also mentioned that the product still
contains some of the GlcNSAc-antibody, which may or may not be easy to separate from the
product.

Dear Professor James Moore
Publishing Editor, Journals
Royal Society Open Science
6th February 2018
Dear Professor James Moore
We are most grateful to you and the reviewers for the helpful comments
regarding the original version of our manuscript (RSOS-171521) entitled,
“Acceptor range of endo-ß-N-acetylglucosaminidase Mutant endo-CC N180H:
from Monosaccharide to Antibody" for Royal Society Open Science. We have
taken all these comments into consideration and have effected the
recommendations as detailed below:
Reviewer #1: Investigating the acceptor range of mutant endo-CC N180H enzyme is indeed
important. But the structures of compounds 4a, 4b, 5a, 5b, 6a, 6b, 7a and 7b that the authors
are referring to are not seen in the manuscript, neither are their complete names available.
Therefore, in order to make the reviewing process effective, I suggest: The authors provide a
complete list of structures of compounds they are referring to; the captions to the
Schemes/Figures/Tables placed preferably along side (at the bottom of) the respective item;
and if a list is given separately, they must be in the same order as the items in the list. The best
presentation of the manuscript will be one in which the Schemes, Figures, etc are embedded in
the text as required.
We have submitted Figures and Schemes in different files according to
manuscript central guidelines, and the Table was attached at the end of
manuscript in the initial file. However, all our Figures and Schemes are now
embedded in the text as the reviewer suggested. As reviewer 2 mentioned, this
comments are made from mistake of compound numbering. We made
correction on numbering, so we think uncertainty is now solved.
Reviewer #2:
Dr. Shino and co-workers describe in this manuscript further studies on the acceptor substrate
specificity of a previously reported endoglycosidase mutant, endo-CC N180H derived from
fungus Coprinopsis cinerea. The studies indicated that Endo-CC N180H has similar acceptor
substrate specificity as that of Endo-M and its mutant, capable of accepting GlcNAc and Glc
derivatives, but not Gal, Xyl, or some other modified sugars. Here the authors used a stable
ground state sialoglycopeptide instead of the active sugar oxazoline as the donor substrate for
the transglycosylation, which relies on the use of large excess of the donor substrate to drive
the reaction to favor product formation, as demonstrated in many early typical synthetic
applications of endoglycosidase-catalyzed transglycosylation, because the product is also
subject to hydrolysis. In addition, the authors describe a preliminary study on transfer of glycan
to a deglycosylated antibody. The results are interesting. However, there are several major
concerns, as indicated below, that are required to address before the manuscript is acceptable
for publication.
1) Active sugar oxazolines vs. ground-state donor substrates. The use of sugar oxazoline, the
mimic of the enzymatic oxazolinium intermediate, for ENGase-catalyzed transglycosylation to
make homogeneous glycopeptides and glycoproteins has been well established and is
emerging as one of the most efficient methods to access homogeneous materials (see refs. 10
and 11). The statement on the side reactions were somewhat exaggerated in the introduction.
In the two reports (refs. 24 and 25) showing reactions of sugar oxazolines with primary amines,
the conditions used (high pH, heating, long reaction time, etc) are not quite relevant to that used
for ENGase-catalyzed reactions. Side reactions did occur when large amount of sugar
oxazoline and prolonged time were used in the case of herceptin glycan remodeling as reported
by Davis and co-workers (ref. 23). But the side reactions could be largely minimized when
appropriate amount of sugar oxazoline and more enzyme were used. More recently, much more
efficiently glycosynthase mutants such as the Endo-S2 mutants were reported by Wang and co-
workers, and the experiments showed that essentially quantitative conversion of the glycan
remodeling without detectable side reactions could be achieved as demonstrated by glycan
remodeling of rituximab and herceptin with careful LC-MS analysis of the products (see for
example, Li T. et al, JBC, 2016; Li, T. et al, PNAS, 2017). Using SGP as the donor substrate is
quite OK for the present studies. But it doesn’t necessarily mean it is more efficient than the
sugar oxazoline approach. The introduction should be revised to reflect the facts.
We agree. We have revised Introduction as reviewer suggested. JBC and
PNAS papers were added, and suppression of side-reaction strategy was
described.
2) The study on the acceptor substrate specificity of Endo-CC N180H was valuable for the
community, but an appropriate comparison between Endo-CC and Endo-M and/or Endo-A for
their acceptor substrate specificity (as reported before) should be given in the discussions.
In previous papers, the product structure for endo-M-N175Q was not clearly
demonstrated. Accordingly, we carried out the glycan transfer reaction using
Endo-M-N175Q ourselves, and our results were added to Table 1.
3) The yield of the mutant N180H catalyzed transglycosylation of deglycosylated antibody
should be reported. It should be also clearly stated in the discussion that about 40000 fold
(molar) excess of the donor substrate SGP was used in this case. Again, using large excess of
donor substrate to drive an enzymatic transglycosylation is not a new concept. When 395
mg/mL of SGP and 1.4 mg/mL of the antibody were used, the antibody and the enzyme are like
swimming in the sugar syrup.
The reviewer's point is true. We added our comment in Conclusion. We hope
that in near future, we will be able to improve our results.
4) It was claimed that Man-PNP was an acceptor and gave 41% yield. The authors are
suggested to confirm that the glycan is attached to the 4-OH instead of other sites in this case.
We confirmed the structure by HMBC correlation together with TOCSY, 2D
DQF-COSY, 2D DQF-COSY, 1H-13C HSQC, and 13C-coupled 1H-13C-HSQC
spectra. The linkage is definitely though 4-OH.
5) Table 1. The numbers and structures appeared messed up and should be corrected.
Thank you, compound numbers have been corrected.
We hope that the revised version of our paper is now suitable for publication in
Royal Society Open Science and look forward to hearing from you at your
earliest convenience.
Thank you for your time and review.

Dear Dr. Thomas Foley
We are most grateful to you, the reviewers for the helpful comments regarding on
our manuscript (ID 9062331) entitled, “Acceptor range of endo-ß-N-
acetylglucosaminidase Mutant endo-CC N180H: from Monosaccharide to
Antibody” for Royal Society Open Science. Especially, we would like to thank
reviewer 2 for positive comments. We have taken all these comments into
consideration and have affected the recommendations as detailed below:
Comments to the Author(s)

The authors have adequately addressed all the major concerns raised by the
reviewers. The additional data also confirmed the identity and purity of the key
products from transglycosylation. The quality of the manuscript is much
improved. I can recommend the publication of the revised manuscript pending a
few minor revisions as indicated below:
1) the drawing of the product from the transglycosylation missed one GlcNAc
moiety - It should have two (one transformed from the oxazoline and one from
the acceptor).
<U+2192>We added GlcNAc in Scheme 1.
2) For the antibody glycosylation, the molar ratio of SGP to the GlcNAc-antibody
should be clearly indicated when talking about the yield, as the yield is
dependent on the molar ratio of the donor to acceptor.
<U+2192>We added sentence as reviewer suggested. "High concentrations of SGP
(molar ratio of SGP to antibody = 15,000) increased yield of the fully
glycosylated antibody in 85% yield (UPLC calculation yield)."
3) The yield (85%) is very impressive, but it should be also mentioned that the
product still contains some of the GlcNSAc-antibody, which may or may not be
easy to separate from the product.
<U+2192>We added sentence as reviewer suggested. "The fully glycosylated antibody
was isolated from partially glycosylated and GlcNAc-type antibodies using
cation exchange column."
We have already ethics statement, competing interests, authors' contributions,
Acknowledgements, funding statement in our manuscript. We have already
submitted supporting information.
We hope the revised version of manuscript is now acceptable for your journal.
Sincerely yours,
Shino Manabe, Ph.D.
