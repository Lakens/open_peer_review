This paper reports topological and use-wear features of hammerstones used by wild macaques to
crack oil palm nuts, an introduced species now available to them. The findings are compared to
what is known of use-wear on other stones used by this same species to process other foods, and
by chimpanzees to process the same kind of nuts. The manuscript is generally clear. I am not an
archaeologist, so I cannot comment on the details of the methodology, although I found it easy to
understand. The findings will be of interest to a general reader, and more so following revisions
suggested below. I note two general problems with writing and one with content.
1) The title is a long string of nouns used as adjectives - this is not good English usage as I learned
it, and it is not easy to understand, either. How about something like "The percussive signature
on stones used by Old World monkeys to crack oil palm nuts"?
2) The writing is awkward and clumsy, mainly due to the strong habit of using strings of nouns
as adjectives. This problem is evident in practically every sentence in the abstract and in virtually
every paragraph of the manuscript.
3) The authors have not made a sufficiently interesting story with their findings. For example,
the abstract lists "a high degree of battering and crushing on most surfaces" as the main finding.
But there is no indication in the abstract, nor in the rest of the manuscript, if this is a surprising
finding, or why this finding is important or interesting. The discussion compares use-wear on
stone tools across food types processed by macaques, and between macaques' stone tools and
those used by chimpanzees to crack oil palm nuts. I wanted to read more interpretation - more
about what the patterns of damage might mean for the macaques' and chimpanzees' behavior,
and the behavior of both of these species compared to hominin behavior. The topic finally arrived
at in the final paragraph before Conclusions hints at one such link but does not develop the idea
enough. Here the authors present an hypothesis linking the similar pattern of damage seen on the
stones used by macaques and stones used by extinct hominins to glancing blows of the
hammerstone against a stone anvil. Why is this important? Might it mean that the blows were not
well-aimed? That the nut slipped when struck? That the blows were too hard for the purpose?
That hominins and nonhuman primates are producing strikes in the same manner, despite their
very different body mass and limb proportions? Are the authors attributing the wear on the
stones to properties of the stone, the nut, the anvil, the actor, or the whole system? Does it
matter? The reader needs more interpretation here to understand what might be the value of
knowing these details about hammerstones used by various species, and what we need to do to
be able to make stronger inferences or to answer new questions.
In the first sentence of the abstract, "nonhuman" should precede "primate".

I find the revised manuscript improved. The relevance of the findings is clearer, and the writing
overall is clearer. I still find many places where strings of three or more nouns are used as
adjectives, or a string of adjective -noun - noun - adjective- noun, etc. A selection of these are
appended in a separate file. In a few places I indicate wording that I would find easier to
understand. Many cases include the use of a species' name as an adjective. These could easily be
altered by using the possessive form of the species' name. For example, to me, the title would
read better as "Analysis of wild macaques' stone tools used to crack oil palm nuts". Here is
another example: early hominin percussive behaviour. Is it early behavior? This would be
clearer as "early hominins' percussive behavior. Also, sometimes hammerstones are referred to as
"pound hammers" or "tools". It would be better if hammerstones are consistently referred to by
one label. These are all perhaps minor stylistic issues, but I expect that addressing them will
make the manuscript easier for people to read and understand, and thus increase the impact of
the work. (Appendix C)

iew results of the paper "Old world monkey oil palm nut-cracking stone
ls"
paper present the first detailed descriptions of the stone tools used by
iland macaques to crush the oil palm nuts. They also compared these tools
h ones used to crush other materials such as oysters and gastropods, and
s used by chimpanzees in Bossou. Because the authors reported the
ntitative analysis of the stone tools, it makes possible to relate the
ults from archeological findings on tool development by hominids. The
ding is quite interesting because it would give various research questions
m the perspectives such as complex motor learning, understanding of
sical rules, social transfer of technology, generalization of the skill,
mate tool evolution, and so on.
ow are the comments on the paper.
e 131: The authors found the stone hammers in the anvil sites. Do you find
relationships between the characteristics of the stone (size, shape, or
age pattern) and the anvils (i.e., Visalberghi et al. 2007)?
e 131: Do the monkeys crush only the oil palm nuts on these anvils? Or do
anvils function as general chopping board?
e 217-218: What is the meaning of the difference in the materials for
merstones? Is it related to the distance between the locations of the food
ources and stones? Or, do the monkeys preferentially use the stone made of
estone?
e 218: Do you find any difference in the dimensions between the samples
nd on the anvils and the ones from line transect?
e 220-221: The hammerstones for oil palm nut had intensive damages on all
und the surface. And there is variability in the weight of the stones.
n, what do these characteristics of the tools tell you about the user? Are
damages made by single or multiple monkeys (i.e. the hammers were selected
different monkeys)? From the types of the damage on the hammer surface, do
estimate the level of the technology of the user?
e 285-287: Move to Discussion section.
e 370-372: Move to Discussion section.
e 439: The difference in the size dimensions of stone tools used by
mpanzees and macaques can be attributable to their body sizes. However,
uchins use quite large stone tools relative to their body size (Ottoni &
r 2008). There seemed to be different paths to develop the stone tool use,
it would be related to anvil uses in chimpanzees and capuchins (actively
ipulating anvils (as a meta-tool) by chimpanzees (Inoue-Nakamura &
suzawa 1997) and selecting special anvils on the rock by capuchins
salberghi et al. 2007)). How about the macaques?

We would like to thank both reviewers for their constructive comments and observations. We have
addressed each issue raised below.
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_7
This paper reports topological and use-wear features of hammerstones used by wild macaques to
crack oil palm nuts, an introduced species now available to them. The findings are compared to what
is known of use-wear on other stones used by this same species to process other foods, and by
chimpanzees to process the same kind of nuts. The manuscript is generally clear. I am not an
archaeologist, so I cannot comment on the details of the methodology, although I found it easy to
understand. The findings will be of interest to a general reader, and more so following revisions
suggested below. I note two general problems with writing and one with content.
We thank the reviewer for their time, and for their observation that our study will be of interest to
general readers.
1) The title is a long string of nouns used as adjectives - this is not good English usage as I learned it,
and it is not easy to understand, either. How about something like "The percussive signature on
stones used by Old World monkeys to crack oil palm nuts"?
The title has been altered for clarity, and now reads “Analysis of wild macaque stone tools used to
crack oil palm nuts”
2) The writing is awkward and clumsy, mainly due to the strong habit of using strings of nouns as
adjectives. This problem is evident in practically every sentence in the abstract and in virtually every
paragraph of the manuscript.
The text has been edited throughout for clarity, and we appreciate the need to avoid clumsy
constructions. We would welcome details of any specific examples of this clumsiness that remain in
the revised paper.
3) The authors have not made a sufficiently interesting story with their findings. For example, the
abstract lists "a high degree of battering and crushing on most surfaces" as the main finding. But
there is no indication in the abstract, nor in the rest of the manuscript, if this is a surprising finding,
or why this finding is important or interesting.
Our study offers an observable, contemporary percussive primate behaviour that results in damage
patterns similar to those seen on chimpanzee and early hominin artefacts. We believe that the
importance of the study lies in its rigorous analysis of the physical results of such percussion, which
permits comparisons with other taxa and with other macaque percussive activities. We do not
believe that publishing a ‘sufficiently interesting story’ is or should be one of the aims of Royal
Society Open Science, although we accept that the reviewer’s opinion differs from our own.
The discussion compares use-wear on stone tools across food types processed by macaques, and
between macaques' stone tools and those used by chimpanzees to crack oil palm nuts. I wanted to
read more interpretation - more about what the patterns of damage might mean for the macaques'
and chimpanzees' behavior, and the behavior of both of these species compared to hominin
behavior.
The topic finally arrived at in the final paragraph before Conclusions hints at one such link but does
not develop the idea enough. Here the authors present an hypothesis linking the similar pattern of
damage seen on the stones used by macaques and stones used by extinct hominins to glancing
blows of the hammerstone against a stone anvil. Why is this important? Might it mean that the
blows were not well-aimed? That the nut slipped when struck? That the blows were too hard for the
purpose? That hominins and nonhuman primates are producing strikes in the same manner, despite
their very different body mass and limb proportions?
The precise percussive mechanisms involved in the production of hammerstones with fracture
angles is little known. The macaque oil palm percussion provides one possible behavioural model for
the production of hammerstones with fracture angles. This hypothesis, however, will require
additional experimental testing, which is beyond the scope of this paper. This point is made towards
the end of the discussion. We do not wish to speculate beyond the scope of our data in this report,
following direction from the journal that ‘conclusions are supported by the data’.
Are the authors attributing the wear on the stones to properties of the stone, the nut, the anvil, the
actor, or the whole system? Does it matter? The reader needs more interpretation here to
understand what might be the value of knowing these details about hammerstones used by various
species, and what we need to do to be able to make stronger inferences or to answer new
questions.
The percussive damage observed on the macaque oil palm hammerstone is a consequence of a
range of different factors. Each of these are discussed within the analysis and discussion of this
paper, and have been clarified in the revised text where necessary. The raw material will have had
an effect on the propensity of the hammerstone to develop percussive damage. The nut itself, as
well as sediment adhering to the nut, affects the degree of polish within the central regions of the
hammerstones, which is discussed in the microscopic use wear analysis section of the paper. We
also discuss the possible effect that the morphology of the anvil may have had on the development
of percussive damage on the hammerstone. Further, we discuss the fact that macaque handling of
the hammerstone, and the degree of dexterity whilst cracking nuts may have affected the degree of
percussive damage when compared to the more concentrated damage seen on chimpanzee
hammerstones.
In the first sentence of the abstract, "nonhuman" should precede "primate".

Review results of the paper "Old world monkey oil palm nut-cracking stone tools" The paper present
the first detailed descriptions of the stone tools used by Thailand macaques to crush the oil palm
nuts. They also compared these tools with ones used to crush other materials such as oysters and
gastropods, and ones used by chimpanzees in Bossou. Because the authors reported the
quantitative analysis of the stone tools, it makes possible to relate the results from archeological
findings on tool development by hominids. The finding is quite interesting because it would give
various research questions from the perspectives such as complex motor learning, understanding of
physical rules, social transfer of technology, generalization of the skill, primate tool evolution, and so
on.
We thank the reviewer for their time, and appreciate that they find the study interesting from a
variety of different perspectives.
Below are the comments on the paper.
line 131: The authors found the stone hammers in the anvil sites. Do you find any relationships
between the characteristics of the stone (size, shape, or damage pattern) and the anvils (i.e.,
Visalberghi et al. 2007)?
In our paper, we postulate that the increased degree of percussive damage on the oil palm
hammerstones may be due to the undulating morphology of the anvils used (Line 424- 427). We
have made this point more explicit by adding “As such, they are more likely to come into contact
with the hammerstone…”. The relevant sentences now read “Unlike on typical gastropod
hammerstones used at the coast, crushing damage on oil palm tools used in inland forests is not
consistently confined to the central region of the working surface, instead it is located across
topographic high regions and intersecting ridges, caused by repeated miss-hits of the hammer
against the stone anvil. This may be a consequence of differing anvil morphologies at the different
ecological settings, with oil palm anvils often possessing an undulating morphology (Supplementary
Material 1). As such, they are more likely to come into contact with the hammerstone, compared to
the tide-worn flatter surface of coastal anvils”
line 131: Do the monkeys crush only the oil palm nuts on these anvils? Or do the anvils function as
general chopping board?
The macaques have only been recorded using these anvils and hammerstones to crack open oil palm
nuts. Our initial announcement of the behaviour (Luncz et al, 2017) states clearly that only oil palm
nuts were observed to have been opened. This point has been made clear in the text within the
materials and methods section. This sentence now reads: “Hammerstones were identified by their
association with large stone anvils on which macaques had exclusively cracked oil palm nuts…”.
line 217-218: What is the meaning of the difference in the materials for hammerstones? Is it related
to the distance between the locations of the food resources and stones? Or, do the monkeys
preferentially use the stone made of limestone?
We found no preference in raw material selection, as the range and ratio of hammerstone raw
materials adheres closely to the natural ratio of available raw material within the landscape. This
point is clearly stated in our initial behavioural announcement paper (Luncz et al, 2017). The same
point is also made in the discussion section of this paper, with the added caveat that future work on
this matter may elucidate additional raw material characteristics that affect macaque selection
preferences.
line 218: Do you find any difference in the dimensions between the samples found on the anvils and
the ones from line transect?
Please note that the ‘transect’ sample of hammerstones were also found at anvil sites, as described
in our Methods; they only have a different name in order to assist with our descriptions in the paper.
We have changed the term ‘Anvil sample’ to ‘Use-wear sample’ to avoid this potential ambiguity.
The hammerstones in our intensively studied ‘anvil/use-wear’ sample (n=13) are larger on average
than those found in our ‘transect’ sample (n=335), as the data in our paper show. However, they
were selected to represent the development of wear characteristics at the site, not for their size.
Our comparisons with other taxa and macaque behaviours use the combined anvil and transect
samples (n=348), to avoid any effects of this size difference.
line 220-221: The hammerstones for oil palm nut had intensive damages on all around the surface.
And there is variability in the weight of the stones. Then, what do these characteristics of the tools
tell you about the user? Are the damages made by single or multiple monkeys (i.e. the hammers
were selected by different monkeys)? From the types of the damage on the hammer surface, do you
estimate the level of the technology of the user?
As the monkeys are non-habituated, such fine data resolution is not yet possible. At present, based
on our extensive experience with all other wild stone tool using primates, including other macaques,
we expect that the percussive damage observed on the hammerstones was produced by multiple
individuals over successive nut cracking sessions. This point has been stated in the manuscript. The
degree of damage on the macaque hammerstones may indeed indicate a difference in the abilities
of macaques to finely manipulate oil palm nut cracking hammerstones, compared to chimpanzees.
This point is made in the discussion.

line 439: The difference in the size dimensions of stone tools used by chimpanzees and macaques
can be attributable to their body sizes. However, capuchins use quite large stone tools relative to
their body size (Ottoni & Izar 2008). There seemed to be different paths to develop the stone tool
use, and it would be related to anvil uses in chimpanzees and capuchins (actively manipulating anvils
(as a meta-tool) by chimpanzees (Inoue-Nakamura & Matsuzawa 1997) and selecting special anvils
on the rock by capuchins (Visalberghi et al. 2007)). How about the macaques?
In this study we have not directly compared the hammerstone use of capuchins and the oil palm nut
cracking of macaques, because the capuchins use hammerstones to crack different genera of nuts to
those of the macaques and Bossou chimpanzees. It has been shown that capuchins actively select
heavier hammerstones based on the hardness of the target. It is true that in Fazenda Boa Vista
capuchins often use large hammerstones to crack open hard encased nuts, however, in Serra da
Capivara, capuchins typically use smaller hammerstones to crack open ripe cashew nuts and soft
seeds and fruit.
As far as we understand, the choice of anvil does not dictate the dimensions of the hammerstone for
any primate species. Chimpanzee meta-tool use is rare (where a chimpanzee uses a third stone to
stabilise an unstable anvil), and has not been reported to have an effect on the dimensions of the
hammerstones used. Similarly, we see no correlation between the dimensions of the hammerstones
used by capuchins at Fazenda Boa Vista and the large stationary anvils used. Wild capuchins at Serra
da Capivara actively manipulate and move anvils, just as the Bossou chimpanzees do, but again we
do not have evidence that hammer choices are affected by that behaviour.

Figure 3.
In the frame showing details of the ridge, what are the meaning of the arrows?
The arrows indicate the directionality of the detachments. This is a common lithic analysis
illustration technique used within archaeology and the study of stone tools. We have clarified this
point in the figure caption.

I find the revised manuscript improved. The relevance of the findings is clearer, and the writing
overall is clearer.
We thank the reviewer for their time, and appreciate that the reviewer approves of the corrections
we have made.
I still find many places where strings of three or more nouns are used as adjectives, or a string of
adjective-noun - noun - adjective- noun, etc. A selection of these are appended in a separate file. In
a few places I indicate wording that I would find easier to understand. Many cases include the use of
a species' name as an adjective. These could easily be altered by using the possessive form of the
species' name. For example, to me, the title would read better as "Analysis of wild macaques' stone
tools used to crack oil palm nuts". Here is another example: early hominin percussive behaviour. Is
it early behavior? This would be clearer as "early hominins' percussive behavior.
We thank the reviewers for their comments on the writing style of the manuscript. We have
changed ‘nut cracking’ to ‘nut-cracking’ throughout to increase clarity.
In addition we have changed the phrase ‘macaque oil palm nut cracking hammerstones’ to
‘hammerstones used by macaques to crack oil palm nuts’, and the phrase ‘extant nonhuman
percussive activity’ to ‘extant nonhuman primates' percussive activity’ as suggested by the reviewer,
and agree that this phrasing is clearer.
Also, sometimes hammerstones are referred to as "pound hammers" or "tools". It would be better if
hammerstones are consistently referred to by one label.
We understand the potential here for slight confusion, however, when using the term ‘tool’ we are
referring to all hammerstones. The terms ‘pound hammer’ and ‘axe hammer’ refer to specific
hammerstone types used by macaques whilst processing gastropods / sea almonds and sessile
oysters. To clarify this, we have altered the text to specifically refer to oil palm hammerstones and
gastropod pound hammers in the results section.
These are all perhaps minor stylistic issues, but I expect that addressing them will make the
manuscript easier for people to read and understand, and thus increase the impact of the work.
