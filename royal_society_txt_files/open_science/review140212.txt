Comments to the Author(s)
The MS by Bespalaya et al. "Reproductive strategies of freshwater bivalves in Arctic ecosystems"
deals with a phenomenon of asynchronous development of the offspring in brooding bivalve
mollusc Pisidum casertanum living in harsh environment of a freezing lake.
While the topic is potentially very interesting, the MS itself has a number of problems.
Among others, the way how the Results are described that is far from satisfactory (with a number
of non-clear places in the text). I am also not happy how the internal logic in the section
Discussion is explained. Few places are redundant, and only part of the available literature on
this topic has been cited. The English should be improved by the native speaker.
Most important, similar facts on this particular species living in the mountain lakes were already
published elsewhere (e.g. Guralnik 2004), and the statements and hypothesis described are not
new.
My detailed comments are given as the side notes in the MS. Generally speaking, it
requires a considerable revision, and firstly, the paper should be carefully rethought in a way
how to present various PRO- and CONTRA- on the ideas under discussion. For instance, in case
of excessive oogenesis, the asynchronous development might be the only way to produce at least
some viable full-size progeny during very short summer.
The original results should be discussed in the light of the massive literature since sphaerids in
general and genus Pisidium in particular are model objects for ecological research for 150 years,
and very well studied. For instance, species from the spaeriid genus Musculium with
asynchronous development live in very harsh conditions too (hot, but not cold), surviving a
summer in the ephemeral dry(!) ponds (Hornbach et al. 1980). Why this obvious similarity was
not used for comparison?
Thus, the MS deserves publication, but it should be extended and restructured to create the
integral picture of the existing knowledge and hypotheses on this topic with incorporation of the
original data. Such work would be the way to make current MS a valuable contribution to this
field.

Dear Authors
Your paper reveals interesting scientific findings about the reproductive tactics of P. casertanum
in the Arctic. Although the science is sound the paper still needs to improve on its structure and
mainly on the English language. I revised the paper using a tracked word document and tried to
help in many sections but it should be carefully revised again by a native English speaker.
Some general comments
Introduction
The final paragraphs of the introduction is a mixture of results and methods, you should discard
those and focus on the premises and aims of the paper instead.
Discussion
Your discussion is very long. You discuss every referenced case independently. Try to be concise
and organize things in paragraphs if the outcome is the same. I did that in one ocasion (Page 9
lines 204-224) but you can check other paragraphs of the discussion.
Specific comments
I did a lot of small corrections in the text. Please check and abbreviate Pisidium to P. except in the
first ocasion of each section.
Looking forward to receive a revised version

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The MS was considerably improved, and became considerably more informative and interesting.
Redundant pieces were deleted.
However, in its current state the MS can not be published yet. Below are my requirements and
suggestions:
(1) Discussion is much more informative, but the section 5.2 still rather chaotic. While most of the
pieces are appropriate, most of them are given without strict consecutive order. There are no
transitions between parts concerning various topics that makes reading very difficult. Plus, an
absence of the quintessence of the paper – discussion why this mollusk has this reproductive
pattern (see above).
(3) Some sentences I don’t understand – please, make them clear.
(4) Before making extrapolations, I ask authors to describe the “coin-flipping hypothesis” and
then apply it to their results. I was totally confused by the last page of the discussion and ask to
give more clear expolanation what means this hypothesis and why the results obtained fit to it.

Dear Author
General comments
Your study is a good contribution for the knowledge on freshwater bivalve reproductive cycle
of the northern edges of distribution.
The paper is, in general, fairly written although it needs an English language revision mainly in
syntax and style. I have also detected some orthographic errors (some of them listed below).
However I think the text is sometimes confusing mainly on the discussion and conclusions; the
main findings are not sufficiently highlighted.
As for the scientific part, in my opinion you do make a nice case about “coin flipping
adaptation” but it is not very clear how do you compare these results with those from lower
latitudes. Furthermore your conclusion should be more clear and concise. Although there
aren’t many studies around brooding strategies of freshwater mollusks “coin flipping
adaptation” is most definitely happening not only in sphaeriids but also on Unionoids where
glochidia sizes are uneven within each cohort, so I think this is a nice study area that should be
pursued.
I would suggest to rebuild the conclusions section to emphasize the major findings of your
study in a very concise manner: i) main features of the life cicle in the Artic population; ii)
what are the main differences with what was previously established mainly at lower latitudes
and iii) Explain why you think that “coin flipping adaptation” is involved, particularly in this
case and iv) what would be relevant for further develop this study

Replay: The analysis of literature data shows that the in northern populations of
freshwater invertebrate the iteroparous behaviour is common feature. In Arctic Lakes,
during the short Arctic Summer, many species of freshwater invertebrates sometimes do
not have time to finish the development and reproduction often happens in the next
year. Many Arctic invertebrates, due to short growing season, show extended
development, and often Arctic populations have life cycles of two or more years.

Total, 139 specimens were gravid. Among them were studied of the 95 individuals
which was formed two brood sacs. The remaining individuals were not studied because
20 individuals had extramarsupial larvae (individuals which have broken free from the

with shell length, at least, 2.2-4.2 mm), the juvenile (the non-gravid individuals with
shell length less than 2.2 mm).
Line 202 - 17.5 from the total or from 51%?
Replay: Agreed, we include the relevant information in MS.
Line 206. How many specimens were measured?
Replay: Agreed, we include the relevant information in MS.
Line 213. of the sample or of 139?
Replay: Agreed, we include the relevant information in MS.
Line 220. These sentences belong to Discussion
Replay: Agreed, we shift these sentences to Discussion
Discussion
Line 234.
It is incorrect to state this. In many instances, reproduction starts befoer the ice break
since algae develop in a water underneath the ice.

Replay: Agreed, we correct this sentence.
Line 243. But why it is "two periods od reproduction"? Please, rewrite.
Replay: Agreed, we rewrite this sentence.
Line 254-259. The same thing is repeated three times in one paragraph. Please, rewrite
in more succint way.
Replay: Agreed, we rewrite this sentence.
Line 275-277. This sentence should be moved further down.
Also, it is not clear WHAT exactly this author meant when wrote about asynchronous
development and possibility for the dispersal
Replay: We agree with the reviewer and rewrite this section.
Line 278. The differences in the data presented should be compared from the point of
view of the environment - while Meier-Brook and Guralnick found embryos of various
sizes in the molluscs from the mountain lakes, Mitropolsky and Heard could work with
the species from the "normal" lakes. Requires checking!
Replay: We agree with the reviewer and rewrite this section in accordantly with
recommendation of reviewer.
Line 295. How your data corroborate to this hypothesis?
Replay: We agree with the reviewer and delete this section.
Line 301-304.
Totally speculative!!!! Where are the data supporting this suggestion? Did you make
experiments?
Replay: We agree with the reviewer and delete this section.
Line 305. It is not "Hence" - this was known before in the literature
Replay: We agree with the reviewer and corrected this sentence.
Line 307-309. How do you know that this occurs? You dealt exclusively with the fixed
material, and it is quite possible that the small embryos are slowly dying in the broken
brood sacs after their larger siblings move to the mantle cavity.
Replay: We agree with the reviewer and deleted this sentence.
10
Line 319-323. This has a sense in good conditions. In your case, the summer is short
and prolonged brooding is senseless.
Replay: We agree with the reviewer and deleted this sentence.
Line 319-323.
What means "variation of reproductive characteristics"? Different size of the released
offspring? The smallest will die in winter, so the asynchronous development might have
sense only if this is a consequence of the competition between embryos to get more
resources and to grow larger thus increasing the chances for survival.
It is totally unclear to me WHAT is the reason for adaptivity? How does this work? I
see the general words, with no explanation.
Replay: We agree with the reviewer and rewrite this sentence.
Conclusions.
Totally non-informative. Delete.
Replay: We agree with the reviewer and rewrite Conclusions.
References.
put the Latin names in italics.
Replay: We agree with the reviewer and corrected Latin names in italics.

Appendix C
Resubmission of Royal Society Open Science manuscript ID RSOS-
140212.R1 "REPRODUCTION OF PISIDIUM CASERTANUM
(POLI, 1791) IN ARCTIC LAKE" by Bespalaya et al.
Dear Emilie Aime, I send for reviewing the manuscript
«REPRODUCTION OF PISIDIUM CASERTANUM (POLI, 1791) IN
ARCTIC LAKE».
I am also attaching a list with answers and explanations of the requests
of reviewer’s. All of the Reviewers comments were attended.
We would like to thank you and the reviewers for all the comments and
suggestions that have helped to improve the overall quality of our manuscript.
I hope that this resubmitted version is acceptable for publication in
your journal. Appended below is the list of changes we have made in response
the referee helpful comments.
Sincerely, Bespalaya Yulia
Reviewer: 1
Your paper reveals interesting scientific findings about the reproductive tactics
of P. casertanum in the Arctic. Although the science is sound the paper still
needs to improve on its structure and mainly on the English language. I revised
the paper using a tracked word document and tried to help in many sections
but it should be carefully revised again by a native English speaker.
Replay: We agree with the reviewer and all of the Reviewer comments were
attended.
The manuscript was corrected for the English language by a native speaker.
Some general comments:
1
Introduction
The final paragraphs of the introduction is a mixture of results and methods,
you should discard those and focus on the premises and aims of the paper
instead.
Replay: We agree with the reviewer and corrected introduction Line 10-26.
Discussion
Your discussion is very long. You discuss every referenced case
independently. Try to be concise and organize things in paragraphs if the
outcome is the same. I did that in one ocasion (Page 9 lines 204-224) but you
can check other paragraphs of the discussion.
Replay: We agree with the reviewer and corrected discussion in accordance
with the recommendations reviewer.
Specific comments
I did a lot of small corrections in the text. Please check and abbreviate
Pisidium to P. except in the first occasion of each section.
Replay: We agree with the reviewer and check and abbreviate Pisidium to P.
Reviewer: 2
The MS was considerably improved, and became considerably more
informative and interesting. Redundant pieces were deleted.
However, in its current state the MS can not be published yet. Below are my
requirements and suggestions:
(1) Discussion is much more informative, but the section 5.2 still rather
chaotic. While most of the pieces are appropriate, most of them are given
without strict consecutive order. There are no transitions between parts
concerning various topics that makes reading very difficult. Plus, an absence
of the quintessence of the paper – discussion why this mollusk has this
reproductive pattern (see above).
Replay: We agree with the reviewer and corrected discussion in accordance
with the recommendations of reviewer.
2
Some sentences I don’t understand – please, make them clear.
Replay: We rewrite sentences in accordance with the recommendations of
reviewer.
(4) Before making extrapolations, I ask authors to describe the “coin-flipping
hypothesis” and then apply it to their results. I was totally confused by the last
page of the discussion and ask to give more clear explanation what means this
hypothesis and why the results obtained fit to it.
Replay: We rewrite the “coin-flipping hypothesis” and then apply it to our
results.
