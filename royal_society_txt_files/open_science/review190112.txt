In this work, X-ray CT is used to continuously monitor the dynamic process of water transport in
mortar and concrete; meanwhile, the amount of water absorption is also measured by the
gravimetric method. It is interesting that the relationship between the capillary coefficient and
sorptivity is established based on theory analysis and experiment results. However, this paper
should be revised before accepting. Some comments for revising are as follows:
(1) Two important references about the transport properties of cement-based materials are
advised to cite in this paper.

(2) Page 16: Table 3, the units are not given.
(3) The porosity of sample measured by the method of water absorption only includes open
pores, how about the effect of closed pores on the water absorption?
(4) In this model, S/k=f, the porosity (f) is measured by vacuum water-saturated method,
why? Can it be measured by others (e.g., MIP)? This should be paid more attention.

This is a very interesting work to propose a simple model to quantify the relationship between
porosity, sorptivity and capillary coefficient. Both theoretical and experimental works are
conducted to support the hypothesis. Overall, this paper is well written and can be accepted after
revising the following:
Abstract: It is debatable to state that all durability performances of cement-based materials
depend on water absorption. For example, chloride can diffuse into concrete, which is governed,
by both concrete quality and concentration difference.

to their durability. The amount of absorbed water and transport depth are usually used to describe
the property of water absorption, however, their relationship is not clear. This work offers a
technique of X-ray CT combined with CsCl enhancing to continuously monitor the dynamic process
of water uptake in cement-based materials and measures the amount of water absorption by the
gravimetric method, in further, the relationship between the capillary coefficient and sorptivity is
established based on theory analysis and experiment results. It is an interesting and significant
research work in this area, which can be published in this journal after a minor revision. Some
suggestions are as follows:
(1) Why the total amount of chemical compositions in cement is not 100%?
(2) The unit for mix proportions of mortar and concrete shown in Table 3 is not given.

Reviewers’ Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Water absorption is an important property to the cement-based materials,
which is directly related to their durability. The amount of absorbed water and
transport depth are usually used to describe the property of water absorption,
however, their relationship is not clear. This work offers a technique of X-ray CT
combined with CsCl enhancing to continuously monitor the dynamic process of
water uptake in cement-based materials and measures the amount of water
absorption by the gravimetric method, in further, the relationship between the
capillary coefficient and sorptivity is established based on theory analysis and
experiment results. It is an interesting and significant research work in this area,
which can be published in this journal after a minor revision. Some suggestions
are as follows:
(1) Why the total amount of chemical compositions in cement is not 100%?
Response: More chemical compositions with lower content were not shown in the
table. Table 2 has been revised.
(2) The unit for mix proportions of mortar and concrete shown in Table 3 is
not given.
Response: The unit “(wt%)” is added in Table 3.
(3) “.” should be added after “in this work”.
Response: “.” has been added in the text.
(4) The porosity of sample was measured using vacuum water-saturated
method, why not MIP? In addition, the porosities of mortar and concrete
measured by vacuum water-saturated method are higher than that calculated
from equation (19), they are different from each other.
Response: Vacuum water-saturated is a simple method to measure the porosity of
porous materials, which can be operated easily. However, MIP is a special method to
obtain the porosity of material, which is expensive and harmful to people. What’s
more, an applied pressure (>200 MPa) is necessary for MIP, which certainly destroy
actual pore structure of material. Then, the porosity measured by MIP is not the actual
porosity of material.
Although the porosities of mortar and concrete measured by vacuum water-saturated
method are higher than that calculated from equation (19), the maximum difference is
merely 6.6%. Then, the authors describe that “the results obtained from two different
methods are close to each other.”
Reviewer: 2
In this work, X-ray CT is used to continuously monitor the dynamic process
of water transport in mortar and concrete; meanwhile, the amount of water
absorption is also measured by the gravimetric method. It is interesting that the
relationship between the capillary coefficient and sorptivity is established based
on theory analysis and experiment results. However, this paper should be revised
before accepting. Some comments for revising are as follows:
(1) Two important references about the transport properties of
cement-based materials are advised to cite in this paper.
Hou, D., Li, T., & Wang, P. (2018). ACS Sustainable Chemistry &
Engineering, 6(7), 9498-9509.
Hou, D., Zhao, T., Ma, H., & Li, Z. (2015). The Journal of Physical
Chemistry C, 119(3), 1346-1358.
Response: These two references have been cited in this paper.
(2) Page 16: Table 3, the units are not given.
Response: The unit “(wt%)” is added in Table 3.
(3) The porosity of sample measured by the method of water absorption only
includes open pores, how about the effect of closed pores on the water
absorption?
Response: In fact, water absorption and ions transport are mainly affected by the
open pores of material, and then the effect of closed pores on water absorption is not
considered.
(4) In this model, S/k=f, the porosity (f) is measured by vacuum
water-saturated method, why? Can it be measured by others (e.g., MIP)? This
should be paid more attention.
Response: It is easy to measure the porosity of porous materials using vacuum
water-saturated method, besides, which is the actual porosity. Usually, the porosity
also can be measured by MIP, nitrogen adsorption, imaging method and so on.
However, these methods have their own shortcoming. MIP is a special method to
obtain the porosity of material, which is expensive and harmful to people. What’s
more, an applied pressure (>200 MPa) is necessary for MIP, which certainly destroy
actual pore structure of material. Then, the porosity measured by MIP is not the actual
porosity of material. Nitrogen adsorption is not suitable for the measurement of pore
with the diameter >50nm. The imaging method cannot be used to characterize the
micro-scale pores due to its lower resolution of image. Then, the porosity measured
by nitrogen adsorption and imaging method is lower than the actual porosity of
material. In this model, S/k=f, the porosity (f) is measured by vacuum
water-saturated method.
Reviewer: 3
The durability of cement-based materials is a critical property during their
total service life and water absorption can directly reflect it. Then, the researcher
and engineer usually measure the water absorption to predict their long time
performance. In this work, X-ray CT and the gravimetric method were used
together to describe water absorption of mortar and concrete; what’s more, the
relationship between the capillary coefficient and sorptivity was established
based on theory analysis and experiment. It offers a model for the determination
of capillary coefficient in accordance with the measurement of sorptivity. This
paper can be accepted in this journal after a minor revision. However, some
improvements should be done:
1. Water absorption was measured by X-ray CT and the gravimetric method
in this work, if the temperature for these tests are the same?
Response: The temperature for water absorption measured by X-ray CT and the
gravimetric method was controlled at 20±1°C.
2. The hydration of cement is a long time process, if the second hydration is
considered during the process of water absorption?
Response: In this work, the curing time of sample was increased up to 60 days to
reduce the effect of second hydration on water absorption.
3. In Fig.3, some bright spots that appear above the fluid penetration area,
what are they?
Response: The bright spots that appear above the fluid penetration are the sand with
bigger size, whose density is higher than the paste, and then they are bright in the

4. The reviewer think that only capillary pores are considered in this work,
how about gel pores in C-S-H?
Response: The process of water absorption can be divided into two stages: rapid
absorption and steady absorption. In the period of rapid absorption, water uptake in
sample through the capillary pores and this stage is mainly controlled by capillary
pores. In the period of steady absorption, water continues to transport into gel pores
and it is mainly controlled by the mechanism of diffusion. Gel pores in C-S-H is less
than 10 nm and the volume fraction is usually less than 10%, then the effect of gel
pores on water absorption is usually not considered.
5. Please check the language again.
Response: The authors have revised the manuscript with the help of specialist.
Finally, we thank the reviewers very much for giving us such good suggestions to
improve our manuscript. We also thank the editor very much for your time and effort
to publish this paper.
Sincerely yours,
