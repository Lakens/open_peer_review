There are few points to concern:
• The authors claimed that this study could use in biomedical applications in the
introduction part, however, the cell cytotoxicity and cell viability haven’t been performed.
• The authors mentioned in Mechanical Testing (Results and Discussions part) that “silver
loading dramatically increased the ultimate stress and slightly reduced strain at break”. And the
last sentence in this section was “it can be concluded that silver chloride can be used to impart
biocidal function to the PCL membranes with improved mechanical properties”. Without
statistical analysis, how could the authors confirm the significant difference between the samples?
Could the authors describe the number of samples for tensile strength testing and add the errors
bar to the bar chart for Figure 4b?

Comments to the Author:
This is an interesting paper and the authors have addressed most of the comments form the
referees with the exception of EDX and statistical analysis. Further characterisation of the
materials should be provided - if EDX isn't available perhaps another technique such as XRD. Did
UV/Vis show anything? The paper also needs a careful read though to correct grammatical
errors.

brication and Characterization of Electrospun PCL Fibrous Membrane with
tibacterial Functionality
mmary
manuscript is well written reporting the electrospinning of poly (e-caprolactone) nanofibers
taining Silver chloride particles for antibacterial applications. In addition, the authors have
died some of the thermomechanical and morphological outcomes of the silver chloride PCL
ofibers. Electrospun PCL nanofibers containing Silver chloride particles, similar to other
itives, showed no changes in melting patterns, while due to presumably nucleating effect of
ver chloride particles, changes in crystallization patterns were observed, indicating
ractions between the PCL and silver chloride particles. Furthermore, the authors observed the
uence of loaded silver chloride particles on morphology of nanofibers with larger loading of
ver chloride resulting in beaded structure. Moreover, presence of Silver chloride resulted in
arkable antibacterial functionalities as shown by resistance to S.aureus and E.coli 0157:H7,
le no such effect was seen for neat PCL nanofibers.
commendation: This reviewer is of the view that the report can be accepted with major
ision (mostly writing part).
neral comments: The authors attempt to fabricate electrospun PCL nanofibers containing
ying loading of silver chloride particles using chloroform/methanol solvent system. Several
dies have shown poor conductivity of PCL, similar to other low-conductive polymers, to have
ajor impact in their electrospinning. One way to overcome this drawback is to have a co-
vent with higher conductivity. However, commonly used co-solvents such as chloroform,
hloromethane, tetrahydrofuran commonly used for this purpose have poor conductivity as
l, thus complicating the electrospinning process. Hence, electrospinning of PCL is typically
ried from a binary solvent mixture containing a non-solvent, for example, DMF, that has
her conductivity (DOI: dx.doi.org/10.1021/bm501158w), (DOI: 10.1002/app.42782),
OI:10.1016/j.polymer.2015.08.045) But addition of co-solvents (for instance, DMF) causes
iculty in their removal as they have a high boiling points. However, a recent study showed
possibility of electrospinning PCL from a single solvent (chloroform) with addition of salts
can be easily removed after the completion of electrospinning
OI: 10.1021/acs.biomac.5b01379). But this methodology has several drawbacks as well with
t and foremost being that DMF has a higher boiling point. If the salt system is used instead,
r remnants in the nanofibers might cause toxicity.
ce several strategies exists to overcome the difficulties in electrospinning PCL, advantages of
osing the chloroform/methanol needs to be specifically mentioned. Also, as the authors report
the nanofibers containing silver chloride particles have a beaded structure, is that due to the
r electrical conductivity of the solvent systems used? A good discussion along the solvent
tem by utilizing these examples would be great and provide a strong follow up work.
th regards to the thermal analyses (DSC and TGA), the authors performed analyses on all the
tinent samples, but did not elaborate much on why the addition of AgCl particles caused
leating effects on the PCL? In these two references (DOI: dx.doi.org/10.1021/bm501158w),
OI: 10.1002/app.42782), the authors studied addition of cyclodextrins and their subsequent
cts on the crystallinity, crystallizability of PCL nanofibers. Possibly would be helpful to this
dy for improving the discussion.
ewise, the discussion part on the mechanical properties is far too inadequate. In addition, as
authors intend to study the mechanical properties of presumably nucleated PCL nanofibers
h the addition of AgCl particles, the intermolecular interaction between the two molecules
ld be at play. As this reviewer sees a trend in increased modulus and strength with decreased
ngation, this reference (DOI:10.1016/j.polymer.2015.08.045) could be of help to understand
discuss the intermolecular interaction of the nucleants (in this case, AgCl) with the polymer
rix.
cific comments:
roduction:
Please remove second paragraph third line (PCL offers potential for tissue engineering of
e, cartilage and scaffolds which have been manufactured using a variety of techniques
uding fused). It is redundant information and is not applicable to study as the authors are not
cussing orthopaedic tissues.
hroughout the manuscript change the term “ÐCS” to “DSC”.
n this section provide some examples of PCL nanofibers containing Silver based materials for
cidal applications. The readers would then be able to appreciate the essence of this great
rk.
