It is important to study the advances on compact B4C ceramics, which obtained by liquid-phase
pressureless sintering method with different amounts of GPL. In this work, the authors are
investigating the effects of GPL, including hardness, bending strength, fracture toughness,
thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. However, there are several issues need to be
addressed before being published:
Typo:
1. Page 5, line 24, the word “conculsion” should be “conclusion”.

Questions:
1. In Fig. 1, what’s the magnification for these pictures of microstructures? Please specify the
magnification for each picture from (a) to (d) because the scale bar is different in these pictures.
2. In Fig. 2, what’s magnification for these pictures of B4C ceramics samples? Please specify the
magnification for each picture from (a) to (d) because the scale bar is different in these pictures
and be careful when compare the feature size of these samples.
3. Please label where the GPL is also in Fig. 1. (d)
4. Please explain the reasons why when GPL (wt%) larger than 0.8 and the electrical resistivity is
increasing?
5. In this paper, for the specimen with 1.2 wt% GPL addition the value of thermal conductivity
decreased can be attributed to the increase of nonfunctional-GPL. Any evidence of the existence
of these nonfunctional-GPL? And why with higher wt% of GPL will increase the nonfunctional-
GPL?
6. Please give some possible applications which can apply these compact B4C ceramics with GPL.

Appendix A
Dear editor,
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewer’s insightful comments concerning
our manuscript entitled “Graphene platelets enhanced pressureless-sintered B4C
ceramics” (Manuscript ID: RSOS-171837). According to the comments and
suggestions, we have revised the manuscript carefully and thoroughly. The main
corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s comments are as
following:
1. Response to comments of Reviewer: 1
Thank the reviewer for the precious comment. What we are done still leaves
much to be desired. Because for pressureless sintered B4C ceramics, effects of GPL
on the integrated performance of B4C, and the actions between GPL and pores were
seldom studied. There is not enough information to be compared. So we have to come
to a conclusion based on the blank experiments. And we are very sorry for the
mistakes in the references. We have corrected the mistakes and checked the whole
manuscript immediately.
2. Response to comments of Reviewer: 2
Thank the reviewer for the precious comment. We are very sorry for the spelling
mistakes in the manuscript. We have corrected the mistakes and checked the whole
manuscript.
(1) Response to question 1: In Fig. 1, what’s the magnification for these pictures
of microstructures? Please specify the magnification for each picture from (a) to (d)
because the scale bar is different in these pictures.
Response : The magnification of a, c and b, d in Fig. 1 is 4000, 3000 respectively.
We rewrote the legend of Fig. 1 with preccise magnification.
(2) Response to question 2 : In Fig. 2, what’s magnification for these pictures of
B4C ceramics samples?
Response : The magnification of a, c and b, d in Fig. 2 is 10000, 20000
respectively. We rewrote the legend of Fig. 2 with preccise magnification.
(3) Response to question 3 : Please label where the GPL is also in Fig. 1. (d).
Response : the exist of GPL in Fig. 1. (d) was marked in the re-edited Fig. 1.
(4) Response to question 4 : Please explain the reasons why when GPL (wt%)
larger than 0.8 and the electrical resistivity is increasing?
Response : The electrical resistivity of samples shows the change of its structure.
We hold that GPL is conducive to weakening the electrical resistivity, but the
existence of nonfunctional-GPL structure and increased pores have the opposite effect.
When GPL larger than 0.8 wt%, increased nonfunctional-GPL structure and pores
play a more important role, these sructure will hinder the delivery of electron,
showing a increased electrical resistivity.
And we modified the related description in the second paragraph of Section 3.3.
“This is because that GPL is conducive to enhancing thermal conductivity and
weakening the electrical resistivity, but the existence of nonfunctional-GPL structure
and increased pores have the opposite effect, when GPL larger than 0.8 wt%,
increased nonfunctional-GPL structure and pores play a more important role.
Furthermore, delivery of electron and vibrations in the lattice are constrained by these
defects.”
(5) Response to question 5 : In this paper, for the specimen with 1.2 wt% GPL
addition the value of thermal conductivity decreased can be attributed to the increase
of nonfunctional-GPL. Any evidence of the existence of these nonfunctional-GPL?
And why with higher wt% of GPL will increase the nonfunctional-GPL?
Response : We regared the isolated GPL and the GPL conbined with pores as the
nonfunctional-GPL. The bonding strength of nonfunctional-GPL and basement is very
low, so the formation of nonfunctional-GPL is detrimental to the improvement of any
performance. The GPL marked in Fig. 1. (d) and Fig. 2. (a) can be seen as
nonfunctional-GPL.
The generation of nonfunctional-GPL mainly results from the process of liquid
phase transfer. When the content of GPL increased, it is harder for excessive GPL to
be dispersed uniformly, so the GPL has higher chance to conbined with pores and thus
nonfunctional-GPL formed.
So we have modified the expression of the generation of nonfunctional-GPL in
the second half of Section 3.1.“When the content rise to 1.0 wt%, it is harder for
excessive GPL to be dispersed uniformly, so the GPL has higher chance to conbined
with pores and thus nonfunctional-GPL formed.”
(6) Response to question 6 : Please give some possible applications which can
apply these compact B4C ceramics with GPL.
Response : B4C ceramics are widely utilized as nozzles and sharpeners, the
enhanced mechanical properties and thermal properties will extend service life of
these components; the enhanced electrical properties may makes B4C-GPL composite
ceramics processed by wire cutting machine easily.
Besides, we have added Laiwu yasai ceramics technology Co. Ltd. as a
cooperation to show our appreciation for their help.
The Reviewer’s comments are quiet helpful and we have tried our best to
improve the manuscript and made some changes in the manuscript. Thank you again
for your kind help and we hope that the correction will meet with approval.
Thank you very much and best regards.
Sincerely yours,
Dezhi Gao
