This paper explores a very interesting toping for skipping, which was always mentioned but
never studied so deeply: its stability. I really appreciated also the comparison with the animal
world. I have only minor comments and suggestions to the authors that could potentially
improve the paper.
Page 3, lines 10-12: I think that trail leg is the rear leg, here it is the opposite.
Page 5, lines 59-60: Here you mentioned "g" as a model parameter. However you do not present
any data. Have you run some simulation varying "g"? Recently Ackermann and Van den Bogert
(2012) and Pavei et al. 2015 (Journal of Applied Physiology) put their attention on skipping as the
gait of choice in hypogravity and this different simulation could give new evidence.
Page 6, lines 23-24: E is metabolic energy? How do you decide the limits?
Page 9, lines 41-46: skipping on uneven terrain has never been tested, however based on
kinematic chances of the other gaits could you expect that a subject would skip with retracted
legs?
Page 12, lines 12-14: it should also be noted that, especially the leading, legs bend the knee during
support phase
Page 12, lines 37-39: Recently Pavei et al. 2015 suggested that balance (stability) could have been a
mechanical trigger for the choice of skipping on the moon. It seems that your data support this
suggestion and it could be added to this section, since skipping is also an hypo-gravity gait.

The authors present experimental data collection and modeling analysis exploring the stability of
unilateral skipping gaits in bipedal locomotion. Experimental data is used to attain gait
parameters for the BSLIP model, which is used to conduct a gait stability analysis. The results are
an interesting piece of evidence in the larger conversation over the role of stability and energy
economy in gait selection and locomotion in general.
The study design is clean and straightforward (and well-written). Experimentation with human
subjects provides BSLIP model parameters, and the authors perform a stability/robustness
analysis on the BSLIP model. The details of the methods appear well-chosen and numerical
methods appear solid. I would like to see the numerical integration method listed in some
fashion (prior experience would lead me to expect the use of MATLAB's ode45, and if so, perhaps
list the integration tolerances). Further, the minimalist assumptions regarding the stiffness
modulations are well-motivated, thoughtfully limiting the number of parameters to iterate.
The wide range of stability is an interesting find, especially when similar analyses of walking,
running, and grounded running yield significantly narrower ranges. To me, this is the key
finding of the study and can stand as an established property of skipping gaits. Based on this
work, I would be comfortable saying to colleagues "according to theoretical models, skipping is
actually a very stable gait over a wide range of speeds." This provides a plausible explanation for
the existence of skipping gaits in nature and adds nuance to the "stability vs. economy" question.
One point I would like to see clarified are the implications regarding cost of transport.
Specifically, the authors infer from their modeling various effects on locomotion economy.
From P8L22. "Asymmetry in leg stiffness has considerable influence on the cost of transport
(energy/dist. traveled)..."
From P10L47. "... but at the cost of larger asymmetries in leg forces, and hence less economic
locomotion."
The flow of the manuscript is generally quite clear and logical, but I don't follow the reasoning
regarding transport costs. The pedant in me knows that this model is energetically conservative,
and thus fundamentally has no "energy costs" regardless of speed; but I'm sure the authors have a
deeper logic in mind. It seems the authors are correlating distance traveled at a given energy
level with transport economy: "... it diminishes the cost of transport (with the same energy the
model travels long distances see fig. 3 A, B)." Is this an established indicator of transport
economy as seen in actual organisms? If it is, I would like to see it cited after one of these
statements. To me, it's not obvious that distance traveled per step per unit gait energy necessarily
correlates with COT. This assumes that metabolic/mechanical cost (per step) necessarily
correlates with overall gait energy. As a counterexample, I might hypothesize that energy costs
correlate with the magnitude of energy cycled in and out of the BSLIP spring (correlating with
thermodynamic losses of energy conversion). So, in short, I'd like to either see these claims better
supported in the manuscript or rephrased.
4
Building off this previous point, I can see the appeal of claiming a tradeoff between speed and
energy economy with trailing-leg stiffness. However, the authors make it clear that the literature
already establishes the exacerbated energy costs of skipping, which I think is the key tradeoff
being addressed in this manuscript. If they want to make claims about this trailing-leg stiffness
tradeoff, I feel the aforementioned cost-of-transport inference should be better established or
supplemented with further analysis aimed more directly at assessing energy costs.
Further, I would appreciate a specific citation correlating exacerbated asymmetry with higher
energy costs (not an unreasonable claim to be sure - I would just like more specific support).
As a side note, the authors (justifiably) cite instances of animals routinely skipping (e.g. jerboas
and crows). Because the modeling parameters are derived from human experiments, I feel that
the study's implications are inherently limited to human locomotion. This might merit inclusion
in the title (e.g. "Stability in human skipping gaits"). Perhaps the authors could qualitatively
compare the stiffnesses of human skipping to data reported in the "small avian locomotion"
paper, giving the audience a better sense of how applicable these simulation results are to other
biological skippers. This is an important distinction because the paper is driving at the greater
role of stability and economy in locomotion ("the use of skipping again indicates the existence of
a trade-off between stability and economy of locomotion"). Making the case for the existence of
this tradeoff is important, as is clarifying the scope of these results in relation to that goal.

This paper deepens the understanding of the mechanics/kinematics of unilateral skipping by
using optimised models for cycle stability and perturbation robustness. The application of the
presented results ranges from human to animals and even to low gravity adaptation of bipedal
locomotion.

Also, most of the findings confirms previous knowledge and speculations based on inspection,
experiments and other modellistic work, and opens to focussed new investigations on a gait that
is likely a remnant of quadrupedal gallop for bipeds.
General Comments
The term ‘stability’ should be better explained, as its meaning is different in modelling and in
biomechanics/othopaedics of locomotion.
I could not open the .qtm files from Apple QuickTime software.

e: We measured locomotion speed during skipping from the horizontal motion of a marker
at L5 (rough estimate of the position of the CoM). We use only one forceplate in our setup.

damentally has no "energy costs" regardless of speed; but I'm sure the authors have a

that distance traveled per step per unit gait energy necessarily correlates with COT. This
that metabolic/mechanical cost (per step) necessarily correlates with overall gait energy. As
rexample, I might hypothesize that energy costs correlate with the magnitude of energy

travelled. However, our simulations show that there are combinations of parameters, which
