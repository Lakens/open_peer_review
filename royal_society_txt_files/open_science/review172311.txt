This paper describes the total synthesis and the characterization of the microperoxidase. The
authors succeeded in preparation of the totally synthetic microperoxidase by incorporating haem
C into the undecamer peptide by the thiol-ene click reaction. They characterized the peptide in
detail by spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements along with high speed AFM
measurements, and demonstrated that the peptide has the almost identical properties to its
naturally occurring counterpart. The obtained data and their interpretations are considered to be
scientifically sound. The microperoxidases have been used as models for the oxidoreductase
reaction mechanisms and as platforms for various biosensing systems. Thus, this paper could
provide useful information to those engaging in the relevant fields. Therefore, this paper is
recommended for publication in this journal. However, the following points should be addressed
to improve the quality of the paper.
1. The authors should explain the purpose of the experiments using the mutants (NAcMPm)
more clearly. The enzymatic activity of NAcMPm was very low compared with the natural MP-
11. Is this an expected result or not? They should describe the design concept of NAcMPm in
more detail.
2. The 3D model of the peptide shown in Figure 1 is not clear; it is not easy to identify the amino
acids in this model. The abbreviations of amino acids should be denoted in the model or another
model shown in different representation such as ball-and-stick model should be also displayed.
3. In Figure S9, there is no explanation about colors (red and black) of lines.
4. In Figure 2, the label “c” is missing.

In this paper, the authors describe their efforts to synthesize microperoxidase-11 (MP-11) and to
compare its physical, electrochemical, spectroscopic, and catalytic properties with authentic MP-
11 obtained from the degradation of cytochrome c. This is a worthy objective since synthetic
control would provide investigators the ability to readily mutate the undecapeptide attached to
the heme group in future studies. In fact, the authors present one successful example of such a
mutation. There are interesting results presented and a fair bit to like about this paper.
Unfortunately, there are a few outstanding issues and a need for more critical editing and
polishing.
PEROXIDASE ACTIVITY (section 3.2).
Because the synthetic sample (NAcMP) only exhibits 27% of the activity of authentic MP-11, how
confident can one be that these are same species (and an earlier study resulted in 43% of natural
activity)? The proposal that slight changes to a pocket-like structure might account for these
differences is not convincing. The picket-fence argument is based on a static calculated structure,
not free molecules in water.
It seems possible, if not probable, that the differences are due to different mixtures of products.
The implicit assumption is made that only one product (identical to MP-11) results from
reconstitution of the undecapeptide with hemin. However, if one cysteine reacted initially with
the wrong vinyl group, a different isomer will result that has either reversed thioether bonds or
only one thioether bond. Furthermore, cysteine is a ligand for iron, which could lead to
additional isomers. In Figure S2, the chromatogram shows a number of peaks, so it appears to be
a complex mixture. It would be helpful to see a chromatogram of authentic MP-11 itself. The text
accompanying Figure S2 furthermore states that peaks were collected between 12.5 and 17.5
minutes, but there are no peaks apparent in this time range.
SPECTROELECTROCHEMISTRY AND ELECTROCATALYSIS (sections 3.3 and 3.4)
Figures S9 and Figure 5 show quite different CVs for what should be the same experiment.
Reverse peaks in one case but not in the other.
Negative formal potential shifts (vs cytochrome c) for microperoxidases result, in part, from
aqueous exposure of the heme, which stabilizes the ferric form relative to the ferrous. Also, the
axial bonding is different. Harry Gray’s group has addressed the redox properties of
microperoxidases.
Table 2. According to the mechanism, which seems valid, the presence of H2O2 should have no
effect on the formal potential of equation (6) whereas the table shows a major shift.
Results are also presented without any statistics such as standard deviation.

Title: Totally Synthetic Microperoxidase-11
Authors: Junichi Tanabe, Koji Nakano,* Ryutaro Hirata, Toshiki Himeno, Ryoichi Ishimatsu,
Toshihiko Imato, Hirotaka Okabe, Naoki Matsuda
We sincerely thank the reviewers for constructive criticisms and valuable comments; they were
of great help in revising the manuscript. Accordingly, we revised the manuscript with additional
data and interpretations both of which should systematically improve the quality of the paper. Our
responses to the referee’s comments are given below.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This paper describes the total synthesis and the characterization of the
microperoxidase. The authors succeeded in preparation of the totally synthetic
microperoxidase by incorporating haem C into the undecamer peptide by the thiol-ene
click reaction. They characterized the peptide in detail by spectroscopic and
electrochemical measurements along with high speed AFM measurements, and
demonstrated that the peptide has the almost identical properties to its naturally
occurring counterpart. The obtained data and their interpretations are considered to be
scientifically sound. The microperoxidases have been used as models for the
oxidoreductase reaction mechanisms and as platforms for various biosensing systems.
Thus, this paper could provide useful information to those engaging in the relevant
fields. Therefore, this paper is recommended for publication in this journal. However,
the following points should be addressed to improve the quality of the paper.
1. The authors should explain the purpose of the experiments using the mutants
(NAcMPm) more clearly. The enzymatic activity of NAcMPm was very low compared
with the natural MP-11. Is this an expected result or not? They should describe the
design concept of NAcMPm in more detail.
Answer: First of all, we are appreciating that the reviewer favourably evaluated our
achievements.
Now, the paper describes total chemical synthesis of MP-11, which is followed by
functional modification through artificial mutation. In designing a mutant undecapeptide,
we focused on the structure of cytochrome c, which is the primary source of MP-11.
Namely, mitochondrial cytochromes c contains a c-type heme with axial His18 and Met80
ligands and therefore, we replace His8 in MP-11 to Met8. Additionally, cytochromes c
become able to act as peroxidases upon losing the Met80 ligation through structural
1
deformations, typically denaturation. Therefore, NAcMPm could be regarded as a negative
control sample of NAcMP. Although the activity was remained at a low value, the result
will be important to understand the molecular mechanism that develops the peroxidase
function in terms of the axial coordination of haem-Fe. Based on this consideration, we
revised the corresponding part in the text as follows.
(p 4, l 5) On the other hand, we expanded early research21 by synthesizing an example
of mutant, VQKCAQCMTVE (H8M); mitochondrial cytochromes c contains a c-type
heme with axial His18 and Met80 ligands and therefore, after reconstitution H8M
represents a homologous MP-11 having the opposite axial ligand other than His. On the
other hand, …
(p 8, l 6) On the one hand, class I cytochromes c (His/Met coordination) exert
peroxidase activity when the haem-Fe loses Met80-coordination.29 In the “push-pull”
mechanism, the histidine-ligated structure has been considered to play the key role in
peroxidase reactions.27 The activity of NAcMPm was found to be considerably low
comparing with NAcMP, which could endorse the proposed theory. On the other hand,
class I cytochromes c (His/Met coordination) shows…
2. The 3D model of the peptide shown in Figure 1 is not clear; it is not easy to identify
the amino acids in this model. The abbreviations of amino acids should be denoted in
the model or another model shown in different representation such as ball-and-stick
model should be also displayed.
Answer: We replaced the 3D model with an improved one whose amino acids are labelled
by the corresponding 3-letter abbreviations. The haem was also labelled to make the
structure easier to understand.
3. In Figure S9, there is no explanation about colours (red and black) of lines.
Answer: We appreciate reviewer's careful reviewing. We revised the figure caption with
additional descriptions (red colour) as given below.

haempeptides were given as the black lines. Each inset shows the scan-rate dependence of
the magnitude of reduction peak current.

Comments to the Author(s)
In this paper, the authors describe their efforts to synthesize microperoxidase-11 (MP-
11) and to compare its physical, electrochemical, spectroscopic, and catalytic
properties with authentic MP-11 obtained from the degradation of cytochrome c. This is
a worthy objective since synthetic control would provide investigators the ability to
readily mutate the undecapeptide attached to the heme group in future studies. In fact,
the authors present one successful example of such a mutation. There are interesting
results presented and a fair bit to like about this paper. Unfortunately, there are a few
outstanding issues and a need for more critical editing and polishing.
PEROXIDASE ACTIVITY (section 3.2).
Because the synthetic sample (NAcMP) only exhibits 27% of the activity of authentic
MP-11, how confident can one be that these are same species (and an earlier study
resulted in 43% of natural activity)? The proposal that slight changes to a pocket-like
structure might account for these differences is not convincing. The picket-fence
argument is based on a static calculated structure, not free molecules in water.
Answer: First of all, we are appreciating that the reviewer favourably evaluated our
achievements and thank for reviewer’s helpful comments.
Now, this comment is closely related to the structure of NAcMP, which is pointed out
in the comment below so we will discuss it together in the next section.
It seems possible, if not probable, that the differences are due to different mixtures of
products. The implicit assumption is made that only one product (identical to MP-11)
results from reconstitution of the undecapeptide with hemin. However, if one cysteine
reacted initially with the wrong vinyl group, a different isomer will result that has either
reversed thioether bonds or only one thioether bond. Furthermore, cysteine is a ligand
for iron, which could lead to additional isomers. In Figure S2, the chromatogram shows
a number of peaks, so it appears to be a complex mixture. It would be helpful to see a
chromatogram of authentic MP-11 itself. The text accompanying Figure S2 furthermore
states that peaks were collected between 12.5 and 17.5 minutes, but there are no
peaks apparent in this time range.
Answer: We surveyed related literatures again and noticed a report from Professor Gray’s
group: Low D. M., Gray H. B., Duus J. Ø. 1997 Paramagnetic NMR Spectroscopy of
Microperoxidase-8. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 119, 1—5. (DOI: 10.1021/ja962948s). They examined
a low-spin ferric-cyanide derivative of MP-8 by using 1H and 13C NMR and reasonably
explained the structure including the two thioether bonds between the cysteines and the haem.
Yet, as pointed out by the reviewer, the possibility of the presence of isomers is not solved; each
sulfhydryl group in the peptide chain must preferentially bind with the vinyl group, either 2- or
4-position of haem. We need to do such experiments with our system, too. Unfortunately, we
do not have expertise of advanced NMR analysis using various correlation techniques. In
addition, NMR measurements generally require a large amount of sample. With these reasons,
3
we cannot do the experiment immediately and therefore, we would like to make it a task in the
near future.
Regarding axial-ligation of the thiolate function of cysteine to the haem-Fe, on the other
hand, we think that the final compound does not contain the particular coordination structure;
unlike most cytochromes c, only cytochromes P450 that involve the haem Fe-thiolate bond,
showed an absorption maximum at 450 nm whereas similarly with natural MP-11, both
NAcMP and NAcMPm are characterized by an absorption maximum at around 400 nm.
Next, as suggested by the reviewer, we added a chromatogram obtained for natural MP-11
(Figure S2 inset). One can see that natural MP-11 shows a broad peak when analysed on a
C18-column. NAcMP and also NAcMPm showed similar tendency and so, we collected the
highlighted fractions. Although they do not exhibit peak-shaped profile, they clearly show UV-
vis absorption at 280 nm (peptide) as well as at 408 (hemin). We identified the fractions of the
photoinitiator and hemin alone and labelled them, too. Lastly, the multiple components found
between 18.5—24 min were supposed to be by-products from the photoinitiator.
In summary, we explained, in the original manuscript, the lower activity of NAcMP as
well as the batch-to-batch variation from the viewpoint of the conformational difference of
the polypeptide chain including the amino-acid residues. However, NAcMP has not yet been
characterized by NMR to confirm the exact primary structure around heme. So, we accept the
reviewer's criticism and revised the text accordingly. They are given below.
(p 7, l 22) Additionally, we obtained somewhat higher activity (43% against natural MP-11)
in the previous report.21 In the case of horse radish peroxidase, a ring of three peripheral
phenylalanine residues guard the entrance to exposed haem edge, which is responsible of
substrate binding.28 From the 3D model (Figure 1), one can find that the N-terminal amino acids
(VQK) with bulky resides develop a picket-fence structure. The pocket-like arrangement could
collaborate with the haem in guest recognition/binding. Therefore, it was considered that any
trivial difference in the spatial arrangement appeared as a difference in the reaction rate. haem
plane without an axial ligand is open toward the outside and the guest molecule can easily
approach the active site to be involved in the catalytic reaction. Accordingly, we can expect that
the catalytic activity depends on the primary structure in the vicinity of haem. Since the thiol-
ene click reaction does not have any preference in reacting with the vinyl group, either 2- or 4-
position of haem, the final compound may consist of several structural isomers. Previously,
Gray et al examined a low-spin ferric-cyanide derivative of MP-8 by using 1H and 13C NMR
and reasonably explained the structure including the thioether bonds.28 The primary structure
of NAcMP must be examined similarly in the future for the detailed discussion of specific
activity.
SPECTROELECTROCHEMISTRY AND ELECTROCATALYSIS (sections 3.3 and 3.4)
Figures S9 and Figure 5 show quite different CVs for what should be the same
experiment. Reverse peaks in one case but not in the other.
Answer: There were two erroneous descriptions related to the comment, so we would like
4
to fix them.
First, in the figure captions for Figure 5 and Figure S10, we used a scan rate of 10 mV
s–1, which was one-tenth of that in Figure S9. For a surface-attached electroactive species,
the magnitudes of peak current are proportional to the scan rate. If one compares the
results, one can notice that the haemprotein-modified electrode system showed the
characteristic behaviour. Now, we fixed the incorrect values (100 mV s–1) to the correct
ones.
The other is a mistake in the software we used. Simulation of CV was performed
using the calculation function that was provided by the potentiostat, not DigSim. So, we
revised the corresponding part in the text as follows.
(p 6, l 7) DigiSim computer software (BAS Inc.) was used to reproduce the experimental
voltammetric curves. A model ALS 750 potentiostat (BAS Inc., Tokyo, Japan) collected
the electrochemical responses and its built-in software served to reproduce them.
Negative formal potential shifts (vs cytochrome c) for microperoxidases result, in part,
from aqueous exposure of the heme, which stabilizes the ferric form relative to the
ferrous. Also, the axial bonding is different. Harry Gray’s group has addressed the
redox properties of microperoxidases.
We accept the reviewer’s criticism and a report from Professor Gray’s group is now
included as Ref.37. Based on their achievements, we revised text as given below.

(p 10, l 9) Comparing with the SOWG data, one may notice that the formal potential E°',
taken as (Epc + Epa)/2, shifts by 340 mV to the negative direction, which could be
primarily explained by the pH dependence of E°' (59 mV/pH),.36 and by the hydrophobic
environment attained at the ITO surface.37 It is also shown that the reduction potential of
haem c confined in cytochromes c can be modified by roughly 500 mV through
variations in the degree of haem-exposure to solvent.37 At the HXT-monolayer surface
MP-11 as well as NAcMP showed a considerably negative formal potentials, which is
presumably solvent-exposed to a great extent. Contrastingly, we can expect that the ITO-
adsorbed state effectively hinders the solvent access to the haem as cytochromes c attain.

Table 2. According to the mechanism, which seems valid, the presence of H2O2
should have no effect on the formal potential of equation (6) whereas the table shows a
major shift.
In the above-mentioned report, Professor Gray’s group report that coordination of the
haem with certain types of the sixth-ligands including N-acetylmethionine (AcMet) caused
a positive shift of the formal potential (E°’) of the haem.36 The electrocatalytic reaction of
the haemperoxidase involve the sixth-coordination of the haem-Fe(III) with H2O2, which
could result in a particular shift of E°’. Currently, we are not aware whether the H2O2–
coordination occurs preferentially to the haem-Fe(II) or the haem-Fe(III) in NAcMP. We
expect that, similarly with AcMet the affinity of H2O2-cordination with haem-Fe(II) is
considerably higher than that of the oxidized peptide, which increased the haem reduction
potential. Based on these consideration, we revised text as given below.
(p 11, l 9) that catalytic reaction was occurring. It is reported that coordination of the haem
with certain types of the sixth-ligands including N-acetylmethionine (AcMet) caused a
positive shift of the E°’ of the haem. E°’ is an expression of the relative stability of the two
redox partners under the particular conditions including the medium used for
measurements. Currently, we are not aware whether the H2O2–coordination occurs
preferentially to the haem-Fe(II) or the haem-Fe(III) in NAcMP. Yet, we expect that,
similarly with AcMet, the affinity of H2O2-cordination with haem-Fe(II) is considerably
higher than that of the oxidized peptide, which increased the haem reduction potential. The

Results are also presented without any statistics such as standard deviation.
Answer: Electrochemical measurements were repeated several times including the
haempeptide-modified electrode preparations to be used for experiments. We confirmed
that the haempeptide-modified electrode exhibited electrochemical responses with fairly
good reproducibility. However, currently the batch-to-batch variations of the enzymatic
activity of synthesized MP-11 remains as a problem. Therefore, we would like to address
the electrochemical parameters with statistic reliability after solving the problems of
chemical synthesis of MP-11 in the near future.
