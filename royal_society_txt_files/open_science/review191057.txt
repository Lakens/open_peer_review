Apart from a few very minor typographic changes, and the amendation of the PMU specimen's
number, the manuscript is ready for publication as is. Would have been great to have some
images of Dongyangosaurus but it would seem that this was not possible. Also, interesting to
note how different the tree topology was from other iterations of this matrix...

The manuscript presented by Mannion and collaborators re-describes in detail the materials from
Jiangshanosaurus, at the time that they presented new information from another important taxon
from China (Dongyangosaurus). Besides the further anatomical details coming from the
descriptions, the manuscript results of great importance and impact due to the low information
available from Asiatic somphospondylans and how they could impact on our current knowledge
about the evolution of this clade. I found the manuscript interesting as many of the Laurasian
taxa introduced in the analysis are generally not considered in discussion on evolution and paleo-
biogeography. The authors call the attention on that. So, I think this manuscript will be helpful to
understand the evolution of somphospondylan sauropods further.
The descriptions are detailed, precise, and well figured. My primary comment is about the use of
two different criterions for running the analysis (under equal weights and under implied
weighting). I am in agree in using different approaches for the tree searches, other than the
conventional parsimony analysis under equally weighting characters, but I think that a short
mention of what implied weighting analysis means will help readers to understand why the
authors decide to try these two methods.
Additionally, and most important, is the decision on the K used for the implied weight analysis.
3
By default, the TNT uses a K=3. Nevertheless, higher values are recommended to be used (as
Goloboff et al. noted in 2008 and more recently in Goloboff 2017; see references below). So, I do
not think that the use of the default K will be the better choice for the implied weighting analysis,
and I will recommend the use of a higher value (8-12 sounds more accurate).
In page 15 (lines 10-17), the authors mention that Jiangshanosaurus present many plesiomorphic
features for Titanosauriformes. Based on most previous analyses, I agree with that. But, what
about the EIW analysis in which Andesaurus is recovered in a basal position, and therefore most
somphospondylans are titanosaurs?. The same for the following paragraph and the position of
Andesaurus. This discussion fit perfectly with the topology obtained in the most previous
analysis but not for the EIW results.
I think, that if the authors decide to re-run the EIW analysis and they find similar results to that
showed here, a short comment should be introduced to clarify the use of systematic statements.
For example, I like the idea of referring some taxa as basal somphospondylans if, irrespective of
the position of Andesaurus, they are recovered in both analyses closer to the Titanosauriformes
node than to Saltasaurus (as discussed for Tastavinsaurus and Europatitan). But, sounds some
confusing when Titanosauria is used, as based on EWP and EIW the node that defines
Titanosauria changes drastically (e.g., page 18, line 39; Our new topologies also suggest that
Baotianmansaurus henanensis, Huanghetitan liujiaxiaensis and ‘Huanghetitan’ ruyangensis
probably lie outside of Titanosauria too). Here will be better to mention that these taxa are basal
somphospondylans instead of non-titanosaurs, as they are titanosaurs in the EIW analysis.
Besides these comments I found the paper very interesting, and I think it is a significant
contribution to alert further researchers into including Laurasian taxa in phylogenetic and/or
paleo-biogeographic discussion.

specimen's number, the manuscript is ready for publication as is. Would have been
great to have some images of Dongyangosaurus but it would seem that this was not
possible. Also, interesting to note how different the tree topology was from other
iterations of this matrix...
Response: We have corrected the typographic changes highlighted by the reviewer
(with the exception of retaining ‘predating’ rather than ‘pre-dating’), as well as the
amended specimen number. We agree it would be great to include photographs of
the Dongyangosaurus material, but these were all taken through glass, in poor
lighting and, by necessity, at unorthodox angles, therefore greatly limiting their utility.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript presented by Mannion and collaborators re-describes in detail the
materials from Jiangshanosaurus, at the time that they presented new information
from another important taxon from China (Dongyangosaurus). Besides the further
anatomical details coming from the descriptions, the manuscript results of great
importance and impact due to the low information available from Asiatic
somphospondylans and how they could impact on our current knowledge about the
evolution of this clade. I found the manuscript interesting as many of the Laurasian
taxa introduced in the analysis are generally not considered in discussion on
evolution and paleo-biogeography. The authors call the attention on that. So, I think
this manuscript will be helpful to understand the evolution of somphospondylan
sauropods further.
Response: We thank the reviewer for their positive comments. No actions requested.
The descriptions are detailed, precise, and well figured. My primary comment is
about the use of two different criterions for running the analysis (under equal weights
and under implied weighting). I am in agree in using different approaches for the tree
searches, other than the conventional parsimony analysis under equally weighting
characters, but I think that a short mention of what implied weighting analysis means
will help readers to understand why the authors decide to try these two methods.
Additionally, and most important, is the decision on the K used for the implied weight
analysis. By default, the TNT uses a K=3. Nevertheless, higher values are
recommended to be used (as Goloboff et al. noted in 2008 and more recently in
Goloboff 2017; see references below). So, I do not think that the use of the default K
will be the better choice for the implied weighting analysis, and I will recommend the
use of a higher value (8-12 sounds more accurate).
Response: The reviewer makes an excellent point. Rather than replacing our
analysis using a k-value of 3, we have instead added a third analysis, using a k-
value of 9. We have also provided some explanation of what extended implied
weighting actually is, including incorporating the suggested Goloboff reference.
In page 15 (lines 10-17), the authors mention that Jiangshanosaurus present many
plesiomorphic features for Titanosauriformes. Based on most previous analyses, I
agree with that. But, what about the EIW analysis in which Andesaurus is recovered
in a basal position, and therefore most somphospondylans are titanosaurs?. The
same for the following paragraph and the position of Andesaurus. This discussion fit
perfectly with the topology obtained in the most previous analysis but not for the EIW
results. I think, that if the authors decide to re-run the EIW analysis and they find
similar results to that showed here, a short comment should be introduced to clarify
the use of systematic statements. For example, I like the idea of referring some taxa
as basal somphospondylans if, irrespective of the position of Andesaurus, they are
recovered in both analyses closer to the Titanosauriformes node than to Saltasaurus
(as discussed for Tastavinsaurus and Europatitan). But, sounds some confusing
when Titanosauria is used, as based on EWP and EIW the node that defines
Titanosauria changes drastically (e.g., page 18, line 39; Our new topologies also
suggest that Baotianmansaurus henanensis, Huanghetitan liujiaxiaensis and
‘Huanghetitan’ ruyangensis probably lie outside of Titanosauria too). Here will be
better to mention that these taxa are basal somphospondylans instead of non-
titanosaurs, as they are titanosaurs in the EIW analysis.
Response: We have tried to clarify this issue throughout the text. Early in our
Discussion we have added “Below, our use of the clade name Titanosauria refers to
the topology recovered in our EWP analysis” and, when appropriate, we have used
terms like ‘basal somphospondylan’ rather than non-titanosaur. We had already
noted that this ‘stemward slippage’ of Andesaurus has occurred in all previous
iterations of this matrix (going back to 2013), and so it is not a novel result.
