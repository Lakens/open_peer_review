This is an interesting paper that adds something to the literature on the effects of waviness
defects. Overall it could merit publication for some of the experimental approaches taken,
although there is no major contribution to the understanding of waviness defects beyond what is
available elsewhere in the literature.
In the introduction it is noted that through standardised testing the strength of an impacted
laminate can be treated as a material property. This is a long way from being generally accepted
and the statement is probably best avoided. In para 2 it is noted that three methods of generating
fibre waviness have been demonstrated, there are at least two or three additional methods that
have been developed, some of which mimic industrial defect generation processes, with others
aimed at providing tightly reproducible defects in a ply by ply lay-up. The literature review is not
entirely complete.
In section 2 the quoted ply thickness is very high. The reason for this is understandable but it
does introduce a question mark over whether the results are truly representative. Equally, the
details of the process to generate the wrinkles is a bit sketchy, it is not stated for example if any
debulking has been done. The ability of one ply to slip over the one below is likely to be
important with this approach to producing wrinkles, so the lay-up process, consolidation, bulk
factor, forming rate and temperature should all be controlled if the target is a reproducible
process. The use of a hot press to cure panels will also have an impact on the wrinkle geometry
by enforcing a constant thickness when the wrinkled regions would be expected to be above the
mean ply thickness. Lastly, when the ply is laid down onto the corner there will be a tendency for
the fibres on the inner radius to become buckled and wavy due to the path difference between the
inner and outer surface of the ply. It is not obvious that this waviness will be fully relieved when
the ply is flattened and the excess length in the ply stack leads to buckling on the outer surface.
The overall buckling state is therefore likely to be down to a rather complicated interaction
between the as-supplied prepreg fibre waviness, the as-laid-up ply waviness and the as-flattened
ply waviness. From the description of the process it seems that the corner radius would need to
vary from one order to the next to maintain a constant wavy length. If that is the case the as-laid
ply waviness will also change with % waviness.
I am a bit confused by the definition of % nominal waviness, is it in effect % excess length? If not I
think a clear definition is needed.
In 2.2 it is not entirely clear to me what is being measured. Fig 3 shows a local measurement but
the misalignment is surely continuously varying from point to point.
In 2.3 it is not clear why compression loading was selected when using the wavy face in tension
would have allowed direct DIC examination. The effects of waviness on strength are as visible in
tension as in compression.
The laminate quality shown in fig 4 is rather poor, the authors are encouraged to consider
whether this could have contributed to the results.
3
In fig 6 there should surely be two regions of significant misalignment assuming a regular
sinusoidal form, why is this not apparent?
In the discussion it is stated that the defects are reproducible. This is clearly not the case as in fig
11 the two areas of significant misalignment are of very different morphology within a single
specimen. For example on the right hand side there is significant out of plane distortion.
At line 31 on page 8 it notes that ultrasound measurements can be used to predict strength. The
earlier description of how these measurements were made seemed a lot more complex than a
conventional C scan, is it realistic to use such techniques in examining large structures (such as
the wind turbine blades that have been the focus of some of the fibre waviness research). Again
for real structures of any complexity extracting residual stresses by comparison of expected and
actual geometry is unrealistic.
Overall this is an interesting paper but I don't think the authors have fully justified their
conclusions in that the waviness generating technique currently clearly lacks control and
reproducibility and there are question marks around practical applicability. However I would
recommend that there is enough potential interest to allow the authors to resubmit an amended
manuscript addressing the issues raised here.

The paper is interesting and well written. The aim of the authors is to develop a new method to
find and control defects in composite materials. This new method consists in measuring the
residual strain fields. The authors show the effectiveness of the method by finding a relation
between the measured residual strain values and the bending moment that causes the failure of
the specimens.

The main drawback, in my opinion, is that all the experimental tests and measurements have
been performed on plane specimens and it could be really difficult to apply the method to
complex geometries.
I think the method could be effective but authors should finalize their work by indicating a
possible practical application.
Specific comments:
-the dimensions of the specimens are not explicit: add a figure with the dimensions of the
specimens and the origin of coordinate system.
-The results are shown as plots but no relationships are indicated: the authors should add the
relationships between the investigated parameters and indicate in a quantitative manner the
effect of waviness on residual strains, eg the percentage of waviness and the corresponding
percentage of residual strain increase.

Authors’ Response to Reviewers’ Comments
on Manuscript RSOS-180082
We are grateful for the time the reviewers have put into reading the manuscript and for
their suggestions on how it can be improved. The comments by the reviewers and our response to
each request are below.
Response to Reviewer 1
1. This is an interesting paper that adds something to the literature on the effects of waviness defects.
Overall it could merit publication for some of the experimental approaches taken, although there is no
major contribution to the understanding of waviness defects beyond what is available elsewhere in the
literature.
<U+F0D8> Thank you for the complementary comments. Our intention was to develop a better experimental
technique both to permit investigations of fibre waviness and to generate high-quality data to
support the development and validation of computational models. We have added statements on
the latter explicitly in the abstract, discussion and conclusions.
2. In the introduction it is noted that through standardised testing the strength of an impacted laminate
can be treated as a material property. This is a long way from being generally accepted and the
statement is probably best avoided.
<U+F0D8> We accept that our statement about standardised testing was inappropriate and the paragraph no
longer refers to the strength after impact being treated as a material property.
3. In para 2 it is noted that three methods of generating fibre waviness have been demonstrated, there
are at least two or three additional methods that have been developed, some of which mimic industrial
defect generation processes, with others aimed at providing tightly reproducible defects in a ply by ply
lay-up. The literature review is not entirely complete.
<U+F0D8> Thank you for prompting an update of the literature survey. Three additional techniques have been
added with two focusing on the creation of specific shapes of waviness.
4. In section 2 the quoted ply thickness is very high. The reason for this is understandable but it does
introduce a question mark over whether the results are truly representative.
<U+F0D8> One of our primary aims was to support the development of reliable models of fibre-waviness and
hence we felt that a slight higher ply thickness was acceptable. We have added discussion of this
issue to the second paragraph of the discussion.
5. Equally, the details of the process to generate the wrinkles is a bit sketchy, it is not stated for example
if any debulking has been done.
<U+F0D8> Debulking was not performed, the specimen fabrication section now states this and more details of
the process have been included.
6. The ability of one ply to slip over the one below is likely to be important with this approach to
producing wrinkles, so the lay-up process, consolidation, bulk factor, forming rate and temperature
should all be controlled if the target is a reproducible process.
<U+F0D8> The lay-up was performed by hand and no consolidation was performed. All of the mentioned
parameters were controlled by the hot press during the cure and the text has been updated to
include this information.
7. The use of a hot press to cure panels will also have an impact on the wrinkle geometry by enforcing a
constant thickness when the wrinkled regions would be expected to be above the mean ply thickness.
<U+F0D8> Yes, the reviewer is correct and this has been addressed in the first paragraph of the discussion. We
have suggested that a manufacturer interested in in-plane waviness when using an autoclave would
be able to perform the same experiments using an autoclave in place of our hot press.
1
8. Lastly, when the ply is laid down onto the corner there will be a tendency for the fibres on the inner
radius to become buckled and wavy due to the path difference between the inner and outer surface of
the ply. It is not obvious that this waviness will be fully relieved when the ply is flattened and the
excess length in the ply stack leads to buckling on the outer surface. The overall buckling state is
therefore likely to be down to a rather complicated interaction between the as-supplied prepreg fibre
waviness, the as-laid-up ply waviness and the as-flattened ply waviness.
<U+F0D8> No buckling was observed on the inner radius of the specimens; an explicit statement to this effect
has been included in the first paragraph of the specimen fabrication section. In addition, the
possibility of waviness in the as-supplied prepreg is now discussed in the second paragraph of the
discussion.
9. From the description of the process it seems that the corner radius would need to vary from one order
to the next to maintain a constant wavy length. If that is the case the as-laid ply waviness will also
change with % waviness.
<U+F0D8> The corner radius and the angle of the corner was varied to achieve different levels of nominal
waviness, and a table has been added to the specimen fabrication section giving the key dimensions
for the formers used in this study. No as-laid waviness was observed and this has been stated in the
first paragraph of the Specimen Fabrication section.
10. I am a bit confused by the definition of % nominal waviness, is it in effect % excess length? If not I think
a clear definition is needed.
<U+F0D8> This is correct, the first paragraph of the specimen fabrication section has been updated to clarify this.
11. In 2.2 it is not entirely clear to me what is being measured. Fig 3 shows a local measurement but the
misalignment is surely continuously varying from point to point.
<U+F0D8> Yes, the misalignment does vary across the ply and the ultrasonic technique is capable of measuring
this variation. This has been clarified in the ultrasonic characterisation section. An amplitude C-scan,
from which subsets are used to measure local fibre waviness, has been added to figure 3 to make it
easier for the reader to understand the algorithm.
12. In 2.3 it is not clear why compression loading was selected when using the wavy face in tension would
have allowed direct DIC examination. The effects of waviness on strength are as visible in tension as in
compression.
<U+F0D8> The doctoral work from which this manuscript is derived was focused on the detection and
characterisation of defects using strain data. The choice was made during the experimental design for
that work to attempt to characterise defects on the unobservable surface, as it demonstrates that the
developed techniques were capable of detecting defects through healthy material. The choice of
placing the defects in compression was to ensure that the defect had the greatest effect on remnant
strength; this had been observed in previous work which is now referenced in the digital image
correlation characterisation section. Defects in compression for composites is also of particular
interest for the aerospace industry.
13. The laminate quality shown in fig 4 is rather poor, the authors are encouraged to consider whether this
could have contributed to the results.
<U+F0D8> A large number of samples were made and a statistical analysis performed in order to identify the
appropriate relationships and conclusions from the results. The quality of the laminate based on the
micrographs is now discussed in the second paragraph of the discussion section.
14. In fig 6 there should surely be two regions of significant misalignment assuming a regular sinusoidal
form, why is this not apparent?
<U+F0D8> The references to sinusoidal waves have been deleted because they were misleading. There is no
reason to expect sinusoidal waves to be generated in preference to other waveforms and this has
been made clear in the revised manuscript with a supporting reference included. Indeed the data in
figure 6 implies that the fibres have taken up a z-shape. The text describing figure 6 in the results
section has been modified to provide a more explicit description of the data.
2
15. In the discussion it is stated that the defects are reproducible. This is clearly not the case as in fig 11 the
two areas of significant misalignment are of very different morphology within a single specimen. For
example on the right hand side there is significant out of plane distortion.
<U+F0D8> Statements specifying that the defects are reproducible have been removed. The microstructure
shown in figure 11 is severely deformed as a result of the loading and subsequent fracture, especially
on the left side where the fractures are more severe and as a consequence the form of the original
waviness defect is no longer apparent. The fracture on the right at ‘c’ is less severe and some of the
form of the original defect can be discerned. Comments to this effect have been added to last
paragraph of the results section where figure 11 is described.
16. At line 31 on page 8 it notes that ultrasound measurements can be used to predict strength. The earlier
description of how these measurements were made seemed a lot more complex than a conventional C
scan, is it realistic to use such techniques in examining large structures (such as the wind turbine blades
that have been the focus of some of the fibre waviness research).
<U+F0D8> Industry has been conducting C-scans on curved components for some time. For example, Olympus
sell systems specifically for conducting C-scans on wind turbine blades using a frame that is attached
to the blade using suction cups and features spring mounted probes that can follow the contours of
the aerofoil. Once the C-scan data has been captured it can be processed using the algorithm
described in the Ultrasonic Characterisation section and thus once the algorithm has been
implemented no further work would be required. The sixth paragraph of the discussion has been
updated to make the reader aware that C-scans can be performed on curved structures and that the
captured data can be processed using the same algorithm.
17. Again for real structures of any complexity extracting residual stresses by comparison of expected and
actual geometry is unrealistic.
<U+F0D8> The sixth paragraph of the discussion section has been amended to raise this issue and discusses how
it can be solved for sections of components that have simple planar or cylindrical shapes.
18. Overall this is an interesting paper but I don't think the authors have fully justified their conclusions in
that the waviness generating technique currently clearly lacks control and reproducibility and there are
question marks around practical applicability.
<U+F0D8> The statements about control have been removed and additional discussion about the practical
applicability have been added, including the generation of data to support the development and
validation of computational models.
19. However I would recommend that there is enough potential interest to allow the authors to resubmit
an amended manuscript addressing the issues raised here.
<U+F0D8> Thank you for the opportunity to address the issues. We have amended the manuscript as carefully
as we can to address the issues.
Response to Reviewer 2
1. The paper is interesting and well written. The aim of the authors is to develop a new method to find
and control defects in composite materials. This new method consists in measuring the residual strain
fields. The authors show the effectiveness of the method by finding a relation between the measured
residual strain values and the bending moment that causes the failure of the specimens.
The main drawback, in my opinion, is that all the experimental tests and measurements have been
performed on plane specimens and it could be really difficult to apply the method to complex
geometries.
<U+F0D8> Yes, of course the use of plane specimens is a drawback but also represent a significant first step. A
discussion on the practicality of predicting remnant strength using ultrasound or residual strain
measurements for non-planar components has been added.
3
2. I think the method could be effective but authors should finalize their work by indicating a possible
practical application.
<U+F0D8> Sentences inserted in the discussion now consider the effect of waviness and its assessment for
primary load-bearing components in wing structures. Discussion on the use of the technique to
generate data to support the development and validation of computational models has been added in
the abstract, discussion and conclusions.
Specific comments:
3. The dimensions of the specimens are not explicit: add a figure with the dimensions of the specimens
and the origin of coordinate system.
<U+F0D8> The dimensions and the position of the coordinate system’s origin have been added to Figure 2.
4. The results are shown as plots but no relationships are indicated: the authors should add the
relationships between the investigated parameters and indicate in a quantitative manner the effect of
waviness on residual strains, e.g. the percentage of waviness and the corresponding percentage of
residual strain increase.
<U+F0D8> All of the graphs have had lines of best fit added to them. A figure showing the relationship between
nominal waviness and residual strains has also been added.
