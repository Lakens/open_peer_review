I have revised the manuscript “Flood pulse influences on multispecies fisheries yields in the
Amazon”. This is a nice compact study with relevant findings. And besides based on a short
database – just 12 years (1993-2004), the authors found some interesting relations between fishing
yield, fishing effort and flood pulse. The author’s main conclusion is that floods and droughts are
both key drivers controlling fisheries yields, with some differences of the effect signal between
trophic guilds.
There are no critical mistakes or statistical inconsistences in this manuscript. However, the
authors aiming to improve it should address some points. As a general question, I suggest a
renewed effort to read some papers that had already addressed the effects of climatic events on
fisheries or fish diversity/abundance at the Amazon basin. Some of them I’ll cite after specific
comments, however I believe that Freitas et al. (2013) published on Hydrobiologia could be very
useful.
Although there are no data to test the hypothesis, I believe that the “match-mismatch hypothesis”
proposed by Cushing should be included in the discussion. The author’s discussion proposed
that the flood positive effects could be associated with the expansion of the aquatic environment,
increasing availability of feeding items at the floodplain during critical stages of the fish life cycle.
And this is closely related with Cushing hypothesis.
Specific Comments
Abstract
Lines 15-18: The sentence started as “Years of intense floods ....” sounds as an overgeneralization.
There are studies showing that signal effects should be specific dependent – some species could
take advantages of extreme droughts (See Freitas et al. 2013 on Hydrobiologia).
Lines 19-21: Please, include the time interval of the “historical record”.
Introduction
In general, the authors did a good job stating the main question addressed in this manuscript.
However, I suggest they explore better how deep could be the changes in large rivers systems
with adjacent floodplains between flood and dry seasons.
Lines 42-44: The sentence beginning as “In the floodplains, …” is an overgeneralization. This is
true just for a group of fish.
Lines 52-54: The sentence “Rising water levels …” also is an overgeneralization.
Material and Methods
Besides some points highlighted ahead, I think that the methods are straightforward and
addressed the proposed questions. I’ve just one critical question:
- The authors realized that the response to floods and droughts should be species dependent and
clustered them by guilds. However, I believe that an aspect more relevant than feeding habits
could be whether the species is a short living or a long living species. This characteristic should
be related with the “time of the first catch” or with the “fishing recruitment age (length)”. I
believe that clustering the species by this criteria could improve the model robustness.
Lines 98-100: Please, here are critical points.
How important are fishing using motorized boats? Are you talking on Amazon inland fisheries
or just on Amazon inland fisheries using motorized boats?
Same question for gillnets: how important are fishing employing gillnets as fishing gear in
comparison with other gears? “redinha” a kind of purse seine is very important in other areas of
the Amazon basin.
3
Lines 100-101: Have you employed some technique to take this effort unit as the most
appropriate? Or you’re employing it due a literature suggestion (include reference in this case?
Results
The results are quite consistent with the analysis methods. Nevertheless I’ll insist that clustering
the species by their “fishing recruitment age (length)” could reduce the model uncertainties. This
approach could change the results.
Discussion
Lines 217-218: The cause-effect relationship proposed here is unclear. Please, expand the idea.
Lines 223-225: Have you references to support the statement “The piscivore and herbivore guilds
… duriventre)”?
Lines 225-229: A study published by Anjos et al. (2008) showed that hypoxic environments could
be refuge against predators in the Amazonian floodplains.
Lines 243-245: Freitas et al. (2013) had already detected a positive effect of an extreme drought on
some herbivores and planktivores species.
Lines 263-266: The sentence starting as “Food availability… floodplain forest” isn’t supported by
results or by reference (39) as well. Besides the statement “detritivores are only moderately
exploited” isn’t true. Prochilodus nigricans is the third main exploited species in your data base
and the main exploited species for the basin as a whole.
Lines 267-270: I recommend the paper published by Santana & Freitas (2013) with a tome series
analysis of Prochilodus nigricans landings.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
I believe this study includes a valuable analysis of relatively long-term fisheries data in relation to
flow-regime characteristics. I do think the clarity of the writing can be improved to better convey
the specific findings. I also believe that the discussion goes too far beyond the scope of the study
in its speculations and think it would be better if the discussion were reduced and more focused
on actual findings. Here are specific suggestions:
1. For a general audience, it would help if some of the items mentioned in the introduction and
methods were explained a bit. I appreciate the general brevity used, but in some cases a bit more
introduction of important topics would greatly assist readers, especially those less familiar with
fish ecology or Amazonian biology.
1a. An example is line 70 where r-strategists are mentioned with no explanation. For a reader to
understand this, it would help to briefly explain what an r-strategist is and why they have been
the focus of prior studies. However, I don't find any other reference to life-history strategies
throughout the manuscript, so I'm wondering if this detail is actually irrelevant. Further, most
fisheries biologists now use the trilateral life-history continuum of Winemiller. If this life-history
information is critical for the manuscript it might be better to switch over to his more modern and
descriptive terminology.
1b. It would ease things for the reader if varzea was briefly defined (line 93).
1c. Line 93 - the sentence beginning here (Fishing occurs...) is problematic. First there is a
contradiction in which fishing is said to be year round, but mainly during migration (which is
correct?). Next it would be better if the specific timing of migrations was stated.
1d. "Feeding strategies" are mentioned several times (line 103 to begin with), but are not defined.
From the results and discussion I gather this refers to omnivores, herbivores, and piscivores, but
it would be better if this was stated in the methods when first mentioned. Wording on line 156 is
especially confusing.
1e. Line 105 - "indices based on"? I think the answer is in the reference, but I think it would be
better if this was explained in words here so that authors don't need to read another reference to
understand important methods used in this study.
1f. I think the flood and drought indices are calculated as amplitude times duration based on
Figure 1, but it would be better if this was clearly explained in the methods (lines 105-108).
1g. A brief definition of chavascal would be beneficial.
1h. Line 129 - What alpha level or r level was used as a cutoff for correlations of explanatory
variables? It might be useful to provide the cutoff here in text and provide the correlation results
in a supplemental file.
I find it particularly difficult to believe F and D were uncorrelated as D is clearly dependent on F
(if I understand them correctly). For instance, a longer F in a given year requires that D will be
shorter (more days in F subtracts days directly from D). Similarly, I would expect a higher
amplitude in F corresponds with a lower amplitude in D. If these relations are not true, then it
would be good if the actual relations were explained in detail because they would run counter to
general expectations. This explanation would help readers better understand the study.
2. Line 86 - I am not sure what is meant by "do floods influence fisheries yields more than
droughts". It would help if the actual results that distinguish these hypotheses were explained, at
least in general terms, so that the reader knows going in what will constitute a greater influence
of floods versus droughts.
5
3. In general, I find the terminology of flood versus drought confusing. In my experience,
drought is not an routine, annual event, it is an exceptionally dry period. I am not sure what the
typical terminology is for the Amazon, but I have always heard terminology such as wet versus
dry seasons. Assuming my confusion might be widespread among readers, I encourage the
authors to consider a different, more descriptive terminology such as wet versus dry season or
out of versus within bank seasons.
4. A related source of confusion came in the discussion where there is reference to "flood-pulse
effects" (which I think should be hyphenated by the way). When I first read these words I
thought the authors were referring just to the flood portion of the hydrograph (F) but then I
eventually realized they meant both flood and drought (indicating co-dependence). I think
clarity would be improved if the authors kept flood and drought separate in their discussion
since they seem to keep them separate up to that point and also claim that they are uncorrelated
effects.
5. The detailed hypotheses throughout the discussion seem to be way beyond the scope of the
actual study. I don't find any specific data on how specific feeding guilds are limited or enhanced
by floods or droughts. I suggest that this part of the discussion could be greatly reduced to a
paragraph or two on general interpretations (largely following expectations presented in the
introduction) and a bit on how feeding guilds differ to direct future research. This would also cut
down on repetitiveness. The authors mention there is "poor understanding" of flood-pulse
influences on fish populations" (line 279), which suggests their detailed speculations have
minimal foundation. The final paragraph seems to extend way beyond the actual findings of this
study. Something more focused and supportable would greatly strengthen the paper.
On line 267 there is reference to a prior study. I think this part of the discussion could be
expanded and in any case more detail is required. For instance, it is stated that both studies
(prior and present) found a positive effect of floods three years prior, but in this study I only see
that result for omnivores (Fig. 2). It is also stated that both studies found a negative effect of low
waters two years prior, which I see in the present study for all fishes, piscivores, and herbivores
(Fig. 2). A more detailed discussion of this comparison might be valuable and also I was initially
confused as to whether "low waters" referred to lower floods or drought. It would be good if this
was clarified and consistent terminology was used throughout.
6. Perhaps my greatest source of confusion was in the timing of floods, droughts, and fishing
effort in analysis of a given year's fishery production. If I understand correctly, the effects of
prior floods and droughts were assessed (previous years affected a subsequent year), whereas the
effects of that year's fishing effort were assessed on fishery production (e.g. more fishing effort in
a given year led to more fishery production that same year).
6a. First, I suggest the terminology in the discussion could be more clear to indicate these details.
For example, on line 211 I would say "prior floods" and "prior droughts" decrease yields in
"subsequent years". Another example is on line 273 where I suggest "The influence of prior
floods on later yields could be a function...". On line 274 I suggest "The observed influence of
prior droughts on later yields indicates...". Making this terminology explicit and consistent
throughout would help ensure readers properly understand this study.
6b. Another factor I wonder about though is if more severe droughts increase fishing efficiency
then couldn't prior fishing effort or prior fishery production also be an important predictor of
future fishery production? That is, if the previous 2 or 3 years had more severe drought and
higher fishing pressure or production wouldn't that potentially affect production in subsequent
years? As it is, the study does not include a potential role for fishing pressure to influence fishery
production. It seems the data are available to include in the linear models and I recommend that
some additional models be run including either prior fishing effort, prior fishery production (or
both) to investigate this possibility.
6
7. Minor comments:
Line 57 - successful (not successfully)
Line 142 - was (not were)
Line 165 - was this log10?
Lines 174-175 - delete "year" on both lines
Line 212 - A new topic/paragraph seems to begin at "However". I would combine the latter part
of this paragraph with the following paragraph (same topic) and expand the former part of this
paragraph to discuss potential effects of fishing effort or production in previous years on fishery
production in subsequent years.
Lines 214-216 - This is a very vague statement and weakens the study. A more specific statement
clearly explaining what is meant here would strengthen the study.
Line 235 - "can limit access"
Lines 257-259 - I already mentioned that I think the discussion strays too far from the data, but
also it gets confusing. Here, it seems to say mortality increases survival and biomass, which is
contradictory at face value. I think it is supposed to convey that cohort thinning early in life can
lead to higher survival and growth for surviving individuals later in life, but this is not clearly
explained. Also, even if this is true, it's not clear that this would lead to a greater biomass of
harvest. Certainly it would depend on the specific levels of early mortality versus later survival
and growth. In other words, it would depend a specific scenario of density dependent mortality
and subsequent survival and growth, but my understanding is there is no data on these dynamics
for any of the fishes studied, so what is the likelihood of this possible explanation versus
alternatives? I find this type of discussion not only confusing but also highly speculative. If it is
justified, then it would help to have very clear explanations documented extensively with
supportive references and data.
Line 303 - "omissions are our own"
I hope these suggestion are beneficial.

I have revised the manuscript “Flood pulse influences on multispecies fisheries yields in the
Amazon”. This is a nice compact study with relevant findings. And besides based on a short

yield, fishing effort and flood pulse. The author’s main conclusion is that floods and droughts are
both key drivers controlling fisheries yields, with some differences of the effect signal between
trophic guilds.
There are no critical mistakes or statistical inconsistences in this manuscript. However, the

that the flood positive effects could be associated with the expansion of the aquatic environment,
increasing availability of feeding items at the floodplain during critical stages of the fish life cycle.
And this is closely related with Cushing hypothesis.

I believe this study includes a valuable analysis of relatively long-term fisheries data in relation to
flow-regime characteristics. I do think the clarity of the writing can be improved to better convey
the specific findings. I also believe that the discussion goes too far beyond the scope of the study
in its speculations and think it would be better if the discussion were reduced and more focused
on actual findings. Here are specific suggestions:
1. For a general audience, it would help if some of the items mentioned in the introduction and

1f. I think the flood and drought indices are calculated as amplitude times duration based on

1g. A brief definition of chavascal would be beneficial.
11
1h. Line 129 - What alpha level or r level was used as a cutoff for correlations of explanatory
variables? It might be useful to provide the cutoff here in text and provide the correlation results
in a supplemental file.
I find it particularly difficult to believe F and D were uncorrelated as D is clearly dependent on F
(if I understand them correctly). For instance, a longer F in a given year requires that D will be
shorter (more days in F subtracts days directly from D). Similarly, I would expect a higher
amplitude in F corresponds with a lower amplitude in D. If these relations are not true, then it
would be good if the actual relations were explained in detail because they would run counter to
general expectations. This explanation would help readers better understand the study.
2. Line 86 - I am not sure what is meant by "do floods influence fisheries yields more than
droughts". It would help if the actual results that distinguish these hypotheses were explained, at
least in general terms, so that the reader knows going in what will constitute a greater influence
of floods versus droughts.
3. In general, I find the terminology of flood versus drought confusing. In my experience,
drought is not an routine, annual event, it is an exceptionally dry period. I am not sure what the
typical terminology is for the Amazon, but I have always heard terminology such as wet versus
dry seasons. Assuming my confusion might be widespread among readers, I encourage the
authors to consider a different, more descriptive terminology such as wet versus dry season or
out of versus within bank seasons.
4. A related source of confusion came in the discussion where there is reference to "flood-pulse

thought the authors were referring just to the flood portion of the hydrograph (F) but then I
eventually realized they meant both flood and drought (indicating co-dependence). I think
clarity would be improved if the authors kept flood and drought separate in their discussion
since they seem to keep them separate up to that point and also claim that they are uncorrelated
effects.
5. The detailed hypotheses throughout the discussion seem to be way beyond the scope of the

by floods or droughts. I suggest that this part of the discussion could be greatly reduced to a
paragraph or two on general interpretations (largely following expectations presented in the

influences on fish populations" (line 279), which suggests their detailed speculations have
minimal foundation. The final paragraph seems to extend way beyond the actual findings of this
study. Something more focused and supportable would greatly strengthen the paper.
On line 267 there is reference to a prior study. I think this part of the discussion could be
expanded and in any case more detail is required. For instance, it is stated that both studies
(prior and present) found a positive effect of floods three years prior, but in this study I only see
that result for omnivores (Fig. 2). It is also stated that both studies found a negative effect of low
waters two years prior, which I see in the present study for all fishes, piscivores, and herbivores
(Fig. 2). A more detailed discussion of this comparison might be valuable and also I was initially
confused as to whether "low waters" referred to lower floods or drought. It would be good if this
was clarified and consistent terminology was used throughout.
6. Perhaps my greatest source of confusion was in the timing of floods, droughts, and fishing
effort in analysis of a given year's fishery production. If I understand correctly, the effects of
prior floods and droughts were assessed (previous years affected a subsequent year), whereas the
effects of that year's fishing effort were assessed on fishery production (e.g. more fishing effort in
a given year led to more fishery production that same year).
12
6a. First, I suggest the terminology in the discussion could be more clear to indicate these details.
For example, on line 211 I would say "prior floods" and "prior droughts" decrease yields in
"subsequent years". Another example is on line 273 where I suggest "The influence of prior
floods on later yields could be a function...". On line 274 I suggest "The observed influence of
prior droughts on later yields indicates...". Making this terminology explicit and consistent
throughout would help ensure readers properly understand this study.
6b. Another factor I wonder about though is if more severe droughts increase fishing efficiency
then couldn't prior fishing effort or prior fishery production also be an important predictor of
future fishery production? That is, if the previous 2 or 3 years had more severe drought and
higher fishing pressure or production wouldn't that potentially affect production in subsequent
years? As it is, the study does not include a potential role for fishing pressure to influence fishery
production. It seems the data are available to include in the linear models and I recommend that
some additional models be run including either prior fishing effort, prior fishery production (or
both) to investigate this possibility.
7. Minor comments:
Line 57 - successful (not successfully)
Line 142 - was (not were)
Line 165 - was this log10?
Lines 174-175 - delete "year" on both lines
Line 212 - A new topic/paragraph seems to begin at "However". I would combine the latter part
of this paragraph with the following paragraph (same topic) and expand the former part of this
paragraph to discuss potential effects of fishing effort or production in previous years on fishery
production in subsequent years.
Lines 214-216 - This is a very vague statement and weakens the study. A more specific statement
clearly explaining what is meant here would strengthen the study.
Line 235 - "can limit access"
Lines 257-259 - I already mentioned that I think the discussion strays too far from the data, but
also it gets confusing. Here, it seems to say mortality increases survival and biomass, which is
contradictory at face value. I think it is supposed to convey that cohort thinning early in life can
lead to higher survival and growth for surviving individuals later in life, but this is not clearly
explained. Also, even if this is true, it's not clear that this would lead to a greater biomass of
harvest. Certainly it would depend on the specific levels of early mortality versus later survival
and growth. In other words, it would depend a specific scenario of density dependent mortality
and subsequent survival and growth, but my understanding is there is no data on these dynamics
for any of the fishes studied, so what is the likelihood of this possible explanation versus
alternatives? I find this type of discussion not only confusing but also highly speculative. If it is
justified, then it would help to have very clear explanations documented extensively with
supportive references and data.
Line 303 - "omissions are our own"
I hope these suggestion are beneficial.

Abstract: Seasonally fluctuating water levels, known as ‘flood pulses,’ control the productivity of
large river fisheries that provide food and income to millions of people globally. Years of intense
floods enable fish growth and recruitment to be more successful, increasing biomass for available
harvesting; whereas years with extreme droughts increase natural and fishing mortality, reducing
fish biomass for harvesting. But the extent and mechanisms through which flood pulses
influence fisheries yields remain poorly understood. This study applied linear regression
techniques to a historical record of water levels and fishing activities for 42 species over a 250 km
stretch of the Amazon River-floodplains. Models based on indices of fishing effort, floods, and
droughts explained most of the interannual variability in yields of all species grouped together or
in four feeding guilds (mean R2 = 0.8). As expected, floods generally increased and droughts
generally decreased yields. However, depending on the guild, floods also reduced and droughts
increased yields, and both floods and droughts interacted. Although primary production often
controls fisheries yields in other ecosystems, floods and droughts exerted equal forcing on
fisheries yields. These results highlight the complexity of the responses of fish populations to
environmental variability in large river ecosystems.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The manuscript is improved and easier to follow due to better focus. Only one major concerns
arises, associated with the first paragraph of the discussion, lines 197-209. This paragraph is
critical, but seems vague and internally inconsistent (it contradicts itself). This is because effects
differed among feeding guilds. I suggest the authors re-organize the discussion to focus first on
results for individual guilds and then, at the end, on the general results. This way, they can
interpret the overall findings in light of the guild-specific findings and this would eliminate the
need for a confusing paragraph that seems contradictory.
My other, but lesser, concern of substance has to do with an oversight I mentioned during my
previous review. The authors seem to assume that fishing effort has no affect on mortality or is a
constant effect independent of flood pulse parameters. This may be a valid view, but as the
authors do not address it at all, there is no way for the reader to know if it is or not.
My point is that I would expect fishing mortality to be higher during low water times because
fish are more concentrated. If so, this could be one source of increased mortality during extended
low-water periods. The authors have apparently chosen not to including fishing pressure within
their analyses, but despite this choice (which I don't understand) they should still address this
potential effect. If there are good reasons to dismiss the potential effects of fishing on overall
biomass, that's fine, but the authors should explain in the methods and/or discussion why this is
the case so that the reader can dismiss this possibility as well. However, if it is possible that
fishing during extended low flow periods does contributed to increased mortality, then this
should be included in the discussion, for example, on line 215. Any additional insights the
authors could include relative to this possibility would be beneficial for informing readers and
potential future researchers.
Minor comments:
Line 98 - move citation to end of sentence and re-word appropriately. Using the citation [4] as a
word does not seem grammatically correct.
Lines 112-115 - this seems to be a run-on sentence.
Lines 115-117 - this seems counter intuitive to me. Excluding the flood pulse indices in the year
fishing took place should create potential for confounding effects, not avoid them. If the
parameter is excluded from the model, then its effects remain unquantified. Please explain more
clearly what was intended here.
Line 127 - change "evaluating" to "evaluation of"
Line 157 - write out "percent", "%" is not a word.
Paragraph line 210 - I think it could be made more clear that the authors specifically hypothesize
that low waters increase mortality, affecting biomass in subsequent years by reducing fish
15
density. Conversely, they propose that floods reduce mortality, which increases biomass in
subsequent years. In some of the descriptions in this and following paragraphs this doesn't come
across clearly.
