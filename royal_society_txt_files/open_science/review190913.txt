Abstract. the last line is abit strange, and very specific to Costa Rica/Amazonia (based on senior
authors previous work), but I feel the sentence could be re-worded and made more general, so it
encompasses other studies and for other regions. Arguably greater ecological information for
Ichneumonids is useful for other regions too!

each species in results. Second, given your year long sampling; how many more samples and
specimens would be needed to be sure?; you cannot just keep sampling until you get a significant
results; and Third (and most importantly), perhaps that these species are generalists and the type
of habitat is not so important, therefore the result is correct.
p7 line 32. sorry but you have NOT clearly demonstrated rhyssines are parasitoids of wood-
boring insects. You have strong support for this, based on your increased catch with decaying

The manuscript has been improved from the earlier version. My concerns about false positives
have been adequately dealt with and explained. My only minor comment is one that i had
8
intended to make in the earlier review but i obviously forgot top do so. It concerns the method
the authors used in Figure 4 to distinguish statistical differences in standardized catches of
Rhyssine species in different habitat types. I think it would be clearer to readers if the authors
used the much more conventional system of denoting differences between habitats using
different letters above the bars. I expect they used this other system as it allows them to specify
the actual probabilities, rather than just those that are less than 0.05. However, if they wish to
stick with the way they have done it, it is not a major sticking point with me.

eral comments
manuscript documents an extensive 1-year survey of Ichneumonid wasps in the subfamily
ssinae in different habitats (primary forests, swampy primary forests, disturbed forests, clearcuts,
farmland) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. The authors monitored catches every 2 weeks in 34
aise traps, collecting a total of 444 specimens in six species, all in the genus Epirhyssa. They used a
eral linear model to test for the influence of forest type, mean daily rainfall, date, and amount of
aying wood near a trap, on catch of each rhyssine species, as well as the subfamily as a whole. They
d that rhyssine catches were greater in dry weather, in primary forest sites with lots of decaying
, and towards the end of the sampling year.
nk this manuscript makes a significant contribution to our meager knowledge of habitat associations
arasitic wasps in the tropics, and especially in tropical Africa. It also outlines the type of studies and
yses that are needed to increase our understanding of the ecology of parasitic wasps. I am not
iliar with the R program mvabund but I watched the introductory video (http://eco-
s.blogspot.com/2012/03/introducing-mvabund-package-and-why.html) and it appears to be a very
d way of analyzing data like those collected by the authors.
ever, I had an issue with the author’s somewhat liberal interpretation of the results of the statistical
yses, specifically regarding differences in catch among the different forest types. For example, on
e 7, lines 12–13, the authors state “We decided to accept the possibility of false positive values, and
did not adjust the probabilities for multiple testing.” This is a very nonconventional statement.
t authors make an effort to maintain the experiment-wise error rate (probability of making a type I
r) at the conventional 5% level by using a Bonferroni correction or by using post-hoc means tests
the Ryan-Einot Gabriel-Welsh test or Tukey’s. I think it would be more acceptable if the authors
e to use a Bonferroni correction for the comparison-wise error rate (0.05/10 = 0.005) for the ten
-wise comparisons among the five different forest types for each rhyssine species. It is also not clear
e exactly what test was used to compare catches among the different forest types. This should be
ed in the caption to Figure 4 as well as in the text. Alternatively, the authors could dispense with the
-hoc comparisons of catches among forest types and simply report the overall results of the general
ar model that showing the effect of forest type on catch of rhyssine species, and refer the reader to
re 4 to see the relative abundance of each species in Malaise traps set in each forest type.
other beef in regard to stats interpretation is when the authors state more than once:
ut we interpret this as a false negative caused by too low a sample size.” While it may be prudent
aution the reader that ignoring an apparent trend in the data based on a borderline P value may
lt in a type II error, I don’t think you can have it both ways, i.e., accept an inflated p value for making
pe 1 error (by not reducing the comparison-wise error rate), and then dismissing the results when
are near the inflated p value. This could all be avoided by doing away with the post-hoc tests and
enting just the general conclusions from the model. The authors should also acknowledge that one
of sampling is very likely insufficient to draw too many conclusions about habitat associations of
sines, although it is a good start. It would be good to see parallel sampling of wood boring species
, with Fluon-treated Lindgren funnel traps or intercept traps) as well as their parasitoids at the same
to look for associations between both guilds and habitat types, rainfall, etc.
cific comments and editorial comments (page numbers as printed in upper margin of manuscript).
lines 10, 18 Here, and elsewhere “e.g.” should be followed by a comma, i.e., “e.g.,”
line 21 I suggest the “e.g.” and the comma in this sentence be deleted.
line 25 Suggest “We have also published the results of a previous sampling in Uganda,
this sampling that study caught too few…”
line 44 “…different species are to be found, with e.g. e.g., with subfamilies such as…”
line 45 delete “also”
lines12–13 Suggest joining these sentences with a semi-colon” “In general, rhyssines are
to be parasitoids of wood-boring sawfly or beetle larvae [12,16] that prefer humid lowland forests
; dry periods and arid areas seem not to be appear unsuitable [38,39].”
lines 18–19 Suggest “Prior to the present study, For African rhyssines, the situation
re this work is easily summarised: only 30 individuals of African rhyssines were known from the
le of Sub-Saharan Africa ([40], though some further specimens may exist in undetermined museum
ections).”
line 21 “Ecological analyses are impossible with such sample sizes, and, have as far as
know, have not been attempted.”
lines25–28 Replace the dash before “i.e., with a comma, and follow with a comma, i.e.,
re, we describe the ecology of this subfamily. Specifically, we asked how the rhyssine species were
ributed in space and time, i.e., – i.e. how ecological variables such as weather and habitat type
cted the number of rhyssines caught in traps.”
sentence suggests the authors have evidence of cause and effect between weather, habitat type
the numbers of rhyssines captured in traps. I think at this point it would be more prudent to state
associations the authors observed between apparent rhyssine abundance (as measured by trap
hes) and both weather and habitat type. Many factors may affect the capture of rhyssines in traps
ddition to their abundance near the trap, e.g., trap height, trap exposure (i.e., openness to wind and

ributions and compare the goodness of fit with something like Aikaike’s Information Criterion?

ponse to reviewers (RSOS-190913)
e are grateful to the two reviewers for their comments and suggestions, which we have
corporated into the revised manuscript. We address the issues raised by the reviewers in this
sponse. Revisions to the paper have been made as tracked changes.
he main need for revision that the reviewers identified was in how we compared different forest
pes and interpreted these results. Other suggested changes were relatively minor.

wever, I had an issue with the author’s somewhat liberal interpretation of the results of the
istical analyses, specifically regarding differences in catch among the different forest types. For
mple, on page 7, lines 12–13, the authors state “We decided to accept the possibility of false
itive values, and thus did not adjust the probabilities for multiple testing.” This is a very
conventional statement. Most authors make an effort to maintain the experiment-wise error rate
obability of making a type I error) at the conventional 5% level by using a Bonferroni correction
by using post-hoc means tests like the Ryan-Einot Gabriel-Welsh test or Tukey’s. I think it would
more acceptable if the authors were to use a Bonferroni correction for the comparison-wise
or rate (0.05/10 = 0.005) for the ten pair-wise comparisons among the five different forest types
each rhyssine species.
e have rewritten this sentence to make it clearer why we did not correct for multiple testing. The
sue of whether or not to do Bonferroni corrections (or the equivalent) is much discussed. In our
pinion, not doing so is justified in our paper.
he purpose of methods like the Bonferroni correction is to entirely eliminate false positives (type
errors). Their answer to the question "How many false positives are acceptable?" is zero,
respective of the number of tests made.
ur analyses involve a large number of tests (we test six species and four variables, one of which
split into ten pairwise comparisons). If left unadjusted, our results will likely include one or
ore false positives. Applying e.g. a Bonferroni correction, on the other hand, would result in no
lse positives (p<0.05), but would introduce a vast number of false negatives.
our opinion, the first of these options is more desirable in this paper. We prefer to accept a few
lse positives, and bear their presence in mind when interpreting the results, rather than
otentially) obtain no significant results whatsoever.
e have rewritten the sentence to include the above argument, and also to highlight the fact that
e results may contain false positives. We have also toned down our interpretations of these
sults.
also not clear to me exactly what test was used to compare catches among the different forest
es. This should be stated in the caption to Figure 4 as well as in the text.
e have made this clearer in the methods and the caption to Figure 4. The test was the same as for
e other ecological variables (likelihood ratios compared to a null distribution obtained by
sampling). For the forest type, we calculated likelihood ratios pairwise between the forest types.
ernatively, the authors could dispense with the post-hoc comparisons of catches among forest
es and simply report the overall results of the general linear model that showing the effect of
est type on catch of rhyssine species, and refer the reader to Figure 4 to see the relative
ndance of each species in Malaise traps set in each forest type.
e seriously considered this alternative, since it would make the analyses much simpler and
sier to describe to the reader. However, it would also have led to discarding useful information
n the habitat use of the individual species.
other beef in regard to stats interpretation is when the authors state more than once:
but we interpret this as a false negative caused by too low a sample size.” While it may be
dent to caution the reader that ignoring an apparent trend in the data based on a borderline P
ue may result in a type II error, I don’t think you can have it both ways, i.e., accept an inflated p
ue for making a type 1 error (by not reducing the comparison-wise error rate), and then
missing the results when they are near the inflated p value.
oth reviewers raised this issue. We agree, and have deleted these statements.
he purpose of these statements was to highlight results which we had reason to believe are false
egatives. For example, the insignificant E. overlaeti difference between disturbed and swampy
rest (p=0.09, Fig. 4) is likely a false negative. This is because these two forest types respectively
oup with clearcut plantation (p=0.42) and primary forest (p=0.96), yet clearcut and primary
ffer (p<0.05). In other words, these pairwise results are mutually contradictory, and one of them
ust logically be a false positive or negative. The most likely false result is the p=0.09, near-
gnificant result.
owever, this is very hard to phrase clearly. There is also no guarantee that we have correctly
entified which result is false. We thus decided to delete all such statements, and leave any
terpretation of such results to the reader.
, lines 10, 18 Here, and elsewhere “e.g.” should be followed by a comma, i.e., “e.g.,”
, line 21 I suggest the “e.g.” and the comma in this sentence be deleted.
, line 25 Suggest “We have also published the results of a previous sampling in Uganda, but
sampling that study caught too few...”
, line 44 “...different species are to be found, with e.g. e.g., with subfamilies such as...”
, line 45 delete “also”
, lines12–13 Suggest joining these sentences with a semi-colon” “In general, rhyssines
held to be parasitoids of wood-boring sawfly or beetle larvae [12,16] that prefer humid lowland
ests [16]; dry periods and arid areas seem not to be appear unsuitable [38,39].”
, line 21 “Ecological analyses are impossible with such sample sizes, and, have as far as we
w, have not been attempted.”
, line 23 Insert comma after “i.e.”
e have adopted the above suggestions, with the exception of the comma after i.e. and e.g.
lacing a comma after e.g. is a matter of style, with American English strongly favouring the
omma and British English tending to omit it. We have consistently omitted the comma
roughout the paper.
e have also corrected our misuse of "sampling" as a noun (p. 3 line 25) elsewhere in the text,
ecifically in section 4.2.
, lines 18–19 Suggest “Prior to the present study, For African rhyssines, the situation
ore this work is easily summarised: only 30 individuals of African rhyssines were known from
whole of Sub-Saharan Africa ([40], though some further specimens may exist in undetermined
seum collections).”
e have adopted this suggestion in modified form.
, lines25–28 Replace the dash before “i.e., with a comma, and follow with a comma, i.e.,
ere, we describe the ecology of this subfamily. Specifically, we asked how the rhyssine species
e distributed in space and time, i.e., – i.e. how ecological variables such as weather and habitat
e affected the number of rhyssines caught in traps.”
s sentence suggests the authors have evidence of cause and effect between weather, habitat type
the numbers of rhyssines captured in traps. I think at this point it would be more prudent to
e the associations the authors observed between apparent rhyssine abundance (as measured by
p catches) and both weather and habitat type. Many factors may affect the capture of rhyssines
raps in addition to their abundance near the trap, e.g., trap height, trap exposure (i.e., openness
wind and flight corridors), surrounding vegetation, etc.
e have adopted this change (with the exception of the comma after "i.e."), and made it clear we
e looking at associations between rhyssine catches and ecological factors, not direct cause and
fect.
, line 6 Ethanol is known to be emitted in larger quantities of trees under stress, and is also a
ergist for attraction of cerambycid beetles when combined with their aggregation pheromones.
refore, it is conceivable that some rhyssine parasitoids of cerambycid larvae may be attracted to

his is an interesting point, and one we had overlooked! Any effect is likely small since the forest
our study site is full of fruit trees and other stronger sources of ethanol. But we did observe
me taxa (mainly flies) attracted to our traps.
e feel discussing the intricacies of Malaise trapping at this level of detail goes outside the scope
our paper, but will definitely keep this point in mind for future work. We are e.g. planning to
ompare the data of different surveys, and this would be relevant there.
, line 8 The negative binomial is often the best fit for count data but not always – sometimes
oisson or even a Gaussian distribution fit count data better than the negative binomial (e.g., I
e found that species richness per trap is often fit well by the normal distribution). Did you test
er distributions and compare the goodness of fit with something like Aikaike’s Information
terion?
e have added a brief mention of this.
e visually assessed the fit of the Poisson and negative binomial distributions by plotting their
siduals (function plot.manyglm in the R package mvabund). We felt these two distributions to be
e most meaningful for count data.
oth distributions fit the data quite well. We decided on the negative binomial partly because of
s good fit, but also because it is more likely than the Poisson to fit future data for other
bfamilies. We intend to analyse the other Ugandan subfamilies using the same methods as in
is paper, and feel that having the same distribution in each paper would make the analyses more
onsistent.
authors should also acknowledge that one year of sampling is very likely insufficient to draw
many conclusions about habitat associations of rhyssines, although it is a good start. It would
good to see parallel sampling of wood boring species (e.g., with Fluon-treated Lindgren funnel
ps or intercept traps) as well as their parasitoids at the same sites to look for associations
ween both guilds and habitat types, rainfall, etc.
e have added these to the discussion. Parallel sampling of wood-boring species would indeed be
very good next step!

e have removed the "sister paper" from the abstract.

tract. the last line is abit strange, and very specific to Costa Rica/Amazonia (based on senior
hors previous work), but I feel the sentence could be re-worded and made more general, so it
ompasses other studies and for other regions. Arguably greater ecological information for
neumonids is useful for other regions too!
e have made the sentence more general by removing mention of Costa Rica/Amazonia.
owever, in practice the sentence still largely refers to Costa Rica and Amazonia in the context of
e tropics, since these are the only two tropical areas that have been sampled extensively enough.

e thank the reviewer for suggesting these excellent papers, and have cited them as suggested.
his change does not show in tracked changes due to the citation software we use.)
lines 33-47. Much of this paragraph reports on previous papers without a very clear/direct link
the current work. Suggest reduce length and focus Africa/Rhyssinae
e have rewritten parts of the paragraph to make the link to this paper clearer, and deleted some
ss relevant details.
he purpose of this paragraph is to summarise what little was previously known of ichneumonid
henology and habitat use in the tropics. We feel it is worth giving at least some broader context
ropics/Ichneumonidae, not just Africa/Rhyssinae), especially since so little is known of African
yssines.
l2-3 "surrounded by dissimilar vegetation also catching dissimilar ichneumonids.."; this is
fusing to read, can you clarify meaning. Are you saying there is some habitat partitioning of
neumonids?; where different habitats have different assemblages?
e have made this sentence clearer. There was indeed some habitat partitioning: ichneumonid
semblages were associated with the vegetation around traps.
hods - can you clarify the number of sites. you say 9, but there is also 2 on farmland?
e have added a mention of the farmland as a tenth "site" to make this clearer. There were 9 sites
the national park, and 2 traps in farmland outside the park.
line 45 (and others) = you are mentioning an unpublished species name here. Ideally you should
t until the taxonomic revision paper is published
e agree that there would be a case for waiting until the two species names are published.
owever, we cite the current manuscript (especially the sampling methods) in our taxonomic
aper, so there is also a case for getting this manuscript published first. Ideally we would publish
oth simultaneously, but getting two journals to synchronise their publication schedule is likely
ot feasible (although we must confess to having toyed with the idea..).
e feel this is not too much of a problem, since the taxonomy paper is almost certain to appear by
e end of the year (likely sooner), and we are confident that the species names we have selected
pirhyssa quagga and E. johanna) will not change.
lines 1-18. For most species it is mentioned that "probably a false positive caused by low sample
". First, I think this should be mentioned in the discussion, rather than repeat this for each
cies in results. Second, given your year long sampling; how many more samples and specimens
uld be needed to be sure?; you cannot just keep sampling until you get a significant results; and
rd (and most importantly), perhaps that these species are generalists and the type of habitat is
so important, therefore the result is correct.
oth reviewers raised this issue. We agree that these statements go beyond what is supported by
e results, and have deleted them. See response to reviewer 1 for further details.
line 32. sorry but you have NOT clearly demonstrated rhyssines are parasitoids of wood-boring
ects. You have strong support for this, based on your increased catch with decaying wood
uite right! We have corrected the sentence.

ponse to Reviewer 1 (RSOS-190913)
e decided not to adopt the suggestion made by Reviewer 1 for the reasons below. The uploaded
es are thus the same as previously.
iewer 1: The manuscript has been improved from the earlier version. My concerns about false
itives have been adequately dealt with and explained. My only minor comment is one that i had
nded to make in the earlier review but i obviously forgot top do so. It concerns the method the
hors used in Figure 4 to distinguish statistical differences in standardized catches of Rhyssine
cies in different habitat types. I think it would be clearer to readers if the authors used the much
e conventional system of denoting differences between habitats using different letters above the
s. I expect they used this other system as it allows them to specify the actual probabilities, rather
n just those that are less than 0.05. However, if they wish to stick with the way they have done it,
not a major sticking point with me.
e decided not to make this change. Letters above the bars are indeed more conventional, but in
r opinion they are often unclear. We prefer to try our current system in the hope that it will be
sier to interpret (once the reader is accustomed to the system, at least). As the reviewer pointed
t, it also has the advantage of showing actual probabilities. This can help readers interpret figure
in more detail.
