I am a personality researcher and found this article to be very fascinating. However, I did take
slight issue with the framing at the beginning of the intro: the person- and situation-perspective
are today really just straw man positions -- they are not as antithetical as they may seem. And
they are not "part of" social psychology. You could say that there are two psychological
disciplines that have traditionally studied two different and each in their own rights important
determinants of behavior" social psychology was and is interested in situations, and personality
psychology was and is interested in traits. However, it has often been recognized that both traits
and situations interact or transact in complex ways to bring forth behavior. As such, the only
antithesis was actually in how consistent and stable behavior is across situations (person-
situation debate). However, this is not of primary concern to this paper. I would thus suggest to
start with a framing of modern interactionism that acknowledges and emphasizes the dynamic
interplay between person and situation variables. Towards this end, you might literature from
the labs of Funder and Sherman useful. these have also examined how personality states and
characteristics are related. Here are a few:

This manuscript describes a study investigating whether different configurations of face-to-face
interactions (situational factors), as assessed by sociometric badges, predicted transitions between
levels of Big Five personality states. Results were largely consistent with hypotheses predicting
that situational factors would influence personality states in nuanced ways, and that these effects
would differ by personality states. Overall, the paper is well-written, the design and
methodology are rigorous and novel to the fields of social/personality psychology, and the
statistical analyses and interpretation of results are sound. This paper, in my view, will make an
important contribution to the literature on how situational factors relate to within-person
variations in personality. Below, I detail some suggestions that may potentially strengthen the
paper.
1. In the Abstract and on p. 3, the authors talk about personality states as being coined in the
social psychology literature and as being concrete behaviors. I believe that Fleeson is better
known as a personality psychologist, and that personality states reflect the content of behavior (as
described by adjectives), rather than concrete behaviors such as laughing, yelling, etc.
2. If space permits, definitions of adaptation and complementarity would be helpful in the
Abstract.
3. On p. 3, the authors state that Costa & McCrae's model is the "Big Five model," whereas the
term Five Factor Model is technically correct for McCrae & Costa's theoretical model. The "Big
Five" refers more specifically to descriptive taxonomies that have identified five similar traits: see
relevant work by Goldberg, John, Soto, etc.
4. On p. 3, personality states are characterized as behavioral. However, states have all contents of
traits (i.e., affect, behavior, cognition). For example, note the affective terms in the adjectives used
to assess states on p. 5 (e.g., "enthusiastic", "anxious"). See the reference below for more detailed
information regarding the definition of states.
Are fluctuations in personality states more than fluctuations in affect?

5. On pp. 3-4, the authors provide a thorough description of density distribution, however, the
findings from the following article should probably be reviewed as part of this section, as it
describes results of associations between traditional trait measures and characteristics of density
distributions across.
Fleeson, W., & Gallagher, P. (2009). The Implications of Big Five Standing for the Distribution of
Trait Manifestation in Behavior: Fifteen Experience-Sampling Studies and a Meta-Analysis.
Journal of Personality & Social Psychology, 97, 1097-1114.

6. As the focus of the paper is on the density distributions model, it might be nice to include
graphs of density distributions of the Big 5 states in addition to descriptive statistics presented in
Table 1.
7. I understand the rationale for measuring transitions by dichotomizing personality states,
however, I'm not sure that this was an optimal way for measuring changes in personality states.
Some transitions may reflect small changes in states (from just above the median to just below the
median), whereas some non-transitions may involve large changes (maximum score to just above
the median). This question may be due to my lack of familiarity with analyses relying on
graphlets, but could the dependent variables also be operationalized by "increases" or "decreases"
(and "no change") in states above a certain threshold? That is, if a person experienced an increase
by one SD in a particular state, that would count as an "increase." This method might at least
make the different DV options more homogenous in terms of the raw changes in personality
states that they reflect. My sense is that this could increase power to detect effects, but I don't
know if this is feasible with this particular analysis technique.
8. On p. 12, the comparisons of between-person and within-person variation are done by
"eyeballing" the statistics without any statistical tests; perhaps looking at ICC1 values, which
represent the amount of total variance attributable to between-person and within-person
variation, would be more informative here.
9. It might be helpful to include a summary table showing how results for each trait fit with the
different effects (e.g., attraction, inertia, push, repulsion...) found in the study. I believe that this
would serve as a quick reference for the myriad of different effects described in the Results
section and help to organize the discussion.
I wish the researchers best of luck with their continuing investigations.

swer 1: Thanks for pointing out these two issues. We modified the Abstract and p. 3

tes is now the following one: “ … states having the same behavioral, affective, and
nitive content (described by adjectives) as the corresponding trait, but for a shorter
ation …”

pful in the Abstract.
swer 2: We added the definitions of adaptation and complementarity in the Abstract.

del," whereas the term Five Factor Model is technically correct for McCrae & Costa's
oretical model. The "Big Five" refers more specifically to descriptive taxonomies that

luded a brief discussion of this paper and its results."
estion 6: As the focus of the paper is on the density distributions model, it might be

tistics presented in Table 1.
swer 6: We added Figure 1 in the revised version that shows a graph of the density
tribution of the Big Five states.
estion 7: I understand the rationale for measuring transitions by dichotomizing

nges in personality states. Some transitions may reflect small changes in states (from

olve large changes (maximum score to just above the median). This question may be

particular state, that would count as an "increase." This method might at least make
different DV options more homogenous in terms of the raw changes in personality
tes that they reflect. My sense is that this could increase power to detect effects, but I
n't know if this is feasible with this particular analysis technique.
swer 7: We thank the reviewer for the interesting comment. Indeed, several strategies
ld be adopted to discretize a participant's personality state scores. As noted in section
), we employ a sample-based threshold, an approach that brings the advantage of
ng intuitive and easily explainable but bearing the cost of discarding fine-grained
rmation on state transitions at the individual level. On the other hand, if we were to use
erson-based thresholding strategy, the states transition dynamics would not necessarily
consistent at sample-level, therefore posing interpretation issues at sample-level.
netheless, the suggestion of a person-based differential approach is very valuable and
resting, and we plan in future work to investigate its benefits and shortcomings also
hin a sample-based weighting approach.
estion 8: On p. 12, the comparisons of between-person and within-person variation are
ne by "eyeballing" the statistics without any statistical tests; perhaps looking at ICC1
ues, which represent the amount of total variance attributable to between-person and
hin-person variation, would be more informative here.
swer 8: We computed the Intraclass Correlation (ICC1) in order to capture the
