1. How did you adjust the pH of sample solution with 0.01 M HCl and 0.01 M NaOH?
2. I am confused that you selected 120 min as the final contact time? Because the adsorption
efficiency at about 20 min was already the highest. Although the extraction efficiency was
increased about 5%, the equilibrium time consumption could not be ignored.
3. There are some problems in characterizations of the two co-polymers. I am afraid that the C=O
vibration is not centered at 1221 and 1256 cm-1. Also, the pore size around 15.5 and 17.2 nm could
not be defined as mesoporous architecture. So, I think the theory evidence of this work is
insufficient.
4. Now that the title of this part of work placed emphasis on performance evaluation, some
parameters like limit of detection (LOD) and linear range should be included.

ß-cyclodextrin Conjugated Bifunctional Isocyanate Linker Polymer
for Enhanced Removal of 2,4-Dinitrophenol from Environmental
Waters
Dear Editor,
Thank you for your useful comments and suggestions on the language
and structure of our manuscript. We have modified the manuscript
accordingly, and detailed corrections are listed below point by point:
Reviewer 1:
1. How did you adjust the pH of sample solution with 0.01 M HCl and
0.01 M NaOH?
Dear reviewers, the above statement had been revised and new
statement is as below: The initial pH of the solution were adjusted to the
desired values from 2 to 10 either by the addition of HCl or NaOH.
Method:
Known concentration of HCl or NaOH was dropwise into the solution
to achieve the desired pH values using a pH meter.
2. I am confused that you selected 120 min as the final contact time?
Because the adsorption efficiency at about 20 min was already the
highest. Although the extraction efficiency was increased about 5%, the
equilibrium time consumption could not be ignored.
Dear reviewers, thanks for the suggestion given regarding to the effect
of contact time. Even the adsorption efficiency at about 20 min was
already high, however, based on physical observation, both ßCD
polymers at 120 min were totally dispersed well compared to 20 min.
Therefore, in order to achieve a real equilibrium time for the fully
saturation of analytes onto adsorbent, taking consideration 120 min was
an ideal optimization.
3. There are some problems in characterizations of the two co-polymers.
I am afraid that the C=O vibration is not centered at 1221 and 1256 cm-
1
. Also, the pore size around 15.5 and 17.2 nm could not be defined as
mesoporous architecture. So, I think the theory evidence of this work is
insufficient.
Dear reviewers, the peaks at wavenumber 1221 and 1256 cm-1 had been
corrected and was attributed to the C-O-C characteristics of
polyurethane
Based on the definition of International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry (IUPAC), porous materials can be classified into three
categories based on the pore diameters. These are macropores (>50 nm),
mesopores (2–50 nm), and micropores (<2 nm)[1–3].
Since ßCD-TDI and ßCD-HDI possesses a pore size of 15.5 and 17.2
nm, therefore, it is reasonable to well define them as mesoporous
architecture.
4. Now that the title of this part of work placed emphasis on
performance evaluation, some parameters like limit of detection (LOD)
and linear range should be included.
Dear reviewers, the title of the manuscript had been revised based on
the suitability of the content. To the best of our knowledge, most of the
reported removal studies focused only on batch adsorption study,
adsorption kinetic model, adsorption isotherm, and adsorption
thermodynamics. Since this is not an extraction study, parameters such
as limit of detection (LOD) and linear range will not consider as part of
the study.
Reviewer 2:
1. Abstract must be short. It is very long.
Dear reviewers, authors have try the best to provide a short and precise
abstract regarding to our experimental works.
2. English language of paper must be improved.
Dear reviewers, we have revised the whole manuscript carefully by
sending it for English Proofreading Service. Changes are done
according to the attached copy. We believe that the language is now
acceptable for the revision process.
3. According to TGA, temperature around 400-500 for HDA should be
explained.
Dear reviewers, the higher weight loss at around 120 to 480<U+2103> was likely
due to the decomposition of the carbamate groups contributed by the
TDI and HDI cross-linkers attached on ß-CD, respectively; suggesting
the successful preparation of the polymers.
4. Zeta potential for study of pH effect must be reported.
Dear reviewers, in fact, the zeta potential of the polymeric adsorbents at
different pH values is a function of the surface charge. Nonetheless, to
the best knowledge of reviewers, there are still past studies [4–7] have
been reported for the removal of phenolic compounds in aqueous
sample without reporting the zeta potential.
Attached with the citation for your reference and we do hope this will
not be an obstacle for the revision process.
Yours Sincerely,
