PA10T/LGF composite is a relatively new topic, but there are something as follows that needs to
be revised heavily.
1. LGF plays an important role in the composite, and the amount of LGF is a basic parameter to
influence the properties of the composite, so the effect of different amount of LGF should be
shown.
2. The interaction between PA10T and LGF is the base of combining both materials, but little
information is shown about this in the paper. Please add some data in this respect.
3. The English writing is suggested to be carefully modified with the help of someone who is

Comments to the Author(s)
PA10T/LGF composite is a relatively new topic, but there are something as follows
that needs to be revised heavily.
1. LGF plays an important role in the composite, and the amount of LGF is a basic
parameter to influence the properties of the composite, so the effect of different
amount of LGF should be shown.
Answer: Thank you for your comments and suggestion on our manuscript. This point
is taken into account by authors. In this paper, however, we have investigated the
effect of two factors on the composites by changing the aging temperatures and aging
times. If the effect of LGF amount on performance of materials is also considered,
there are too many variables to study the thermal oxidation of the composites.
Furthermore, we mainly focus on the relationship between the internal microstructure
and the macroscopic properties of the composites at different aging time and
temperature scales. Therefore, although the glass fiber content has a great influence
on the macroscopical properties of the composites, it is not the focus of this article. Of
course, whether the glass fiber content will affect the thermal oxygen aging properties
of the composite is a very interesting topic, which will be the next research direction
for our group.
2. The interaction between PA10T and LGF is the base of combining both materials,
but little information is shown about this in the paper. Please add some data in this
respect.
Answer: This point is taken into account by authors. As emphasized by the reviewer
that the interfacial properties of glass fiber and matrix are very important for glass
fiber reinforced composites. In fact, however, there is no proper characterization that
can intuitively express the interaction between fiber and matrix. Therefore, SEM can
only be used in this paper to verify the changes in the interaction between fiber and
matrix before and after aging by observing the apparent morphology or the fracture
morphology after loading of the composites. Then, the effect of thermal oxidation is
explained by comparison, that is, thermal oxidation induces the degradation of the
matrix, which leads to the reduction of the interface area, the attenuation of the
interaction between fiber and matrix and finally interfacial debonding under loading.
In addition, the method of DMA and mechanical properties analysis are used to
indirectly characterize the decay process of the interaction between the fiber and the
matrix in the aging process. For example, as shown in Figs. 4 and 8, the mechanical
properties and the storage modulus of composite gradually decrease with the increase
of aging degree due to deterioration of interface properties. Thanks for your good
comments and suggestion.
3. The English writing is suggested to be carefully modified with the help of someone
who is expert in English. The paper needs to be written more logically and concisely.
Answer: Thank you for your suggestion on our manuscript. We have revised the
manuscript more carefully.
4. Some discussion is lack of the data supporting the statements in Results and
Discussion.
Answer: Thank you for your comments on our manuscript. We will summarize the
conclusion of the article analysis again and add relevant basis.
5. The meaning of f in Equation (8) is not clearly indicated, and the relationship
between Equation (7) and (8) is also not clear, that is, how to get Equation (8) form (7)
is not clear.
Answer: Thank you for your comments and suggestion on our manuscript. It has been
explained that f is the best frequency in the paper. We have added them in the
revision.

If we plug t =1/2pf0 into the Equation (7), we will get the equation as follow:

Reviewer: 2
This work reported that the influence of thermo-oxidative ageing on crystallization,
dynamic and static mechanical properties of LGF reinforced PA 10T composites, and
the crystallization behaviors, dynamic mechanical properties, thermal stability of the
composites were discussed in detail. Some valuable results were obtained. The topic
of the paper is interesting, and it is treated in an acceptable way. The paper is also well
organized. I therefore recommend that this paper can be accepted for publication after
minor revisions.
1. In this work, authors selected 160 and 200oC as investigating aim, the reason
should be addressed.
Answer: Thank you for your comments and suggestion on our manuscript. This
article mainly focuses on the effect of different thermo-oxidative ageing temperature
160 and 200oC on the properties and structure of long glass fiber reinforced PA10T
composites. The properties of PA10T/LGF composites affected with 240oC
thermo-oxidative aging have been discussed in other works of our team, and it is
found that the properties of PA10T/LGF composites at 240oC decrease obviously. And
the long-term use temperature of PA10T in application is over 150oC, so we choose
160 and 200oC as investigating aim to probe on the different aging temperatures on
the properties and structure of PA10T/LGF composites.
2. In Figure 2, it is obviously seen that there are two melting peaks and one
crystallization peak. The reason should be explained.
Answer: The PA10T is a semi-crystalline polymer, the occurrence of double-melting
peaks and single crystallization are caused by recrystallization in annealing. The
double-melting peaks could be ascribed to that a portion of crystals form more
complete and thicker wafers and others produce more irregular and smaller wafers
during melt-quenching process. At the same time, the degradation of molecular chains
also causes the formation of small molecular and small molecule is prone to form
perfect wafers, inducing the form of double-melting peaks. And samples should be
annealed before melting or cool slowly, the samples have been fully crystallized,
leading to appear to be a crystallization peak. We have revised and added them in our
revision.
3. In Figure 6, the charred residues of polymer composites after aging increased, and
the weight also increased with increasing the aging temperature. Why?
Answer: Thank you for your good comments on our manuscript. Thermal-oxidative
aging PA10T/LGF composites bring about the degradation of matrix and form high
degree of carbonization, showing a relatively high thermal stability. The glass fiber
and the carbon layer formed on the surface of composites during thermo-oxidative
aging can effectively prevent the fabrication of inorganic additives and the carriages
of volatiles, and thus reduce the heat release speed and weight loss rate during thermal
decomposition process, inducing increasing charred residues and weight of polymer
with the aging temperature and time enhancing.
4. The influence of aging temperature on the mechanical properties of reinforced
composites is outstanding. Authors should address the reasons in detail.
Answer: Thank you for your comments and suggestion on our manuscript. The
degradation of the composites, the decrease of intermolecular interaction and the
reduction of molecular weight all lead to the decline of mechanical properties of
PA10T/LGF composites with the aging temperature increasing. Some more analysis
of oxidation and reasons have been added in this revised manuscript.
5. Some English language should be improved. Some incorrect description should be
corrected in following revision. Such as: Equation (1), (5), (6) is not clear, please
correct it; in Page 22 line 35, the first “the” ought to be deleted; in Page 22 line 46-53,
the meaning of this sentence is not clear.
Answer: Thank you for your comments and suggestion on our manuscript. We have
revised the manuscript more carefully.
6. In Abstract, the DSC results could prove the crystallization and melting behavior of
degraded PA10T/LGF composites occurred changes, they couldn’t indicate which
ways led to those changes and how to affect.
Answer: Thank you for your comments and suggestion on our manuscript. It has been
added in this revised abstract.
7. How to prove the break of the molecular chains and the destruction of
crystallization structure?
Answer: It is difficult for PA10T/LGF composites to measure molecular weight by
GPC owing to the poor solubility. So, we can reflect indirectly the break of molecular
chains and crosslinking of molecular chains. From Figure 8, the decline of the
mechanical properties is attributed to interface debonding owing to the break of the
molecular chains and the destruction of crystallization structure during the
thermal-oxidative aging process. From SEM, it is found that small particles are
absorbed in the surface of the matrix with unaged samples because of the break of
molecular chains. From DSC curves, small molecules caused by the break of the
molecular chains and the destruction of crystallization structure, as nucleating agent,
induce recrystallization, inducing slightly the increase of melting temperature.
8. What kind of effect of the thermo-oxidative aging of composites is caused by
reducing of the interfacial bonding between the glass fiber and PA10T matrix based
on DMA data?
Answer: The storage modulus of the composite gradually decreases with increasing
the aging degree due to thermo-oxidative aging effect. When it comes to elevated
aging time, the integrated region of PA10T/LGF composites affected with
thermo-oxidative aging takes place grievous destruction, invoking gap existing in
molecule and molecule and the reduction of the interfacial bonding between the glass
fiber and PA10T matrix. Because of the degradation of materials and the formation of
small molecules resulting from thermo-oxidative aging effect, the interfacial bonding
between glass fiber and PA10T matrix decreases and internal friction weakens,
obtaining the result that the loss modulus of the multiple system gradually drops.
