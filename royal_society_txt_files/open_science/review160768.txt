Comments to the Author(s)

Authors used a kinetic modeling approach coupled with dynamical systems theory and microbial
genomics to address an important issue. The results indicated that the biochemical network holds
inherent adaptive capacity to stabilize ammonium and nitrate availability, and that the bistability
in the formation of ammonium is linked to the transient upregulation of the amo-hao mediated
nitrification pathway. The topic is interesting and the analysis is well presented. I would like to
recommend its publication after authors carefully address the following points:
1. Compared to the existing methods and results, authors should elaborate the motivations and
main contribution of this paper in a more clearly way.
2. More descriptions for Fig.1 should be provided.
3.All the parameters used in the analysis should be clearly explained.
4. This study uses the complex network theory. An introduction of complex network is welcome,
e.g., Scientific Reports, 6, 35622, 2016; Scientific Reports, 5: 8222, 2015; Experimental Thermal and
Fluid Science, 60: 157-164, 2015.
5. As a further work, I suggest authors to consider more network measures to analyze the derived
nitrogen biochemical network, e.g., the clustering coefficient entropy(Europhysics Letters, 109:
30005, 2015) and more interesting results are expected.

The authors of this manuscript have shown how belowground nitrogen microbial pathways
regulate bioavailability of ammonium and nitrate forms in fluctuating soil redox conditions. With
3
the use of interesting advanced mathematical tools, the study identifies circuitry structure that
alternatively functions for stabilizing and maintaining bioavailable nitrogen forms, which is an
original result and has not been described previously. I, therefore, recommend following minor
corrections before it goes for the publication:
1. I think that abstract can be improved by briefly mentioning specific results of source and sink
type wiring structure and its functions.
2. Number of current references is limited. It will be good to see more recent supporting
references.
3. Discussion section can easily be shorten by removing some irrelevant stuffs (see the paragraph
line no. 462-505)
4. Table 2 looks very odd in the main text, as it has not been listed any important specific
information. It can be moved to supporting materials.
5. Table S2 (Definition and measuring units of model variables and parameters) can be moved to
main text from the supporting materials.

Compared to the existing methods and results, authors should elaborate the motivations and

Thank you for reading our manuscript and giving your comments.
We have added a small portion in the introduction section with two important references
which clearly indicates our overarching goal and the specific issue that we have addressed,
and the related results obtained in this paper.
“…….Accelerated human activity during the past century has doubled the annual transfer of
nitrogen from unavailable atmospheric pool to the biologically available forms (Meunier et al.
2016). The major source of this supply includes heavy use of nitrogen fertilizers, and the
combustion of fossil fuels. How it affects terrestrial ecosystems, which are mostly nitrogen
limited, is poorly understood. In order to address this broad question, it will be important to
know how the nitrogen cycle responses to these changes and maintain its core cycling process
(Bernal et al. 2012)……...”

More descriptions for Fig.1 should be provided.
Reply:
We have changed the figure caption and included a brief description of the connection among
different microbial pathways.
“---------Figure 1: A nitrogen biochemical network constructed with the use of KEGG
nitrogen metabolism database. It consists of interconnected biogeochemical pathways
(Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), Assimilatory nitrate reduction,
Denitrification, Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), Nitrification and Anammox) serving to
biochemically process nitrogenous metabolites and transfer them to next reaction in the
network, with the network deficiency zero. There are a variety of genes encoding enzymes
that catalyze the important transformation reactions of various nitrogen forms ranging from
the oxidation states +5 in nitrate to -3 in ammonium. The ammonium and nitrite act as the
network hubs, connecting relatively maximum number of reactions either as substrate or
product of the biochemical reactions…………..”
3. Reviewer’s comment:
All the parameters used in the analysis should be clearly explained.
Reply:
We have added Table 2 in the main text which includes definition and physical units of all
parameters and variables of the biochemical model.
4. Reviewer’s comment:
This study uses the complex network theory. An introduction of complex network is welcome,
e.g., Scientific Reports, 6, 35622, 2016; Scientific Reports, 5: 8222, 2015; Experimental
Thermal and Fluid Science, 60: 157-164, 2015.
Reply:
Thank you for your comments. We have added a brief introduction for application of
complex network theory in the second paragraph of the introduction section, with all the
relevant references you have mentioned in your comments.
5. Reviewer’s comment:
As a further work, I suggest authors to consider more network measures to analyze the
derived nitrogen biochemical network, e.g., the clustering coefficient entropy (Europhysics
Letters, 109: 30005, 2015) and more interesting results are expected.
Reply:
Thank you for your suggestion. Application of advanced network theory and related
measures will certainly be beneficial for deeper understanding of this system. Our

1. Reviewer’s comment:
I think that abstract can be improved by briefly mentioning specific results of source and sink
type wiring structure and its functions.
Reply:
Thank you for reading our manuscript and giving your comments and suggestions. We have
revised the abstract by including the following sentences:
“----The bistability is maintained by a pair of complementary subsystems acting as either
source or sink type systems in response to soil redox fluctuations…….”
2. Reviewer’s comment:
Number of current references is limited. It will be good to see more recent supporting
references.
