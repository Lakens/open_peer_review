Comments to the Author(s)

This is a commentary on the article “Scratch that itch (…)” by Duboscq et al. 2016 also in RSOS.
The authors of the commentary rightfully point out that different stressors may act at different
time frames triggering self-directed behaviours, especially scratching, for different reasons in
different contexts. They point out that the original analysis did not take into account such
different time frames that would allow separating the effects of acute and chronic stressors on
self-directed behaviours and thus that the original study might fail to really explain the
occurrence of self-directed behaviours despite an integrative analysis testing all kind of factors.
They also assess that the different hypotheses are not “alternative hypotheses” but agree that “if
concurrently present [different factors] can have a combined action on the behavioural response”.
The commentary is insightful and the discussion is welcome. There are some approximations or
incorrect assumptions though that may need to be acknowledged or even corrected. In the
following review, I thus make 2 kinds of comments, the first list only constitutes comments or
suggestions that the authors can take into account or ignore as they wish. These comments will
also be part of a response if my co-authors and I get the opportunity to write one. The other list of
comments consists of things I would advise to modify, but again I leave it at the discretion of the
authors and the editor.
Comments:
1/ I would say that in general, at the level of the aggregate data set, the hypotheses are non-
mutually exclusive in explaining general scratching patterns. However, at the level of an
individual scratching event, each of the hypothesis is more likely to be acting independently. A
single scratch may be caused by x, y, or z, but it seems less likely that it would occur because of
all three. So the use of the term “alternative” is not necessarily incorrect.
2/ the authors state, lines 71-74, that "The variation observed between time t0 and t1 cannot be
linked to parasitological factors if the ectoparasite load is not significantly different between t0
and t1. There is no reason to believe that, in the absence of any other additional perturbing factor,
the ectoparasite load varies significantly in the minutes immediately preceding and following the
stressful event." While I agree with the final part, the premise is incorrect because louse-induced
itch could depend in the long-term on louse load and in the short-term on louse activity. So even
with the same load, two individuals might experience different reactions depending on the
current activity level of individual lice on their bodies. The variation in self-directed behaviours
between t0 and t1 can therefore be linked to parasitological factors even within minutes. This
short-term variation might also be linked to environmental factors as louse activity is responsive
to temperature, humidity, or even solar radiation [James et al. 1998; Murray 1960a&b, 1963a&b]
so that a sudden change in these parameters might impact louse activity quickly. A sudden
change in these parameters might also directly impact the occurrence of self-directed behaviour if
it creates disturbances in the hair/pelage/skin of the animals.
Suggestions of changes:
1/ lines 20-21: I don't think this statement does justice to the original article and would suggest to
rephrase. The authors of the original article did include a lot of other factors and make a point at
testing them all, either separately or together, in order to examine equitably a full range of
hypotheses.
2/ lines 47-52: I think the first statement is incorrect because the links between self-directed
behaviours, and particularly scratching, with social, environmental and parasitological factors
cannot be considered as fully validated, especially the links between self-directed behaviours and
parasitological factors and especially in nonhuman primates. This is in itself the justification of
the original study, that the investigation of this link is often ignored in primate studies. Maybe
the authors could tone down that part or phrase it differently?
3/ line 71: the authors reference a study (Duboscq et al. 2014 - by the same first author as the
original study by the way) to illustrate the importance of using temporal analyses to understand
3
the effect of A on B. Although the example is spot on, the reference is ill chosen because a/ the
study uses a different method than the method the authors refer to (that is Duboscq et al 2014 do
not compare PC-MC frequencies but baseline-PC) and b/ the study actually finds that scratching
does not increase after an aggression but has even the tendency to be lower than baseline, hence it
is a counterexample of “anxiety” rising after a stressful event. I suggest the authors use a more
appropriate reference.

In this brief commentary, the authors discuss Duboscq et al. (2017)’s paper on whether social,
environmental or parasitological factors influence self-directed behaviors in Japanese macaques.
Norscia and Palagi, in particular, suggest that Duboscq et al. failed to recognize the importance of
considering that different factors can exert their effect on self-scratching rates on different time
scales. Overall, I think that Norscia and Palagi raise an important point, and I believe that their
commentary is well written and would be an important contribution to the discussion on what
factors increase animal anxiety levels.
I have only some minor comments:
Line 19: Add the common name (Japanese macaque) before the scientific name of the species
Lines 19-20: both here and in all others parts of the commentary where the authors quote some
sentences from Duboscq et al.’ s paper, I would add the page number where the quotation is
located, so that readers can more easily refer to the original paper.
I think the end of the second paragraph (Lines 44-48) would benefit from a wider variety of
citations: the authors point out that in New World monkeys and lemurs variation in scratching
rates have been linked to different stressful events, but they only cite their own work on lemurs. I
think they should cite also some work done in New World monkeys too. Furthermore, they do
not mention that a link between stressful events and scratching rates has been shown in apes too

mments:
would say that in general, at the level of the aggregate data set, the hypotheses are non-mutually
lusive in explaining general scratching patterns. However, at the level of an individual
atching event, each of the hypothesis is more likely to be acting independently. A single scratch
y be caused by x, y, or z, but it seems less likely that it would occur because of all three. So the
of the term “alternative” is not necessarily incorrect.
SWER: the authors did not make a distinction between aggregate data and individual scratching
nt, even because the way data are considered cannot be part of a theoretical assumption. We
used on the distinction between chronic or acute stress (long lasting/transient) to integrate the
mework. We also wanted to point out that there is an apparent inconsistency in the way the
othesis are considered (alternative or non-mutually exclusive) but that we agree with the authors
en they state that they are non-mutually exclusive. More in general, when examining the causes
a phenomenon, we do not think that the causes can switch from being alternative or not
ending on the methodology used to analyse data (single datum versus aggregated data). What
y change is the likelihood of unveiling a certain underlying mechanism (if the analytical
roach is not appropriate, one may conclude that a mechanism does not exist whereas, in fact, the
hod does not allow the underlying mechanism to come to the surface). In the commentary we
about the factors that can affect scratching. They can be either alternative or not. In case of two
rnative factors, if factor A causes scratching than factor B does not cause it. Alternative
otheses are mutually exclusive: if A happens, B cannot happen and vice versa. It is either A or
If A and B can happen together depending on the situation, A and B are not alternative.
arding the example of the reviewer, a single scratch may be caused by x+y (e.g. later on the
iewer points out that a variation of environmental conditions (factor 1) can lead to a change in
parasite activity (factor 2), leading to scratching variation). If I get scared and at the same time
asites move around because I start shaking, my scratching might be caused by two factors. It is
ikely but possible. So, in our opinion, the hypotheses related to such factors cannot be, from a
oretical perspective, considered as alternative.
he authors state, lines 71-74, that "The variation observed between time t0 and t1 cannot be
ed to parasitological factors if the ectoparasite load is not significantly different between t0 and
There is no reason to believe that, in the absence of any other additional perturbing factor, the
oparasite load varies significantly in the minutes immediately preceding and following the
ssful event." While I agree with the final part, the premise is incorrect because louse-induced
could depend in the long-term on louse load and in the short-term on louse activity. So even
h the same load, two individuals might experience different reactions depending on the current
vity level of individual lice on their bodies. The variation in self-directed behaviours between t0
t1 can therefore be linked to parasitological factors even within minutes. This short-term
iation might also be linked to environmental factors as louse activity is responsive to
perature, humidity, or even solar radiation [James et al. 1998; Murray 1960a&b, 1963a&b] so
se parameters might also directly impact the occurrence of self-directed behaviour if it creates
urbances in the hair/pelage/skin of the animals.
SWER: We rephrased so to be specific for parasite load. This is the aspect tested by Duboscq et
the authors do not check for parasite activity, which is very difficult). We used the interesting
ark of the reviewer and also added a sentence acknowledging that parasite activity may change
the short term and that another type of study design would be necessary to investigate the
nomenon. This study design should include a temporal analysis. A point that we do not address
he commentary, because it would divert the attention from the main focus of the commentary is
definition of short term. In the short term temperature, humidity and solar radiation can
matically change, cause a change in parasite activity and eventually lead to scratching. This can
eed happen in the short time (if compared to days of continuous parasite load) but maybe not as
rt as the time of reaction to a sudden event can be (scratching can increase within 1 minute from
perturbing even). Hence it would be interesting to define the “short term”: less than 1 minute?
s than five minutes?). We thank the reviewer for giving us the opportunity to reflect on this
resting aspect.
gestions of changes:
ines 20-21: I don't think this statement does justice to the original article and would suggest to
hrase. The authors of the original article did include a lot of other factors and make a point at
ing them all, either separately or together, in order to examine equitably a full range of
otheses.
SWER: here we wanted to summarise the conclusions of the paper, not the entire paper, to go
ight to the point. There is a primary cause for scratching and possibly secondary causes. Our
nt here was to say that the authors themselves, although identifying a primary cause for
atching, do not exclude that other factors can play a role in producing scratching. This helped us
build a joint argument that expands, but does not contradicts, the authors’ framework: being
mary’ and ‘secondary’ depends on the time frame. However, we added a sentence and rephrased
void misunderstandings.
ines 47-52: I think the first statement is incorrect because the links between self-directed
aviours, and particularly scratching, with social, environmental and parasitological factors
not be considered as fully validated, especially the links between self-directed behaviours and
asitological factors and especially in nonhuman primates. This is in itself the justification of the
inal study, that the investigation of this link is often ignored in primate studies. Maybe the
hors could tone down that part or phrase it differently?
SWER: We rephrased and made it clearer that what we wanted to say is that at present there is
ugh evidence to say that the hypotheses on the relationship between certain factors and
atching cannot be considered as just hypotheses anymore. While it can be certainly debated how
when different factors can relatively influence scratching, the existence of a relationship
ween such factors and scratching has been demonstrated. Because this is a short commentary, we
y included a selection of the available literature. We never questioned the reason why the study
set up even because we think that this study is very valuable. We just point out that the question
ing can add to the theoretical framework.
ine 71: the authors reference a study (Duboscq et al. 2014 - by the same first author as the
inal study by the way) to illustrate the importance of using temporal analyses to understand the
ct of A on B. Although the example is spot on, the reference is ill chosen because a/ the study
s a different method than the method the authors refer to (that is Duboscq et al 2014 do not
pare PC-MC frequencies but baseline-PC) and b/ the study actually finds that scratching does
increase after an aggression but has even the tendency to be lower than baseline, hence it is a
nterexample of “anxiety” rising after a stressful event. I suggest the authors use a more
ropriate reference.
SWER: we changed the word “increase” with “variation” at the beginning of the paragraph to
id the risk of misinterpretation. In the previous version it may be indeed implied that the cited
rk found a scratching increase. We do not think that the citation is misplaced or inappropriate
e. We cited a work of the same author as the article which we comment upon on purpose. We
not cite it because of its results, which are not relevant here. The fact that Duboscq et al’s
14) did not compare PC-MC but baseline-PC is not a problem. Match Control (MC) and Post-
nflict (PC) focals are never done in a sequential way. However, to carry out PCs the authors had
heck what happened in the minutes right after a specific event, which is a temporal analysis.
nce, the work is cited to acknowledge that the same author has used a temporal analysis when
med necessary. This is part of the way we chose to elaborate the commentary. We think that it is
ticularly constructive to find support in the authors’ work to build a joint, comprehensive
mework by drawing from both their and our theoretical assumptions.

similarities with human scratching should be added as scratching is highly associated with
ss and also social aspects such contagious scratching that is more robust in patients with
erlying chronic itch
SWER: reference to humans was included (the citation was already there) and it would be very
resting to address the issue of contagious scratching related to chronic itch but we are afraid that
may divert the focus from the main topic of the commentary.
writing is unclear in several parts for example " it is worth focusing on the agency??? of each
or in relation to the time scale. There is too much repetition.
SWER: the wording was changed.
oming could easily be differentiated from scratching as the movements differ.
SWER: we focused on scratching because this is the behaviour that is clearly associated with
iety. Grooming has also many other functions (social cement, toileting, service give in exchange
emale access or tolerance by dominants etc) and its relationship with certain factors is difficult
e singled out.

SWER: added
es 19-20: both here and in all others parts of the commentary where the authors quote some
tences from Duboscq et al.’ s paper, I would add the page number where the quotation is located,
hat readers can more easily refer to the original paper.
SWER: added
ink the end of the second paragraph (Lines 44-48) would benefit from a wider variety of
tions: the authors point out that in New World monkeys and lemurs variation in scratching rates
e been linked to different stressful events, but they only cite their own work on lemurs. I think
y should cite also some work done in New World monkeys too. Furthermore, they do not
ntion that a link between stressful events and scratching rates has been shown in apes too (e.g.
ser, O. N., Stahl, D., & Aureli, F. (2008). Stress reduction through consolation in chimpanzees.
ceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 105(25), 8557-8562).
SWER: one of the works that we cited was about a study that we did on New World Monkeys
species is Callithrix jacchus). We added two citations on apes (including the one suggested)
another on New World Monkeys to provide broader perspective on the topic.
