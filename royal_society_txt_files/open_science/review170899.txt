Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
This paper marks an attempt to establish the pattern of morphological diversity (disparity) in
turtles over the past c. 200 million years (a laudable aim) as well as ascertain the major driving
forces behind this pattern (climate, extinction, biogeography). Specifically the authors attempt to
establish whether an apparent depression in disparity in the past 20 million years can be removed
by applying a phylogenetic "correction" to their data (based on work by Friedman 2009 and
Wilberg 2017, both cited by the authors). The manuscript is arguably presented primarily as an
addendum to Foth and Joyce (2016, also already cited by the authors), however as a reviewer I
will treat it as any paper should be, i.e., a stand alone publication. This is important as I feel that
the work commits a number of errors, some of which are novel to the current manuscript, but
others of which are carried over from the original work (and hence could - and hence should - be
corrected or amended here). I provide both major and minor comments that I hope the authors
can use to improve their manuscript below.
My major issues with the paper can be summarised in the following eight points:
1) The authors do not establish a specific hypothesis to test (simple correlations with a single
climate proxy are applied, but are shown to be essentially a poor explanation for their data) and
yet conclude (without evidence) both that extinction is not, and biogeography is, a major driving
factor in their evolution. Hypotheses should be established at the outset and numerical means by
which they can be tested (or falsified) explained and any subsequent results explicitly shown,
whether through tables or graphs. Reference to the previous paper (Foth and Joyce 2016) is
insufficient as they have established a novel time series and hence their results have substantially
altered (additionally this should serve as a stand alone publication, see above).
2) Crucially the authors do not establish that their metric really captures the signal
(morphological diversity) they are looking for. I.e., I believe that they are actually primarily
measuring phylogenetic disparity over time - Figure 1a shows that phylogenetic interpolation
dominates their data, not empirical morphological observations and a likely expectation of
phylogenetic interpolations is an artifactually smoother curve: exactly what they find (Figure 1b
and 1c, solid lines exhibit lower volatility than dashed). However, the authors do not properly
explore this interpretation.
3) The authors appear to be misapply the method (Friedman 2009) that they are using. I.e., they
appear to be including both terminal node (observation data) with both interpolated internal
node *and* branch data. This is not the intention of the Friedman method (see his Figure 1). (NB: I
am inferring this from Figure 1a as the authors offer insufficient explanation and no R code is
provided.) In effect this means lineages will be double counted (i.e., a mid-branch value can be
included with one or more end-branch values - terminal or internal nodes). This will lead to both
greater dominance of phylogenetic interpolations over empirical observations (evident in Figure
1a) - eyeballing the data shows this is well over 50% - and further exacerbate the problem above
(i.e., an over-smoothed curve that really primarily represents phylogenetic disparity and not
morphological diversity.
4) The authors additionally misapply the method of Friedman (2009) by not applying both his
"punctuated" *and* "gradual" approaches. They do not justify why they only chose to use the
gradual approach. This is also an additional source of uncertainty they fail to characterise (see
below).
5) The authors critically fail to establish an expected pattern for their data by which it can be
properly interpreted - currently they only briefly note that their data do not appear to fit a model
of "early high" disparity. A crucial reference here is Foote (1996) on "Models of morphological
3
diversification" where he establishes a series of expectations for how disparity and taxonomic
richness will change over time under a set of simple models. NB: the authors could easily
compare their data to these models to help begin to interpret it correctly using the phylogenetic
hypothesis (lineages through time) as their richness proxy. This would greatly aid placing the
observed pattern on a sounder footing and should be considered as a potential explanation of
their data quite different to both the (already weak) climate proxy (see above) or biogeography
(never established with actual data in the present contribution).
6) Extending this point further the authors could, and should, use their phylogenetic hypothesis
to simulate morphology under simple models (e.g., Brownian Motion) and measure the resulting
disparity patterns under the same protocols to more correctly establish an expected pattern of
morphological diversity which they can compare their actual empirical data to.
7) The authors also appear to misunderstand how sampling biases operate and potential shape
their data. Specifically the paper focuses on a single short window where a depression in
disparity is attributed solely to sampling bias. This is problematic as sampling bias can operate in
both directions - high sampling can just as easily explain high disparity - and there are other
points in their time series where the number of observations are just as low if not lower (Figure
1a). However, it does not appear that a correlation between N observations and disparity exists
(by eyeballing the data - NB: without the raw data I was unable to conduct analyses of my own).
Furthermore, sampling issues should really be tackled using a subsampling approach (if this is
the authors true aim) and not phylogenetic interpolation (which can simply introduce it's own
biases - see comments above). Specifically I would urge the authors to explore techniques like
that outlined in Kotric and Knoll (2015; Paleobiology, 41, 68-).
8) Finally, the authors assume at every step of their protocol that their data is both precise and
accurate, or to put it more simply there is an alarming lack of confidence intervals anywhere in
their results. Specifically, they treat their phylogeny as perfectly known, they treat their tip ages
as perfectly known, they treat all divergence times as perfectly known, they treat their ancestral
reconstructions as perfectly known etc. All of these are more accurately treated as sources of error
that should (and can be) easily modelled in their data and the resulting effects used to establish
the robustness of their pattern. For example, a sample of phylogenetic hypotheses reflecting the
uncertainty in their relationships could be used, tip ages could be randomly sampled from
uniform distributions between their first and last appearance datum, divergence estimates could
be sampled from the full distributions (not just the median), the uncertainty in ancestral
reconstruction values could be reported instead of just the point estimate used, Without these
steps it is impossible to know how robust the apparent pattern is and hence any interpretations of
it are potentially seriously undermined.
I list some other more minor suggestions below:
- The authors should use K-Pg not K-T as it maintains parity in geologic time-scale "rank", i.e.,
Period-Period.
- "which quantifies morphological diversity as opposed to taxonomic diversity" This is
misleading as both richness and disparity are biodiversity metrics, but only two of a much larger
suite (e.g., evenness, functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity). I.e., the authors are
characterising them as the only two options. Suggest rewording.
- The authors do not establish why they are using 2D data and not 3D. If they have three separate
views then xyz landmarks could be established without the need to choose a single view that
captures the most variance (i.e., they could just capture *all* variance). On a similar note the
authors should be careful to use cranial disparity throughout the manuscript as they cannot
establish the pattern from postcranial disparity or indeed whole organism disparity with their
data. Alternatively a sentence establishing that they only mean cranial disparity when using
"disparity" later should be inserted at an early stage. This avoids the danger of over-interpreting a
single portion of the skeleton as explaining the entire morphological diversity of the clade.
- An additional sensitivity test the authors should consider is the effects on the disparity time
4
series by removing specific taxa. In other words, what effect do outliers have on the data? This
can help them empirically get at the issue they raise themselves in the discussion - i.e.,
morphologically diverse but incomplete specimens are already excluded and some taxon ranges
are truncated based on additional analysis of the turtle fossil record. This approach could
simulate empirically what kinds of effects this issue can be expected to have, greatly
strengthening any conclusions made.
- The notion that the authors approach "fully addresses the sampling issue" is obviously incorrect
as it is patently impossible for any of us to ever achieve this! Suggest omitting.
- "We furthermore restricted our analysis by excluding Eunontosaurus africanus (Late Permian)
and Pappochelys rosinae (Middle Triassic) as both taxa fall far outside the time binning scheme
relevant to true turtles (Testudinata)". At what stage in the analysis are these taxa excluded? I.e., I
would strongly suggest they be included initially for two reasons: 1) they are key taxa for time-
scaling the phylogenetic hypothesis, and 2) they are also likely to be key taxa for establishing
accurate ancestral reconstructions. If not already I strongly encourage the authors to only omit
the taxa *after* these two steps have been completed in their protocol.
- "We finally recalibrated our supertree using the R package paleotree 2.7" The authors need to
provide more information here. I assume by "recalibrated" they actually mean they time-scaled
their phylogeny, and further that these branch-lengths (millions of years) are the ones used to
perform the ancestral reconstructions. However, they should be more explicit on what functions
were used as well as provide as supporting information or a Dryad upload their raw data and
code (see below).
- The authors use sum of variances as their disparity metric throughout, but many possible
metrics exist. The authors should minimally explain this choice, and ideally establish that their
pattern is robust to other (potentially just as valid) choices. For example, sum or product of
ranges, product of variances, mean pairwise distance, hypercubic volume, hyperellipsoid volume
etc.
- The authors state that to "estimate the degree of significance of disparity differences between
adjacent time bins, a shuffle test was conducted with 10,000 replicates" I have no idea what a
"shuffle test" is, nor are these results visualised in the sole figure. Some explanation/visualisation
would greatly aid understanding here.
- The authors state that they "tested for a correlation between disparity and climate", but do not
delineate how they solved the great difficulties in comparing time series that were constructed in
such drastically different manners. For example, these need to be first placed within the same
scheme (e.g., a single system of instantaneous time-slices/point estimates, a series of within-bin
values, moving averages, parameter values from some complex function fitted to the data etc.)
and other major issues need to be dealt with such as temporal autocorrelation, non-stationarity of
time series, heteroscedacity of data etc. This is not a simple matter and the choices made will
undoubtedly lead to different outcomes - potentially drastically so. There is no easy or clear
answer here, but the authors should minimally fully explain the approach they used here.
- The authors state that "this clade is not affected by the K/T extinction", but this should be
interpreted in the context of some external frame of reference. For example, was there a major
taxonomic richness loss here? Was the clade in question selectively effected by comparison to
other turtle clades? Was there a loss of morphological outlier taxa? If the answers are all no then
why would we expect any effect in disparity anyway?
- Examination of the tree file provided shows that it is not fully resolved (bifurcating) as there are
only 135 internal nodes and 144 terminal nodes (a fully resolved rooted tree would have N - 1
internal nodes, i.e., 143). Assuming that these polytomies represent phylogenetic uncertainty the
authors should address how treating soft polytomies as hard (as seems to be implied without
further methodological details) might bias their results. (See also the major comment regarding
unquantified uncertainties above.)
- That Table S2 indicates no significant bin-to-bin changes (at an alpha of 0.05) in turtle disparity
deserves far more comment than it currently receives. I strongly suspect this is the result of
introducing phylogenetic bias into their data, smoothing out any volatility (see comments above),
but if not then this is a remarkable outcome for a clade over such a long period. Why should
turtles be able to maintain such apparently great morphological stability?
- "Pan-cryptodires see a notable dip in disparity following the K/T extinction event, mostly likely
5
due to the loss of various often bizarre marine lineages (e.g., protostegids, sandowniids, etc.)"
There should be no "likely" here as the authors have the data to know. Which is it?
- "in particular testudinoids and chelydroids, that expanded into the habitats left vacated by more
basal groups that went extinct" Are they also expanding into the same areas of the ordination
space? Or are they new areas? If the latter are they still ecologically similar? What does this mean
for interpreting the ordination space?
- "Pan-pleurodire disparity suffers a similar loss during the late Paleogene, again probably due to
the loss of marine adapted lineages at that time (e.g., bothremydids, stereogenyines, etc.)" Again,
the authors have the data to make a definitive statement here, there should be no "probably".
- "Interestingly, although pleurodires only represent about a quarter of all extant turtles [32], their
sum of variance, a disparity measure that takes diversity into account, is greater than that of
cryptodires" This is interesting. I would urge the authors to expand this point further. Was this a
surprise? What can we tell from visual inspection of their crania? Are they also ecologically
diverse? Functionally? Phylogenetically? If not what explains this pattern?
- The authors state that "the Miocene dip in the cranial disparity curves of turtles we retrieved in
our original study [6] turns out to be a gap in the fossil record rather than a natural event" It
seems to me that this statement could be made without any statistical analysis, or explained by
the absence of lineages known to be present due to their existence both before and after this time.
I.e., what are the authors really doing here? (See major comments above.)
- "the new analyse" should be "analysis".
- The only supplementary data is a tree with branch-lengths. Where is the morphological data?
What about the R code? The divergence estimates used? The tip ages used?
- The figures could be improved substantially. For example, the authors could add a proper
geologic time-scale to their x-axes in Figure 1 (for example, using the geoscale package in R).
Similarly there is no visible asterisk on the plot to demarcate the Miocene dip as claimed in the
caption. Major extinction events should also be delineated on the time series to highlight their
effects (or their absence).
- An additional figure showing the correlation data would also be helpful. Biogeographic data
should also be shown visually as far as possible if this is truly considered the explanatory factor
(but see major comments above).

Comments to the Author(s)

The paper is a short update on a previous study of morphological disparity as described from
turtle cranial shape across lineages through time. The authors recognise a shortcoming in their
previous paper and have used a recently proposed method to examine it. Specifically that there
might be a sampling issue in their data influencing the estimated disparity curve. The solution is
to use a method proposed by Wilberg (2017, Zool J Linn Soc) that builds upon a method by
Brusatte et al. (2011 Paleobiology), whereby ancestral state reconstructions are made by squared-
change parsimony, and those are included in the time bins in which the phylogenetic hypothesis
predicts they would be found. The method is using this phylogenetic approach to boast sample
sizes. Wilberg states that the method “acts to smooth the data by ‘filling in’ time periods with
poor sampling.”
I have no issues with the way the authors have implemented the test – although it puzzles me as
to why only a subset of the variables were used and not the whole shape space, since the methods
being used here do not have multivariate restrictions (but this is not relevant here as they are
simply following their previously published study).
My only concern is that branch length interpolations, and the ancestral state reconstructions they
are based on, are simply weighted averages of the tip data; their morphology will always fall
within the range of the tip data. Thus, it is no wonder that it in practice smooths out the curve
from the original analysis. Does this really provide a better approach? I would like to see a short
discussion of this added to the Discussion.
Minor comments
Line 90 – insignificant meaning not significant? Or insignificant as in small/minute – in which
case it is redundant with small in the same sentence? Not significant should be used if it is being
described with a significance value to avoid this ambiguity.
Figure caption mentions an asterisk that is not visible in the figure
White text on right side of figure is not very readable.

The manuscript “Still Slow, but even Steadier: An Update on the Evolution of Turtle Cranial
Disparity Interpolating Shapes along Branches” by Foth, Ascarrunz and Joyce upgraded they
recent study (Foth and Joyce 2016) about the cranial disparity of turtles through time using
geometric morphometrics. In this upgrade, the authors used they original data (with some small
modifications) from Foth and Joyce (2016) and analysed them applying new methodology
developed by Wilberg (2017) and Friedman (2009). The new methodology developed by Wilberg
(2017) and Friedman (2009) interpolates traits between ancestors and terminal taxa along the
branches. The new analysis provided in this manuscript resulted in similar conclusions than the
previous one (Foth and Joyce 2016) and provides support to their previous hypothesis that the
Miocene dip Foth and Joyce (2016) found is indeed caused by sampling artifacts.
The disparity analysis in turtles using geometric morphometrics is new in our field (Foth and
Joyce, 2016; Foth et al. 2017) and the core of the studies has been developed by two of the authors
present in this ms (Foth and Joyce). This ms adds one more step to this kind of studies. In my
opinion it is publishable with minor revision after the authors make the suggested changes
mentioned in the attached PDF and repeated below.
Calibrated phylogeny: Page 4, lines 64-66 “The recalibration was undertaken by enforcing node
estimates from median ages of molecular clock calibration for the origin of recent turtle clades
[15–20]”. None of those phylogenies have broad taxon samples, they are at “family” level. In my
opinion taking ages from different calibrated trees (using restricted taxon sampling and maybe
different methodologies to calculate the ages) is not the most accurate methodology to calibrate
their tree. I recommend, instead, gathering the ages of the nodes from one source. For example
note that the paper by Pereira et al. (2017) has the biggest taxon sampling of extant turtles,
recovers Crawford et al.'s topology with good supports and provides a molecular clock. In one
paper you can find all the ages. If you compare the ages of the divergence between Cryptodira
and Pleurodira in your supertree (212.3 Mya.) it is much older than the one proposed in Pereira et
al. (2017), which is aroun 197 Mya. The same is true for Cryptodira and other clades. If the
phylogeny is so important for the disparity analysis and this new methodology (Wilberg 2017
and Friedman 2009) uses the branch lengths, I think the authors should pay more attention to
that.
Disparity of turtles driven by biogeographic factors: Page 9, lines 185-187 “the new analyse
[analysis] still favours our original hypothesis that the disparity of turtles appears to be driven by
biogeographic factors, not climate”. In my opinion the authors do not provide any evidence nor
test this hypothesis. Consequently I suggest them to delete this from the conclusions. They also
cited these factors in their previous paper (Foth and Joyce 2016), but they did not test it either. It
is indeed an interesting hypothesis but the authors are not testing it. Instead the authors are
testing the correlation between the climatic curve with the curve of disparity but they are not
testing this hypothesis about the correlation of the disparity of turtles and the biogeographic
factors. The rejection of one hypothesis does not mean that the other hypothesis "is favored". Can
you test your new hypothesis? Otherwise your hypothesis about the correlation of the disparity
with the biogegraphic factors remains untested...

This paper marks an attempt to establish the pattern of morphological diversity (disparity) in
turtles over the past c. 200 million years (a laudable aim) as well as ascertain the major driving
forces behind this pattern (climate, extinction, biogeography). Specifically the authors attempt to
establish whether an apparent depression in disparity in the past 20 million years can be removed
by applying a phylogenetic "correction" to their data (based on work by Friedman 2009 and
Wilberg 2017, both cited by the authors). The manuscript is arguably presented primarily as an
addendum to Foth and Joyce (2016, also already cited by the authors), however as a reviewer I
will treat it as any paper should be, i.e., a stand alone publication. This is important as I feel that
the work commits a number of errors, some of which are novel to the current manuscript, but
others of which are carried over from the original work (and hence could - and hence should - be
corrected or amended here). I provide both major and minor comments that I hope the authors
can use to improve their manuscript below.
My major issues with the paper can be summarised in the following eight points:
1) The authors do not establish a specific hypothesis to test (simple correlations with a single
climate proxy are applied, but are shown to be essentially a poor explanation for their data) and
yet conclude (without evidence) both that extinction is not, and biogeography is, a major driving
factor in their evolution. Hypotheses should be established at the outset and numerical means by
which they can be tested (or falsified) explained and any subsequent results explicitly shown,
whether through tables or graphs. Reference to the previous paper (Foth and Joyce 2016) is
insufficient as they have established a novel time series and hence their results have substantially
altered (additionally this should serve as a stand alone publication, see above).
2) Crucially the authors do not establish that their metric really captures the signal
(morphological diversity) they are looking for. I.e., I believe that they are actually primarily
measuring phylogenetic disparity over time - Figure 1a shows that phylogenetic interpolation
dominates their data, not empirical morphological observations and a likely expectation of
11
phylogenetic interpolations is an artifactually smoother curve: exactly what they find (Figure 1b
and 1c, solid lines exhibit lower volatility than dashed). However, the authors do not properly
explore this interpretation.
3) The authors appear to be misapply the method (Friedman 2009) that they are using. I.e., they
appear to be including both terminal node (observation data) with both interpolated internal
node *and* branch data. This is not the intention of the Friedman method (see his Figure 1). (NB: I
am inferring this from Figure 1a as the authors offer insufficient explanation and no R code is
provided.) In effect this means lineages will be double counted (i.e., a mid-branch value can be
included with one or more end-branch values - terminal or internal nodes). This will lead to both
greater dominance of phylogenetic interpolations over empirical observations (evident in Figure
1a) - eyeballing the data shows this is well over 50% - and further exacerbate the problem above
(i.e., an over-smoothed curve that really primarily represents phylogenetic disparity and not
morphological diversity.
4) The authors additionally misapply the method of Friedman (2009) by not applying both his
"punctuated" *and* "gradual" approaches. They do not justify why they only chose to use the
gradual approach. This is also an additional source of uncertainty they fail to characterise (see
below).
5) The authors critically fail to establish an expected pattern for their data by which it can be
properly interpreted - currently they only briefly note that their data do not appear to fit a model
of "early high" disparity. A crucial reference here is Foote (1996) on "Models of morphological
diversification" where he establishes a series of expectations for how disparity and taxonomic
richness will change over time under a set of simple models. NB: the authors could easily
compare their data to these models to help begin to interpret it correctly using the phylogenetic
hypothesis (lineages through time) as their richness proxy. This would greatly aid placing the
observed pattern on a sounder footing and should be considered as a potential explanation of
their data quite different to both the (already weak) climate proxy (see above) or biogeography
(never established with actual data in the present contribution).
6) Extending this point further the authors could, and should, use their phylogenetic hypothesis
to simulate morphology under simple models (e.g., Brownian Motion) and measure the resulting
disparity patterns under the same protocols to more correctly establish an expected pattern of
morphological diversity which they can compare their actual empirical data to.
7) The authors also appear to misunderstand how sampling biases operate and potential shape
their data. Specifically the paper focuses on a single short window where a depression in
disparity is attributed solely to sampling bias. This is problematic as sampling bias can operate in
both directions - high sampling can just as easily explain high disparity - and there are other
points in their time series where the number of observations are just as low if not lower (Figure
1a). However, it does not appear that a correlation between N observations and disparity exists
(by eyeballing the data - NB: without the raw data I was unable to conduct analyses of my own).
Furthermore, sampling issues should really be tackled using a subsampling approach (if this is
the authors true aim) and not phylogenetic interpolation (which can simply introduce it's own
biases - see comments above). Specifically I would urge the authors to explore techniques like
that outlined in Kotric and Knoll (2015; Paleobiology, 41, 68-).
8) Finally, the authors assume at every step of their protocol that their data is both precise and
accurate, or to put it more simply there is an alarming lack of confidence intervals anywhere in
their results. Specifically, they treat their phylogeny as perfectly known, they treat their tip ages
as perfectly known, they treat all divergence times as perfectly known, they treat their ancestral
reconstructions as perfectly known etc. All of these are more accurately treated as sources of error
that should (and can be) easily modelled in their data and the resulting effects used to establish
the robustness of their pattern. For example, a sample of phylogenetic hypotheses reflecting the
uncertainty in their relationships could be used, tip ages could be randomly sampled from
12
uniform distributions between their first and last appearance datum, divergence estimates could
be sampled from the full distributions (not just the median), the uncertainty in ancestral
reconstruction values could be reported instead of just the point estimate used, Without these
steps it is impossible to know how robust the apparent pattern is and hence any interpretations of
it are potentially seriously undermined.
I list some other more minor suggestions below:
- The authors should use K-Pg not K-T as it maintains parity in geologic time-scale "rank", i.e.,
Period-Period.
- "which quantifies morphological diversity as opposed to taxonomic diversity" This is
misleading as both richness and disparity are biodiversity metrics, but only two of a much larger
suite (e.g., evenness, functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity). I.e., the authors are
characterising them as the only two options. Suggest rewording.
- The authors do not establish why they are using 2D data and not 3D. If they have three separate
views then xyz landmarks could be established without the need to choose a single view that
captures the most variance (i.e., they could just capture *all* variance). On a similar note the
authors should be careful to use cranial disparity throughout the manuscript as they cannot
establish the pattern from postcranial disparity or indeed whole organism disparity with their
data. Alternatively a sentence establishing that they only mean cranial disparity when using
"disparity" later should be inserted at an early stage. This avoids the danger of over-interpreting a
single portion of the skeleton as explaining the entire morphological diversity of the clade.
- An additional sensitivity test the authors should consider is the effects on the disparity time
series by removing specific taxa. In other words, what effect do outliers have on the data? This
can help them empirically get at the issue they raise themselves in the discussion - i.e.,
morphologically diverse but incomplete specimens are already excluded and some taxon ranges
are truncated based on additional analysis of the turtle fossil record. This approach could
simulate empirically what kinds of effects this issue can be expected to have, greatly
strengthening any conclusions made.
- The notion that the authors approach "fully addresses the sampling issue" is obviously incorrect
as it is patently impossible for any of us to ever achieve this! Suggest omitting.
- "We furthermore restricted our analysis by excluding Eunontosaurus africanus (Late Permian)
and Pappochelys rosinae (Middle Triassic) as both taxa fall far outside the time binning scheme
relevant to true turtles (Testudinata)". At what stage in the analysis are these taxa excluded? I.e., I
would strongly suggest they be included initially for two reasons: 1) they are key taxa for time-
scaling the phylogenetic hypothesis, and 2) they are also likely to be key taxa for establishing
accurate ancestral reconstructions. If not already I strongly encourage the authors to only omit
the taxa *after* these two steps have been completed in their protocol.
- "We finally recalibrated our supertree using the R package paleotree 2.7" The authors need to
provide more information here. I assume by "recalibrated" they actually mean they time-scaled
their phylogeny, and further that these branch-lengths (millions of years) are the ones used to
perform the ancestral reconstructions. However, they should be more explicit on what functions
were used as well as provide as supporting information or a Dryad upload their raw data and
code (see below).
- The authors use sum of variances as their disparity metric throughout, but many possible
metrics exist. The authors should minimally explain this choice, and ideally establish that their
pattern is robust to other (potentially just as valid) choices. For example, sum or product of
ranges, product of variances, mean pairwise distance, hypercubic volume, hyperellipsoid volume
etc.
- The authors state that to "estimate the degree of significance of disparity differences between
adjacent time bins, a shuffle test was conducted with 10,000 replicates" I have no idea what a
"shuffle test" is, nor are these results visualised in the sole figure. Some explanation/visualisation
would greatly aid understanding here.
- The authors state that they "tested for a correlation between disparity and climate", but do not
delineate how they solved the great difficulties in comparing time series that were constructed in
such drastically different manners. For example, these need to be first placed within the same
13
scheme (e.g., a single system of instantaneous time-slices/point estimates, a series of within-bin
values, moving averages, parameter values from some complex function fitted to the data etc.)
and other major issues need to be dealt with such as temporal autocorrelation, non-stationarity of
time series, heteroscedacity of data etc. This is not a simple matter and the choices made will
undoubtedly lead to different outcomes - potentially drastically so. There is no easy or clear
answer here, but the authors should minimally fully explain the approach they used here.
- The authors state that "this clade is not affected by the K/T extinction", but this should be
interpreted in the context of some external frame of reference. For example, was there a major
taxonomic richness loss here? Was the clade in question selectively effected by comparison to
other turtle clades? Was there a loss of morphological outlier taxa? If the answers are all no then
why would we expect any effect in disparity anyway?
- Examination of the tree file provided shows that it is not fully resolved (bifurcating) as there are
only 135 internal nodes and 144 terminal nodes (a fully resolved rooted tree would have N - 1
internal nodes, i.e., 143). Assuming that these polytomies represent phylogenetic uncertainty the
authors should address how treating soft polytomies as hard (as seems to be implied without
further methodological details) might bias their results. (See also the major comment regarding
unquantified uncertainties above.)
- That Table S2 indicates no significant bin-to-bin changes (at an alpha of 0.05) in turtle disparity
deserves far more comment than it currently receives. I strongly suspect this is the result of
introducing phylogenetic bias into their data, smoothing out any volatility (see comments above),
but if not then this is a remarkable outcome for a clade over such a long period. Why should
turtles be able to maintain such apparently great morphological stability?
- "Pan-cryptodires see a notable dip in disparity following the K/T extinction event, mostly likely
due to the loss of various often bizarre marine lineages (e.g., protostegids, sandowniids, etc.)"
There should be no "likely" here as the authors have the data to know. Which is it?
- "in particular testudinoids and chelydroids, that expanded into the habitats left vacated by more
basal groups that went extinct" Are they also expanding into the same areas of the ordination
space? Or are they new areas? If the latter are they still ecologically similar? What does this mean
for interpreting the ordination space?
- "Pan-pleurodire disparity suffers a similar loss during the late Paleogene, again probably due to
the loss of marine adapted lineages at that time (e.g., bothremydids, stereogenyines, etc.)" Again,
the authors have the data to make a definitive statement here, there should be no "probably".
- "Interestingly, although pleurodires only represent about a quarter of all extant turtles [32], their
sum of variance, a disparity measure that takes diversity into account, is greater than that of
cryptodires" This is interesting. I would urge the authors to expand this point further. Was this a
surprise? What can we tell from visual inspection of their crania? Are they also ecologically
diverse? Functionally? Phylogenetically? If not what explains this pattern?
- The authors state that "the Miocene dip in the cranial disparity curves of turtles we retrieved in
our original study [6] turns out to be a gap in the fossil record rather than a natural event" It
seems to me that this statement could be made without any statistical analysis, or explained by
the absence of lineages known to be present due to their existence both before and after this time.
I.e., what are the authors really doing here? (See major comments above.)
- "the new analyse" should be "analysis".
- The only supplementary data is a tree with branch-lengths. Where is the morphological data?
What about the R code? The divergence estimates used? The tip ages used?
- The figures could be improved substantially. For example, the authors could add a proper
geologic time-scale to their x-axes in Figure 1 (for example, using the geoscale package in R).
Similarly there is no visible asterisk on the plot to demarcate the Miocene dip as claimed in the
caption. Major extinction events should also be delineated on the time series to highlight their
effects (or their absence).
- An additional figure showing the correlation data would also be helpful. Biogeographic data
should also be shown visually as far as possible if this is truly considered the explanatory factor
(but see major comments above).

The paper is a short update on a previous study of morphological disparity as described from
turtle cranial shape across lineages through time. The authors recognise a shortcoming in their
previous paper and have used a recently proposed method to examine it. Specifically that there
might be a sampling issue in their data influencing the estimated disparity curve. The solution is
to use a method proposed by Wilberg (2017, Zool J Linn Soc) that builds upon a method by
Brusatte et al. (2011 Paleobiology), whereby ancestral state reconstructions are made by squared-
change parsimony, and those are included in the time bins in which the phylogenetic hypothesis
predicts they would be found. The method is using this phylogenetic approach to boast sample
sizes. Wilberg states that the method “acts to smooth the data by ‘filling in’ time periods with
poor sampling.”
I have no issues with the way the authors have implemented the test – although it puzzles me as
to why only a subset of the variables were used and not the whole shape space, since the methods
being used here do not have multivariate restrictions (but this is not relevant here as they are
simply following their previously published study).
My only concern is that branch length interpolations, and the ancestral state reconstructions they
are based on, are simply weighted averages of the tip data; their morphology will always fall
within the range of the tip data. Thus, it is no wonder that it in practice smooths out the curve
from the original analysis. Does this really provide a better approach? I would like to see a short
discussion of this added to the Discussion.
Minor comments
Line 90 – insignificant meaning not significant? Or insignificant as in small/minute – in which
case it is redundant with small in the same sentence? Not significant should be used if it is being
described with a significance value to avoid this ambiguity.
Figure caption mentions an asterisk that is not visible in the figure

The manuscript “Still Slow, but even Steadier: An Update on the Evolution of Turtle Cranial
Disparity Interpolating Shapes along Branches” by Foth, Ascarrunz and Joyce upgraded they
recent study (Foth and Joyce 2016) about the cranial disparity of turtles through time using
geometric morphometrics. In this upgrade, the authors used they original data (with some small
modifications) from Foth and Joyce (2016) and analysed them applying new methodology
developed by Wilberg (2017) and Friedman (2009). The new methodology developed by Wilberg
(2017) and Friedman (2009) interpolates traits between ancestors and terminal taxa along the
branches. The new analysis provided in this manuscript resulted in similar conclusions than the
previous one (Foth and Joyce 2016) and provides support to their previous hypothesis that the
Miocene dip Foth and Joyce (2016) found is indeed caused by sampling artifacts.
The disparity analysis in turtles using geometric morphometrics is new in our field (Foth and
Joyce, 2016; Foth et al. 2017) and the core of the studies has been developed by two of the authors
present in this ms (Foth and Joyce). This ms adds one more step to this kind of studies. In my
opinion it is publishable with minor revision after the authors make the suggested changes
mentioned in the attached PDF and repeated below.
Calibrated phylogeny: Page 4, lines 64-66 “The recalibration was undertaken by enforcing node
estimates from median ages of molecular clock calibration for the origin of recent turtle clades
[15–20]”. None of those phylogenies have broad taxon samples, they are at “family” level. In my
15
opinion taking ages from different calibrated trees (using restricted taxon sampling and maybe
different methodologies to calculate the ages) is not the most accurate methodology to calibrate
their tree. I recommend, instead, gathering the ages of the nodes from one source. For example
note that the paper by Pereira et al. (2017) has the biggest taxon sampling of extant turtles,
recovers Crawford et al.'s topology with good supports and provides a molecular clock. In one
paper you can find all the ages. If you compare the ages of the divergence between Cryptodira
and Pleurodira in your supertree (212.3 Mya.) it is much older than the one proposed in Pereira et
al. (2017), which is aroun 197 Mya. The same is true for Cryptodira and other clades. If the
phylogeny is so important for the disparity analysis and this new methodology (Wilberg 2017
and Friedman 2009) uses the branch lengths, I think the authors should pay more attention to
that.
Disparity of turtles driven by biogeographic factors: Page 9, lines 185-187 “the new analyse
[analysis] still favours our original hypothesis that the disparity of turtles appears to be driven by
biogeographic factors, not climate”. In my opinion the authors do not provide any evidence nor
test this hypothesis. Consequently I suggest them to delete this from the conclusions. They also
cited these factors in their previous paper (Foth and Joyce 2016), but they did not test it either. It
is indeed an interesting hypothesis but the authors are not testing it. Instead the authors are
testing the correlation between the climatic curve with the curve of disparity but they are not
testing this hypothesis about the correlation of the disparity of turtles and the biogeographic
factors. The rejection of one hypothesis does not mean that the other hypothesis "is favored". Can
you test your new hypothesis? Otherwise your hypothesis about the correlation of the disparity
with the biogegraphic factors remains untested...

Dear Prof Blundy,
please find attached the revised version of the manuscript “Still slow, but even steadier: An
update on the evolution of turtle cranial disparity interpolating shapes along branches“
Manuscript ID RSOS-170899). We are grateful for the comments provided by the three
eviewers and tried to implement all of their suggestions. This includes e.g. the additional
analyses suggested by reviewer#1 and the inclusion of the molecular dating from Pereira et al.
2017) (see reviewer#3). As you can see, the additional analyses did not change much of the
outcome, but help to make our results much more robust in terms of uncertainties in fossil
dating and phylogenetic relationships. All changes are marked in red. We further provided
detailed responses to the reviewers, where it was necessary. Finally, we made all of our
scripts and data public available now.
We hope that the new version fulfills the standard for publication in RSOS.
Yours sincerely,
Christian Foth (on behalf of both authors)
Associate Editor Comments to Author:
The authors should incorporate the R1 and R3 recommendations. Specially, the
methodological corrections and suggestions of the first one, and the calibration section of R3
Why do the authors not use Pereira et al. 2017 ?). Moreover, both reviewers criticized the
ollowing statement " the new analyse [analysis] still favours our original hypothesis that the
disparity of turtles appears to be driven by biogeographic factors, not climate"(Page 9, lines
185-187). Could the authors work on it?
<U+F0B7> We have implemented all these suggestions (see below).

This paper marks an attempt to establish the pattern of morphological diversity (disparity) in
urtles over the past c. 200 million years (a laudable aim) as well as ascertain the major
driving forces behind this pattern (climate, extinction, biogeography). Specifically the authors
attempt to establish whether an apparent depression in disparity in the past 20 million years
can be removed by applying a phylogenetic "correction" to their data (based on work by
Friedman 2009 and Wilberg 2017, both cited by the authors). The manuscript is arguably
presented primarily as an addendum to Foth and Joyce (2016, also already cited by the
authors), however as a reviewer I will treat it as any paper should be, i.e., a stand alone
publication. This is important as I feel that the work commits a number of errors, some of
which are novel to the current manuscript, but others of which are carried over from the
original work (and hence could - and hence should – be corrected or amended here). I provide
both major and minor comments that I hope the authors can use to improve their manuscript
below.
My major issues with the paper can be summarised in the following eight points:
1) The authors do not establish a specific hypothesis to test (simple correlations with a single
climate proxy are applied, but are shown to be essentially a poor explanation for their data)
and yet conclude (without evidence) both that extinction is not, and biogeography is, a major
driving factor in their evolution. Hypotheses should be established at the outset and numerical
means by which they can be tested (or falsified) explained and any subsequent results
explicitly shown, whether through tables or graphs. Reference to the previous paper (Foth and
Joyce 2016) is insufficient as they have established a novel time series and hence their results
have substantially altered (additionally this should serve as a stand alone publication, see
above).
<U+F0B7> Although the reviewer treats the manuscript as independent, he/she cannot
negate the fact that this study represent an update of Foth & Joyce (2016), as
mentioned in the Introduction. Because of the overlap in sampling and parts of
the methodology we avoided unnecessary repetitions in Material and Methods,
but also in the Discussion. However, as all reviewers pointed out that specific
details should be mentioned and discussed, we are happy to include them into the
text (see below).
<U+F0B7> Concerning the hypotheses, we simply referred to our previous study, as this
study investigates the same question, just with an extended set of methods.
However, we specifically noted that we want to test, if the Miocene gap is a
sampling artifact or not. It is not stated in form of a hypothesis, but the aim of
the manuscript is clearly formulated.
<U+F0B7> Finally, following the reviewer’s suggestion of numerical methods to evaluate the
biogeographic hypothesis, we tested for the correlation between the number of
turtle-populated isolated continental landmasses and the sum of variances.
2) Crucially the authors do not establish that their metric really captures the signal
morphological diversity) they are looking for. I.e., I believe that they are actually primarily
measuring phylogenetic disparity over time - Figure 1a shows that phylogenetic interpolation
dominates their data, not empirical morphological observations and a likely expectation of
phylogenetic interpolations is an artifactually smoother curve: exactly what they find (Figure
1b and 1c, solid lines exhibit lower volatility than dashed). However, the authors do not
properly explore this interpretation.
<U+F0B7> We agree with the reviewer that phylogenetic interpolation should be expected to
have a smoothing effect. We now refer to this in the results and discussion. How
the disparity curve looks when only terminal taxa are used, can be seen in the
Suppl. Material of Foth & Joyce (2016). As the fossil record is rather poor,
especially over a time period of 200 Myr, a phylogenetic interpolation is
necessary to get any meaningful signal.
3) The authors appear to be misapply the method (Friedman 2009) that they are using. I.e.,
hey appear to be including both terminal node (observation data) with both interpolated
nternal node *and* branch data. This is not the intention of the Friedman method (see his
Figure 1). (NB: I am inferring this from Figure 1a as the authors offer insufficient explanation
and no R code is provided.) In effect this means lineages will be double counted (i.e., a mid
branch value can be included with one or more end-branch values - terminal or internal
nodes). This will lead to both greater dominance of phylogenetic interpolations over empirical
observations (evident in Figure 1a) - eyeballing the data shows this is well over 50% - and
urther exacerbate the problem above (i.e., an over-smoothed curve that really primarily
epresents phylogenetic disparity and not morphological diversity.
<U+F0B7> To be clear, we are using specifically Friedman’s method for interpolating traits
along branch lengths, not the whole methodology of Friedman (2009).
<U+F0B7> Addressing the reviewer’s concern of double-counting, we now decided to restrict
our sampling to branch-interpolated shape variables, only. Consequently, we no
longer include direct observations of shape in the computation of the sum of
variances. However, those observations will still have strong weight when their
corresponding terminal branches are sampled. For instance, for the Recent bin in
Foth and Joyce (2016) found a global sum of variances of 0.0455 including in
their sample the values at the terminal nodes, but not the branches. In the
present study, the corresponding median value of the sum of variances is 0.0431.
<U+F0B7> As mentioned above, the smoothing effect of phylogenetic interpolation is now
mentioned in the manuscript.
<U+F0B7> Finally, we find it important to mentioned that we had estimated disparity
through time only for terminal taxa in the Foth & Joyce (2016) and already
compared with the curve, when hypothetical ancestors are included. The main
courses of the curves were quite similar with both showing the Miocene gap.
4) The authors additionally misapply the method of Friedman (2009) by not applying both his
"punctuated" *and* "gradual" approaches. They do not justify why they only chose to use the
gradual approach. This is also an additional source of uncertainty they fail to characterise (see
below).
<U+F0B7> As stated above, we are specifically using Friedman’s method for interpolating
traits along branch lengths, not the whole methodology of Friedman (2009). We
only focused on the gradual model, because the punctual model appears rather
unrealistic under the current circumstances, as it assumes morphological changes
only at speciation events. Having a complete fossil record covering all branching
events in the history of clade, this might be the preferred approach. However, as
our phylogeny is characterized by many long ghost lineages (e.g., for
Meiolaniformes), using only one constant value over the entire branch length
implies multiple evolutionary phases of stasis over long periods of time. Because
ghost lineages are a result of sampling and do not corresponds the ‘true’
evolution of a clade, we prefer to use the gradual model, although the linear
interpolation of traits along branches might be a rather simple approach. A short
statement was added to the text (see Material and Methods).
5) The authors critically fail to establish an expected pattern for their data by which it can be
properly interpreted – currently they only briefly note that their data do not appear to fit a
model of "early high" disparity. A crucial reference here is Foote (1996) on "Models of
morphological diversification" where he establishes a series of expectations for how disparity
and taxonomic richness will change over time under a set of simple models. NB: the authors
could easily compare their data to these models to help begin to interpret it correctly using the
phylogenetic hypothesis (lineages through time) as their richness proxy. This would greatly
aid placing the observed pattern on a sounder footing and should be considered as a potential
explanation of their data quite different to both the (already weak) climate proxy (see above)
or biogeography (never established with actual data in the present contribution).
<U+F0B7> The delayed disparity peak was already discussed in Foth & Joyce (2016),
indicating that morphological diversification is concordant with taxonomic
diversification with no constraint on morphological evolution nor trends in
morphological step size (see Wesley-Hunt 2005). However, we are grateful for the
literature suggestion and add this to our discussion. Based on Foote’s (1996)
simulations we can now hypothesize that until the Late Cretaceous morphological
step size was constant with no temporal changes. During the Cenozoic the
morphological steps are significantly reduced compared to the Mesozoic leading
to a more or less constant disparity. As this pattern is evident for both the main
clade and the subclade we can suggest that both lineages underwent a similar
evolution. In contrast to this pattern, taxonomic diversity increase in a
exponential pattern.
<U+F0B7> The biogeographic correlation is now assessed with data.
6) Extending this point further the authors could, and should, use their phylogenetic
hypothesis to simulate morphology under simple models (e.g., Brownian Motion) and
measure the resulting disparity patterns under the same protocols to more correctly establish
an expected pattern of morphological diversity which they can compare their actual empirical
data to.
<U+F0B7> An in-depth examination of the behaviour of the methods with simulated data is
beyond the scope of the current study. However, we repeated our main analysis
excluding fossils, showing that the overall shape of the curve is dominated by the
phylogeny and the observations of extant species. This should highlight to the
reader the critical importance of the choice of method.
7) The authors also appear to misunderstand how sampling biases operate and potential shape
heir data. Specifically the paper focuses on a single short window where a depression in
disparity is attributed solely to sampling bias. This is problematic as sampling bias can
operate in both directions - high sampling can just as easily explain high disparity – and there
are other points in their time series where the number of observations are just as low if not
ower (Figure 1a). However, it does not appear that a correlation between N observations and
disparity exists (by eyeballing the data – NB: without the raw data I was unable to conduct
analyses of my own). Furthermore, sampling issues should really be tackled using a
subsampling approach (if this is the authors true aim) and not phylogenetic interpolation
which can simply introduce it's own biases - see comments above). Specifically I would urge
he authors to explore techniques like that outlined in Kotric and Knoll (2015; Paleobiology,
41, 68-).
<U+F0B7> This criticism is again based on the reviewer’s decision to consider this
manuscript to be an completely independent study and not as an update of Foth
& Joyce (2016). In the original paper, we tested the correlation between sample
size and disparity, finding no correlation. In current manuscript we also tested
the correlation between median curve sum of variance and the number of
branches per bin. We have extended the discussion on this problem.
8) Finally, the authors assume at every step of their protocol that their data is both precise and
accurate, or to put it more simply there is an alarming lack of confidence intervals anywhere
n their results. Specifically, they treat their phylogeny as perfectly known, they treat their tip
ages as perfectly known, they treat all divergence times as perfectly known, they treat their
ancestral reconstructions as perfectly known etc. All of these are more accurately treated as
sources of error that should (and can be) easily modelled in their data and the resulting effects
used to establish the robustness of their pattern. For example, a sample of phylogenetic
hypotheses reflecting the uncertainty in their relationships could be used, tip ages could be
andomly sampled from uniform distributions between their first and last appearance datum,
divergence estimates could be sampled from the full distributions (not just the median), the
uncertainty in ancestral reconstruction values could be reported instead of just the point
estimate used, Without these steps it is impossible to know how robust the apparent pattern is
and hence any interpretations of it are potentially seriously undermined.
<U+F0B7> We have now implemented all these suggestions.
I list some other more minor suggestions below:
The authors should use K-Pg not K-T as it maintains parity in geologic time-scale "rank",
.e., Period-Period.
<U+F0B7> The decision to split the Tertiary into the Paleogene and Neogene is not
universally accepted and the International Stratigraphic Commission is currently
discussing plans to reintroduce the Tertiary. We are therefore at liberty to use
K/T.
"which quantifies morphological diversity as opposed to taxonomic diversity" This is
misleading as both richness and disparity are biodiversity metrics, but only two of a much
arger suite (e.g., evenness, functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity). I.e., the authors are
characterising them as the only two options. Suggest rewording.
<U+F0B7> This was changed.
The authors do not establish why they are using 2D data and not 3D. If they have three
separate views then xyz landmarks could be established without the need to choose a single
view that captures the most variance (i.e., they could just capture *all* variance). On a similar
note the authors should be careful to use cranial disparity throughout the manuscript as they
cannot establish the pattern from postcranial disparity or indeed whole organism disparity
with their data. Alternatively a sentence establishing that they only mean cranial disparity
when using "disparity" later should be inserted at an early stage. This avoids the danger of
over-interpreting a single portion of the skeleton as explaining the entire morphological
diversity of the clade.
<U+F0B7> Our study focuses on 2D, because the amount of 3D scans available for extinct
turtles is limited.
<U+F0B7> If the reviewer meant to suggest that we combine the data of our 2D views to
form 3D models, the problem of this approach is that the number of shared
landmarks between the different views is low. Therefore, a 3D model would be
obtained at the expense of the loss of a great amount of shape data.
<U+F0B7> The term ‘disparity’ was changed to ‘cranial disparity’.
An additional sensitivity test the authors should consider is the effects on the disparity time
series by removing specific taxa. In other words, what effect do outliers have on the data?
This can help them empirically get at the issue they raise themselves in the discussion - i.e.,
morphologically diverse but incomplete specimens are already excluded and some taxon
anges are truncated based on additional analysis of the turtle fossil record. This approach
could simulate empirically what kinds of effects this issue can be expected to have, greatly
strengthening any conclusions made.
<U+F0B7> In a further study (Foth et al. 2017), we showed that the cranial morphospace of
turtles is not really characterized by outliers. Therefore, we think that the
concerns of the reviewer are unjustified. Furthermore, we removed specific taxa
by analysing the disparity course of pan-pleurodires and pan-cryptodires.
<U+F0B7> For the revised version, we also estimated the disparity from 1,000 trees, where
all fossil taxa were excluded. Although the disparity is slightly lower, the main
shape of the curve retains.
The notion that the authors approach "fully addresses the sampling issue" is obviously
ncorrect as it is patently impossible for any of us to ever achieve this! Suggest omitting.
<U+F0B7> This was softened.
"We furthermore restricted our analysis by excluding Eunontosaurus africanus (Late
Permian) and Pappochelys rosinae (Middle Triassic) as both taxa fall far outside the time
binning scheme relevant to true turtles (Testudinata)". At what stage in the analysis are these
axa excluded? I.e., I would strongly suggest they be included initially for two reasons: 1)
hey are key taxa for time-scaling the phylogenetic hypothesis, and 2) they are also likely to
be key taxa for establishing accurate ancestral reconstructions. If not already I strongly
encourage the authors to only omit the taxa *after* these two steps have been completed in
heir protocol.
<U+F0B7> We included these two taxa in our original paper for interest. However, the
original reconstruction of Pappochelys was slightly erroneous, see Schoch and
Sues (2017). The latter paper was published when this manuscript was already in
review, and, in any case, any reconstruction of the skull of Pappochelys should be
regarded as subject to much uncertainty, as it based on different specimens (also
with different size ranges) in which the skull material is usually associated not
articulated, and also affected by compression. (pers. comm. from Rainer Schoch
to CF, 2017). Eunotosaurus was deleted based on its age as sampling is extremely
poor across the Permian to Middle Triassic. Thus, we rather focus on
Testudinata.
"We finally recalibrated our supertree using the R package paleotree 2.7" The authors need
o provide more information here. I assume by "recalibrated" they actually mean they time-
scaled their phylogeny, and further that these branch-lengths (millions of years) are the ones
used to perform the ancestral reconstructions. However, they should be more explicit on what
unctions were used as well as provide as supporting information or a Dryad upload their raw
data and code (see below).
<U+F0B7> We added the function and the parameters used to the text.
The authors use sum of variances as their disparity metric throughout, but many possible
metrics exist. The authors should minimally explain this choice, and ideally establish that
heir pattern is robust to other (potentially just as valid) choices. For example, sum or product
of ranges, product of variances, mean pairwise distance, hypercubic volume, hyperellipsoid
volume etc.
<U+F0B7> Based on Butler et al. (2012) we choose Sum of Variance as disparity metric,
because it is more robust regarding sample size differences and outliers. This was
added to the text.
The authors state that to "estimate the degree of significance of disparity differences
between adjacent time bins, a shuffle test was conducted with 10,000 replicates" I have no
dea what a "shuffle test" is, nor are these results visualised in the sole figure. Some
explanation/ visualisation would greatly aid understanding here.
<U+F0B7> The function of the test is briefly describe above. It swaps samples (PC scores of
terminals, branches, or internal nodes) randomly between two subsequent bins
by keeping the sample size constant.
The authors state that they "tested for a correlation between disparity and climate", but do
not delineate how they solved the great difficulties in comparing time series that were
constructed in such drastically different manners. For example, these need to be first placed
within the same scheme (e.g., a single system of instantaneous time-slices/point estimates, a
series of within-bin values, moving averages, parameter values from some complex function
itted to the data etc.) and other major issues need to be dealt with such as temporal
autocorrelation, non-stationarity of time series, heteroscedacity of data etc. This is not a
simple matter and the choices made will undoubtedly lead to different outcomes – potentially
drastically so. There is no easy or clear answer here, but the authors should minimally fully
explain the approach they used here.
<U+F0B7> Based on Foth & Joyce 2016 we added a short description how the comparisons
were applied in the supplementary material (see Text S1).
The authors state that "this clade is not affected by the K/T extinction", but this should be
nterpreted in the context of some external frame of reference. For example, was there a major
axonomic richness loss here? Was the clade in question selectively effected by comparison to
other turtle clades? Was there a loss of morphological outlier taxa? If the answers are all no
hen why would we expect any effect in disparity anyway?
<U+F0B7> We added a few sentences for clarification. The change of disparity course we see
in the Cenozoic are probably related to a habitat loss due to cooling after the
Eocene, the extinction of paracryptodires during the Eocene and the
homogenization of turtles faunas due to a global conquest of pan-cryptodires (see
Foth and Joyce 2016.).
Examination of the tree file provided shows that it is not fully resolved (bifurcating) as there
are only 135 internal nodes and 144 terminal nodes (a fully resolved rooted tree would have N
1 internal nodes, i.e., 143). Assuming that these polytomies represent phylogenetic
uncertainty the authors should address how treating soft polytomies as hard (as seems to be
mplied without further methodological details) might bias their results. (See also the major
comment regarding unquantified uncertainties above.)
<U+F0B7> We corrected this in the new version of the manuscript.
That Table S2 indicates no significant bin-to-bin changes (at an alpha of 0.05) in turtle
disparity deserves far more comment than it currently receives. I strongly suspect this is the
esult of introducing phylogenetic bias into their data, smoothing out any volatility (see
comments above), but if not then this is a remarkable outcome for a clade over such a long
period. Why should turtles be able to maintain such apparently great morphological stability?
<U+F0B7> The absence of significance was already presented in Foth & Joyce (2016), where
terminal and ancestral shapes were included, but also when only terminal taxa
were analysed (leading to a reduced number of time bins due to smaller sample
sizes per bin). Thus, it is not an artifact of the method, but seems to be an actual
signal. We interpreted these small non-siginificant changes as an indicator for the
slow and steady evolution of cranial disparity in turtles. A comment was added to
the text.
"Pan-cryptodires see a notable dip in disparity following the K/T extinction event, mostly
ikely due to the loss of various often bizarre marine lineages (e.g., protostegids, sandowniids,
etc.)" There should be no "likely" here as the authors have the data to know. Which is it?
<U+F0B7> This was changed.
"in particular testudinoids and chelydroids, that expanded into the habitats left vacated by
more basal groups that went extinct" Are they also expanding into the same areas of the
ordination space? Or are they new areas? If the latter are they still ecologically similar? What
does this mean for interpreting the ordination space?
<U+F0B7> In Foth et al. (2016) we could demonstrate that the different turtles clades have
rather stable positions within the morphospace. Thus, even when turtles from
different clades evolve similar ecological preferences they stay in their clade-
specific morphospace so that do not observe much convergent evolution in shape.
These changes in ecology result rather in an increase or decrease of the particular
morphospace of the clade.
"Pan-pleurodire disparity suffers a similar loss during the late Paleogene, again probably due
o the loss of marine adapted lineages at that time (e.g., bothremydids, stereogenyines, etc.)"
Again, the authors have the data to make a definitive statement here, there should be no
"probably".
<U+F0B7> This was changed.
"Interestingly, although pleurodires only represent about a quarter of all extant turtles [32],
heir sum of variance, a disparity measure that takes diversity into account, is greater than that
of cryptodires" This is interesting. I would urge the authors to expand this point further. Was
his a surprise? What can we tell from visual inspection of their crania? Are they also
ecologically diverse? Functionally? Phylogenetically? If not what explains this pattern?
<U+F0B7> The metric we use, the sum of variances, is dependent on sample size and
therefore often retrieves results that at first seem counterintuitive. We see little
point in expanding this point, as we have no immediate explanation for this
observation.
The authors state that "the Miocene dip in the cranial disparity curves of turtles we retrieved
n our original study [6] turns out to be a gap in the fossil record rather than a natural event" It
seems to me that this statement could be made without any statistical analysis, or explained by
he absence of lineages known to be present due to their existence both before and after this
ime. I.e., what are the authors really doing here? (See major comments above.)
<U+F0B7> We performed a simple test in Foth & Joyce (2016) by adding actual species
known from the Recent that ghost lineages jumped the Miocene to the Miocene
sample, leading to a decrease of the gap. However, with help of the branch length
interpolation we can demonstrate that this gap is an artifact on a much robust
level, because the long ghost lineages indicate that these particular clades were
present in the Miocene. However, in our view estimating morphological traits
along branches is more sufficient than adding some random taxa as we did in the
previous study.
"the new analyse" should be "analysis".
<U+F0B7> This was changed.
The only supplementary data is a tree with branch-lengths. Where is the morphological data
What about the R code? The divergence estimates used? The tip ages used?
<U+F0B7> There is a pdf included providing all results (the reviewer has already cited it).
Beside, sampling and geometric morphometric data are available in Foth &
Joyce 2016 as stated in the text. As these data sets were not changed, we decided
refer to the other paper, instead of uploading them again. The information
regarding the time calibration were extended. We now provide the R scripts and
the new data used in this study.
The figures could be improved substantially. For example, the authors could add a proper
geologic time-scale to their x-axes in Figure 1 (for example, using the geoscale package in R).
Similarly there is no visible asterisk on the plot to demarcate the Miocene dip as claimed in
he caption. Major extinction events should also be delineated on the time series to highlight
heir effects (or their absence).
<U+F0B7> The asterisk was added to the figure. Concerning the timescale, we prefer the
current version, which marks the major periods and time in Myr (20 Myr
interval). Subdividing the scale into smaller units (i.e., ages) as the reviewer
suggests would make the figure more confusing, while not necessarily providing
more information.
An additional figure showing the correlation data would also be helpful. Biogeographic data
should also be shown visually as far as possible if this is truly considered the explanatory
actor (but see major comments above).
<U+F0B7> The biogeographical model is shown in Joyce et al. (2016). As this is an update of
a previous study, we do not see the point of going much into details.

The paper is a short update on a previous study of morphological disparity as described from
urtle cranial shape across lineages through time. The authors recognise a shortcoming in their
previous paper and have used a recently proposed method to examine it. Specifically that
here might be a sampling issue in their data influencing the estimated disparity curve. The
solution is to use a method proposed by Wilberg (2017, Zool J Linn Soc) that builds upon a
method by Brusatte et al. (2011 Paleobiology), whereby ancestral state reconstructions are
made by squared change parsimony, and those are included in the time bins in which the
phylogenetic hypothesis predicts they would be found. The method is using this phylogenetic
approach to boast sample sizes. Wilberg states that the method “acts to smooth the data by
filling in’ time periods with poor sampling.”
have no issues with the way the authors have implemented the test – although it puzzles me
as to why only a subset of the variables were used and not the whole shape space, since the
methods being used here do not have multivariate restrictions (but this is not relevant here as
hey are simply following their previously published study).
<U+F0B7> The number of variables was estimated with help of the Broken-Stick-Method,
which obtained the most consistent results when compared to other stopping
rules (see Jackson 1993). This was added to the text.
My only concern is that branch length interpolations, and the ancestral state reconstructions
hey are based on, are simply weighted averages of the tip data; their morphology will always
all within the range of the tip data. Thus, it is no wonder that it in practice smooths out the
curve from the original analysis. Does this really provide a better approach? I would like to
see a short discussion of this added to the Discussion.
<U+F0B7> This was added to the discussion (see also response to Reviewer 1).

Line 90 – insignificant meaning not significant? Or insignificant as in small/minute – in
which case it is redundant with small in the same sentence? Not significant should be used if
t is being described with a significance value to avoid this ambiguity.

The manuscript “Still Slow, but even Steadier: An Update on the Evolution of Turtle Cranial
Disparity Interpolating Shapes along Branches” by Foth, Ascarrunz and Joyce upgraded they
ecent study (Foth and Joyce 2016) about the cranial disparity of turtles through time using
geometric morphometrics. In this upgrade, the authors used they original data (with some
small modifications) from Foth and Joyce (2016) and analysed them applying new
methodology developed by Wilberg (2017) and Friedman (2009). The new methodology
developed by Wilberg (2017) and Friedman (2009) interpolates traits between ancestors and
erminal taxa along the branches. The new analysis provided in this manuscript resulted in
similar conclusions than the previous one (Foth and Joyce 2016) and provides support to their
previous hypothesis that the Miocene dip Foth and Joyce (2016) found is indeed caused by
sampling artifacts. The disparity analysis in turtles using geometric morphometrics is new in
our field (Foth and Joyce, 2016; Foth et al. 2017) and the core of the studies has been
developed by two of the authors present in this ms (Foth and Joyce). This ms adds one more
step to this kind of studies. In my opinion it is publishable with minor revision after the
authors make the suggested changes mentioned in the attached PDF and repeated below.
Calibrated phylogeny: Page 4, lines 64-66 “The recalibration was undertaken by enforcing
node estimates from median ages of molecular clock calibration for the origin of recent turtle
clades [15–20]”. None of those phylogenies have broad taxon samples, they are at “family”
evel. In my opinion taking ages from different calibrated trees (using restricted taxon
sampling and maybe different methodologies to calculate the ages) is not the most accurate
methodology to calibrate their tree. I recommend, instead, gathering the ages of the nodes
rom one source. For example note that the paper by Pereira et al. (2017) has the biggest taxon
sampling of extant turtles, recovers Crawford et al.'s topology with good supports and
provides a molecular clock. In one paper you can find all the ages. If you compare the ages of
he divergence between Cryptodira and Pleurodira in your supertree (212.3 Mya.) it is much
older than the one proposed in Pereira et al. (2017), which is aroun 197 Mya. The same is true
or Cryptodira and other clades. If the phylogeny is so important for the disparity analysis and
his new methodology (Wilberg 2017 and Friedman 2009) uses the branch lengths, I think the
authors should pay more attention to that.
<U+F0B7> This is a good point. We now use new ages estimates provided by Pereira et al.
(2017).
Disparity of turtles driven by biogeographic factors: Page 9, lines 185-187 “the new analyse
analysis] still favours our original hypothesis that the disparity of turtles appears to be driven
by biogeographic factors, not climate”. In my opinion the authors do not provide any evidence
nor test this hypothesis. Consequently I suggest them to delete this from the conclusions.
They also cited these factors in their previous paper (Foth and Joyce 2016), but they did not
est it either. It is indeed an interesting hypothesis but the authors are not testing it. Instead the
authors are testing the correlation between the climatic curve with the curve of disparity but
hey are not testing this hypothesis about the correlation of the disparity of turtles and the
biogeographic factors. The rejection of one hypothesis does not mean that the other
hypothesis "is favored". Can you test your new hypothesis? Otherwise your hypothesis about
he correlation of the disparity with the biogegraphic factors remains untested…
<U+F0B7> We now test the biogeographic correlation (see replies to reviewer #1).
