This paper derives the Hassell model of population dynamics from an underlying resource
competition model, and thereby links the exponent of the Hassell equation to the inequality of
individuals in competition (i.e., contest versus scramble). The basic model is a 'cartoon model'
with restricted realism, but this is not a disadvantage; on the one hand, no one expects a complex
realistic situation to be described by as a simple model as the Hassell equation, and on the other
hand, the simplicity of the model makes it easy to discern the mechanism controlling competitive
inequality, which then will operate also in much more complex situations. In the second half of
the paper, the author also considers two extensions to the basic 'cartoon' model. Another nice
feature is that the model links the Hassell and Ricker equations in a mechanistic way.
I do have, however, two conceptual difficulties with the model.
(1) Deterministic models of population dynamics, such as the Hassell model, apply in the limit of
infinitely large populations. In contrast, the binomial distribution in equation (2.1) assumes a
finite population. It is not clear how to resolve this discrepancy. What happens if one takes N,M-
>infinity in (2.1), i.e., a Poisson distribution instead of a binomial?
(2) Assuming a variable amount of resources is a key step in recovering the Hassell model [and
not a "slight change" as said in line 95]. It is not clear what this variation in the total resource
means; one population has only one total resource abundance at a time, and the author clearly
does not mean temporal variation. The averaging in equation 2.7 is consistent with the scenario
where the population is divided into groups of exactly N individuals each, and each group is
given a random amount of resources. Such a subdivision could also solve the first problem
described above. There is, however, no mention of any population subdivision in the ms. Note
that subdivision has been invoked to explain overcompensation.
Minor comments:
- to improve readability, please start a new paragraph for each topic. For example, the last
paragraph of the Discussion includes three largely unrelated topics, an alternative model, the
interpretation of the exponent of the current model, and its extension to several species.
- exact compensation means that N(t+1) is a constant independent of N(t). What the Introduction
calls exact compensation [such as the Beverton-Holt model] was called undercompensation in the
literature.
- the distribution of resources in reality need not be exponential only because we assume to have
no more information than the mean. Hence I find section 2c not convincing, but on the other hand
I have no objection against assuming a particular [i.e., exponential] distribution.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
In my first review, I raised two concerns, (i) how a deterministic model is applied to a finite
population, and (ii) what is the interpretation of the resource distribution in this model. The
author's answer to both is that N(t+1) is not meant to be population size in generation t+1 but the
expectation of the (random) population size at t+1.
While this answer is technically correct, unfortunately it is not satisfactory. Population models
like the Hassell model are used to predict population dynamics over a number of generations.
For this natural purpose, the expected population size is insufficient; one cannot substitute the
mean of N(t+1) when predicting N(t+2) etc. Importantly, to predict even the expectation of
N(t+2), one needs the full distribution of N(t+1). Hence while formally the result is correct, it
cannot be used as a model describing the dynamics of a finite population with variable resource
abundance.

The author has done a good job addressing my concerns and that of the other reviewer
I believe the manuscript is suitable for publication as is.
My one very minor comment is that the paragraph starting on 296 (which was split out from the
multi-topic paragraph) is a bit short. I'm wondering if there is anything else worth noting here
about the exponents, such as future research directions of interest, etc.

Subject Editor comments:
Thank you for this revision. As you’ll see, the reviewers offer a split view; however, I have made
a decision on the basis of the reviews received to avoid delaying you unnecessarily. While I am
concerned that the more negative reviewer does not consider your explanation to be sufficiently
compelling, I am recommending that you are granted a further round of revision to amend the
paper and provide a more thorough response to their concerns. Do note, however, that it is
unusual for the journal to offer more than one round of revision, and we will not be able to
consider a further round of revision and review if neither I nor the referee is satisfied once you
have resubmitted.

We are in agreement with the author that his model predicts the expected, rather than the actual,
population size in the next generation, and that this expectation cannot be used iteratively to
predict population size in the subsequent generations. In my opinion, this severely limits the
usefulness of the model, and it is a fact that must be pointed out and discussed. The current text
correctly says that N_t+1 is the expectation, but it does not explain the consequence that the
model is not suitable for iterative predictions. Since most readers automatically take a discrete-
time population model to be iterative, a departure from this assumption has to be discussed.
Further, line 77 attributes the difficulty only to demographic stochasticity, but in fact it is also due
to taking expectation over the resource distribution. In line 75, "We assume" should read "We
show".

en supported by a first-principles derivation. This manuscript provides
at derivation, thereby closing the knowledge gap.
e manuscript is well written and structured and conveys a clear and
ncise message, and I support its publication. I have a few minor
iting suggestions that I believe will improve the manuscript's efficacy
d readability:
I'm not entirely following the statement on lines 77 and 78 "When there
e M resource units in total, the competition for each unit is repeated
times." Can you please explain this further in the text for
arification?
Consider pulling the Hassell model written on line 15 out as its own
uation not in text (make it be not in-line)
On line 50, change "population is subject to a mortality linearly
creasing with the density" to "population is subject to mortality that
nearly increases with density"
The explanation of the justification for relaxing the assumption on
ne 95 is a little rough and could be smoothed out a little bit. I know
at you get to it in more detail in a later section, but it seems to
ed more information or smoother writing.
It's already been clearly shown (for example in Geritz and Kisdi 2004,
ich you cite) that the Ricker and Beverton-Holt Models are limiting
ses of the Hassell Model. To that end, I don't think it's needed for
e author to state this in the abstract, nor to devote a subsection (2b)
thin the main body to this.
The paragraph of Section 2c (starts on line 131) needs a reordering of
e sentences in its second half:
lete the sentence starting "In general, the following..."
en, starting at the sentence beginning "Consider a continuous
riable..."
llow with the sentence starting "As suggested by this example, the
stribution that..." [Although the leading clause "As suggested by this
ample" should be removed from the sentence]
en follow with the sentence starting "The distribution that
ximizes..." and then the sentence starting "For example, when we
ow..."
d then include the sentence starting "When only..."
d then finish with the sentence starting "In this interpretation"
On line 148, I would suggest replacing "However, in real
pulations..." with "However, in many real populations..."
On line 188, I would suggest replacing "...can be a real number..."
th "...can be any real number..."
I would suggest using the "e" symbol with the exponent as an exponent,
ther than "exp" and a parenthetical in Equation 3.8
Start a new paragraph with the sentence beginning "Although this
udy..." on linw 281.
Consider adding a more general concluding paragraph to the end of the
scussion, as presently the manuscript ends on discussion of things not
dressed in the present manuscript (competition).

Title: Inequality in resource allocation and population dynamics models
Author: Masahiro Anazawa
m grateful to reviewer 1 for the critical comments and useful suggestions that have helped me to
rove my paper considerably. As indicated in the responses that follow, I have taken all these
ments and suggestions into account in the revised manuscript.
mments by reviewer 1
mment 1-1
) Deterministic models of population dynamics, such as the Hassell model, apply in the limit of
initely large populations. In contrast, the binomial distribution in equation (2.1) assumes a finite
pulation. It is not clear how to resolve this discrepancy. What happens if one takes N,M->infinity in
.1), i.e., a Poisson distribution instead of a binomial?
ponse
gree with you that deterministic models of population dynamics apply in the limit of infinitely large
pulations. For finite populations, the population size at the next generation should deviate from the
odel's prediction due to demographic stochasticity. In this paper, I assume finite populations and that
e Hassell model describes the expected population size at the next population as a function of the
esent population size. In this interpretation, the discrepancy you are concerned about does not
cur. However, in the original manuscript, I had not stated this interpretation clearly. In the revised
anuscript, I have added some sentences to explain this interpretation (lines 75–78). In the limit of N
infinity and \bar{R} --> infinity, the Hassell model (2.8) approaches a deterministic model.
mment 1-2
) Assuming a variable amount of resources is a key step in recovering the Hassell model [and not a
light change" as said in line 95]. It is not clear what this variation in the total resource means; one
opulation has only one total resource abundance at a time, and the author clearly does not mean
mporal variation. The averaging in equation 2.7 is consistent with the scenario where the population
divided into groups of exactly N individuals each, and each group is given a random amount of
sources. Such a subdivision could also solve the first problem described above. There is, however,
o mention of any population subdivision in the ms. Note that subdivision has been invoked to explain
vercompensation.
ponse
the original manuscript, I failed to explain well the meaning of the distribution of total resource R.
his distribution means a probability, rather than statistical, distribution. At each generation, R takes
ne value, but I assume that we don't know this value and only know its probability distribution
ensity. In other words, at each generation, the value of R is randomly determined according to the
obability density. What I calculate in equations (2.7) and (2.8) is the expected population size at the
ext generation that we can infer based on the knowledge we have (the probability density). In the
vised manuscript, I have added some sentences to explain the distribution of R in section 2(a) (lines
01–107).
Several interpretations of this probability distribution is possible. I had described one interpretation
1
section 2(c) from the viewpoint of the maximum information entropy principle in the original
anuscript. Another possible interpretation is that, as you mentioned, R varies randomly over time
llowing the exponential distribution, which was not mentioned before in the manuscript. I think this
terpretation may be more acceptable to many readers, so I have added a paragraph that explains
is interpretation at end of section 2(c). A subdivision of a population is also a possible interpretation,
ut I don't take this interpretation as I feel this is a little ecologically unnatural.
or comments:
mment 1-3
to improve readability, please start a new paragraph for each topic. For example, the last paragraph
the Discussion includes three largely unrelated topics, an alternative model, the interpretation of
e exponent of the current model, and its extension to several species.
ponse
have divided the second paragraph in the Introduction section of the original manuscript into two
aragraphs (line 33). I have also divided the third and the fourth paragraphs in the Discussion section
to two (line 284) and three paragraphs (lines 296 and 300), respectively.
mment 1-4
exact compensation means that N(t+1) is a constant independent of N(t). What the Introduction calls
xact compensation [such as the Beverton-Holt model] was called undercompensation in the
erature.
ponse
is true that the Hassell model with b=1 (the Beverton-Holt model) shows undercompensating
ensity dependence at small population sizes, but at large populations, N(t+1) is almost constant
dependent of N(t). Hence, it has exact compensating density dependence only at large population
zes. I have corrected a sentence explaining the curve for b=1 to match this fact (line 18--20).
mment 1-5
the distribution of resources in reality need not be exponential only because we assume to have no
ore information than the mean. Hence I find section 2c not convincing, but on the other hand I have
o objection against assuming a particular [i.e., exponential] distribution.
ponse
agree with you that the distribution of resources in reality need not be exponential only because we
ssume to have no more information than the mean. However, the distribution I'm talking about here
a probability distribution rather than a statistical distribution. When we don't know anything about
e statistical distribution but the mean value, the maximum information entropy principle shows that
e most natural estimate of the distribution is an exponential one. I think your concern resulted from
y poor explanation of the distribution of R. As I wrote in Response to Comment 1-2, I have added
ome sentences to explain this distribution in section 2(a) (lines 101–107). Further, I have added a
aragraph to explain another interpretation of the distribution in section 2(c).

is true that the Ricker and Beverton-Holt models had already been shown to be limiting cases of a

Title: Inequality in resource allocation and population dynamics models
Author: Masahiro Anazawa
m grateful to the two reviewers for the helpful comments and for taking the time and effort necessary
eview the manuscript.
mments by reviewer 2
e author has done a good job addressing my concerns and that of the other reviewer. I believe the
anuscript is suitable for publication as is.
y one very minor comment is that the paragraph starting on 296 (which was split out from the multi-
pic paragraph) is a bit short. I'm wondering if there is anything else worth noting here about the
ponents, such as future research directions of interest, etc.
ponse
ank you for your positive comment and suggestion. I have added some text about some ideas that
ght help to derive Hassell models with real number exponents in the future (lines 299–301).
mments by reviewer 1
my first review, I raised two concerns, (i) how a deterministic model is applied to a finite population,
d (ii) what is the interpretation of the resource distribution in this model. The author's answer to both
that N(t+1) is not meant to be population size in generation t+1 but the expectation of the (random)
pulation size at t+1.
hile this answer is technically correct, unfortunately it is not satisfactory. Population models like the
ssell model are used to predict population dynamics over a number of generations. For this natural
rpose, the expected population size is insufficient; one cannot substitute the mean of N(t+1) when
edicting N(t+2) etc. Importantly, to predict even the expectation of N(t+2), one needs the full
stribution of N(t+1). Hence while formally the result is correct, it cannot be used as a model
scribing the dynamics of a finite population with variable resource abundance.
ponse
nderstand that for finite populations, discrete-time population models like the Hassell model cannot
used to predict population dynamics over a number of generations, but the Hassell models derived
this paper are not intended at all to be applied repeatedly over multiple generations. Predicting
pulation dynamics over multiple generations is not the sole use of discrete-time population models.
ey are also used as a tool to statistically understand the relationship between the population sizes
one generation and the next for the purpose of discussing the effect of intraspecific competition. For
ample, in the first half of Hassell (1975), he proposed his model as a mathematical expression to
scribe the density effect based on experimental data of finite populations. This paper considers
ssell models from this point of view. Hence, the output of the function, which expresses the
pectation of the population size at the next generation, is not used as an input to the function.
erefore, the concerns you raised do not occur in this paper.

ewer comments to Author (Reviewer 1):
ment 2
e are in agreement with the author that his model predicts the expected, rather than the actual, population
e in the next generation, and that this expectation cannot be used iteratively to predict population size in
e subsequent generations. In my opinion, this severely limits the usefulness of the model, and it is a fact
t must be pointed out and discussed. The current text correctly says that N_t+1 is the expectation, but it
es not explain the consequence that the model is not suitable for iterative predictions. Since most readers
tomatically take a discrete-time population model to be iterative, a departure from this assumption has to
discussed.
onse
ank you for the helpful comments. I also think this point is very important. I have added the following text
explain the limitation of the derived model at the end of section 2(a) (lines 123–125):

neration, so that it cannot be used iteratively to predict population sizes in the subsequent generations."
