Summary
In this experiment the authors sought to study the exploratory behaviour of mice in a 3D
environment. The animals’ home cage was connected to a large 2D open field environment
similar to the one used by Fonio et al. (2012) and they were then free to explore the environment
under infrared lighting conditions. However, they were also able to climb on the walls of this
apparatus which were covered in a 90 deg wire mesh. Previous experiments have suggested that
animals explore their environment in a serious of stages, each expanding the exploratory area of
the last. Thus, the authors predicted that animals would explore the vertical dimension of this
apparatus last.
The manuscript is well written, clear and concise. The topic is very exciting given the lack of our
understanding of behaviour along the vertical dimension. The authors present a great deal of
evidence to suggest that animals do explore the vertical dimension of their environment.
However, there are many issues with the interpretation of their results and the results are not
discussed well in relation to the previous research. One of the main claims is that animals tend to
explore the vertical dimension by either running vertically upwards or on the top horizontally,
parallel to the floor. However, this seems to be the orientation of the mesh that they used. It is
also unclear whether the vertical exploration occurs before, in parallel to or after horizontal
exploration which is disappointing given this is the main focus of the paper. The authors should
consider repeating the same series of analyses used by Fonio et al. (2012) on the horizontal
portion of their data. This would simultaneously allow them to replicate the results of that paper
and also make some much stronger conclusions about how vertical exploration develops in
relation to horizontal exploration in the current one.
Major comments
1. A major limitation is that one of the key results of the paper is that animals explored the
vertical dimension either vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally. However, this happens to
be the direction of the 90deg mesh that is used. To say that mice do not scale vertical surfaces
diagonally, ideally, an unbiased surface should be used. Alternatively, one can either turn the
mesh in a 45deg angle, or use a hexagonal mesh instead. Without such controls, it is difficult to
interpret results related to the direction of travel. (Related to this, if the bottom surface is also a
mesh, it is possible that even the horizontal movements in the floor are limited to two directions)
2. It is unclear how the current results fit into previous findings. For instance, previous research
from two of the current authors (Fonio, Benjamini & Golani, 2012) showed gradual, staged
exploration of a similar 2D environment in mice. It would be nice to see how the current vertical
exploration fits into that. For instance, in Figure 1 entry 84, it appears that the mouse is starting to
explore the vertical dimension before fully completing the ‘border-related shuttle’ or ‘reaching
centre’ stages of exploration described by Fonio et al. (2012). If this is the case the authors’
assertion that the vertical dimension is explored last is incorrect. Unfortunately, very few
analyses in the current manuscript describe the horizontal exploration of the mice and it is thus
impossible to determine if this is the case. Perhaps something like a figure showing the maximum
height of each vertical ascent and the maximum distance from the outer wall of each horizontal
path vs time would be informative?
3. BALB/c mice are known to exhibit neophobia when confronted with novel exploratory
environments, this should be clarified in materials and methods (Page 7, Line 34) and perhaps
addressed in the discussion.
3
4. It is really hard to picture how the maze actually looks, a picture of the maze would be hugely
beneficial to guide the reader.
5. Related to above, the environment could be described in greater detail. For instance, the height
of the wire mesh is given (Page 7, Line 38) but it is unclear if the walls of the environment
extended past this or if the mice could walk along the top of the mesh or wall.
6. The software used to process the tracking data are described in citations, however, a brief
description of the smoothing and interpolation used is also necessary in text as this impacts many
of the behavioural measures used. The method by which angular rotations were estimated (Page
4, Line 23) is also required.
7. The authors put great care into describing the animals’ behaviour in great detail. However,
very little discussion is dedicated to the various parameters used in the current experiment. For
instance, how might the authors expect the results to change if the animals used were deprived of
food or water?
8. What if the animals explored the current environment in visible light rather than darkness (IR)?
Would this change the behaviour of the animal? Related to this, if the animals were exploring in
visible light, would the authors still expect the mice to show the ‘behavioural trap’ phenomena
and would they still expect the animals to navigate so directly between the floor and top of the
wall or to spend so much time at the top of the wall? These points should be discussed in great
detail.
9. What is the experience of the animal (also age)? Has the animal ever experienced a wire mesh
before? How much does the novelty of the new structure make them explore the vertical
dimension less? Would the behaviour be the same if the animals were placed in a new
environment with a similar vertical structure? This needs to be clearly discussed in the
manuscript.
10. The video of the behaviour was very information and the authors should consider having
figures related to those videos in the manuscript, which are easier to parse than the figures
related to LOESS functions.
Minor comments
• Page 1, Line 33: ‘Coercively’ seems an odd word choice here.
• Page 1, Line 36: Sentences change tense awkwardly.
• Page 4, line 32-36: What was the individual variation like between animals?
• Page 7, Line 5: The ‘sprouting’ behaviour which the authors describe sounds a lot like the
vicarious trial and error described by Tolman and others (i.e. see Redish (2016), Nature Reviews,
http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v17/n3/full/nrn.2015.30.html). If this is the case this
should be cited here.
• Page 7, Line 52: Why do the authors estimate the environment boundary using the animal’s
position data? If the position of the tracking camera is known can they not directly measure the
centre of the environment and know a priori the wall boundary? Can the authors confirm that
mice sufficiently covered the environment in each session such that this algorithm has enough
tracking data to be correct?
• Page 7, Line 54: The tracking algorithm assumes that faster running periods must occur on the
horizontal, because this is easier for the mice. However, this assumption does not seem to be
based on evidence (are mice slower when climbing?). We have to assume that red lines in figure 1
denote faster movement as this is not specified, but if this is the case then there are many red
coloured ascents (i.e. entry 84 and 87) which would suggest mice can actually climb very quickly.
• Page 7, Line 32: It is unclear if mice were able to climb along the ‘rim’ of the recording
environment, if this was permitted was this running considered horizontal or vertical?
• Page 8, Line 28: “For a certain variable…”, I’m unsure what this sentence is referring to.
Figure comments
• In many of the figures LOESS functions for only a single mouse are shown. It should be stated
why this mouse was selected (randomly or because it shows the effect the best etc). In addition it
4
would be nice if the line for this animal is coloured differently in the accompanying panel. i.e. in
Figure 4, the line in panel B corresponding to the animal shown in panel A should be coloured
differently, then panel A gives the reader a reference for understanding panel B and it is clear
whether the animal shown in panel A is an extreme case or not.
• Figure 1: The legend states that motion proceeds from yellow to red so I think this means that
red lines denote faster movement, but this could be clearer. In fact a colourbar showing colour
and specific speed values would be welcome here.
• Figure 2: The scaled raw data line should be replaced with markers and no line as the data
points shown are discontinuous samples (max ascent height). The LOESS is correctly represented
by a line because it is continuous.
• Figure 3: This figure shows the mean of a median of a ratio. If there is any way to show this
data in its more original form then I am sure it would be welcome.

The manuscript relates very interesting results on the emergence and structure of exploratory
behaviour in the vertical dimension in mice, thus complementing earlier studies which focused
on the emergence of such behaviours along the horizontal dimensions.
More than corrections, I would like to provide a some comments, that I hope the authors could
use as starting points to include in the discussion or could be used for further analyses.
1) I note that the authors have used BALB/C mice in the study, how generalizable do they think
these results will be to the C57Bl6 mouse strain?
2) The fact that exploration along the top of the circular enclosure seems to develop in the absence
5
of reference to the doorway to the home cage is intriguing, especially as in previous work the
group had demonstrated that trips along the edge of the circular environment (the floor of the
enclosure) were made with reference to the doorway, while excursions to the middle of the
enclosure were not. Could the authors venture any more ideas as to why the top of the circular
enclosure is not treated like the bottom, but, possibly, as an extension of the middle of the
enclosure? What implications this would have for the gathering of allocentric spatial information?
3) In the paradigm employed, the mice are kept for a period up to 48 hours (adaptation and
behaviour recording) under IR lighting conditions. Is this correct? Could the authors explain why
this was done and if they expect completely different results under ‘normal’ lighting conditions?
The more general question is: does changing the sensory channel through which information can
be gathered, change the patterns of exploratory behaviour? Presumably under IR lighting,
BALB/c mice would mainly rely on olfaction/tactile and auditory inputs.

This paper examined the development of exploratory behavior in mice in an arena with vertical
mesh-covered walls. The path of the mice was tracked with an overhead camera, and aspects of
the path quantified. The main finding is that “Morphogenesis of ascents consists of the mice first
reaching the top of the wall, then milling about within circumscribed horizontal sections,
maximizing the complexity of ascents, and then progressing horizontally for increasingly longer
distances on the upper edge of the wire mesh.”
I think that the issue of studying, behaviourally, the exploratory patterns of animals in horizontal
vs. vertical spatial dimensions is important, but my enthusiasm for this particular study is
limited. The movements were tracked with a single overhead camera which means that the
sampling of movements on the wall required substantial inference – for example “high horizontal
speed implies movement on the floor.”. In addition, no causal hypotheses were tested, and only
the one environment was studied so we do not know to what the extent the patterns seen here
would generalize to environments in general. Apart from their own papers, which they cite quite
a lot, there is also a literature on exploratory behavior that was not explored (e.g., Whishaw and
6
Brooks, 1999; Wallace et al., 2002; Kazlauckas et al., 2005; Whishaw et al., 2006; Nemati and
Whishaw, 2007) as well horizontal vs vertical behavioural patterns (Grobéty and Schenk, 1992a,
1992b; Moghaddam et al., 1996; Bardunias and Jander, 2000; Jovalekic et al., 2011).
One more issue to consider is how much of the pattern of unfolding could be due simply to the
mice learning to climb? If they have been cage-housed they may not be skilled at first – so the
procedural versus exploratory components of the behavior should be teased apart.
All in all, I feel this study is a little too limited to allow general useful conclusions about 3D
exploration to be drawn.

Journal of Royal Society Open Science
Dear editor and reviewers, 15 January 2018
Please find attached a new manuscript which takes into consideration the comments made by the reviewers. These
useful comments challenged us to perform a major revision, including what we believe to be an important
contribution to the understanding of the modular organization of exploratory behaviour.
Reviewers #1
Reviewers #1 (Dr. Aman Saleem & Dr. Roddy Grieves) find that the study is well written, clear and concise, and
the topic exciting. They have a problem with the interpretation of the results, and the discussion of the results in
relation to previous research.
Major comments:
1. A major limitation is that one of the key results of the paper is that animals explored the vertical dimension
either vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally. However, this happens to be the direction of the 90deg
mesh that is used... Alternatively, one can either turn the mesh in a 45deg angle, or use a hexagonal mesh
instead. Without such controls, it is difficult to interpret results related to the direction of travel.
This concern is addressed in the new manuscript, in Materials and Methods subsection Animals, Experimental
Setup and Testing Protocol and Analysis by saying: "To examine the effect of wire mesh orientation on the
direction of climbing we performed preliminary observations in which we varied the orientation of the wires from
parallel to the ground to diagonal, we found that in both conditions the mice ascend and descend vertically. In other
words, a diagonal orientation of the wires does not induce diagonally oriented ascents. We therefore used the
vertical-horizontal orientation which is easier to construct and handle."
2. It is unclear how the current results fit into previous findings. For instance, previous research from two of
the current authors (Fonio, Benjamini & Golani, 2012) showed gradual, staged exploration of a similar
2D environment in mice. It would be nice to see how the current vertical exploration fits into that… the
authors’ assertion that the vertical dimension is explored last is incorrect. Unfortunately, very few
analyses in the current manuscript describe the horizontal exploration of the mice and it is thus impossible
to determine if this is the case.

We completely agree with this comment. Originally, we wished to focus entirely on the vertical exploration and
leave the issue of the context in which it emerges in relation to exploration of the other dimensions to a future
study. Given this comment, however, we realized that this issue could not be unattended in the current paper.
Presently, we address this issue (of dimensional modularity) in the abstract, introduction, methods, results and
discussion, and it became a significant part of this study. In a nutshell, we address three claims made in Fonio et al.
(2012), by demonstrating that (i) neither the order of the developmental sequence (borderline first, radial next and
vertical last) nor the exhaustion of each dimension before proceeding to the next one hold in the setup including the
vertical wire mesh, and (ii) the claim that there is always a build-up in extent within each dimension does apply to
the current experimental setup. Most important, we demonstrate that the modular organization of behaviour is
conserved in the current setup. By incorporating the analysis of the context in which vertical movement is
exhibited, we accomplished two additional aims on top of the first one already accomplished in the first version of
the paper. This is summarized in the first paragraph of the discussion: "This study accomplishes several aims: i) by
demonstrating that ascents grow and differentiate in a regular, lawful way in reference to the ground during the
occupancy of a novel environment we validate ascents as a 'sequence of repeated motion'... ii) …dimensional
modularity is a robust phenomenon, exhibiting resistance to fragmentation… iii) …we deciphered the complexity
of behavior at an unprecedented late stage in our analysis."
3. BALB/c mice are known to exhibit neophobia when confronted with novel exploratory environments, this
should be clarified in materials and methods (Page 7, Line 34) and perhaps addressed in the discussion.
This is now clarified in the section Animals, Experimental Setup and Testing Protocol and Analysis of Materials
and Methods.
4. It is really hard to picture how the maze actually looks, a picture of the maze would be hugely beneficial to
guide the reader.
A picture of the experimental arena has been added to Materials and Methods (Figure 7).
5. Related to above, the environment could be described in greater detail. For instance, the height of the wire
mesh is given (Page 7, Line 38) but it is unclear if the walls of the environment extended past this or if the
mice could walk along the top of the mesh or wall.
This issue is now addressed in the legend of the picture of the experimental arena (Figure 7).
6. The software used to process the tracking data are described in citations, however, a brief description of
the smoothing and interpolation used is also necessary in text as this impacts many of the behavioural
measures used. The method by which angular rotations were estimated (Page 4, Line 23) is also required.
A description of the method by which direction changes were estimated is now added to Materials and Methods.
The issue of smoothing and interpolation is now addressed by saying "data preparation was done with SEE,

including smoothing of the tracking coordinates and estimating velocities with LOESS and capturing intervals of
zero velocity with Repeated Running Medians (Drai et al. 2001, Hen et al. 2004, Sakov et al. 2010)". Further
description is beyond the scope of this paper, as it would require a summary of several decades' worth of work. For
example, LOESS proved to be a robust method to smooth tracking coordinates during progression, but it fails to
adequately capture segments of zero velocity ("arrests"). In contrast, the use of repeated running medians (RRM) is
ill advised for smoothing, but is useful to capture staying in place intervals. Therefore, a combination of the two
methods is required to adequately estimate the location and the velocity of the mouse.
7. The authors put great care into describing the animals’ behaviour in great detail. However, very little
discussion is dedicated to the various parameters used in the current experiment. For instance, how might
the authors expect the results to change if the animals used were deprived of food or water?
8. What if the animals explored the current environment in visible light rather than darkness (IR)? Would this
change the behaviour of the animal? Related to this, if the animals were exploring in visible light, would
the authors still expect the mice to show the ‘behavioural trap’ phenomena and would they still expect the
animals to navigate so directly between the floor and top of the wall or to spend so much time at the top of
the wall? These points should be discussed in great detail.
Regarding both comments, we now address these issues in the discussion, saying "A setup including simulation of
'moonlight', provision of familiar shelter with ad libitum access to food and water, as well as adequate resources of
time and space, all provide optimal conditions for a spread out build-up of deliberate exploration. The results
provide a baseline which can now be used to examine any effect, such as rearing conditions, different lighting,
food deprivation, genetic differences, drugs and lesions. However, the examination of different lighting is limited
given the requirement for deliberate exploration, without which the phenomena described in this study could not be
exposed. When the arena is lit the mice typically do not come out of the dark home-cage for days". Furthermore,
with the addition of sections dimensional modularity of exploration, we cannot afford discussing effects of
environmental manipulation on behaviour.
Working at an experimental zoo, we have collected videos of wild mice born in the wild and in captivity that were
tested in our setup. These mice were raised in large enclosures with wire mesh to climb on at will. We also have
videos of C57 and other strains tested in our setup. These videos have not undergone tracking and analysis yet, but
preliminary observations reveal that the phenomena described in the present study apply to all: growth in ascents'
height and width across the whole circumference, horizontal movement along the top of the wire mesh, and
organization of exploratory behaviour in bouts. Wild mice exhibit much higher growth rate than BALB/c, and also
manage at some point to jump from the top of the wire mesh to the top of the wall and explore there, but
nevertheless the basic phenomena described in the present study are clearly observed. Tracking and analyzing these
videos would require long and intensive work and would postpone the publication in at least a year. Therefore,
having currently no digitized data to support our claim for generality across the species, we prefer to postpone this
claim for publication in future studies.

behaviour be the same if the animals were placed in a new environment with a similar vertical structure?
This needs to be clearly discussed in the manuscript.
The age of the mice (11 weeks) and the rearing conditions (standard cages) have been added to Materials and
Methods. Regarding the rest of the questions, see the response to comments 7 and 8.
10. The video of the behaviour was very information and the authors should consider having figures related to
those videos in the manuscript, which are easier to parse than the figures related to LOESS functions.
The previous four figures related to the LOESS functions were reduced to two (Figure 2 and Figure 3), and an
illustration was added of the growth in height, complexity and width, corresponding to the videos.
Minor comments:
1. Page 1, Line 33: ‘Coercively’ seems an odd word choice here.
The word "coercively" was deleted.
2. Page 1, Line 36: Sentences change tense awkwardly.
Corrected.
3. Page 7, Line 5: The ‘sprouting’ behaviour which the authors describe sounds a lot like the vicarious trial
and error described by Tolman and others (i.e. see Redish (2016), Nature Reviews,
http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v17/n3/full/nrn.2015.30.html). If this is the case this should be cited
here.
We now address the VTE issue in the section Sprouting of movement along new dimensions of the discussion.
4. Page 7, Line 52: Why do the authors estimate the environment boundary using the animal’s position data?
If the position of the tracking camera is known can they not directly measure the centre of the environment
and know a priori the wall boundary? Can the authors confirm that mice sufficiently covered the
environment in each session such that this algorithm has enough tracking data to be correct?
We now address the question of the necessity of estimating the environmental boundary using the animal's position
data in Material and Methods, section Transformation from 2D to 3D. In addition, we use the popular Ethovision
tracking system which does not include a program for computing the boundary. The option to design and build our
own tracking system is not practical. Therefore, we added a handy way that can be used by future researchers to
compute the boundary in circular arenas. This is also most significant from the point of view of replicability and

reproducibility of our results. The mice indeed sufficiently covered the environment, as illustrated in
supplementary Figure S3.
5. Page 7, Line 54: The tracking algorithm assumes that faster running periods must occur on the horizontal,
because this is easier for the mice. However, this assumption does not seem to be based on evidence (are
mice slower when climbing?). We have to assume that red lines in figure 1 denote faster movement as this
is not specified, but if this is the case then there are many red coloured ascents (i.e. entry 84 and 87) which
would suggest mice can actually climb very quickly.
We now clarify the misunderstanding in Materials and Methods, section Transformation from 2D to 3D, and in the
legend of Figure 1. We now state that in Figure 1, yellow marks the start of the entry (rather than low speed), and
red marks the end of the entry. We added an illustration (supplementary Figure S3) showing that horizontal speed
on the wire mesh is much lower than on the ground.
6. Page 7, Line 32: It is unclear if mice were able to climb along the ‘rim’ of the recording environment, if
this was permitted was this running considered horizontal or vertical?
We now address this issue in the legend of Figure 7, and in the Results, section Growth in ascents' height, width
and complexity.
7. Page 8, Line 28: “For a certain variable…”, I’m unsure what this sentence is referring to.
This section, including this sentence, was revised to avoid confusion.
Figure comments
1. In many of the figures LOESS functions for only a single mouse are shown. It should be stated why this
mouse was selected (randomly or because it shows the effect the best etc). In addition it would be nice if
the line for this animal is coloured differently in the accompanying panel. i.e. in Figure 4, the line in panel
B corresponding to the animal shown in panel A should be coloured differently, then panel A gives the
reader a reference for understanding panel B and it is clear whether the animal shown in panel A is an
extreme case or not.
This has now been amended. The new graphs (Figure 2 and 3) now color the selected mouse differently in panel B,
and the rationale for selection is stated in the legend.

were added to the graph in the form of green dots. The raw data are discrete, but we left it in the form of a
continuous line to highlight the structure and avoid confusion.

Reviewer #2
Reviewer #2 finds that the manuscript relates very interesting results on the emergence of structure of exploratory
behaviour in the vertical dimension. This reviewer focuses on making several suggestions regarding the issues to
be discussed:
1. I note that the authors have used BALB/C mice in the study, how generalizable do they think these results
will be to the C57Bl6 mouse strain?
This issue has been addressed in detail in the response to major comments 7 and 8 of reviewers #1. We have at
hand preliminary observations of C57Bl and wild mice, as well as other strains, all abiding by the regularities we
describe for BALB/c mice. Unfortunately, however, these results still have not been digitized and analyzed, and
therefore, while we are tempted to mention these results, we feel that we are not entitled at this stage to claim
generalizability across the mouse species.
2. The fact that exploration along the top of the circular enclosure seems to develop in the absence of
reference to the doorway to the home cage is intriguing, especially as in previous work the group had
demonstrated that trips along the edge of the circular environment (the floor of the enclosure) were made
with reference to the doorway, while excursions to the middle of the enclosure were not. Could the authors
venture any more ideas as to why the top of the circular enclosure is not treated like the bottom, but,
possibly, as an extension of the middle of the enclosure? What implications this would have for the
gathering of allocentric spatial information?
We thank the reviewer for alerting us to this issue. We now added in the discussion the following paragraph: "In
this study we show that the mice first use the doorway as a point reference for establishing familiarity with the
lower circumference; once established, the lower circumference is used as a line reference for the performance of
incursions and ascents. A similar situation of hierarchically nested references has been reported in the exploration
of a room by an infant rat during repeated daily exposures [Error! Reference source not found.]: the infant first
establishes a home base in a specific corner, using subsequent corners as secondary home bases to which it returns
frequently while also returning from time to time to the first main home base. This is perhaps why the mouse
exploring the upper circumference first relates to the lower circumference and not to the doorway".

3. In the paradigm employed, the mice are kept for a period up to 48 hours (adaptation and behaviour
recording) under IR lighting conditions. Is this correct? Could the authors explain why this was done and
if they expect completely different results under ‘normal’ lighting conditions? The more general question
is: does changing the sensory channel through which information can be gathered, change the patterns of
exploratory behaviour? Presumably under IR lighting, BALB/c mice would mainly rely on olfaction/tactile
and auditory inputs.
As explained above, in response to comments 7 and 8 of reviewer #1, when our experimental arena is lit the mice
typically do not come out of the dark home-cage for days. Using IR lighting was therefore an experimental
constraint imposed by our requirement of deliberate exploration. As explained, in our own work we focused on
describing the baseline of vertical behaviour, which can now be used to examine different sensory effects.
Extensive work involving different sensory deprivations has been conducted by IQ Whishaw and colleagues on rat
home base behaviour, showing that this behaviour is performed by rodents in complete darkness as well as under
light conditions and following bulbectomy, essentially involving the use of proprioceptive information ("dead
reckoning") during navigation.

Reviewer #3
Reviewer #3 thinks that the issue of studying, behaviourally, the exploratory patterns of animals in horizontal vs.
vertical spatial dimensions is important, but his enthusiasm for this particular study is limited.
In the present version we expand the scope of the paper to include not only a description of exploratory behaviour
in the vertical dimension, but also the context in which it is performed in a three dimensional space. We now show
that both incursions and ascents are performed in bouts, i.e. the mouse's attention to each dimension is sustained for
a substantial amount of time rather than shifting haphazardly from one dimension to the next, exposing
dimensional modularity. By demonstrating this phenomenon we show that the mice have a robust intrinsic
organization of movement, in terms of three dimensional subsystems. From our vantage point this is an important
advance, and we hope that the reviewer will share our view.
Comments:
1. The movements were tracked with a single overhead camera which means that the sampling of movements
on the wall required substantial inference – for example “high horizontal speed implies movement on the
floor.”
The mice can and do reach very high speeds during running on the ground, by an order of magnitude higher than
those exhibited during horizontal movement on the wire mesh. We use this fact to obtain a clear cut high resolution
separation between movement on the floor and movement on the wire mesh. This enables us to precisely isolate
ascents, even if they are as small as a rearing episode. We now clarify this misunderstanding in Materials and
Methods. We also added an illustration (supplementary Figure S3) demonstrating the fine distinction we obtain
between the floor and the wall.
Given that the position of the mouse at any point on the wire mesh is observable by a single overhead camera, a
proper transformation is sufficient to accurately measure the movement. An addition of one or more cameras (a
setup such as Noldus Track3D) would also be subject to inference to ensure proper transformations and accurate
measurements, and would be superfluous in the current study.
2. No causal hypotheses were tested, and only the one environment was studied so we do not know to what
the extent the patterns seen here would generalize to environments in general.
This issue has been addressed in our response to comments 7 and 8 of reviewer #1, and is now clarified in the
discussion, in the section An ethologically relevant setting. Addressing the effect of the wire mesh orientation on
the pattern of movement has now been added to Materials and Methods, in the section Animals, Experimental
Setup and Testing Protocol and Analysis.

3. One more issue to consider is how much of the pattern of unfolding could be due simply to the mice
learning to climb? If they have been cage-housed they may not be skilled at first – so the procedural versus
exploratory components of the behavior should be teased apart.
The issue of learning to climb has also been addressed in our response to comments 7 and 8 of reviewer #1. We
also address this issue in Materials and Methods, in the section Animals, Experimental Setup and Testing Protocol
and Analysis.
4. All in all, I feel this study is a little too limited to allow general useful conclusions about 3D exploration to
be drawn.
We disagree: however limited this study is, we do show that vertical movement, not unlike a living tissue,
undergoes a process of growth and differentiation from simple to complex; we do show that this process is
equivalent in three separate modular subspaces (borderline movement, incursions and ascents); we do show that the
mice focus their attention on each of these modular subspaces for sustained intervals; and we do map the sequences
of references or attractors used by the mice across the session, from the doorway (point reference), through the
arena border (line reference). This allows us to formulate general rules which validate the conclusions regarding
vertical exploration as a separate subspace, and 3D exploration as a whole.
5. Apart from their own papers, which they cite quite a lot, there is also a literature on exploratory behavior
that was not explored (e.g., Whishaw and Brooks, 1999; Wallace et al., 2002; Kazlauckas et al., 2005;
Whishaw et al., 2006; Nemati and Whishaw, 2007) as well horizontal vs vertical behavioural patterns
(Grobéty and Schenk, 1992a, 1992b; Moghaddam et al., 1996; Bardunias and Jander, 2000; Jovalekic et
al., 2011).
We thank the reviewer for suggesting to quote Grobety and Schenk (1992a and 1992b) and Moghaddam et al.
(1996), who demonstrate the importance of the vertical dimension in enhancing spatial orientation in a rodent. We
carefully examined the relevance of all the other suggested references, but could not find a way to cite them
without distracting the readers from the subject of this paper, which is the description of the morphological growth
and differentiation of exploration along the vertical dimension.
Sincerely yours,
