This study describes an analysis in which the origin of chickens in Madagascar is assessed based
on partial sequences of the mitochondrial control region from various regions in Africa and Asia
as well as from Madagascar. The authors used an alignment of a truncated part of this gene
region to derive haplotype networks, compute Fst values, median joining networks, pairwise
genetic distances between haplotypes, and haplotype D only and principal component analysis,
as well as intra-population genetic variation and population expansion statistics. In general, the
manuscript is well written and understandable, the analyses are performed correctly and the
conclusions made on the basis of the data that was used are correct.
This is the second time that I review this manuscript, my previous main criticism was the lack of
clarity as to the contribution of sequences made by the authors. This has now been clarified by
indicating this in the supplementary accessions table, but there are a number of other issues that I
wish to raise:
1. On the map showing the haplotype distributions of the samples from each of the countries, the
circles shown for the position on the African continent are inaccurate, the circle for Kenya is
placed where Ethiopia is, for Nigeria where Mali is and for Zimbabwe where Zambia is.
Particularly the positioning of the circle of Kenya is important because of its proximity to
Madagascar.
2. The authors state that they sequence the full 764 bp mitochondrial control region but then
truncate their data set to 349 bp. It is very important to state which part of the 764 bp region this
349 bp fragment corresponds to, this should be specified with the base pair numbering that the
349 bp fragment corresponds to in the whole region. Without this information, this study is
actually meaningless, because without it, no comparison can be made to other studies employing
mitochondrial control region sequences.
3. In their assigment of haplotypes, the authors find that the most common haplotype on
Madagascar is the D haplotype. In Kenya they find the D haplotype and the E haplotype. In the
study of East African chickens by Mwacharo et al., 2011, these authors find a D haplotype and an
A haplotype in Kenya. I conclude that the D haplotype of Mwacharo et al corresponds to the D
haplotype identified in this study, but has the A haplotype of Mwacharo been assigned the name
of an E haplotype in this study? Again this needs to be clarified or else the study cannot be
compared.
4. In the study of Mwacharo et al., 2011, their analyses included Ethiopian chickens and they
found that some of the haplotypes found there were related to haplotypes from China. Why
were the sequence data from Ethiopia not included in this study as well? Mwacharo et al.
proposed that the origins of the chickens from Ethiopia were likely to have come from China
through ancient exchanges. If this data was included in the present analysis, would this not have
an influence on the conclusions that could be drawn from it? If the sequence data from Ethiopia
did not correspond to the truncated region included in this study, then its exclusion would be
logical, but again this emphasizes the importance of specifying which part of the gene was
included in the present analysis. If the sequence data from Ethiopia does correspond to the region
analysed here, to which haplotype would it correspond, and would it then not allow a different
interpretation of the origins of Malagasy chickens to the one made in this study?

My criticism of the manuscript is that the analysis is based on a 349 bp fragment of the MtDNA
control region which is different to the region that other authors have analysed. This gives a
different result and leads to a different conclusion to that obtained by other authors. As a result
this gives an alternative hypothesis, and this has merits for publication. However, before robust
conclusions can really be made, far more seqeunce data needs to be incorporated in such
analyses, and the conclusions can only be viewed to be preliminary.

thank the reviewer for his continued efforts to improve the clarity and quality of our
nuscript. We have revised the manuscript (now for a second time) taking into account
reviewers comments, as outlined below. Unfortunately, the reviewers comment
arding how our analysis relates to the Mwacharo et al paper and data are not possible to
l with completely because Mwacharo et al did not make all of their sequence data
ilable on Genbank. However, we do not believe that inclusion of this missing data would
nge the overall results supporting an African origin for Madagascan chickens.
iewer: 1
mments to the Author(s)
mment 1. On the map showing the haplotype distributions of the samples from each of
countries, the circles shown for the position on the African continent are inaccurate, the
le for Kenya is placed where Ethiopia is, for Nigeria where Mali is and for Zimbabwe
ere Zambia is. Particularly the positioning of the circle of Kenya is important because of
proximity to Madagascar.
ponse 1: We have redrawn figure 1 (the map) and corrected the locations of all the pie
rts to accurately reflect their geographic locations.
mment 2. The authors state that they sequence the full 764 bp mitochondrial control
ion but then truncate their data set to 349 bp. It is very important to state which part of
764 bp region this 349 bp fragment corresponds to, this should be specified with the
e pair numbering that the 349 bp fragment corresponds to in the whole region. Without
information, this study is actually meaningless, because without it, no comparison can
made to other studies employing mitochondrial control region sequences.
ponse 2. We have added extra details in the methods, identifying the nucleotide
itions for the amplified fragment and the truncated 349 bp fragment so that it is now
ar where these are. See lines 143-144 and 157-158. Obviously the 349 bp fragment sits
hin the 760 bp fragment.
mment 3. In their assigment of haplotypes, the authors find that the most common
lotype on Madagascar is the D haplotype. In Kenya they find the D haplotype and the E
lotype. In the study of East African chickens by Mwacharo et al., 2011, these authors
a D haplotype and an A haplotype in Kenya. I conclude that the D haplotype of
acharo et al corresponds to the D haplotype identified in this study, but has the A
lotype of Mwacharo been assigned the name of an E haplotype in this study? Again this
ds to be clarified or else the study cannot be compared.
ponse 3. Unfortunately the Mwacharo et al. 2011 paper only made 159 of 512
uences publically available on GenBank, and all of these were from Kenya (thus no data
ilable for their samples from Ethiopia, Sudan and Uganda). We have tried, without
cess, to obtain the missing sequences from the authors. Therefore it is very difficult to
oncile the results of Mwacharo, with our own analysis, especially since they appear to
e used a different nomenclature system for their haplogroups. We have followed the
logroup naming system of Miao et al 2013 which is now the standard (or at least most
espread) system for chicken mtDNA haplogroups. According to Mwacharo et al.'s Suppl
le 2 their haplogroup D corresponds to our haplogroup E, and their haplogroup A
responds to our haplogroup D. Mwacharo reported haplogroup D and A from Kenya, but
ur analysis the available 159 sequences from Kenya fall into haplogroups E and D,
sistent with Mwacharo's Table S2. We have tried to discuss this issue in a number of
ces in the manuscript, but it is difficult to do so convincingly because so many of
acharo's sequences are not available.
mment 4a. In the study of Mwacharo et al., 2011, their analyses included Ethiopian
ckens and they found that some of the haplotypes found there were related to haplotypes
m China. Why were the sequence data from Ethiopia not included in this study as well?
ponse 4a. As discussed above Mwacharo did not include all of their sequences on
nbank and we have been unable to source the sequences directly from the authors. We
e included text in the Methods and Table legends to indicate this
mment 4b. Mwacharo et al. proposed that the origins of the chickens from Ethiopia were
ly to have come from China through ancient exchanges. If this data was included in the
sent analysis, would this not have an influence on the conclusions that could be drawn
m it?
ponse 4b. Possibly, but as the data is unavailable we cannot comment further. Our
ults are primarily focused on the origins of Madagascan chickens - the available data
ports an East African origin for Madagascan chickens.
mment 4c. If the sequence data from Ethiopia did not correspond to the truncated region
uded in this study, then its exclusion would be logical, but again this emphasizes the
ortance of specifying which part of the gene was included in the present analysis. If the
uence data from Ethiopia does correspond to the region analysed here, to which
lotype would it correspond, and would it then not allow a different interpretation of the
ins of Malagasy chickens to the one made in this study?
ponse 4c. Possibly, but as the data is unavailable so we cannot say anything definitively.
wever, Mwacharo's Suppl Table 2 shows that they found only haplogroup D (which we
E) in Ethiopia, with two single occurences of haplogroup E (what we would call F) and C
at we would call B) in Ethiopia. Given that we found only D and E in Madagascar, we
t think that inclusion of the missing sequences from Mwacharo would change the
ults.
