This highly abraded specimen is a premolar of a mammaliaform, but I do not think it is possible
to identify it more precisely than that. It may well belong to a tribosphenidan, as the authors
contend, but it could be many other things as well. Even if it is a tribosphenidan, it contributes
nothing new to knowledge, particularly in view of the fact that the radiometric dating is itself
uninformative. Whatever the case, naming a new taxon to contain this specimen would be
unsupportable. Whatever the authors do, I beg them not to inflict the scientific community with
this ill-conceived idea. This paper merits publication as a note in a regional venue, if and only if
the authors agree not to name it. It does not belong in a national or international journal.

I congratulate the authors for this important finding of a tribosphenic mammal which improves
the fossil record of this mammalian group from the Gondwanan continents, though marginally.
The manuscript of Castro et al. is well organized and illustrated. It is an important addition to the
diversity of tribosphenic mammals from the former Gondwanaland. The title and abstract are
informative. The conclusions are well supported by comparison with a wide range of taxa,
enamel ultrastructure and elemental analysis of the tooth, and the age of the mammal yielding
3
horizon has been fairly well constrained using U-Pb chronology in conjunction with fossil data
from the beds above and below. The references are relevant and current.
The interpretation of the tooth as a tribosphenic premolar of possible Gondwanan origin is
conceivable. It is good that the authors refrained from performing any phylogenetic analysis
using only two characters of a poorly preserved premolar. My other comments are as follows.
Page 2, Lines 52-53 – My only reservation is about naming a new genus and species based on a
poorly preserved specimen. I think the holotype should be based on a better preserved specimen.
Page 5, lines 18-20 – “It is worth mentioning that later revisions of Cretaceous mammals of India
(e.g. [58] [94 of Supplementary Material) attribute lower premolars to Deccanolestes that are
morphologically different from that referred to its type species of the genus [6]” – I think it is an
incorrect statement as the premolars described in Prasad & Sahni (1988) [6], Prasad & Khajuria
(1990) [57], and Prasad et al. (1994) [59] are not different from those described in [58, S94] except
for better preservation in the latter case. The lower p3 described in these works differ from that of
B. stardusti in having two talonid cusps - one cusp positioned posterolingually to the main cusp
and a second one located posterolabial to the former and the two cusps are connected by a crest.
Whereas the inferred p2 in [58, S94] has a single talonid cusp. However, a left dentary referred to
Deccanolestes hislopi (Kapur et al., 2017, fig. 8) has a p3 with a single talonid cusp.
Final recommendation: I enjoyed reading the manuscript and recommend that the article by
Castro et al be published as it currently is with minor corrections suggested in the annotated pdf
file.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
Their assessment of the age seems fine. It is unambiguously Late Cretaceous in age. Their
assessment that it is a mammal is also quite firm. The poor quality of the tooth precludes a more
definitive identification, although I am inclined to think it is Theria incertae sedis, or if you wish a
stem therian resembling more stem eutherians than stem metatherians. If anything, their
assignment only to Tribospenida is conservative, which is fine. I do point out that it could not as
they write differ “from other known mammals” or one could not argue it is a tribosphenid. I do
believe they were too enamored with only comparing to Gondwanan taxa. They need to look at
Laurasian taxa from N. America, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, and China, if nothing else to say how
their tooth differs. As to whether the specimens should be formally named, I say yes. If it came
from some other well-known LK mammalian fauna it would likely be labelled indeterminate. But
coming from a very new area for such finds, a formal name helps in communicating this fact
rather than calling it something nebulous like the Adamantina premolar, which becomes lost in
future studies. In addition to the above needed additional comparisons, someone with better
English needs to clean up the paper. I am not interested in doing so. If these
additions/corrections are addressed, I would favor publication.

Subject Editor Comments to Author:
We have a deeply split panel of reviewers. One generally approves but offers little in the way of
substantive comments. Another feels that the identification is unsustainable and that the
specimen should not be named. A third thinks that it may be worth naming but there should be
more comparison to other known mammaliaforms of the Period, and that the identification
should be reconsidered and refined. Because these revisions may require more time than allotted
to our "revise" timeline, it seems better to reject and allow a resubmission -- provided that the
comments of all reviewers are satisfactorily addressed. Thanks for submitting.

“A Late Cretaceous Mammal from Brazil and the First Radioisotopic Age for the Bauru Group”
Castro, Mariela et al. for Royal Society Open Science.
Merit
This paper reports a discovery of a new fossil mammal tooth from the Cretaceous Adamantina
Formation and a geochronological dating of the Adamantina Formation at >87.8 million years
(post Turonian age). The newly discovered fossil is a lower molar, which is usually less
diagnostic than the molars. But the authors are also appropriately cautious and circumspective.
They went to a great length to compare this lower premolar with those of many known
Cretaceous mammal clades, but refrained from any premature conclusion about its taxonomic
assignment. The final conclusion that it is a Tribosphenidan mammal, incertae sedis is
appropriate.
Although a single premolar is inconclusive in the more explicit taxonomic identification, this new
discovery of a Cretaceous tribosphenidan in South America should be published. It is certainly a
useful datum point for continent-wide correlation to publish the 87.8 ma date of the Adamantina
Formation.
Overall I support that Royal Society Open Science publishes this paper.
The manuscript is also written in good English and with very extensive morphological
comparison. The current manuscript does not need any major revision.
However, I have some miscellaneous corrections. These corrections can be easily made, and I do
not believe it would need to be re-reviewed after the corrections.

of all reviewers are satisfactorily addressed. Thanks for submitting.
WE CONCUR WITH THE SUBJECT EDITOR THAT THE PANEL OF REVIEWERS IS SPLIT. IN THIS SENSE,
THE EXTREMELY UNFAVORABLE COMMENTS OF REVIEWER 1 (MOSTLY CONTRADICTED BY THE
OTHER REVIEWS) ARE ALL ADDRESSED BELOW. THE FEW SUGGESTIONS OF REVIEWER 2, MAINLY
RELATED TO THE MORPHOLOGY OF P3 OF DECCANOLESTES, WERE IMPLEMENTED. LASTLY, WE
INTERPRET THAT REVIEWER 3 BELIEVES THAT OUR TAXONOMIC IDENTIFICATION IS ADEQUATE,
ALTHOUGH CONSERVATIVE IN HIS/HER OPINION; THE REQUESTED COMPARISONS TO LAURASIAN
TAXA WERE ALREADY PRESENT IN THE ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.

Comments to the Author(s)
This highly abraded specimen is a premolar of a mammaliaform, but I do not think it is possible to
identify it more precisely than that. It may well belong to a tribosphenidan, as the authors contend,
but it could be many other things as well. Even if it is a tribosphenidan, it contributes nothing new to
knowledge, particularly in view of the fact that the radiometric dating is itself uninformative.
Whatever the case, naming a new taxon to contain this specimen would be unsupportable.
Whatever the authors do, I beg them not to inflict the scientific community with this ill-conceived
idea. This paper merits publication as a note in a regional venue, if and only if the authors agree not
to name it. It does not belong in a national or international journal.
MOST OF THE COMMENTS OF REVIEWER 1 ARE NOT SHARED BY THE OTHER REVIEWERS.
ON THE ASSERTION THAT THE SPECIMEN “CONTRIBUTES NOTHING NEW TO KNOWLEDGE,
PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE RADIOMETRIC DATING IS ITSELF UNINFORMATIVE”,
WE FEEL THIS IS NOT THE CASE. AS MENTIONED IN THE MANUSCRIPT, RECORDS OF MAMMALS IN
THE CRETACEOUS OF GONDWANA ARE VERY RARE (AS SHOWN IN OUR FIGURE 3), AND THE
RADIOMETRIC DATING IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND FOR THE BAURU GROUP, FACING UP TO
INCONSISTENT AGE ESTIMATIONS BASED ON BIOCHRONOLOGY AND RULING OUT A PRE-CONIACIAN
AGE.
AS FOR THE TAXONOMY, REVIEWER 2 AGREES WITH THE ATTRIBUTION OF THE NEW SPECIMEN TO
TRIBOSPHENIDA, WHEREAS REVIEWER 3 GOES A LITTLE BIT FURTHER, AS HE/SHE IS “INCLINED TO
THINK IT IS THERIA INCERTAE SEDIS, OR IF YOU WISH A STEM THERIAN RESEMBLING MORE STEM
EUTHERIANS THAN STEM METATHERIANS. IF ANYTHING, THEIR ASSIGNMENT ONLY TO
TRIBOSPENIDA IS CONSERVATIVE, WHICH IS FINE”. ALSO, TWO SPECIALISTS ON CRETACEOUS
MAMMALS (NAMELY, Z-X LUO AND G. ROUGIER) HAD ACCESS TO PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THE
MANUSCRIPT AND CONCUR WITH THE IDENTIFICATION.
WITH RESPECT TO NAMING THE NEW SPECIMEN, REVIEWER 3 PROVIDES AN ELEGANT
JUSTIFICATION FOR DOING SO (WHICH IS VERY CLOSE TO OUR OWN): “IF IT CAME FROM SOME
OTHER WELL-KNOWN LK MAMMALIAN FAUNA IT WOULD LIKELY BE LABELLED INDETERMINATE. BUT
COMING FROM A VERY NEW AREA FOR SUCH FINDS, A FORMAL NAME HELPS IN COMMUNICATING
THIS FACT RATHER THAN CALLING IT SOMETHING NEBULOUS LIKE THE ADAMANTINA PREMOLAR,
WHICH BECOMES LOST IN FUTURE STUDIES”.
FINALLY, ON THE SUITABILITY OF THE MANUSCRIPT TO AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL, REVIEWER 2
RECOMMENDED IT TO BE PUBLISHED AS IT CURRENTLY IS WITH MINOR CORRECTIONS, AND
REVIEWER 3 FAVORED THE PUBLICATION IF HIS/HER ADDITIONS/CORRECTIONS WERE ADDRESSED
(WHAT WE HAVE DONE).

Comments to the Author(s)
I congratulate the authors for this important finding of a tribosphenic mammal which improves the
fossil record of this mammalian group from the Gondwanan continents, though marginally.
The manuscript of Castro et al. is well organized and illustrated. It is an important addition to the
diversity of tribosphenic mammals from the former Gondwanaland. The title and abstract are
informative. The conclusions are well supported by comparison with a wide range of taxa, enamel
ultrastructure and elemental analysis of the tooth, and the age of the mammal yielding horizon has
been fairly well constrained using U-Pb chronology in conjunction with fossil data from the beds
above and below. The references are relevant and current.
The interpretation of the tooth as a tribosphenic premolar of possible Gondwanan origin is
conceivable. It is good that the authors refrained from performing any phylogenetic analysis using
only two characters of a poorly preserved premolar. My other comments are as follows.
Page 2, Lines 52-53 – My only reservation is about naming a new genus and species based on a
poorly preserved specimen. I think the holotype should be based on a better preserved specimen.
WE DECIDED TO NAME THE TAXON BECAUSE OF THE RARITY OF CRETACEOUS MAMMALS IN
NORTHERN PARTS OF SOUTH AMERICA (I.E. OUTSIDE PATAGONIA). DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF
SEVERAL RESEARCH TEAMS WORKING FOR DECADES IN THE BAURU GROUP (SOME ACTIVELY
LOOKING FOR MICROREMAINS), ONLY TWO SPECIMENS WERE FOUND (THAT STUDIED BY BERTINI
ET AL. 1993 AND THAT PRESENTED IN OUR WORK). AS POINTED OUT BY REVIEWER 3, “COMING
FROM A VERY NEW AREA FOR SUCH FINDS, A FORMAL NAME HELPS IN COMMUNICATING THIS FACT
RATHER THAN CALLING IT SOMETHING NEBULOUS LIKE THE ADAMANTINA PREMOLAR, WHICH
BECOMES LOST IN FUTURE STUDIES”.
Page 5, lines 18-20 – “It is worth mentioning that later revisions of Cretaceous mammals of India
(e.g. [58] [94 of Supplementary Material) attribute lower premolars to Deccanolestes that are
morphologically different from that referred to its type species of the genus [6]” – I think it is an
incorrect statement as the premolars described in Prasad & Sahni (1988) [6], Prasad & Khajuria
(1990) [57], and Prasad et al. (1994) [59] are not different from those described in [58, S94] except
for better preservation in the latter case. The lower p3 described in these works differ from that of
B. stardusti in having two talonid cusps - one cusp positioned posterolingually to the main cusp and a
second one located posterolabial to the former and the two cusps are connected by a crest.
Whereas the inferred p2 in [58, S94] has a single talonid cusp. However, a left dentary referred to
Deccanolestes hislopi (Kapur et al., 2017, fig. 8) has a p3 with a single talonid cusp.
THE MENTIONED SENTENCE WAS SUPPRESSED, AS IT WAS BASED ON PUBLISHED FIGURES, NOT ON
FIRST-HAND OBSERVATIONS, AS IS THE CASE FOR DR. PRASAD. WE ALSO ADDED THE INFORMATION
ON THE PRESENCE OF TALONID CUSPS AND THE REFERENCE TO THE PAPER OF KAPUR ET AL. (2017).
Final recommendation: I enjoyed reading the manuscript and recommend that the article by Castro
et al be published as it currently is with minor corrections suggested in the annotated pdf file.
ALL MINOR CORRECTIONS SUGGESTED IN THE ANNOTATED PDF FILE WERE IMPLEMENTED.

Comments to the Author(s)
Their assessment of the age seems fine. It is unambiguously Late Cretaceous in age. Their
assessment that it is a mammal is also quite firm. The poor quality of the tooth precludes a more
definitive identification, although I am inclined to think it is Theria incertae sedis, or if you wish a
stem therian resembling more stem eutherians than stem metatherians. If anything, their
assignment only to Tribospenida is conservative, which is fine. I do point out that it could not as they
write differ “from other known mammals” or one could not argue it is a tribosphenid. I do believe
they were too enamored with only comparing to Gondwanan taxa. They need to look at Laurasian
taxa from N. America, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, and China, if nothing else to say how their tooth differs.
As to whether the specimens should be formally named, I say yes. If it came from some other well-
known LK mammalian fauna it would likely be labelled indeterminate. But coming from a very new
area for such finds, a formal name helps in communicating this fact rather than calling it something
nebulous like the Adamantina premolar, which becomes lost in future studies. In addition to the
above needed additional comparisons, someone with better English needs to clean up the paper. I
am not interested in doing so. If these additions/corrections are addressed, I would favor
publication.
WE ARE ALSO INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE SPECIMEN RESEMBLES MORE EUTHERIANS THAN
METATHERIANS. HOWEVER, WE STILL PREFERRED TO BE CONSERVATIVE.
WE DID NOT COMPARE THE SPECIMEN ONLY TO GONDWANAN TAXA. ALTHOUGH COMPARISONS IN
THE MAIN TEXT ARE MORE FOCUSED ON DECCANOLESTES (LATE CRETACEOUS OF INDIA) DUE TO
THEIR MORPHOLOGICAL SIMILARITIES, WE ALSO MENTIONED GROUPS (I.E., EUTRICONODONTA,
ALLOTHERIA, “SYMMETRODONTA”, “EUPANTOTHERIA”) AND PARTICULAR GENERA (NANOLESTES,
FROM THE LATE JURASSIC OF CHINA AND PORTUGAL; SLAUGHTERIA, FROM THE EARLY CRETACEOUS
OF UNITED STATES) FROM LAURASIA. MORE IMPORTANTLY, AN EXPANDED COMPARISON OF
BRASILESTES CAN BE FOUND IN THE ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL. IN THIS FILE,
ADDITIONAL COMPARISONS WITH TAXA FROM NORTH AMERICA, MONGOLIA, UZBEKISTAN, CHINA,
AND OTHER LAURASIAN LANDMASSES (E.G., MONTANALESTES, CIMOLESTES, KENNALESTES,
GYPSONYCTOPS, ASPANLESTES, PARANYCTOIDES, JURAMAIA, PROKENNALESTES, EOMAIA,
ZALAMBDALESTES, ETC.) ARE DRAWN. IT COULD BE THE CASE THAT REVIEWER 3 DID NOT HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO ANALYZE THIS FILE. THE PRESENCE OF THIS EXPANDED COMPARISON IN THE
ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL IS NOW CLEARLY STATED IN THE MAIN TEXT, AND WE
ALSO ADDED AGE AND LOCALITY OF EACH GENUS THAT IS MENTIONED IN THE COMPARISON.
WE HAD THE MANUSCRIPT REVIEWED BY ANOTHER ENGLISH NATIVE SPEAKER.
Appendix B
April 19, 2018
Dear Dr. Kevin Padian
Subject Editor of Royal Society Open Science
Please find enclosed the reviewed version of the manuscript entitled “A Late Cretaceous mammal
from Brazil and the first radioisotopic age for the Bauru Group”, which we respectfully submit for
consideration as a Research Article in Royal Society Open Society.
We would like to thank you and the reviewers for the attention addressed to our manuscript.
The corrections of Reviewer 4 were all implemented.
Concerning the criticism of Reviewer 3 that we “buried comparisons with appropriate Laurasian taxa
in the supplementary material rather than discussing them in the main text”, we respectfully
disagree. Comparisons with appropriate Laurasian and Gondwanan taxa are included both in the
main text and in the Electronic Supplementary Material. In fact, the same major taxa (i.e.,
Australosphenida, Eutriconodonta, Allotheria, “Symmetrodonta”, “Eupantotheria”, Metatheria, and
Eutheria) are cited in those two files. The same applies to genera that show some morphological
similarity with Brasilestes stardusti (i.e., Deccanolestes, Nanolestes, Slaughtheria, Naboryctes, and
Gypsonyctops) or present enamel reduction (i.e, the palaeanodonts Ernanodon, Melaniella,
Tubulodon, and Mylanodon, as well as the xenarthrans Astegotherium, Utaetus, and Dasypus),
either from Laurasia or Gondwana. The difference in the ESM file is that more genera are employed
as examples, and the chronological and geographical distribution of each is explicitly given. This
information was added to the previous version the manuscript following a comment of Reviewer 3
[“I do believe they were too enamored with only comparing to Gondwanan taxa. They need to look
at Laurasian taxa from N. America, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, and China, if nothing else to say how their
tooth differs”] with the aim of clarifying that several Laurasian taxa were already included in the
comparisons, both in the main text and the ESM. Those comparisons sum up approximately 2.5
pages of the ESM and 1.5 pages of the main text (out of 5 pages). As indicated by RSOS, our
manuscript was written in a way to attract a broader audience, including readers interested in the
geochronology of the Bauru Group and other South American deposits, enamel
microstrutcture/reduction, the taxonomical affinities of the newly found mammal, and the
corresponding biogeographical implications. In our view, most readers are willing to see that we
compared our specimen to several taxonomical groups and which are the main differences that we
found. This information is present in the main text. Including the more extensive morphological
comparison available in the ESM, as requested by Reviewer 3, is a simple task. However, we believe
that this will bury most readers in too specific taxonomical/morphological discussions. Nonetheless,
if the editor concludes that inserting the expanded comparison in the main text is more appropriate,
we can do so.
Yours sincerely,
Mariela C. Castro, on behalf of all authors
