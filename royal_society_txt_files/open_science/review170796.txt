Review of the manuscript titled “Benthic communities under anthropogenic pressure show
resilience across 1 the Quaternary” by Julieta C. Martinelli, Luis P. Soto, Jorge Gonzalez &
Marcelo M. Rivadeneira that is being considered for publication in Royal Society Open Sciences
This research report assemble collected and literature data for carrying out an explicit
quantitative investigation of long-term responses of marine benthic ecosystems affected by
naturally occurring climate oscillations and, during last 20 years potential threat, from human
induced activities (aquaculture/farming) of a economically relevant taxon.
The results of comparative quantitative analyses (based on >690 samples and >33000 mollusk
specimens) reveal a remarkable resilience of marine benthic communities to major
climate/environmental and anthropogenic perturbations that took place across the Quaternary in
Togoy Bay (Chile).
Although similar stability has been documented in many studies throughout the Quaternary,
several aspects of this study are particularly noteworthy. First, as the authors point out, the
relatively recent age of this study serves as a baseline for evaluating future anthropogenic
changes in marine systems. Second, the authors consider a broad range of descriptors of the
structure of this communities, including diversity and similarity indices and abundance (rank
and relative). Third, this should be one of the few investigations concerning Conservation
Paleobiology for South America.
The study is in good shape and the methods employed are novel and interesting. See below my
comments on the chapters (few additional on a marked copy of the manuscript here attached):
Abstract:
lines 33-34 Extirpated. However from fig. 4B it seems that Mulinia is found alive in the Bay or
neighboring bays. Suggest to modify the sentence.
Results
Line 232 …..and what about the body size during MP. Is there any possible explanation for the
reduced (the lowest) body size in the Middle Pleistocene? I was not able to find a sentence
concerning that piece of information.
Lines 236-238 …… please ckeck the sentence, as from the wisker plot of fig. 4 I do not see any
difference from MP and LP or younger age stages.
Discussion
Lines 245-246. Judging from figure 4B, Mulinia is still present alive in the investigated area. So I
suggest not to consider it extirpated or locally extinct...perhaps….. rare.
Lines 248-249 this sentence is quite generic. Is there any detected environmental change during
the last few millennia? Beside Mulina was showed low abundances also during the Middle
Pleistocene. Any specific explanation for low abundance during MP?
Antropogenic impacts should be better delineated, farming Argopecten does have an impact (or
not) on the Mulina biotope? Finally, any widespread disease affected Mulina during the present
day?
I suggest to add here a reference to the (sub)chapters where the authors deal with the above
mentioned questions.
3
Line 253.
I suggest to insert one or two sentences on the fact that this is not the scope of the manuscript, as
it would imply a set of paleoenvrionmental reconstructions performed to identify major
environmental drivers of faunal turnovers. Beside it would require a more refined sequence
stratigraphic framework of sampled fossil successions. As stratigraphic biases migh play a strong
overprint on macrobenthic records (e.g., diversity-->Scarponi and Kowalewski, 2007 Palaios, as
for time averaging --> Scarponi et al. 2013- Geology)
Lines 276-307 I suggest to add a statement, concerning the low abundance of Mulinia during
Middle Pleistocene. Perhaps, evironmental settings of the MP sampled succession could provide
qualitative/quantitative insights on major environmental drivers of Mulinia abundance.
Line 277 see my previous comment on locally extinct and fig. 4
Line 280 and/or
Line 334 is recovery connected to human induced aquaculture and fishing overexploitation
during late ‘80?
if so it should pertain to the modern live and dead assemblages and not on the middle, late
Pleistocene and Holocene.
Figure 4 in Fig. 4B Mulinia is reported alive in modern environments. However in the text,
Mulinia is reported as extirpated from Tongoy Bay.
This could be confusing and should be clarified. Are live collected Mulinia are from neighbouring
bays (if so please specify it here) or Mulina is not locally extinct but only extremely rare in Togon
Bay?In the latter case, the text should be modified accordingly.
Fig. 4 line 647-649 this sentence is not necessary here. I would erase as already stated in the text.
Fig. 4 lines 449-450 please explain the meaning of the box plots. E.g., wat the top and bottom of
the box stand for, and what the thick horizontal line represents ....., wiskers ..... and dots indicate

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This paper is a straightforward and well-designed study that gives clear and concise views on
molluscan community structure across the fossil record and into the modern realm. The authors
present a compelling and convincing analysis of their methodically collected data that I think is
relevant and appropriate for RSOS. I found very few grammatical errors and the manuscript is
well-written and very easy to follow. I recommend that this paper be accepted as is.
I only have two minor comments about the methods: 1) For the fossil samples collected - were
these lithified or unlithified samples? I am asking this because this will affect the analyses in the
paper when compared to unlithified live-dead community. I think there just needs to be a
clarifying statement about the nature of the fossil samples (sieved or bulk). 2) For your bivalve
counts did you account for 2 valves=1 individual? I am sure that the authors did, but it would be
good to have this protocol included in the methods so that readers know that there is not
inflation in the bivalve counts.
Overall, the authors demonstrate methodical data collection that is very straightforward and easy
to follow. They perform reasonable and appropriate analyses to explain their data and their
interpretations of their results are sound.

Appendix A
Dear Prof. Kevin Padian,
Thank you very much for your and the reviewers' time and suggestions to improve the quality
of the manuscript. All the comments have been taken into consideration and addressed below.
Our point-by-point response to the reviewers’ comments is as follows:
Reviewer 1
Abstract:
lines 33-34 Extirpated. However from fig. 4B it seems that Mulinia is found alive in the Bay
or neighboring bays. Suggest to modify the sentence.
Reply: The reviewer has a valid point. The sentence was modified to ‘Mulinia is locally very
rare’. Now line 33.
Results
Line 232 …..and what about the body size during MP. Is there any possible explanation for
the reduced (the lowest) body size in the Middle Pleistocene? I was not able to find a
sentence concerning that piece of information.
Reply: The reviewer has a valid point. The sentence now reads: ‘The clam Mulinia shows a
significant decrease in body size from the HOL to the DA as well as between MP and all the
other time bins’. Lines 230-231.
Regarding the body size during the MP we can only offer speculations based on the uplift
rates of marine terraces in the area during the MP. According to Saillard et al. 2009, uplift
rates in Tongoy Bay were very high during MIS 7 and 9, which is the span that covers our
MP data. These high uplift rates could lead to a higher probability of habitat destruction for
marine molluscs. This information will be included in the Discussion.
Lines 236-238 …… please ckeck the sentence, as from the wisker plot of fig. 4 I do not see
any difference from MP and LP or younger age stages.
Reply: The sentence was modified to ‘with only MP shells showing significant differences in
size with HOL shells (Supplementary Table 3).’ The analyses and results for Figure 4 were
double-checked and they are correct - Supplementary Table 3.
Discussion
Lines 245-246. Judging from figure 4B, Mulinia is still present alive in the investigated area.
So I suggest not to consider it extirpated or locally extinct...perhaps….. rare.
Reply: The reviewer has a valid point. The sentence was changed to: ‘while Mulinia is
nowadays very rare, and only consistently found alive in neighbouring bays..’ Now line 247.
This was also clarified in the text in line 233: ‘for Mulinia from a neighbouring bay, the mean
length’
Lines 248-249 this sentence is quite generic. Is there any detected environmental change
during the last few millennia? Beside Mulina was showed low abundances also during the
Middle Pleistocene. Any specific explanation for low abundance during MP?
Antropogenic impacts should be better delineated, farming Argopecten does have an impact
(or not) on the Mulina biotope? Finally, any widespread disease affected Mulina during the
present day? I suggest to add here a reference to the (sub)chapters where the authors deal
with the above mentioned questions.
Reply: The reviewer has a valid point regarding Mulinia in the MP. Our explanation is the
same as was offered above for size: ‘The uplift rates in Tongoy Bay were very high during
MIS 7 and 9, which is the span that covers our MP data. These high uplift rates could lead to
a higher probability of habitat destruction for marine molluscs.’
The reviewers’ suggestions were taken into consideration and the group of sentences now
reads: ‘There is an artificial increase in the relative abundance of Argopecten, while Mulinia
is nowadays rare, and only found living in neighbouring bays. The increase in Argopecten
abundance is likely a reflection of aquaculture practices, yet we are unaware of any
detrimental effects this practice could have had on Mulinia. The absence of this clam may be
due to natural environmental changes in the region, local changes in freshwater input to the
bay (see ‘Reconstructing the regional history of Mulinia’ in the Discussion below), and/or to
more recent anthropogenic impacts such as disease by parasites (see ‘Recent local
anthropogenic pressures on the benthic community’ in the Discussion below). Results
indicate that natural and anthropogenic stressors probably impacted the populations at
different times, with strong anthropogenic impacts being quite recent (less than 50 years).’
Lines 246-255.
Line 253.
I suggest to insert one or two sentences on the fact that this is not the scope of the manuscript,
as it would imply a set of paleoenvrionmental reconstructions performed to identify major
environmental drivers of faunal turnovers. Beside it would require a more refined sequence
stratigraphic framework of sampled fossil successions. As stratigraphic biases migh play a
strong overprint on macrobenthic records (e.g., diversity-->Scarponi and Kowalewski, 2007
Palaios, as for time averaging --> Scarponi et al. 2013- Geology)
Reply: We appreciate the suggestion and have incorporated it to the text that now reads as
follows: ‘Moreover, even if the exceeds the scope of the manuscript, it is worth emphasizing
that in order to reconstruct changes in the community over time a Conservation
Palaeobiology approach is fundamental. This would require doing more detailed
palaeoenvironmental reconstructions together with a refined stratigraphic framework .’
Lines 257-260.
Lines 276-307 I suggest to add a statement, concerning the low abundance of Mulinia during
Middle Pleistocene. Perhaps, evironmental settings of the MP sampled succession could
provide qualitative/quantitative insights on major environmental drivers of Mulinia
abundance.
Reply:The reviewers’ suggestion was followed and we included a sentence concerning the
low abundance of Mulinia in the MP: ‘There are however notable differences in abundance
and size for Mulinia between the MP and LP. This can be explained by changes in uplift rates
in Tongoy Bay during the MP, in particular MIS 7 and MIS 9 [45]. These high uplift rates
could have led to a higher probability of habitat destruction, that could have impacted
molluscan abundance and size. The species seems to have recovered in the Late Pleistocene.’
Line 277 see my previous comment on locally extinct and fig. 4
Reply: The sentence was modified to ‘Mulinia is locally very rare in Tongoy Bay and is only
consistently found alive..’. Now line 293 & 294.
Line 280 and/or Line 334 is recovery connected to human induced aquaculture and fishing
overexploitation during late ‘80? if so it should pertain to the modern live and dead
assemblages and not on the middle, late Pleistocene and Holocene.
Reply: Yes, the recovery is likely connected with controls to aquaculture and fishing
overexploitation. Mulinias’ abundance decreased long before that, possibly due to changes in
the Holocene. That’s why we suggest that natural and anthropogenic factors both played a
part but at different times. Given that the controls to aquaculture and overfishing are recent
we do not know for sure if there has been a real recovery or just a recent increase in
abundance.
Figure 4 in Fig. 4B Mulinia is reported alive in modern environments. However in the text,
Mulinia is reported as extirpated from Tongoy Bay. This could be confusing and should be
clarified. Are live collected Mulinia are from neighbouring bays (if so please specify it here)
or Mulina is not locally extinct but only extremely rare in Togon Bay?In the latter case, the
text should be modified accordingly.
Fig. 4 line 647-649 this sentence is not necessary here. I would erase as already stated in the
text.
Fig. 4 lines 449-450 please explain the meaning of the box plots. E.g., wat the top and bottom
of the box stand for, and what the thick horizontal line represents ....., wiskers ..... and dots
indicate ……
Reply: The reviewers’ suggestion has been incorporated in the text as indicated in previous
instances above. The sentence from Fig. 4 was deleted following the reviewers’ suggestion,
and the information on to how to interpret boxplots was also included to the Figure caption.
Now lines 670 & 671.
Reviewer 2
I only have two minor comments about the methods: 1) For the fossil samples collected -
were these lithified or unlithified samples? I am asking this because this will affect the
analyses in the paper when compared to unlithified live-dead community. I think there just
needs to be a clarifying statement about the nature of the fossil samples (sieved or bulk). 2)
For your bivalve counts did you account for 2 valves=1 individual? I am sure that the authors
did, but it would be good to have this protocol included in the methods so that readers know
that there is not inflation in the bivalve counts.
Reply: The reviewer makes two very useful comments that have been included in the text:
‘All the fossil samples correspond to bulk-collected unlithified samples comparable to the
unlithified Dead Assemblages and the live-collected samples’. Lines 101 & 102.
‘For bivalves the number of individuals was calculated dividing the total number of valves by
two’. Lines 110 & 111.
We hope to have addressed the reviewers' comments to your expectations, and hopefully you
will now find the manuscript suitable for publication.
