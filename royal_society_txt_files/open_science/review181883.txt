The present manuscript investigates the fatigue behaviour of natural rubber filled with three
different kinds of carbon black via oscillation amplitude sweep. Reasonable explanation and
assumptions corresponds to the structure evolution of CB filled NR during different fatigue stage
are proposed through appropriate characterization methods. This work gives new insight into the
process from integrity to crack nucleation of filled rubber materials under cyclic loading
conditions. The paper can be accepted for publication after minor revisions.
1. “For the unfilled polymer, the cross-linking density is larger than CB filled composites possibly
due to the adsorption of curatives by CB aggregates in filled system.” (P7) the authors are
suggested to supplement the data of swelling equilibrium experiment.
2. According to the analysis of authors, in the early stage of fatigue, disruption of filler network
and breakdown of cross-linking network contribute to the decrease of E’ , but why would the
glass transition frequency also decrease rapidly with low fatigue degree (Fig 6d)?

I am happy to recommend this paper for publication subject to minor revisions. The paper was
well written, made good use of graphics and was generally well researched. There are however a
few minor revisions I would like to see prior to publication:
a) You state that fatigue damage is mostly due to cavitation induced by the decohesion between
zinc oxides and rubber matrix.' The paper you cite (Le Cam) actually suggests 4 initiation
features; 2 resulting from the Carbon Black network, the third being oxides decohesion and the
fourth being inherent voids. I recommend that you adapt the text here to state as such. (Line 52,
Page 1)
b) How effectively can you judge 'visible cavities' particularly if they are 100um? It would be
helpful to provide an image of such cavities for the readers to judge. (Line 9, Page 3)
c) Your definitions for 'degree of fatigue', 'fatigue life' and 'fatigue time' are unclear. Please can
you rephrase them make it clearer. It would be useful to have an example to help the reader
understand your method. Could the degree of fatigue be shown graphically? (Line 11, Page 3)
d) Rather than base the fatigue life of the shortest life, would it not have been more appropriate to
use the average fatigue life? (Line 13, Page 3)
e) These are non common filler grades, i.e. N220 or N330 would be more common. Please
comment whether there is a specific reason these were chosen. (Line 17, Page 3)
f) You suggest that the high destruction of the filler network for N339 was due to its high
structural degree. Here I suggest that you refer the reader back to your DBPA results for these
elastomers. (Line 52, Page 4)
g) In Figure 2 the x-axis needs labelling. (Line 18, Page 5)
h) In Figure 2, if you are isolating the viscoelastic aspect of stress relaxation would it not be more
appropriate to plot time on a log scale? (Line 18, Page 5)
i) Units needed for the stress relaxation rates. (Line 21, Page 5)
j) I realise this may be difficult at this stage, but for the TEM image, Figure 5b, would it be
possible to identify the cyclic loading direction on the graph. The figure clearly shows the CB
agglomerates aligning but, as is, the alignment direction is unclear. This would help reinforce the
point you make at Lines 52-54. (Line 43, Page 6).
k) You mention that the signal decay rate is faster after sample fatigue; however, the data in
Figure 8 is awfully close. Arguably they are within experimental error of each other, which
cannot be judge from one test repeat. I suggest you caveat your statement with this point. (Line
36, Page 8)
l) Correct the power terms for the units such that they are superscript. (Line 5, Page 11)

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers comments concerning our man-
uscript entitled: Impact of Uniaxial Tensile Fatigue on the Evolution of Micro-
scopic and Mesoscopic Structure of Carbon Black Filled Natural Rubber (Man-
uscript ID: RSOS-181883)
The comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our
paper, as well as the important guiding significance to our researches. We have
studied comments carefully and have made correction which we hope meet with
approval. The revised portions are marked in red in the paper. The main correc-
tions in the paper and the responds to the reviewers’ comments are as following:
Responds to the reviewer’s comments: Reviewer 1:
1. Response to comment: “For the unfilled polymer, the cross-linking density is
larger than that of CB filled composites possibly due to the adsorption of cura-
tives by CB aggregates in filled system.” (P7) the authors are suggested to sup-
plement the data of swelling equilibrium experiment.
Response: Thank you for the nice suggestion. The swelling equilibrium experi-
ment is a good method to evaluate the cross-linking density. However, it includes
the effect of the chemical cross-linking of the matrix and filler-polymer interac-
tion for filled system. The contribution of the filler-polymer interaction will
makes the cross-linking density of the filled system higher. Therefore, we con-
sider to change the sentence as “ For the unfilled polymer, the chemical
cross-linking density of the matrix is larger than that for the CB filled composites
possibly due to the adsorption of curatives by CB aggregates in filled system”.
(Reference: Nonentropic Reinforcement in Elastomer Nanocomposites, DOI:
10.1021/acs.macromol.7b00698, page G)
2. Response to comment: According to the analysis of authors, in the early stage
of fatigue, disruption of filler network and breakdown of cross-linking network
contribute to the decrease of E’, but why would the glass transition frequency
also decrease rapidly with low fatigue degree (Fig 6d)?
Response: It is considered that the breakdown of cross-linking network domi-
nates the glass transition frequency, and the degree of disruption of the
cross-linking network is strong at low fatigue degree. Therefore, the glass transi-
tion frequency decreases rapidly with low fatigue degree.
3. Response to comment: The title of x axis is omitted in Fig 2.
Response: We are very sorry for our negligence. The title of x axis has been
added in the modified version.
4. Response to comment: The “G’” (P5, L3) should be “E’”.
Response: We are very sorry for our incorrect writing, and we have corrected it
in the modified version.
5. Response to comment: The symbols in Fig 6a should be depicted in forms that
can be differentiated more conveniently.
Response: We have made correction according to the nice comments. The sym-
bols in Fig 6a have been depicted in different forms.
Reviewer: 2
a) Response to comment: You state that fatigue damage is mostly due to cavita-
tion induced by the decohesion between zinc oxides and rubber matrix.' The pa-
per you cite (Le Cam) actually suggests 4 initiation features; 2 resulting from the
Carbon Black network, the third being oxides decohesion and the fourth being
inherent voids. I recommend that you adapt the text here to state as such. (Line
52, Page 1)
Response: Thank you for your precise correction. We adapt it in the modifica-
tion version according to the nice recommendation.
b) Response to comment: How effectively can you judge 'visible cavities' partic-
ularly if they are 100um? It would be helpful to provide an image of such cavi-
ties for the readers to judge. (Line 9, Page 3)
Response: We made the fatigue machine stopped and stretched the sample into
100% strain. In this case, it will be much easy to judge the ‘visible cavities’ (red
circle). The correlative statement will be included in the modified version and
the image will be included in the supporting information.
c) Response to comment: Your definitions for 'degree of fatigue', 'fatigue life' and
'fatigue time' are unclear. Please can you rephrase them make it clearer. It would
be useful to have an example to help the reader understand your method. Could
the degree of fatigue be shown graphically? (Line 11, Page 3)
Response: The “fatigue life”, which is marked as “L” in equation 1, refers to the
fatigue time corresponding to the visible "cavities" on the surface of the speci-
men by eyes. (Fig.1 in supporting information) The “fatigue time”, which is
marked as “t” in equation 1, can be used to set the time of experiment. The “de-
gree of fatigue”, which is marked as “d”, is defined as the ratio between the “fa-
tigue time” and “fatigue life”, that is, d=t/L.
d) Response to comment: Rather than base the fatigue life of the shortest life,
would it not have been more appropriate to use the average fatigue life? (Line 13,
Page 3)
Response: It is really true as Reviewer suggested that it is more appropriate to
use the average fatigue life. In fact, we used the average fatigue life for the ex-
periment. We have revised it in the modified version.
e) Response to comment: These are non common filler grades, i.e. N220 or N330
would be more common. Please comment whether there is a specific reason
these were chosen. (Line 17, Page 3)
Response: Yes, the N220 and N330 are very common in rubber industry. How-
ever, the N234, N326 and N339 are also used extensively in tire, conveyer belt
and other rubber products. Analytical characteristics of carbon black N234, N326
and N339 have been listed in Table 1. The difference between carbon black
N234 and carbon black 339 is the CTAB,but with the similar DBPA, i.e. the
particle size is obviously different. The difference between carbon black N326
and carbon black 339 is the DBPA, but with the similar CTAB, i.e. the degree of
structure is clearly different. In this work, we want to investigate the effect of
particle size and degree of structure of carbon black on the fatigue properties. In
this case, it is better to keep one parameter (“particle size” or “degree of struc-
ture” of carbon black) constantly and the other one (“degree of structure” or
“particle size” of carbon black) will be changed to make the result clear.
f) Response to comment: You suggest that the high destruction of the filler net-
work for N339 was due to its high structural degree. Here I suggest that you refer
the reader back to your DBPA results for these elastomers. (Line 52, Page 4)
Response: We agree with this comment. The sentence “Analytical characteris-
tics of the elastomers are listed in Table 1” has been inserted in the modified
version.
g) Response to comment: In Figure 2 the x-axis needs labelling. (Line 18, Page
5)
Response: We are very sorry for our negligence of the x-axis. It has been modi-
fied in the modified version.
h) Response to comment: In Figure 2, if you are isolating the viscoelastic aspect
of stress relaxation would it not be more appropriate to plot time on a log scale?
(Line 18, Page 5)
Response: Yes, it will be more appropriate to plot time on a log scale and we
have corrected it in the modified version.

i) Response to comment: Units needed for the stress relaxation rates. (Line 21,
Page 5)
Response: We are very sorry for our negligence of the units and it has been
added in the modified version.
j) Response to comment: I realize this may be difficult at this stage, but for the
TEM image, Figure 5b, would it be possible to identify the cyclic loading direc-
tion on the graph. The figure clearly shows the CB agglomerates aligning but, as
is, the alignment direction is unclear. This would help reinforce the point you
make at Lines 52-54. (Line 43, Page 6).
Response: Thank you very much for the good suggestion. In fact, the plane of
TEM image is vertical to the cyclic loading direction. We consider that the
cross-section of the sample will turns to be narrow and the contractility will in-
duce the CB agglomerates aligning.
k) Response to comment: You mention that the signal decay rate is faster after
sample fatigue; however, the data in Figure 8 is awfully close. Arguably they are
within experimental error of each other, which cannot be judge from one test
repeat. I suggest you caveat your statement with this point. (Line 36, Page 8)
Response: We will modify it in the modified version like this:“The signal decay
rate of the sample after fatigue is faster than that of the sample before fatigue,
although the difference between these two samples is not much enough. Howev-
er, the relative values are the same within the 5 repeats. In this case, it is possible
to indicate that the polymer chain segment is a bit more restricted after fatigue.”
l) Response to comment: Correct the power terms for the units such that they are
superscript. (Line 5, Page 11)
Response: We have made correction and corrected the power terms for the units
in Fig. 6 in the new version.
We appreciate for Editors/Reviewers’ warm work earnestly, and hope that the cor
rection will meet with approval.
Once again, thank you very much for your careful comments and positive sug-
gestions.
