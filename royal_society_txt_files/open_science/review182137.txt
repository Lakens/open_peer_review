The present manuscript reports biomimetic synthesis of nanostructured WO3·H2O particles. The
synthesis/characterization techniques are performed at a high technical standard, and discussion
given in the manuscript are basically sound. In this context, this manuscript is potentially
acceptable, according to the publication criteria of Royal Society Open Science. However, I think,
further discussions should be added to show clearly the back ground of the present study, and
give robustness to the conclusions.
I’d like to add following remarks to be further considered by the authors;
1) I wonder if the present manuscript is the first report on the biomimetic synthesis of WO3·H2O
(and WO3) or not. Otherwise, what’s a significant advance from the previous biomimetic
synthesis of WO3-based materials? The advance of the present work should be clearly discussed
in the introduction section; significant advance of scientific knowledge is a criteria of acceptance
by RSOS.
2) The authors describe their previous works on the synthesis of CeO2 and SnO in the
introduction section (the second paragraph in the introduction). The context somehow gives us
an impression that the present work had been routinely-done. I suggest to add some comments to
describe scientific challenges for the biomimetic synthesis of WO3, and how the present system is
different from previous ones.
3) The crystallization in the present system is highly sensitive to the pH of the solution. pH after
the reaction as well as before the reaction should be given to confirm robustness of the discussion;
precipitation of crystals is usually accompanied by the change of pH of reaction mixture.
4) What is the aging time employed for samples appeared in Figs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The authors
describes in the experimental section that they tested aging time 1-7 days. Which aging time was
chosen for the discussions in respective figures?
5) Reaction kinetics of the crystallization process should be discussed on at least one sample. I’m
wondering how the crystallization occurs as a function of reaction time. Is there any induction
period for the crystallization? How does the morphology develop with reaction time?
6) The weight ratio of gelatin/WO3 should be calculated from the TG data of the obtained
product. This information gives us an idea on what kind of composite is indeed obtained.
7) Fig4: “the flat face of the layered structure” is ambiguous. It should be marked in Fig.4.
8) It might be interesting to compare TEM images and diffractions before and after the
calcination. Is there any relevance of crystallographic orientation between them?

The authors report the new biomimetic synthesis of WO3·H2O particles, which can further be
converted to WO3 particles by heat treatment at higher temperature. The synthesis method and
discussion on the mechanisms of the particle formation are technically sound, and the
conclusions are supported by experimental data obtained from sufficient number of samples.
Therefore the manuscript would be publishable in Royal Society Open Science after addressing
minor issues shown below.
The inner structure of the particles should be analyzed. Are the size and shape of the pores, the
crystalline size and orientation the same on the surface and inside of the particles? Surface area,
pore volume, pore size distribution, true density, particle density, etc. are also importance to be
measured for detailed characterization.
In the Introduction section, the authors mentioned that WO3 has been used in various devices.
Thus, readers would be interested in what sort of advantages the newly prepared WO3 particles
have or which application field they can be practically used in.
Compared with the other published works on biomimetic synthesis, the method and findings in
the manuscript sound not quite new. Thus, a little more characterization or property
measurement of the obtained particles would further demonstrate importance of the work.

ur response to Reviewer 1
hank you for your careful reading and positive review.
feree 1’s original comment
he present manuscript reports biomimetic synthesis of nanostructured WO3·H2O particles. The
thesis/characterization techniques are performed at a high technical standard, and discussion
en in the manuscript are basically sound. In this context, this manuscript is potentially acceptable,
ording to the publication criteria of Royal Society Open Science. However, I think, further
cussions should be added to show clearly the back ground of the present study, and give
ustness to the conclusions.
’d like to add following remarks to be further considered by the authors;
feree 1’s Question 1:
wonder if the present manuscript is the first report on the biomimetic synthesis of WO3·H2O
d WO3) or not. Otherwise, what’s a significant advance from the previous biomimetic synthesis
WO3-based materials? The advance of the present work should be clearly discussed in the
oduction section; significant advance of scientific knowledge is a criteria of acceptance by
OS.
r response 1:
Recently, many types of biomimetic synthesis of inorganic materials have been suggested,
ere the factors incorporated from biomineralization vary from work to work. Many of the
mimetic works of functional metal oxide materials focus on the similarity in the “resultant
ostructure” between the products and the real biominerals, and the resultant device performance.
n the other hand, our groups have studied “new aqueous technique” mimicking
mineralization for nanostructural control of materials. We think that the key factors of
mineralization are (1) the interaction between inorganic crystals and biological polymers, and (2)
multistep synthetic procedure via metastable phases as the precursor materials, and have
gested new approaches containing the one or both factors for making nanostructures like
minerals. The “biomimetic synthetic route” would lead to the formation of “biomimetic
ostructure” which is the hierarchical structures consisting of oriented inorganic nanocrystallites.
n the present work, the biomimetic aqueous route with biological polymers has been suggested
preparing WO3 materials. The synthetic method with a biological polymer, gelatin, is a new and
inal concept for WO3-based materials. Moreover, the WO3 products of the present work had the
rarchical nanostructures like biominerals (the layered structure consisting of
stallographically-oriented nanorods).
We believe that these concept and results of the present work have a fully significant advance and
manuscript is worthy to be published in Royal Society Open Science.
In order to clarify the advance of the present work, in pp. 1, line 37, the introduction section has
n modified as follows;
Biomimetic structures have been widely made from nanoscale inorganic units and biological
ymers [11-13, 18-25]. Many works about biomimetic synthesis of functional metal oxide
erials mainly focused on the similarity in the resultant nanostructure between the products and
real biominerals, and the resultant device performance. On the other hand, we have focused
“biomimetic synthetic route”, and attempted to construct novel aqueous techniques for making
ostructured materials. We think that the key factors of biomineralization are (1) the interaction
ween inorganic crystals and biological polymers, and (2) the multistep synthetic procedure via
astable phases as the precursor materials, and have suggested new approaches containing the
or both factors for making hierarchical structures consisting of oriented nanocrystallites like
minerals. Cocoon-like CeCO3OH particles consisting of nanoscale crystallites were prepared
m aqueous solutions and gels containing CeCl3 and biological polymers such as gelatin and
r, by the addition of (NH4)2CO3 solutions. They were then thermally converted to CeO2 particles
h the same morphologies [26]. Spherical SnO particles consisting of radially-branched platy
ts were produced by aging Sn6O4(OH)4 in aqueous solutions containing gelatin at 60 °C [27].
nce, biomimetic aqueous routes are promising ways to fabricate nanostructured inorganic
erials.”
feree 1’s Question 2:
The authors describe their previous works on the synthesis of CeO2 and SnO in the introduction
tion (the second paragraph in the introduction). The context somehow gives us an impression
the present work had been routinely-done. I suggest to add some comments to describe
ntific challenges for the biomimetic synthesis of WO3, and how the present system is different
m previous ones.
r response 2:
We have previously reported several works about the biomimetic synthesis of inorganic
erials. As mentioned in the response 1, we think that the key factors of biomineralization are (1)
interaction between inorganic crystals and biological polymers, and (2) the multistep synthetic
cedure via metastable phases as the precursor materials. The suitable route for making a
mimetic nanostructure varies from one compound to another, and thus we have to found the
quate method depending on the target materials. Thus, our papers always contain a new insight,
thus are not routine works.
he present work mainly focused on the nanostructural control of precursor materials
O3·H2O) with biological polymers and the thermal conversion to metal oxide materials (WO3).
mentioned in the introduction section, we have reported the biomimetic synthesis of
ostructured CeO2 materials, which was done on the basis of a similar strategy. We achieved the
paration of nanostructured CeCO3OH particles with biological polymers (gelatin and agar) and
thermal conversion to CeO2, while the crystallographic orientation of inorganic units like
minerals were not observed in the CeO2 products. Thus, in the present work, we selected
3·H2O and WO3 for making hierarchical structures consisting of oriented inorganic
ocrystallites like biominerals. The topotactic transformation from WO3·H2O to WO3 crystals has
n reported, which would allow us to keep the crystallographic orientation of inorganic units after
thermal conversion to metal oxide.
In order to more clearly show the concept of the present work, in pp. 1, line 54, the introduction
tion has been modified as follows;
Here, nanostructured WO3·H2O particles were prepared as WO3 precursors from
4)10W12O41·5H2O aqueous solutions that contained gelatin; the WO3 particles were
sequently obtained by heating the precursors. As mentioned above, we have previously tried to
pare nanostructured CeO2 materials on the basis of a similar strategy [26]. In that work,
ostructured CeCO3OH particles were obtained with biological polymers and then thermally
verted to CeO2, while the crystallographic orientation of inorganic units like biominerals were
observed in the CeO2 products [26]. On the other hand, WO3·H2O were reported to
otactically transform to monoclinic WO3 crystals [33], which would allow us to keep the
stallographic orientation of inorganic units after the thermal conversion to metal oxide. We
ied the pH and the gelatin concentration to investigate the effects on size, shape, and crystal
se of the WO3 precursors and WO3 particles.”
feree 1’s Question 3:
The crystallization in the present system is highly sensitive to the pH of the solution. pH after the
ction as well as before the reaction should be given to confirm robustness of the discussion;
cipitation of crystals is usually accompanied by the change of pH of reaction mixture.
r response 3:
We appreciate the referee’s helpful suggestion. The precipitation of WO3·H2O under an acidic
dition seems to be as follows;
42- + 2H+ <U+2192> WO3·H2O
s reaction consumes H+ ions, resulting in the increase in the pH value.
About some conditions, we measured the pH value of the solutions before and after the reaction.
pH value is shown as follows;
Table. pH value of the solutions before and after the reaction
pH of [gelatin] / pH of solutions pH of solutions
solvents g L-1 before the reaction after the reaction
0.6 0 0.63 0.65
0.6 2.0 0.60 0.59
1.0 0 1.05 1.09
1.0 2.0 1.04 1.02
addition of gelatin didn’t provide a significant pH change, and the pH value almost unchanged
r the precipitation. In the present case, the [(NH4)10W12O41·5H2O] was very low (1.7 mM), and
s the pH change was deduced to be small during the reaction.
n pp. 3, line 6, the description on pH change has been added as follows;
he precipitation of WO3·H2O under an acidic condition seems to be as follows;
42- + 2H+ <U+2192> WO3·H2O (1)
s reaction consumes H+ ions, resulting in the increase in the pH value. On the other hand, in the
sent case, the pH value almost unchanged after the precipitation. Here, the
H4)10W12O41·5H2O] was very low (1.7 mM), and thus the pH change was deduced to be small
ing the reaction.”
feree 1’s Question 4 and 5:
What is the aging time employed for samples appeared in Figs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The authors
cribes in the experimental section that they tested aging time 1-7 days. Which aging time was
sen for the discussions in respective figures?
Reaction kinetics of the crystallization process should be discussed on at least one sample. I’m wondering
the crystallization occurs as a function of reaction time. Is there any induction period for the
tallization? How does the morphology develop with reaction time?
r response 4 and 5:
he aging times which employed for the samples appeared in Figures 1-7 corresponds to those
own in Table 1.
n this work, at first, we performed preliminary experiments to know the reaction time to obtain
ficient amounts of products. We changed the aging time between 1-7 days at all pH and [gelatin]
ditions, and knew the sufficient time that the increase in the sample yield stopped.
bout the experimental condition with Cge = 2.0 g L-1 at pH 1.0, we investigated the effect of the
ction time on the morphology and crystal phase of the WO3·H2O particles. No precipitation was
erved for 1-3 days, while yellowish precipitates appeared after 4 days. The diffraction peaks
ibuted to WO3·H2O were observed irrespective of the reaction times (4-7 days). The morphology
he 4-7 days WO3·H2O products changed with reaction time. The samples obtained on 4 days
the mixture of layered plates and spherical particles. The spherical particles disappeared with
reasing reaction times, and only layered plates were observed after 6 days.
he spherical particles found in the samples of 4-5 days were thought to be the composites of
gstate ions and gelatin. As described in the experimental section, in this work, the
H4)10W12O41 aqueous solutions immediately became cloudy by an addition of gelatin, which
ht to be attributed to the formation of the composites of tungstate ions and gelatin. The cloudy
pension became transparent again by stirring at 80 ºC, and then was used as the precursor
utions. In the case of the samples of 4-5 days, the precipitation of WO3·H2O didn’t complete, and
s unreacted tungstate ions remained in the solutions. The tungstate ions might precipitate as the
atin composite during cooling, forming the spherical particles.
hus, we set the reaction time at the sufficient one when the increase in the sample yield stopped
the spherical particles disappeared. The sufficient aging time differed depending on the
erimental conditions (pH and [gelatin]), which was described in Table 1. Thus, the aging time
ployed for samples in Figs 1-7 corresponds to those described in Table 1.
n order to more clearly show the meaning of “aging time”, in pp. 2, line 27, the description on
aging times and product yields has been modified as follows;
At first, we performed preliminary experiments to know the reaction time that the increase in the
ple yield stopped. Aqueous solutions of 1.7 mM [(NH4)10W12O41·5H2O] and 0–2.0 g L-1 gelatin
e) with HCl at pH 0.6–1.0 were aged at 60 °C for 1–7 days. Yellowish WO3 precursors were
cipitated by aging irrespective of Cge and pH. The aging times that the increase in the sample
d stopped, and precursor yields are listed in Table 1. The precipitation of the WO3 precursors
slower and the yield decreased with increasing pH, which indicated that nucleation was
pressed by the decreased acidity. Tungsten oxides precipitate as hydrous tungstic acid
WO4·nH2O) [35-36] and tungsten trioxide (WO3·nH2O) [33-34] under strongly acidic
ditions, and their solubility increases with pH [28-32] In the present case, the higher solubility
er more weakly acidic conditions caused a slower nucleation rate and thus a lower yield of WO3
cursors. Moreover, the addition of gelatin also inhibited the deposition of WO3 precursors
ause its amino groups might have coordinated with tungstate ions, leading to suppressed
leation. On the basis of these results, we employed the aging time described in Table 1 for a
ple preparation.”
nd, figure captions has been modified as follows;

H 1.0.
n pp. 5, line 24, the results and discussion about the effect of aging time on the morphology and
stal phase has been added as follows;
We investigated the effect of the aging time on the morphology and crystal phase of WO3
cursors. WO3 precursors were prepared by aging for 1-7 days from (NH4)10W12O41 solutions
h Cge = 2.0 g L-1 and HCl at pH 1.0. No precipitation was observed for 1-3 days, while the
cipitation appeared after 4 days. Figure 5 shows the XRD patterns of WO3 precursors prepared
aging for 4-7 days. The diffraction peaks attributed to WO3·H2O were observed irrespective of
aging times. Figure 6 shows the SEM images of the WO3 precursors. The precipitate obtained
4 days was the mixture of layered plates and spherical particles. The spherical particles
appeared with increasing aging times, and only layered plates were observed after 6 days. The
erical particles found in the precipitates of 4-5 days were thought to be the composites of
gstate ions and gelatin. As described in the experimental section, in this work, the
4)10W12O41 aqueous solutions immediately became cloudy by an addition of gelatin, which
ht to be attributed to the formation of the composites of tungstate ions and gelatin. The cloudy
pension became transparent again by stirring at 80 ºC, and then was used as the precursor
utions. In the case of the 4-5 days aging, the precipitation of WO3·H2O didn’t complete, and thus
eacted tungstate ions remained in the solutions. The tungstate ions might precipitate as the
atin composite during cooling, forming the spherical particles.”
nd, the XRD patterns and SEM images WO3 precursors prepared by aging for 4-7 days from
H4)10W12O41 solutions with Cge= 2.0 g L-1 and HCl at pH 1.0 has been added as Figures 5 and 6.

ure 6. SEM images of WO3 precursors prepared by aging for 4 (a) and 6 (b) days from
H4)10W12O41 solutions with Cge= 2.0 g L-1 and HCl at pH 1.0.
feree 1’s Question 6:
The weight ratio of gelatin/WO3 should be calculated from the TG data of the obtained product.
s information gives us an idea on what kind of composite is indeed obtained.
r response 6:
s mentioned in pp. 7, line 21, the weight loss attributed to the combustion of residual gelatin at
ºC was ca. 1 wt%. Moreover, we performed FT-IR analysis for the WO3·H2O sample, where no
orption peaks due to gelatin were not seen. Thus, only a little amount of gelatin was thought to
ain on the WO3·H2O products.
FT-IR spectra has been added as Figure 8 into the main text as follows;
ure 8. FT-IR spectra for WO3 precursors prepared from (NH4)10W12O41 solutions with Cge= 0
2.0 g L-1 and HCl at pH 1.0 (the aging time was as shown in Table 1).
nd, in pp. 7, line 21, the description on the FT-IR analysis has been added as follows;
In addition, a slight weight loss of 1 wt% was detected at 550 °C, which could be attributed to
bustion of residual gelatin. We also investigated the presence of residual gelatin on the WO3
cursors by FT-IR analysis. Figure 8 shows FT-IR spectra for the WO3 precursors (Cge = 0 and
g L-1, pH 1.0). No absorption peaks due to gelatin were not detected, which also indicates that
y a little amount of gelatin remained on the WO3·H2O products.”
feree 1’s Question 7:
ig4: “the flat face of the layered structure” is ambiguous. It should be marked in Fig.4.
r response 7:
n order to clearly show “the flat face of the layered structure”, Figures 4 and 10 was modified as
ows;
ure 4. SEM images of WO3 precursors prepared from (NH4)10W12O41 solutions with Cge=0.2 g
(a) and 1.5 g L-1 (b–d) and HCl at pH 1.0 (the aging time was as shown in Table 1).
ure 10. FE-SEM (a–b) and FE-TEM (c–d) images of heat-treated WO3 products from WO3
cursors prepared by aging for 7 days from (NH4)10W12O41 solutions with Cge=1.5 g L-1 and HCl
H 1.0.
feree 1’s Question 8:
t might be interesting to compare TEM images and diffractions before and after the calcination.
here any relevance of crystallographic orientation between them?
r response 8:
hank you for a good suggestion. As the referee 1 mentioned, the comparison of TEM images
ween the samples before and after calcination is definitely an interesting issue.
n fact, we attempted to evaluate the crystallographic orientation of the WO3·H2O precursor
erials, and to discuss the relevance to the resultant WO3 materials. However, the WO3·H2O
stals were not stable toward an electron beam, and deformed during the TEM analysis. Thus, we
e not yet obtained the adequate information about the crystallographic orientation.
n the other hand, as discussed in the XRD analysis part, the flat face of WO3·H2O layered
es was found to be (010) plane of the WO3·H2O crystal. Moreover, the electron diffraction
ern of WO3 (Fig. 7d) shows that the flat face of heat-treated WO3 layers is (001) plane of
noclinic WO3. WO3·H2O were reported to topotactically transform to monoclinic WO3 crystals
]. These suggest the topotactic transformation of [010]-oriented WO3·H2O crystals to
1]-oriented WO3.
In order to clarify the crystallographic relevance between the samples before and after
cination, in pp. 8, line 56, the discussion part about the TEM analysis has been modified as
ows;
Figure 10 shows FE-SEM and FE-TEM images of the heat-treated WO3 products (Cge = 1.5
-1, pH 1.0). As shown in figure 10a, the layered structure of the WO3 precursors remained after
rmal conversion to WO3. In addition, orthogonally-crossed nanorods 50 nm in width were
erved in the WO3 layers (figures 10b,c). Regular diffraction spots were observed in the selected
a electron diffraction pattern of the WO3 (figure 10d). The diffraction spots indicated that the
-like units were oriented in the same crystallographic direction, and the flat face of heat-treated
3 layers is (001) plane of monoclinic WO3. WO3·H2O were reported to topotactically transform
monoclinic WO3 crystals [33]. As discussed in the XRD measurement of WO3 precursors, the flat
e of the WO3·H2O layered structures was the (010) plane of WO3·H2O crystals. These suggest the
otactic transformation of [010]-oriented WO3·H2O layered plates to [001]-oriented WO3.”

ur response to Reviewer 2
hank you for your careful reading and positive review.
feree 2’s original comment
he authors report the new biomimetic synthesis of WO3·H2O particles, which can further be
verted to WO3 particles by heat treatment at higher temperature. The synthesis method and
cussion on the mechanisms of the particle formation are technically sound, and the conclusions
supported by experimental data obtained from sufficient number of samples. Therefore the
nuscript would be publishable in Royal Society Open Science after addressing minor issues
wn below.
feree 2’s Question 1:
he inner structure of the particles should be analyzed. Are the size and shape of the pores, the
stalline size and orientation the same on the surface and inside of the particles? Surface area,
e volume, pore size distribution, true density, particle density, etc. are also importance to be
asured for detailed characterization.
r response 1:
hank you for a good suggestion. As the referee 1 mentioned, the detailed analysis of the porous
ctures of the WO3 products is very important.
We attempted to observe the inside structure of the products. However, the unit crystallites were
sely packed in the layered architectures, and thus the inner structure was hard to be evaluated by
M and TEM analysis. The detailed analysis is our important remaining issue.
lthough the direct observation of the pore and crystallite sizes was not achieved, we evaluated
BET surface area of the WO3 products by N2 adsorption method. The surface area of the layered
cture obtained by an addition of gelatin (Cge = 2.0 g L-1) was 5.02 m2 g-1, which was larger than
of the random aggregates of Cge = 0 g L-1 (2.31 m2 g-1). These shows that the synthesis route
h biological polymer is effective for preparing nanostructured materials.
n pp. 9 line 5 the description on the surface area of the WO3 products has been added as follows;
“We evaluated the BET surface area of the WO3 products by N2 adsorption method. The
face area of the layered structure obtained by an addition of gelatin (Cge = 1.5 g-L-1, pH 1.0)
5.02 m2 g-1, which was larger than that of the random aggregates of Cge = 0 g-L-1, pH 1.0 (2.31
g-1). ”
feree 2’s Question 2:
In the Introduction section, the authors mentioned that WO3 has been used in various devices.
s, readers would be interested in what sort of advantages the newly prepared WO3 particles have
which application field they can be practically used in.
r response 2:
s mentioned in the response 1, the addition of gelatin resulted in the increase in the surface area
WO3 particle materials. Such WO3 materials with a larger surface area are thought to be suitable
the photoelectrodes and gas sensors. Since photoelectrochemical reactions and gas sensing occur
the surface of the electrode materials, a larger surface area of the nanostructured electrodes
uld result in better device performance.
In order to clarify the advantage of the WO3 products, in pp. 9, line 3, the discussion part has
n modified as follows;
“These results suggested that the WO3 layered structures prepared with gelatin have highly
ered nanostructures consisting of oriented inorganic nanoscale units like biominerals such as
res, sea urchin spines, and eggshells [9-17]. We evaluated the BET surface area of the WO3
ducts by N2 adsorption method. The surface area of the layered structure obtained by an
ition of gelatin (Cge = 1.5 g-L-1, pH 1.0) was 5.02 m2 g-1, which was larger than that of the
dom aggregates of Cge = 0 g-L-1, pH 1.0 (2.31 m2 g-1). The hierarchical nanostructures are
ught to be suitable for photoelectrode and gas sensor materials.”
ow, we are trying to prepare WO3 film materials on the basis of the present work, and to
luate the device performance. We would report the results in the near future.
feree 2’s Question 3:
Compared with the other published works on biomimetic synthesis, the method and findings in
manuscript sound not quite new. Thus, a little more characterization or property measurement of
obtained particles would further demonstrate importance of the work.
r response 3:
s the referee 2 mentioned, recently, many types of biomimetic synthesis of inorganic materials
e been suggested. Many of them focus on the similarity in the “resultant nanostructure” between
products and the real biominerals. On the other hand, our groups have studied new “synthetic
te” mimicking biomineralization. We think that the key factors of biomineralization are (1) the
raction between inorganic crystals and biological polymers, and (2) the multistep synthetic
cedure via metastable phases as the precursor materials, and have suggested new approaches
taining the one or both factors for making nanostructures like biominerals. The “biomimetic
thetic route” would lead to the formation of “biomimetic nanostructure” which is the
rarchical structures consisting of oriented inorganic nanocrystallites.
n the present work, the biomimetic aqueous route with biological polymers has been suggested
preparing WO3 materials. The synthetic method with a biological polymer, gelatin, is a new and
inal concept for WO3-based materials. Moreover, the WO3 products of the present work had the
rarchical nanostructures like biominerals (the layered structure consisting of
stallographically-oriented nanorods).
We believe that these concept and results of the present work have a fully significant advance and
manuscript is worthy to be published in Royal Society Open Science.
In order to clarify the advance of the present work, in pp. 1, line 37, the introduction section has
n modified as follows;
Biomimetic structures have been widely made from nanoscale inorganic units and biological
ymers [11-13, 18-25]. Many works about biomimetic synthesis of functional metal oxide
erials mainly focused on the similarity in the resultant nanostructure between the products and
real biominerals, and the resultant device performance. On the other hand, we have focused
“biomimetic synthetic route”, and attempted to construct novel aqueous techniques for making
ostructured materials. We think that the key factors of biomineralization are (1) the interaction
ween inorganic crystals and biological polymers, and (2) the multistep synthetic procedure via
astable phases as the precursor materials, and have suggested new approaches containing the
or both factors for making hierarchical structures consisting of oriented nanocrystallites like
minerals. Cocoon-like CeCO3OH particles consisting of nanoscale crystallites were prepared
m aqueous solutions and gels containing CeCl3 and biological polymers such as gelatin and
r, by the addition of (NH4)2CO3 solutions. They were then thermally converted to CeO2 particles
h the same morphologies [26]. Spherical SnO particles consisting of radially-branched platy
ts were produced by aging Sn6O4(OH)4 in aqueous solutions containing gelatin at 60 °C [27].
nce, biomimetic aqueous routes are promising ways to fabricate nanostructured inorganic
erials.”
