I have reviewed the paper, “Developmental plasticity of the stress response in female but not
male guppies” and believe it will make an excellent contribution to Royal Society Open Access.
The authors assessed stress responses in guppies by analyzing cortisol release and found
interesting effects of sex, predation risk, and the social environment. The overall paper is well
written and clear, the methods and results are well done, and the introduction and discussion are
well balanced and well explained. I have no critical comments. I only have two extremely minor
editorial comments.
Line 191: ‘…following [40], and consumed…’ sounds awkward to me. Maybe just remove
‘following’.

This manuscript examines the cortisol response of male and female guppies reared under high
and low density and with or without predator cues. As adults, free cortisol was measured by
collecting the water individual fish were housed in. Fish were measured twice; the first
measurement was one hour after the were placed in a beaker next to two other beakers. These
individuals were then separated into two groups and measured one hour later, with one group
being placed in the same conditions as before, or in a social isolation treatment that prevented
them from seeing other individuals.
The authors find differences between males and females (males maintain similar cortisol
3
excretion rates, while females decrease cortisol). They also find, females reared at high density
with predator cues maintained similar cortisol release rates between the two measurements.
The question of whether stressful conditions experienced early in life (e.g. developing under high
or low density, and/or with and without predators) result in adaptive stress responses later in
life is an important question and of general interest. Furthermore, investigating how multiple
stressors act either independently or synergistically to shape stress responses is rarely tested.
Despite these strengths, I had several concerns regarding the experimental design, statistical
analysis, and interpretation of the results. I expand on these concerns below, and make
suggestions for how the manuscript could be improved.
Experimental Design
1) If the goal of the study was to test if early life exposure to stressors results in adaptive adult
responses, a stronger study design would have compared how the adult guppies responded to
acute predator or density cues. The study does not do this, and instead tests if differences in the
developmental environment result in differences in cortisol release rates of adults. This is a valid
question that has implications for adult stress responses to predators/density, but not the same.
Thus, I would recommend revising the introduction to better reflect what the study does test.
2) The measurement of excreted free cortisol into water has obvious methodological benefits in
such small fish. Such measurements are strengthened when they are coupled with measurements
of cortisol in the plasma or whole body of the test subjects. Unfortunately, that was not done in
this study, so all comparisons are relative measures across individuals and treatments. This point
should be made more clearly in the manuscript.
3) This concern aside, measurements of cortisol are very sensitive to the conditions they are
collected under, and the amount of time individuals acclimate to the test environment. For this
reason, I was surprised to see that both cortisol samples were taken on the same day and only one
hour apart. This experimental design is problematic. Specifically, despite claims that habituation
is tested for, an examination of the literature reveals that it takes guppies up to 3 days for cortisol
excretion rates to level off (see Fischer et al. 2013 Hormones and Behavior). Thus, given the short
duration of time in the beaker and the short time between the first and second cortisol
measurement, I’m not sure how much can be interpreted from the comparison between the social
isolation and standard treatment. I would like to see the discussion revised, such that more
attention is given to the issue of habituation time, and how they might influence the results.
Statistical Analysis
1) If I understood the experimental design correctly, it appears the same individual was
measured twice, once under the standard conditions, and a second time one hour later in either
the same conditions or in the social isolation treatment. Individual should therefore be included
in the statistical model as a random effect. Including individual as a random effect in the model,
could strengthen the overall results (e.g. despite individual variation in baseline cortisol,
individuals show the same general response), or could make the results all non-significant (e.g. a
few individuals are driving the pattern).
2) While it is common to convert the dependent variable into ng/g/h prior to analyses, this
removes a degree of freedom that should otherwise be included in the statistical model. Gary
Packard and Thomas Boardman have written numerous papers on this problem. The solution is
simply to redo the analyses on the untransformed values and include body mass in the model.
Alternatively, the same model can be used, but the p-values need to be adjusted to reflect an
additional degree of freedom.
4
3) The use of ratios when comparing the cortisol response (e.g. Fig. 2) should be avoided. The
problem here is that the ratio obscures whether the denominator or numerator is changing. I
would recommend simply taking the average of the two measurements.
Interpretation
It is difficult for me to draw any strong conclusions on the results. I would need to see how the
results change following the reanalysis. Nevertheless, as per my comments above, I think the
interpretations and conclusions should be constrained to how the juvenile developmental
conditions influence cortisol levels as adults – rather than trying to draw conclusions regarding
the stress response of adults to different treatments.

erimental Design
f the goal of the study was to test if early life exposure to stressors results in adaptive adult
ponses, a stronger study design would have compared how the adult guppies responded to
te predator or density cues. The study does not do this, and instead tests if differences in the
elopmental environment result in differences in cortisol release rates of adults. This is a valid
stion that has implications for adult stress responses to predators/density, but not the same.
s, I would recommend revising the introduction to better reflect what the study does test.
agree with reviewer 2 that our experiment does not test whether adult reactions are adaptive
ponses to the particular stressors experienced in early life, but instead investigates whether
ly life experience can shape a general hormonal mechanism that controls the responses to
ny stressors later in life. We believe this has broad implications that extend beyond our study
cies or the particular stressors we manipulated. To clarify our aims, we revised several parts
he abstract and introduction:
bstract:. “We investigated how sex and early-life experience influence hormonal stress
ponses…”
nes 14-16 “ As responses to stressors are mediated by shared endocrine mechanisms, early
exposure to particular stressors likely impacts responses to multiple stressors later in life
ne 44: “We investigated the role of developmental experience and sex on the hormonal stress
ponse of adult Trinidadian guppies”
ne 48: “that early life conditions would shape the hormonal stress responses” instead of
at early life conditions would shape stress responses”
ne 61-62: “Cortisol was used as a measure of the physiological mechanisms that govern the
ss response”
The measurement of excreted free cortisol into water has obvious methodological benefits in
h small fish. Such measurements are strengthened when they are coupled with measurements
ortisol in the plasma or whole body of the test subjects. Unfortunately, that was not done in
study, so all comparisons are relative measures across individuals and treatments. This point
uld be made more clearly in the manuscript.
iewer 2 is correct that our measure of cortisol is relative between individuals and treatments,
it is extremely difficult with such small organisms to test cortisol in plasma. There is
dence in fish, that water-borne cortisol correlates with circulating levels (see papers 32-33 in
bibliography). To clarify further that our measure is relative, we added the following
tence in line 116-117: “but the most conservative way to interpret the hormone
centrations is as a relative value among individuals and conditions.”, and the word ‘relative’
ine 114.
This concern aside, measurements of cortisol are very sensitive to the conditions they are
ected under, and the amount of time individuals acclimate to the test environment. For this
son, I was surprised to see that both cortisol samples were taken on the same day and only one
r apart. This experimental design is problematic. Specifically, despite claims that habituation
ested for, an examination of the literature reveals that it takes guppies up to 3 days for cortisol
retion rates to level off (see Fischer et al. 2013 Hormones and Behavior). Thus, given the
rt duration of time in the beaker and the short time between the first and second cortisol
asurement, I’m not sure how much can be interpreted from the comparison between the social
ation and standard treatment. I would like to see the discussion revised, such that more
ntion is given to the issue of habituation time, and how they might influence the results.
agree that our fish are probably not fully habituated to our conditions during the second
ection period, and thus that the levels do not represent baseline cortisol levels. Our
estigation was rather about how fast fish from each sex and each developmental condition
ituated to the stressor. We clarified this throughout the manuscript by specifically writing
eed of habituation’ instead of ‘habituation’ (lines 62, 161, 166, 238, 247). We also added the
owing sentence:
ne 315-320 : In our experiment, we measured water-borne cortisol levels twice but only an
r apart, thus our second measure does not represent a fully-habituated baseline level of
tisol release (noted in the Fischer et al. 2014 article suggested by the reviewer - cited in the
nuscript). Instead, the change between the two collections provides a measure of the speed of
ituation, and thus it is possible that this habituation process is masking the effect of the social
tment on collection 2.
tistical Analysis
f I understood the experimental design correctly, it appears the same individual was measured
ce, once under the standard conditions, and a second time one hour later in either the same
ditions or in the social isolation treatment. Individual should therefore be included in the
istical model as a random effect. Including individual as a random effect in the model, could
ngthen the overall results (e.g. despite individual variation in baseline cortisol, individuals
w the same general response), or could make the results all non-significant (e.g. a few
ividuals are driving the pattern).
iewer 2 is correct about the design of the experiment. We did not include individual ID as we
y used the second measure of cortisol in our analysis of the change in cortisol released in
er, i.e. our ‘ratio’ measure. This means that there was no repeated measure in the original
del, and each individual had only one ‘line’ of response variable.
suggested, it is possible to investigate the change in cortisol release using a repeated
asure, in which each individual would have values for cortisol release in each collection
iod. We ran this model (see output and model details below, Table R1). In this model, the
llection period’ factor is our measure of change. We obtained results that matched our
ginal results: Collection (noted as phase in the table below) was significant (i.e., there is a
nificant change between cortisol release in both phases), we also found the sex effect we

While it is common to convert the dependent variable into ng/g/h prior to analyses, this
oves a degree of freedom that should otherwise be included in the statistical model. Gary
kard and Thomas Boardman have written numerous papers on this problem. The solution is
ply to redo the analyses on the untransformed values and include body mass in the model.
ernatively, the same model can be used, but the p-values need to be adjusted to reflect an
itional degree of freedom.
understand the worry of reviewer 2 and are aware of the Packard and Boardman papers on
topic (e.g. Physiological Zoology 1988; Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology 1999).
s worry concerns only our model on the cortisol release during phase 1, as our other model
s ratio as the response variable and thus the value remains unchanged regardless of the
ling by mass (see response above and below for why we kept the ratio analysis). We
nalyzed our data using the unscaled cortisol measure and adding the centered mass value as
ovariate. We find the same results. We therefore replaced the original model with this one in
manuscript. We replaced the values in the results section and in table 1. However, given the
espread use of rates per gram of body mass, we also report these results in Figure 1 and the
plementary materials (table S2) and we indicate this on line 205-208 and in the legend of
ure 1 in lines 362-363.
The use of ratios when comparing the cortisol response (e.g. Fig. 2) should be avoided. The
blem here is that the ratio obscures whether the denominator or numerator is changing. I
uld recommend simply taking the average of the two measurements.
r question is specifically about the relative change in cortisol between the two collection
iods, as such, taking the average of both trials would not be appropriate. The average would
e us an idea of the individual tendencies, rather than change over time. We use the ratio as we
nted to examine the change in the amount of cortisol released. Using ratios also allows us to
ove confounding factors such as individual body mass. Since our results were robust to the
lysis of cortisol release when including the random effect of individual (repeated measures
ead of ratio, see reply to statistical analysis comment 1), we think that using a ratio is
ropriate in this instance. Using ratio instead of both measures with a repeated measure
kes it easier to represent graphically. Moreover, it reduces the number of factors and
plexity of interpretation of the model output, without changing our results.
rpretation
difficult for me to draw any strong conclusions on the results. I would need to see how the
ults change following the reanalysis. Nevertheless, as per my comments above, I think the
rpretations and conclusions should be constrained to how the juvenile developmental
ditions influence cortisol levels as adults – rather than trying to draw conclusions regarding
stress response of adults to different treatments
hope that seeing that our results are robust to the suggested changes to the analysis allows
iewer 2 to be more confident in our results and interpretations. We have nonetheless made
eral alterations to the discussion and introduction in order to better convey that our
eriment tested cortisol as a proxy for the physiological stress responses rather than the
ponses to the experienced stressors themselves (introduction lines 14-16, 48, discussion lines
-243, 250, 322). We also note this in the introduction in lines 61-62.
