The study on the response of sand bubbler crabs to sand-suction dynamics is highly interesting,
well conducted and worth of publication. Still, the interpretation of the results and text layout
need a thorough revision, as indicated below. The “detection of sediment suction state” was not
analysed, but simply inferred from the observation of behaviour and literature. “Migration” was
not observed, but the orientation to suction gradient was tested in laboratory experiments, while
zonation and zonal recovery after typhon events were analysed in the field. “Habitat formation”
is a general concept: here burrowing/burrow development/competition for burrows were
studied. Throughout the text, the terms “environment” and “habitat” are used with different
meanings. I suggest to use “beach zone”, defined by specific features, including sediment suction;
“habitat”, when referring to the zone where the SBC live; “burrow”, the constructions by the
SBCs.
Title – it is misleading, as no detection (of what?) nor migration were observed. I suggest a new
title that would better reflect the study: “Suction-induced habitat selection, orientation and
burrowing in sand bubbler crabs”.
Abstract – Please, add the scientific name of the studied species, which is a crustacean decapod.
In general the term “invertebrates” should be avoided because it refers to very different animal
groups. Please, mention the environment under study, i.e. sand flats, and geographically locate
the study area; specify that both laboratory experiments and field observation were carried out,;
lines 7, 11: change “environments” with “beach zones”;
line 8: change “form habitats” with “develop burrows”; explain what “normal times” and “times
of events” are;
line 13: it is not clear;
line 14: Please, change “detection, migration and habitat formation” with “Suction-induced
habitat selection, orientation and burrowing in sand bubbler crabs”, as suggested above;
line 18: please change the sentence, as an environment can not “give rise”;
line 19: please define “critical suction environment”;
lines 20-21: Delete the sentence, as this is a naïve statement, which would need a forum
discussion, as the drivers of human habitat selection behaviour are much more complicated than
crabs’ ones. Sediment suction/soil characteristic as drivers for human constructions are beyond
the aims of the study!
Keywords: change “migration” with “orientation”
Introduction
Lines 27-28 – This is a naïve statement that ignores the huge literature on orientation to cues of
different nature, gradients and directional stimuli, on humans and animals including
invertebrates; I suggest to delete the whole sentence and start with the keyword “Capillarity”.
Lines 31-32 – Please delete “from insects to humans” (no direct relationships, ignoring marine
and interstitial animals…); quote a review paper on the subject, which may also include plants,
which are biological objects highly influenced by capillarity;
Line 34 – “magical power” is not a scientific concept and should be avoided;
Line 39 – change “surficial” with “surface”;
Line 48 – please, add here the scientific name of the species studied; define “critical suction”;
Line 53-54 – see above
Methods
Line 73- change “habitats” with “burrows”;
Lines 77, 92-93 – please geographically locate the study sites;
Line 82 – How many crabs were tested? At what time of day? What was the treatment before and
after the experiments (captivity time, feeding, handling, were individuals re-used?);
Line 84 – change with “Experiments were carried out to see how burrows are formed by sand
3
bubbler crabs”;
Line 91 – “equal to 10mm”: this is not possible! Kindly write the error or write “around 10mm”;
Line 94 – “density surveys”: add here the sampling method and design used, which is specified
at lines 166-169;
Line 97 – “in different seasons”: kindly specify the differences between seasons for international
readers; “tensiometers”, please specify the characteristics of the instruments used;
Lines 110-111 – change “process of migration” with “displacement”; change “creation” with
“excavation”;
Results and discussion – The results, discussion and conclusions should be clearly separated. I
suggest to add subtitles instead of repetitions of the methods.
Lines 115-118 – replace with a subtitle, referring to figure S1, e.g., “Laboratory experiments using
the two dimensional flume”;
Lines 120-122 – “Since…suction”: please remove to the Discussion, as this was not tested, but was
inferred from the literature;
Lines 131-132 – “These results…environments” should be removed to the Conclusions;
Lines 133-135 – replace “A question…suction” with a subtitle like “Suction-induced burrow
excavation in the field”; Replace “One such…figure 3a” with “The density of individuals versus
sediment suction was recorded in the intertidal sandflat Isumi”.
Lines 138 – Change “habitat formation” as explained above;
Line 142 – Change “corresponds” with “corresponded”;
Lines 145-150 – This long sentence is not clear;
Line 154 – Change “habitat” with “burrow”;
Line 156 – Change “habitat formation” with “burrowing activity”;
Iine 159 – “more suitable optimum” sounds odd; you may simply write “abobe/below G.W.L.
OP”;
Lines 161-162 – Please change “formation of habitats” with “excavation of burrows”;
“manifested” is a transitive verb and should be “manifested itself”, better “was observed”;
Lines 164-165 – The statement belongs to the Conclusions;
Lines 166-169 – The sentence is a repetition of the Methods and should be replaced by a subtitle,
like “Suction-induced burrowing behaviour following typhon events”;
Line 178 - “manifested” is a transitive verb and should be “manifested itself”, better “was
observed”;
Lines 179-181 - The statement belongs to the Conclusions;
Line 181 – Add here a subtitle like “Crab competition for burrows”;
Line 187 – change “numbered” with “The number of thieves was 132”;
Line 190 – Change “created” with “excavated”;
Lines 193-194 – “These findings… society”, see comment for lines 20-21; in any case the statement
belongs to the Discussion;
Line 195 – Start here the “Conclusions” section, taking into account the above comments. Please,
note that the analysis of burrow excavation and defence is not new; what is new is the orientation
with respect to a suction gradient, i.e., a geophysical gradient.

The findings of this paper show that the sand bubbler crab (SBC) utilizes suction to detect and
migrate to suitable environments at different times. These results also show a suction-induced
detection, migration and habitat formation by SBC. The authors state that this is a new form of
environmental detection and migration by animals. The capillary suction responds to changes in
groundwater levels driven by climate change. These results may also affect conservation
strategies.
General comments:
1. English needs review. For example, ‘A series of experiments was performed…’ Line 115.
Change "was" by "were". Review the entire paper for additional edits.
2. Use the acronym SBC in the text as appropriate. There are several sections where the words
“sand bubbler crab” could be substituted with SBC. Lines 72, 74, 82, 84, etc.
3. Use past tense to describe aims, methods, and results. For example: "The present study aims to
explore...". Change it by "The present study explored the potential of the SBC…" Line 53.
Major comments:
Abstract:
1. What do the authors mean by “better living conditions”? Line 20
Results and Discussions:
1. What is a “suitable suction environment”? Line 132
2. Please explain the logic for the following statement: “a distinct habitat may be formed”. Line
154
3. Please explain the statement in line 193-194 “these findings indicate…, as in human society”.
Are the authors comparing the behavior of SBC with human behavior? If so, what variables of
human behavior were compared with SBC behavior?
4. How exactly do the authors suggest that their findings will “broaden the intersection between
biology, physics and engineering”?
The findings of this paper are very interesting but could be strengthened by avoiding
assumptions rather than the results provided for the experiments and field observations.

The revised version of the paper has addressed the issues highlighted in my previous review.
Rapid publication is reccommended.
Still, the following very minor changes would improve the paper:
line 19, "suitable suction environment cause repeated battles", please change with "repeated
battles were observed in suitable suction environment";
lines 97-98, the observation period is long and the dates should be reported in the paper; the four
seasons are mentioned in figure 3 only and are not four seasons in each site; so "different seasons"
would be better;
line 102, please change "created" with a "excavated";
line 117, please change "respond" with "responded";
line 126, please change "movement" with "movements"; "but instead" is pleonastic: please change
the expression by using "instead" or "but" only;
lines 160-161: the seasons of the observations were not the same for all sites;
Figure captions at lines 281, 282: pleas echange the word "creating" with "excavating";

day. In all experiments, the air temperature, the water temperature, and the salinity of the water and pore
were kept essentially constant at 20 to 21 <U+F0B0>C, 19 to 20 <U+F0B0>C, and 27 psu, respectively. Prior to the
ents, SBCs were maintained in the laboratory under aerated fresh seawater in the intertidal sediments for
e month to ensure that any endogenous physiological rhythms were abolished. We did not re-use
uals used for each case. After the experiments, we measured their carapace widths and wet weights. We
ded the corresponding descriptions in the Methods section.

ents by Reviewer #2 and the authors’ responses:
ent: The findings of this paper show that the sand bubbler crab (SBC) utilizes suction to detect and
to suitable environments at different times. These results also show a suction-induced detection,
on and habitat formation by SBC. The authors state that this is a new form of environmental detection
gration by animals. The capillary suction responds to changes in groundwater levels driven by climate
These results may also affect conservation strategies.
se: We sincerely appreciate your support for our study. We have revised our manuscript by addressing
rifying all of the comments provided as described below. Please note that all of the revised parts are
hted in red in the revised manuscript attached herewith.
ent: English needs review. For example, ‘A series of experiments was performed…’ Line 115. Change
y "were". Review the entire paper for additional edits.
se: We have revised the manuscript based on the editing by the English language editor. We have also
the sentence as suggested.
ent: Use the acronym SBC in the text as appropriate. There are several sections where the words “sand
crab” could be substituted with SBC. Lines 72, 74, 82, 84, etc.
se: We have used the acronym SBC as appropriate consistently in the revised manuscript.
ent: Use past tense to describe aims, methods, and results. For example: "The present study aims to
...". Change it by "The present study explored the potential of the SBC…" Line 53.
se: We have used the past tense as suggested.
ent: Abstract:
do the authors mean by “better living conditions”? Line 20
se: We have omitted the corresponding sentence in the Abstract.
ent: Results and Discussions:
is a “suitable suction environment”? Line 132
se: We have omitted the corresponding sentence here. Please note that the definition is described in lines
f the Introduction of the revised manuscript.
ent: Please explain the logic for the following statement: “a distinct habitat may be formed”. Line 154
se: In order to make the logic clear, we have revised the corresponding descriptions in lines 149-158 of
sed manuscript. Please also refer to the prior statemens in lines 132-134 of the revised manuscript.
ent: 3. Please explain the statement in line 193-194 “these findings indicate…, as in human society”. Are
ors comparing the behavior of SBC with human behavior? If so, what variables of human behavior were
ed with SBC behavior?
se: We have omitted that statement in the revised manuscript.
ent: How exactly do the authors suggest that their findings will “broaden the intersection between
, physics and engineering”?
se: We have revised the sentence such that “this new form of habitat selection by animals will broaden
rsection between ecology and geophysics”. Please note that the ecology here refers to habitat selection
geophysics does suction-induced geophysical processes in our study.
ent: The findings of this paper are very interesting but could be strengthened by avoiding assumptions
han the results provided for the experiments and field observations.
se: We sincerely appreciate your support for our study. We have revised the whole manuscript on the
the results obtained in the present study.
