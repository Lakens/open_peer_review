This manuscript reports the study on high selectivity and sensitivity fluorescent sensing cortisol
based on a competitive binding assay using a fluorescent competitor with molecularly imprinted
polymers. The approach that developed in this article is interesting, fluorescent chemosensor was
designed based on the using of a cortisol motif template molecule (TM1) which consists of a
polymerizable moiety attached at the 3-carbonyl group of cortisol via an oxime linkage and an
adamantane carboxylate moiety. The results show that this proposed approach can be
successfully applied to detect cortisol in real samples, and a feasibility study in detection of
cortisol in saliva samples. The work will be suitable for publication after addressing the following
point:
1. The manuscript is essentially well written, but the language still needs some revising and
polishing. Such as, in page 15 lines 21-22, the word of “the” should be removed.
2. The authors proposed the homogeneous cavities with two binding sites for cortisol, but
there is no data to prove the formation of oxime bond. Please provide the FT-IR data to confirm it
was formed.
3. The ref 32 is the same as ref 47, please check.
4. Authors need to include important references of the novel molecularly imprinted
polymers with superior sensing performance. (i.e. New J. Chem. 2016, 40, 1649; Monatsh Chem
2015,146, 485; J. Applied Polymer Sciences, 2014, 131, 40491; RSC Adv., 2013, 3, 25396)

This is a well crafted paper from an established group in the MIP field. the experiments
conducted are logical and well described in the text and at each point where this reviewer

thought that additional experiments should have been performed they were next described in the
text. That is not to say that additional discussion / work is not warranted.
In many aspects this paper is comprehensive in its own right to be published as is, but this
reviewer feels that an already strong body of would could be further enhanced with the inclusion
of:
NMR data to validate the assertion that the adamantine moiety does indeed bind within the
cyclodextrin moiety.
The inclusion of data on the cortisol concentration in human saliva based on an accredited
approach - how does the MIP approach compare with the current best practice?
The paper would also benefit from the inclusion of a detailed list of abbreviations as at times it
took multiple readings to determine what was actually being discussed.
While the selectivity data shown in graphical format is impressive and clearly details the key
points of this work, researchers in the MIP field are used to examination of selectivity through
impact factors etc.

Editors and the Royal Society of Chemistry, I am pleased to inform you that your manuscript will
be accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science subject to minor revision in accordance
with the referee suggestions. Please find the reviewers' comments at the end of this email.
The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days (i.e. by the 02-Jul-2017). I note that some
additional characterisation data has been requested, which you may need additional time to
collect, so if you do not think you will be able to meet this date please let me know as soon as
possible.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your

account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Best wishes,
On behalf of the Subject Editor Dr Anthony Stace and the Associate Editor Professor Claire
Carmalt.

Appendix A
Response to reviewers
Reviewer 1
Q1-1. The manuscript is essentially well written, but the language still needs some revising and
polishing. Such as, in page 15 lines 21-22, the word of “the” should be removed.
A1-1 Page 12, Line 16
We have proofread the whole manuscript and edited the sentences at page13, line 16 to 20.
Q1-2. The authors proposed the homogeneous cavities with two binding sites for cortisol, but there is no
data to prove the formation of oxime bond. Please provide the FT-IR data to confirm it was formed.
A1-2 Figure 2
Unfortunately, any FI-IR data were not obtained due to the nm-sized thickness of the MIP, however,
because MIP bearing the dual interaction sites (ß-CD and aminooxy group) showed a greater affinity for
cortisol the reference polymer RP-ß-CD bearing single interaction site (ß-CD), the aminooxy group in
MIP can interact with cortisol.
Q1-3. The ref 32 is the same as ref 47, please check.
A1-3. The reference number was incorrect, and is has been corrected and re-numbered.
Q1-4. Authors need to include important references of the novel molecularly imprinted polymers with
superior sensing performance. (i.e. New J. Chem. 2016, 40, 1649; Monatsh Chem 2015,146, 485; J.
Applied Polymer Sciences, 2014, 131, 40491; RSC Adv., 2013, 3, 25396)
A1-4. The reviewer’s suggested references have been cited in main text.
Reviewer 2
Q2-1. NMR data to validate the assertion that the adamantine moiety does indeed bind within the
cyclodextrin moiety.
A2-1. Page 6, Lines 9 and Figure S1 in Supporting Information
We have conducted the additional experiments on the interaction between TM1 and ß-CD, and added the
following sentence in the main text at page 6, lines 9 to11, and Figure S1 in Supporting Information
, “The interaction between ß-CD and the adamantane group of TM1 was confirmed by 1H-NMR (Fig. S1),
while no interaction was observed between ß-CD and the styryl group of TM1.”
Q2-2. The inclusion of data on the cortisol concentration in human saliva based on an accredited
approach - how does the MIP approach compare with the current best practice?
A2-2. Page 13, Lines 9
We have added the following phrase to the main text at page 13, lines 9 to 10, “where the detectability
is comparable to that of commercially available ELISA [63] and radioimmuneassay [64]”.
Q2-3. The paper would also benefit from the inclusion of a detailed list of abbreviations as at times it
took multiple readings to determine what was actually being discussed.
A2-3. Page 17, Lines 12
The abbreviation list has been added in the main text at page 17, lines 12 to page 18, line 11.
Q2-4. While the selectivity data shown in graphical format is impressive and clearly details the key
points of this work, researchers in the MIP field are used to examination of selectivity through impact
factors etc.
A2-4. Page 12, Lines 1
We have added the key figures of the selectivity factors in the main text at page 12, line 1 to line 8.
