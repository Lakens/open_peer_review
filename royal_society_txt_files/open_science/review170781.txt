Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
This is a nicely written paper that highlights an interesting aspect of the understudied
biodiversity of New Guinea. I like the combination of a formal species description with the
hypothesis-testing regarding ecomorphological adaptations to karst habitat in the context of an
understudied lizard radiation.
While I hence support the idea and approach behind this paper, and definitely find the data
publishable, there are several instances where I have the impression that the methodology and
conclusions are too poorly explained to be easily accessible for readers unfamiliar with the body
of literature on this specific taxon or region, making it sometimes difficult to assess how strongly
the data actually support the conclusions. This may of course be due to me not being a gecko
specialist, but in that case I’m sure the authors will have it easy making their case convincing.
A major flaw of the publication in its current form is that, “Royal Society Open Science” being an
online-only journal, ZooBank registration is required for publication of a species description: see
http://iczn.org/content/electronic-publication-made-available-amendment-code and references
therein. This must be addressed before this proposed new species can be published.
More detailed comments are provided below. I hope the authors find my suggestions useful.
Introduction:
L. 73-74: in which respect is Cyrtodactylus the most diverse gecko genus? Genetic diversity,
species number…?
L. 98: something wrong here: “in the west and… [?]”
M&M:
L. 129: could the authors please explain the choice of marker? I have no problem with it per se,
but would like to see a justification for readers unfamiliar with this taxon.
L. 131: so Cyrtodactylus capreoloides was collected sympatrically with the currently newly
described species? Hence it partly occurs also in karstic habitat, then, but also elsewhere? Has it
been tested whether similar ecomorphological adaptations exist in this species?
L. 137-141: the methodology could use a bit more details here to become reproducible: settings for
the alignment algorithm, model used, number of bootstrap replicates…? Regarding the
Melanesian radiation, what kind of taxon coverage was included in the dataset (about 50% across
the entire genus, is mentioned later on)?
L. 142-145: also here, the methodology could be better explained. Which four genes? The reader
shouldn’t have to go searching in the supplementary data to find this out. Are sequences of all
four genes also available for the new species of Cyrtodactylus, and if yes, why isn’t it explained
above how these were amplified? Upon looking at the appendix, I actually have the impression
that only one marker is available for the new species (and for its close relatives, like C.
capreoloides, C. medioclivus and C. boreoclivus). Such missing data can be a problem when
building “supertrees” (e.g. Simmons, 2014, Mol. Phylogenet. Evol.). Could the authors comment
on this, do they expect an influence of this on the tree reconstruction and dating based on the
concatenated dataset?
L. 145-148: why assume that the GTR+G model is most suitable for all partitions? Why assume
that the nuclear data can be treated as a single partition?
L. 190-192: how did you define “similar-sized” (how did you choose the specified size window?)
3
and “very large” etc.? Of course, one always makes a certain qualitative choice when deciding
which species to include in an analysis, but since you are explicitly testing some morphological
hypothesis I feel that the selection of comparative data should be better justified.
Results:
L. 218-219 and Fig. 1: How do the authors delineate this “Australo-Papuan” radiation – I don’t
see it indicated in the figure or figure legend? Also, what do the authors call strongly supported?
Based on the caption of Fig. 1, I’d guess the authors use a cut-off of PP 0.9 for the Bayesian
analysis and 70% for the maximum likelihood one – is that such a “strong” support? By the way,
why is the 70% bootstrap support called “significant” – that reminds me of a statistical test? And
how does this correspond to the authors later on calling a support of 1.0/81% “moderate” (L. 220-
221) and 0.88/60% “low” (L. 227)?
L. 219: what do the authors call “phylogenetically very distant”? Given that we’re looking at a
cladogram, and in the absence of genetic distances provided anywhere else, and of a clear
delineation of what is considered to be inside and outside of this Australo-Papuan radiation, this
seems a quite relative expression to me.
L. 223: typographical error: “Crytodactylus”
L. 225-226: if these two species are only clustering with a low support and their genetic
divergence is quite substantial, couldn’t there just be an issue with missing taxa here?
Discussion:
I like how this well-written and rich discussion brings a lot of the mentioned results into
perspective, and how it links morphological adaptations to their potential function. I was
wondering whether the authors could also discuss the colour pattern of the new species, given
they mention potential colour pattern adaptation in “cave” species (L. 81-82)?
L. 542-543: something wrong with the construction of this sentence
L. 549: it is not entirely clear to me what you mean by the number of specialists being
underestimated. Do you mean that a lot of species are known that occur in (or are even confined
to) karst habitat, but of which the functional specialisation/adaptation has not been studied yet?

This is a very good paper and augments the work of other authors exploring gekkonid
ecomorphology. My only very minor criticism is the inconsistent and ambiguous rhetoric found
in a few places of the manuscript which I have marked on the .pdf. I have made several small
editorial changes to the ms and I have made a number of comments that the authors and the
editors should consider. But nothing major. This ms is in good shape and after a few minor
adjustments should be ready for publication. (Appendix A)

Comments to the Author:
Reviewer 1 states ethical concerns, noting that the authors did not mention how the freshly
collected animals were sacrificed, and specifically asks about the use of anesthetics. Furthermore,
a Zoobank registration may be required before publication of the new species. I ask the authors to
look into this. Additional remarks listed in comments to authors should be taken into account.
Reviewer 2 added remarks to the pdf file of the manuscript, which include suggestions regarding
statistical analyses, data presentation and interpretation.

The revision addresses all suggestions and comments that were made by the reviewers. I am
happy to suggest that their manuscript for acceptance. I noticed a few typos which I list below.
Line numbers refer to the submitted “track changes” version of the manuscript.
L31: comma after “majority”
L37: remove dash (-) between rock and habitat
L157: “checked for missense mutations and correct reading frames by eye” – but you probably
used software to translate the DNA sequences into amino acid sequences; perhaps just remove
the “by eye”?
l220: add slash to and/or
l244: change “phylogenetically detached” to “phylogenetically distinct”
l245: “mid-Miocene OF earlier splits” should probably be OR?
L314: replace the dot after “publication” with a colon (or vice versa in L316 after “combination”)
L 381: change “seperated” to “separated”
L393: remove “4”
L549: include “the” between “widen” and “centre”
L558: add “to” after “adapted”; in what sense is “specific” used here – as “particularly”? If used
as attribute to microhabitat (rather than adverb to rocky), it should be followed by a comma.
L869: Avoid “significant” in connection with bootstrap values; it will actually be sufficient to say
“ML bootstrap support values =70% are indicated by black circles subtending each node; ...”

6 28 Exposed limestone karst landscapes, especially in the tropics, are often home to
7
8 29 distinctive and specialised biotas. Amongst vertebrates, a particularly large number of
9
10 30 new karst-associated lizard taxa have been described, but for the vast majority of
11 31 these evidence of specific adaptions to karst is lacking. A number of studies, however,
12
13 32 have provided evidence of consistent morphological trends in lizards that utilise
14
15 33 complex, three-dimensional, saxicoline habitats such as those that typify karst areas.
16 34 Here we combine morphological and genetic data to test whether a newly discovered
17
18 35 gecko from an extremely rugged karst area in New Guinea shows morphological
19
20 36 trends matching these observed in these complex rock-habitat lizards. Consistent with
21 37 predictions, the new species’ head is flatter and narrower than similar sized relatives,
22
23 38 and it has proportionally larger eyes and longer limbs. These trends indicate this taxon
24
25 39 represents only the second documented instance of karst specialisation in a New
26 40 Guinean vertebrate, and suggest a set of morphological traits to test for similar
27
28 41 specialised ecological associations in the many Cyrtodactylus taxa known only from
29
30 42 karst in south-east Asia.

3 50 1. Introduction
4
5 51
6 52 Large areas of exposed limestone karst in tropical regions present spectacular
7
8 53 landscapes, and are home to unique, endemic and putatively specialised local biotas in
9
10 54 Madagascar [1], Southeast Asia [2], and Australia [3,4]. Lizards often show a
11 55 particularly close association with karst landforms, including numerous taxa that have
12
13 56 only been described recently [5–9]. Two broad, and by no means mutually exclusive
14
15 57 hypotheses can be advanced to explain this association. First, refugial evolutionary
16 58 dynamics, such as persistence through climatic change in microrefugia, was the driver
17
18 59 of localised distributions [4]. Or second, adaptive processes led formerly more
19
20 60 generalist lineages to become ecological specialists, restricted to the topographically
21 61 complex and often nutrient-poor habitats provided by karst [2,10].
22
23 62 Understanding patterns of morphological differentiation is one element of
24
25 63 teasing apart the relative roles of these two processes. Morphological studies have
26 64 suggested a suite of specialisations occur in many lizards that use complex, three-
27
28 65 dimensional rock structures, including, but not exclusive to karst [11]. These include
29
30 66 relatively long limbs, a more gracile body, and often a flatter head [11–13]. Other
31 67 studies have also suggested a tendency for rock-dwelling lizards to have
32
33 68 proportionally larger eyes [14], but this has not been tested systematically. In contrast,
34
35 69 if taxa endemic to karst show little evidence of morphological differentiation, and are
36 70 allopatric isolates separated from relatives by climatically unsuitable regions, it
37
38 71 suggests that karst endemism may be more strongly linked to refugial than adaptive
39
40 72 processes.
41 73 The bent-toed geckos (Gekkonidae: Cyrtodactylus) are the most diverse genus
42
43 74 of geckos, occurring across India, Indochina, Southeast Asia and Australia [15]. Over
44
45 75 fifty species from Indochina, Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo appear to be restricted
46 76 to isolated karst regions, surrounded by unsuitable habitat for Cyrtodactylus or forest
47
48 77 areas occupied by other congeners [16–19]. Despite this diversity and probable
49
50 78 ecological specialization, there has been relatively little work on patterns of
51 79 ecomorphological evolution in Cyrtodactylus. Some recent work, however, that
52
53 80 compared some ‘cave’ taxa (not exclusive to limestone) to more generalised relatives
54
55 81 found them to have a gracile build, longer limbs and a dorsal colour pattern consisting
56 82 of well-defined, narrow transverse bands [15,20].

3 83 Although most Cyrtodactylus diversity is concentrated in Asia, New Guinea,
4
5 84 northeastern Australia, and the surrounding islands of western Melanesia are also
6 85 home to a monophyletic radiation of around 30 species, notable for the apparently
7
8 86 parallel evolution of giant species [21]. While five Australian taxa within this
9
10 87 radiation seem to be closely associated with saxicoline habitats [17], karst associated
11 88 Cyrtodactylus have not been reported from New Guinea. This is despite the presence
12
13 89 of large areas of exposed limestone karst landforms [22,23]. Amongst other taxa, two
14
15 90 wide, but patchily, distributed bird and mammal species may be linked with New
16 91 Guinea karst [24,25], and recent surveys note a distinctive plant fauna (characterised
17
18 92 by the absence of some usually common taxa, some specialist forms and some
19
20 93 elevational depression) [26]. However, compared to nearby regions in South-East
21 94 Asia, there has been little investigation into patterns of biotic endemism and
22
23 95 specialisation in the New Guinea karsts.
24
25 96 The Southern Fold Mountains are the largest tract of karst in Melanesia,
26 97 extending along the southern edge of the Central Cordillera of New Guinea from Lake
27
28 98 Kutubu in the east to the Star Mountains in the west and [23]. Rainfall in this region is
29
30 99 extremely high (up to 8 m per year) [27]. Consequently, limestone is both highly
31 100 dissected and masked by vegetation [26], making the area difficult to access and thus
32
33 101 poorly known. PMO recently surveyed the herpetofaunal biodiversity of an extremely
34
35 102 rugged area of limestone in these ranges. During this survey, a novel and distinctive,
36 103 slender-bodied, medium sized (snout-vent length [SVL] 97 mm) new species of
37
38 104 Cyrtodactylus was collected. This species was abundant on both low vegetation and
39
40 105 karst structures, but has not been detected at sites near the type locality, which lack
41 106 exposed karst. Here we test if, relative to similar sized congeners, this species shows
42
43 107 evidence of the morphological specialisations typical of lizards associated with
44
45 108 complex, three-dimensional microhabitats – specifically long limbs, a flattened head
46 109 or disproportionately large eyes [11,12,14]. We also present a formal scientific
47
48 110 description of the new species.

3 116 Genetic samples (Appendix 1) and comparative material (Appendix 2) utilised in this
4
5 117 study are primarily stored at the following institutions: Australian Museum (AMS) –
6 118 Sydney; Museum Victoria (NMV) – Melbourne; South Australian
7
8 119 Museum/Australian Biological Tissues Collections (SAMA/ABTC) – Adelaide;
9
10 120 Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) – Harvard University, Cambridge; and
11 121 Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense (MZB) – Bogor. New specimens were collected by
12
13 122 hand at night while spotlighting between 19 April and 8 May 2013, preserved in
14
15 123 formalin, stored in ethanol, and subsequently lodged at Museum Victoria, the South
16 124 Australian Museum and the Papua New Guinea National Museum. Additional
17
18 125 comparative data for taxonomic descriptions were taken from published literature
19
20 126 [28–33] while most genetic data was also taken from recent publications [15,19,21].
21 127
22
23 128 2.2. Genetics
24
25 129 New sequence data from the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) was amplified
26 130 for four samples of the new species (SJR13150, 14640, 14709, 14743), in addition to
27
28 131 two samples of Cyrtodactylus capreoloides collected sympatrically (SJR 14746,
29
30 132 PMO19). Laboratory protocols largely followed Sistrom et al. (2009) with ND2 and
31 133 partial flanking tRNAs amplified using the primers M112F (5’-
32
33 134 AAGCTTTCGGGGCCCATACC-3’) and M1123R (5’-
34
35 135 GCTTAATTAAAGTGTYTGAGTTGC –3’) designed in the flanking Methionine and
36 136 Alanine tRNAs.
37
38 137 To initially place the putative new species within the Melanesian radiation we
39
40 138 analysed 987 bp of ND2 data aligned using the MUSCLE algorithm [35] in Geneious
41 139 v. 6.0.5 [36], and subsequently checked by eye. Phylogenetic trees were estimated
42
43 140 using standard maximum Likelihood (RAxML v.7.2.8) [37] analyses implemented on
44
45 141 the CIPRES web portal version 3.1 for online phylogenetic analysis.
46 142 Subsequently we used BEAST v.1.8.0 [38] to visualize the evolution of karst-
47
48 143 associated taxa across the radiation of Cyrtodactylus. We aligned genetic data from
49
50 144 the new taxon with a four gene dataset of Cyrtodactylus sequences synthesized from
51 145 published literature (Appendix 1) [15,21,28]. We used a three-partition strategy
52
53 146 following previous analyses of Melanesian Cyrtodactylus [21] (mitochondrial first
54
55 147 and second codons; mitochondrial thirds; and nuclear genes) with all partitions given
56 148 the GTR+G model. Topology and timeframes of divergence were estimated using the
57
58 149 uncorrelated lognormal model, birth-death speciation prior for 20 million generations,

3 150 sampling every 20,000 with the first 20% of trees discarded as burnin. Dating
4
5 151 calibrations followed those used elsewhere [21] with the addition of a broad normally
6 152 distributed prior at the base of sampled Cyrtodactylus (mean 32, S.D 5.0), derived
7
8 153 from an analysis of multi-locus nuclear data containing the majority of recognised
9
10 154 gecko genera and major lineages [4,39]. Habitat was coded as a simple binary state
11 155 (karst vs. not karst) and transition patterns were estimated using a simple all rates
12
13 156 equal model.
14
15 157
16 158 2.3. Morphology
17
18 159 The following morphometric measurements were taken with digital calipers to the
19
20 160 nearest 0.1 mm, with bilateral measures recorded from the left side of the body:
21 161 snout-vent length (SVL), tail length (from the posterior edge of the vent to the tip of
22
23 162 the tail (TL), total length of original portion of tail (OT), trunk length from posterior
24
25 163 edge of axilla to anterior edge of groin with limbs held at right angles (TrK),
26 164 maximum head width (HW), maximum head height (HH), head length from tip of
27
28 165 snout to anterior margin of ear opening (HL), distance from posterior edge of naris to
29
30 166 anterior corner of eye (EN) (used as a proxy for snout-length), transverse diameter of
31 167 eye (EYE), internarial distance (IN), transverse diameter of ear (EAR), forearm length
32
33 168 from base of palm to outer edge of elbow flexed at 90 degrees (FA), and hindlimb
34
35 169 length from base of heel to outer edge of knee flexed at 90 degrees (HDL).
36 170 For taxonomic comparisons the following meristic counts were also taken: left
37
38 171 and right enlarged supralabials (SUPR), to both the midpoint of the eye and to the
39
40 172 rictus; left and right infralabials to rictus (INFR); rows of enlarged dorsal tubercles
41 173 between the lateral folds (not including the lateral fold) at the midpoint of body
42
43 174 (DTR); ventral scale rows in a transverse series between ventral folds at midpoint of
44
45 175 the body (VENT); the number of subdigital lamellae (LAM), including both the
46 176 narrow (distal to the inflection of the digit; not including the ungual sheath) and wide
47
48 177 lamellae (proximal to the inflection of the joint) under the first and fourth digits of the
49
50 178 left manus and pes; precloacal (PREPOR) and femoral pores (FEMPOR) where
51 179 present (males only); postcloacal tubercles/spurs (PCTUB); and number of dark
52
53 180 brown, semi-distinct dorsal bands that cross the midline between limb insertions
54
55 181 (DB).

4
5 185 All statistical analyses were performed in R [40]. To test for potential morphological
6 186 correlates of living on karst, we used size-corrected mensural data for the new taxon,
7
8 187 compared against a suite of six, similarly-sized (max SVL 82 to 109 mm) Melanesian
9
10 188 Cyrtodactylus species (including all possible closest relatives: see results). Field
11 189 observations suggest most of these taxa are arboreal and occur widely away from
12
13 190 karst [28,33,41]. We focused on similar-sized species to reduce the potential for
14
15 191 generalised non-allometric growth trajectories to confound analyses. In particular,
16 192 many other Papuan Cyrtodactylus are very large geckos [21], raising the possibility
17
18 193 that processes such as peramorphosis could confound analyses of relative body
19
20 194 proportions [42].
21 195 All variables were log transformed. Juvenile and highly contorted specimens
22
23 196 were excluded from statistical analyses. Body, head and limb measurements were
24
25 197 corrected for body size by regressing against principle component 1 from an initial
26 198 Principle Components Analysis (PCA), in order to account for possible non-
27
28 199 allometric growth [43]. An initial PCA of the size-corrected body and head length
29
30 200 data was used to determine population-level distinctiveness in multivariate space (via
31 201 boxplots). We also visualised patterns of morphological variation across taxa in
32
33 202 phylomorphospace [44] based on species means for size-corrected traits and a reduced
34
35 203 ML phylogeny for the seven focal taxa.
36 204 To initially visualise patterns of univariate variation across species, we used
37
38 205 simple boxplots of the size-corrected morphological data. Because a number of our
39
40 206 focal taxa are only known from a handful of specimens (<10), we used non-
41 207 parametric approaches to test for significant variation in traits. First we used a non-
42
43 208 parametric MANOVA (adonis function in R package vegan [45]) to test for
44
45 209 differentiation across taxa based on a distance matrix calculated across 10,000
46 210 permutations. We then used the Krustal-Wallis Rank Sum test (Krustal.test function)
47
48 211 to compare morphological differentiation in traits across species pairs post hoc (with
49
50 212 the significance value set to P=0.05).

3 218 Phylogenetic analyses place the novel taxon within a strongly supported radiation of
4
5 219 Australo-Papuan Cyrtodactylus and phylogenetically very distant from all other
6 220 sampled Cyrtodactylus from karst areas (figure 1A–B). Based on moderate statistical
7
8 221 support (ML bootstrap 81%, Bayesian Posterior probability 1.0), it is part of a
9
10 222 recently identified clade of medium-sized, forest-dwelling species found in the
11 223 mountains/hills of central and northern New Guinea (Crytodactylus capreoloides,
12
13 224 Cyrtodactylus boreoclivus and Cyrtodactylus medioclivus) [28]. Phylogenetic
14
15 225 analyses suggested the new species is most closely allied to – but deeply divergent
16 226 from – the more widespread and partially sympatric taxon, C. capreoloides, although
17
18 227 this relationship was associated with low support (ML bootstrap 60%, PP 0.88).
19
20 228 Based on our sampling of just under half of the recognised species of
21 229 Cyrtodactylus (109 taxa or candidate taxa) at least 10 independent transitions into
22
23 230 karst microhabitats were inferred across New Guinea, Borneo, Peninsula Malaysia
24
25 231 and Indochina. Ancestral states estimation indicated that the new species provides the
26 232 first evidence of a shift into this habitat in Melanesia. No transitions out of karst, and
27
28 233 just one potential example of speciation within karst, were inferred.
29
30 234 The new species is estimated to have diverged from its putative sister lineage
31 235 Cyrtodactylus capreoloides around the late Miocene (mean age estimates in millions
32
33 236 of years ago 6.7, highest posterior distribution 5.1-8.2). Estimated divergence times of
34
35 237 other karst lineages varied widely, ranging from mid-Miocene to Pliocene (15–1
36 238 millions years ago), however as sampling in many parts of the range was very sparse
37
38 239 and many potential sister lineages are missing, older divergence dates in particular
39
40 240 should be treated with caution and are likely to be overestimates.
41 241
42
43 242 3.2. Morphology
44
45 243
46 244 Multivariate analyses of size-corrected data separated the novel species from all other
47
48 245 taxa sampled on PC axis 1, with no overlap (figure 2A). All morphological characters
49
50 246 except trunk length (TL) were strongly loaded onto PC axis 1. Phylomorphospace
51 247 plots also indicated that the new taxon was distinct from all the other medium-sized
52
53 248 Cyrtodactylus in our sample from New Guinea along PC axis 1, including the three
54
55 249 most closely related species C. boreoclivus, C. capreoloides and C. medioclivus
56 250 (figure 2B).

3 251 Visualisation of univariate data indicated that the new species had a
4
5 252 proportionately shallower and narrower head than all other sampled taxa, with very
6 253 little overlap of values. Mean relative forelimb and hindlimb length, and orbital width
7
8 254 were also the highest amongst sampled taxa, although the distribution of these values
9
10 255 overlapped more considerably (figure 3).
11 256 Non-paramatric MANOVA detected highly significant differences between
12
13 257 taxa (P<0.005). Subsequent non-paramatric ANOVAs detected significant differences
14
15 258 between taxa in all variables apart from Trunk Length (TL). Of the 20 pairwise
16 259 comparisons that significantly differed (with significance value set at 0.05), 18
17
18 260 involved the new limestone species. Relative orbital width showed the strongest
19
20 261 pattern, and was significantly wider in the new species than four of the six sampled
21 262 taxa, including all three closest relatives. The new species also had a significantly
22
23 263 shallower head than three other taxa (including two close relatives), and a narrower
24
25 264 head than four other taxa (including two close relatives). While mean forelimb and
26 265 hindlimb length was longer in the new species, in our statistical tests this did not
27
28 266 differ significantly from most other species. Likewise, while head length and snout
29
30 267 length showed some evidence of differentiation in univariate boxplots, most
31 268 comparisons with other taxa were not statistically significant.
32
33 269 In overall appearance, the new species appeared much more gracile than the
34
35 270 related and sympatric Cyrtodactylus capreoloides (figure 4).

39
40 273
41 274 The combination of genetic and morphological data confirm that these samples
42
43 275 represent a novel taxon that is genetically divergent and morphologically distinctive
44
45 276 from all other Cyrtodactylus, and that occurs in sympatry with its potential sister
46 277 taxon Cyrtodactylus capreoloides. We here describe it as a new species.

31 301 Cyrtodactylus tanim n. sp. can be distinguished from all other Melanesian and
32
33 302 (Wallacean) Cyrtodactylus by the following unique combination of characters:
34
35 303 moderate size (SVL to 96.7 mm) and very slender, with a relatively narrow head
36 304 (HW/SVL 0.17–0.19), mid dorsal tubercles in 14–16 rows at midpoint of body, lateral
37
38 305 fold without enlarged tubercles, subcaudal scales not transversely widened, pores in a
39
40 306 tripartite series, precloacal pores obvious and of moderate number (15–17), femoral
41 307 pores minute and numerous (31–30 per limb, 66–76 total), and dorsal colour pattern
42
43 308 on torso consisting of 6–9 semi-distinctly defined, alternating dark-brown bands or

20 328 surrounding scales, on temporal and occipital (and posterior nuchal) regions. Enlarged
21 329 infralabials slightly to much wider than high, 14 to either side, bordered by rows of
22
23 330 slightly enlarged scales that grade into small granular gular scales. Mental wider than

17
18 394 Dorsal color pattern always consists of variably defined, contrasting transverse
19
20 395 bands of dark to chocolate brown against an off-white to cream to light brown ground
21 396 color (figure 6). Dark bands fairly well defined, particularly along their posterior
22
23 397 borders; roughly equivalent width to or slightly narrower than the intervening lighter
24
25 398 bands, both of which are less than half the width of the trunk. Occasionally spots
26 399 invade the lighter bands. Some individuals with lighter background coloration near
27
28 400 the temples/occiput and light band along the supralabials. Venters cream to light
29
30 401 brown, often punctuated with lighter colored spots. Tails ventral surfaces proceed
31 402 from variably spotted at the dorsal end to uniformly dark brown, before gradually
32
33 403 lightening at the tip.

6 420 Cyrtodactylus tanim n. sp. differs from similar sized (max adult SVL ~ 80–
7
8 421 110 mm) but distantly related Melanesian species as follows: from C. aaroni and C.
9
10 422 mimikanus by the absence of enlarged subcaudals (vs. present), dorsal pattern of
11 423 moderately wide jagged dark brown dorsal bands (vs. very wide chocolate brown
12
13 424 bands separated by thin light stripes), and higher total number of pores in males (>80
14
15 425 vs. <80) (Rösler et al. 2007); from C. arcanus by the absence of enlarged subcaudals
16 426 (vs. present) and longer legs (HDL/SVL <0.17 vs. >0.18; Table 2); from C. biordinis
17
18 427 (Solomon Islands) by its higher number of dark transverse bands (6–8 vs. 3–4), more
19
20 428 numerous dark brown blotches on the head and neck (vs. two thick dark brown
21 429 postorbital stripes extending posterior to forelimbs, and a single large dark brown

26 432 lacking enlarged dentate tubercles on the tail (vs. present), in lacking a precloacal
27
28 433 groove (vs. present) and its higher number of and darker dorsal bands (6–8 vs. 3
29
30 434 greyish brown); and from C. sermowaiensis by the presence of enlarged femoral
31 435 scales in both sexes (vs. absent), the presence of precloacal and femoral pores in
32
33 436 males (vs. absent), and its longer limbs on average in proportion to SVL (FA/SVL
34
35 437 0.153–0.175 vs. 0.138–0.159).
36 438 Cyrtodactylus tanim n. sp. differs from C. boreoclivus and C. medioclivus in
37
38 439 lacking transversely enlarged subcaudal scales (vs. present), by its smaller size (SVL
39
40 440 <96.7 vs. >97.2 mm), higher total number of femoral/precloacal pores (>83 vs. <62),
41 441 slightly more shallow head (max HD/SVL <0.105 vs. >0.108), and lower number of
42
43 442 dorsal tubercle rows (14–16 vs. 20 [C. medioclivus only]) (Table 2). It occurs in
44
45 443 sympatry with it putative sister taxon, C. capreoloides, at lower elevations, but differs
46 444 from this taxon in its larger size (adult SVL >89.9 vs. <84.0 mm), much longer limbs
47
48 445 (FA/SVL >0.153 vs. <0.147, HDL/SVL 0.183–0.201 vs. 0.164–0.185), fewer dorsal

3 452 Currently known from three sites spanning an elevation from approximately 540 m to
4
5 453 1075 m a.s.l. in near-impenetrable limestone country just east of Kaiangabip Village,
6 454 Western Province, Papua New Guinea. Similar limestone country is widespread, but
7
8 455 difficult to access, along the southern edge of the Central Cordillera, and this species
9
10 456 is likely to have a wider range than is currently known.
11 457 A similar, moderately sized Cyrtodactylus with many dark brown dorsal bands
12
13 458 was seen – but not collected – in limestone areas in the north of Gulf Province [47]. If
14
15 459 this is also Cyrtodactylus tanim n. sp., then it will have a range spanning over 300
16 460 kilometres.
17
18 461 Cyrtodactylus tanim n. sp. was collected in hill forest and lower- montane
19
20 462 forest where it was quite common, especially at higher elevations. Along a ridge of
21 463 lower montane forest at ~1100 m a.s.l (figure 8), up to 10 specimens could reliably be
22
23 464 seen over several hours of spotlighting on a single night. They were most commonly
24
25 465 seen perched at relatively low heights (<3 m above substrate on) limestone surfaces
26 466 on limestone faces, or on nearby small trees, roots, or lianas. Two eggs are visible in
27
28 467 paratypes (SJR14669) and (SJR 14639) at varying stages of development.
29
30 468 Above 1000 m a.s.l. Cyrtodactylus tanim n. sp. was the only gecko present,
31 469 but at the two lower elevation sites (< 900 m a.s.l.) it occurred sympatrically with C.
32
33 470 capreoloides and C. serratus. No habitat segregation with the former was obvious.
34
35 471 Cyrtodactylus serratus appeared to be much rarer (6 specimens in 3 weeks) and was
36 472 observed at greater heights in the forest strata (e.g. on lianas or in larger forest trees
37
38 473 more than 3 m above the ground), suggesting this much larger species is more
39
40 474 arboreal than Cyrtodactylus tanim n. sp.

43 476 3.3.10. Etymology.
44
45 477 “Tanim” is the ‘tokples’ name that the Min people from the mountains of far western
46 478 Papua New Guinea gave for Cyrtodactylus geckos, both on this survey, and earlier
47
48 479 surveys undertaken by Fred Parker in the 1960’s (pers. com.). Several local people
49
50 480 including experienced hunters, showed distaste for Cyrtodactylus geckos, and were
51 481 reluctant to touch, hold or, in the case of large specimens, even look at them.

3 486 4.1. Ecological diversification, specialisation and the exceptional diversification
4
5 487 of Cyrtodactylus
6 488
7
8 489 Cyrtodactylus are an exceptionally species rich lizard clade, currently with over 235
9
10 490 recognised species [48], and with many more being discovered and described each
11 491 year [32]. A key challenge for understanding such large radiations is teasing apart the
12
13 492 relative roles that ecological and non-ecological processes have played in generating
14
15 493 diversity [49]. However, compared to some other similarly diverse lizard radiations
16 494 such as Anolis and Liolaemus [50,51], there has been very little work on the drivers of
17
18 495 diversity across Cyrtodactylus.
19
20 496 Cyrtodactylus tanim n. sp. shows strong evidence of specialisations to use
21 497 complex three dimensional rock habitats such as karst. It has generally longer limbs,
22
23 498 and a flatter head with bigger eyes than similar sized taxa, including all close
24
25 499 relatives. Larger sample sizes of related taxa, and more accurate measurements based
26 500 on key skeletal elements would increase the strength of statistical inference, but most
27
28 501 Melanesian Cyrtodactylus species are rare and housed in collections scattered across
29
30 502 the world. Even with this caveat, the observed trends in morphological characters are
31 503 consistent with background data on how lizard morphology correlates with ecology.
32
33 504 Long limbs may improve centre of gravity and reach in a complex three-dimensional
34
35 505 environment [52]. A smaller and narrower head may be linked to accessing tight
36 506 retreats [11,12]. Larger eyes may relate to using very dark environments such as the
37
38 507 interior of caves and overhangs [14]. While most aspects of head size show evidence
39
40 508 of reduction relative to body length, orbital width shows that opposite trend,
41 509 suggesting divergent but strong selection processes. It is also notable that the new
42
43 510 species was observed regularly on vegetation. This does not undermine the argument
44
45 511 that it is a specialist, as karst microhabitats are likely to be an important and
46 512 inaccessible refuge in which specialist taxa are likely to be difficult to locate.
47
48 513 However it does emphasise how gathering morphological data can complement
49
50 514 observational data when testing hypotheses of specialisation.
51 515 The diversification of Cyrtodactylus across rock ‘islands’ may also be linked
52
53 516 to refugial dynamics [16,17]. However, there is currently no evidence that climatic
54
55 517 refugial processes have played a role in the evolution of Cyrtodactylus tanim. This
56 518 species is partially sympatric with its widespread putative closest relative
57
58 519 Cyrtodactylus capreoloides, and no obvious climatic or rainfall gradients separate
59

2
3 520 these taxa. Dating evidence also suggest it diverged during, not after, the orogeny of
4
5 521 the central fold mountain during the late Miocene/early Pliocene [23]. Both patterns
6 522 are consistent with divergence primarily being linked to ecological opportunity. These
7
8 523 data do not rule out the possibility that historical climatic processes may have played
9
10 524 an initial role in the isolation and divergence of these taxa, but at this stage there is no
11 525 evidence to support such a hypothesis.
12
13 526 This study provides the first evidence of specialisation to saxicoline
14
15 527 microhabitats in New Guinea Cyrtodatylus, and as far we tell, the first evidence of
16 528 specific morphological adaptations to karst in any Cyrtodactylus lineage. It also
17
18 529 suggests (while we did not measure exactly the same characters) parallelism or
19
20 530 convergence with limb proportions and habitus with cave dwelling Cyrtodactylus in
21 531 Indochina [20]. The New Guinea Cyrtodactylus radiation also shows evidence of
22
23 532 parallel evolution of gigantism, suggesting ecological release and diversification
24
25 533 along another axis [21]. These data provide more evidence for an important role for
26 534 ecological diversification in the accumulation of Cyrtodactylus diversity, especially
27
28 535 sympatric taxa, at least in Melanesia. However studies of morphological
29
30 536 diversification in this genus remain patchy and geographically localised, and there
31 537 remain outstanding untapped opportunities to test for parallelism and convergence,
32
33 538 and to better understand the drivers of exceptional diversification.
34
35 539
36 540 4.2. Karst endemism in the tropics
37
38 541
39
40 542 Limestone karst in many tropical and arid regions of the world is home unique
41 543 endemic vertebrate taxa [2–4,53]. However Cyrtodactylus tanim is the first putatively
42
43 544 karst specialist lizard, and probably only the second specialist vertebrate [24],
44
45 545 reported from the vast karsts of New Guinea. We suspect that there are two reasons
46 546 for this contrasting pattern. First, much of the karst in New Guinea is relatively
47
48 547 young, continuous, and has probably not persisted through profound drying events,
49
50 548 providing fewer opportunities for persistence of deeply divergent relictual and
51 549 disjunct endemic lineages. Second, the number of specialists is likely underestimated.
52
53 550 For instance, a number of frog taxa collected in sympatry with Cyrtodactylus tanim
54
55 551 are only known from scattered karst in the southern fold mountains, including
56 552 Callulops medioclivus [54], Choerophryne gracilirostris [55], Cophixalus
57
58 553 caverniphilis [56], Cophixalus wempi [57] and Copiula annanoreenae [58]. These

2
3 554 direct-developing microhylid species in particular are potentially pre-adapted to
4
5 555 heavily dissected karst country with high rainfall but little standing water. Other
6 556 poorly known frog and lizard taxa are also only known from karst areas elsewhere in
7
8 557 New Guinea [59,60]. These data indicate New Guinea may have an as yet largely
9
10 558 unrecognised karst associated vertebrate fauna. Further work to better understand of
11 559 patterns of diversity, specialisation, and endemism in the large but relatively young
12
13 560 karst areas of New Guinea will provide a fascinating contrast against karst biotas
14
15 561 elsewhere in the tropics.

Appendix B
Reviewer 1 states ethical concerns, noting that the authors did not mention how
the freshly collected animals were sacrificed, and specifically asks about the use
of anesthetics.
Additional details have been added to methods to address these concerns.
Furthermore, a Zoobank registration may be required before publication of the
new species. I ask the authors to look into this. Additional remarks listed in
comments to authors should be taken into account.
This is now done and added to manuscript. Could the editor please check
that position and formatting for this information is correct?
Reviewer 2 added remarks to the pdf file of the manuscript, which include
suggestions regarding statistical analyses, data presentation and interpretation.
See responses below
Reviewer: 1
This is a nicely written paper that highlights an interesting aspect of the
understudied biodiversity of New Guinea. I like the combination of a formal
species description with the hypothesis-testing regarding ecomorphological
adaptations to karst habitat in the context of an understudied lizard radiation.
While I hence support the idea and approach behind this paper, and definitely
find the data publishable, there are several instances where I have the
impression that the methodology and conclusions are too poorly explained to be
easily accessible for readers unfamiliar with the body of literature on this
specific taxon or region, making it sometimes difficult to assess how strongly the
data actually support the conclusions.
See detailed responses below
A major flaw of the publication in its current form is that, “Royal Society Open
Science” being an online-only journal, ZooBank registration is required for
publication of a species description: see http://iczn.org/content/electronic-
publication-made-available-amendment-code and references therein. This must
be addressed before this proposed new species can be published.
Fixed – see above
More detailed comments are provided below. I hope the authors find my
suggestions useful.
We do - thank you!
Introduction:
L. 73-74: in which respect is Cyrtodactylus the most diverse gecko genus?
Genetic diversity, species number…?
Species number – now changed to “speciose”
L. 98: something wrong here: “in the west and… [?]”
Errant ‘and’ deleted
M&M:
L. 129: could the authors please explain the choice of marker? I have no problem
with it per se, but would like to see a justification for readers unfamiliar with this
taxon.
Sentence now reads: To ensure maximal compatibility with published sequence
data for Cyrtodactylus we amplified new sequence data from the NADH
dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) for four samples of the new species (SJR13150,
14640, 14709, 14743), in addition to two samples of Cyrtodactylus capreoloides
collected sympatrically (SJR 14746, PMO19).
L. 131: so Cyrtodactylus capreoloides was collected sympatrically with the
currently newly described species? Hence it partly occurs also in karstic habitat,
then, but also elsewhere? Has it been tested whether similar ecomorphological
adaptations exist in this species?
C. capreoloides does not show as strong evidence of a divergent
morphology (unlike the new species described here), and it also occurs in
habitats away from karst (see methods section 2.4 and Figure 2). He we do
not consider it likely to be a specialist at this stage.
L. 137-141: the methodology could use a bit more details here to become
reproducible: settings for the alignment algorithm, model used, number of
bootstrap replicates…?
Additional details have been added to the Methods to aid reproducibility.
See lines 159-213.
Regarding the Melanesian radiation, what kind of taxon coverage was included in
the dataset (about 50% across the entire genus, is mentioned later on)?
Have added this sentence: “This alignment included 107 out of ~240 nominal
Cyrtodactylus species globally, and 22 out of 25 recognised species from
Melanesia.”
L. 142-145: also here, the methodology could be better explained. Which four
genes? Are sequences of all four genes also available for the new species of
Cyrtodactylus?
Following Sentence added: “This alignment included ND2 for all taxa, plus three
nuclear genes (MXRA-5, RAG-1 and Phosducin) for a reduced number of taxa.”
See below re comment on sampling for new taxa.
I actually have the impression that only one marker is available for the new
species (and for its close relatives, like C. capreoloides, C. medioclivus and C.
boreoclivus). Such missing data can be a problem when building “supertrees”
(e.g. Simmons, 2014, Mol. Phylogenet. Evol.). Could the authors comment on this,
do they expect an influence of this on the tree reconstruction and dating based
on the concatenated dataset?
This impression is correct. However, from working with a number of
comparable relatively shallow and rapid lizard radiation, genomic data is
really needed to properly investigate relationships within what looks to be
a relatively rapid radiation of Melanesian Cyrtodactylus. This is beyond the
scope (and budget) of this current project. Accordingly, we emphasise a
number of points in the manuscript that the inferred relationships of the
new species should be considered tentative.
L. 145-148: why assume that the GTR+G model is most suitable for all partitions?
Why assume that the nuclear data can be treated as a single partition?
Based on previous study featuring a near identical alignment (only 2 extra
species in this alignment) these models and partitioning strategies were
supported. Reference to relevant study is now given (line 201).
L. 190-192: how did you define “similar-sized” (how did you choose the specified
size window?) and “very large” etc.? Of course, one always makes a certain
qualitative choice when deciding which species to include in an analysis, but
since you are explicitly testing some morphological hypothesis I feel that the
selection of comparative data should be better justified.
Fair question. Our baseline was to exclude a number of very small (<
75mm) and very large species (>115 mm) species that occur in New Guinea
to decrease the possibility that non-allometric growth is species at ends of
the size extreme would confound patterns. Including a reduced number of
similar sized species seems to be the most conservative approach. This
sampling also allowed us to include both closely, and distantly related
species in comparisons, providing a more effective assessment of the
morphological divergence of the new species.
Results:
L. 218-219 and Fig. 1: How do the authors delineate this “Australo-Papuan”
radiation – I don’t see it indicated in the figure or figure legend?
This is a geographically coherant clade of Melanesian and Australian taxa
that tends to receive strong to moderate support in all analyses, as well as
in a number of other recently published studies (now clearly demarcated
in Fig. 1)
Also, what do the authors call strongly supported? Based on the caption of Fig. 1,
I’d guess the authors use a cut-off of PP 0.9 for the Bayesian analysis and 70% for
the maximum likelihood one – is that such a “strong” support? By the way, why is
the 70% bootstrap support called “significant” – that reminds me of a statistical
test? And how does this correspond to the authors later on calling a support of
1.0/81% “moderate” (L. 220-221) and 0.88/60% “low” (L. 227)?
These cut off values for what values to report are (as always) somewhat
arbitrary, they are just to give a sense of some relationships can be viewed
with more confidence than others. To really dig into the strength of
support of relationships between these taxa – genomic datasets will be
required.
L. 219: what do the authors call “phylogenetically very distant”? Given that we’re
looking at a cladogram, and in the absence of genetic distances provided
anywhere else, and of a clear delineation of what is considered to be inside and
outside of this Australo-Papuan radiation, this seems a quite relative expression
to me.
Hopefully the definition if the Australo-Papuan radiation is now clearer on
Figure 1, and we have also removed the ‘very’, and specified that we
estimate the splits to be mid-Miocene or older.
L. 223: typographical error: “Crytodactylus”- fixed
L. 225-226: if these two species are only clustering with a low support and their
genetic divergence is quite substantial, couldn’t there just be an issue with
missing taxa here?
Possibly, but our sampling of the described Melanesian species is quite
comprehensive (22 out 25), so it is unlikely that adding extra described
taxa will change the story. But we do also emphasise at several points in
the manuscript that the inferred relationship is not unequivocally
supported. As noted above, additional genomic data might be better
elucidate these relationships, but is beyond the scope of the current
project.
Discussion:
I like how this well-written and rich discussion brings a lot of the mentioned
results into perspective, and how it links morphological adaptations to their
potential function. I was wondering whether the authors could also discuss the
colour pattern of the new species, given they mention potential colour pattern
adaptation in “cave” species (L. 81-82)?
Thank you. We could – but in truth it simply does not match, the other
species from caves have very thin light bands on a plain brown
background, our new species has many jagged dark bands on a messy
brown background. At this preliminary stage of understanding speculating
on specific patterns of colour pattern evolution across Cyrtodactylus
seemed just a bit too speculative and distracting.
L. 542-543: something wrong with the construction of this sentence
Fixed –“ Limestone karsts in many tropical and arid regions of the world are
home to unique endemic vertebrate taxa”
L. 549: it is not entirely clear to me what you mean by the number of specialists
being underestimated. Do you mean that a lot of species are known that occur in
(or are even confined to) karst habitat, but of which the functional
specialisation/adaptation has not been studied yet?
Correct – now reads: “Second, most taxa from New Guinea are very poorly
known, and in the absence of studies of functional specialisation and adaptation,
the number of karst specialists is likely to be underestimated.”

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a very good paper and augments the work of other authors exploring
gekkonid ecomorphology. My only very minor criticism is the inconsistent and
ambiguous rhetoric found in a few places of the manuscript which I have marked
on the .pdf. I have made several small editorial changes to the ms and I have
made a number of comments that the authors and the editors should consider.
But nothing major. This ms is in good shape and after a few minor adjustments
should be ready for publication.
Thank you for your comments, edits and suggestions. We have gone
through and accepted nearly all of the proposed changes, including
clarifying a number of small mistakes picked up.
As requested we have also added a table of eigenvalues and summary data
from PCA analyses to supplementary material.
We have also corrected a number of issues with terminology, especially
with respect to following traits and characters – supranasal (formerly
nasal) scales, ventrolateral (formerly lateral) folds, and orbital (formerly
eye)
All other changes should be clear on the uploaded tracked changes version
of the manuscript.
