secondary statistics and modeled values. This would give researchers a better view of the actual
radiocarbon data included in this analysis. And it would facilitate true replication. The
supplementary figures are clearly referenced in the text. However, the captions for the
supplementary figures could be more thoroughly descriptive (and in general, the analytical
methods could be more thoroughly described and justified, perhaps in the supplementary

This manuscript presents the results of a fairly simple binary test of a pervasive, divisive, and
dichotomous question in the origins of agriculture literature: did some kind of population-
resource imbalance drive the domestication of taxa that underwrote the agricultural revolution,
or not? Specifically, this research focuses on one empirical approach to answering this question:
did human population increase significantly and prior to the early appearance of domestic plants
in eastern North America? The authors argue that indeed human population did increase
significantly in the very region where these novel taxa first appeared. By extension, they argue
that the increase in human population is a suitable first-order measure of population-resource
imbalance, and that this imbalance drove the evolution of the domestic taxa associated with the
Eastern Agricultural Complex of North America. They further suggest that the results of this test
conform to the economic and evolutionary expectations of behavioral ecology, a body of theory
that, among other things, asserts that increases in predator (in this case, human) populations will
reduce the abundance of high-ranked prey (for example large bodied animals like deer) before
expanding attention to low-ranked prey (for example small seeded plants like Chenopodiaceae).
The logic here is that the selective environment that drives plant domestication is unlikely to
evolve unless human predators intensify their efforts on the wild forms of those plants, and that
this is unlikely to happen unless the abundance of more productive resources has been
substantially reduced. This stands in stark contrast to alternative explanations for domestication
(namely niche construction theory) which have been harnessed to assert that humans might shift
their attention to low-ranked seed plants simply by increasing the abundance of them (through
various forms of intentional environmental manipulation). What makes the authors’ test possible
is that the latter theoretical perspective does not require the imbalance between predator
populations and food supply, whereas the former does. These “times of plenty” versus “times of
stress” scenarios for the origins of domestication and agriculture have been revisited in various
formats for several decades (see Bettinger etal 2015; Barton 2009; Price & Gebauer 1995). The
current approach to this age-old debate is fresh, clean, clear, and robust. It is a coherent test of
theoretically informed expectations, and it marshals a sizeable dataset for the testing.
Though some readers might take issue with a few implications from this analysis, these are
subjective issues, and will not feature in this decision! Yet I will point out that the authors deal
with them sufficiently. One is the question of whether the population-resource imbalance is a
result of population increase or environmental change. The authors admit that both might be at
work, however they might be more explicit that this is a test of population, not environment, and
that the latter might even be assumed as a constant (all things being equal). Another issue readers
might have is to wonder whether this test constitutes acceptance or rejection of different
theoretical perspectives; the authors are clear that it does not. This is simply a test of hypotheses,
and is therefore solid science.
3
So, the research design is clear and concise. However, the analysis is not entirely, and this is my
primary critique. Surely this can be resolved, perhaps in the text, more likely in supplementary
information.
The first issue is in the selection of radiocarbon data. What, for example, do the authors really
mean by “chronometric hygiene” (p.4, line 31)? And how does this square with the inclusion of
dates with large standard deviations (for example)? The second half of this paragraph is a little
unconvincing. At the very least, this attempt at good “hygiene” ought to be spelled out. The
statement that Miller’s settlement pattern analysis corroborates the models and results seems like
inappropriate justification at the end of this paragraph (and I simply don’t get it).
The second issue is that the primary data incorporated in this study have not been included in the
online supplementary information. Though the primary data are accessible online, through the
Canadian Archaeological Radiocarbon Database (CARD), they are not provided here.
The third issue is with the explanation and justification of the analytical methods. This sits
entirely in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th paragraphs of the “Methods” section. How, for example, are the
figures, both in the text, and in the supplementary information, generated? The tools and
methods appear to be referenced adequately, but there is very little explanation. Might this
methodology be explained in a concise fashion in the supplementary materials? A close cousin to
this third issue is that some of the methods employed (for example Surovell et al’s 2009
taphonomic correction) are not universally accepted. Objectively, this might be ok, and the
authors do not depend on the correction factor entirely (for example they note where it might
introduce anomalies in various parts of the temporal sequence). But there is a growing literature
on the generation, use, and interpretation of summed probability distributions of radiocarbon age
estimates, and this literature has not been dealt with here.
A thorough presentation of the primary data, and a clearer explanation of the statistical tools, and
the justification for them, would ensure replicability AND reproducibility of this concise scientific
test.
A few minor points that do not affect the decision of this review but might be helpful
nevertheless…
- p.3, line 18: delete “these” (between “hypotheses” and “throughout”).
- P.3, line 53: consider replacing “a proxy” with “proxies”.
- P.5, line 32: again, what were the “hygiene protocols”?
- P.7, line 8 (and elsewhere throughout): use of broad temporal eras like “Late Holocene”
are really confusing in this paper; the analyses are about absolute ages and ranges, whereas
“early” “middle” and “late” designations are relative, amorphous, inexact, and detract from the
presentation.
- P.7, line 24: I wonder about the kinds of settlement pattern data capable of revealing
demographic packing. A recent book (Drennan etal 2015) looks at this carefully.
- P.7, line 49: Piperno & Persall deal with more than just “South America” in their lengthy
treatise on the Neotropics. Consider discussing “domestication events in the New World
lowlands” or the “Neotropical forests”.
- P.8, line 35. Change to, “It is possible that wild foods could not sustain high human
populations in the …”
- P.8, line 36. On a macro-evolutionary scale, domestication might be seen as an “optimal
response to low foraging profitability.” But that’s only true if domestication alters return rates
(and we know that eventually it does). The real question in the evolution of domesticates is how
people and wild plants enter the environment of selection that changes them both. And (see
below…)
4
- P.8, line 44. Declining foraging return rates explain diet breadth expansion and
land/labor/resource intensification; they seem less likely a motivation for domestication.
- P.9, line 52. What are the “costs of domestication”??
- P.12 line 44. Incomplete reference for Carmody 2014
- Figure 1. Change “a” to alpha.

This is a provocative paper that is sure to stimulate further discussion of the role of population
growth and resource depression in initial domestication. The data the authors present offer a
counterargument to the (unsubstantiated, facile, and illogical) generalization that resource
"richness" leads to domestication. In doing so they mount a defense of HBE as a theoretical
perspective. For these reasons I would very much like to see a version of it published. The
authors may be overstating their empirical case somewhat, but they make the important point
that niche construction-based explanations of this transition as currently formulated are weak
and fail to address causality except by (seemingly) invoking human nature. They also advocate
an evolutionary approach to behavior that explicitly
links domestication and agriculture to natural selection favoring efficient resource use. Most
current conversations about agricultural origins fail to make this connection, relying instead on
implicit assumptions that humans are motivated to enhance resource abundance and/or
reliability. Those who insist that resource stress was not a factor in this transition have not offered
any detailed account of population trends in ENA, offering only impressionistic statements about
site densities and locations.
The use of radiocarbon date frequencies to assess demographic trends is not a perfect method,
but neither are any of the other methods commonly used. The authors do their best to minimize
confounding biases and they draw on other approaches and data sets for additional support.
They are engaging directly with a vulnerable element of the anti-resource depression argument
(that population densities were low just prior to initial domestication) and find that support for it
is weak.
The authors have adopted the stance that the resource depression argument for initial
domestication is aligned with behavioral ecology and the stress-free argument with niche
construction theory. Although this characterization is useful in the context of the article, the
authors are careful to point out that BE and NCT are not opposed to each other in the same way
that the two hypotheses are.

To the editor,
Weitzel and Codding present an analysis of radiocarbon dates from eastern North America to
argue that the origins of agriculture was preceded by population growth. They argue that their
results are consistent with explanations for the origins of agriculture that draw on human
behavioral ecology as opposed to those that call on niche construction.
I recommend this paper for publication with very minor revision. I also have a few
recommendations to either incorporate into this draft, or as fodder for future publications.
1) In the title, I would suggest replacing “explains” with “was a causal factor” or similar wording.
2) I thought the background section was concise, yet strong. However, I would recommend
spelling out that niche construction theory as applied by Smith and Zeder is not really consistent
with the original formulation by Odling-Smee. According to Odling-Smee, there’s a payoff for
individuals altering their local environments.
To put it bluntly, beavers are not passively building dams for the hell of it. They are actively
altering the local habitat to increase the number of plants that they feed on. That explanation is
consistent with behavioral ecology AND niche construction. I find how Smith and Zeder employ
niche construction as trying to make one work without the other. The authors dance around this
in the conclusion of the article, and it would be nice if they made that point more forcefully.
3) I found their radiocarbon analysis compelling, although I wonder how the appearance of shell
middens and earthen mounds in the Middle and Late Archaic and into the Early Woodland could
generate peaks and troughs in the data. In others, these are locations that archaeologists are more
likely to focus on and are also more likely to contain preserved organic material.
Also, did they also search for redundant lab numbers as well as Smithsonian Trinomials?
4) The analysis is fairly complex, and I think it would be nice if the authors created simulations of
constant population, exponential population growth, and random population fluctuations. Then
based off of those simulations, generate frequencies of radiocarbon dates over time. If their
analysis is as robust as it seems, it should easily distinguish the simulations from each other.
In other words, create a “sandbox” with simulated data to show the readers that aren’t as savvy
with statistics that the approach can distinguish different patterns in the archaeological data.
5) The authors summed up the conclusion of my dissertation better than I did.

with statistics that the approach can distinguish different patterns in the archaeological data.

ar Editor,
Thank you very much for overseeing the review of our manuscript and for providing such
pful suggestions and comments. We have made the changes which you and the three
iewers have requested. which has greatly improved the manuscript. In particular, the
owing revisions especially strengthened the manuscript: the clarification of our use of the
adian Archaeological Radiocarbon Database (CARD), the expanded discussion of problems
h using radiocarbon dates as a proxy measure of human population levels, the further
lanation of our methods, especially the use of generalized additive modeling, the elaborated
cussion of niche construction theory in the biological vs archaeological literature, and the
eration of simulated radiocarbon models of exponentially increasing and zero growth
ulations. We thank the reviewers for their support of this paper and their constructive
dback, and additionally thank Reviewer #1 for calling our attention to several typos and
mmar mistakes in the manuscript. We respond point by point below to the comments and
dback we received.
iewer #3: “In the title, I would suggest replacing “explains” with “was a causal factor” or
ilar wording.”
We appreciate Reviewer #3’s perspective on this, and have come to agree that our
inal title may have been too bold and, to use the words of Reviewer #2, overstated our case.
have now changed our title to “Population growth prior to 5000 cal BP as a causal force for
ial domestication in Eastern North America.”
iewer #1: “What, for example, do the authors really mean by “chronometric hygiene” (p.4,
31)? And how does this square with the inclusion of dates with large standard deviations
example)? The second half of this paragraph is a little unconvincing. At the very least, this
mpt at good “hygiene” ought to be spelled out. The statement that Miller’s settlement pattern
lysis corroborates the models and results seems like inappropriate justification at the end of
paragraph (and I simply don’t get it).”
iewer #2 “The use of radiocarbon date frequencies to assess demographic trends is not a
fect method, but neither are any of the other methods commonly used. The authors do their
t to minimize confounding biases and they draw on other approaches and data sets for
itional support.”
iewer #3: “I found their radiocarbon analysis compelling, although I wonder how the
earance of shell middens and earthen mounds in the Middle and Late Archaic and into the
ly Woodland could generate peaks and troughs in the data. In others, these are locations that
haeologists are more likely to focus on and are also more likely to contain preserved organic
erial.”
We appreciate the concerns of all Reviewers regarding chronometric hygiene, potential
blems with the method of using radiocarbon dates as a proxy for population, and our lack of
ail in discussing our decisions. To address these concerns, we have re-organized and
anded our methods section, and have added a subsection within our discussion section that
resses this issue. Our use of the phrase “chronometric hygiene” refers to the decisions we
de concerning how to best make use of the radiocarbon database. By the standards of previous
earch using the CARD and other radiocarbon databases, we employ fairly rigorous criteria for
cting radiocarbon dates to include in our analysis which reduces the risk of inaccurate results
m our models. However, like others making use of this method, we are unable to fully control
the effects of preservation biases and researcher bias in preferential dating of certain
onological periods. We have tried to be explicit in our revisions as to these shortcomings and
ke such potential sources of error unambiguously clear. As we write in our discussion, we do
believe preservation conditions, specifically resulting from increased abundance of shell-
ring deposits, to have a great impact on our results since the timing of peak shellfish use (in
Woodland period according to Peacock 2002) and the local peak in human population at
00 cal BP do not coincide. We are, however, unable to ensure that researcher bias is not at
y. We make this potential source of error explicit and encourage future work to investigate
possibility.
iewer #1: “How, for example, are the figures, both in the text, and in the supplementary
rmation, generated? The tools and methods appear to be referenced adequately, but there is
y little explanation. Might this methodology be explained in a concise fashion in the
plementary materials? A close cousin to this third issue is that some of the methods employed
example Surovell et al’s 2009 taphonomic correction) are not universally accepted.
ectively, this might be ok, and the authors do not depend on the correction factor entirely (for
mple they note where it might introduce anomalies in various parts of the temporal
uence). But there is a growing literature on the generation, use, and interpretation of summed
bability distributions of radiocarbon age estimates, and this literature has not been dealt with
e.”
Reviewer #1 is justified in questioning our methodology, specifically our use of
eralized additive models (GAMs) and our use of taphonomic correction. In our revisions, we
e attempted to clarify that GAMs allow for the necessary resolution of “local” fluctuations in
ulation that would be missed by a more strictly parsimonious model such as a single
ynomial generalized linear model (GLM). It is the local peaks and troughs in this model that
mit us to draw conclusions about what human populations are doing prior to initial
mestication. The analysis of the first derivative of the GAM then permits statements
cerning the significance of any increases or decreases in population through time. When the
t derivative (rate of change) of the model is significantly different from zero, populations are
er significantly increasing or decreasing.
The taphonomic correction is, as the reviewer states, not universally accepted and is not
ant to be universally applicable by the authors who proposed it. Reviewer #1 correctly notes
our analysis does not depend on this taphonomic correction, as we provide uncorrected
dels as well, but in our revised manuscript we have now discussed the fact that the correction
ation proposed by Surovell et al. 2009 is the most widely accepted means by which the
honomic loss of archaeological materials may be counteracted in these kinds of analyses.
honomic loss and preservation issues are certainly universally at play, and until more refined
regionally-oriented methods of correction are proposed, we follow the precedent of using
ovell et al.’s equation.
In line with the observation that we did not fully engage with the literature concerning
med probability distributions of radiocarbon dates, we have expanded our discussion of the
hodological approach used here relative to other approaches. We also re-organized our
hod section so future readers can more easily follow our steps and apply them to their data.
additional supplementary information on simulations (more below), will also help future
ders in this regard.
iewer #3: “The analysis is fairly complex, and I think it would be nice if the authors created
ulations of constant population, exponential population growth, and random population
tuations. Then based off of those simulations, generate frequencies of radiocarbon dates over
e. If their analysis is as robust as it seems, it should easily distinguish the simulations from
h other.
ther words, create a “sandbox” with simulated data to show the readers that aren’t as savvy
h statistics that the approach can distinguish different patterns in the archaeological data.”
We appreciate this suggestion from Reviewer #3 and agree that it would be very useful.
have therefore generated the requested simulations of constant/random and exponentially
wing populations and included these in our supplementary materials. Specifically, we
erated ideal growing and zero growth populations using the logistic growth equation,
pled these population records following Contreras and Meadows, and applied our GAM
ed method, repeating this 1000 times. The result shows where each approach is likely to
erate error (which will be valuable for future applications) and confirms our findings which
robust across multiple methods.
iewer #1: “The second issue is that the primary data incorporated in this study have not been
uded in the online supplementary information. Though the primary data are accessible
ine, through the Canadian Archaeological Radiocarbon Database (CARD), they are not
vided here.”
Unfortunately, due to the sensitive nature of the data contained in the CARD and the
rictions imposed by the database administrators concerning who may access their data, we
unable to provide these data as supplementary information. The CARD maintains strict
tocols for accessing their database which would be unethical to circumvent. We do recognize
need to supply our data, however these CARD data are not ours to supply. We provide all
del results from our analyses as supplementary data and make clear that researchers wishing
eplicate our research or conduct their own using CARD should contact the administrators for
mission to access the database as we did.
iewer #3: “I thought the background section was concise, yet strong. However, I would
ommend spelling out that niche construction theory as applied by Smith and Zeder is not
lly consistent with the original formulation by Odling-Smee. According to Odling-Smee,
re’s a payoff for individuals altering their local environments.
put it bluntly, beavers are not passively building dams for the hell of it. They are actively
ring the local habitat to increase the number of plants that they feed on. That explanation is
sistent with behavioral ecology AND niche construction. I find how Smith and Zeder employ
he construction as trying to make one work without the other. The authors dance around this
he conclusion of the article, and it would be nice if they made that point more forcefully.”
iewer #2 “They also advocate an evolutionary approach to behavior that explicitly links
estication and agriculture to natural selection favoring efficient resource use. Most current
versations about agricultural origins fail to make this connection, relying instead on implicit
umptions that humans are motivated to enhance resource abundance and/or reliability. Those
o insist that resource stress was not a factor in this transition have not offered any detailed
ount of population trends in ENA, offering only impressionistic statements about site
sities and locations.”
We agree with Reviewer #3 concerning the differences between the Odling-Smee et al.
mulation of niche construction theory and the current form employed by Smith and Zeder. We
agree with Reviewer #2 that it is essential to clearly articulate the theoretical relationship
ween behavioral ecology and niche construction theory regarding domestication. In our
ised discussion, we have included an expanded sub-section in which we elaborat on these
erences between niche construction theory in biology and anthropology, and highlight the
that the compatibility of behavioral ecology and niche construction theory is not a view
que to us We also touch on some of the debates in biology regarding niche construction and
they support our perspective.
iewer #3: “Also, did they also search for redundant lab numbers as well as Smithsonian
nomials?”
We appreciate Reviewer #3 catching this oversight on our part. Yes, we did ensure that
redundant lab numbers were used in our analysis. We have now stated that in our manuscript.
We thank you, the editor, and the three reviewers for the time, effort, and careful
ntion paid to the details of our manuscript. The paper has been significantly strengthened by
se revisions and we hope that you see it fit for publication. Of course, if there are any
stions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us at any time.
