The manuscript by Kwon et al describes an important diagnostic assay to distinguish between
two independent contagious cancers in the Tasmanian devil, DFT1 and DFT2. This assay is of
significant practical importance due to the highly negative impact of contagious cancers on the
devil population and the similarity in gross structural features of DFT1 and DFT2. The PCR based
assay makes use of unique chromosomal rearrangements in the two tumours compared to host
devils. The authors use their results to draw conclusions on the geographic spread of DFT1 and
DFT2, co-infection of hosts with the two tumours and a possible sex bias in infection of males.
Overall, this is a very clearly written paper and the interpretation of the results is valid.
A couple of minor points below:
Page 3, line 19 – remove ‘there’ and insert ‘in this area’ for clarity
Page 3, line 45 – insert may ‘not’
Results:
When reading the paper it is difficult pick up the definition of the markers DFT1-B and DFT2-B as
these are not defined in the Results or in Figure 1. After going back through the paper and
methods I gathered these were alternative primers for screening. This could be made clearer by
incorporating the definition of these markers into the Results (potentially the paragraph
beginning on line 19 of page 4) and into Figure 1.
Was there a reason that the ‘A’ markers were used to design the diagnostic test? If both markers
were trialled and one was superior the reasons for this should be included in the Results or
Methods.

Tasmanian devils are an iconic Australian marsupial that is suffering from not one but two
infectious clonal cancers. This paper describes a new PCR based method for distinguishing
between DFT1 and DFT2. DFTD tumours from all across the state have been tested using this
method, as well as tumours which are non-DFTD. This is a valuable piece of work and should be
published with changes suggested below for clarification.
There are lots of different samples sizes presented throughout the manuscript and this is very
difficult to follow. As the methods are presented after the results, and Table 2 with the sample
sizes is not presented until the discussion it makes the paper hard to follow. Please revise how
you are presenting the different sample sizes. That is, how many tumours were tested, and of
these tumours how many were DFTD; how many devils were these tumours collected from and
how many devils had suspected DFTD tumours. Please present these different sample sizes in the
first paragraph of the results as this makes it easier to interpret the results and the discussion.
A large portion of the method seems to be missing in regards to the microsatellite genotyping.
Although using an established method from Pye et al, please provide a summary of the
microsatellite genotyping, how many microsatellites were used, what was the genotyping error
rate etc.
Specific comments
To make it easier to review please provide line numbers on your manuscript in the future.
Introduction – first para; is it Channel or Channel Peninsula, the authors only use Channel in the
introduction but use Channel Peninsula elsewhere, please be consistent
Be careful of the over use of “Furthermore”
Last three sentences of the introduction should be in the results.
Results first paragraph – your sentence length is too long. Please consider shortening sentences
and using less commas for ease of reading.
Distribution of DFT1 & DFT2, 63 locations here but earlier in the results 64 locations; and 56
locations; and then in the discussion it says 69 locations. If you are losing locations due to some of
the analysis please clarify this.
DFT1 & DFT2 host gender – sentence structure in the last part of this paragraph needs to be
reconsidered.
Second paragraph of the discussion should come towards the end of the discussion as it separates
the two paragraphs that are discussing the results. This makes it difficult to follow.
Methods – please add in sample sizes for the biopsies from wild and captive devils and for the
subset of tumours. Am unsure why the tables in the methods do not have any titles.
Please provide the supplier information for the primer information.
How did you score the PCRs as I am assuming not all gel results were equal? Please provide
details of scoring and any associated cut-offs. Did you need to re-run any of the gels as they did
not work? Did you get any false positive results and if so, how were these dealt with?
Tables – Table 2 is only presented in the results but is an excellent summary of your sample sizes.
Refer to my comment above in regards to the sample size being presented earlier in the results.
Figure 2 – please change text to “Locations of 492 confirmed or suspected DFTD tumours…”.
Text in this figure is small and difficult to read.
Figure 4 – contrast on Image A is poor and so tumours are difficult to see; also with B)T2 the

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript by Kwon et al describes an important diagnostic assay to
distinguish between two independent contagious cancers in the Tasmanian
devil, DFT1 and DFT2. This assay is of significant practical importance due
to the highly negative impact of contagious cancers on the devil population
and the similarity in gross structural features of DFT1 and DFT2. The PCR
based assay makes use of unique chromosomal rearrangements in the two
tumours compared to host devils. The authors use their results to draw
conclusions on the geographic spread of DFT1 and DFT2, co-infection of
hosts with the two tumours and a possible sex bias in infection of males.
Overall, this is a very clearly written paper and the interpretation of the results
is valid.
A couple of minor points below:
Page 3, line 19 – remove ‘there’ and insert ‘in this area’ for clarity
> We have changed the phrasing of this sentence for clarity.
Page 3, line 45 – insert may ‘not’
> We have added ‘may be present or may have previously existed’ to the
sentence to clarify that we are suggesting that there may currently be, or may
have previously been, additional undetected DFT clones within the devil
population.
Results:
When reading the paper it is difficult pick up the definition of the markers
DFT1-B and DFT2-B as these are not defined in the Results or in Figure 1.
After going back through the paper and methods I gathered these were
alternative primers for screening. This could be made clearer by incorporating
the definition of these markers into the Results (potentially the paragraph
beginning on line 19 of page 4) and into Figure 1.
> We now introduce DFT1-B and DFT2-B in the text (page 4, line 13).
Was there a reason that the ‘A’ markers were used to design the diagnostic
test? If both markers were trialled and one was superior the reasons for this
should be included in the Results or Methods.
> A section headed ‘Selection of markers’, which explains how markers were
selected, has been added to the Methods section (page 10, line 15).

and this is very difficult to follow. As the methods are presented after the
results, and Table 2 with the sample sizes is not presented until the discussion
it makes the paper hard to follow. Please revise how you are presenting the
different sample sizes. That is, how many tumours were tested, and of these
tumours how many were DFTD; how many devils were these tumours
collected from and how many devils had suspected DFTD tumours. Please
present these different sample sizes in the first paragraph of the results as this
makes it easier to interpret the results and the discussion.
> We thank the reviewer for this useful suggestion. We have added a new
table (Table 2), which summarises sample sizes and screening results. This is
introduced at the beginning of the Results section.
A large portion of the method seems to be missing in regards to the
microsatellite genotyping. Although using an established method from Pye et
al, please provide a summary of the microsatellite genotyping, how many
microsatellites were used, what was the genotyping error rate etc.
> We have added more information in the Methods to clarify the number of
microsatellites used. We did not directly measure genotyping error rate.
However, in this study, microsatellite genotyping was primarily used to
confirm identical alleles between separate biopsies sampled from individual
devils. As results were consistent with expectations (see Table S2), we are
satisfied that genotyping errors did not affect the conclusions of the study.
Specific comments
To make it easier to review please provide line numbers on your manuscript in
the future.
> We have added line numbers to the resubmitted manuscript.
Introduction – first para; is it Channel or Channel Peninsula, the authors only
use Channel in the introduction but use Channel Peninsula elsewhere, please
be consistent
> We have amended the text to use Channel Peninsula for references to this
location.
Be careful of the over use of “Furthermore”
> We replaced some instances of ‘furthermore’ with ‘moreover’ and
‘additionally’.
Last three sentences of the introduction should be in the results.
> We removed the last three sentences of the introduction.
Results first paragraph – your sentence length is too long. Please consider
shortening sentences and using less commas for ease of reading.
> We split the long sentence into two sentences.
Distribution of DFT1 & DFT2, 63 locations here but earlier in the results 64
locations; and 56 locations; and then in the discussion it says 69 locations. If
you are losing locations due to some of the analysis please clarify this.
> The numbers of locations mentioned in the text for the various subsets of
individuals and tumours are correct. The precise locations can be found in
Tables S1 and S3.
DFT1 & DFT2 host gender – sentence structure in the last part of this
paragraph needs to be reconsidered.
> We are unsure what part of this paragraph the reviewer is referring to.
Second paragraph of the discussion should come towards the end of the
discussion as it separates the two paragraphs that are discussing the results.
This makes it difficult to follow.
> The second paragraph describes limitations of the method, which we believe
the reader should consider for interpretation of the remaining discussion. We
therefore prefer to retain the original discussion structure.
Methods – please add in sample sizes for the biopsies from wild and captive
devils and for the subset of tumours.
> Captive devils have locations noted as ‘captive’ in Tables S1 and S3. Those
that are not marked as captive are wild.
Am unsure why the tables in the methods do not have any titles.
> The two tables in the Methods list the primers and PCR amplification
conditions and are introduced as part of the Methods text.
Please provide the supplier information for the primer information.
> Primer supplier information has been added (page 11, line 5).
How did you score the PCRs as I am assuming not all gel results were equal?
Please provide details of scoring and any associated cut-offs. Did you need to
re-run any of the gels as they did not work? Did you get any false positive
results and if so, how were these dealt with?
> Tasman-PCR has an internal positive control (RPL13A). Samples which
failed to amplify RPL13A were not included in the study. Samples with weak
bands were re-run with increased DNA input; this has now been clarified in
the Methods (page 12, line 4). We did identify a number of false positives,
and these are discussed in the text (page 4, beginning line 26).
Tables – Table 2 is only presented in the results but is an excellent summary
of your sample sizes. Refer to my comment above in regards to the sample
size being presented earlier in the results.
> We have introduced a new table that more explicitly lists sample sizes
(Table 2; see comment earlier in response to reviewers). The previous Table 2
has now become Table 3.
Figure 2 – please change text to “Locations of 492 confirmed or suspected
DFTD tumours…”.
> This sentence is explaining that the figure displays locations of 494 tumours
that amplified either DFT1-A or DFT2-A. Thus, it is implicit that these
tumours are DFTD, and, arguably, all of them are now confirmed as DFTD.
Text in this figure is small and difficult to read.
> We have increased the text size in Figure 2 by two font sizes.
Figure 4 – contrast on Image A is poor and so tumours are difficult to see; also
with B)T2 the tumour is difficult to see
> We increased the contrast to make tumour T2 clearer in (B). We have also
added an arrow pointing to T2 in (A).
