This ms concerns a well designed, well executed and well analysed study. The results are clear
and the interpretation and discussion are well thought over. The statistcs used in the anaylsis are
properly executed. The work refers adequately to previous studies in the literature. The quality of
the work evidently prooves the relationship between psychiatric institutions and railway suicides
in the vicinity. This has a major implication for prevention of suicides in the vicinity of
psychiatric centres. The choice of the number of beds in an institution is a good choice since it
takes into consideration the size of the psychiatric instuitutions. My compliments.
I would recommend acceptance of the ms as it is. There aren only three minor suggestions:
1. In the abstract mention is made of possible traumatisation of train drivers and passengers. I
would plea for the inclusion of another category of potentialy traumatised persons: those who are
responsible for collecting the body parts alongside the track and clean up the mess / train. I have
treated some of these persons for serious PTSD symptoms because of their duties.
2. In the method section something was initially not clear to me: in 2.1. first sentence there is
written that the data on suicides and attempted suicides are collected, and later on that data on
attempted suicides are removed. This was a little bit confusing since from the first reading it
appeared that suicides as well as suicide attemptes were included. Perhaps it would be easier to
read if the collection of data on attempted suicide wasn't mentioned at all, so that the reader only
reads texts and data on suicides. On the other hand, I would be very interested if the authors
could also do the analysis on the combined dataset of suicides and attempted suicides. I would
expect the results to be similar.
3. in section 2.2. Testing the possible influence of psychiatries the word psychiatries is introduced.
I am not a native speaker of English, but I never saw the word psychiatries used for psychiatric
institutions or psychiatric cenres. Is thi correct?

Review of: Suicides on the railway, Austria, 1998-2009: Hotspot analysis on the Austrian railway
network and the effect of proximity to psychiatric hospitals
For: Royal Society Open Science
Date: 11-25-16
1. Summary. Suicide is a leading cause of mortality in Europe and North American,
especially for men. The present study assesses the nature of suicide by train (railway suicide) in
relation to clustering effects. If suicide follows geospatial clustering (hotpots), there are
implications for prevention of a portion of suicides. A key focus of the present study is on the
proximity of hospitals, with mental patient departments, to railway stations. According to some
investigations and one Meta analysis, up to 90% of all suicides involve mental disorders. There is
some information that persons released from mental institutions are at high risk for suicide.
Hence, there is a class of motivated suicidal individuals in geospace around mental hospitals who
can drive up the suicide rate. Some of these may take advantage of the proximity of a mental
hospital to the railway tracks/subway stations to end their lives. The railway is an effective
means for suicide. The authors carefully collect information on all suicides on the rails for
Austria between around railway stations. The total number of suicides on the tracks is 1130. The
total number of miles of tracks is 3,678 miles. The authors note that previous studies on RR
suicides in Germany and the Netherlands did not control for socio-demographic confounders.
These previous studies were largely descriptive (p. 8). Control variables, missing from previous
studies, are introduced foe a wide range of social/economic/demographic factors that have been
found to influence suicide rates. These include unemployment, median income, education level,
age distribution and total suicide rate of the districts surrounding the tracks. Another key control
variable is the number of tracks in an area. Areas of track with multiple lines are related to the
amount of use and number of rail customers in an area, which relate to probabilities for suicide.
The findings of a large number of statistical runs, many involving simulations and checks on
possible errors, determined that there are 15 clusters or hotspots. These RR hotspots accounted
for 111-190 of the RR suicides depending on which assumptions are involved. A key finding was
that the hospital size variable predicted suicide hotspots. This factor exhibited a small to medium
level effect size and the excess risk associated with it ranged from 1.5 to 2.9 (Table 1). Local
population density predicted suicide hotspots. 13/15 hotspots were in districts marked by
relatively high education levels. In contrast, the total suicide rate was inconsistently related to
suicide hot spots, a finding which has been documented before in the mixed findings of previous
work on the subject. The authors validate their model through a series of randomization tests.
2. Critique. The study of suicide hotspots has been a recurrent theme in suicidology with
papers on individual clusters such as those on bridges, national parks, and cliffs. The present
paper adds to the knowledge base by being the first to apply high power mathematical models to
the problem. These models include randomization tests. The paper is actually in a class by itself
compared to previous studies which tend to be based on simple correlational models. By
focusing prevention efforts on hotspots, prevention resources (e.g., budgets for construction of
suicide barriers in subway stations) can lower suicide rates more so than if prevention resources
are randomly distributed in space. The paper is a strong contribution, especially in applying
mathematical models to the issue of suicide clusters. I have never seen such a substantial
application of mathematical principles to suicide rates. There are only a few suggestions that the
author might consider for making an exceptionally strong paper stronger. Perhaps the authors
might consider one or more of the following suggestions. They may not be possible given data
limitations. If so one or more might be listed as a necessary limitation of the analysis. Most
4
suggestions are relatively minor and would take little time. (1) Abstract. The abstract might be
strengthened by adding two phrases describing the scope of suicide and its spatial distribution:
the number of suicides on the Austrian rails over the 12 year period (N=1130 on p. 3) and the
number of miles of track (3,676 miles p 3). (2). Table 1. The last 2 variable comp1 and comp 2
could be clarified by new labels: “socio-demographic Index of principal component 1” and
“socio-demographic principal component 2” – or briefly explained as such in a footnote. Some
readers turn to the tables to get an idea of what an article is about and probably would not know
what comp1 and comp2 mean without first reading the text of the article. (3). Number of
beds/patients in the mental hospitals. The measure of the presence of and size of mental
hospitals/mental illness wings or departments within general hospitals could be strengthened
through clarification (p. 4) or a better defense. It is unclear if the measure “dividing the total bed
count (of a hospital near the tracks) by the respective number of department types” accurately
assesses the variation in the number of actual psychiatric beds in a hospital. This seems like a
measure of the average size of all departments in a hospital. Possibly the authors might explore a
subset of the hospitals that have data on the specific number of psychiatric beds and correlate
that measure with average size of departments. The measure might also be defended in other
ways. For example, it is plausible that persons in non psychiatric departments could be at risk of
suicide. These might include elderly persons diagnosed with debilitating illnesses including
terminal brain cancer or oncoming blindness. Average department size might be related to
suicide hot spots independent of the specific size of the psychiatric department. The analysis
could be rerun with the number of beds in the hospitals as a predictor, but this might require a
substantial amount of work. In any event, some further defense of the measure would strengthen
the paper. Or, the authors might add a sentence to the conclusion stating the limitation of the
measure and calling for future work when data on a better measure become available either in
Austria or another location. That the measure does predict suicide clusters is strength and a good
defense in itself, but the limitation of the measure might be noted. The authors already briefly
note the limitation of their measure in the conclusion, but perhaps an additional sentence there
might be warranted. (4) Suicide barriers. The model, while strong, might have been stronger if
some measure of existing suicide barriers (e.g., walls in subway stations), could have been added.
For example, one or more psychiatric hospitals may be located within a 1 KM of the tracks, and
the tracks contain a highly used subway station, but the subway station might have a high wall
around the tracks. Some stations in some nations have doors that open only when the train has
arrived and stopped. In such stations it is literally impossible to jump in front of the train. Some
discussion in the conclusion might address this limitation and caution future researchers. Some
potential hot spots (perhaps track sections that were formerly hotspots so barriers were built)
near psychiatric facilities may not exist only because of barriers which prevent them. I suggest
that the authors might note that their results may have been stronger if they took existing barrier
locations into account (if there are any such locations with barriers). This would take 1-2
sentences in the conclusion. In general, great job!

<U+F0E0> We thank this reviewer for this positive response which has helped us to
further improve the ms.!
I would recommend acceptance of the ms as it is. There aren only three minor suggestions:
1. In the abstract mention is made of possible traumatisation of train drivers and passengers. I would
plea for the inclusion of another category of potentialy traumatised persons: those who are
responsible for collecting the body parts alongside the track and clean up the mess / train. I have
treated some of these persons for serious PTSD symptoms because of their duties.
<U+F0E0> Thank you for this comment. We were not able to include a further group in
the abstract as this would have further increased the length of the abstract, but
we include this group right in the introduction section of the manuscript (see p.
2 of the full ms.)
2. In the method section something was initially not clear to me: in 2.1. first sentence there is written
that the data on suicides and attempted suicides are collected, and later on that data on attempted
suicides are removed. This was a little bit confusing since from the first reading it appeared that
suicides as well as suicide attemptes were included. Perhaps it would be easier to read if the
collection of data on attempted suicide wasn't mentioned at all, so that the reader only reads texts
and data on suicides. On the other hand, I would be very interested if the authors could also do the
analysis on the combined dataset of suicides and attempted suicides. I would expect the results to be
similar.
<U+F0E0> Thank you for this comment. Have removed all references to suicide attempt
from the data file description as these typically occur in different places,
andoften within station, and would therefore warrant a separate analysis.
3. in section 2.2. Testing the possible influence of psychiatries the word psychiatries is introduced. I
am not a native speaker of English, but I never saw the word psychiatries used for psychiatric
institutions or psychiatric cenres. Is thi correct?
<U+F0E0> We have change the wording to “psychiatric institutions” throughout the
manuscript.

men. The present study assesses the nature of suicide by train (railway suicide) in relation to
clustering effects. If suicide follows geospatial clustering (hotpots), there are implications for
prevention of a portion of suicides. A key focus of the present study is on the proximity of hospitals,
with mental patient departments, to railway stations. According to some investigations and one
Meta analysis, up to 90% of all suicides involve mental disorders. There is some information that
persons released from mental institutions are at high risk for suicide. Hence, there is a class of
motivated suicidal individuals in geospace around mental hospitals who can drive up the suicide rate.
Some of these may take advantage of the proximity of a mental hospital to the railway
tracks/subway stations to end their lives. The railway is an effective means for suicide. The authors
carefully collect information on all suicides on the rails for Austria between around railway stations.
The total number of suicides on the tracks is 1130. The total number of miles of tracks is 3,678 miles.
The authors note that previous studies on RR suicides in Germany and the Netherlands did not
control for socio-demographic confounders. These previous studies were largely descriptive (p. 8).
Control variables, missing from previous studies, are introduced foe a wide range of
social/economic/demographic factors that have been found to influence suicide rates. These include
unemployment, median income, education level, age distribution and total suicide rate of the
districts surrounding the tracks. Another key control variable is the number of tracks in an area.
Areas of track with multiple lines are related to the amount of use and number of rail customers in
an area, which relate to probabilities for suicide. The findings of a large number of statistical runs,
many involving simulations and checks on possible errors, determined that there are 15 clusters or
hotspots. These RR hotspots accounted for 111-190 of the RR suicides depending on which
assumptions are involved. A key finding was that the hospital size variable predicted suicide
hotspots. This factor exhibited a small to medium level effect size and the excess risk associated with
it ranged from 1.5 to 2.9 (Table 1). Local population density predicted suicide hotspots. 13/15
hotspots were in districts marked by relatively high education levels. In contrast, the total suicide
rate was inconsistently related to suicide hot spots, a finding which has been documented before in
the mixed findings of previous work on the subject. The authors validate their model through a series
of randomization tests.
<U+F0E0> We thank this reviewer for this positive response which has helped us to
further improve the ms.!
2. Critique. The study of suicide hotspots has been a recurrent theme in suicidology with papers
on individual clusters such as those on bridges, national parks, and cliffs. The present paper adds to
the knowledge base by being the first to apply high power mathematical models to the problem.
These models include randomization tests. The paper is actually in a class by itself compared to
previous studies which tend to be based on simple correlational models. By focusing prevention
efforts on hotspots, prevention resources (e.g., budgets for construction of suicide barriers in subway
stations) can lower suicide rates more so than if prevention resources are randomly distributed in
space. The paper is a strong contribution, especially in applying mathematical models to the issue of
suicide clusters. I have never seen such a substantial application of mathematical principles to suicide
rates. There are only a few suggestions that the author might consider for making an exceptionally
strong paper stronger. Perhaps the authors might consider one or more of the following suggestions.
They may not be possible given data limitations. If so one or more might be listed as a necessary
limitation of the analysis. Most suggestions are relatively minor and would take little time. (1)
Abstract. The abstract might be strengthened by adding two phrases describing the scope of suicide
and its spatial distribution: the number of suicides on the Austrian rails over the 12 year period
(N=1130 on p. 3) and the number of miles of track (3,676 miles p 3).
<U+F0E0> Thank you for this comment. We have added both numbers in the abstract
(see p.2 of manuscript file).
(2). Table 1. The last 2 variable comp1 and comp 2 could be clarified by new labels: “socio-
demographic Index of principal component 1” and “socio-demographic principal component 2” – or
briefly explained as such in a footnote. Some readers turn to the tables to get an idea of what an
article is about and probably would not know what comp1 and comp2 mean without first reading the
text of the article.
<U+F0E0> We have added the description of these variables in the table legend (see p.
14 of ms.).
(3). Number of beds/patients in the mental hospitals. The measure of the presence of and size of
mental hospitals/mental illness wings or departments within general hospitals could be strengthened
through clarification (p. 4) or a better defense. It is unclear if the measure “dividing the total bed
count (of a hospital near the tracks) by the respective number of department types” accurately
assesses the variation in the number of actual psychiatric beds in a hospital. This seems like a
measure of the average size of all departments in a hospital. Possibly the authors might explore a
subset of the hospitals that have data on the specific number of psychiatric beds and correlate that
measure with average size of departments. The measure might also be defended in other ways. For
example, it is plausible that persons in non psychiatric departments could be at risk of suicide. These
might include elderly persons diagnosed with debilitating illnesses including terminal brain cancer or
oncoming blindness. Average department size might be related to suicide hot spots independent of
the specific size of the psychiatric department. The analysis could be rerun with the number of beds
in the hospitals as a predictor, but this might require a substantial amount of work. In any event,
some further defense of the measure would strengthen the paper. Or, the authors might add a
sentence to the conclusion stating the limitation of the measure and calling for future work when
data on a better measure become available either in Austria or another location. That the measure
does predict suicide clusters is strength and a good defense in itself, but the limitation of the
measure might be noted. The authors already briefly note the limitation of their measure in the
conclusion, but perhaps an additional sentence there might be warranted.
<U+F0E0> Thank you for this comment. We agree that future studies should use more
accurate data on psychiatric department size (which are not available for
Austria for this observation period). On the other hand, average department
type size as calculated in the present study may per se be a risk factor of nearby
railway suicide. We have added a sentence on p.4 to better explain our
approach of how to do the calculation and to point out that this is meant as a
proxy of psychiatric institution size. Further we also, added the thoughts
brought up by this reviewer on p.10 in the limitations section.
(4) Suicide barriers. The model, while strong, might have been stronger if some measure of existing
suicide barriers (e.g., walls in subway stations), could have been added. For example, one or more
psychiatric hospitals may be located within a 1 KM of the tracks, and the tracks contain a highly used
subway station, but the subway station might have a high wall around the tracks. Some stations in
some nations have doors that open only when the train has arrived and stopped. In such stations it is
literally impossible to jump in front of the train. Some discussion in the conclusion might address this
limitation and caution future researchers. Some potential hot spots (perhaps track sections that were
formerly hotspots so barriers were built) near psychiatric facilities may not exist only because of
barriers which prevent them. I suggest that the authors might note that their results may have been
stronger if they took existing barrier locations into account (if there are any such locations with
barriers). This would take 1-2 sentences in the conclusion. In general, great job!
<U+F0E0> Thank you for this comment. We agree that information on existing barriers
would have been valuable for our current model. Unfortunately, related data
were not available. We discuss this thought as a recommendation for future
research in the limitations section of this revised ms (p.14).
