The paper reports using GPU to speed up AIDW interpolation. The research is interesting
especially that GPU is become so popular and AIDW so too. Would suggest a few revisions
before acceptance:
1. The introduction and review should include proper citations, e.g., in the introduction,
statement of the interpolation methods should be cited.
2. How the memory arrangement would impact the results?
3. Would a different GPU make a difference? e.g., bigger cache on GPU?
4. When dividing data into tiles, would the results be the same, i.e., do we need buffer?
5. The results section on comparing AIDW to other methods on GPU is more like a review piece
and should not be included as results of this study.
6. The following book has a comprehensive GPU and GIS process, and may be helpful in
addressing these questions.

This paper proposes and implements a parallel adaptive IDW interpolation algorithm by utilizing
GPU. Comments and suggestions to the authors:
1) Why SoA is better than AoaS? I don’t agree that “the SoA layout can generally make full
use of the memory bandwidth due to no data interleaving”. The data access of IDW interpolation
are usually conducted point by point.
2) From the NVidia website, the processing power of GT 730M between single precision
and double precision is about 24:1. In this paper, “on single precision, the speedup is about 100 ~
400”, and “on double precision, the speedup is only about 8”. What’s the reasons for the ratio
difference? Why the speedup of single precision fluctuate too much? However, single precision is
not enough for scientific computation, e.g. Kriging Interpolation.
3) AIDW need to carry out k-nearest neighbor search all the time. How does the k-nearest
neighbor search on the tile edge for the tiled method?
4) In abstract, “the Structure of Arrays (SoA)” should be AoS
5) All of the abbreviations, when mentioned for the first time, should be spelled out, e.g the

1. The introduction and review should include proper citations, e.g., in the introduction,
statement of the interpolation methods should be cited.
Response 1:
First of all, thank you so much for reviewing our manuscript!
In the section of Introduction, relevant references for the spatial interpolation algorithms
such as IDW, AIDW, Kriging, and DSI have been cited. In addition, some related work on the
parallel spatial interpolation algorithms has also been cited.
Comment 2:
2. How the memory arrangement would impact the results?
Response 2:
The following research work (Peng, Y.H., et al., 2016) gives an excellent explanation to
he above question. So, here we directly present the relevant contents as follows.
Peng, Y.H., et al., Static Cost Estimation for Data Layout Selection on GPUs. Proceedings
of Pmbs 2016: 7th International Workshop on Performance Modeling, Benchmarking and
Simulation of High Performance Computing Systems, 2016: p. 76-86.
Available from: https://doi.org/10.1109/PMBS.2016.13
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following content is directly obtained from the work (Peng, Y.H., et al., 2016).
Currently, the GPU plays an important role in the world of parallel computing. Compared
o multi-core CPUs, GPUs have a larger number of computational cores available and are able
o better handle heavy computational tasks. Unlike on the CPU, memory transactions are
performed at the granularity of warps on the GPU, where every warp consists of a set of
adjacent threads. If the threads inside a warp are accessing nearby memory locations, then the
memory requests from multiple threads may be satisfiable by a single memory transaction.
The technique of combining memory accesses in adjacent threads into fewer memory
ransactions is called memory coalescing [1]. Thus, compared to the CPU, a poor memory
access pattern can lead to greater performance loss on the GPU.
The data layout of an application refers to the manner in which data is stored and
organized. Due to the high global memory access latency relative to the latency of arithmetic
operations, the choice of data layout can significantly affect the efficiency of execution on the
GPU. Moreover, as a result of the unique architectural features of the GPU, the best data
ayout on the GPU is usually different from the best data layout on the CPU. For instance, in
old GPU models before the L1 and L2 cache were introduced, Structof-Array (SoA) would
usually be preferred since it would achieve better coalescing of memory access. In contrast,
on the CPU, using Array-of-Struct (AoS) would be more efficient in general, because using
AoS would encourage spatial locality. However, modern GPU models have enabled on-chip
L1 cache and off-chip L2 cache. For example, the Fermi GPU has 64KB configurable shared
memory and L1 cache, as well as 768KB unified L2 cache [2]. Later models like Kepler and
Maxwell further enlarge the size of the L1 and L2 cache [3] [4]. The GPU L1 and L2 cache
brought back the opportunity of cache reuse, which means merging fields stored in discrete
arrays in SoA into a single AoS might lead to better performance. As a result, the best data
ayout might be represented in the form of Struct-of-Arrayof-Struct (SoAoS), a hybridization
of AoS and SoA.

Comment 3:
3. Would a different GPU make a difference? e.g., bigger cache on GPU?
Response 3:
Yes, a different GPU probably makes a difference. Because the impact of the data layouts
on the computational efficiency is strongly determined by the architecture of the GPU, for
example, the different generations of GPUs.
As suggested by the reviewers, we have conducted additional experimental results on
another two GPUs, i.e., Quadro M5000 and Tesla K40c. So, in the Section of Results, the
experimental tests are carried out on three different GPUs.
The specifications of the adopted GPUs are listed as follows. Moreover, this table is also
presented in the Results section.

Comment 4:
4. When dividing data into tiles, would the results be the same, i.e., do we need buffer?
Response 4:
Yes, the results definitely would be the same when dividing the data into tiles. The reason
and motivation why to divide data into tiles are that: the shared memory is inherently quite
aster than the global memory on the GPU. To improve the computational efficiency, it is
preferred to replace the use of global memory with the use of shared memory.
However, the size of the input and output data is usually quite large, which is originally
stored in the CPU memory and then transferred into the GPU global memory. To replace the
global memory access with shared memory access, it is better to further transfer the large size
of data on the GPU global memory to the GPU shared memory.
But, the size of the shared memory per block is quite limited. The data on global memory
cannot directly mapped into the shared memory. Thus, for a big size of data, it is needed to
irst divide the data on the global memory into a set of tiles, and then transfer each tile of data
nto the shared memory. After the use of each tile of data, the next tile would be subsequently
ransferred until all the data is used. In this procedure, the buffer is generally needed.
Comment 5:

Comment 4:
(4) pay attention to some typos, such as AoS and SoA?
Response 4:
When designing and implementing the parallel AIDW algorithm on the GPU, we have
considered the data layouts SoA, AoS, and AoaS.
Typically, there are two major choices of the data layout: the Array of Structures (AoS)
and the Structure of Arrays (SoA) [8]; another type of data layout, Array of aligned Structures
AoaS) [29], can be very easily generated by adding the forced alignment based upon the
ayout AoS. In fact, the data layout AoaS can be considered as an improved variant of the
ayout AoS; see these three layouts, i.e., SoA, AoS, and AoaS in Figure 2.
In practice, it is not always obvious which data layout will achieve better performance for a
specific GPU application. A common solution is to implement a specific application using
different data layouts separately and then compare the performance.
As mentioned above, the data layout AoaS can be considered as an improved variant of the
ayout AoS; and it has been reported that: the data layout AoaS can achieve better efficiency
han that by the layout AoS [29].
So, in this work, we have specifically evaluated the performance impact of the two data
ayouts, SoA and AoaS.

float x[N]; float x;

This paper proposes and implements a parallel adaptive IDW interpolation algorithm by
utilizing GPU. Comments and suggestions to the authors:
1) Why SoA is better than AoaS? I don’t agree that “the SoA layout can generally make
ull use of the memory bandwidth due to no data interleaving”. The data access of IDW
nterpolation are usually conducted point by point.
2) From the NVidia website, the processing power of GT 730M between single precision
and double precision is about 24:1. In this paper, “on single precision, the speedup is about
100 ~ 400”, and “on double precision, the speedup is only about 8”. What’s the reasons for
he ratio difference? Why the speedup of single precision fluctuate too much? However,
single precision is not enough for scientific computation, e.g. Kriging Interpolation.
3) AIDW need to carry out k-nearest neighbor search all the time. How does the k-nearest
neighbor search on the tile edge for the tiled method?
4) In abstract, “the Structure of Arrays (SoA)” should be AoS
5) All of the abbreviations, when mentioned for the first time, should be spelled out, e.g
he tiled version and the CDP version, in P3L53.

Response 1:
First, thank you so much for reviewing our manuscript. For the above problem. We would
ike to give a little detailed explanation. The explanation is also presented in “5. Discussion,
a) Impact of Data Layout on the Computational Efficiency”; see the screenshot.
In this work, we have implemented the naive version and the tiled version with the use of
wo data layouts SoA and AoaS. In our experimental tests, we have found that: on single
precision, the SoA data layout can achieve a little better efficiency than the AoaS on the GPU
GT730M, while the data layout AoaS is slightly better than the SoA on both of GPUs M5000
and K40c. However, there is no significant difference in the efficiency when using the above
wo data layouts on the adopted three GPUs; see Figure 7.
Each type of data layouts has its theoretical advantages. Theoretically, organizing data in
SoA layout can generally make full use of the memory bandwidth due to no data interleaving
8]. In addition, global memory accesses based upon the SoA layout are always coalesced. In
contrast, when employing the layout AoaS, the data structure for representing multi-valued
data such as a set of 3D points is forced to be aligned; see Figure 2. Operations using the
aligned structure would require much fewer memory transactions when accessing global
memory, and thus increase the overall efficiency performance [30].
In practice, the impact of data layouts on the computational efficiency strongly depends on:
1) the particular problem that needs to be solved; and (2) the GPUs used to deal with the
arget problem.
In this work, the experimental tests indicate that: on single precision, the SoA data layout
can achieve a little better efficiency than the AoaS on the GPU GT730M, while the data
ayout AoaS is slightly better than the SoA on both of GPUs M5000 and K40c. The reason for
he above behavior is probably that: for the same specific application, the impact of data
ayouts on the computational efficiency may differ on different GPUs.
Although the two data layouts lead to different impacts on the computational efficiency,
here is no significant difference in the efficiency when using the above two data layouts on
he adopted three GPUs; see Figure 7. This is probably because that: the AIDW interpolation
algorithm is quite suitable to be parallelized on the GPU, and the parallelization has been well
mplemented. Therefore, the impact of different data layouts on the efficiency for a specific
highly parallelized application would be not significant.
As a summary, the impact of data layouts on the computational efficiency may differ on
different GPUs. It also should be noted that: it is not always obvious which data layout will
achieve better performance for a specific application.
Comment 2:
2) From the NVidia website, the processing power of GT 730M between single precision
and double precision is about 24:1. In this paper, “on single precision, the speedup is about
100 ~ 400”, and “on double precision, the speedup is only about 8”. What’s the reasons for
he ratio difference? Why the speedup of single precision fluctuate too much? However,
single precision is not enough for scientific computation, e.g. Kriging Interpolation.
Response 2:
In my opinion, the processing power of GT 730M between single precision and double
precision is about 24:1 theoretically. In practice, the processing power of GT730M in double
precision over the corresponding power in single precision would be quite different, i.e.,
higher than 24:1, for example 30: 1 or even 40:1.
This is because that: the processing power of the same GPU, for example, GT730M, is
strongly dependent on the specific problem that is to be solved. More specifically, for a
specific problem to be dealt with, the processing power of the same GPU strongly depends on
he underlying algorithm and even the implementation of the algorithm.
This is also the reason why there is a significant ratio difference.
Single precision is enough for some of the scientific computations, for example, the
geological modeling. This is because that in many applications in Geoscience, the obtained /
nput data to be processed is not so accurate by itself. In this case, the requirement to be
highly accurately using double precision is not needed; and the single precision in this case is
enough.
However, the double precision is needed to be preferred in most scientific computation.
For example, in most of the numerical simulations, the double precision should be used to
mprove the accuracy of the numerical results.
But, it should be noted that on GPUs, the computations on double precision is inherently
much slower than that on single precision. So, there would be a trade-off between the
computational efficiency and the accuracy. The double precision should be preferred if high
accuracy is required, while the single precision can be used to achieve high computational
efficiency.
When accelerating the IDW and AIDW algorithms on the GPU, single precision is enough.
n the Kriging interpolation, it is needed to first form a coefficient matrix and then inverse the
matrix. To make the coefficient matrix invertible, it is better to generate the matrix on double
precision. In fact, in this procedure, the single precision can also be used, but it would
probably make the coefficient matrix unable to inverse.
In the year 2011, I wrote a book on the topic of geological modeling, including various
spatial interpolation algorithm, for example, the IDW, DSI, Kriging. When I prepared the
source code for the book, I also found the above-mentioned problem.
In summary, in my opinion, the significant difference between the processing power of the
same GPU on single precision and on double precision is reasonable.
Comment 3:
3) AIDW need to carry out k-nearest neighbor search all the time. How does the k-nearest
neighbor search on the tile edge for the tiled method?
Response 3:
Yes, one of the key steps in the AIDW interpolation algorithm is to find k-nearest data
points for each interpolated / prediction point. In the tiled version, the procedure of the kNN
search is as follows.
For each interpolated point, termed as ipt, we need to find the k nearest data points for the
point ipt. For example, we can set k as 10. And of course, we can set k as other values, e.g.,
20. Assume k = 10, now we need to find the nearest 10 data points for the prediction point ipt.
The most straightforward method is to first calculate the distance between each data point
and the prediction point ipt, and then sort all the distances ascending. After that, the 10
nearest data points can be found.
However, in the tiled method, all of the data points cannot be stored in the shared memory.
t can probably only be stored in the global memory. To improve the computational efficacy,
he shared memory needs to be exploited.
So, we first divide the set of all input data points into several smaller sizes of data points.
Each small set of the data points is in fact a “tile”, which can be stored in the shared memory.
This procedure is referred to as “tiling”.
We first find the 10 nearest data points in the first tile and record the corresponding points
ndices and distances, and assume the first wave of 10 nearest data points as the required 10
nearest points temporarily. Then, we map the second “tile” of data points from the global
memory to the shared memory, calculate the distances, and update the current wave of 10
nearest data points according to the distances calculated from the second tile of data points.
After that, the 10 nearest data points first obtained from the first “tile” has been updated
according to the distances calculated from the second tile of data points. Subsequently, we
map the next tile of data points from the global memory to the shared memory, calculate the
distances, and the re-update the current 10 nearest data points according to the distances. after
ooping over all “tiles” of data points, the final 10 nearest data points can be found.
