This paper contains data that are highly interesting to the primatology and anthropology
communities and should therefore certainly be made available by publication. The text can be
improved in several ways, however. Here are a few suggestions and remarks (in the order of
appearance in the Ms rather than importance):
16 I am no expert, but I don’t think champ males only run down their prey. They also corner
them, find them while hiding etc.
17 The fact that the hypothesis (where does it come from? reference?) doesn't hold for one
population doesn't mean it doesn't hold for 'chimpanzees' in general and it certainly doesn't say
anything about other sub-species and other environments, as the author remarks herself a few
lines down: 22 'in certain contexts'). I suggest to present this as a fact of life, based on solid data
from other sites, rather than a ‘hypothesis’.
18 (but also elsewhere) There also is not 'a priori reason to assume that chimps have a category
"vertebrates" or that this is an ecologically relevant category in their diet. What is relevant is
“source of proteins” or something similar. Other sources of proteins, notably ants and termites,
are being obtained by using tools in other populations too. Is there indeed a principal difference
between eusocial insect fishing and stabbing small mammals? Both are hidden in tree-trunks etc.
and both require tools that are both made for this purpose and both yield protein-rich food.
32 Humans tend to have central camps from which men tend to stray much further than women
for all kinds of reasons. This might prevent hunting by women as much as any other constraint.
The question is what came first: the central camps or the sex-biased hunting behaviour? This is a
difference that a priori doesn’t apply to chimps. The crucial difference between humans and
chimps might be having or not having a central camp and the sex-biased foraging (hunting)
behaviour might be a secondary effect.
38 “and contextualize their behavior via a relational type of analogous model”. I can only say
“WOW” – what an impressive sentence! If only I would understand what it means ...
RESULTS – A rather important chunk of information missing here is data on hunting prey other
than galagos. One has to eat quite a few galagos in order to make up for some of the monkeys
mentioned in 143-144. I get the impression that adult males are the more proficient hunters of this
kind of prey – and this would explain, as the author also suggests in the Discussion, that these
males are therefore less interested in galago-stabbing. To put this in a proper context, however,
the reader would need some hard numbers and good estimates of total quantities of meat
obtained by one or the other age-sex class. Reading the Ms one gets the impression that the
message intended is something like: “in this population the adolescents are much smarter than
those big males as is evident from their tool-assisted hunting”. But the real message may well be:
“in this population the adolescents (and to a lesser extent the females) have found an interesting
alternative to forms of hunting they are less capable of – something that these age-sex classes
don’t do in other populations (but maybe they do more eusocial insect fishing??)”. Without a
complete picture of all animal prey foraging the story makes little sense to me. With it, the paper
would make a very valuable contribution to the literature.

This paper presents new and interesting data on the frequency of tool assisted hunting of galagos
in holes by chimpanzees in Fongoli. It shows that adolescent males and females and juvenile
females hunted more than expected, and adult males less than expected based on observation
time. However, most of these hunts were unsuccessful. It would be interesting to calculate the
rate of successful tool assisted hunts for the different age-sex classes. The paper seems rather
hurriedly written. In many places the references are sparse or lacking, or incorrectly quoted.
Some sentences in the abstract are not corroborated in the text. There are also issues with framing
and emphasis.
At the moment the paper frames these results by suggesting that they refute the “hypothesis”
that hunting is a male activity in chimpanzees. A more straightforward framing would be to put
the data more firmly in the context of different kinds of prey hunted by chimpanzees in different
ways by different age-sex classes. It is mentioned that chimps at Fongoli also capture larger
primates, but no detail is given on which age –sex classes make these captures except in
parentheses in the last sentence of the paper where the hunters are said to be mostly males. The
difference between this population and others appears to be primarily in the frequency in which
chimps attempt to capture galagos with sticks. Although their success rate is very low, this
activity appears to be much more common than at other sites (although stick poking in holes has
been observed at other sites). Such hunting by immatures is perhaps analogous to the capture of
birds and eggs by these age classes at other sites. The argument that these age-sex classes spend
more effort on a low return activity because it is less risky or energetically costly than capturing
large prey is reasonable.
Detailed comments
ABSTRACT
Line 26-27: no mention of this point in the text.
INTRO
First paragraph could use more detailed references
Line 34: ref 5 is not the correct reference?
Line 35-6: ref 2 does not mention hominins.
Line 38: not clear what this means
Line 58-9: It would be very useful to give a definition of a hunt. It seems that in this paper only
hunts with tools are being considered.
4
Line 70: Define hunting bout.
Line 72 Do you mean “Cases where individuals HAD POSSESSION OF a Galago but were not
observed TO CAPTURE IT were not….”?
Line 73-4: The number of cases where they chased down prey would be interesting to report.
Which age-sex classes did this?
RESULTS: Need to incorporate references to the figures!!
Line 87-90: This passage needs punctuation and a verb.
DISCUSSION
Line 118: More references than (7) would be useful.
Line 133-135: Inclusion of these data in the in prep. paper in the current paper would be helpful.
Line 137 – ref (2) does not seem correct.
Line 139-140: Is this really unexpected? You are comparing this kind of hunting to completely
different kinds of hunting at other sites.
Line 141-144: the argument in not clear.
Line 154-156: Give references for these statements.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The paper became much better balanced and provides much more valuable information by the
inclusion of overall hunting data and a more interesting data analysis. In that respect the paper
seems now ready for publication. I was taken aback, however, by the sloppy writing, notably of
the Introduction (I must admit I got a bit tired of close reading and detailed commenting after
that too).
The writing style is rather indirect. The authors try keeping the reader in suspense, apparently.
This is OK for fiction, bit in scientific texts a straightforward dry form of writing that maximizes
information and minimizes words is usually more appreciated. The Abstract is a good example of
this, although especially there the info/length ratio should have been optimized.
More detailed comments:
The line numbering method is rather clumsy, making detailed commenting a bit laborious. I may
have made errors in the page numbers below.
The paper’s title could be more straightforward and informative by mentioning Galago stabbing.
Whether or not that is unusual is up to the reader to decide (I think most of us would indeed
consider it unusual).
Page 6
21 If bush babies are the only victims, then replace ‘vertebrate prey’ by Galago.
21/22 Odd sentence. Better? “making them an important source of inspiration for hypotheses of
early hominin hunting behaviour based on analogies”
23 Odd hypothesis. It would be highly surprising if all age-sex classes showed the same hunting
behaviour (in quality and frequency) (see also 50-52). I would suggest testing the hypothesis that
the distribution of tool-assisted hunting over age-sex classes differs considerably from other
forms of hunting (that are also observed at other sites). Formulating this – or any other
hypothesis – is problematic, however, since it is obviously a post-hoc affair.
30 ‘less often than expected” Expectation based on what?
7
46 ‘over the long term’ = over extended periods of time
54 ‘contribute to calories’??
Page 7
3 ‘men are predominant hunters’. Is this supposed to mean that they hunt more than women or
that they spend most of their foraging time hunting?
3 What kind of models are these? Verbal, game-theoretical, economical ...
7/8 what could be ‘superficial’ about it? In the sense that there are analogies rather than
homologies??
16 ‘look to’ = look at?
18 What ‘other types of evidence’ Dolphins? Hyenas? Or what?
34 What happens here? One hypothesis informs the other? Where is that supposed to end? At
which level are predictions formulated that are being tested? (and how?)
35ff A woolly way of saying that the ‘unique humans’ camp is forced to keep shifting the gaol
posts. In fact most of the Introduction is rather woolly. The authors keep suggesting ‘hypotheses’
without clearly formulating any. The only hypothesis I can recognize is that there are ‘sex
differences’. Can one be vaguer than that?
Page 8
3 WHAT? This hunting behaviour is “characterised” by sex differences? That is like saying the
driving cars is .... I guess one better characterises by the type of tools used, the frequency, the
season, the time of day, the kind of trees etc. etc.
Page 9
23 ‘most were in the study group’ – were where the (few) others then?
45 For me ‘aggression’ is an intra-specific behaviour. The rest is either predation or defence.
Page 14 25 Should be ‘less likely to hunt USING TOOLS’?’
P 15 43 Should be ’99 hunting cases OTHER THAN TOOL-ASSSITED GALAGO HUNTING?
P 16 38 ‘appeared to have been adults’
P19 34 ‘at least one other site, Mahale,’ is a bit more informative.
41 can then become ‘this site’

This is a considerably improved paper now that data on hunting of other vertebrates is
incorporated. However, there are still many problems in the description of the data and analysis.
The methods section is extremely confusing because the terms are not well defined. This lack of
precision makes it extremely difficult to work out what is being measured. Sometimes hunt
means capture, but in the case of Galagos “hunting bouts” can include unsuccessful hunting
attempts. The methods should be completely re-written to explain the different methodology
that is applied to describing non-Galago hunts and Galago, tool- assisted hunts. It needs to be
clarified that for non-Galago prey, no attempt was made to measure hunting attempts, and data
are only presented on captures. In contrast, for tool-assisted hunting, unsuccessful hunting bouts
are also recorded. In the results I would suggest starting with the general patterns of hunting
observed at Fongoli (Fig 2) and then describe the more detailed analysis of tool-assisted hunting
attempts. See detailed comments:
P8:lines12-16 Not clear what this sentence means
P9:3010 Clarify whether “hunting days” include all hunting or just tool-assisted hunting.
P9: 34 What is a”hunting bout” - just tool-assisted?
P9:50-51 “hunting bouts” here seem to refer only to successful capture? Notes that many papers
on hunting include hunting attempts, whether successful or not (e.g. Gilby et al. ANIMAL
BEHAVIOUR, 2008, 75, 351-360).
P10:45 These numbers don’t add up. You specify 4 cases but then describe 5….
P11:52 what is hunting probability? Just for tool-assisted?
P12:16 what kind of hunting bouts are these 238? All tool-assisted?
P12:28 “hunting success” has not been defined.
Results: Better to reverse the order of presentation (and also in the Methods). Deal with general
patterns of hunting on all vertebrate prey first and then tool-assisted, second.
P13:30-32 Have you defined hunting day?
P14: 43. Have you defined what you mean by a ‘hunting case’ previously?
P15:41-43 What do you mean by a successful hunter? What is your metric? Hunts per
observation day?
P15:41-50 – how about presenting individual hunting data as a table?
P16:12-14 Awkward way of expressing the pattern
P17:5-7 check this sentence
9
P15:3-17 Hard to understand this passage
P17:3-43 At East African sites females are often alone and not subject to the risk of theft, so this
argument is not sufficient. I suppose there are no data on the density of Galagos or the structure
of their habitats (tree holes, etc.) at different sites?
Fig 5. The legend needs more explanation. Are these data corrected for time each sex is
observed? Do you need to include ref 42?
