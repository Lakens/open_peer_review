The original version of this manuscript was submitted to Interface. During that review, I felt that
the paper read more like a review article than it did like a presentation of new findings. The
authors have improved some upon this by the additions that they have made to the manuscript.
However, I feel that it would be helpful for the readers if the authors would state specifically in
the Abstract what is new. In addition, they should clearly state in each section what is new and
how it fits in with the previous findings. In addition, I have some points in regard to the changes
made to text and the Response to the Reviewers. These are mostly semantic, but I raise them for
clarity.
1. The authors claim that "Recognizing that the characteristic force in the definition of the Peclet
number has shaped the evolution of T. majus is new information." However, the definition of the
Peclet number that is used here is somewhat comparable to the definition given in the cited work
by Cogan and Wolgemuth (ref. 20), as well as an earlier paper by Cogan and Wolgemuth
("Pattern formation by bacteria-driven flow", Biophys. J. 88: 2525-2529 (2005), which should also
be cited). Wolgemuth and Cogan define a Peclet number that depends on the diffusion of the
3
bacteria and the height of the veil, as opposed to the diffusion of oxygen. However, both
definitions of the Peclet number depend in the same way on the force from the bacteria. Both of
these papers come to the conclusion that the Peclet number is the parameter that drives the
pattern formation. Since the bacterial force is the parameter that can be controlled by evolution, it
is somewhat questionable to claim that this realization is new. The authors should consider
mentioning this other definition of the Peclet number. It would seem likely that this other
definition is more applicable to the pattern formation, since it depends on the number of bacteria
and the height of the veil, both of which influence the fluid flows.
2. The authors have added a statement to the revised manuscript that "One additional effect may
influence distribution of cells after the formation of dimples. As proposed Cogan & Wolgemuth
[20], free-swimming cells are advected by the flow generated by cells attached to the veil. This
effect becomes important relative to chemotaxis when the flow generated by the veil becomes of
order the swimming speed. Thus, this phenomenon may influence the final distribution of cells,
but it is of secondary importance in the initiation of density fluctuations." The authors, though,
have not shown that chemotaxis parallel to the veil is required for pattern formation. Therefore,
the claim that flow-driven aggregation is a secondary effect is not accurate.

Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5
5) Included your supplementary files in a format you are happy with (no line numbers,
vancouver referencing, track changes removed etc) as these files will NOT be edited in
production
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.
Best wishes

Comments to the Author:
Your paper has now been refereed by two experts and both feel that it is worthy of publication.
One referee would like to see some changes and so I would ask for a revised version of the paper
that considers these points.

Keywords: convergent evolution, hydrodynamics, collective dynamics
Abstract: Microbes living in stagnant water typically rely on chemical diffusion to draw nutrients
from their environment. The sulfur-oxidizing bacterium Thiovulum majus~and the ciliate
Uronemella have independently evolved the ability to form a ``veil,'' a centimeter-scale mucous
sheet on which cells organize to produce a macroscopic flow. This flow pulls nutrients through
the community an order of magnitude faster than diffusion. To understand how natural selection
led these microbes to evolve this collective behavior, we connect the physical limitations acting
on individual cells to the collective dynamics of communities. We show how diffusion limitation
and viscous dissipation have led individual T. majus and Uronemella~cells to display two similar
characteristics. Both of these cells exert a force of 40 pN on the water and attach to boundaries by
means of a mucous stalk. We then show how these traits combined with chemotaxis lead
communities to cooperate to stir their environment. These results show that veil formation does
not require specialized adaptations to coordinate the individual behaviors of microbes. We
conclude that this convergent evolution is a reflection of similar physical limitations imposed by
diffusion and viscosity acting on individual cells.
