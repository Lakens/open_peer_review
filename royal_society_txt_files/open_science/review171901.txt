This manuscript documents facultative parthenogenesis in two species of elapid snakes. The analysis
appears to be well-done, and my only criticisms are (1) insufficient attention to detail in the text, with
too many typographical errors; and (2) there are no data from broods of these species produced NON-
parthenogentically, which would have been a better comparison than the current one (in which the
putative father, plus the mother, are the only sexually-produced individuals included).

when we are discussing parthenogens! Surely it should be “putative father”, as in the Table?

With the evidence growing that facultative parthenogenesis is phylogenetically widespread in snakes
and occurs in the wild, exploring potential cases of facultative parthenogenesis in groups for which
data was previously lacking will augment our understanding of commonalities and variability across
the snake phylogeny. Here, the authors provide convincing evidence of facultative parthenogenesis in
the Elapidae, a group lacking such information. The data are robust and paint a picture comparable to
that previously reported by Booth & Schuett (2011, 2016), with parthenogenesis producing few male-
only offspring, exhibiting reduced viability in some instances, and excessive homozygosity. One point
that should be addressed is the health of the Taipan parthenogens and the live Death adders. Are they

still alive? How was sex confirmed? See Schuett et al. (1997) for evidence of misidentify the sex of a
parthenogen due to genital deformaties. Visualization of the gonads through surgery, as used in Booth
et al. 2011(a and b), or screening for sex chromosomes either through karyotyping of RADseq, is
advised. Additionally, I failed to find any information regarding the number of SNPs for each species.
Consider adding these to Table 2. I would like to see this addressed prior to publication, as it provides
more roust evidence of facultative parthenogenesis in snakes.

Fields et al report the presence of free-living facultative parthenogens. However, Booth et al. (2014)
(Biological Journal of the Linnean Society) suggest that second generation parthenogenesis is the likely
cause of the genetically identical Burmese pythons, originally reported by Groot et al. (2004) and
attributed to automixis or premeiotic doubling.

Abstract
Parthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction by which embryos develop from
unfertilized eggs. Parthenogenesis occurs in reptilereptiles, however is not yet known to
occur in the widespread elapid snakes (Elapidae), which include well-known taxa such as
cobras, mambas, taipans and sea snakes. Here, we describe the production of viable
parthenogens in two species of Australo-Papuan elapids with divergent reproductive modes:
the oviparous Coastal/Papuan Taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus) and the viviparous Southern
Death Adder (Acanthophis antarcticus). Analyses of nuclear SNP data excluded paternity for
putative fathers and convincingly demonstrated asexual reproduction, thus representing the
first evidence of facultative parthenogenesis in Elapidae. Our finding has broad implications
for understanding the evolution of reproductive diversity in snakes, as well as managing the
conservation of genetic diversity in wild and captive populations.

1. Introduction
Parthenogenesis is an asexual mode of reproduction by which embryos develop from
unfertilized eggs. The importance of this reproductive mode in vertebrates is now widely
recognized, with observations of parthenogenesis in several groupsclass, including reptiles
(Avise 2008). In snakes, there is evidence of two naturally occurring modes of asexual
reproduction. Obligatory parthenogenesis (OP) is found in exclusively parthenogenic species
such as the Brahminy Blind Snake (Indotyphlops braminus) which have all-female
populations (Cogger 2014). Facultative parthenogenesis (FP) appears to be more common
and is found in snakes that reproduce sexually as well as asexually and thus have male/female
populations (Booth & Schuett 2015). FP in vertebrates was considered anProduction of male-
only or female-only parthenogens is a result of different sex chromosome systems, with
advanced snakes exhibiting ZW (female heterogamety), and basal snakes appearing to exhibit
XY (male heterogamety) (Gamble et al. 2017). FP in vertebrates was considered a probable
artefact of captivity until evidence was reported from wild populations, including two species
of pitviper snakes (Viperidae) (Booth et al., 2012). A second generation of parthenogens has
also been confirmed in two vertebrates (wild Smalltooth Sawfish: Fields et al 2015; and
another vertebrate (captive White Spotted Bamboo shark: Straube at al 2015), but isthis has
yet to be reported in snakes.
The process of FP occurs via ‘automixis’ and is attributed to terminal fusion, whereby
the egg nucleus fuses with a second polar body and diploidy is restored (Lampert 2008).
However, Booth & Schuett (2015) note that without confirmation of heterozygosity, gamete
duplication in unfertilised eggs cannot be rejected as an alternative mechanism of
parthenogen production. Records of FP in ‘advanced’ snakes (caenophidians + colubroids)
indicate that fertility rates of litters/clutches containing parthenogens are low, often contain
stillborns, and only male parthenogenetic offspring are produced (Schuett et al, 1997; Booth
& Schuett, 2011, 2015). In contrast, basal alethinophidians (Boidae and Pythonidae) produce
only female parthenogens. In both cases, the progeny are half clones of the mother. Despite a
growing list of snake taxa for which we have genetic confirmation of FP (see Booth &
Schuett 2015) none have been reported from the widespread and species rich Elapidae, which
includes well-known medically significant species such as cobras, mambas, taipans and sea
snakes.
Here, we present genetic evidence of FP in two species of elapids with different
reproductive modes: the oviparous Papuan/Coastal Taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus) and
viviparous Southern Death Adder (Acanthophis antarcticus). The reproductive accounts
resulting in parthenogens were noteworthy to us as they were inconsistent with atypical to our
previous reproductive record for the species (see supplementary information female snake
reproductive history). Greer (1997) reviewed data from reproductive accounts of the elapids
summarizing the southern death adder produces mean 17.6 (n = 80) neonates, and the taipan
produces mean 14 (n = 67). The taipan also has the ability to reproduce from stored sperm
within a reproductive season (Barnett 86, Banks 83b, Allen in press). Both species are large
bodied, highly venomous,followed characteristics outlined by Booth & Schuett (2011, 2016).
Females had not been in contact with males for extended periods, fertility rates of
clutches/litters were very low (Table 1), all resulting offspring were male and medically
significant.some stillborn/developmental abnormalities were evident.
The Coastal/Papuan Taipan occurs in sub-tropical to tropical coastal regions of
Australia and southern PNG. The Southern Death Adder occurs in temperate to tropical
regions of southern and eastern Australia. Both species are large bodied, highly venomous,
and medically significant. Reviewed data from published reproductive accounts of the elapids
shows the southern death adder produces mean 17.6 (n = 80) neonates and the taipan Formatted: Font: Italic

produces mean 14 (n = 67) (Greer, 1997). The taipan is also known to reproduce from stored Formatted: Font: Italic

sperm (Barnett 86, Banks 83b). Taipans from PNG were long considered a subspecies of the
coastal taipan after SlatterSlater (1956) but have since been shown to be synonymous
(Wüster et al, 2005). GivenAlthough now synonymous given the significance of geographic

We used double-digest Restriction site Associated DNA (ddRAD-seq) nuclear SNP
markers to genotype reproductive females, their offspring and captive males that potentially
sired these offspring. Our findings represent the first molecular verification of FP in the
Elapidae and thus extend the current knowledge of FP in snakes.

Snake maintenance and reproduction breeding
Female #1 wasand #2 were multi-generation captive Coastal Taipan bred raised at our
facility andwhereas female #23 was a Papuan Taipan wild collected as an adult from Saibai
Island in the Torres Strait. The female Southern Death Adder was wild collected from the
Eyre Peninsula, South Australia. Snakes were maintained individually with a thermostatically
controlled heat source which provides a temperature gradient allowing for thermoregulation.
Death Adders were exposed to a simulatedthermal seasonal shift where the heat source was
reduced gradually over the cooler months and slowly raised leading into warmer months.
simulating natural temperate environments. At appropriate times of year, male snakes were
introduced to female enclosures for 1-5 day periods for potential mating. Females were
noticeably gravid when they became larger in their posterior region, restless and refused food
late in gestation. The neonates of the

Genotyping and analyses
Tissue samples from adults and offspring were collected, and DNA was extracted
using a ‘salting-out’ method (Nicholls et al. 2000) and the extracts quantified using the
Quantus Fluorometer (Promega) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Double-digest
Restriction Associated DNA (ddRAD-seq) libraries were made in batches of 96 including a
library blank control following the protocol of Poland et al. (2012) with some modifications.
Two hundred nanograms of DNA was digested at 37°C for 2 hours using 8 U of PstI (six-
base recognition site, CTGCAG) and HpaII (four-base recognition site, CCGG) in 20 µL of
1x CutSmart Buffer (New England Biosciences [NEB]).

temperature for two hours, and then heat killed at 65°C for 20 minutes. Ligation products
were pooled into four pools of 24 samples each. Pooled libraries were purified using the
QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and eluted in 120 µL of EB buffer (Qiagen).
PCR reactions to add the full-length Illumina adapters (Poland et al., 2012) were
performed in eight replicates per library pool in 30 µL volumes containing 10 µL of purified
library, 1x Hot Start Taq Master Mix (NEB), and 0.66 µM each of the forward and reverse
primers. The PCR conditions were: 95° C for 30 seconds, 16 cycles of 95° C for 30 seconds,
65° C for 20 seconds, and 68° C for 30 seconds, followed by 68° C for 5 minutes, and 25° C
for 1 minute. The eight replicates per library were re-pooled and purified as above, eluting in
30 µL of EB buffer (Qiagen). We then used a two-step double-SPRI protocol (Lennon et al.
2010) to pool all four of the libraries and to select for fragments between 100 and 300 bp
using a homemade SPRI bead mix (Rohland and Reich, 2012). Pooled libraries were
sequenced in 1x75 bp (single-end) high output reactions on the Illumina Next-seq at the
Australian Genome Research Facility, Adelaide.
Sequence Processing
We used STACKS v1.47 pipeline (Catchen et al., 2013, 2011) to process the sequence
data for each species separately, employing parameters previously identified as maximising
matching SNP calls and minimising mismatching SNP calls between sample replicates. Raw
sequencing reads were de-multiplexed using GBSX (Herten et al. 2015). These
demultiplexed reads were chastity filtered, had regions with quality < Q10 trimmed from
either end of the read, had cut-sites removed, had adapters removed (allowing for one
mismatch) and truncated to 57 bp using the BBTools modules (bbduk.sh and bbduk2.sh;
Bushnell 2015). Samples with more than 500,000 reads per sample were considered well
sequenced and continued in the analysis. RAD loci were identified for each sample using the
ustacks module, requiring a minimum stack read depth of five (m=5) and a maximum of one
nucleotide mismatches (M=1) between stacks at a locus. Loci with more than 50 stacks
(mls=50) and more reads than two standard deviations above the mean were filtered as they
may map to multiple points on the genome. A ‘deleveraging algorithm’ was used to try to
resolve over-merged loci. A catalogue of consensus loci among individuals for each species
was constructed with the cstacks module using the ustacks output files. Loci were recognized
as homologous across individuals if they mismatched at four or fewer bases (n=5). Alleles
were identified in each individual against this catalogue using the module sstacks. The
module populations, was used to remove potential homologs by filtering out loci with
heterozygosity > 0.8. Loci with a minimum minor allele frequency < 0.05 were filtered out,
as were loci not sequenced in all samples within a species and the resulting SNP datasets
were output to a PLINK format file (i.e. ped and map files).
The R package Rhh (Alho et al. 2010) was used to test three measures of individual
multilocus heterozygosity: internal relatedness (IR; Amos et al. 2001), standardized
heterozygosity (SH; Coltman et al. 1999), and homozygosity by loci (HL; Aparicio et al.
2006). Internal relatedness can be used to infer inbreeding from multilocus heterozygosity
data using allele frequencies, however it underestimates heterozygosity of individuals
carrying rare alleles. Therefore, homozygosity by loci (HL) is also used as it weighs the
contribution of each locus to the homozygosity index depending on their allelic variability.
Standardized heterozygosity takes into account that not all samples will be genotyped for all
of the same loci by ensuring that the heterozygosity of all individuals is measured on the
same scale. Individual heterozygosity (Hs) is calculated such that Hs = proportion of
heterozygous typed loci/mean heterozygosity of typed loci (Coltman et al. 1999).
Parthenogens are expected to have a positive IR values, low SH values, and high HL values
(Alho et al. 2010).
3. Results and discussion
Our study robustly demonstrates multiple cases of facultative parthenogenesis
resulting in viable male offspring in two species of elapids with different reproductive modes:
the oviparous Papuan/Coastal Taipan and the viviparous Southern Death Adder. All the
females in our study had reproduced sexually with males prior to producing the parthenogens
reported here. HenceSex of parthenogen offspring was determined to be male by way of
probing and manually everting the hemipenis. Booth & Schuett (2011) documented long-term
sperm storage of ~ 5 years followed by the production of viable offspring in an eastern
diamondback rattlesnake, (Crotalus adamanteus), hence, it was necessary to exclude the
possibility that offspring were produced using sperm stored from these previous breeding
events (i.e. eliminating all sampled males as sires was not sufficient evidence for FP).
Molecular analysis of the Papuan/Coastal Taipan and Southern Death Adder putative
parthenogen samples yielded genotypes that had high internal relatedness (> 0.152), i.e.
significantly greater than zero (Table 12 and Figures 1 & 21A & 1B), which is indicative of
parthenogenesis (Alho et al. 2010). The standardized heterozygosity was also low (0.302–
0.539) and homozygosity by loci was high (0.694–0.884) in the putative parthenogens, also
consistent with parthenogenesis (Table 12 and Figure 31C).
The clutches and litter of parthenogens reported here add to other documented
accounts of parthenogenetic reproduction in the caenophidians, which also yielded low
fertility rate (i.e. low fertile vs infertile clutch ratio) and only male offspring (Schuett et al.,
1997; Booth & Schuett 2011, 2015). yielding low fertility rates (i.e. low fertile vs infertile
clutch ratio) and phenotypically only males (Schuett et al., 1997; Booth & Schuett 2011,
2015). We were unable to confirm the sex of the parthenogens genetically as the structure and
content of the Z and W sex chromosomes are largely unknown from the few snake genomes
that exist, so we could not confirm the lack of female parthenogens by mapping the ddRAD-
seq data to the published snake genomes. Nor did we genotype enough confidently sexed
males and females to definitively identify sex-specific ddRAD markers (Gamble et al. 2014).
With regards to the health of the parthenogens, the litter of death adders included stillborn
offspring that exhibited post-cranial developmental abnormalities like those reported in the
checkered garter snake (Thamnophis marcianus) by Booth & Schuett (2015). The apparent
health of our parthenogens varies individually. All Papuan/Coastal Taipan parthenogens
remain alive with the oldest of which being ~ 3.5 years old and the two death adders failed to
thrive dying >2 months after birth. Two of the four Papuan/Coastal Taipans appear robust
and as normal sexually produced specimens would, with the other two displaying slight
physical abnormalities (Table 1). Irrespective of this all Papuan/Coastal Taipans appear to be
robust and developing normally.
Our findings represent the first evidence of FP in the Elapidae, which extends our
knowledge of FP in snakes. More targeted research is required to determine the prevalence of
this alternate reproductive mode in the elapids, particularly the taxonomic breadth and
ecological role of its occurrence in natural populations. Better understanding of the effects of
parthenogenetic reproduction on heterozygosity and fertility over multiple generations is also
needed to inform conservation of genetic diversity in wild and captive snake popplations.
