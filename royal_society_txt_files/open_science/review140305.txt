My own interest in this paper is limited to Section 4, but I have no reason to believe that the
mathematical arguments as a whole are not sound.
Above equation 4.1 the authors remark that the angle pi on the RHS of 4.1 is perfectly reasonable
from the example of the Salter Duck. The controversy in the literature has been because it is not at
all reasonable at first sight from the example of the Evans Cylinder (discussed by the authors
after equation 6.8), which radiates waves in the opposite direction, when oscillating in still water.
I believe the controversy has been settled by the written discussion of Farley (2013) – discussion
specifically cited by the authors. In it Farley appears to accept that Newman’s result is correct, but
criticises it for requiring time to be reversed in the still-water oscillations of the device. His
criticism presumably applies likewise to much of the present paper.
I myself do not share his misgivings over the use of reversed time – it is only the oscillations of
the device which are being reversed in time, and that is easy to arrange in the laboratory, by
changing all their phases. The motion of the water is not being reversed in time, in that the
radiated waves continue to propagate outwards. So for me it is a useful physical insight.
The controversy has engaged the attention of a number of leading researchers in this field, so I
think a fuller account of it in the present paper would widen its appeal.

This paper deals with the theoretical aspects of wave power absorption from the wave-structure
interaction perspective. It extends previous results for the maximum absorbed power for the
cases of WEC arrays, including OWCs. The paper is regarded as worth publishing.

Decision letter (RSOS-140305)
23-Jan-2015
Dear Dr Kurniawan
On behalf of the Editor, I am pleased to inform you that your Manuscript RSOS-140305 entitled
"Fundamental formulae for wave-energy conversion" has been accepted for publication in Royal
Society Open Science subject to minor revision in accordance with the referee suggestions. Please
find the referees' comments at the end of this email.
The reviewers and Subject Editor have recommended publication if you are able to revise to
address the reviewers comments. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise
your manuscript.
Please also ensure that the following sections are included if required.
• Ethics statement
If your study uses humans or animals please include details of the ethical approval received,
including the name of the committee that granted approval. For human studies please also detail
whether informed consent was obtained. For field studies on animals please include details of all
permissions, licences and/or approvals granted to carry out the fieldwork.
• Data accessibility
It is a condition of publication that all supporting data are made available either as
supplementary information or preferably in a suitable permanent repository. The data
accessibility section should state where the article's supporting data can be accessed. This section
should also include details, where possible of where to access other relevant research materials
such as statistical tools, protocols, software etc can be accessed. If the data has been deposited in
an external repository this section should list the database, accession number and link to the DOI
for all data from the article that has been made publicly available. Data sets that have been
deposited in an external repository and have a DOI should also be appropriately cited in the
manuscript and included in the reference list.
• Competing interests
Please declare any financial or non-financial competing interests, or state that you have no
competing interests.
• Authors’ contributions
All submissions, other than those with a single author, must include an Authors’ Contributions
section which individually lists the specific contribution of each author. The list of Authors
should meet all of the following criteria; 1) substantial contributions to conception and design, or
acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it
critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be published.
All contributors who do not meet all of these criteria should be included in the
acknowledgements.
We suggest the following format:
AB carried out the molecular lab work, participated in data analysis, carried out sequence
alignments, participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript; CD carried out
the statistical analyses; EF collected field data; GH conceived of the study, designed the study,
coordinated the study and helped draft the manuscript. All authors gave final approval for
publication.

• Acknowledgements
Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship
criteria.
• Funding statement
Please list the source of funding for each author.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days (i.e. by the 01-Feb-2015). If you do not think
you will be able to meet this date please let me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) Included your supplementary files in a format you are happy with (no line numbers,
vancouver referencing, track changes removed etc) as these files will NOT be edited in
production
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.
Best wishes
