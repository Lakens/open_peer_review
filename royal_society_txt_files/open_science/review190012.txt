I enjoyed this paper, and think it is a sound approach to an interesting set of scientific problems.
One thing that caught my eye was that the phase portraits and system trajectories in section 3
were strongly reminiscent of this earlier work, which was not discussed or cited:
Warren, P.B., 2009. Cells, cancer, and rare events: Homeostatic metastability in stochastic
nonlinear dynamical models of skin cell proliferation. Physical Review E, 80(3), p.030903.
In particular, this work derives similar phase portraits and sketches of the system dynamics,
including tumorigenesis as an attractor of biological systems that escape some basin of stability,
representing homeostasis. While the current paper by Y. Lou et al. is a more substantial and
detailed study of the same problems, I feel this paper would be enriched by a brief (2 sentence?)
discussion of P.B. Warren 2009.
Otherwise I think their survey of the literature seems fine. The essential papers by D. Drasdo and
B.D. Simons are all there.
The introduction of the model could also be described a bit more clearly. Something like "Cells
switch at a rate proportional to the number of neighbours of type X" would help a lot. At present,
the simple description is very short and the abstract mathematical description much longer,
which has the effect of swamping the simple explanation. It is a simple and elegant model and I
think this should be emphasised.

Yuting et al present a model of multicellular homeostasis using a 2D stochastic cellular
automaton framework. Although quite technical in places all the methods, including the master
equations and mean field approximation are well presented and the assumptions made are
appropriate. Overall, the development of the model is well explained and the exploration of the
phase planes both statistically (Monte Carlo) and analytically (Mean Fields followed by Jacobian)
is well done. The sharp transitions seen in the phase planes are not that surprising. Towards the
end of the paper (Figure 9), the authors introduce realism into the model by including a
threshold-dependent cell death they although the oscillating value for cell death is a little odd.
One point that I found unclear was the technical details of the correlation length (method behind
Figure 7) but it makes sense that the agents will be highly correlated at the start of the simulation
and at the end of the simulation if they undergo a quick extinction or a degradation as they seem
to suggest.

be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.

30th May, 2019
Dear editor of Royal Society Open Science,
We thank the editors and reviewer’s comments on this manuscript and complete
minor revisions on it. We have added some reference papers to the introduction part
and revised the description of our model in a more straightforward manner
(highlighted in yellow). Besides, we added some technical demonstrations on how to
obtain the correlation length in Sec. 4.2 (highlighted in pink). We hope that these
revisions improve the quality of this paper. The detailed answers to each point by the
reviewers are listed as below.
***********************************************************************************
Reviewer 1 (correspondent revision is highlighted in yellow in the manuscript):
1. On the reference of P.B. Warren 2009
One thing that caught my eye was that the phase portraits and system trajectories in section 3
were strongly reminiscent of this earlier work, which was not discussed or cited:
Warren, P.B., 2009. Cells, cancer, and rare events: Homeostatic metastability in stochastic nonlinear
dynamical models of skin cell proliferation. Physical Review E, 80(3), p.030903.
In particular, this work derives similar phase portraits and sketches of the system dynamics,
including tumorigenesis as an attractor of biological systems that escape some basin of stability,
representing homeostasis. While the current paper by Y. Lou et al. is a more substantial and
detailed study of the same problems, I feel this paper would be enriched by a brief (2 sentence?)
discussion of P.B. Warren 2009.
Answer:
We thank the reviewer for the recommendation of this paper. It is indeed very important
and relevant to our research and so are the other related papers therein. We have added
several sentences in the introduction as suggested (line 37-42) to enrich the background
part.
2. On the description of model in Introduction
The introduction of the model could also be described a bit more clearly. Something like
"Cells switch at a rate proportional to the number of neighbours of type X" would help a lot.
At present, the simple description is very short and the abstract mathematical description
much longer, which has the effect of swamping the simple explanation. It is a simple and
elegant model and I think this should be emphasised.
Answer:
We take the suggestion here and try to make model description in Introduction easier to
read (line 52-54). We thank the reviewer’s appreciation on our model.
Reviewer 2 (correspondent revisions highlighted in pink in the manuscript)
1. On the odd types of cell death
The authors introduce realism into the model by including a threshold-dependent cell death
they although the oscillating value for cell death is a little odd.
Answer:
We are sorry for unclear demonstration on the motivation of introducing these
modifications. These may not have accurate biological meaning and we propose them
here only to demonstrate the model behaviour under some non-uniform and constant
setting of the control parameters and provide some hints for more realistic extensions.
We add some explanations on our motivation in line 494-495.
2. On the technical details of the correlation length
One point that I found unclear was the technical details of the correlation length (method
behind Figure 7) but it makes sense that the agents will be highly correlated at the start of
the simulation and at the end of the simulation if they undergo a quick extinction or a
degradation as they seem to suggest.
Answer:
We thank the reviewer for pointing out this problem of unclear demonstration on
correlation length. The correlation length is calculated by fitting parameters in the
correlation function (eq.10). The average <U+F0E1><U+F0F1> is taken over a period of homeostatic
growth (where the numbers of proliferative and quiescent cells are fluctuating around
some values before the system goes to extinct or degenerate) and over 40000 sessions
of simulations. A very important thing is that correlation length is only measurable
when the system is in the proliferative phase with infinite size (see the phase P in
Fig.5(c) ).
The details of fitting procedures is as such: 1) by varying the control parameter d,
one can find the critical points where the correlation function C(l) decays in a power-
law function C(l) <U+F0B5> l-a. 2)Measure the powers a of decay at the critical points. 3)
Calculate the correlation function C(l) for the range of control parameter near this
critical point and fit Eq.10 to obtain the correlation length <U+03BE>.
We make the technical demonstration on correlation length clearer in the Sec. (line
421-423 and line 431-435) and hope this revision may improve the readability of this
part.
