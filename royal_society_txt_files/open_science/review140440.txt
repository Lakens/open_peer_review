label_comment_2
Dear authors,
I read with interest your article on bone histology and growth of the Placodontia. This is a
valuable and timely study, considering the scarcity of our knowledge on the paleobiology of
these animals.
I nevertheless consider that your article must be corrected and improved in many respects
because it suffers various problems briefly enumerated below. Please refer also to the annotated
PDF of your manuscript to see punctual remarks, questions, corrections or suggestions.
1. In my opinion, this article is much too long, and an effort to shorten it is imperative. For
example, the long recalls and general statements about the basal-most aspects of bone histology
given p.4 lines 19-58, p. 5, lines 1-59, page 6, lines 1-47, should be replaced by a 15 to 20 lines
paragraph with relevant quotations.
2. The general plan of this article is hardly comprehensible. Apparently, histological observations
(i.e. formal results) are given in the part dealing with methods. In addition, the considerations
developed in the first part of the discussion can be viewed as results. An effort for clearly
separating the methods from the observations, and the observations from the discussion is
needed.
3. The methodological approach that you followed is far from being clear on a capital point: what
are exactly the "histological data" (sic.) that were used for computing the growth curves? Is it the
length of the bones vs the number of SGM (i.e. skeletal growth marks), as suggested by the curves
of Fig. 6. Is it the length of each growth mark vs its appositional rank in the cortex? Is it the
perimeter of the bones vs skeletochronological age ? I searched in the text but I could not find any
clear information about the nature of the "histological data" used for estimating growth rates, and
the manner they were collected or measured. As a consequence, the quality of your results,
discussion and conclusion cannot be clearly assessed.
3
4. There are several odd or obscure statements in your histological descriptions. Please refer to
the remarks and comments in the PDF.
5. The most important subject treated in this article, i.e. the interpretation of placodont growth
and thermal regime from histological clues, was already approached in detail (but with
qualitative observations) by Buffrenil and Mazin (1993). These authors are quoted anecdotically
in your article; however, their descriptions and conclusions should be considered in more detail
because they prefigure yours in many respects.
6. The size of figures 2 - 5 is too small to allow any precise histological observation. I guess it is be
easy to enlarge them.
7. At last, the English used in this manuscript is very approximative. It should be corrected
thoroughly by a native English speaker.

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-140440)
Response to the reviewer’s comments Dear editor, We are thankful to the reviewer’s constructive
and helpful comments. We have shortened the text and hopefully deleted all repetitions and
more general statements following the suggestions of reviewer 1. We have added three new
5
figures (Fig. 2-4), one depicting the hatchling bone tissue (Fig. 2; now called perinatal tissue)
following the suggestion of reviewer 2. We have added two new figures depicting details of the
growth record of all studied Placodontia (Fig 3 and 4) following the suggestion of reviewer 1. We
attached a file where all context-related changes are marked. However, this was to confusing for
a linguistic revision, which was then done in a version that was cleaned from all text related
changes. Thus, we attached the marked-changes file where we have changed the context and a
plaintext version that also includes linguistic changes. If requested we can of course also upload
the file containing the language changes. We hope that we have addressed all comments
adequately and/or have explained sufficiently if we did not follow the reviewers’ suggestions. If
not, please feel free to contact us again. Sincerely Nicole Klein

Dear authors,
I read your article for the second time with interest. Some topics have been made more explicit, as
compared to the first version. However, in my opinion, this article remains too long, and could be
substantially shortened without any loss of information. In particular, the subdivision of the
results adopted in this manuscript leads to a repetitive and tedious presentation of growth data.
The parts entitled "The growth record of Placodontia", "Validation of growth models with
histological data", and "Comparison of growth models vs. histological data" should be fused into
a single part that could be named "Inference of growth from bone histology".
Sincerely yours

Subject Editor comments:
As reviewer 1 says, the manuscript is unnecessarily long and wordy. The authors should cut it
down to half its size and focus on what is new. Reviewer 2 also has extensive suggestions which
need to be addressed before a decision can be made.
Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-140440.R1)
Dear editor, We were not able to work with the marked-changes text of R1 because it was much
too confusing. For our revision we used the plaintext of R1. However, before activating the
“mark-changes in text button” we copied all parts of the results together and the moved text
passages are not marked herein. We uploaded now the file with the changes made in the
plaintext of R1. Please note that also the cutbanks in the reference list are not marked in that file.
We are again thankful to the reviewer’s constructive and helpful comments and the time they
spent reviewing our text. We have again shortened the text significantly and followed reviewer
1’s suggestion and combined/fused all results. We have accepted and followed all suggestions
reviewer 2 has made and have rephrased the paragraph where he had found a problematic
content-wise statement (see a detailed list below). The focus of the text is now on what is new
(results on placodont growth). We did not explain the method in detail but refer here to the
published papers. However, we were not able to cut the text of half its size without loss of
information as was requested by the editor. Since the figures had not changed we will not upload
them again. Sincerely Nicole Klein (See Appendix C.)

neral comments:
s is a very interesting and methodically cutting-edge paper. Placodont bone histology has
n very little studied so far, and growth modeling has not been applied to any marine reptile
up before. However, there are still many small linguistic and punctuation problems in the
nuscript. I request that the second authors, who is a native English speaker, goes through the
to eliminate these.
cific comments:
e 7, line 40: Explain the taxonomic assignment to aff. Cyamodus Why the uncertainty? what
ut the Placodontia indet.? How do you know these are placodont bones in the first place?
6: What do you mean by hatchling bone? Is this embryonic or perinatal? Is there embryonic
e preserved? How fast was the hatchling bone preserved?
53: Please always give specimen numbers when discussing specific bones. This is a problem
ughout the histological descriptions.
13: How do you explain these vastly different numbers for the same taxon?
5ff: The histologic variation in the Psephoderma bones could be due to different species being
resented. There are several P. species, and these differ in size. Although both specimens are
aetian, they are from different localities. Finally, discuss sexual dimorphism as an explanation,
ch is well documented for some sauropterygians.
15: From here on, I have given up correcting the English. Author Neenan is a native speaker
has to ensure proper English in the revised version.
16ff: I am afraid this paragraph does not make any sense to me.
18: Maybe marine turtles would make a better comparison with placodonts than amphibians
terrestrial reptiles?
8ff: This argument is problematic because several of your placodonts are from the Tethys, not
Germanic Basin.
26ff: Paragraph is too speculative and not based on any evidence, delete it.
29: Is this really true? My understanding is that carbonate platforms were generally nearby.
48ff: This discussion is contained in an earlier section already. Either delete it there or take
this section.
15-18: I am left confused. What are you trying to say here?
26: Again, why not sexual dimorphism? The discussion needs to be strengthened in this
ard.
38 (and earlier occurrences): All growth depends on endogenous factors. Rephrase!

Response to general comments of Reviewer 1
Dear authors,
I read with interest your article on bone histology and growth of the Placodontia. This is a
valuable and timely study, considering the scarcity of our knowledge on the paleobiology of
these animals. I nevertheless consider that your article must be corrected and improved in
many respects because it suffers various problems briefly enumerated below. Please refer also
to the annotated PDF of your manuscript to see punctual remarks, questions, corrections or
suggestions.
1. In my opinion, this article is much too long, and an effort to shorten it is imperative. For
example, the long recalls and general statements about the basal-most aspects of bone
histology given p.4 lines 19-58, p. 5, lines 1-59, page 6, lines 1-47, should be replaced by a 15
to 20 lines paragraph with relevant quotations.
We have shortened the requested paragraphs.
2a. The general plan of this article is hardly comprehensible. Apparently, histological
observations (i.e. formal results) are given in the part dealing with methods.
We have re-arranged the manuscript and added new paragraphs at the respective places to
be more clear and precise in terms of the general plan of the manuscript.
We have moved the summary on bone histological features of placodonts to the Results
section. A detailed description of bone histology and microanatomy of placodonts was
recently published by Klein et al. (2015).
2b. In addition, the considerations developed in the first part of the discussion can be viewed
as results. An effort for clearly separating the methods from the observations, and the
observations from the discussion is needed.
We have re-arranged this accordingly.
3. The methodological approach that you followed is far from being clear on a capital point:
what are exactly the "histological data" (sic.) that were used for computing the growth curves?
Is it the length of the bones vs the number of SGM (i.e. skeletal growth marks), as suggested
by the curves of Fig. 6. Is it the length of each growth mark vs its appositional rank in the
cortex? Is it the perimeter of the bones vs skeletochronological age ? I searched in the text but
I could not find any clear information about the nature of the "histological data" used for
estimating growth rates, and the manner they were collected or measured. As a consequence,
the quality of your results, discussion and conclusion cannot be clearly assessed.
We are sorry for not having been more specific in that topic. We have re-written the text
adequately, and hope that our approach is now easier to follow. A detailed description of the
method was already given in Griebeler et al. (2013), which is freely online available.
4. There are several odd or obscure statements in your histological descriptions. Please refer
to the remarks and comments in the PDF.
We have changed the text accordingly to the reviewer’s suggestions or explained why we
disagree (see response to detailed comments below).
5. The most important subject treated in this article, i.e. the interpretation of placodont growth
and thermal regime from histological clues, was already approached in detail (but with
qualitative observations) by Buffrenil and Mazin (1993). These authors are quoted
anecdotically in your article; however, their descriptions and conclusions should be
considered in more detail because they prefigure yours in many respects.
We had referred to this valuable paper in our manuscript before, and added more links to it in
the revision. We are sorry that the reviewer thinks we did not adequately cite it. However, our
ms deals with the analyses of the growth pattern, which was not analyzed or recorded in
Buffrenil and Mazin (1993).
6. The size of figures 2 - 5 is too small to allow any precise histological observation. I guess it
is be easy to enlarge them.
Following the reviewers suggestion we have added two new figures (Fig. 3, 4) depicting
details of the growth records. Details of histology were already published in Klein et al.
(2015).
7. At last, the English used in this manuscript is very approximative. It should be corrected
thoroughly by a native English speaker.
The English was corrected by JN who is a native speaker and we hope that the English is now
adequate/fine.
Response to detailed comments of Reviewer 1 given in the PDF
We have incorporated the reviewers suggestions (see marked changes doc file) made in the
attached pdf file. If further explanations are necessary or when we disagree with the reviewer
we have explained below why.
Page 4 comment 4:
We disagree with the reviewer who wanted us to delete “resting lines”. The work of
Francillon-Vieillot et al. (1990: p.211-212) is a standard in histology and for histological
terminology they list rest lines as growth marks. We have added the reference in this sentence
and changed the term “resting lines” used by us in the first version of the manuscript into
“rest lines” throughout the text to indicate that we used the terminology of these authors.
Page 6 comment 1:
This recall of basic bone histology (from page 4, line 19 to page 6, line 6) is much too long. It
should be summarized in 10 to 15 lines, at most. More over, do these considerations have
influenced your method for "reading" growth marks ? If so, how ?
We have elaborated on this topic to make clear how diverse the growth mark record of
placodonts is and what exactly we have considered and counted as annual growth marks.
Nevertheless, we were able to shorten this paragraph.
Page 8 comment 1:
I do not understand the plan of this article. What is this part: a description of the biological
sample (namely Material) or the beginning of histological observations (i.e. the Results)?
We re-arranged the ms accordingly and hope to be clearer and more precise now on the
questionable topics also the revised abstract should be more clear in terms of the general
plan of the manuscript.
We have moved the summary on bone histological features of placodonts to the Results
section. A detailed description of bone histology and microanatomy of placodonts was
recently published by Klein et al. (2015).
Page 8 comment 2:
What was your purpose in doing so ?
We have added a sentence to explain why we had done this.
Page 8 comment 3:
Meaning ?If a tissue is formed of parallel-fibered bone + primary osteons, why do you call it
"fibro-lamellar"?
The bone tissue of some placodonts consists of a mixture of coarse parallel-fibred bone and
woven bone and it also contains primary osteons. We are aware that by definition
fibrolamellar bone consists of woven bone + primary osteons, but here locally also coarse
parallel-fibred bone is involved/deposited in addition to the woven bone. Thus, the tissue has
the scaffolding /3D arrangement of fibrolamellar bone, although it contains not only woven
bone but also coarse parallel-fibred bone. Modifications of the fibrolamellar bone by
parallel-fibred bone were also described for early pseudosuchian archosaurs (Ricqlès et al.,
2003), the ornithopod dinosaur Gasparinisaura (Cerda and Chinsamy, 2012), and the
titanosaur dinosaur Ampelosaurus (Klein et al., 2012a). Coarse parallel-fibred bone on the
other hand was described for the temnospondyl Plagiosaurus (Konietzko-Meier and Schmitt,
2013), and Houssaye et al. (2013) described an unusual parallel-fibred bone for mosasaurs.
In placodonts, this coarse parallel-fibred tissue is intermixed with woven bone in a fibro-
lamellar bone tissue, which is in detail described in Klein et al. (2015).
Page 9 comment 1:
Do these considerations belong to the part "methods" ? In my opinion, they are results, and
should be placed elsewhere. Moreover, this part should refer to figures.
We re-arranged the ms accordingly and hope to be clearer and more precise in the revision.
However, the requested paragraph belongs to the method section because it explains what we
have done/counted and how we have distinguished annual growth marks from non-annual
growth marks in placodonts.
Page 9 comment 2:
We have added new figures to address this comment. Histological details are published in
Klein et al. (2015).
Page10 comment 1:
What have you measured exactly for computing the growth curves, and to what do the expressions
"histological data" and "histological growth series" refer? Is it the spacing of growth marks, is it their
lengths, is it the perimeter of the bones in growth series, etc? This basic and most important
information is given nowhere in your manuscript.
We are sorry for not having been more specific in that topic. However, a detailed description
of the methods was already given in Griebeler et al. (2013), which is freely online available.
We have re-written the text adequately, and hope that our approach is now easier to follow.
Page11 comment 1:
What is the precise meaning of this expression? See remark above.
We have rephrased this to be more specific.
Page12 comment 1:
Evidence for this settlement ?
We have rephrased this to indicate that this is our own interpretation. The reason why we
think so is given in the next sentence.
Page14 comment 1, Page 15, comment 1:
This long description should be much shortened and supported by good detailed photos of bone
histology. Figures 2-5 give a general idea of bone micro-anatomy, but nor of bone histology.
We disagree with the reviewer here. We think that the long description is necessary, because
it is used for the biological validation of our models and is the basis for our interpretation.
We further think that the figures are adequate but we have added (Fig. 3, 4) new figures that
depict details of the growth marks. Our intention is to show the growth record (i.e. the annual
growth marks) and not histological details, which are already published elsewhere (Klein et
al., 2015).
Response to general comments of Reviewer 2
General comments:
This is a very interesting and methodically cutting-edge paper. Placodont bone histology has
been very little studied so far, and growth modeling has not been applied to any marine reptile
group before. However, there are still many small linguistic and punctuation problems in the
manuscript. I request that the second authors, who is a native English speaker, goes through
the text to eliminate these.
JN who is a native speaker has reworked the manuscript and corrected the English.
Specific comments:
page 7, line 40: Explain the taxonomic assignment to aff. Cyamodus. Why the uncertainty?
What about the Placodontia indet.? How do you know these are placodont bones in the first
place?
We have added a paragraph that shortly refers to the taxonomic assignment of sampled
bones. The taxonomic assignment of the studied bones is addressed in detail in Klein et al.
(2015s).
9/46: What do you mean by hatchling bone? Is this embryonic or perinatal? Is there
embryonic bone preserved? How fast was the hatchling bone preserved?
We have replaced the term “hatchling” by perinatal/perinate sensu Horner et al. (2001). We
have emended the description of the perinatal boen tissue and discussed its growth rate.
Further on we have added a new figure (Fig. 2) depicting perinatal bone tissue of different
specimens.
11/53: Please always give specimen numbers when discussing specific bones. This is a
problem throughout the histological descriptions.
We have added the requested specimen numbers throughout the text where necessary.
18/13: How do you explain these vastly different numbers for the same taxon?
We are not quite sure, which problem is addressed by the reviewer. Large differences in sizes
and ages of individuals observed in populations can result from their genetic constitution in
general (genetic plasticity) and from differences between sexes (as noted by the reviewer), but
also from environmental differences (developmental plasticity). We hope that in the revised
manuscript we more carefully interpret differences in size and age-related life history traits of
specimens.
21/5ff: The histologic variation in the Psephoderma bones could be due to different species
being represented. There are several P. species, and these differ in size. Although both
specimens are Rhaetian, they are from different localities. Finally, discuss sexual dimorphism
as an explanation, which is well documented for some sauropterygians.
According to Rieppel (2000), which is still up to date, there are no more species of
Psephoderma described (former species are synonymised) but we added the possibility of sex.
dimorphism or developmental plasticity according to the reviewers suggestion.
22/15: From here on, I have given up correcting the English. Author Neenan is a native
speaker and has to ensure proper English in the revised version.
JN who is a native speaker has reworked the manuscript and corrected the English.
23/16ff: I am afraid this paragraph does not make any sense to me.
We have reformulated this paragraph in the revised manuscript.
24/18: Maybe marine turtles would make a better comparison with placodonts than
amphibians and terrestrial reptiles?
We did not write “terrestrial” and we did not use the term “reptiles” in a phylogenetic
perspective and thus do not exclude turtles. We thus see no need to change this here.
26/8ff: This argument is problematic because several of your placodonts are from the Tethys,
not the Germanic Basin.
We agree with the reviewer and have deleted this paragraph.
26/26ff: Paragraph is too speculative and not based on any evidence, delete it.
We agree with the reviewer and have deleted this paragraph.
27/29: Is this really true? My understanding is that carbonate platforms were generally
nearby.
We have rephrased this sentence.
27/48ff: This discussion is contained in an earlier section already. Either delete it there or take
out this section.
We have deleted this repetition.
28/15-18: I am left confused. What are you trying to say here?
We have rephrased this and add the link to Klein et al. (2015) where the problem is explained
in detail.
28/26: Again, why not sexual dimorphism? The discussion needs to be strengthened in this
regard.
We have rephrased this adequately.
28/38 (and earlier occurrences): All growth depends on endogenous factors. Rephrase!
We have rephrased this adequately.
Response to the detailed comments of Reviewer 2 im PDF? (s.o.)
We have incorporated the reviewers suggestions (see marked changes doc file) made in the
attached pdf file. If further explanations are necessary or when we disagree with the reviewer
we have explained below why:
Page 2, comment 4: This reference is now published.
Page 4, comment 1: We have rephrased this accordingly.
Page 6, comment 1: Woodward et al. (2014) mentioned that double LAGs do not occur in the
alligator but this does not exclude there existence art all, which was documented in many
other taxa (see references in the text).
Page 6 comment 3: We have strongly overworked this paragraph and hope we have
addressed the reviewers comment.
Page 18 comment 1 We have rephrased this sentence.
Page 21 Comment 5 We have rephrased this sentence.
Page 23 Comment 1 We have rephrased this sentence.
Page 27 Comment 2 We have rephrased this accordingly.
Page 28 Comment 2 We have rephrased this sentence.
Page 51 Comment 1 The taxon Horaffia is only based on five humerus and it was never
included into a phylogenetic analysis due to the lack of reasonable numbers of codable
features. We have rephrased the paragraph and explained why we think that it belongs to
Placodontia.
Comment to Fig. 6 We overworked Fig. 6. For the legend and the text labels we now use a
much smaller font. The resulting saving of space allowed us to enlarge the pictures with the
growth curves of specimens.
Appendix C
Response to the reviewer’s comments
Dear editor,
We are again thankful to the reviewer’s constructive and helpful comments and the time they
spent reviewing our text. We have again shortened the text significantly and followed
reviewer 1’s suggestion and combined/fused all results.
We have accepted and followed all suggestions reviewer 2 has made and have rephrased the
paragraph where he had found a problematic content-wise statement (see a detailed list
below).
We were not able to work with the marked-changes text of R1 because it was much too
confusing to work with it. For our revision we used the plaintext of R1. However, before
activating the “mark-changes in text button” we copied all parts of the results together and the
moved text passages are not marked herein.
The focus of the text is now on what is new (results on placodont growth). We did not explain
the method in detail but refer here to the published papers. However, we were not able to cut
the text of half its size without loss of information as was requested by the editor.
Sincerely
Nicole Klein
