The authors describe the results of a study in which they investigate if there is any typical pattern
that characterizes motor interactions where one person hands a cup to another one. The authors
perform interesting analysis of videos of interactions and report characteristic patterns some of
which depend on the difficulty of the task or on the pairs of individuals involved. While the main
idea underlying the study is interesting, I have some concerns about methodological aspects.
Here are my points:
-In the abstract as well as in the discussion, the authors state they demonstrate that handover
interaction contains many distinct and characteristic patterns. However I believe that this may
represent an overstatement due to a possibly fatal shortcoming of the experimental design.
Indeed, in order to show that the resulting patterns are characteristic of handover interactions,
the authors should include a control condition, in which, for instance, one participant alone
displace the cup from one saucer to the other. I acknowledge that this strictly ‘solo’ task may be
moch different with respect to dual interactive condition. Still, it is important to have a condition
where a comparable complexity of the task does not imply a social duality (e.g. a condition in
which the interaction occurs with a mechanical device or in which the solo performer avoid an
obstacle to position the cup somewhere else). Without such type of control, I am afraid, it is
impossible to attribute the results described in this report to social interaction.
-Page 5, the authors refer : ”Crucially, we further expect that handover interaction patterns are
affected by changes in the task. We test this prediction by adjusting the difficulty of the handover
task”. The difficulty of the task is manipulated by including a condition in which the cup is full of
dry rice and one in which it is empty. In the results the authors indicate “The average duration of
handover interactions with full cups is significantly longer than with empty cups…This confirms
that our experimental manipulation of task difficulty is successful: handing over a cup full of rice
without spilling any of the content requires more effort than handing over an empty cup”.
However it is not reported whether participants received the instruction of being as fast as
possible, this information is important in order to be able to conclude that being slower actually
means the task was more difficult. It is reported, instead, that participants received the
instruction of not to spill any rice. Even though the authors indicate that only small amounts of
rice were spilled, it might be interesting to consider the fact of spilling the rice as an index of
participants’ performance , in order to test whether distinct patterns occur more frequently for
successful/unsuccessful interactions.
-How behavioral state sequences were selected? Why looking at the saucer was not considered
among the behavioral state sequences (considering that the saucer is the goal towards which
participants are planning the placing action)?
-In the supplementary information it is indicated that 25 pairs of participants were involved in
the experiment. The authors also report that “Given the extent of manual data analysis required
and substantial loss of eye tracking data for one or the other participant in a pair, we restrict
analysis to the first 20 handover tasks for full and empty cups for those 11 pairs of participants
with complete data sets”. It seems to me that in this way there is a big loss of collected data.
Which was the criterion used to select exactly 20 handover trials and not any other number? Why
the half-filled cup condition was not considered?
-In supplementary information, table S1, it is reported that 7 out of 11 included pairs were
performing the empty cup condition before the full cup. Do you think that the higher familiarity
with the full cup condition might have influenced the characteristic patterns found more
frequently in this condition?
3
- I think that quoting works from Becchio et al. in the introduction might make it more exhaustive
in giving an overview of works investigating the kinematic patterns of motor interactions specific
for different social contexts.

label_comment_2
The manuscript presents a data-mining approach to joint action. To that end, a few behavioral
parameters are coded from eye-tracking videos of pairs of participants handing over empty or
full cups to each other. These data are then submitted to an analysis that extracts characteristic
(i.e. frequent) patterns of participants’ task performance. Specifically, the authors look for
transitions in gaze location and object-related movements. They discuss their approach in light of
its use for the analysis of social interaction as well as human-robot interaction.
After reading the manuscript, I have unfortunately neither learned something really new about
joint actions nor would I now be able to perform a new type of analysis on social interaction data.
I find it very difficult to thoroughly follow the vast amount of analysis steps and data
transformations that are reported and, maybe even more importantly, it is not always clear to me
why they were done and what we gain from them. Thus, I feel this work is at present neither a
research paper on social interaction nor a useful methods paper but rather something in between.
To be constructive, I have two alternative suggestions. The first one (which I find more
promising) is to turn this into a proper method paper that presents a new approach in a detailed
and well-explained way so that readers of all backgrounds can profit from the methodological
and statistical advancements by applying this analysis to their own data. This route would
require a rewriting with a focus on motivating each step in the analysis and presenting it as
accessible as possible. The second suggestion (which I am a little more hesitant about) is to
simplify the reported analysis, focus on some very specific aspects of the hand-over task and
clearly explain what findings are new and why we cannot find them with a more classical general
Psychology approach. This would also require a more focused introduction, better motivation for
certain choices (e.g. why parameter 2, “looks elsewhere”, was included which I do not consider a
very convincing behavioral marker) and clearer attempts to explain the behavioral findings in the
discussion.

I will not go into more detailed comments about the manuscript at this point because I think it
should first be revised as suggested. I am quite positive that this work could then make a useful
contribution.

The Authors of the paper present a new method for studying the presence and occurrence of
behavioral states patterns (as well as their length and changes) in the case of a relatively simple
interpersonal interaction (i.e. grasping a cup and passing it to a partner who takes it). The method
offers the possibility to model both the individual as well as the pair joint behavior. The method
is well described and different options are listed and explained. An R code is also provided as
supplementary material to perform the analyses. The differences between the proposed method
and similar ones already available are discussed and the complementarity between them is
highlighted properly.
I find the method extremely interesting and timely as it provides a useful tool for researchers
working on interpersonal interactions from a wide range of perspectives.
My main points concern the chance to make the description of the method even more clear for a
broader readership of researchers.
The term “social interaction” is somewhat loose in the present context. I believe that the Authors
may want to specify that the example situation they are using to illustrate the potentialities of the
method concerns “motor interaction” more than social interactions in the large.
Line102: studying “the mechanisms describing how people OBSERVE other people performing
such visually-guided actions” in not a direct proxy to Theory of Mind unless one describes the
eye-movements of the observer. The Authors may want to say that studying the mechanisms that
underpin “GAZING BEHAVIOR” is a proxy to Theory of Mind.
I would suggest the Authors to try and make it even more clear what is the functional meaning of
the used indexes (BSS, pattern of behavioral states, delta, FS, CIS, …). This is already done in the
current version of the paper but I guess that a broader readership would benefit from a further
effort in this sense (e.g. provide one sentence where the meaning of each of these indexes is
explained after it is introduced).
One possible way to help the reader in grasping the structure and the strength of the method
might be to include a table where the meaning of BSS, FS, CIS, … is briefly explained in one
sentence, their relation are made clear and the different parameters (theta, etc) are explained.
The possibility to study the occurrence of specific state sequences is done at page 13 line 370
where the Authors indicate that one possible application of the method is to “record if in a CIS
first exclusively one and than exclusively the other interaction partner displays a particular
behavioral state”. This point may be of great interest for experimental psychologists who look for
the causal relation between specific states of interacting partners.
At the end of page 13 the results of the mentioned properties (lines 362-370) of CISs concerning
points 3 (length) and 5 (specificity and temporal order of partners’ states) seem to be missing.
Please check and add them with an example of their possible interpretation in the present
context.

The paper illustrates a new methodology to describe characteristic patterns of behaviour during
sequential and/or synchronous interactive actions. The method develops techniques borrowed
from data mining and bioinformatics to detect frequent patterns in behavioural sequences from
interacting partners and to assess how these patterns vary across individuals or changes in
interaction tasks.
The paper describes the method through a demonstration of its application to a particular
interactive situation, which is a handover interaction. Authors analyse data from 11 pairs of
individuals tested during 40 handover interactions, 20 recorded during the handover of an empty
cut and 20 during the handover of a cup full of rice (considered by authors a more difficult
condition).
Authors first describe how the method allows for describing characteristic interaction sequences
(CISs) that most often occur during the recorded handover interactions (and occurring with
frequencies higher than chance) independently from pairs and treatment (e.g. cup full or empty).
Second, they describe methods to assess which CISs are peculiar of one particular treatment or
clusters of pairs (i.e. methods to describe differences between treatments and participants in
terms of most recurrent CISs).
The methodology is original and might be of potential interest for research on interaction.
My only concern refers to the quality of information one might get from the reported analysis.
Indeed, results mainly depend on which behaviour states are initially selected to identify
behavioural state sequences. In the example reported in the paper, for instance, authors find that
participants never looked at the partner's face during the handover interaction. However, it
might well be that they looked at the partner's hand before he/she grasped the object, yet this has
not been assessed in the reported analysis. More generally, I suggest that this method might
benefit from finding a more objective and automated way to select initial behavioural states (e.g.,
based on objective coding of where participants are looking at analysing pilot data).
As a matter of fact, the cluster analysis reported in paragraph 4.2. seems to somehow contradict
the finding reported at paragraph 4.1., which indicates that the two different treatments are
characterized by different CISs. I understand the two paragraphs report qualitatively different
analyses that cannot be directly compared; however, the cluster analysis seems to indirectly
9
suggest that there are no consistent differences between vectors from the E or F condition, as they
are equally contained in cluster alpha or in other clusters, thus suggesting that differences
between pairs have a stronger impact than treatments. Please comment on this. To me, this might
be the case because, for instance, the selected behavioural states do not really capture what
characterizes the difference between handing over a full vs. empty cup.
Finally, I suggest authors to revise the abstract, because I do not think the method described in
the paper can really say anything about "cues and prompt" that structure an interaction (line 15-
16). Indeed, the terms seem to refer to behaviours that (causally) trigger a partner's behaviour
(e.g. looking at an object to make the partner also look at the same object during shared attention
exchanges), yet the causal link between partners' behaviours is not analysed in the paper. This
has instead been done by different approaches (see for instance the study by Candidi et al. quoted
below at point 1). I suggest a better definition of what the method describes is provided by
authors themselves in the discussion when they say it allows for describing frequently occurring
behavioural patterns and thus provides a taxonomy of interactive situations (line 659).
Minor points:
1) In the Introduction at line 40 authors refer to studies describing characteristic patterns of cues
and prompts that occur during social interaction. Here they might want to refer to studies on
signalling, which is a key behavioural strategy to facilitate interpersonal coordination by using
kinematics cues that has been now well-reported in joint action literature:
Sacheli et al. 2013 "Kinematics fingerprints of leader and follower role-taking during cooperative
joint actions" Exp Brain Res 226(4):473-86; Vesper & Richanrdson 2014 "Strategic communication
and behavioral coupling in asymmetric joint action" Exp Brain Res 232(9):2945-56; Candidi et al.
2015 "Interactional leader-follower sensorimotor communication strategies during repetitive joint
actions" J R Soc Interface 12(110):0644; Vesper et al. 2016 " The role of shared visual information
for joint action coordination" Cognition 153:118-23.
2) Why CISs occurring with frequencies not significantly higher than chance are included (line
357-360)?
3) I suggest to clarify at Line 211 explain that the number "14" here refers to the fact one
participant is carrying out behaviours 4+1.

The paper illustrates a new methodology to describe characteristic patterns of behaviour during
sequential and/or synchronous interactive actions. The method develops techniques borrowed
13
from data mining and bioinformatics to detect frequent patterns in behavioural sequences from
interacting partners and to assess how these patterns vary across individuals or changes in
interaction tasks.
The paper describes the method through a demonstration of its application to a particular
interactive situation, which is a handover interaction. Authors analyse data from 11 pairs of
individuals tested during 40 handover interactions, 20 recorded during the handover of an empty
cut and 20 during the handover of a cup full of rice (considered by authors a more difficult
condition).
Authors first describe how the method allows for describing characteristic interaction sequences
(CISs) that most often occur during the recorded handover interactions (and occurring with
frequencies higher than chance) independently from pairs and treatment (e.g. cup full or empty).
Second, they describe methods to assess which CISs are peculiar of one particular treatment or
clusters of pairs (i.e. methods to describe differences between treatments and participants in
terms of most recurrent CISs).
The methodology is original and might be of potential interest for research on interaction.
My only concern refers to the quality of information one might get from the reported analysis.
Indeed, results mainly depend on which behaviour states are initially selected to identify
behavioural state sequences. In the example reported in the paper, for instance, authors find that
participants never looked at the partner's face during the handover interaction. However, it
might well be that they looked at the partner's hand before he/she grasped the object, yet this has
not been assessed in the reported analysis. More generally, I suggest that this method might
benefit from finding a more objective and automated way to select initial behavioural states (e.g.,
based on objective coding of where participants are looking at analysing pilot data).
As a matter of fact, the cluster analysis reported in paragraph 4.2. seems to somehow contradict
the finding reported at paragraph 4.1., which indicates that the two different treatments are
characterized by different CISs. I understand the two paragraphs report qualitatively different
analyses that cannot be directly compared; however, the cluster analysis seems to indirectly
suggest that there are no consistent differences between vectors from the E or F condition, as they
are equally contained in cluster alpha or in other clusters, thus suggesting that differences
between pairs have a stronger impact than treatments. Please comment on this. To me, this might
be the case because, for instance, the selected behavioural states do not really capture what
characterizes the difference between handing over a full vs. empty cup.
Finally, I suggest authors to revise the abstract, because I do not think the method described in
the paper can really say anything about "cues and prompt" that structure an interaction (line 15-
16). Indeed, the terms seem to refer to behaviours that (causally) trigger a partner's behaviour
(e.g. looking at an object to make the partner also look at the same object during shared attention
exchanges), yet the causal link between partners' behaviours is not analysed in the paper. This
has instead been done by different approaches (see for instance the study by Candidi et al. quoted
below at point 1). I suggest a better definition of what the method describes is provided by
authors themselves in the discussion when they say it allows for describing frequently occurring
behavioural patterns and thus provides a taxonomy of interactive situations (line 659).
Minor points:
1) In the Introduction at line 40 authors refer to studies describing characteristic patterns of cues
and prompts that occur during social interaction. Here they might want to refer to studies on
signalling, which is a key behavioural strategy to facilitate interpersonal coordination by using
kinematics cues that has been now well-reported in joint action literature:

joint actions" Exp Brain Res 226(4):473-86; Vesper & Richanrdson 2014 "Strategic communication

We would like to thank the editor and both reviewers for the time and effort spent in considering our
work and their invaluable comments which give us the opportunity to improve our manuscript
substantially.
We were pleased to hear that, in principle, reviewer 1 finds our study interesting and that reviewer 2
suggests our work could be a useful contribution. The substantial criticisms of the reviewers mainly
relate to our experimental methodology and to our presentation and contextualisation of methods and
experimental findings.
In response to these comments, we have comprehensively re-written our manuscript. As also
explained below, we think our data and findings on handover interactions do advance the general
understanding of social interactions. However, we acknowledge the limitations in our experimental
data pointed out by the reviewers and have therefore followed the reviewers’ advice to refocus our
revised manuscript on the methodological contribution of our work. In the revision, we have taken
particular care to explain, motivate and justify the different steps in our analysis. To ensure that our
methods are clear and reproducible, we now also include R-code implementing our algorithms for
pattern detection as supplementary information.
When making these revisions, we noticed that we had applied some of the procedures for determining
characteristic interaction patterns in a different order to what we described in the manuscript.
Specifically, we erroneously only removed sequences with identical consecutive elements at the very
end of the analysis. Correcting this led to a higher number of detected characteristic interaction
patterns and therefore affected most results we present. Most findings in our corrected analysis are
qualitatively identical to the ones originally presented, with the exception of figure 2B (clustering
according to participant pairs).
Please find our detailed responses to the reviewers’ comments below. We hope the changes we have
made are appropriate and that the manuscript is now suitable for publication in Royal Society Open
Science.
Yours sincerely,
Nikolai Bode, Andrew Sutton, Lindsey Lacey, John G. Fennell and Ute Leonards
