I have finished reading the manuscript entitled « Divergent co-evolutionary trajectories in parent-
offspring interactions revealed by interspecific cross-fostering in burying beetles ». In this study,
the authors conduct a cross-fostering experiment among 3 species of burying beetles, in which the
importance of maternal care ranges from obligatory to facultative. They measured the survival
rate of the resulting larvae, as well as their body mass at dispersal. The results overall reveal that
survival rates are higher with larvae reared by homospecific compared to heterospecific parents,
just as the body mass. Moreover, they also reveal that larvae reared by N. vespilloides parents
exhibit the same body mass, independent of their own species. Overall, I found the study well
written and I liked the general idea of this experiment. However, I have an important concern
regarding the predictions of this experimental design regarding co-adaptation and
discrimination.
MAJOR CONCERN
The main goal of this study is to shed light on potential co-adaptations between parents and
young across 3 species of burying beetles (as suggested by the title and emphasized in the
introduction). A classical method to reveal parent-offspring co-adaptation is to experimentally
disrupt families and test whether offspring (or parents) perform less well in mismatched
conditions. If a parent-offspring co-adaptation occurs in the 3 tested burying beetles, it is
predicted that larvae should survive less well and weigh less when reared by parents from
another compared to their own species. The presented results support this prediction. However,
the presented results also support another scenario that is independent of co-adaptation:
discrimination (L83-98). If parents discriminate against offspring from other species, it is
predicted that larvae should survive less well and weigh less when reared by parents from
another compared to their own species. The outcome could be larvae death, but not necessarily.
The presented results also support this prediction. Hence, the experimental design cannot allow
disentangling between these two scenarios and thus make it very difficult to understand whether
there are any co-adaptation going on in this system, or whether this is simply a matter of
discrimination. I recommend the authors to deeply edit the title, abstract and introduction to
make immediately clear(er) that the two scenarios are at the same level and emphasize that there
are both tested simultaneously in this study. The discussion – although less biased – should also
be edited to not over-interpret the results in terms of co-adaptation.
MINOR CONCERNS
L37-38: I am not sure how your study tests whether parental care is adaptive within each species.
L38-39: It is not only co-adaptation. You actually only mention the recognition scenario at the end
of the abstract, whereas it is as likely as coadaptation to explain your results.
L42: For clarity, I would suggest editing the sentence into “Overall, these results indicate that …”
L177: You standardised to 15 larvae, but how did you do so? Did you remove larvae from all the
clutches you have used (i.e. clutches were reduced to 15 larvae), did you mix clutches (i.e.
clutches were pooled to reach 15 larvae), or did you do both? Did you use the same process for
the three tested species?
L180-190: This part is difficult to follow and would benefit from being presented in a table.
Moreover, I think that there is a mistake in L185, where it should be written “N. pustulatus
3
parents with N. orbicollis larvae (n = 16)” – otherwise it is the same combination than the one
presented L181-182.
L230-233: I have had a hard time understanding the statistical process. One way to improve it
could be to change the sentence into “Our experiment procedure provided 2 data sets, each
reflecting a 2x2 factorial design. The first data set contains crosses between N. orbicollis and N.
pustulatus, whereas the second data set contains crosses between N. pustulatus and N.
vespilloides. In each of these data set, we used generalized linear models (GLMs) followed by
post-hos Tukey comparisons,…”
L228-244: If I get it right, the control with N. pustulatus has been used in the two differents
models. Wouldn’t it be necessary to correct for multiple testing then?
L136: since the clutches were standardised to 15, there is no need to do stats on proportion, but it
would be better to do it directly on the absolute number of surviving larvae.
L262-268: This should not be tested with a 2-way GLM without interaction (because it would
induce an important bias for one treatment), but instead with a 1-way GLM with three levels.
Figures 1-4: if you conduct parametrical statistics (i.e. based on mean and variances), it would be
more informative to illustrate the results with figures showing the mean and variances. However,
you used boxplots, which only present median and interquartile ranges.

label_comment_2
This paper (RSOS-180189) examines the coevolution of parent and offspring in three species of
burying beetle using cross-fostering experiments. Evidence was found for species-specific
coadaptation, including greater survival and weight gain of larvae that were reared by a parent of
their own species rather than by a parent of a congener. It was also determined that one species
had the ability to eliminate congeneric offspring of a potential brood parasite, at least when the
entire brood was of the potential parasite.
4
The experiments are straightforward and easy to interpret. I have only minor comments.
It is unlikely that pustulatus is a specialized brood parasite of orbicollis (line 400) as pustulatus
has been found to only breed in the wild using snake eggs as a resource. As mentioned in line
402, orbicollis was found to be parasitized by a different species of burying beetle in another
study. In that study there was greater opportunity for pustulatus to parasitize orbicollis (in terms
of overlap in breeding phenology), but this was not found. It is possible that orbicollis’ ability to
discriminate against pustulatus brood parasitism is the result of previous exposure to parasitism
pressure, but there is no evidence that this is presently important.
1. Lines 56-62. It should be clearer what the point of the blue tit study is to the present study. Is it
that coadaptation between parent and offspring (in this case a specific coadaptation between the
sex of a parent and offspring) can occur and be adaptive?
2. Fig. 3. The authors address why vespilloides parents caring for pustulatus broods do poorly
overall (lines 350-363) but not why there is so much variation in brood success with this
combination. Is it possible that some vespilloides exhibited a degree of parasitism resistance? As
the authors point out, even if vespilloides parents ignored the pustulatus brood, pustulatus
success would likely have been higher. Transferring mismatched oral secretions or microbiota
does not seem to explain why some pustulatus broods did quite well.
3. Line 323. Perhaps ‘increases’ rather than ‘maximizes’.
4. Line 348. Is it known that vespilloides parents provide more food than pustulatus parents or
was it found that feeding rates were higher? (Were actual volumes of regurgitation measured?)
5. Line 397. … and in the same woodland habitats.
6. Line 50. Delete ‘reciprocal’? ‘Interaction’ implies ‘reciprocal’ unless the meaning was to imply
that each party gives the same as it receives, which I do not believe was the intent.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Kristina Sefc):
This report of reduced larval fitness in interspecific cross-fostering experiments is introduced in
the framework of the parent-offspring co-adaptation hypothesis. One reviewer criticizes that the
study design does not allow to distinguish between co-adaptation and discrimination as potential
causes for the observed reduction in the fitness of cross-reared offspring. This seems indeed to be
the case. Although the authors discuss both possibilities, they do not explicitly address the
impossibility to distinguish between the two mechanisms within the present study; rather, it
appears that the outcomes of some cross-fostering combinations are explained by co-adaptation;
and others by discrimination. If the authors argue that their study design allows them to
discriminate between the scenarios, I ask them to clearly specify the predictions of each scenario
and state how each of the cross-fostering species combinations fulfills (or doesn’t) the specified
predictions. If, however, a discrimination of hypothesis is indeed impossible, please follow the
reviewer’s suggestion and revise all parts of the manuscript to reflect that both scenarios are
equally possible and simultaneously tested.
7
Data on parental behavior would perhaps be useful to identify parental discrimination of
heterospecific larvae – for instance, by comparing the parents’ response rate to begging between
the heterospecific and the conspecific treatment. Looking for this type of information, I noticed
that the sections 2.2.2. (line 207) and 3.3 (line 292), both titled “Behavior of parental N. orbicollis
towards larval N. pustulatus”, are not really concerned with data on behavior (except for the
observation of carcass re-closure, line 295) but rather on larval weight and survival rates. This
should be better reflected by the section headings.
I also noticed that the discussion does not differentiate between intraspecific discrimination (kin
recognition) and interspecific discrimination (species recognition; lines 386 onwards). It should be
possible to find examples of interspecific discrimination which would better match the situation
of this study.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
I have previously reviewed this manuscript and had only minor comments. The revision
addresses those concerns. A few additional matters have come up.
Lines 376-379. A difference in microbial communities for N. pustulatus and N. vespilloides might
indeed be expected (and hence a parent-offspring mismatch in cross-fostering) because these two
species utilize different food sources for their young, snake eggs versus a small vertebrate
carcass. Because orbicollis and vespilloides (and every other species of Nicrophorus studied) use
the same larval food source, there may be less of a mismatch, as found by Benowitz et al. (and not
studied in the present work). It may be too soon to conclude definitively that there is parent-
offspring species-specific coadaptation for Nicrophorus species that utilize the same larval food.
A similar reasoning would apply to oral/anal secretions, etc.
The proportion of pustulatus larvae eliminated by orbicollis was greatest for the only-pustulatus
larvae treatment and least for the 8 pustulatus/8 orbicollis larvae treatment, with 13 pustulatus/3
orbicollis being intermediate. This suggests that the more exposure that an orbicollis parent has to
11
orbicollis larvae, the more likely it is to accept pustulatus larvae. When there are a large number
of species-appropriate cues present, it may pay parents to be less discriminating to avoid
unnecessary killing of their own young. Alternatively, the mixing of orbicollis and pustulatus
larvae may transfer some cues between species making it impossible for the parent to
discriminate against some individuals.
Lines 346-349. In the Benowitz et al study, evidence of no coadaptation would have been reflected
by a non-significant interaction term, not the lack of significance of a main effect.

I have previously reviewed this manuscript and had only minor comments. The revision
addresses those concerns. A few additional matters have come up.
Lines 376-379. A difference in microbial communities for N. pustulatus and N. vespilloides might
indeed be expected (and hence a parent-offspring mismatch in cross-fostering) because these two
species utilize different food sources for their young, snake eggs versus a small vertebrate
carcass. Because orbicollis and vespilloides (and every other species of Nicrophorus studied) use
the same larval food source, there may be less of a mismatch, as found by Benowitz et al. (and not
studied in the present work). It may be too soon to conclude definitively that there is parent-
offspring species-specific coadaptation for Nicrophorus species that utilize the same larval food.
A similar reasoning would apply to oral/anal secretions, etc.
The proportion of pustulatus larvae eliminated by orbicollis was greatest for the only-pustulatus
larvae treatment and least for the 8 pustulatus/8 orbicollis larvae treatment, with 13 pustulatus/3
orbicollis being intermediate. This suggests that the more exposure that an orbicollis parent has to
orbicollis larvae, the more likely it is to accept pustulatus larvae. When there are a large number
of species-appropriate cues present, it may pay parents to be less discriminating to avoid
unnecessary killing of their own young. Alternatively, the mixing of orbicollis and pustulatus
larvae may transfer some cues between species making it impossible for the parent to
discriminate against some individuals.
Lines 346-349. In the Benowitz et al study, evidence of no coadaptation would have been reflected
by a non-significant interaction term, not the lack of significance of a main effect.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Kristina Sefc):
This report of reduced larval fitness in interspecific cross-fostering experiments is
ntroduced in the framework of the parent-offspring co-adaptation hypothesis. One
eviewer criticizes that the study design does not allow to distinguish between co-
adaptation and discrimination as potential causes for the observed reduction in the
itness of cross-reared offspring. This seems indeed to be the case. Although the authors
discuss both possibilities, they do not explicitly address the impossibility to distinguish
between the two mechanisms within the present study; rather, it appears that the
outcomes of some cross-fostering combinations are explained by co-adaptation; and
others by discrimination. If the authors argue that their study design allows them to
discriminate between the scenarios, I ask them to clearly specify the predictions of each
cenario and state how each of the cross-fostering species combinations fulfills (or
doesn’t) the specified predictions. If, however, a discrimination of hypothesis is indeed
mpossible, please follow the reviewer’s suggestion and revise all parts of the manuscript
o reflect that both scenarios are equally possible and simultaneously tested.
We thank the associate editor for the helpful comments and suggestions on our manuscript.
We apologize for not clearly specifying the predictions for each scenario (i.e. coadaptation
nd discrimination). In the revised manuscript, we now state our predictions (Introduction
ines 145-157), and explain how each of our parent-offspring combination fulfils the specified
predictions (Discussion lines 323-340; 446-462). Below (see comments to Joël Meunier), we
xplain in more detail how and why it might be possible to distinguish between discrimination
nd coadaptation.
Data on parental behavior would perhaps be useful to identify parental discrimination
of heterospecific larvae, for instance, by comparing the parents’ response rate to
begging between the heterospecific and the conspecific treatment. Looking for this type
of information, I noticed that the sections 2.2.2. (line 207) and 3.3 (line 292), both titled
Behavior of parental N. orbicollis towards larval N. pustulatus’, are not really
oncerned with data on behavior (except for the observation of carcass re-closure, line
295) but rather on larval weight and survival rates. This should be better reflected by
he section headings.
We thank the associate editor for this suggestion. We agree that this kind of experiment might
present an interesting avenue for future research. We apologize for the misleading section
heading, which we now have changed to: ‘Survival of larval N. pustulatus when reared in
pure or mixed-species broods by parental N. orbicollis’
also noticed that the discussion does not differentiate between intraspecific
discrimination (kin recognition) and interspecific discrimination (species recognition;
ines 386 onwards). It should be possible to find examples of interspecific discrimination
which would better match the situation of this study.
We fully agree, and have now included a study that is a more appropriate example of
nterspecific discrimination (lines 417-420).
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
have finished reading the manuscript entitled « Divergent co-evolutionary trajectories
n parent-offspring interactions revealed by interspecific cross-fostering in burying
beetles ». In this study, the authors conduct a cross-fostering experiment among 3
pecies of burying beetles, in which the importance of maternal care ranges from
obligatory to facultative. They measured the survival rate of the resulting larvae, as well
as their body mass at dispersal. The results overall reveal that survival rates are higher
with larvae reared by homospecific compared to heterospecific parents, just as the body
mass. Moreover, they also reveal that larvae reared by N. vespilloides parents exhibit
he same body mass, independent of their own species. Overall, I found the study well
ritten and I liked the general idea of this experiment. However, I have an important
oncern regarding the predictions of this experimental design regarding co-adaptation
nd discrimination.
e thank the reviewer for the positive assessment of our manuscript. We hope that our
evisions eliminate much of the major concern regarding the interpretation of our
xperiments. In fact, the comments made us aware of the poor job we did in explaining our
redictions in the previous version, and we think that the manuscript has now been much
mproved.
ajor concern
he main goal of this study is to shed light on potential co-adaptations between parents
nd young across 3 species of burying beetles (as suggested by the title and emphasized
n the introduction). A classical method to reveal parent-offspring co-adaptation is to
xperimentally disrupt families and test whether offspring (or parents) perform less well
n mismatched conditions. If a parent-offspring co-adaptation occurs in the 3 tested
urying beetles, it is predicted that larvae should survive less well and weigh less when
eared by parents from another compared to their own species. The presented results
upport this prediction. However, the presented results also support another scenario
hat is independent of co-adaptation: discrimination (L83-98). If parents discriminate
gainst offspring from other species, it is predicted that larvae should survive less well
nd weigh less when reared by parents from another compared to their own species. The
utcome could be larvae death, but not necessarily. The presented results also support
his prediction. Hence, the experimental design cannot allow disentangling between
hese two scenarios and thus make it very difficult to understand whether there are any
o-adaptation going on in this system, or whether this is simply a matter of
iscrimination. I recommend the authors to deeply edit the title, abstract and
ntroduction to make immediately clear(er) that the two scenarios are at the same level
nd emphasize that there are both tested simultaneously in this study. The discussion,
lthough less biased, should also be edited to not over-interpret the results in terms of
o-adaptation.
e appreciate the reviewer’s concern regarding the interpretation of our experiments, and we
gree that we failed to clarify how we distinguished between the two scenarios. However, as
uggested by the Associate Editor, we have now specified the predictions for each scenario
.e. coadaptation and discrimination) (Introduction lines 145-157), and how each of our
arent-offspring combination fulfils the specified predictions (Discussion lines 323-340; 446-
62). We agree that in other systems it might not be possible to distinguish between
iscrimination and coadaptation, but this is different in burying beetles. Parents of all burying
eetles studied to date (including the three species used in our study) have evolved the
trategy to consume larvae for which they are unwilling to care. They kill all of the larvae that
rrive on the carcass before their own larvae have hatched. In addition, they cull larvae
hrough filial cannibalism to adjust brood size to the carcass size. Consequently, when they
re able to discriminate between interspecific brood parasites and their own young, we predict
hat they should kill all of them. The prediction outlined by the reviewer that discrimination
ould result in lower survival and lower mass might be feasible in other systems, but it is
ighly unlikely in burying beetles. The larvae consume the carcass entirely. Leaving them
live would mean that the adults lose a valuable resource and time. We would only predict
hat they should remain with them if they had no means of killing them and that the resource
r territory was of such high value that abandonment would incur significant costs. Thus,
when some of the burying beetle larvae survived, but experienced greater fitness loss when
eared by heterospecific than by conspecific parents, we attributed the results to coadaptation.
As recommended, we edited the title, the abstract, and clearly stated our predictions in the
ntroduction (see line 145-157). We also edited the Discussion so as to better clarify that both
oadaptation and discrimination are addressed in our. We attempt to avoid over-interpreting
he results in favour of one or the other process, but rather attribute the predicted scenarios to
ach of our species combinations study (see e.g. line 323-340; line 366-373 or 446-464). We
hope that these amendments meet the reviewer’s expectations.
Minor concerns
L37-38: I am not sure how your study tests whether parental care is adaptive within
ach species.
We agree, and have amended this part of the abstract.
L38-39: It is not only co-adaptation. You actually only mention the recognition scenario
at the end of the abstract, whereas it is as likely as coadaptation to explain your results.
We have now clarified that we address both aspects equally (i.e. coadaptation and
discrimination) in our study (lines 37-40).
L42: For clarity, I would suggest editing the sentence into ’Overall, these results indicate
hat’
We agree, and have changed the wording accordingly.
L177: You standardised to 15 larvae, but how did you do so? Did you remove larvae
rom all the clutches you have used (i.e. clutches were reduced to 15 larvae), did you mix
lutches (i.e. clutches were pooled to reach 15 larvae), or did you do both? Did you use
he same process for the three tested species?
We apologize for this vagueness. We have now included this information in the methods
ection (lines 190-194). Larvae were pooled in each treatment and species. This is a standard
procedure that we have previously used, and has been used by other investigators studying
burying beetles (see e.g. Rauter & Moore 1999, 2004; Smiseth & Moore 2004; Arce et al.
2012; Capodeanu-Nägler et al. 2016).
L180-190: This part is difficult to follow and would benefit from being presented in a
able. Moreover, I think that there is a mistake in L185, where it should be written ‘N.
pustulatus parents with N. orbicollis larvae (n = 16)’? Otherwise it is the same
ombination than the one presented L181-182.
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have now provided the details on our parent-
offspring combinations in Table 1. However, the combinations we used are correctly stated in
he text. As we used N. pustulatus twice in combination with the two other species, we
stablished two controls (one control group for each combination). We have clarified this in
he methods section (lines 197-201).
L230-233: I have had a hard time understanding the statistical process. One way to
mprove it could be to change the sentence into ‘Our experiment procedure provided 2
data sets, each reflecting a 2x2 factorial design. The first data set contains crosses
between N. orbicollis and N. pustulatus, whereas the second data set contains crosses
between N. pustulatus and N. vespilloides. In each of these data set, we used generalized
inear models (GLMs) followed by post-hoc Tukey comparisons’?
We agree, and have amended this paragraph accordingly. Thank you for the suggestion.
L228-244: If I get it right, the control with N. pustulatus has been used in the two
different models. Wouldn’t it be necessary to correct for multiple testing then?
This is incorrect. We had a separate control for N. pustulatus in both of the combinations to
void multiple testing. The cross-fostering experiments are very time-consuming, and could
not, therefore, be performed simultaneously. Thus, for each experimental treatment we
stablished one control group.
L136: since the clutches were standardised to 15, there is no need to do stats on
proportion, but it would be better to do it directly on the absolute number of surviving
arvae.
We agree, and have reanalysed the data using absolute numbers of surviving larvae. However,
he results remained the same regarding statistical significance.
L262-268: This should not be tested with a 2-way GLM without interaction (because it
would induce an important bias for one treatment), but instead with a 1-way GLM with
hree levels.
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have redone this aspect of the statistical
nalysis accordingly. The results do not qualitatively change.
Figures 1-4: if you conduct parametrical statistics (i.e. based on mean and variances), it
would be more informative to illustrate the results with figures showing the mean and
variances. However, you used boxplots, which only present median and interquartile
anges.
We agree with the reviewer for the results of larval masses, and, therefore, have revised the
igures (Fig. 2, Fig. 4), which now show the mean and ± 95% confidence intervals. However,
or larval survival we used a quasi-Poisson distribution, not a Gaussian distribution. Thus, we
etained the figures in their current form (Fig.1, Fig. 3).

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper (RSOS-180189) examines the coevolution of parent and offspring in three
pecies of burying beetle using cross-fostering experiments. Evidence was found for
pecies-specific coadaptation, including greater survival and weight gain of larvae that
were reared by a parent of their own species rather than by a parent of a congener. It
was also determined that one species had the ability to eliminate congeneric offspring of
a potential brood parasite, at least when the entire brood was of the potential parasite.
The experiments are straightforward and easy to interpret. I have only minor
omments.
We thank the reviewer for his positive assessment of our manuscript.
t is unlikely that pustulatus is a specialized brood parasite of orbicollis (line 400) as
pustulatus has been found to only breed in the wild using snake eggs as a resource. As
mentioned in line 402, orbicollis was found to be parasitized by a different species of
burying beetle in another study. In that study there was greater opportunity for
pustulatus to parasitize orbicollis (in terms of overlap in breeding phenology), but this
was not found. It is possible that orbicollis’ ability to discriminate against pustulatus
brood parasitism is the result of previous exposure to parasitism pressure, but there is
no evidence that this is presently important.
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now included this possibility in the
Discussion (lines 426-427).
1. Lines 56-62. It should be clearer what the point of the blue tit study is to the present
tudy. Is it that coadaptation between parent and offspring (in this case a specific
oadaptation between the sex of a parent and offspring) can occur and be adaptive?
We apologize for this vagueness, and have now pointed out the relevance of this reference to
our study (lines 64-65).
2. Fig. 3. The authors address why vespilloides parents caring for pustulatus broods do
poorly overall (lines 350-363) but not why there is so much variation in brood success
with this combination. Is it possible that some vespilloides exhibited a degree of
parasitism resistance? As the authors point out, even if vespilloides parents ignored the
pustulatus brood, pustulatus success would likely have been higher. Transferring
mismatched oral secretions or microbiota does not seem to explain why some pustulatus
broods did quite well.
We thank the reviewer for this comment. We agree, and have now considered this possibility
n the Discussion (lines 459-462).
3. Line 323. Perhaps ‘increases’ rather than ‘maximizes’.
We agree, and have changed the wording accordingly.
4. Line 348. Is it known that vespilloides parents provide more food than pustulatus
parents or was it found that feeding rates were higher? (Were actual volumes of
egurgitation measured?)
Unfortunately, we did not measure the actual volume of regurgitations (which is a very
difficult task). However, we know that feeding rates are higher in N. vespilloides than in N.
pustulatus. Thus, we have amended this sentence accordingly (lines 370-373).
5. Line 397. ‘and in the same woodland habitats.
We agree, and have included this statement.
6. Line 50. Delete ‘reciprocal’. Interaction implies ‘reciprocal’ unless the meaning was to
mply that each party gives the same as it receives, which I do not believe was the intent.
We have deleted ‘reciprocal’.

We are very grateful for the positive assessment of our revised manuscript.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
have previously reviewed this manuscript and had only minor comments. The revision addresses
those concerns. A few additional matters have come up.
Lines 376-379. A difference in microbial communities for N. pustulatus and N. vespilloides might
ndeed be expected (and hence a parent-offspring mismatch in cross-fostering) because these two
species utilize different food sources for their young, snake eggs versus a small vertebrate carcass.
Because orbicollis and vespilloides (and every other species of Nicrophorus studied) use the same
larval food source, there may be less of a mismatch, as found by Benowitz et al. (and not studied in
the present work). It may be too soon to conclude definitively that there is parent-offspring species-
specific coadaptation for Nicrophorus species that utilize the same larval food. A similar reasoning
would apply to oral/anal secretions, etc.
We are grateful for this comment, and have now included this in our Discussion (lines 377-381):
“However, we should note that these two species appear to use different food sources in nature, as
N. pustulatus has been frequently found to exploit snake eggs [53,54]. Thus, an interspecific
mismatch with respect to a species-specific microbiome or oral secretions may not apply to
Nicrophorus species that utilize small vertebrate carcasses as food source for their larvae.”
The proportion of pustulatus larvae eliminated by orbicollis was greatest for the only-pustulatus
larvae treatment and least for the 8 pustulatus/8 orbicollis larvae treatment, with 13 pustulatus/3
orbicollis being intermediate. This suggests that the more exposure that an orbicollis parent has to
orbicollis larvae, the more likely it is to accept pustulatus larvae. When there are a large number of
species-appropriate cues present, it may pay parents to be less discriminating to avoid unnecessary
killing of their own young. Alternatively, the mixing of orbicollis and pustulatus larvae may transfer
some cues between species making it impossible for the parent to discriminate against some
individuals.
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, and have now discussed this possibility in lines 439-445:
“The acceptance of N. pustulatus was highest in mixed broods with equal numbers of N. pustulatus
and N. orbicollis. This suggests that the more N. orbicollis parents are exposed to conspecific larvae,
the more likely it is that they accept N. pustulatus larvae. In the presence of large numbers of
species-appropriate cues, parents may be less discriminating to avoid unnecessary killing of own
larvae. Alternatively, the mixing of N. pustulatus and N. orbicollis larvae may have led to a transfer of
cues between species, making it impossible for parents to discriminate against individual larvae. “
Lines 346-349. In the Benowitz et al study, evidence of no coadaptation would have been reflected
by a non-significant interaction term, not the lack of significance of a main effect.
We agree, and have now changed the sentence accordingly (lines 337-341):
“In contrast, in a cross-fostering experiment involving N. orbicollis and N. vespilloides, Benowitz et
al. [34] found no evidence of species-specific coadaptation between offspring and maternal traits
(no significant interactions between caretaker and recipient species for development time or larval
mass) and attributed differences in caregiving to life-history differences between species.”
