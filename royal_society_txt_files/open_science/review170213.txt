This short paper provides much needed data on fresh water INP. It samples a single site weekly
for 16 months, enumerates the INP with a frozen drop technique with 5 and 0.22µm filtering and
also includes river discharge and precipitation data. In general the paper is clearly written but
there are a number of places where the English could be improved.

As regards the science I think it would strengthen the work if some comments were made for
periods when although there were high levels of precipitation and discharge, INP levels did not
increase. (July 2016 onwards).
The results and discussion para 2 line four “at Basel must be transported by” is over strong and

• The highest temperature INP in each sample
• The effect of heat on the INP (are they likely biological)
• Was any effort made to get surface rather than subsurface water for the analysis?

manuscript describes an analysis of the potential for river water to emit ice nucleating particles
) to the atmosphere, which is an underappreciated and potentially important source of ice
leating particles. The results are of interest, but some discussion of the data and the conclusions do
consider some key factors related to INP, freshwater, and cloud formation, which need to be
ressed before the manuscript is published. If the lack of consideration of emission is not addressed
estimate provided, which is likely an upper estimate since it does not consider fraction emitted to
atmosphere, could lead to confusion in the literature about the contribution of this source to
ospheric INP.
ments
A key assumption made throughout the paper is that ice nucleating particles is that all ice nucleating
particles are the result of biological macromolecules. Biological particles are certainly an important
source of INPs, but there are numerous other sources, as shown by Paul DeMott and many others,
including mineral dust, sea spray aerosol, some biomass burning particles, etc. The wide range of
sources of INP should be discussed and the results interpreted in light of this.
A second concerning assumption is that INPs emitted from a watershed would all be generated
externally, then transported to the river where they would be emitted. This presumes two things, 1)
that INP are conserved and 2) that INP cannot be generated from freshwater. Slade et al. 2010
showed for the Great Lakes in the U.S. that aerosols are frequently emitted and Chung et al.
modeled their emission, showing that lake-generated aerosol can be an important contributor to
aerosol concentrations. Last year, May et al. 2016 AMT showed that aerosols formed from
freshwater, even without biological content, can produce large enough particles to nucleate cloud
droplets, while Axson et al. sampled at the Lake Michigan shoreline and showed organic
components (from biological sources) mixed with salts. The freshwater-generated particles in these
4 papers may act as INP based on composition and are likely a larger source than rainwater
generated aerosol via the droplet hitting liquid mechanism of Wang et al. 2016 in Nature
Geoscience. A revised manuscript should make it clear that the potential contribution of freshwater
itself as INP, as it is likely to be far more complex than determining the concentration of INP from
the water itself.
The proposed emission mechanism of the INPs should be discussed in more detail. Simply relying on
the concentrations from water will not account for the generation mechanism (Rain? Waves? Other
sources of bubbles? Boats?), which will be a key factor for determining atmospheric concentrations.
The INP concentration in the atmosphere is proposed to be correlated with rain and discharge,
which changes the number of biological INP in the water, but minimal discussion of the meteorology
necessary to emit these particles is included. Is this going to be a function of wind speed? If it is
driven by rain rate is the intensity important? What about the impinging droplet size important? The
main concern here is that you need two factors for INP emission: 1) you need INP (which the
authors measure at least within the water as a lower limit) and 2) you need to get them into the
atmosphere. The paper is really lacking on the 2nd point, but then tries to provide an emission rate
per m2 per day. This lack of consideration about emission is a fatal flaw and could lead to issues if
published as it is likely an overestimate unless the authors can show that a large fraction of these
particles are getting into the atmosphere. Without appropriate discussion and consideration about
how and when the INP might be emitted this could lead to issues if incorporated into models.
Though the method of determining INPs has been previously published, a little bit more discussion
of the key principals involved would strengthen the manuscript.

r Editor,
nk you for your effort during the review process. Following is a point-by-point reply to the two
ewers. The comments from both reviewers were helpful for the revision of the manuscript, it
s however seem like reviewer 2 misunderstood a key aspect of the paper. Please see the opening

e” has been added in both places.
As regards the science I think it would strengthen the work if some comments were made for
ods when although there were high levels of precipitation and discharge, INP levels did not
ease. (July 2016 onwards).
m the 1. July onwards there were three precipitation events that lead to discharge
ks:14.07.2016, 06.08.2016 and 06.09.2016. The first event led to a peak in INP levels (peak nr. 7
g. 2 and Fig. 3). The second event falls into the only longer sampling gap in the measurement
od, this has been added as a note in results and discussion, para 1, line 5. The third discharge
k is most probably too small to generate a peak in INP concentration, due to the still high
wmelt-driven baseflow at the time and the relatively short time period between it and the
eding discharge peaks.
The results and discussion para 2 line four “at Basel must be transported by” is over strong
“must” should be replaced with very likely or similar.
sentence has been rewritten to account for the possibility of INP production in the freshwater
em citing Slade [23] and May [24]. “Must” has been replaced with “our data strongly suggest”.
sentence is now in results and discussion para 2, lines 5 and 6.
The occurrence of INP in the Milli-Q water used for dilutions
Milli-Q water used for dilution was tested and found to be free of INP active in the temperature
e examined in this study. This has been added to the paper as the last sentence in methods para
The highest temperature INP in each sample
highest onset of freezing was at –4 °C (24.02.2016, 10.03.2016, 31.03.2016 and 28.4.2016) and
lowest at -7.5 °C (15.10.2015). This has been added to results and discussion para 1, lines 6 and 7.
The effect of heat on the INP (are they likely biological)

temperature range of our analysis was from -2 to -10°C, well within the range of purely biological
s.
Was any effort made to get surface rather than subsurface water for the analysis
would have been interesting, however upstream weirs, bridges and the uneven sole surface of
river lead to a strong vertical mixture of the river water (the vertical water movement is easily
ervable at the water surface). We therefore assumed that the river water is vertically well mixed
did not attempt to sample surface water.

ly to reviewer 2
r reviewer,
nk you for the invested time and your feedback, our manuscript has benefited from it. We agree
ome of the comments and have made adjustments in the paper accordingly, see the point-by-
t reply below. However, there seems to have been a misunderstanding regarding a key element
he paper. The review starts with “This manuscript describes an analysis of the potential for river
er to emit ice nucleating particles”, additionally comment number three discusses “The proposed
ssion mechanism of the INPs”. What we present and discuss in the paper is the production rate of
in a watershed, not the rate at which INPs are emitted to the atmosphere. Please see the answer
omment three for details.

A key assumption made throughout the paper is that ice nucleating particles is that all ice
eating particles are the result of biological macromolecules. Biological particles are certainly an
ortant source of INPs, but there are numerous other sources, as shown by Paul DeMott and many
rs, including mineral dust, sea spray aerosol, some biomass burning particles, etc. The wide range
ources of INP should be discussed and the results interpreted in light of this.
ou correctly write, there are numerous non-biological particles that have ice nucleating abilities,
do not state otherwise. Our paper, however, is purely concerning biological INPs. We chose a
perature range for our analysis (-2 to -10°C) that is well above the temperatures where known
-biological INPs are active (Murray [1] and Atkinson [2] both conclude that the only known INPs
ve at temperatures higher than -15°C are of biological origin).
A second concerning assumption is that INPs emitted from a watershed would all be
erated externally, then transported to the river where they would be emitted. This presumes two
gs, 1) that INP are conserved and 2) that INP cannot be generated from freshwater. Slade et al.
0 showed for the Great Lakes in the U.S. that aerosols are frequently emitted and Chung et al.
eled their emission, showing that lake-generated aerosol can be an important contributor to
sol concentrations. Last year, May et al. 2016 AMT showed that aerosols formed from

uld make it clear that the potential contribution of freshwater itself as INP, as it is likely to be far
e complex than determining the concentration of INP from the water itself.
completely agree that only determining INP concentrations in freshwater will not tell us any
ils regarding water itself as a potential source. However, from our time series in combination
precipitation and river flow data we can make a logical deduction about the likely location of the
ngest source in our watershed, which is most likely outside the river; i.e. between the place
re the rain hits the watershed and the river itself. We do not assume that all INPs are generated
rnally, but our data strongly suggests that the majority of the INPs are. To make this more clear
have changed results and discussion para 2, lines 5 and 6 from:
nce, the majority of INP-8 in Rhine water at Basel must be transported by surface or subsurface
to the freshwater system.“
hough some of the INP-8 are probably produced in the freshwater system [23,24], our data
ngly suggest that the majority of INP-8 in Rhine water at Basel are transported by surface or
surface flow to the freshwater system.”
The proposed emission mechanism of the INPs should be discussed in more detail. Simply
ing on the concentrations from water will not account for the generation mechanism (Rain?
ves? Other sources of bubbles? Boats?), which will be a key factor for determining atmospheric
centrations. The INP concentration in the atmosphere is proposed to be correlated with rain and
harge, which changes the number of biological INP in the water, but minimal discussion of the
eorology necessary to emit these particles is included. Is this going to be a function of wind
ed? If it is driven by rain rate is the intensity important? What about the impinging droplet size
ortant? The main concern here is that you need two factors for INP emission: 1) you need INP
ich the authors measure at least within the water as a lower limit) and 2) you need to get them
the atmosphere. The paper is really lacking on the 2nd point, but then tries to provide an
ssion rate per m2 per day. This lack of consideration about emission is a fatal flaw and could lead
sues if published as it is likely an overestimate unless the authors can show that a large fraction
hese particles are getting into the atmosphere. Without appropriate discussion and consideration
ut how and when the INP might be emitted this could lead to issues if incorporated into models.
entioned at the start of the reply, we do not propose an emission mechanism. We propose and
uss the production rate of INP in the watershed, i.e., how many INPs are generated by the
system on the ground per unit area and time. Of course, this is not the same as the rate at which
are emitted to the atmosphere. The proposed production rate is then compared (not correlated)
he atmospheric inventory to show that the number of INPs produced within the watershed
ng a day is two orders of magnitude larger than what has been found in the air above it. To help
ent further misunderstanding we made a change to the introduction, para 2, line 7: “its lower
t” has been replaced by “the lower limit of an INP-8 production rate”
Though the method of determining INPs has been previously published, a little bit more
ussionof the key principals involved would strengthen the manuscript.
agree, it is important to be able to understand the key principals of the analysis without reading a
nd paper. We have made changes to methods para 1, lines 6-12 to better describe the analysis
hod. It now reads:
analysis the tubes were cooled in a cold bath at a rate of 0.3°C min-1 from -2 to -10°C. Freezing
detected automatically by the decrease in light transmission through the vertical axis of each
e as recorded by a camera installed above them. Four Pt1000 sensors recorded the concurrent
zing temperature. A detailed description of the apparatus can be found in Stopelli et al. [20].
en INP concentrations were so high that all tubes froze before reaching -10°C, we analysed 1:10
:100 dilutions of the sampled water. The Milli-Q water used for dilution was tested and found to
ree of INP active in the temperature range examined in this study.”
