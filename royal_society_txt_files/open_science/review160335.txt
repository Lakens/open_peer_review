Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors state that they were interested in the 'development of small scale fractures and
material cohesion loss both in the short- and long-term' effected by war-related bullet etc damage
on stone built heritage, and its effect on subsequent weathering, here treated as moisture ingress
and temperature.
1) My first concern is that the start conditions of the experiments were non-optimised for the
research context of short/long term decay patterns caused by high velocity impact damage – the
calibre and material, velocity of the air gun pellets, thickness of stone samples, and case
hardening simulation (as opposed to finding case hardened samples) are all variables and choices
that were not sufficiently explained in relation to the context of the research question.
2) There was no contextual information about the trajectories, material etc of the bullets (AK47)
nominally under examination and those of the equipment used in the experiment – AK47s use
bullets of 7.62mm hardened steel shot at 715m/s - what was the experimental expectation for the
impact results of 5.5mm soft/hollowed lead pellets shot at a velocity of approx. 362 m/s to
simulate the effects of war zone impacts? Ie. the authors could better explain the scope of their
experimental set up and its relation to the real world situations putatively under examination.
3) This is the biggest problem for this reviewer - how to relate the results with regard to
exponentially different mechanical energies effected on impact in the case of the AK47 and .22 air
rifle.
3
This is actually emphasised by the 3D model image in their Introduction of the 'sample block
remnant' after impact of an AK47 bullet which clearly shows major cracks (btw there is no
information as to where the image/remnant came from) and not just the 'development of small
scale fractures'.
Obviously, both cracks and fractures are active on the subsequent decay of such disrupted stone
morphology.
4) This disjuncture between context/research question and methodology/methods is
compounded by the appearance that the experiments seem to have been contingent on what
time/resources were available and are not optimised for addressing the 'what' of the research.
For example, were the samples cut to the 75mm thickness before or after range enquiries for
fullbore shooting (typically 7.65mm NATO or .308 (7.8mm) diameter rounds) were exhausted
and the .22 air rifle selected?
5) Having said all that, if we take the experiments at face value, that they were designed to
examine only the 'development of small scale fractures and material cohesion loss both in the
short- and long-term' from lower velocity impacts, rather than in conjunction with those larger
scale crack networks from high velocity impacts - then they can be considered in themselves as
the experimental set up would appear to match such a premise. Btw. this would perhaps give a
little more coherence for including section 3.5.4 on the .22 lead deposition (which otherwise
seems redundant given the research question).
However, this would mean that the authors should strip away much of the context to war torn
zones and high velocity bullet/shrapnel impacts from their Intro as the scope of the work is more
modest – which means reframing the 'why' of the research more clearly and closely to what was
actually tested and what it might lead to in the Intro. - ie. simply recharacterizing it as a pilot
study to help ground work for further research.
6) Discussion – the meteorite discussion feels a bit misplaced given the 'container' of being useful
for further studies of 'arms induced damage' and the caveated .22 test its discussed against. It
would possibly be better retained for use with any further research into high velocity impacts
from shrapnel/AK47s.
The rest of the discussion on moisture movement and compaction is clear with no drift in
language to conflate silane-treated surfaces with case-hardened surfaces.
7) However and rather unfortunately in the speculations highlighted on 2nd paragraph p23
comparing risks around the use of consolidation/case hardening the reverse conflation occurs -
silanes are not applied as in the tests here so any comparison with case hardening (simulated or
'proper') would need careful argument to back it up before such an assertion, however vague, can
be made about increased deterioration risk.
The rest of p23 to the end of the Discussion could be tempered a bit more and more closely
related to the more modest Concluding Remarks given the scale of the impacts and
morphological disruptions studied.
Technical queries:
Apart from this reviewers view on the disjuncture between the 'why' and 'how' of the research,
there are also a couple of details not clearly explained/omitted or needing expansion especially if
re-drafting the paper around low velocity impacts:
A) “Half these samples were treated with consolidant, mimicing natural surface
cementation”[sic]
4
The treatment with the alkoxysilane is only half explained with no detail on its cure time. To see
it examined in thin section would have been useful – ie. did the OH100 gel quickly? If it did in an
hour or less (this would be quite unusual) then perhaps it would effect something similar to case
hardening in sandstones – I think the authors need to explain a little more of the simulation
technique and comparison with any examination of 'proper' case hardened sandstone.
In relation, was the XRD performed on sample 1 before the other samples were treated with
silane? Given the analysis on p11/18 re. deformation/realignment of clays post-impact that the
same deformation patterns in the clays are found across treated and non-treated samples a line
should be added to explain how this also ensures there is no possibility of the clays being
deformed by the silane itself ie. silanes are known to deform some clay minerals through
intercrystalline and osmosic swelling re. any polar liquids.
It would be nice to see where the silane is in relation to any deformations in the figures. I first
read the foot of p 19 as meaning that this was indicated in fig 15 because of the XRT being used
'to map out consolidation and fracture zones' -whereas you really mean 'compaction' zones.
Btw. the figure captions could indicate whether the sample has been shot/treated or not too
make it easier for the reader
Perhaps the use of silane as a simulation impacted (ha!) the inversion of hardness as described
p12 and if this inversion would occur in a 'proper' case-hardened sample?
In other words I'd be wary of any Discussion (cf. p20) in relation to 'proper' case-hardening from
the tests (see point 1 above) as 2 distinct phenomena are in danger of being conflated where only
1 (silane) has been tested, even if the literature backs the general point made (eg. Momber;
Wheeler).
B) re. 'post Impact test' – I wondered why there were no controls: untreated/unshot water
immersed and treated un-shot water immersed with regard to comparisons with 3&4 and 7&8
given that the tests were designed to further the hypothesis that increased evaporation from
damaged areas accelerates deterioration. There is also a drift (p8) in language to suggest that the
tests can say something about the hypothesis in relation to case-hardened stones when the
samples are simulations of case-hardening.
C) p9 did the authors had looked at impact studies on concrete? An image of the experimental set
up for the ERT would be good to see.
D) v. minor point - p4. Where the authors state that 'impact' is not part of any classification
documents they omit to reference the widely accepted CCI's '10 agents of deterioration' where it
is included under Agent 1; physical forces cf. http://canada.p ch.gc.ca/eng/1444924113472
though very generally.
Editorial notes:
I) p7. Fig. 2 it is difficult to distinguish the black dotted lines from the the white horizontal lines
of the lo-res image. Making the 16 squares difficult to see.
II) Finally, there are some typos/mispellings eg. 'mimicking' ; p13 'apparently' should be
'apparent' …. and I noticed one mis-attribution – on p6. Kemp 2015 should be Kemp 2006

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_5
You have addressed most of my comments and the Discussion and Conclusion are much better.
I still have some slight reservations about the methodology althoug these are now fully explained
- I was however disappointed that the reason AK47 bullets weren't used was because of having
had the test samples cut/made _before_ allowing for their proper specification 9see below) ...
10
BTW. I know from what you have said that the data will be made available for publication and
have thus answered 'yes' to the relevant questions about its availability on my reviewers form,
although all the data as I was sent is currently not included in the 'supplementary files' other
than the AK47 impact model..
Detailed comments:
1)Figure 1 on p3. still needs explanation of where its from so the reader understands it WAS part
of your study! Strangely Fig1 also appears on p6 - surely some mistake?!
2) The line on p5 explaining why you scaled down to a .22, - 'the extent of destruction wrought by
the AK47 impact on our sample blocks ensured the remaining fragments were not suitable
for a full examination of the interactions between impact sites, surrounding fracture networks
and any unharmed material in the periphery' - kind of gets to the point I made in my original
review - it sounds like the blocks were cut to size first and then shot at with a) AK47 b) .22 and
then you abandoned using the AK47 as it caused 'too' much damage to the precut sample blocks
you had, rather than simply getting bigger blocks!
That was my question in my original review, which came first, the blocks or the calibre
choice?..and unfortunately its seems the pre-cut blocks forced the decision, which I feel
methodologically/in terms of the research question was the wrong decision - this is somewhat
compounded by the final line: 'Whilst this discrepancy in scales must be noted, here we lay the
methodological foundations for future investigations of larger impacts, and highlight the
pressing need for further research in to endangered built heritage.' ie. a missed opportunity...
3) p4 line 18 - re. ' Canadian Conservation Institute Agent 1 risk listings of catastrophic forces
(CCI, no date),' - these are more familiar as the 'Ten agents of Deterioration' and were drawn up
originally as 9 by Stefan Michalski in 1994 and a tenth (custodial neglect) was added by Robert
Waller in 1995....
4) p5 line 10 - too many 'artificially' s
5) p6. 'The results presented here highlight that the impact of bullets on stone surfaces is
not a
straightforward creation of an impact fracture network but is dictated by the stone’s ability to
process the influx of stress associated with the impact as well as pre-existing alteration of the
stone' - perhaps more simply put - that pre-existing stress patterns influence any impact fracture
networks ?
6) p7 re. '1.1 Stone samples' - it is now apparent that the samples were cut before any testing to
determine sample size was made with an AK47 ....as above, I think this was an avoidable error.
7) line 56 - infestation, not investation ....
8) not so important but Fig 3 perhaps better as just the enhanced version?? and larger as a bit
difficult to see ...
9) p12 line 34 - decrease not 'decease'
10) p16 'The presence or absence of a fracture network developed at the time of impact' - needs
rephrasing to make clearer given what you go on to say - something like the presence or absence
of any pre-existing stresses in the substrate ??
11) you say 'cavernous' I say 'alveolar' !!
12) p16 line 44 - 'impact areas resulting from armed warfare' is better
11
13) p16 - last 2 sentences need rewriting as they are clumsy - also would moisture transport
distribution have been different if simulated from the back not the foot? .. Line 55 remove '(see
figure 8)'
14) lines 10-11 inconsistency in Wacker product name
15) p20 lines 17+ - this statement contradicts line 22 on p19
16) p21 - I still think this section on the deposition of lead is not relevant and should be
cut/made a a footnote unless linked to lead-based materials used in armed conflict - it is purely
contingent on the small arms you chose to use and detracts from the study of increased
weathering as a result of bullet impacts ...
17) p23 line 3 - this relates to my question in point 13) above, and the observation might be
contingent upon the way you effected moisture transport....
18) p24 line 10 - and for AK47s ??? begs the question .. also you should add-in '.22 calibre bullets'
line 54 should be '..small calibre bullet impacts...'

You have addressed most of my comments and the Discussion and Conclusion are much better.
I still have some slight reservations about the methodology althoug these are now fully explained
- I was however disappointed that the reason AK47 bullets weren't used was because of having
had the test samples cut/made _before_ allowing for their proper specification 9see below) ...
14
BTW. I know from what you have said that the data will be made available for publication and
have thus answered 'yes' to the relevant questions about its availability on my reviewers form,
although all the data as I was sent is currently not included in the 'supplementary files' other
than the AK47 impact model..
Detailed comments:
1)Figure 1 on p3. still needs explanation of where its from so the reader understands it WAS part
of your study! Strangely Fig1 also appears on p6 - surely some mistake?!
2) The line on p5 explaining why you scaled down to a .22, - 'the extent of destruction wrought by
the AK47 impact on our sample blocks ensured the remaining fragments were not suitable
for a full examination of the interactions between impact sites, surrounding fracture networks
and any unharmed material in the periphery' - kind of gets to the point I made in my original
review - it sounds like the blocks were cut to size first and then shot at with a) AK47 b) .22 and
then you abandoned using the AK47 as it caused 'too' much damage to the precut sample blocks
you had, rather than simply getting bigger blocks!
That was my question in my original review, which came first, the blocks or the calibre
choice?..and unfortunately its seems the pre-cut blocks forced the decision, which I feel
methodologically/in terms of the research question was the wrong decision - this is somewhat
compounded by the final line: 'Whilst this discrepancy in scales must be noted, here we lay the
methodological foundations for future investigations of larger impacts, and highlight the
pressing need for further research in to endangered built heritage.' ie. a missed opportunity...
3) p4 line 18 - re. ' Canadian Conservation Institute Agent 1 risk listings of catastrophic forces
(CCI, no date),' - these are more familiar as the 'Ten agents of Deterioration' and were drawn up
originally as 9 by Stefan Michalski in 1994 and a tenth (custodial neglect) was added by Robert
Waller in 1995....
4) p5 line 10 - too many 'artificially' s
5) p6. 'The results presented here highlight that the impact of bullets on stone surfaces is
not a
straightforward creation of an impact fracture network but is dictated by the stone’s ability to
process the influx of stress associated with the impact as well as pre-existing alteration of the
stone' - perhaps more simply put - that pre-existing stress patterns influence any impact fracture
networks ?
6) p7 re. '1.1 Stone samples' - it is now apparent that the samples were cut before any testing to
determine sample size was made with an AK47 ....as above, I think this was an avoidable error.
7) line 56 - infestation, not investation ....
8) not so important but Fig 3 perhaps better as just the enhanced version?? and larger as a bit
difficult to see ...
9) p12 line 34 - decrease not 'decease'
10) p16 'The presence or absence of a fracture network developed at the time of impact' - needs
rephrasing to make clearer given what you go on to say - something like the presence or absence
of any pre-existing stresses in the substrate ??
11) you say 'cavernous' I say 'alveolar' !!
12) p16 line 44 - 'impact areas resulting from armed warfare' is better
13) p16 - last 2 sentences need rewriting as they are clumsy - also would moisture transport
distribution have been different if simulated from the back not the foot? .. Line 55 remove '(see
figure 8)'
15
14) lines 10-11 inconsistency in Wacker product name
15) p20 lines 17+ - this statement contradicts line 22 on p19
16) p21 - I still think this section on the deposition of lead is not relevant and should be
cut/made a a footnote unless linked to lead-based materials used in armed conflict - it is purely
contingent on the small arms you chose to use and detracts from the study of increased
weathering as a result of bullet impacts ...
17) p23 line 3 - this relates to my question in point 13) above, and the observation might be
contingent upon the way you effected moisture transport....
18) p24 line 10 - and for AK47s ??? begs the question .. also you should add-in '.22 calibre bullets'

Only temperatures can be changed in the environmental cabinet? How about the humidity?
In this instance only temperature was changed, to address the research question ‘how does thermal
stress affect stone response post-impact?’ This study represents the first work carried out on
sandstone damage during armed conflict, which is now widely present in the Middle East. The
environmental stress was therefore focussed on the factors most likely to be dominant in these areas;
large temperature fluctuations, capillary rise of groundwater and subsequent evaporation, and case
hardening developed during prolonged exposure of the stone surface.
Reviewer: 2
First of all, we want to thank the reviewer for an excellent and thorough review of this paper. We feel
that the comments are fair and highlight a number of issues that indeed needed clarification. While
the reviewer offered a substantial number of comments and suggestions no further data collection or
analysis was required. We have therefore attempted to answer each concern as thoroughly as
possible and have amended the manuscript accordingly.
Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_10
The authors state that they were interested in the 'development of small scale fractures and
material cohesion loss both in the short- and long-term' effected by war-related bullet etc damage
on stone built heritage, and its effect on subsequent weathering, here treated as moisture ingress
and temperature.
Yes, this is correct
1) My first concern is that the start conditions of the experiments were non-optimised for the
research context of short/long term decay patterns caused by high velocity impact damage – the
calibre and material, velocity of the air gun pellets, thickness of stone samples, and case hardening
simulation (as opposed to finding case hardened samples) are all variables and choices that were not
sufficiently explained in relation to the context of the research question.
A paragraph has been added in the introduction which explains the restrictions on impact size within
the context of the study and technological restrictions.
A further paragraph was added to explain the need to investigate case hardening in the context of
heritage in armed warfare zones and the environmental stresses likely to be placed on stone
surfaces. In particular, this takes into account the high evaporation rates and capillary rise.
Finally, a section was added explaining the use of fresh samples with artificially created case
hardening rather than samples with natural case hardening. It was felt that unknown weathering
history would add an unacceptable level of variability to a study focussed on investigating individual
factors.
2) There was no contextual information about the trajectories, material etc of the bullets (AK47)
nominally under examination and those of the equipment used in the experiment – AK47s use
bullets of 7.62mm hardened steel shot at 715m/s - what was the experimental expectation for the
impact results of 5.5mm soft/hollowed lead pellets shot at a velocity of approx. 362 m/s to simulate
set up and its relation to the real world situations putatively under examination.
This is now covered in the added paragraph associated with figure 1; the AK47 impact is purely an
illustration of the potential for contemporary weapons to damage a stone surface. The paragraph
also explains that within the scope of this study the ammunition was scaled down to fit technological
restraints without compromising on the aim of the study (mapping out the response of a complete
fracture network, rather than a partial mapping of a remnant).
3) This is the biggest problem for this reviewer - how to relate the results with regard to
exponentially different mechanical energies effected on impact in the case of the AK47 and .22 air
rifle.
This is actually emphasised by the 3D model image in their Introduction of the 'sample block
remnant' after impact of an AK47 bullet which clearly shows major cracks (btw there is no
information as to where the image/remnant came from) and not just the 'development of small
scale fractures'.
Obviously, both cracks and fractures are active on the subsequent decay of such disrupted stone
morphology.
This was extensively discussed during the writing of this paper. It was felt that while the AK47 shot
provided an obvious contrast with the ammunition used in this study,, it is necessary to highlight the
scale of the issue and to place the impact study presented here within context. While this
understandably raises questions regarding the wider applicability of our results, we believe it
presents a true appraisal of the scale presented here vs the scale of damage that could be incurred,
and highlights the importance of undertaking further research on higher calibre impacts
4) This disjuncture between context/research question and methodology/methods is compounded
by the appearance that the experiments seem to have been contingent on what time/resources
were available and are not optimised for addressing the 'what' of the research. For example, were
the samples cut to the 75mm thickness before or after range enquiries for fullbore shooting
(typically 7.65mm NATO or .308 (7.8mm) diameter rounds) were exhausted and the .22 air rifle
selected?
The reviewer has addressed an issue here that has limited the scope of the study; there were
limitations to the resources available for this study. This study is intended as a ‘call to arms’, a pilot
study testing out methodologies for assessing damage. The parameters of the study (block size,
ammunition) were selected to work within the parameters of the scanner, environmental cabinet and
ERT work. This is reflected in the introductory paragraph added in response to query 1.
It is not entirely clear what the reviewer means by the cutting of the samples; all blocks were
uniformly cut to 15 x 15 x 7,5cm before shooting, as is listed in section 2.1.1.
5) Having said all that, if we take the experiments at face value, that they were designed to examine
only the 'development of small scale fractures and material cohesion loss both in the short- and
long-term' from lower velocity impacts, rather than in conjunction with those larger scale crack
networks from high velocity impacts - then they can be considered in themselves as the
experimental set up would appear to match such a premise. Btw. this would perhaps give a little
more coherence for including section 3.5.4 on the .22 lead deposition (which otherwise seems
redundant given the research question).
However, this would mean that the authors should strip away much of the context to war torn zones
and high velocity bullet/shrapnel impacts from their Intro as the scope of the work is more modest –
which means reframing the 'why' of the research more clearly and closely to what was actually
ground work for further research.
The additional paragraphs in the introduction and the adjusted text in both the discussion and
concluding remarks now reiterate the limitations on the scope of the study. However, the aim of this
research is to not only take the first steps in investigating the damage and potential long-term
consequences but also to alert the wider scientific community to the urgency of the issue. The
limitations of the study have been reiterated throughout the paper, as per the reviewer’s
suggestions, but cutting heavily down on the wider context of armed warfare would run the risk that
this target is missed. The changes made reflect the more modest scale of the experiment, yet the
context hopefully alerts readers to the need for further expansion of this work.
6) Discussion – the meteorite discussion feels a bit misplaced given the 'container' of being useful for
further studies of 'arms induced damage' and the caveated .22 test its discussed against. It would
possibly be better retained for use with any further research into high velocity impacts from
shrapnel/AK47s.
We feel that it is significant that even with the .22 tests, there are comparisons with meteorite
impact damage. The discussion also points the way forward to several other directions that can be
followed up.
The rest of the discussion on moisture movement and compaction is clear with no drift in language
to conflate silane-treated surfaces with case-hardened surfaces.
7) However and rather unfortunately in the speculations highlighted on 2nd paragraph p23
comparing risks around the use of consolidation/case hardening the reverse conflation occurs -
silanes are not applied as in the tests here so any comparison with case hardening (simulated or
'proper') would need careful argument to back it up before such an assertion, however vague, can
be made about increased deterioration risk.
Additional text has been inserted throughout the article which emphasises the role of Wacker as an
analogy for case hardening. The discussion has been altered to reflect this as well.
The rest of p23 to the end of the Discussion could be tempered a bit more and more closely related
to the more modest Concluding Remarks given the scale of the impacts and morphological
disruptions studied.
Further text has now been added to emphasise the limitations of the calibre used and multiple
suggestions for further study have been inserted to emphasise the role of this paper as a first step
and a call to arms.
Technical queries:
Apart from this reviewers view on the disjuncture between the 'why' and 'how' of the research,
there are also a couple of details not clearly explained/omitted or needing expansion especially if re-
drafting the paper around low velocity impacts:
A) “Half these samples were treated with consolidant, mimicing natural surface cementation”[sic]
The treatment with the alkoxysilane is only half explained with no detail on its cure time. To see it
examined in thin section would have been useful – ie. did the OH100 gel quickly? If it did in an hour
or less (this would be quite unusual) then perhaps it would effect something similar to case
hardening in sandstones – I think the authors need to explain a little more of the simulation
technique and comparison with any examination of 'proper' case hardened sandstone.
as an additional two figures which illustrate the application process as well as the presence of the
silane on the surface on a non-impacted sample (5)
In relation, was the XRD performed on sample 1 before the other samples were treated with silane?
Given the analysis on p11/18 re. deformation/realignment of clays post-impact that the same
deformation patterns in the clays are found across treated and non-treated samples a line should be
added to explain how this also ensures there is no possibility of the clays being deformed by the
silane itself ie. silanes are known to deform some clay minerals through intercrystalline and osmosic
swelling re. any polar liquids.
The figure referred to uses a sample that was not treated with Wacker (now noted in the caption) so
it would not have been affected by this process. It would be beneficial for further study to compare
the impacts on the clays between treated and non-treated samples but it is felt that this would be a
study substantial enough to warrant an individual piece of research rather than being ‘tacked on’
here.
It would be nice to see where the silane is in relation to any deformations in the figures. I first read
the foot of p 19 as meaning that this was indicated in fig 15 because of the XRT being used 'to map
out consolidation and fracture zones' -whereas you really mean 'compaction' zones.
The areas that were treated with silane / Wacker OH 100 lost the entire surface layer within the
impact area (as illustrated by figure 10, now figure 12), so it is difficult to indicate the silane area.
The text on p19 has now been changed to ‘compaction’.
Btw. the figure captions could indicate whether the sample has been shot/treated or not too make
it easier for the reader
This is a very good suggestion, captions have been updated to clarify treated and/or shot status of
samples.
Perhaps the use of silane as a simulation impacted (ha!) the inversion of hardness as described p12
and if this inversion would occur in a 'proper' case-hardened sample?
In other words I'd be wary of any Discussion (cf. p20) in relation to 'proper' case-hardening from the
tests (see point 1 above) as 2 distinct phenomena are in danger of being conflated where only 1
(silane) has been tested, even if the literature backs the general point made (eg. Momber; Wheeler).
Considering that the literature, referred to in the text, backs up the point made it is justified to
continue the line that we can use this simulant to gain some understanding of the effect a bullet
impact would have on a naturally hardened surface. However, throughout the text the emphasis has
been placed now on the role of Wacker as a simulant rather than a like-for-like substitute.
B) re. 'post Impact test' – I wondered why there were no controls: untreated/unshot water
immersed and treated un-shot water immersed with regard to comparisons with 3&4 and 7&8 given
that the tests were designed to further the hypothesis that increased evaporation from damaged
areas accelerates deterioration. There is also a drift (p8) in language to suggest that the tests can say
something about the hypothesis in relation to case-hardened stones when the samples are
simulations of case-hardening.
It was felt at the experiment design stage that the replicates for 3&4 and 7&8 were a necessity,
rather than replicating previous studies on the impact of capillary rise. These studies have been
referred to in the text. However, a replication of this study at a later date will need to address this by
addition the suggested control samples.
the Wacker treatment is used as a simulant of case hardening.
C) p9 did the authors had looked at impact studies on concrete? No, this study focussed solely on
sandstone. However, continued work into concrete would be welcomed and is certainly a good
suggestion for future research. This is now reflected in the concluding remarks section.
An image of the experimental set up for the ERT would be good to see.
This is quite difficult to rectify; there are no images available as none were taken during the
experiment (the trials of working alone in a lab with equipment that requires both hands to operate).
The samples were cut up after the ERT work to provide thin sections so it is not possible to take a
photo of the set-up retrospectively.
D) v. minor point - p4. Where the authors state that 'impact' is not part of any classification
documents they omit to reference the widely accepted CCI's '10 agents of deterioration' where it is
included under Agent 1; physical forces cf. http://canada.p ch.gc.ca/eng/1444924113472 though
very generally.
This suggestion has been incorporated in the text. Many thanks for flagging this up, the authors were
unaware of the existence of this risk listing.
Editorial notes:
I) p7. Fig. 2 it is difficult to distinguish the black dotted lines from the the white horizontal lines of
the lo-res image. Making the 16 squares difficult to see.
This figure has been redrawn, both the horizontal and vertical lines are now visually emphasised.
II) Finally, there are some typos/mispellings eg. 'mimicking' ; p13 'apparently' should be 'apparent' ….
and I noticed one mis-attribution – on p6. Kemp 2015 should be Kemp 2006
The text has been proof read and (hopefully!) all further typos and misspellings have been rectified.
Kemp 2015 has been changed to Kemp 2006

The reviewer’s comments were as fair and helpful as the previous set of comments and we have
endeavoured to respond to all points raised. In a few cases it was not possible to act upon the
suggestion without repeating the entire experiment but we have incorporated the limitations of the
study more clearly instead. We thank the reviewer for their considerable effort and hope that the
manuscript is deemed sufficiently improved.

All data was uploaded to DRYAD (doi:10.5061/dryad.f5d20) shortly before resubmission
Detailed comments:
1)Figure 1 on p3. still needs explanation of where its from so the reader understands it WAS part of your
study! Strangely Fig1 also appears on p6 - surely some mistake?!
The caption was duplicated without any clear function, this has now been removed
2) The line on p5 explaining why you scaled down to a .22, - 'the extent of destruction wrought by the

examination of the interactions the interactions between impact sites, surrounding fracture networks and

That was my question in my original review, which came first, the blocks or the calibre choice?..and
unfortunately its seems the pre-cut blocks forced the decision, which I feel methodologically/in terms of
the research question was the wrong decision - this is somewhat compounded by the final line: 'Whilst
this discrepancy in scales must be noted, here we lay the methodological foundations for future
investigations of larger imapcts and highlight the pressing need for further research in to endangered
built heritage.' ie. a missed opportunity...
Or, as a more hopeful interpretation, an opportunity to build on this initial research
3) p4 line 18 - re. ' Canadian Conservation Institute Agent 1 risk listings of catastrophic forces (CCI, no
date),' - these are more familiar as the 'Ten agents of Deterioration' and were drawn up originally as 9
by Stefan Michalski in 1994 and a tenth (custodial neglect) was added by Robert Waller in 1995....
This title has now been changed in the bibliography
4) p5 line 10 - too many 'artificially' s
5) p6. 'The results presented here highlight that the impact of bullets on stone surfaces is not a
straightforward creation of an impact fracture network but is dictated by the stone’s ability to process
the influx of stress associated with the impact as well as pre-existing alteration of the stone' - perhaps
more simply put - that pre-existing stress patterns influence any impact fracture networks ?
This refers to the case hardening of the stone and has now been clarified in the text
6) p7 re. '1.1 Stone samples' - it is now apparent that the samples were cut before any testing to
determine sample size was made with an AK47 ....as above, I think this was an avoidable error.
Yes, this is indeed part of the learning curve – the samples had to be transported to the shooting range
which limited the potential sample size. With no pre-existing research to build on it was not possible to
determine in advance the sample size needed for an AK47. However, the aim was to capture a full
fracture network from an impact and therefore calibre was adjusted to suit the aims and objectives of
the experiment rather than the other way around.
7) line 56 - infestation, not investation ....
This has been rectified in the text
8) not so important but Fig 3 perhaps better as just the enhanced version?? and larger as a bit difficult
to see ...
The figure supplied could be cut to only show the enhanced version. However, some readers might
object to this as they want to see the original version. As a compromise we have cut the figure into 3A
and 3B which can then be viewed separately, at a larger size, according to preference.
9) p12 line 34 - decrease not 'decease'
This has been rectified in the text
10) p16 'The presence or absence of a fracture network developed at the time of impact' - needs
rephrasing to make clearer given what you go on to say - something like the presence or absence of any
pre-existing stresses in the substrate ??
This paragraph has now been rephrased to emphasise the findings:
As can be seen in figures 6 and 7, all samples were negatively affected by the environmental cabinet
treatment. However, the extent to which the samples were affected by the treatment appeared to be
strongly related to the nature of fracture network developed at the time of impact, as based on the
research set out by Momber (2004): The rigid, Wacker OH 100 treated, fractured surface appears to be
more vulnerable to temperature changes overall, whereas the untreated and more plastic surface
appears to cope far better with the thermal stresses placed upon the samples in the environmental
cabinet but suffered noticeable degradation of the impact area, leaving it vulnerable to potential
cavernous weathering. The pre-impact condition of the surface is therefore instrumental in determining
the impact of a projectile, such as a bullet, and projecting future deterioration patterns.
11) you say 'cavernous' I say 'alveolar' !!
The first author politely disagrees, but this is simply an issue of personal preference in terminology.
Alveolar is as valid a term as cavernous when describing the formation of hollow features in a stone
surface.
12) p16 line 44 - 'impact areas resulting from armed warfare' is better
This has been rectified in the text
13) p16 - last 2 sentences need rewriting as they are clumsy - also would moisture transport distribution
have been different if simulated from the back not the foot? .. Line 55 remove '(see figure 8)'
These lines have been rewritten: Capillary rise facilitates the upward movement of moisture until it
reaches the impact area where it moves towards the surface and evaporates. An accumulation of
moisture within the subsurface impact area can also be distinguished, forming a wedge shape of low
resistivity into the stone body and saturating the inter-grain spaces in the fracture network
All references to Wacker have been changed to Wacker OH 100
15) p20 lines 17+ - this statement contradicts line 22 on p19
This line has now been changed to reflect the referral to the grains in the immediate vicinity of the
impact area: implying that even though impact area development may differ the effects of the impact on
mineral grains immediately surrounding the impact area are very similar
16) p21 - I still think this section on the deposition of lead is not relevant and should be cut/made a a
footnote unless linked to lead-based materials used in armed conflict - it is purely contingent on the
small arms you chose to use and detracts from the study of increased weathering as a result of bullet
impacts ...
This section has now been cut
17) p23 line 3 - this relates to my question in point 13) above, and the observation might be contingent
upon the way you effected moisture transport....
“capillary rise of groundwater” has now been added to clarify the moisture source investigated here.
18) p24 line 10 - and for AK47s ??? begs the question .. also you should add-in '.22 calibre bullets'
line 54 should be '..small calibre bullet impacts...'
.22 calibre has been added to mentions of small bullet impacts. In addition the following line was added
to the end of the discussion: The results from this study therefore beg the question; if such small
impacts can alter the stone to this extent, what are the long-term consequences of larger impacts such
as AK47s?
