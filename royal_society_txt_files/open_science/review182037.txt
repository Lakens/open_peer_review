Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
This manuscript makes a significant contribution to our understanding of treeshrew opsin genes
and visual ecology & evolution. The subject matter is certainly appropriate for Royal Society
Open Science. However, the manuscript must be revised before it can be published, as there are
currently fundamental problems with both taxonomic and phylogenetic concepts in the paper. I
have listed these issues below.
Title: “Urogale” must be removed from the title. This genus hasn’t been recognized since 2011
(see Roberts et al. 2011), and is not recognized in any modern classification of treeshrews. I
encourage the authors to read the following recent taxonomic references:

account.php?genus=tupaia&species=everetti

version of 2016 assessment). The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2017: e.T22784A114120582.
http://dx.doi.org/10.2305/IUCN.UK.2017-1.RLTS.T22784A114120582.en.
Furthermore, as the title is currently written, Tupaia is listed in parentheses after Urogale, which
would indicate a subgenus. Tupaia Raffles, 1821 cannot be a subgenus of Urogale Mearns, 1905
because the former has priority. This is why Urogale has been synonymized with Tupaia. In
short, Urogale is no longer recognized, and the authors have indicated a subgenus in the title that
violates taxonomic priority. Hence, removing Urogale from the title is not optional.
Keywords: “Urogale” must be removed from the keywords for the same reasons listed above.
Again, this is not optional because Tupaia cannot be a subgenus (indicated with parentheses) of
Urogale (see above).
Summary
p. 2, line 6: Scandentia is not necessarily nested in Euarchonta, as Scandentia is often recovered as
the sister to Primatomorpha (Primates + Dermoptera). More accurately, Scandentia “is closely
related to” Primates in Euarchonta.
p. 2, line 20: Tupaia Raffles, 1821 is not the “junior synonym” of Urogale Mearns, 1905 (see
above). Quite the opposite. Tupaia (senior synonym) has priority, and therefore Urogale (junior
synonym) has been synonymized with it.
Introduction
p. 3, line 8: no classification is cited for 19 extant tupaiid species. Which outdated classification
3
are they following? Hawkins (2018, see above) includes 22, and the ASM Mammal Diversity
Database (see above) lists 23:
https://mammaldiversity.org/#dHVwYWlpZGFlJmdsb2JhbF9zZWFyY2g9dHJ1ZSZsb29zZT10c
nVl
p. 3, line 10: see comment about “nested” above. Scandentia is the sister to Primatomorpha in
Euarchonta.
p. 3, line 20: the extant Dendrogale is not “basal.” It is the sister to the remaining tupaiid taxa.
There is a literature on such misinterpretation of “basal,” and I would encourage the authors to
consult the following papers:
Crisp MD, Cook LG. 2005. Do early branching lineages signify ancestral traits? Trends Ecol Evol
20:122-128. See Figure 1.
Krell FT, Cranston PS. 2004. Which side of the tree is more basal? Systematic Entomology 29:279-
281.
p. 3, lines 33, 37: change “Urogale” to “Tupaia” to recognize modern taxonomy (see above).
p. 3, lines 35-37: it’s a mischaracterization to say that only Roberts et al. (2011) have “argued for”
the subsumption of Urogale into Tupaia as this has actually been adopted in every recent (2017-
2018) classification of treeshrews (see above). The classification of the Mindanao treeshrew is not
“in flux,” and this manuscript on treeshrews should follow modern taxonomy rather than
outdated classifications. I don’t see how using “traditional nomenclature” is a “matter of
practical convenience” other than failing to update the taxonomy and ignoring recent
publications on the topic. The taxonomy should be updated throughout (i.e., use Tupaia everetti
rather than Urogale), and there should be one sentence explaining that this species used to be
included in Urogale. That will cover the relevant taxonomic history, which is actually more
complex (see Lyon 1913).
p. 3, lines 37-39: T. everetti is part of Tupaia, so it doesn’t occupy a “central position between
Dendrogale and Tupaia.” Do they mean between Dendrogale and other Tupaia species?
p. 3, line 39: the extant T. everetti is not “basal” (see above). Again, there appears to be a
fundamental misunderstanding of this term. See Crisp and Cook (2005, Fig. 1).
p. 3, line 47: change “U.” to “T.” to recognize modern taxonomy (see above). This should be done
throughout the manuscript.
Materials and Methods
p. 4, line 16: change “Urogale” to “Tupaia” here and throughout to recognize modern taxonomy
(see above)
p. 4, lines 26-27: why rely entirely on captive weights? Sargis (2002) tabled wild-caught weights
for “Urogale:”
Sargis EJ. 2002. A multivariate analysis of the postcranium of tree shrews (Scandentia, Tupaiidae)
and its taxonomic implications. Mammalia 66:579-598. Table 4.
p. 4, lines 31-33: UAM is just University of Alaska Museum, so remove “of the North.”
4
p. 4, line 33: the catalog number is the critical one; the CITES export permit number is
unnecessary here and could be removed.
p. 4, line 39: accession numbers are inadequate. Museum catalog numbers must be added.
p. 4, line 41: trapping details (Victor snap-trap baited with earthworms) are unnecessary here and
could be removed.
Results
p. 6, line 26: change “U.” to “T.” to recognize modern taxonomy (see above). Also, “and” should
not be italicized. This should be changed to “Relative to T. everetti and other Tupaia species.”
p. 6, lines 30-32: insert “the” between “whether” and “last.”
p. 6, line 38: change “U.” to “T.” to recognize modern taxonomy (see above). Also, “other”
should be inserted between “from” and “Tupaia.”
p. 6, line 40: “may be the ancestral condition” for what? Tupaiidae? Scandentia? What is the
state in Ptilocercus?
p. 7, lines 10-12: “We predict that the…to have a similar” must be corrected. Change “to have” to
“has.”
Discussion
p. 7, line 53: “colour vision of U. everetti is practically identical to that of Tupaia.” Yes, because it
IS Tupaia (see above). Again, the taxonomy must be updated here. This should be changed to
“colour vision of T. everetti is practically identical to that of other Tupaia species.”
p. 8, lines 10-12: the extant Dendrogale is not “the basal tupaiid” (see above). Again, this term is
being used incorrectly. Dendrogale is the sister to the remaining tupaiid taxa. See Crisp and
Cook (2005, Fig. 1) and Krell and Cranston (2004).
p. 8, lines 12-14: “divergence of the two extant congeners, D. melanura and D. murina, is
estimated at 13 Mya (range: 20-5 Mya.” This divergence appears to be ~21 Mya, not 13 Mya, in
Roberts et al. (2011) Fig. 3.
p. 8, line 14: “last” is unnecessary, as there is only one common ancestor.
p. 8, line 41: “T. montana, the more recent immigrant.” What is the evidence for recent
immigration? A reference should certainly be provided for this.
p. 8, line 43: what does the extra “1” indicate in the references?
p. 8, line 56: remove “along”.
p. 9, line 12: “Primate” should not be capitalized. It should be “primate order” in this case. It
should only be capitalized when being used as a formal taxonomic name as in the order Primates.
Conclusion
p. 9, line 22: “Urogale” must be removed for the same reasons listed above. The authors have
5
proposed an invalid subgenus by including Tupaia in parentheses. Again, this change is not
optional because Tupaia cannot be a subgenus (indicated with parentheses) of Urogale (see
above).
p. 9, line 28: again, “last” is unnecessary.
References
#16: Dendrogale murina must be italicized.
#20: reference is outdated. This IUCN account was updated in 2017 when “Urogale” was
changed to “Tupaia” (see above). The version cited here was accessed two years ago on 2/21/17.
This must be updated to the current IUCN version for this 2019 manuscript submission.
Figure 1
p. 13, line 11: again, see comment about “nested” above. Scandentia is the sister to
Primatomorpha in Euarchonta.
p. 13, line 13: “*Some authors” is a mischaracterization. Every taxonomist focusing on treeshrews
has synonymized Urogale with Tupaia. See the 3 recent references listed above. The taxonomy
being used in this manuscript is out of date and must be updated. Similarly, the literature review
is inadequate, and recent taxonomic references must be cited and added to the reference list.
Figure 2
p. 13, line 21: “Urogale” must be removed from the caption for the same reasons listed above.
Again, this is not optional because Tupaia cannot be a subgenus (indicated with parentheses) of
Urogale (see above).
Figure 3
p. 13, line 34: only reference 15 from 2011 is cited despite starting the sentence with “More
recently.” Even more recently are the three 2017-2018 taxonomic references listed above, all of
which should be cited here.

General comments
Duytschaever et al. sequenced cone opsin genes (SWS1 and M/LWS) from two treeshrew species
(Dendrogale murina and Urogale everetti), inferred the phenotypes of their visual pigments, and
then discussed the ecological implications. This is an in-depth study on treeshrew opsins
following the authors' previous publication on euarchontans. Importantly, the authors sequenced
cone opsin genes from the two key species in order Scandentia, and then reconstructed a better
ancestral state of treeshrew color vision. The paper is interesting and will be valuable for
researchers who are working on the evolution of treeshrews, euarchontans and also other
mammals.
Specific comments
1. It will be better for the authors to add a statement for the site numberings of SWS1 and LWS,
which are following bovine RH1 and LWS respectively. Or else, the authors could use the
numbering of bovine RH1 for both genes.
2. Page 5, line 57. Specify which branch models used, like free-ratio or one-ratio model.
3. Page 6, line 2. Remove the words "of the tuning". Previous publications already reported that
even if the tuning sites are not under positive selection, they are still functionally important for
visual pigments. So it's not necessary to test whether the known tuning sites are under positive
selection or not. However, it will be interesting to test whether any new sites under positive
selection, which will give further candidate(s) for in vitro assay.
4. Page 6, line 49. Change the word SWS to SWS1 to distinguish it from the other short
wavelength sensitive opsin SWS2. Also change the word SWS to SWS1 in Figure 3.
5. Page 7, line 18. Show the full name for LR when it first appears.
6. Page 7, line 19. Put the results based on branch models in front of that based on site models,
according to Methods.
7. Page 7, line 42. I suggest remove the PROVEAN analyses for both genes, given the results do
not help for the phenotypic inferences (<U+03BB>max) of visual pigments in this story. Moreover, the
result contradicts with the phenotypic change of the known critical site (180) for M/LWS and this
is hard to explain.

currently fundamental problems with both taxonomic and phylogenetic concepts in the paper. I
have listed these issues below.
Title: “Urogale” must be removed from the title. This genus hasn’t been recognized since 2011
(see Roberts et al. 2011), and is not recognized in any modern classification of treeshrews. I

Summary
p. 2, line 6: Scandentia is not necessarily nested in Euarchonta, as Scandentia is often recovered as

Introduction

p. 3, line 20: the extant Dendrogale is not “basal.” It is the sister to the remaining tupaiid taxa.
There is a literature on such misinterpretation of “basal,” and I would encourage the authors to
consult the following papers:

p. 3, lines 33, 37: change “Urogale” to “Tupaia” to recognize modern taxonomy (see above).

11
the subsumption of Urogale into Tupaia as this has actually been adopted in every recent (2017-
2018) classification of treeshrews (see above). The classification of the Mindanao treeshrew is not

p. 8, lines 10-12: the extant Dendrogale is not “the basal tupaiid” (see above). Again, this term is
being used incorrectly. Dendrogale is the sister to the remaining tupaiid taxa. See Crisp and
Cook (2005, Fig. 1) and Krell and Cranston (2004).
p. 8, lines 12-14: “divergence of the two extant congeners, D. melanura and D. murina, is
estimated at 13 Mya (range: 20-5 Mya.” This divergence appears to be ~21 Mya, not 13 Mya, in
Roberts et al. (2011) Fig. 3.
p. 8, line 14: “last” is unnecessary, as there is only one common ancestor.
p. 8, line 41: “T. montana, the more recent immigrant.” What is the evidence for recent
immigration? A reference should certainly be provided for this.
p. 8, line 43: what does the extra “1” indicate in the references?
p. 8, line 56: remove “along”.
p. 9, line 12: “Primate” should not be capitalized. It should be “primate order” in this case. It
should only be capitalized when being used as a formal taxonomic name as in the order Primates.
Conclusion
p. 9, line 22: “Urogale” must be removed for the same reasons listed above. The authors have
proposed an invalid subgenus by including Tupaia in parentheses. Again, this change is not
optional because Tupaia cannot be a subgenus (indicated with parentheses) of Urogale (see
above).
p. 9, line 28: again, “last” is unnecessary.
References

#20: reference is outdated. This IUCN account was updated in 2017 when “Urogale” was
changed to “Tupaia” (see above). The version cited here was accessed two years ago on 2/21/17.
This must be updated to the current IUCN version for this 2019 manuscript submission.

Comments to the Author(s)
General comments
Duytschaever et al. sequenced cone opsin genes (SWS1 and M/LWS) from two treeshrew species
(Dendrogale murina and Urogale everetti), inferred the phenotypes of their visual pigments, and
then discussed the ecological implications. This is an in-depth study on treeshrew opsins
following the authors' previous publication on euarchontans. Importantly, the authors sequenced
cone opsin genes from the two key species in order Scandentia, and then reconstructed a better
ancestral state of treeshrew color vision. The paper is interesting and will be valuable for
researchers who are working on the evolution of treeshrews, euarchontans and also other
mammals.
Specific comments
1. It will be better for the authors to add a statement for the site numberings of SWS1 and LWS,
which are following bovine RH1 and LWS respectively. Or else, the authors could use the
numbering of bovine RH1 for both genes.
2. Page 5, line 57. Specify which branch models used, like free-ratio or one-ratio model.
3. Page 6, line 2. Remove the words "of the tuning". Previous publications already reported that
even if the tuning sites are not under positive selection, they are still functionally important for
visual pigments. So it's not necessary to test whether the known tuning sites are under positive
selection or not. However, it will be interesting to test whether any new sites under positive
selection, which will give further candidate(s) for in vitro assay.
4. Page 6, line 49. Change the word SWS to SWS1 to distinguish it from the other short
wavelength sensitive opsin SWS2. Also change the word SWS to SWS1 in Figure 3.
5. Page 7, line 18. Show the full name for LR when it first appears.
6. Page 7, line 19. Put the results based on branch models in front of that based on site models,
according to Methods.
7. Page 7, line 42. I suggest remove the PROVEAN analyses for both genes, given the results do
not help for the phenotypic inferences (<U+03BB>max) of visual pigments in this story. Moreover, the
result contradicts with the phenotypic change of the known critical site (180) for M/LWS and this
is hard to explain.

manuscript makes a significant contribution to our understanding of treeshrew opsin genes
visual ecology & evolution. The subject matter is certainly appropriate for Royal Society
n Science. However, the manuscript must be revised before it can be published, as there
currently fundamental problems with both taxonomic and phylogenetic concepts in the

We thank Reviewer 1 for carefully reviewing our manuscript and helpful comments. We
nowledge the taxonomic concerns and have revised our manuscript according to the modern

hort, Urogale is no longer recognized, and the authors have indicated a subgenus in the title
violates taxonomic priority. Hence, removing Urogale from the title is not optional.
We thank the reviewer for thoroughly explaining the taxonomic issue. We recognize that

, line 6: Scandentia is not necessarily nested in Euarchonta, as Scandentia is often
overed as the sister to Primatomorpha (Primates + Dermoptera). More accurately,
ndentia “is closely related to” Primates in Euarchonta.
Thank you for your comment. We agree that is it more appropriate to refer to Scandentia as
ely related to Primates and Dermoptera in the superordinal group Euarchonta. We have
clarified this in the text. (p. 2, lines 3-4)
, line 20: Tupaia Raffles, 1821 is not the “junior synonym” of Urogale Mearns, 1905 (see

tter of practical convenience” other than failing to update the taxonomy and ignoring recent
lications on the topic. The taxonomy should be updated throughout (i.e., use Tupaia everetti

uded in Urogale. That will cover the relevant taxonomic history, which is actually more
plex (see Lyon 1913).

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We recognize that "central position" is a
leading term because T. everetti much more closely related to the other tupaiids than to
drogale. We have revised the text as follows to clarify this point:

ard to explain.
Thank you for raising this point. While we acknowledge that our PROVEAN analyses did
predict any deleterious effects of the nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions, we still
eve these results are relevant to mention in this paper. When the properties of the amino
do not change drastically (e.g. due to the amino acid’s hydrophobicity), the functional effect
onsynonymous mutations that change the amino acid will be predicted neutral. The
OVEAN results do not contradict the phenotypic change at site 180, but indicate that the
synonymous substitutions are not deleterious to the protein function.
