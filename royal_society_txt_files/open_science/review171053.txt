This is a sound scientific paper suitable for the Royal Society Open Science. There are some
English errors and other comments which are highlighted on the attached document and need to
be address before the paper is accepted. It is important to note that compounds 4e and 5d are not
steric configurations rather regioisomers. (Appendix A)

Comments:
This paper reports on the semisynthesis of a number of novel fraxinellone-based thioethers
containing 1,3,4-oxadiazole ring, and the steric configurations of compounds 4e and 5d were
further confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Besides, some of derivatives displayed good
insecticidal activity against an important agricultural pest, M. separata. So, I think this work can
be published in RSOS after revisions.
1. In my opinion, the choice of the positive control is curious and inappropriate. Why do authors
choose toosendanin as the positive control? This compound simply does not have sufficient
bioactivity itself to be used for pest management, although it is well documented to have insect
antifeedant and growth inhibitory activities. Why didn’t authors choose the synthetic pesticides
(such as fipronil, chlorantraniliprole etc.) as the positive control?
2. The authors should provide the 1H NMR, IR and MS data of the precursor fraxinellone in the
article or SI because these derivatives were prepared from the lead compound fraxinellone.
3
3. In Fig 8. of Result and discussion section, I think the label (Larval, Pupation, Adult) isn’t
accurate because the word “Larval” is an adjective, whereas pupation and adult are noun.
4. As fourth issue is the time required for bioactivity. The sorts of developmental anomalies seen
in the Figures 5-7 could result from innumerable physiological disturbances, from endocrine
disruption to nutritional or digestive interference. The present results do not shed any light on
this.
5. As a side note, there are some spelling and grammatical mistakes in the article, the authors
should carefully check the whole article.

account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

1. In my opinion, the choice of the positive control is curious and inappropriate. Why do authors
choose toosendanin as the positive control? This compound simply does not have sufficient
bioactivity itself to be used for pest management, although it is well documented to have insect
antifeedant and growth inhibitory activities. Why didn’t authors choose the synthetic pesticides
(such as fipronil, chlorantraniliprole etc.) as the positive control?
Answer: We are very thankful to you for your valuable comments. Based on previously reported
protocols (J. Agric. Food Chem. 2009, 57, 7919; Chem.-Eur. J. 2011, 17, 8299) and these
fraxinellone-based thioethers were synthesized from natural product fraxinellone, so we used the
toosendanin as the positive control. It is a commercial botanical insecticide derived from Melia
azedarach. This paper mainly focus on searching for natural product-based insecticides, so we
didn't choose the synthetic pesticides as positive control in present study. In addition, for fipronil,
owing to its toxicity to other non-target organisms, it has been restricted and even banned for
some application in Europe, the United States and China (J. Agric. Food Chem. 2014, 62, 3577.).
2. The authors should provide the 1H NMR, IR and MS data of the precursor fraxinellone in the
article or SI because these derivatives were prepared from the lead compound fraxinellone.
Answer: We have provided the 1H NMR, IR and MS data of the fraxinellone in the revised
manuscript.
3. In Fig 8. of Result and discussion section, I think the label (Larval, Pupation, Adult) isn’t
accurate because the word “Larval” is an adjective, whereas pupation and adult are noun.
Answer: Very thankful to you for your careful reading, we have revised these mistakes in the
revision.
4. As fourth issue is the time required for bioactivity. The sorts of developmental anomalies seen
in the Figures 5-7 could result from innumerable physiological disturbances, from endocrine
disruption to nutritional or digestive interference. The present results do not shed any light on this.
Answer: In our revised manuscript, we made further discussion about the developmental
anomalies seen in the figures 5-7, this phenomenon may be result from these fraxinellone
derivatives effects to nutritional or digestive interference.
5. As a side note, there are some spelling and grammatical mistakes in the article, the authors
should carefully check the whole article.
Answer: In general, we're deeply grateful to you for your careful reading and valuable advice. We
have checked the whole article and revised many spelling and grammatical mistakes which were
highlighted in the revised manuscript.
