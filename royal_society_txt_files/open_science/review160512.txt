Regarding Figure 2,

that the reader can easily understand not only the method of contact angle measurement but also

Review of MS “Does the kinorhynch have a hydrophobic body surface? Measurement of the
wettability of a meiobenthic metazoan”
The MS raises a highly interesting question about the physico-chemical properties of the
kinorhynch cuticle, which has never been even asked before in this way. The experimental
procedure is also straightforward. There are several problems in the MS, but these should be
overcome with not too many efforts, especially since 4 authors are involved, who can share the
workload.
3
Introduction and Discussion put the study in a larger frame of the wettability of the cuticle of
invertebrates and draw conclusions about the way of distribution of Kinorhyncha at large.
Unfortunately, the article suffers from the extremely few citations and the lack of considering the
evolution within Kinorhyncha, so the MS does not really meat up with the expectations raised. I
suggest to focus on Kinorhyncha and here especially on the so-called “E. coulli-group”. I also
suggest to include considerably more references of other scientist’s work especially about
Kinorhyncha and here about TEM studies of the cuticle and gland cells on trunk and head or
about the cuticular surface (e.g., cuticular hairs) of other species of Echinoderes. Several more
suggestions are found in the MS itself. Of course, these references should also be discussed in
more details.
It should be noted (p. 4, l. 45) that almost all kinorhynchs can be extracted with the bubble & blot
method except the obligate intertidal species Echinoderes coulli (see Neuhaus 2013: p. 333) and
probably related species of Echinoderes. It should be kept in mind that the species-rich genus
Echinoderes collects a broad variety of species with different evolutionary lines. And one line
certainly represents a group with E. coulli, E. komatsui of the MS, and other (almost) exclusively
intertidal species of Echinoderes with very distinct protonephridial openings (called “E.coulli-
group”) ; these species are certainly more closely related to each other than to any other species of
Echinoderes; this hypothesis has been uttered in several publications, which are not cited here.
The conclusions drawn for E. komatsui are extended to all kinorhynchs in the Discussion chapter
of the MS, but considering the morphological and ecological specific characters of a closely
related group of species of Echinoderes with specific protonephridial openings and occurrence in
the intertidal habitat, the conclusions in the MS should be worded more carefully. It is much
more likely that the results of the current study are valid only for the above mentioned “E. coulli-
group” and not for Kinorhyncha at large. Distribution of this specific group of species of
Echinoderes by attachment to the water surface doe not seem unlikely, but this method does not
work for subtidal species. The latter are more certainly distributed by bottom currents. The
discussion is not totally clear about these differences.
p. 5: I have several questions about the experimental design, the text does not fully explain
important details of the experiment; please see comments in the MS.
p. 8, l. 126: The last sentence on the page remains a bit too general and too imprecise. The authors
observed that there were gland cells, which probably secreted something through the cuticle,
because the authors observed pores through the cuticle above a gland cell (Fig. 1d). It is neither
documented to which type of gland cell outlet Fig. 1c refers to (Yamasaki & Fujimoto 2014
distinguish 2 types of gland cell outlets), nor on which segment the gland cell outlet was found.
This is not a comprehensive morphological basis for far-reaching conclusions in the Discussion.
And the authors observed some detritus at a short distance from the surface of the cuticle (Fig.
1c). Unfortunately, the authors did not try any light microscopical staining tests to figure out
whether there would be indead some relationship between the contents of the gland cells and the
mucus, which is postulated but not demonstrated by the TEM studies. I strongly recommend to
try such light microscopical tests, which should not be too difficult to conduct. Without the test,
the suggestion that gland cell outlets secrete some mucus is not unlikely to which detritus
attaches, but evidence could be provided easily with a staining test for mucus. The current study
seems to be incomplete without this test.
Fig. 1: Fig. 1 is provided at a low magnification although it contains some of the most valuable
information about the morphological characters of the cuticle. I suggest to bring the plate at least
to the full width of the journal in order to allow the reader to really see the details.
Fig. 2, Tab. 1, EMS1.xls: Fig. 2 and Tab. 1 show actually the same data. I recommend to present
the original data in the main text and include them in Tab. 1 in order to allow the reader to read
and understand the whole story more easily. Please note in the introductory explanation of the
4
annotation marked with an asterisk in EMS1.xls that kinorhynchs do not possess a tail but lateral
terminal spines.
EMS4docx: I strongly suggest to include the illustration about the wettability of the kinorhynch
cuticle now presented as “Electronic Supplementary Material 4” into the publication, because this
visualization of the authors’ core hypothesis is too important to publish it as supplementary,
which may or may not be read by the readers. See Appendix A.

I think the manuscript benefitted from the improvements by the authors and their extra efforts to

Figs 2, 3: Both figures are very important for the understanding of the paper. Therefore, I strongly
recommend to enlarge the figures to width of the page. Both figures are not sharp in the images

9 39 water surface [1]. Theoretically, more bubbles adhere to hydrophobic surfaces, and aquatic
10
11
12 40 organisms are thought to have hydrophilic bodies [2] and some appear to have elaborate
13
14
15 41 hydrophilic coats on their bodies [1, 3, 4]. In contrast, some interstitial invertebrates are
16
17
18
19 42 hydrophobic; Cloney and Hansson [1] noted that “many interstitial invertebrates that do not
20
21
22 43 swim near the surface are hydrophobic (E. E. Ruppert, personal communication)”. By
23
24
25 44 utilising their hydrophobic properties, some interstitial invertebrates, such as kinorhynchs,
26
27
28 45 can be collected on the water surface by the bubbling and blot method [5, 6]. However, some
29
30
31
32
46 interstitial invertebrates live near the water surface and they run the risk of being trapped at
33
34
35 47 the water surface.

38 48 Echinoderes komatsui Yamasaki and Fujimoto 2014 is a kinorhynch found in
39
40
41 49 intertidal flats at river mouths where the water level, salinity, and water temperature fluctuate
42
43
44
50 daily due to the ebb and flow of the tides; the surface of the tidal flat is often dry at low tide.
45
46
47
48 51 Although this kinorhynch lives near the water surface, it can be collected by the bubbling and
49
50
51 52 blot method, indicating that it has a hydrophobic body. Does the kinorhynch actually have a
52
53
54 53 hydrophobic body surface? Although kinorhynchs are too small (less than 0.1 mm in width)
55
56
57 54 to measure wettability using the conventional method, we evaluated the wettability of E.

49
50
51 70 more readily on a hydrophilic surface and has a smaller CA and a shorter TIME.

91 in the body during the measurements. The neck comprised 16 placids with no hairs, while the
4
5
6 92 trunk had 11 segments with numerous cuticular hairs (see [7]) (Fig. 1b). A pair of lateral
7
8
9 93 terminal spines was present on the last (11th) segment. The cuticular surface was smooth, but
10
11
12 94 the surface was often covered with debris that was probably trapped in the secreted mucus
13
14
15 95 (Fig. 1c). Gland cells were found beneath the trunk cuticle and the glandular cell outlets
16
17
18
19 96 opened on the cuticular surface (Fig. 1d).
20
21
22 97 Wettability was measured on three parts of the animal body: anterior (head + neck),
23
24
25 98 middle (anterior–middle trunk), and posterior parts (posterior trunk + terminal spines). Table
26
27
28 99 1 summarises the averages of CA and TIME with standard deviations (SDs) in intact and
29
30
31
32
100 washed specimens. Electronic supplementary materials 1–3 show each measured value and
33
34
35 101 high-speed movies of water drops on hydrophilic (intact) and hydrophobic (washed)
36
37
38 102 specimens, respectively. Based on the CA values, the anterior part was less hydrophilic than
39
40
41 103 the other parts in the intact specimens (Student-Newman-Keuls test: p < 0.05), whereas the
42
43
44
104 variation in TIME among parts was not significant (ANOVA: p = 0.2922). In washed
45
46
47
48 105 specimens, there was no variation in either CA or TIME among the three parts (ANOVA: CA,
49
50
51 106 p = 0.7395; TIME, p = 0.3521). The washing treatment significantly decreased wettability of
52
53
54 107 the middle part (t-test: CA, p < 0.01; TIME, p < 0.01) and posterior part (t-test: CA, p < 0.05;
55
56
57 108 TIME, p < 0.05), whereas neither CA nor TIME differed significantly on the anterior part

4
5
6 110 following the washing treatment, wettability was recovered on the middle part (n, 2; CA
7
8
9 111 23.6° ± 1.83; TIME, 480 ms ± 396.0) and posterior part (n, 2; CA 39.7° ± 3.11; TIME, 930
10
11
12 112 ms ± 636.4), whereas the anterior part was still hydrophobic (n, 1; CA, 151°; TIME, 4060

15 113 ms).

20
21
22 115 4. Discussion
23
24
25 116 In intact specimens of E. komatsui, the middle and posterior parts had hydrophilic surfaces
26
27
28 117 (about 60° [CA], < 1 s [TIME]), whereas the anterior part (head + neck) was less hydrophilic
29
30
31
32
118 (nearly 80° [CA], > 1 s [TIME]). Wettability varied among the specimens, probably because
33
34
35 119 of the extent of damage during handling of the specimens. Wettability on the middle and
36
37
38 120 posterior parts significantly decreased after the washing treatment (about 80° [CA], > 1 s
39
40
41 121 [TIME]), indicating that a hydrophilic coat covers the hydrophobic trunk in situ and this was
42
43
44
122 removed by pipetting. Because the difference in the wettability on the anterior part was not
45
46
47
48 123 significant between intact and washed specimens, the anterior part is not or is rarely covered
49
50
51 124 by a hydrophilic coat. Following a 1 h incubation in seawater, the middle and posterior parts
52
53
54 125 recovered their wettability, but the anterior part remained hydrophobic. Thus, the coat is
55
56
57 126 probably secreted from the trunk. Ultrastructural observations suggest that the hydrophilic
58
59

2
3
127 coat is a mucus layer secreted from gland cells via glandular outlets opening on the cuticular
4
5
6 128 surface of the trunk.
7
8
9 129 Yamasaki and Fujimoto [7] observed that E. komatsui has two types of glandular cell
10
11
12 130 outlets that open on each trunk segment; the outlets shown in Figure 1d correspond to outlet
13
14
15 131 type 1, characterised by small, multiple openings. Several types of gland cell have been
16
17
18
19 132 described in many kinorhynchs and some studies have reported a mucus layer on the trunk
20
21
22 133 surface [8, 9]. Therefore, secretion of a mucus layer is a general feature of kinorhynchs. The
23
24
25 134 trunk segments of E. komatsui are densely covered with cuticular hairs and these hairs appear
26
27
28 135 to prevent the loss of the hydrophilic coat. Many intertidal kinorhynchs belonging to the
29
30
31
32
136 Echinoderes colli group have dense hairs on the trunk cuticle [7, 10]. The hairs may be an
33
34
35 137 adaptation to protect the hydrophilic coat from exfoliation in species living near the water
36
37
38 138 surface. Among the parts of the body, the anterior part was less hydrophilic than the middle
39
40
41 139 and posterior parts, and recovery of wettability in this part did not occur during the 1 h
42
43
44
140 incubation period after washing treatment. This is consistent with the lack of hairs and
45
46
47
48 141 glandular outlets on the head and neck, and the mucus layer on the anterior part would be
49
50
51 142 more easily exfoliated than the other parts due to the active projection and retraction of the
52
53
54 143 head.
55
56
57 144 Unlike many aquatic invertebrates, kinorhynchs are thought to have a hydrophobic

3
145 body, because they are trapped on the water surface by the bubbling and blot method. The
4
5
6 146 present study, however, shows that their body cuticle is hydrophobic, but that they have a
7
8
9 147 hydrophilic trunk, probably due to a hydrophilic coat. We believe that bubbles rarely adhere
10
11
12 148 to the kinorhynch body in their natural habitat. Moreover, they may expand their dispersal
13
14
15 149 ability by controlling the wettability of their body surface. In the habitat of E. komatsui,
16
17
18
19 150 breaking waves and fluctuations in water temperature produce tiny bubbles in the water.
20
21
22 151 Under normal conditions, bubbles rarely adhere to a body with a hydrophilic coat. When the
23
24
25 152 hydrophilic layer is exfoliated by disturbance under stormy conditions, the dense cuticular
26
27
28 153 hairs allow bubbles to more readily adhere to the body surface; the bubbles on the
29
30
31
32
154 hydrophobic, hairy surface are thought to be in a Wenzel state and less detachable than the
33
34
35 155 bubbles on a smooth surface. Consequently, the bubbles become attached to kinorhynchs,
36
37
38 156 allowing them to float on the water surface, where they drift over the sea, resulting in
39
40
41 157 long-distance dispersal. Later, secretion of hydrophilic mucus restores wettability and the
42
43
44
158 drifting animals settle on the seafloor again (electronic supplementary materials 4). Although
45
46
47
48 159 the dispersal mechanism of kinorhynchs is still uncertain, they may be dispersed by ocean
49
50
51 160 currents [11]. Regulation of the wettability of the body surface may be involved in other
52
53
54 161 functions that are valuable to interstitial organisms.

Appendix B
Response to Referees
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Regarding Figure 2,
1. How about to add some selected image showing the shape of water droplet
on the body, so that the reader can easily understand not only the method of
contact angle measurement but also see the actual shape of droplet on the
body.
We added a new figure plate as Figure 2 to show captured images from the
high-speed movies.
2. I recommend to add "Electronic supplementary material (ESM): EMS4.docx"
in the main text. I will be helpful to understand the author's discussion about the
behavior of Echinoderes komatsui in the water, or combining with Figure 2 would
be fine.
Electronic supplementary material 4 was modified and added in the main text
as Figure 3.
3. Name of Y-axis in Figure 2(b) should be corrected.
We deleted Figure 2 following the comment of the reviewer 2.

Comments to the Author(s)
Review of MS “Does the kinorhynch have a hydrophobic body surface?
Measurement of the wettability of a meiobenthic metazoan”
The MS raises a highly interesting question about the physico-chemical
properties of the kinorhynch cuticle, which has never been even asked before in
this way. The experimental procedure is also straightforward. There are several
problems in the MS, but these should be overcome with not too many efforts,
especially since 4 authors are involved, who can share the workload.
Introduction and Discussion put the study in a larger frame of the wettability of
the cuticle of invertebrates and draw conclusions about the way of distribution of
Kinorhyncha at large. Unfortunately, the article suffers from the extremely few
citations and the lack of considering the evolution within Kinorhyncha, so the MS
does not really meat up with the expectations raised. I suggest to focus on
Kinorhyncha and here especially on the so-called “E. coulli-group”. I also
suggest to include considerably more references of other scientist’s work
especially about Kinorhyncha and here about TEM studies of the cuticle and
gland cells on trunk and head or about the cuticular surface (e.g., cuticular hairs)
of other species of Echinoderes. Several more suggestions are found in the MS
itself. Of course, these references should also be discussed in more details.
It should be noted (p. 4, l. 45) that almost all kinorhynchs can be extracted with
the bubble & blot method except the obligate intertidal species Echinoderes
coulli (see Neuhaus 2013: p. 333) and probably related species of Echinoderes.
It should be kept in mind that the species-rich genus Echinoderes collects a
broad variety of species with different evolutionary lines. And one line certainly
represents a group with E. coulli, E. komatsui of the MS, and other (almost)
exclusively intertidal species of Echinoderes with very distinct protonephridial
openings (called “E.coulli-group”) ; these species are certainly more closely
related to each other than to any other species of Echinoderes; this hypothesis
has been uttered in several publications, which are not cited here.
The conclusions drawn for E. komatsui are extended to all kinorhynchs in the
Discussion chapter of the MS, but considering the morphological and ecological
specific characters of a closely related group of species of Echinoderes with
specific protonephridial openings and occurrence in the intertidal habitat, the
conclusions in the MS should be worded more carefully. It is much more likely
that the results of the current study are valid only for the above mentioned “E.
coulli-group” and not for Kinorhyncha at large. Distribution of this specific group
of species of Echinoderes by attachment to the water surface doe not seem
unlikely, but this method does not work for subtidal species. The latter are more
certainly distributed by bottom currents. The discussion is not totally clear about
these differences.
We added the following sentences at the beginning of the second paragraph
of Introduction.
" Species of the phylum Kinorhyncha are marine, meiobenthic metazoans that
occur in various marine sediments; e.g., mud, fine sand and coarse shell sand.
They are distributed in the intertidal zone to the abyssal depths from the polar
to the tropical regions. Almost all kinorhynchs can be extracted with the bubble
& blot method [7, 8], except some obligate intertidal species [9]."
[9] is Neuhaus (2013).
We rewrote the last paragraph in Discussion as bellow.
"The mechanisms of kinorhynch dispersal have been rarely discussed: some
intertidal species of Echinoderes are distributed along oceanic current [14],
bottom current may transport Campyloderes sp. inhabiting mainly deep
seafloor [15], and Echinoderes ohtsukai may expand their distribution range
associated with the oyster culture [16]. The regulation of
hydrophilic/hydrophobic body surface with presence/absence of hydrophilic
mucus layer could help long-distance dispersal of kinorhynchs by drifting,
especially in intertidal and shallow-water Echinoderes like E. komatsui. It will
be interesting to investigate the wettability of other kinorhynchs inhabiting
subtidal and deeper zones and examine whether they have an ability to
regulate the wettability in a future study. In addition, some other interstitial
organisms are trapped by the bubbling and blotting method, such as
ostracods, tanaids, harpaticoids and nematodes; they would have
hydrophobic body surface as kinorhynchs have, and they may possess similar
or other mechanisms controlling the wettability of their body surface. It is also
possible that the regulation of the wettability may involve other functions that
are valuable to meiobenthic organisms."
Whereas we dealt with only one species, E. komatsui, in the present study,
this is the first report on the meiobenthic organisms trapped by bubbling &
blotting method. Thus, it is reasonable to discuss the potential importance of
the wettability for meiobenthos.
p. 5: I have several questions about the experimental design, the text does not
fully explain important details of the experiment; please see comments in the
MS.
We respond to the all commentson the PDF. See "To comments on PDF"
below.
p. 8, l. 126: The last sentence on the page remains a bit too general and too
imprecise. The authors observed that there were gland cells, which probably
secreted something through the cuticle, because the authors observed pores
through the cuticle above a gland cell (Fig. 1d). It is neither documented to which
type of gland cell outlet Fig. 1c refers to (Yamasaki & Fujimoto 2014 distinguish
2 types of gland cell outlets), nor on which segment the gland cell outlet was
found. This is not a comprehensive morphological basis for far-reaching
conclusions in the Discussion. And the authors observed some detritus at a
short distance from the surface of the cuticle (Fig. 1c). Unfortunately, the authors
did not try any light microscopical staining tests to figure out whether there would
be indead some relationship between the contents of the gland cells and the
mucus, which is postulated but not demonstrated by the TEM studies. I strongly
recommend to try such light microscopical tests, which should not be too difficult
to conduct. Without the test, the suggestion that gland cell outlets secrete some
mucus is not unlikely to which detritus attaches, but evidence could be provided
easily with a staining test for mucus. The current study seems to be incomplete
without this test.
We could not specify the trunk segment in Fig. 1d strictly. The type of the
gland cell was discussed in the second paragraph of discussion based on the
structure of the openings.
Following the recommendation, we tried vital staining with several dyes (e.g.
toluidine blue, hematoxylin, and rose Bengal). However, we could not
visualize the mucus layer, whereas some insoluble materials in the
hematoxylin cover the cuticle, suggesting the presence of invisible material
the body. We added the image of histological section in which debris cover the
cuticle of the animal. In materials and methods, we added "Thick sections
were stained with toluidine blue for light microscopy," to describe the staining
for the histological section.
Fig. 1: Fig. 1 is provided at a low magnification although it contains some of the
most valuable information about the morphological characters of the cuticle. I
suggest to bring the plate at least to the full width of the journal in order to allow
the reader to really see the details.
We enlarged the TEM images as suggested.
Fig. 2, Tab. 1, EMS1.xls: Fig. 2 and Tab. 1 show actually the same data. I
recommend to present the original data in the main text and include them in Tab.
1 in order to allow the reader to read and understand the whole story more easily.
Please note in the introductory explanation of the annotation marked with an
asterisk in EMS1.xls that kinorhynchs do not possess a tail but lateral terminal
spines.
We modified Table 1 as suggested and deleted Figure 2.
We changed "tail" to "lateral terminal spines".
EMS4docx: I strongly suggest to include the illustration about the wettability of
the kinorhynch cuticle now presented as “Electronic Supplementary Material 4”
into the publication, because this visualization of the authors’ core hypothesis is
too important to publish it as supplementary, which may or may not be read by
the readers.
Electronic supplementary material 4 was modified and added in the main text
as Figure 3.
To comments on PDF
To my knowledge, aquatic insects and crustaceans like ostracods do have a
hydrophobic cuticle. Actually, the hydrophobous property of the cuticle is used to
extract both ostracods (see Müller 1894) and kinorhynchs (see Zelinka 1928)
from marine sediment.
We changed "such as kinorhynchs" to "such as kinorhynchs and some
crustaceans".
not the invertebrates but their cuticles are hydrophobic
Changed to "--- have hydrophobic body surface"
The method is called bubble & blot or bubbling & blotting.
Changed to "blotting"
Please cite Zelinka (1928) who tried this method first based on a publication by
Mu¨ller (1894) about the extraction of marine ostracods.
Cited as suggested.
What do you mean with "conventional method"? Please describe briefly this
method, so the reader gets some idea, why this method cannot be applied to
kinorhynchs.
We rewrote the sentences.
of ?
We rewrote as "time it takes for a water drop to disappear"
Please cite Müller (1894) or Zelinka (1928) here, because these are the
inventors of the bubble part of the method whereas Higgins seems to be the
inventor of the blot part of the method.
We cited the references in Introduction
Why are the specimens maintained at 21 promille salinity of the seawater? Is
that the salinity of the water in which the animals normally live? Please explain
the reason for keeping the specimens at 21 promille seawater.
We explained that "the salinity of the interstitial water at the collection site was
about 21‰".
Please do not use abbreviations in the text, it is much easier for the reader to
understand the text without abbreviations.
We changed as suggested. "CA" was used only in parentheses.
It should be stated clearly that the experiments refer to the trunk region and not
to the head, which is usually withdrawn if a specimen is disturbed/out of its
natural environment. - This is at least what I assume the authors have done.
We added the explanation in the next paragraph.
than on a hydrophobous surface.
We changed as suggested.
How was the specimen placed on the glass slide: with an Irwin-loop traditionally
used for meiofauna or with a Pasteur pipette? The Irwin-loop may cause some
mechanical stress to the cuticle's surface. What happened with the excessive
water, if a specimen was placed on a glass slide if a pipette was used? Was the
animal blotted dry or did the authors wait until the seawater had evaporated?
We added explanation as follows, " Each kinorhynch was gently transferred
and placed on a glass slide using a Pasteur pipet, and the excessive
water was removed with a piece of absorbent paper."
rinse with buffer ?
We changed as suggested.
for the distribution of gland cell outlets see Yamasaki & Fujimoto (2014)
We discussed the type of the gland cell in Discussion citing Yamasaki and
Fujimoto (2014)
Again, it is not clear whether the trunk or the head is meant with "anterior part".
Gland cell outlets are found on several trunk segments starting at the
posterior margin of segment 1 (Yamasaki & Fujimoto 2014). Why is this not
discussed in more detail?
We rewrote the first sentence of this paragraph and re-assigned the regions
as "anterior (neck + anterior trunk), middle (middle trunk), and posterior parts
(posterior trunk)".
We deleted "Thus, the coat is probably secreted from the trunk".
see comment in review
See responses to the review.
Observation on few species and citation of so few articles do not allow to draw
such a general conclusion. Please word more carefully, like that mucus secretion
may be more widespread among Kinorhyncha.
This sentence was deleted.
8 = Neuhaus 20013: Fig.5.1.24
References were added
Interesting hypothesis, but many species of Echinoderes living subtidally also
possess abundant hairs (for comparison see Neuhaus 2013: Figs 5.1.20 -5.1.23
or other original publications).
We changed the sentence as bellow.
"Dense hairs covering on the trunk segments are shown in many Echinoderes
species [9, 10, 11, 13], and the hairs may have a similar function at least in
intertidal and shallow-water species that usually face a threat of attaching air
bubbles on their body surface."
This is not true, scalids do possess cells which are supposed to be secretive,
see summary in Neuhaus (2013: p. 246) and original data in Moritz & Storch
(1972), Brown (1989), and Kristensen & Higgins (1991).
We changed the sentence as bellow.
"Kinorhynchs always repeat retraction and projection of the head for
locomotion, and the mucus layer on the anterior part would be more easily
exfoliated than the other parts due to the active movement of the head."
bubble & blot or bubbling & blotting
Corrected as suggested.
If the hight tide raises slowly like most of the time in the German wadden sea,
there should be few bublles. Of course, the situation is totally different during
storms and more windy wether.
Our research field is located on a subtropical island fringed by coral reefs and
often has stormy weather. Probably quite different from the German wadden
sea.
This is certainly a very specific term, which is not generally used in zoology, so
please explain what is meant.
We changed as "--- get into the gap among the hairs and the cuticle ----"
may restore
Changed as suggested.
This illustration represents a significant part of your hypothesis, and should
therefore be placed in the text and not in supplementary material (see also
comment in review).
We changed ESM4 to Figure 3.
Few studies have addressed this topic, one of them is Neuhaus & Soerensen
(2013) about Campyloderes.
We changed as follows,
"The mechanisms of kinorhynch dispersal have been rarely discussed: some
intertidal species of Echinoderes are distributed along oceanic current [14],
bottom current may transport Campyloderes sp. inhabiting mainly deep
seafloor [15], and Echinoderes ohtsukai may expand their distribution range
associated with the oyster culture [16]. The regulation of
hydrophilic/hydrophobic body surface with presence/absence of hydrophilic
mucus layer could help long-distance dispersal of kinorhynchs by drifting,
especially in intertidal and shallow-water Echinoderes like E. komatsui."
ne is not explained
Explanation of "ne" was added in the figure caption.

37 benthic shallow or intertidal zones. For instance, ascidian larvae, when deprived of their
4
5
6 38 vitelline coats and test cells, have a hydrophobic integument and are easily trapped at the
7
8
9 39 water surface [1]. Theoretically, more bubbles adhere to hydrophobic surfaces, and aquatic
10
11
12 40 organisms are thought to have hydrophilic bodies [2] and some appear to have elaborate
13
14
15 41 hydrophilic coats on their bodies [1, 3, 4]. In contrast, some interstitial invertebrates have
16
17
18
19 42 hydrophobic body surface; Cloney and Hansson [1] noted that “many interstitial invertebrates
20
21
22 43 that do not swim near the surface are hydrophobic (E. E. Ruppert, personal communication)”.
23
24
25 44 By utilising their hydrophobic properties, some interstitial invertebrates can be collected on
26
27
28 45 the water surface by the bubbling and blotting method [5, 6, 7, 8]. However, some interstitial
29
30
31
32
46 invertebrates live near the water surface and they run the risk of being trapped at the water
33
34
35 47 surface.

37
38 48 Species of the phylum Kinorhyncha are marine, meiobenthic metazoans that occur in
39
40
41 49 various marine sediments; e.g., mud, fine sand and coarse shell sand. They are distributed in
42
43
44
50 the intertidal zone to the abyssal depths from the polar to the tropical regions. Almost all
45
46
47
48 51 kinorhynchs can be extracted with the bubble & blot method [7, 8], except some obligate
49
50
51 52 intertidal species [9]. Echinoderes komatsui Yamasaki and Fujimoto 2014 is a kinorhynch
52
53
54 53 found in intertidal flats at river mouths where the water level, salinity, and water temperature
55
56
57 54 fluctuate daily due to the ebb and flow of the tides; the surface of the tidal flat is often dry at

7
8
9 57 actually have a hydrophobic body surface? The wettability for water, the degree of
10
11
12 58 hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, is usually evaluated with the contact angle of the water drop
13
14
15 59 on the surface. However, kinorhynchs are too small (less than 0.1 mm in width) to measure
16
17
18
19 60 wettability using a standard contact angle meter, because of the difficulty of handling
20
21
22 61 picoliters of water droplet that evaporates in a short time. Here, we used a microscopic

25 62 contact angle meter equipped with high-speed camera to evaluate the wettability of E.

53
54 107 The animal body consisted of a head, neck, and trunk (Fig. 1a); the head was mostly retracted
55
56
57 108 in the body during the measurements. The neck comprised 16 placids with no hairs, while the

2
3
109 trunk had 11 segments with numerous cuticular hairs (see [10]) (Fig. 1b). A pair of lateral
4
5
6 110 terminal spines was present on the last (11th) segment. The cuticular surface was smooth, but
7
8
9 111 the surface was often covered with debris that was probably trapped in the secreted mucus
10
11
12 112 (Fig. 1c, d). In the histological section (Fig. 1c), granular cells were occasionally distributed
13
14
15 113 beneath the cuticle. In TEM, gland cells were found beneath the trunk cuticle and the
16
17
18
19 114 glandular cell outlets opened on the cuticular surface (Fig. 1e).
20
21
22 115 Wettability was measured on three parts of the animal body: anterior (neck +
23
24
25 116 anterior trunk), middle (middle trunk), and posterior parts (posterior trunk). Table 1
26
27
28 117 summarises the averages of contact angle and TIME with standard deviations (SDs) in intact
29
30
31
32
118 and washed specimens, and each measured values was shown in Electronic supplementary
33
34
35 119 material 1. Water drops on hydrophilic (intact) specimen have smaller contact angles and
36
37
38 120 shorter disappearance times than those on hydrophobic (washed) specimens (Fig. 2,
39
40
41 121 Electronic supplementary materials 2–3). Based on the contact angles, the anterior part was
42
43
44
122 less hydrophilic than the other parts in the intact specimens (Student-Newman-Keuls test: p <
45
46
47
48 123 0.05), whereas the variation in TIME among parts was not significant (ANOVA: p = 0.2922).
49
50
51 124 In washed specimens, there was no variation in either contact angle or TIME among the three
52
53
54 125 parts (ANOVA: CA, p = 0.7395; TIME, p = 0.3521). The washing treatment significantly
55
56
57 126 decreased wettability of the middle part (t-test: CA, p < 0.01; TIME, p < 0.01) and posterior

3
127 part (t-test: CA, p < 0.05; TIME, p < 0.05), whereas neither contact angle nor TIME differed
4
5
6 128 significantly on the anterior part (t-test: CA, p = 0.2818; TIME, p = 0.1269). After a 1 h
7
8
9 129 incubation in seawater following the washing treatment, wettability was recovered on the
10
11
12 130 middle part (n, 2; CA 23.6° ± 1.83; TIME, 480 ms ± 396.0) and posterior part (n, 2; CA 39.7°
13
14
15 131 ± 3.11; TIME, 930 ms ± 636.4), whereas the anterior part was still hydrophobic (n, 1; CA,
16
17
18
19 132 151°; TIME, 4060 ms).
20
21
22 133
23
24
25 134 4. Discussion
26
27
28 135 In intact specimens of E. komatsui, the middle and posterior parts had hydrophilic surfaces
29
30
31
32
136 (about 60° [CA], < 1 s [TIME]), whereas the anterior part (neck + anterior trunk) was less
33
34
35 137 hydrophilic (nearly 80° [CA], > 1 s [TIME]). Wettability varied among the specimens,
36
37
38 138 probably because of the extent of damage during handling of the specimens. Wettability on
39
40
41 139 the middle and posterior parts significantly decreased after the washing treatment (about 80°
42
43
44
140 [CA], > 1 s [TIME]), indicating that a hydrophilic coat covers the hydrophobic trunk in situ
45
46
47
48 141 and this was removed by pipetting. Because the difference in the wettability on the anterior
49
50
51 142 part was not significant between intact and washed specimens, the anterior part is not or is
52
53
54 143 rarely covered by a hydrophilic coat. Following a 1 h incubation in seawater, the middle and
55
56
57 144 posterior parts recovered their wettability, but the anterior part remained hydrophobic.

1
2
3
145 Ultrastructural observations suggest that the hydrophilic coat is a mucus layer secreted from
4
5
6 146 gland cells via glandular outlets opening on the cuticular surface of the trunk.
7
8
9 147 Yamasaki and Fujimoto [10] observed that E. komatsui has two types of glandular
10
11
12 148 cell outlets that open on each trunk segment; the outlets shown in Figure 1e correspond to
13
14
15 149 outlet type 1, characterised by small, multiple openings. The granular cell in Figure 1c may
16
17
18
19 150 be also a type of glandular cells, whereas the presence of glandular cell outlets was not
20
21
22 151 confirmed in the present observation. Several types of gland cell have been described in
23
24
25 152 many kinorhynchs and some studies have reported a mucus layer on the trunk surface [11,
26
27
28 153 12]. The trunk segments of E. komatsui are densely covered with cuticular hairs and these
29
30
31
32
154 hairs appear to prevent the loss of the hydrophilic coat. Dense hairs covering on the trunk
33
34
35 155 segments are shown in many Echinoderes species [9, 10, 11, 13], and the hairs may have a
36
37
38 156 similar function at least in intertidal and shallow-water species that usually face a threat of
39
40
41 157 attaching air bubbles on their body surface. Among the parts of the body, the anterior part was
42
43
44
158 less hydrophilic than the middle and posterior parts, and recovery of wettability in this part
45
46
47
48 159 did not occur during the 1 h incubation period after washing treatment. Kinorhynchs always
49
50
51 160 repeat retraction and projection of the head for locomotion, and the mucus layer on the
52
53
54 161 anterior part would be more easily exfoliated than the other parts due to the active movement
55
56
57 162 of the head.

3
163 Unlike many aquatic invertebrates, kinorhynchs are thought to have a hydrophobic
4
5
6 164 body, because they are trapped on the water surface by the bubbling and blotting method. The
7
8
9 165 present study, however, shows that the body surface of E. komatsui is hydrophobic, but that
10
11
12 166 they have a hydrophilic trunk, probably due to a hydrophilic coat. We believe that bubbles
13
14
15 167 rarely adhere to the body of E. komatsui in their natural habitat. Moreover, they may expand
16
17
18
19 168 their dispersal ability by controlling the wettability of their body surface. In the habitat of E.
20
21
22 169 komatsui, breaking waves and fluctuations in water temperature produce tiny bubbles in the
23
24
25 170 water. Under normal conditions, bubbles rarely adhere to a body with a hydrophilic coat.
26
27
28 171 When the hydrophilic layer is exfoliated by disturbance under stormy conditions, the dense
29
30
31
32
172 cuticular hairs allow bubbles to more readily adhere to the body surface; the bubbles on the
33
34
35 173 hydrophobic, hairy surface are thought to get into the gap among the hairs and the cuticle and
36
37
38 174 less detachable than the bubbles on a smooth surface. Consequently, the bubbles become
39
40
41 175 attached to kinorhynchs, allowing them to float on the water surface, where they drift over
42
43
44
176 the sea, resulting in long-distance dispersal. Later, secretion of hydrophilic mucus may
45
46
47
48 177 restore wettability and the drifting animals settle on the seafloor again (Fig. 3).
49
50
51 178 The mechanisms of kinorhynch dispersal have been rarely discussed: some intertidal
52
53
54 179 species of Echinoderes are distributed along oceanic current [14], bottom current may
55
56
57 180 transport Campyloderes sp. inhabiting mainly deep seafloor [15], and Echinoderes ohtsukai

181 may expand their distribution range associated with the oyster culture [16]. The regulation of
4
5
6 182 hydrophilic/hydrophobic body surface with presence/absence of hydrophilic mucus layer
7
8
9 183 could help long-distance dispersal of kinorhynchs by drifting, especially in intertidal and
10
11
12 184 shallow-water Echinoderes like E. komatsui. It will be interesting to investigate the
13
14
15 185 wettability of other kinorhynchs inhabiting subtidal and deeper zones and examine whether
16
17
18
19 186 they have an ability to regulate the wettability in a future study. In addition, some other
20
21
22 187 interstitial organisms are trapped by the bubbling and blotting method, such as ostracods,
23
24
25 188 tanaids, harpaticoids and nematodes; they would have hydrophobic body surface as
26
27
28 189 kinorhynchs have, and they may possess similar or other mechanisms controlling the
29
30
31
32
190 wettability of their body surface. It is also possible that the regulation of the wettability may
33
34
35 191 involve other functions that are valuable to meiobenthic organisms.

Regarding Figure 2,

17 on the body, so that the reader can easily understand not only the method of
18 contact angle measurement but also see the actual shape of droplet on the
19
20 body.

2. I recommend to add "Electronic supplementary material (ESM): EMS4.docx"
27

29
30 behavior of Echinoderes komatsui in the water, or combining with Figure 2 would
31 be fine.

49 Review of MS “Does the kinorhynch have a hydrophobic body surface?
50
51 Measurement of the wettability of a meiobenthic metazoan”
52
53
54 The MS raises a highly interesting question about the physico-chemical
55
properties of the kinorhynch cuticle, which has never been even asked before in
56
57 this way. The experimental procedure is also straightforward. There are several

59
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 22 of 30
1
2
3
4
5
problems in the MS, but these should be overcome with not too many efforts,
6
7 especially since 4 authors are involved, who can share the workload.
8
9
10 Introduction and Discussion put the study in a larger frame of the wettability of
11
12 the cuticle of invertebrates and draw conclusions about the way of distribution of
13
14
Kinorhyncha at large. Unfortunately, the article suffers from the extremely few
15 citations and the lack of considering the evolution within Kinorhyncha, so the MS
16
17 does not really meat up with the expectations raised. I suggest to focus on
18 Kinorhyncha and here especially on the so-called “E. coulli-group”. I also
19
20 suggest to include considerably more references of other scientist’s work
21
22 especially about Kinorhyncha and here about TEM studies of the cuticle and
23 gland cells on trunk and head or about the cuticular surface (e.g., cuticular hairs)
24
25 of other species of Echinoderes. Several more suggestions are found in the MS
26
itself. Of course, these references should also be discussed in more details.
27
28 It should be noted (p. 4, l. 45) that almost all kinorhynchs can be extracted with
29
30 the bubble & blot method except the obligate intertidal species Echinoderes
31 coulli (see Neuhaus 2013: p. 333) and probably related species of Echinoderes.
32
33 It should be kept in mind that the species-rich genus Echinoderes collects a
34
broad variety of species with different evolutionary lines. And one line certainly
35
36 represents a group with E. coulli, E. komatsui of the MS, and other (almost)
37
38 exclusively intertidal species of Echinoderes with very distinct protonephridial
39 openings (called “E.coulli-group”) ; these species are certainly more closely
40
41 related to each other than to any other species of Echinoderes; this hypothesis
42
43
has been uttered in several publications, which are not cited here.
44 The conclusions drawn for E. komatsui are extended to all kinorhynchs in the
45
46 Discussion chapter of the MS, but considering the morphological and ecological
47 specific characters of a closely related group of species of Echinoderes with
48
49 specific protonephridial openings and occurrence in the intertidal habitat, the
50
51 conclusions in the MS should be worded more carefully. It is much more likely
52 that the results of the current study are valid only for the above mentioned “E.
53
54 coulli-group” and not for Kinorhyncha at large. Distribution of this specific group
55
of species of Echinoderes by attachment to the water surface doe not seem
56
57 unlikely, but this method does not work for subtidal species. The latter are more

certainly distributed by bottom currents. The discussion is not totally clear about
6
7 these differences.
8
9
10 We added the following sentences at the beginning of the second paragraph
11
12 of Introduction.
13
14
" Species of the phylum Kinorhyncha are marine, meiobenthic metazoans that
15 occur in various marine sediments; e.g., mud, fine sand and coarse shell sand.
16
17 They are distributed in the intertidal zone to the abyssal depths from the polar
18 to the tropical regions. Almost all kinorhynchs can be extracted with the bubble
19
20 & blot method [7, 8], except some obligate intertidal species [9]."
21
22 [9] is Neuhaus (2013).
23
24
25 We rewrote the last paragraph in Discussion as bellow.
26
"The mechanisms of kinorhynch dispersal have been rarely discussed: some
27
28 intertidal species of Echinoderes are distributed along oceanic current [14],
29
30 bottom current may transport Campyloderes sp. inhabiting mainly deep
31 seafloor [15], and Echinoderes ohtsukai may expand their distribution range
32
33 associated with the oyster culture [16]. The regulation of
34
hydrophilic/hydrophobic body surface with presence/absence of hydrophilic
35
36 mucus layer could help long-distance dispersal of kinorhynchs by drifting,
37
38 especially in intertidal and shallow-water Echinoderes like E. komatsui. It will
39 be interesting to investigate the wettability of other kinorhynchs inhabiting
40
41 subtidal and deeper zones and examine whether they have an ability to
42
43
regulate the wettability in a future study. In addition, some other interstitial
44 organisms are trapped by the bubbling and blotting method, such as
45
46 ostracods, tanaids, harpaticoids and nematodes; they would have
47 hydrophobic body surface as kinorhynchs have, and they may possess similar
48
49 or other mechanisms controlling the wettability of their body surface. It is also
50
51 possible that the regulation of the wettability may involve other functions that
52 are valuable to meiobenthic organisms."
53
54
55
Whereas we dealt with only one species, E. komatsui, in the present study,
56
57 this is the first report on the meiobenthic organisms trapped by bubbling &

blotting method. Thus, it is reasonable to discuss the potential importance of
6
7 the wettability for meiobenthos.
8
9
10 p. 5: I have several questions about the experimental design, the text does not
11
12 fully explain important details of the experiment; please see comments in the
13
14
MS.
15 We respond to the all commentson the PDF. See "To comments on PDF"
16
17 below.
18
19
20 p. 8, l. 126: The last sentence on the page remains a bit too general and too
21
22 imprecise. The authors observed that there were gland cells, which probably
23 secreted something through the cuticle, because the authors observed pores
24
25 through the cuticle above a gland cell (Fig. 1d). It is neither documented to which
26
type of gland cell outlet Fig. 1c refers to (Yamasaki & Fujimoto 2014 distinguish
27
28 2 types of gland cell outlets), nor on which segment the gland cell outlet was
29
30 found. This is not a comprehensive morphological basis for far-reaching
31 conclusions in the Discussion. And the authors observed some detritus at a
32
33 short distance from the surface of the cuticle (Fig. 1c). Unfortunately, the authors
34
did not try any light microscopical staining tests to figure out whether there would
35
36 be indead some relationship between the contents of the gland cells and the
37
38 mucus, which is postulated but not demonstrated by the TEM studies. I strongly
39 recommend to try such light microscopical tests, which should not be too difficult
40
41 to conduct. Without the test, the suggestion that gland cell outlets secrete some
42
43
mucus is not unlikely to which detritus attaches, but evidence could be provided
44 easily with a staining test for mucus. The current study seems to be incomplete
45
46 without this test.
47
48
49 We could not specify the trunk segment in Fig. 1d strictly. The type of the
50
51 gland cell was discussed in the second paragraph of discussion based on the
52 structure of the openings.
53
54 Following the recommendation, we tried vital staining with several dyes (e.g.
55
toluidine blue, hematoxylin, and rose Bengal). However, we could not
56
57 visualize the mucus layer, whereas some insoluble materials in the

hematoxylin cover the cuticle, suggesting the presence of invisible material
6
7 the body. We added the image of histological section in which debris cover the
8
9 cuticle of the animal. In materials and methods, we added "Thick sections
10 were stained with toluidine blue for light microscopy," to describe the staining
11
12 for the histological section.
13
14
15 Fig. 1: Fig. 1 is provided at a low magnification although it contains some of the
16
17 most valuable information about the morphological characters of the cuticle. I
18 suggest to bring the plate at least to the full width of the journal in order to allow
19
20 the reader to really see the details.
21
22 We enlarged the TEM images as suggested.
23
24
25 Fig. 2, Tab. 1, EMS1.xls: Fig. 2 and Tab. 1 show actually the same data. I
26
recommend to present the original data in the main text and include them in Tab.
27
28 1 in order to allow the reader to read and understand the whole story more easily.
29
30 Please note in the introductory explanation of the annotation marked with an
31 asterisk in EMS1.xls that kinorhynchs do not possess a tail but lateral terminal
32
33 spines.
34
We modified Table 1 as suggested and deleted Figure 2.
35
36 We changed "tail" to "lateral terminal spines".
37
38
39 EMS4docx: I strongly suggest to include the illustration about the wettability of
40
41 the kinorhynch cuticle now presented as “Electronic Supplementary Material 4”
42
43
into the publication, because this visualization of the authors’ core hypothesis is
44 too important to publish it as supplementary, which may or may not be read by
45
46 the readers.

9 To my knowledge, aquatic insects and crustaceans like ostracods do have a
10 hydrophobic cuticle. Actually, the hydrophobous property of the cuticle is used to
11
12 extract both ostracods (see Müller 1894) and kinorhynchs (see Zelinka 1928)
13
14
from marine sediment.
15 We changed "such as kinorhynchs" to "such as kinorhynchs and some

36 What do you mean with "conventional method"? Please describe briefly this

21
22 It should be stated clearly that the experiments refer to the trunk region and not
23 to the head, which is usually withdrawn if a specimen is disturbed/out of its

32
33
34
How was the specimen placed on the glass slide: with an Irwin-loop traditionally
35
36 used for meiofauna or with a Pasteur pipette? The Irwin-loop may cause some
37
38 mechanical stress to the cuticle's surface. What happened with the excessive
39 water, if a specimen was placed on a glass slide if a pipette was used? Was the
40
41 animal blotted dry or did the authors wait until the seawater had evaporated?
42

11
12 discussed in more detail?
13
14
We rewrote the first sentence of this paragraph and re-assigned the regions
15 as "anterior (neck + anterior trunk), middle (middle trunk), and posterior parts
16
17 (posterior trunk)".

39 possess abundant hairs (for comparison see Neuhaus 2013: Figs 5.1.20 -5.1.23

41 or other original publications).
42
43
We changed the sentence as bellow.
44 "Dense hairs covering on the trunk segments are shown in many Echinoderes
45
46 species [9, 10, 11, 13], and the hairs may have a similar function at least in
47 intertidal and shallow-water species that usually face a threat of attaching air

Appendix D
Response to Referees
We thank generous advices and corrections of the reviewers and editors for our
manuscript.
Comments to the Author(s)
Figs 2, 3: Both figures are very important for the understanding of the paper.
Therefore, I strongly recommend to enlarge the figures to width of the page.
Both figures are not sharp in the images provided for the review process. This is
understandable for the high speed camera-image of Fig. 2 but not for the
drawing of Fig. 3. I hope the quality of Fig. 3 can be improved.
The qualities of figures on the manuscript PDF were automatically decreased
for downsizing when we submit the files via the journal web site. Therefore,
the image files we had uploaded were much better than those on the
manuscript PDF. The original file for Fig. 2 is 170 x40 mm (300 dpi: TIFF
format) and this image is the best resolution of our high speed camera system.
The original file for Fig. 3 is vector format (EPS) that was converted to bitmap
of lower resolution on the manuscript PDF. Thus, the figures on the published
version should be much better than those on the manuscript PDF. We expect
that Fig. 3 will appear as a full-width figure on the publication, as the reviewer
recommended.
few suggestions concerning the language are found directly in the manuscript.
We corrected all errors and the duplication o references indicated on the
manuscript PDF.
