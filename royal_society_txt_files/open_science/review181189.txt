This study investigated the adsorption process of ethanol molecules on Al surface using ReaxFF
MD simulations. Two adsorption modes were identified and the effects of different temperatures
and pressures on the adsorption process were studied. The results of system energy and RDF
were also presented to describe the adsorption process. Overall, the results are interesting but the
importance of the findings was not established and the scope and depth of the study are very
limited. Moreover, several issues need to be addressed.
1. The English of this manuscript needs to be improved. There are numerous minor grammatical
as well as some typo errors (e.g. Page 6, Line 23: Am; Page 13, Line 51: Struvture; Page 16, Line
27: 'Show a similar trend that changes with temperature'?). Also, the presentation of this
manuscript is poor (e.g. the font size of all the figures is not consistent; the font size changes from
Page 13, Line 58; Page 6, Line 46: '3.1 section' should be '4.1 section'; Fig. 6 does not show which
subfigure refers to which temperature). The manuscript should be carefully checked before
submission.
2. The authors used different numbers of ethanol molecules to control the pressure. Please specify
the exact initial pressure value for each simulation case (i.e. 50, 100, 150 and 200 ethanol
molecules at 200 K).
3. The algorithm for calculation of adsorbed molecules could be optimized. For the first
adsorption mode, although the authors mentioned that the oxygen atom always heads to the
surface Al atoms in the single-molecule adsorption case, other adsorptions such as Al-H could
also happen for multi-molecule adsorption. For the second adsorption mode, the authors used
the subtraction of total molecule number and number of ethanol molecules outside the
adsorption region as the number of adsorbed molecules. However, this number includes the
decomposed ethanol molecules, which should not be counted as the adsorbed ethanol molecules.
Therefore, a better method to calculate the number of adsorbed ethanol molecules may be
developed.
4. Page 11, Line 51-53: 'In the end, cases ...... 65 ethanol molecules at most'. It is not clear why the
maximum number of adsorbed ethanol molecules is 65. Based on Fig. 6b-6d (200 molecules case),
the number of adsorbed ethanol molecules could continue to increase provided that the
simulation time is long enough.
5. The authors mentioned in Section 3.3 (Page 6, Line 54) 'a timestep of 0.5 fs is enough', which
indicates that the 0.5 fs timestep was used for all the MD simulations. But in Conclusion (Page 16,
Line 36-37), the authors stated 'Simulation with timestep 0.1 fs'. Please clarify this.
6. The authors validated the ReaxFF force field used in this study by comparing its results of
binding energies with DFT calculations. But is there any experimental evidence that can support
the ReaxFF MD simulation results obtained from this research?
3
7. The adsorption is said to consist of three stages. In reality, the first two stages may not be
distinguishable. The third stage is said to be zero. What does it mean?
8. Temperature is said to enhance adsorption (only) but temperature may also promote
desorption too. Can the conclusion be of any general value, especially when the temperature
range investigated is very limited.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This manuscript has a clear research topic and is suitable for Royal Society Open Science.
Although the research is a little common and lack of innovation in some degree, the authors
combine QM calculations and MD simulations in the process of ethanol’s adsorption onto Al
(111) under different temperatures and pressures. The employed methods and data analysis are
both reasonable and scientific.
However, the pictures in this manuscript still have large space to be made better, such as Figure
1, the degree scales on vertical axis are too dense and small, same problems are also in Figure 5
and 8. The quality of pictures in Figure 5 and 8 is poor, the readers even cannot identify the
details. Additionally, in Figure 10, there are no (a)-(d) in your RDF plots corresponding to figure
caption. The other colored pictures, such as Figure 2 and 9 still need to be improved.
Overall, this work has scientific analysis and reasonable explanation for simulation phenomena,
but some issues are still in this manuscript, a major revision is necessary before reconsideration.
Some comments in details:
1. Your conclusion did not reflect your research result, in fact, your conclusion is only a copy of
your abstract, especially the first half of Section Conclusion.
2. In the caption of Figure 8, I think that “different ethanol molecules at 300K” should be
“different numbers of ethanol molecule”. Similar in caption of Figure 6, “Al slab at different
4
temperature” should be “Al slab at different temperatures”, more important, what are different
temperatures? Why not notice temperature values in figure caption? This kind of inappropriate
description frequently appear in the manuscript, the authors should pay more attentions on
English writing.
3. On page 13, line 51, the subheading “4.2.2 intermolecular struvture”, I think should be
“intermolecular structure”, this kind of careless errors need to be avoided in the writing,
especially in scientific manuscripts. The similar problems should be revised by the authors.
4. In Section 4.2.2, the authors mentioned “the most interesting g(r) functions is the O-Al
bonding”, in molecular dynamics simulations, the molecular and atomic interactions are
common, RDF reflect the structure of atom (group) around one specific atom (group). However,
how the authors can define the O-Al bonding in the adsorption of ethanol molecules on Al (111)?
Can the authors explain it? Maybe under high temperature and pressure, there will be some
chemical bonding forming. There is an obvious difference between physical interaction and
chemical bonding.
5. In the description of Figure 6, when the number of ethanol molecule is 150, there is an obvious
decreasing trend of adsorbed molecule number from 300K to 400K, while in cases of containing
200 ethanol molecules at 300K, 400K or 500K, the final adsorption number reach 65. How do the
authors explain this abnormal phenomenon?
6. which indicates the Al slab used in this paper that can adsorb 65 ethanol molecules at most.
7. The cited references are old and less. Some important recent references need to be added. As
far as we know, some related work about adsorption of single/multiple molecule(s) onto two-
dimensional materials can be referred in your introduction or corresponding section, such as, (1)
Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2017, 19(43): 29222-29231; (2) Carbon, 2014, 78: 500-509; (3) J Phys
Chem Lett, 2018, 9(15): 4396-4400; (4) The Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 2018, 122(21): 11385-
11391.
8. The format of cited references in your manuscript is inconsistent, some titles (Ref. 3-6) are
capital at the beginning of a sentence, but some titles (Ref. 7, 10, 11, 14, 16) are capital letter in
every word or for the whole of title.

Appendix A
Response to Reviewers
Dear editor, we have answered reviewer’s comments item by item. Both
the content and the format of this paper have been greatly improved.
The general improved content information is listed as follows:
--- 4.2 section was added to study the mechanism of single ethanol
molecule adsorption which also includes simulations for the ethyl and
hydroxyl groups.
--- 11 new figures and 3 new tables were added.
--- The method for counting adsorbed molecules was improved to be
more scientific. The detail discussion can be found in the 14th page.
--- The conclusion was also modified to adapt the new content.
We expected the paper can reach the publish criterion this time. Here
are our detail responses:
To Reviewer 1:
1) Language was improved to ensure no minor mistakes appear; All
figures in the revised paper were reproduced for better performance.
2) Initial pressure information was listed as Table 1.
3) The algorithm for calculation of adsorbed molecules has been
optimized. Based on analyses of section 4.2, we developed a new
method to consider physical adsorption and chemisorption at the same
time. We also assigned ID numbers for each ethanol molecule to make
the method more reasonable.
4) It is our fault to present such statement. Actually, after updating the
counting method, the analysis process and relevant figures have
changed. Detail information can be found in the Figure 11.
5) This sentence has been replaced by “Simulations with timestep 0.1 fs
shows that the hydroxyl group plays an important role in the adsorption
process of ethanol molecules.” In the revised paper, there are two kinds
of simulations which were interpreted in section 4.2 and 4.3 respectively.
6) The ReaxFF force field used in this paper was specially trained for
Al-C-H-O-N system and comparison of its results with experiments can
be found in Ref 7.
7) Due to the fact that we have changed counting method, the conclusion
was also changed a little. After our analysis and judgement, the
adsorption process consisted of two periods now.
8) We have changed our way of expression. The temperature and
pressure are two interrelated factors exerting influence on the adsorption
process. Because of the new counting method, physical adsorption and
chemisorption were considered at the same time which can detect the
occurrence of any kind of adsorption phenomenon.
As mentioned in introduction section, we focus on process of ANPs
coated by ethanol at room temperature and preserved under relatively
low temperatures. Properties of coating ANPs under high temperature
and reactions with oxygen will be studied in further researches.
To Reviewer 2:
1) The conclusion section has been rewritten completely according to
the new content we added and modified in the revised paper.
2) All figures have been reproduced for better performance and
corresponding subtitles have been improved too.
3) The subtitle of section 4.3.2 has been replaced by “Intermolecular
Structure”. We have also checked the spelling of text carefully to ensure
such faults appear in the revised paper.
4) All RDF results were calculated by VMD code and calculation
settings were shown in section 4.3.2.
5) After we adopted the new counting method, our findings and
conclusion were also changed. The new counting method was discussed
detailly in section 4.2 which can detect physical adsorption and
chemisorption at the same time.
6) Maximum number of adsorbed molecules is not within the scope of
this study. We focus on the adsorption mechanism of ethanol molecules
and its adsorption characteristics under low temperatures. Such
expressions have been deleted in the revised paper.
7) Thanks for your reference recommendations, it really helps us a lot.
We carried out charge analyses like those references and make the
revised paper more scientific. All references recommended were
inserted in introduction section.
8) All references mentioned have been retyped and the format of
references is unified.

Comments to the Author(s)
This study investigated the adsorption process of ethanol molecules on
Al surface using ReaxFF MD simulations. Two adsorption modes were
identified and the effects of different temperatures and pressures on the
adsorption process were studied. The results of system energy
and RDF were also presented to describe the adsorption process.
Overall, the results are interesting but the importance of the findings
was not established and the scope and depth of the study are very limited.
Moreover, several issues need to be addressed.
1. The English of this manuscript needs to be improved. There are
numerous minor grammatical as well as some typo errors (e.g. Page 6,
Line 23: Am; Page 13, Line 51: Struvture; Page 16, Line 27: 'Show a
similar trend that changes with temperature'?). Also, the presentation of
this manuscript is poor (e.g. the font size of all the figures is not
consistent; the font size changes from Page 13, Line 58; Page 6, Line
46: '3.1 section' should be '4.1 section'; Fig. 6 does not show which
subfigure refers to which temperature). The manuscript should be
carefully checked before submission.
2. The authors used different numbers of ethanol molecules to control
the pressure. Please specify the exact initial pressure value for each
simulation case (i.e. 50, 100, 150 and 200 ethanol molecules at 200 K).
3. The algorithm for calculation of adsorbed molecules could be
optimized. For the first adsorption mode, although the authors
mentioned that the oxygen atom always heads to the surface Al atoms
in the single-molecule adsorption case, other adsorptions such as Al-H
could also happen for multi-molecule adsorption. For the second
adsorption mode, the authors used the subtraction of total molecule
number and number of ethanol molecules outside the adsorption region
as the number of adsorbed molecules. However, this number includes
the decomposed ethanol molecules, which should not be counted as the
adsorbed ethanol molecules. Therefore, a better method to calculate the
number of adsorbed ethanol molecules may be developed.
4. Page 11, Line 51-53: 'In the end, cases ...... 65 ethanol molecules at
most'. It is not clear why the maximum number of adsorbed ethanol
molecules is 65. Based on Fig. 6b-6d (200 molecules case), the number
of adsorbed ethanol molecules could continue to increase provided that
the simulation time is long enough.
5. The authors mentioned in Section 3.3 (Page 6, Line 54) 'a timestep of
0.5 fs is enough', which indicates that the 0.5 fs timestep was used for
all the MD simulations. But in Conclusion (Page 16, Line 36-37), the
authors stated 'Simulation with timestep 0.1 fs'. Please clarify this.
6. The authors validated the ReaxFF force field used in this study by
comparing its results of binding energies with DFT calculations. But is
there any experimental evidence that can support the ReaxFF MD
simulation results obtained from this research?
7. The adsorption is said to consist of three stages. In reality, the first
two stages may not be distinguishable. The third stage is said to be zero.
What does it mean?
8. Temperature is said to enhance adsorption (only) but temperature may
also promote desorption too. Can the conclusion be of any general value,
especially when the temperature range investigated is very limited.

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript has a clear research topic and is suitable for Royal
Society Open Science. Although the research is a little common and lack
of innovation in some degree, the authors combine QM calculations and
MD simulations in the process of ethanol’s adsorption onto Al (111)
under different temperatures and pressures. The employed methods and
data analysis are both reasonable and scientific.
However, the pictures in this manuscript still have large space to be
made better, such as Figure 1, the degree scales on vertical axis are too
dense and small, same problems are also in Figure 5 and 8. The quality
of pictures in Figure 5 and 8 is poor, the readers even cannot identify
the details. Additionally, in Figure 10, there are no (a)-(d) in your RDF
plots corresponding to figure caption. The other colored pictures, such
as Figure 2 and 9 still need to be improved.
Overall, this work has scientific analysis and reasonable explanation for
simulation phenomena, but some issues are still in this manuscript, a
major revision is necessary before reconsideration.
Some comments in details:
1. Your conclusion did not reflect your research result, in fact, your
conclusion is only a copy of your abstract, especially the first half of
Section Conclusion.
2. In the caption of Figure 8, I think that “different ethanol molecules at
300K” should be “different numbers of ethanol molecule”. Similar in
caption of Figure 6, “Al slab at different temperature” should be “Al
slab at different temperatures”, more important, what are different
temperatures? Why not notice temperature values in figure caption?
This kind of inappropriate description frequently appear in the
manuscript, the authors should pay more attentions on English writing.
3. On page 13, line 51, the subheading “4.2.2 intermolecular struvture”,
I think should be “intermolecular structure”, this kind of careless errors
need to be avoided in the writing, especially in scientific manuscripts.
The similar problems should be revised by the authors.
4. In Section 4.2.2, the authors mentioned “the most interesting g(r)
functions is the O-Al bonding”, in molecular dynamics simulations, the
molecular and atomic interactions are common, RDF reflect the
structure of atom (group) around one specific atom (group). However,
how the authors can define the O-Al bonding in the adsorption of
ethanol molecules on Al (111)? Can the authors explain it? Maybe under
high temperature and pressure, there will be some chemical bonding
forming. There is an obvious difference between physical interaction
and chemical bonding.
5. In the description of Figure 6, when the number of ethanol molecule
is 150, there is an obvious decreasing trend of adsorbed molecule
number from 300K to 400K, while in cases of containing 200 ethanol
molecules at 300K, 400K or 500K, the final adsorption number reach
65. How do the authors explain this abnormal phenomenon?
6. which indicates the Al slab used in this paper that can adsorb 65
ethanol molecules at most.
7. The cited references are old and less. Some important recent
references need to be added. As far as we know, some related work
about adsorption of single/multiple molecule(s) onto two-dimensional
materials can be referred in your introduction or corresponding section,
such as, (1) Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2017, 19(43): 29222-29231; (2)
Carbon, 2014, 78: 500-509; (3) J Phys Chem Lett, 2018, 9(15): 4396-
4400; (4) The Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 2018, 122(21): 11385-
11391.
8. The format of cited references in your manuscript is inconsistent,
some titles (Ref. 3-6) are capital at the beginning of a sentence, but some
titles (Ref. 7, 10, 11, 14, 16) are capital letter in every word or for the
whole of title.

Reviewer: 1
The revision is satisfactory and the paper is acceptable for publication
after minor corrections. The detailed comments are:
Q1: The English and presentation of this manuscript have been
improved. But there are still many errors. For example, Page 1, Line 48:
keep them (their) chemical activity; Page 1, Line 50: Al2O3, 2 & 3
should be subscripts; Page 2, Lines 15-16: there are still lack studies
interpret interactions; Page, Line 17: ‘detail’ should be ‘detailed’; Page
2, Line 27: We put our research focus on; Page 5, Line 34: are not ideal
too (either); Page 5, Line 53: r0, pbo, 0 & bo should be subscripts; Page
6, Line 16: Egroup, Epair, group & pair should be subscripts; Page 8,
Line 21: ‘begins’ should be ‘began’; Page 9, Line 30: there were two
peaks appear; Page 18, Line 4: Ri+N/2, i+N/2 should be subscript. I
would suggest the authors do a thorough check and correct these errors.
Q2: Table 1 shows ‘Atomic effective charges of ethanol model’. Where
is the initial pressure information?
Q3: Revision accepted.
