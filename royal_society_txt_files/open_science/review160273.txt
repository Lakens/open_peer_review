This is a worthwhile and clearly written paper. I have one basic point I think needs to be
addressed, and a few minor comments.
Main comment
The authors state that the Gabor stimuli contain two cues: the “feature cue” provided by the
Gabor carrier, and the “envelope cue” provided by the envelope. Since these always had the same
disparity, I don’t find it particularly helpful to think of these as different cues. Rather, I find it
helpful to think in terms of the Fourier spectrum of the stimuli. Narrow-band Gabors have a
Gaussian Fourier spectrum with a peak at the carrier frequency. Gaussians have a Gaussian
Fourier spectrum with a peak at DC (lowpass). The most obvious hypothesis would seem to be
that stereoacuity is limited by the highest frequencies present in the image (above some limiting
power), after accounting for blurring by the eye’s optics and any filter. So I would like to see
evidence against this hypothesis before we think about other models, e.g. the two-mechanism
model introduced by the authors. What happens if the authors try a model where stereoacuity is
proportional to 1/fmax, where fmax is the highest frequency where the Fourier spectrum of the
image exceeds some critical amplitude Acrit. It seems to me that with a suitable choice of Acrit,
this simple model might well give a reasonable qualitative account of the data in all 84 conditions
(both Gaussian and Gabor, for all 6 filters and 7 extents). At the least I think it needs to be shown
that this simple account fails (discussing it alongside Hess & Wilcox 1994, Schor and Wood 1983
etc).
Minor comments
“Note that Gn has the same extent as Vn”. So did the Gabor envelope vary with 1/SF? This needs
to be stated explicilty.
“V1, 2 ,… where the number denotes the SF”. To 1sf only, since the lowest SF was 1.25cpd. Were
the other SFs integers?
“In the RH column of Fig 2, the x axis is reversed” – given this, it is particularly important to label
more than 1 tick mark.

appreciate it is the same as Fig 3

Summary:
The authors employ a well-controlled paradigm to examine the impact of unilateral low-pass
filtering on stereoacuity for Gaussian and difference of Gaussian test stimuli. This is a very well
executed experiment and the data and analyses are high quality, and the paper is very well
written. My only concern with the paper is its somewhat unclear connection between the
experiment and anisometropia. I think the introduction could be improved to better connect this
experiment with the important clinical condition known to generate unilateral defocus.
Consider a slightly modified version of this experiment in which the test stimuli were even more
narrow band than the DOGs. In such a case, this would be a study of the impact of interocular
differences in contrast on stereo acuity, but instead of modulating the contrast difference with the
displayed stimulus, the Bangerter filters were used. At any single SF, these filters will, of course,
just reduced contrast (more at high than at low SFs). In the end, because DOG stimuli are
reasonably narrow band, this experiment more closely reflects an experiment in which
interocular contrast differences, not interocular defocus differences are introduced. The missing
key characteristic of anisometropia is the dramatic differences in spatial bandwidth of the focused
and defocused right and left eye images, and this difference in bandwidth is almost completely
removed by employing the narrow bandwidth stimuli used in this project.
4
I do feel, however, that raising the anosmetropia question in the discussion would be very
valuable, because the data here seem to support the explanation suggested by Hess, Liu and
Wang that it is the interocular contrast differences (in the region of SFs that are present in both
eyes but demodulated in one) that prevent these signals from being effective for stereopsis when
defocus is unilateral, but they can be used when defocus is bilateral. It seems to me that the
current experiment provides convincing evidence to support the Hess et al hypothesis, and it
would be nice for the discussion to explore this connection to either support of reject this earlier
hypothesis for why monocular defocus selectively degrades stereo acuity.
Specifics:
P3, line 36: I complement the authors for collecting together this list of studies of monocular
defocus, but it would be appropriate to include the earlier, and very excellent study of this topic
by Alfred Lit (1968/9 I believe).
P5, 27-37. Some clarifying language would help the reader understand the intended dual role of
the E characters on the display. I am familiar with these methods, but could not quite understand
what the authors did. For example, are all E’s presented binocularly?
P5, line 50: DO the authors mean the disparity DIFFERENCES between the target Garbors AND
their reference stimuli?
P6, line 27: Here the authors might emphasize the value of these not truly anisometropic filters,
and clarify the important differences between the effect of these filters and the effects of optical
defocus (because Anisometropia is used as the motivator for this study).
P7. Line 29: Some comment on how the pixel resolution of 20 arc seconds affected the ability to
generate small horizontal disparities would be helpful.
P8, 3-6: It is not clear how an apple can be the inverse of an orange. Perhaps delete this
statement.
P8, 6-9. Of course, the current study is not the first to observe that defocus affects high spatial
frequency STIMULI more than low. Perhaps re-write this sentence to achieve intended goal.
P8, 25-32. Here we meet theoretical lack of clarity in this paper. The authors reveal that filtering
out high SFs (quantified by VA data) has little impact on visual performance with low SF stimuli.
This is of course, to be expected. Perhaps connect this description of the data to the obvious
optical reality. This point appears again on p12.
Discussion: Missing from the discussion was some clarification and discussion of the question
addressed by (all?) the previous studies of monocular defocus and stereopsis: does monocular
defocus have more or less effect than binocular defocus? The current study did not employ
bilateral filters as a reference condition, but the discussion should dig deeply into this topic given
the original motivation outlined in the introduction.

We very much appreciate this reviewer’s insightful comments. We have included this important
nt in the Discussion (first paragraph): “…When dealing with complex natural visual scenes containing
erent spatial frequency components (i.e. broadband visual stimuli), it is likely that performance is
ted by the higher spatial frequencies in the image. Indeed, previous studies speculate that with higher
tial frequencies being removed, visual blur might shift stereo processing to lower spatial frequencies
sing an elevation of threshold in proportional to the dominant spatial frequency [43]…”. We do agree
h the reviewer that our observers did not seem to make use of the envelope cue even when it could
entially provide better stereoacuity performance (P14, first paragraph). However, we also note that
the Gabor stimuli used here, rotating the carrier grating by 90 degrees (from vertical to horizontal),
ults in a very large increase in stereo thresholds (see Fig. 2 of Li et al., RSOS 2016). In this case, the
izontal carrier grating does not provide useful information for stereopsis, and the observer must rely
he Gaussian envelope. A comprehensive computational ideal observer model which fully takes
ount of various limiting mechanisms is needed in order to simulate/explain human performance in
red conditions in future studies.

Thanks a lot for your insightful suggestion! We agree that it would be very interesting to examine the
cts of monocular blur versus binocular blur on stereoacuity using narrow bandwidth stimuli. In fact,
are currently addressing this fundamental question in our ongoing follow-up experiments. We hope

27-37. Some clarifying language would help the reader understand the intended dual role of the E
racters on the display. I am familiar with these methods, but could not quite understand what the
hors did. For example, are all E’s presented binocularly?
Clarified on P5. The two ‘E’s presented binocularly at the top-right and bottom-left corners served
n accommodation lock for bringing the visual stimulus in focus. The ‘E’s presented monocularly at
top-left (only seen by the left eye) and bottom-right corners (only seen by the right eye) served as a
ocular status indicator ensuring the absence of monocular suppression during testing, and proper
nment (when perceived to be one above the other).
line 50: DO the authors mean the disparity DIFFERENCES between the target Garbors AND their
rence stimuli?
The sentence is rephrased as “… the amount of binocular disparity between the two target Gabors
n in each eye …”
line 27: Here the authors might emphasize the value of these not truly anisometropic filters, and
ify the important differences between the effect of these filters and the effects of optical defocus
cause Anisometropia is used as the motivator for this study).
We discuss the differences in the modulation transfer function between dichoptic blur and diffusive
on P14: “One should be cautious when generalizing our findings to uncorrected anisometropia as
gerter filters produce diffusive blur that is qualitatively different from defocus blur, notably phase
rnation with optical defocus [41]. For defocus blur, the amplitude of the modulation transfer function
F) falls below zero and then rises again, damping around zero, for higher spatial frequencies causing
rious resolution [55]. In contrast, the MTF with Bangerter filters does not fall below zero.”
Line 29: Some comment on how the pixel resolution of 20 arc seconds affected the ability to
erate small horizontal disparities would be helpful.
Sub-pixel accuracy was achieved by contrast manipulation. This technical point has been explained
P7.
3-6: It is not clear how an apple can be the inverse of an orange. Perhaps delete this statement.
That statement has been rewritten as “… The stereoacuity versus spatial frequency function is a U-
ped curve …”. (P8)
6-9. Of course, the current study is not the first to observe that defocus affects high spatial
uency STIMULI more than low. Perhaps re-write this sentence to achieve intended goal.
In the revised manuscript, we point out that narrowband stimuli were used in the current
eriments, in contrast to the broadband stimuli used in previous studies (P8 first paragraph, and also
P3 last paragraph). By using this technique, we were able to evaluate the effects of monocular blur
ndividual spatial channels selectively, spanning from coarse to fine stereopsis.
25-32. Here we meet theoretical lack of clarity in this paper. The authors reveal that filtering out
SFs (quantified by VA data) has little impact on visual performance with low SF stimuli. This is of
rse, to be expected. Perhaps connect this description of the data to the obvious optical reality. This
nt appears again on p12.
These concepts are elaborated in the Discussion (first paragraph): “… These findings are not too
prising as the Bangerter foil mostly attenuates the middle and particularly high spatial frequency
tent (roughly quantified by visual acuity), but largely spares low spatial frequencies [41] … Indeed,
vious studies speculate that with higher spatial frequencies being removed, visual blur might restrict
eo processing to lower spatial frequencies causing an elevation of threshold in proportional to the
inant spatial frequency [43]
ussion: Missing from the discussion was some clarification and discussion of the question addressed
all?) the previous studies of monocular defocus and stereopsis: does monocular defocus have more
ess effect than binocular defocus? The current study did not employ bilateral filters as a reference
dition, but the discussion should dig deeply into this topic given the original motivation outlined in
introduction.
That is indeed a good suggestion!!! We are currently investigating the effects of binocular blur
sus monocular blur on stereoacuity at different spatial scales. This point is briefly introduced in the
sed manuscript (P15, last paragraph). As mentioned earlier, we plan to answer this question with
re data in a separate line of experiments.
