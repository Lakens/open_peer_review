A flashing Brownian ratchet is a random process that alternates between a 1D Brownian motion
and a Brownian ratchet, producing directed motion in the sense that the mean displacement of an
initial probability distribution is positive after one cycle of the process. This process motivated
Parrondo’s paradox, in which two fair games of chance produce a winning game. Other
applications include thermal physics and cell biology. The main scope of this paper is to study
this process numerically via a random walk approximation.
Although the scope might seem modest, the mathematics is highly nontrivial and interesting on
its own. It is also interesting to see how to model an odd random process in such a way that
valuable information can be obtained both theoretically and numerically. The result is a fine
exercise in the intersection of stochastic processes, numerical mathematics, and modeling.
Furthermore, the paper is very well written, so that it makes for a smooth reading. In this regard,
I suggest to define explicitly the space DR[0,8) in Thm 3.1 (also appearing in Thm 3.2).
On the above grounds I recommend publication of this manuscript in Royal Society Open
Science.

In this manuscript, the authors consider the relation between the flashing Brownian ratchet and
the Parrondo games. Specifically, they develop a novel procedure, motivated and based upon the
Parrondo games, to numerically study the flashing Brownian ratchet.
Given the vast range of literature on the Parrondo paradox and the flashing ratchet, I do not see
what this work has to add to that. For example, the connection between the discrete dynamics of
the games vs the continuous description of the ratchet has been extensively investigated, cf the
doctoral thesis by Pau Amengual.

The numerical procedure outlined seems to be yet another way to simulate the flashing ratchet,
an alternative for the usual stochastic differential equation. What are the advantages to do so? Is
it computationally cheaper, faster,…? I suggest the authors to clearly express the novelty of their
procedure, and to point out precisely what distinguishes it from the existing literature.

The authors in this interesting work propose a random walk generalization of Brownian flashing
ratchet. They do so both numerically using the data from a rasterized image from Ref. 3 as well as
analytically.
I have a few queries.
1. The proof of Theorem 3.2 should be given in manuscript itself. Donsker's theorem should be
explained.
2. Why is the data extracted from figure 1 ( of Ref. 3), did the authors not make a request to
authors of Ref. 3 for the data file? It would have been far better to work with the data file of
Figure 1 from Ref. 3.
3. The website mentioned in Data accessibility points to a broken link therefore the mathematica
code couldn't be checked. I would request the authors to provide the correct link.

This paper investigates the relation between the flashing Brownian ratchet and the original
Parrondo’ effect through a random walk approximation. The connection is well known, although
the detailed mathematical derivations appear to be original and rigorous.
The results are compared numerically with the raw figures provided by Harmer (figure 1) and
Parrondo (figure 2). I suggest that they compared with the Langevin equation simulation result
directly.
Overall, the idea of their random walk approximation will be helpful for the futher analysis of
Parrodo effect and I recommend it for publication after several corrections below to be
incorporated besides the above comparison with Langevin simulation directly
(I) First of all, rewrite the paper in a more coherent way with proper heading of the section
(II) A conclusion is needed along with discussion on how these results can be used in future
analysis of the problem
(III) Here are several recent papers that the authors should add to their references, as most of the

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_5
The authors present a way of studying a flashing ratchet numerically using a random walk
approximation based on Parrondo's games. Whereas this is achieved in the paper, this is however
hardly surprising. In fact, as the authors properly acknowledge, Parrondo's games originate from
a flashing ratchet, and the connection between both systems have been thoroughly addressed
previously in the literature. As an example, just at the end of section 2 it is claimed that "game A
and (the generalized) game B leat to a new form of Parrondo's paradox". What is actually the
novelty there? Parrondo games with different modulo M have been previously shown to exist.
If there is any novelty in the article I would say it is the computation of the precise random walk
that have to be constructed to approximate the ratchet potential. However, to me, this seems
equivalent to other methods proposed as constructing the probabilities using a Metropolis
algorithm (see for example: https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0309053v2 ) except maybe the
modulo M considered. The posibility to refine the random walk for any number of space
discretization steps "n" to achieve the needed precision is somewhat interesting to me, but I do
not think this is enough to grant publication.
Furthermore, in my opinion, the strict comparison of the random walk computations with figure
1 and 2 results should be removed in any version of the article. It lacks any kind of rigor:
obviously, these figures were intended in their original publications for illustration purposes
only, not as representing actual data. I can personally assure that at least figure 2 represents
merely a hand drawing, with no intention to be accurate. It would be alright to draw similarities
between figure 4 and figures 1 and 2, but no one should expect they can closely match!
If the authors wish to compare their results with the actual behaviour of a flashing ratchet, they
should compare against a numerical simulation of the ratchet using Langevin equation or
alternatively a Fokker-Planck equation.
For these reasons I cannot recommend publication of the manuscript in its present form.
Summing up, first, a stronger effort should be done to convince the reader there is enough new
results in the paper to read it. Second, a proper comparison to Langevin or FP equation should be
carried out.

Response from the Authors:
In the revision we have explicitly defined DR [0, 8) just before Theorem 3.1.
2 Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Authors:
In this manuscript, the authors consider the relation between the flashing
Brownian ratchet and the Parrondo games. Specifically, they develop a novel
procedure, motivated and based upon the Parrondo games, to numerically study
the flashing Brownian ratchet.
Given the vast range of literature on the Parrondo paradox and the flash-
ing ratchet, I do not see what this work has to add to that. For example, the
1
connection between the discrete dynamics of the games vs the continuous de-
scription of the ratchet has been extensively investigated, cf the doctoral thesis
by Pau Amengual.
The numerical procedure outlined seems to be yet another way to simulate
the flashing ratchet, an alternative for the usual stochastic differential equation.
What are the advantages to do so? Is it computationally cheaper, faster?? I
suggest the authors to clearly express the novelty of their procedure, and to
point out precisely what distinguishes it from the existing literature.
Response from the Authors:
The reviewer questions whether there is anything new. Three things are new.
1. In Section 2, we derive a new class of capital-dependent Parrondo games
motivated by the Brownian ratchet with shape parameter a. All previous works,
to the best of our knowledge, have assumed a to be the reciprocal of an integer.
We allow a to be any rational number in (0, 1), which is more general.
2. In Section 3, we propose random walk approximations to the Brownian
ratchet and the flashing Brownian ratchet. This provides an efficient method
of numerically studying these continuous processes, which we believe is simpler
than other methods (numerical PDE) and more accurate than computer simu-
lation. It is also original, to the best of our knowledge.
3. In Sections 4 and 5 we find the approximate distributions of the flashing
Brownian ratchet at time t1 + t2 , starting at 0 and starting from a stationary
distribution associated with the wrapped flashing Brownian ratchet. The aim
was to determine how accurate the conceptual Figures 1 and 2 are. To the best
of our knowledge, this has not been done before. In particular, we have not seen
figures like Figures 4 and 5 in the literature (except for conceptual figures not
based on data).

2. Figures 1 and 2 are, as we stated, conceptual. They are quite clearly not
based on data. Nevertheless, we extracted as much information from them as
we could, namely the values of the shape parameter a and the time parameter
t1 , in order to make our figures as close to Figure 1 as practical.

The reason for comparing our figures with the conceptual Figures 1 and 2 was
to see how accurate they are. This question is what motivated our work. Our
random walk approximation method is more accurate than a simulation, based
on a random number generator, would be. Numerical solution of the Fokker–
Planck equation is beyond the scope of the paper, and in any case is outside the
authors’ areas of expertise.

are concerned with certain variants of Parrondo games, and the fourth paper
deals with a more complex model of the flashing ratchet involving inertial effects.
These papers are only marginally relevant to our problem. The second paper uses
Fourier analysis to give explicit solutions of certain Parrondo games, and is in
fact very relevant. It is now cited in Section 4.

Comments to the Authors:
The authors present a way of studying a flashing ratchet numerically using
a random walk approximation based on Parrondo’s games. Whereas this is
achieved in the paper, this is however hardly surprising. In fact, as the authors
properly acknowledge, Parrondo’s games originate from a flashing ratchet, and
the connection between both systems have been thoroughly addressed previously
in the literature. As an example, just at the end of section 2 it is claimed
that “game A and (the generalized) game B lead to a new form of Parrondo’s
paradox”. What is actually the novelty there? Parrondo games with different
modulo M have been previously shown to exist.
If there is any novelty in the article I would say it is the computation of the
precise random walk that have to be constructed to approximate the ratchet
potential. However, to me, this seems equivalent to other methods proposed
as constructing the probabilities using a Metropolis algorithm (see for exam-
ple: https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0309053v2) except maybe the modulo M
considered. The posibility to refine the random walk for any number of space
discretization steps “n” to achieve the needed precision is somewhat interesting
to me, but I do not think this is enough to grant publication.
Furthermore, in my opinion, the strict comparison of the random walk com-
putations with figure 1 and 2 results should be removed in any version of the
article. It lacks any kind of rigor: obviously, these figures were intended in their
original publications for illustration purposes only, not as representing actual
data. I can personally assure that at least figure 2 represents merely a hand
drawing, with no intention to be accurate. It would be alright to draw similar-
ities between figure 4 and figures 1 and 2, but no one should expect they can
closely match!
If the authors wish to compare their results with the actual behaviour of
a flashing ratchet, they should compare against a numerical simulation of the
ratchet using Langevin equation or alternatively a Fokker-Planck equation.
For these reasons I cannot recommend publication of the manuscript in its
present form. Summing up, first, a stronger effort should be done to convince
4
the reader there is enough new results in the paper to read it. Second, a proper
comparison to Langevin or FP equation should be carried out.
Response from the Authors:
Our response to Reviewer 2, explaining what is new, applies here as well. In
particular, the Parrondo paradox of Section 2 is new because it allows the shape
parameter a to be any rational number in (0, 1), not just the reciprocal of an
integer. Maybe we should have said “more general” instead of “new”. Of course
we meant “new” in the sense of “new level of generality”.
The Metropolis algorithm is a simulation method, and this paper has nothing
to do with simulation. Our numerical methods are much more accurate than
what one could expect from a simulation.
We disagree that the comparison with Figures 1 and 2 should be removed.
That in fact is what motivated our work. Namely, how accurate are these con-
ceptual figures? Of course, we understood that these figures were not based on
data. Still, one can ask how accurate they are, and it is surprising (at least to
us) that no one has asked or answered this question before.
Reviewer 5, like Reviewer 4, asks for analysis based on the Langevin or
Fokker-Planck equations. Our idea was to bypass these methods in favor of a
random walk approximation that we believe is at least as accurate as and perhaps
simpler than numerical PDE analysis of the FP equation. In any case, the latter
method is outside the authors’ areas of expertise.

Comments to the Authors:
I believe that the unique contribution of this paper lies in the proofs that
it contains. The paper could be made stronger by providing a short summary
section, at the end, giving a summary and possible applications of the theorems,
together with a summary of unsolved problems, and proposed future work.
Response from the Authors:
We have added a conclusion section, which includes comments on future
work.
7 Other changes
We made a few changes that were not in response to reviewers’ comments.
1. The suggested alternative parameterization, with s12 and s22 arbitrary and
t1 = t2 = 1 (see Section 1), has been modified because we realized that we need
s12 = s22 to maintain the flashing ratchet interpretation.
2. The claim that the invariant measures of Section 2 must be periodic was
correct but for the wrong reason. It is needed if we want the random walk to
be recurrent and ultimately correspond to a fair game. Furthermore, it is clear
that these random walks have a unique reversible invariant measure (existence
5
is automatic), though not necessarily a unique invariant measure. As an illus-
tration, consider the simple random walk with P (n, n + 1) = p = 1 - P (n, n - 1)
for all n. Then p(n) = (p/(1 - p))n is the unique (up to scalar multiples) re-
versible invariant measure, but p(n) = 1 is also an invariant measure that is
nonreversible (does not satisfy detailed balance) if p 6= 1/2.
3. We included a normalizing constant in the reversible invariant measure
just below (2.7) so that the mean profit calculation would make more sense.
4. There was an oversight in the definition of (Ln f )(x) (Section 3) that has
been corrected in the revision.
5. We strengthened the results of Theorem 5.1 by proving reversibility of the
invariant measure.
