GENERAL
The MS is very well written and shows clearly that the detection of polarized light could be an
important means of assisting horseflies in the visual location of hosts. Moreover, I am sure that
the MS would be of much interest to many entomologists. Hence, I have no hesitation in
recommending that the MS be accepted for publication. However, there are a few matters that the
authors might like to consider in respect of presentation and substance, as indicated below.
PRESENTATION
While the MS is written very carefully, I suspect that the authors will themselves find a few
things to improve when they read it again. I provide the following examples at the specified page
(P) and line (L) numbers.
P 1 L 54, and P2 L9.-- Split infinitives. I know that such splitting is often overlooked these days,
but since the MS is so well written in general the authors should not let themselves down in
these little matters of elegance.
P3 L47. -- I had a double take at "self-written", wondering whether the computer had written the
programme itself, rather like Excel can get VBA to produce macros to run and analyse Excel
spreadsheets . Presumably the authors mean that they themselves wrote the code for their custom
procedures.
3
P4 L27. -- Delete "with".
P5 L51. -- The format ". (number) upper case" contrasts with the earlier format of "(number) lower
case".
P7 L20. -- Here we obtained EVIDENCE that.
P7 L26. -- The meaning of "During such a round flying" is difficult to grasp quickly. Would
"during such circumnavigation" be better?
SUBSTANCE
Is the possible also the actual? -- While the authors show clearly that various ways of using
polarized light MIGHT be very useful to the flies, the MS does not show that the flies do
ACTUALLY use the light in such ways to improve the location. The reader tends to be left with
somewhat vague assertions, as for example that at P6 L39, i.e., "According to our experience
horseflies look for sunlit dark hosts". The MS would have been more powerful if it had reported
confirmatory catches made from the models under various lighting conditions and background
types.
Perspective. -- The authors make no attempt to put the importance of the perception of polarized
light into perspective with other means of host location. For example, does polarized light play
much of a role when the flies are locating mobile baits, instead of the stationary ones considered
in the MS? This is perhaps an important question since horseflies are very strongly attracted to
movement. Moreover, how important is polarized light compared to odour attraction, and does
the importance of the various sorts of light change when odour is present? Perhaps it might give
the MS a deeper perspective to include brief consideration of these matters.

Specific points that need to be addressed has been listed below.
Introduction
P2, line 4: I suggest rephrasing the first sentence since many hematophagous insects require a
blood meal for egg production. For anautogenous females, the blood meal is essential, while
4
autogenous females can lay the first eggs without blood meal (but the blood meal increase egg
production).
P2, line 13: I would use “pathogens” instead of “diseases”.
See Marcantonio et al. (2017) about scientific terminology in epidemiology.

Trends in Parasitology.
P2, lines 4-13: The first paragraph of the introduction may be sum up and moved below in the
introduction. The authors may begin the introduction with a paragraph about the polarotaxis
vision for insects and then for tabanids using the second paragraph of the discussion (“Detection
of water … become strongly polarotactic insects”).
P2, line 34: Replace “host-seeking bloodsucking female horseflies” by “host-seeking females”
P2, line 44: Use preferentially “horse fly females” in the manuscript
P2, line 49: “to take a blood meal” rather than “for extracting a blood meal”
Material and methods
P3, line 32: correct “vegetation”
P3, line 54: correct “number”
Results
It is very confusing that scenes are referred as figures.
I suggest replacing Fig. 3A, Fig. 4A …and Fig. 11A by another expression such as scene, case or
experiment 1, 2 …. and 9.
Therefore, I suggest indicating in each caption the corresponded scene, case or experiment (e.g.
Fig. 3: Scene 1…), and using in the text “In the scene 1… (Fig. 3)” as an example.
The authors should mention clearly at the beginning of the results that they describe mainly one
scene (here the scene 1) since they measured the same parameters and obtained similar
conclusions with the other scenes using host model or cow.
Discussion
P5, lines 38-55: I suggest moving this part in the introduction and beginning the discussion by “In
this work we showed …”.
The authors should also discuss their results in view of field observations. For example, host-
seeking females are more active in open sunny areas than in shaded or forested areas.
Furthermore, many tabanid species have also their peak of daily activity at midday when the
sunlight is very high (See Baldacchino et al. 2014 and references herein).

Tabanids: neglected subjects of research, but important vectors of disease agents! Infect. Genet.
Evol. 28, 596–615.
May these spatial and temporal behavioural patterns be partly explained by the polarization
sensitivity of tabanids?
The authors also discussed the difference in the degree of light polarization between a dark host
animal and a shady dark region of vegetation. They concluded that a tabanid orientates toward a
dark host animal rather than a dark vegetation patch because a dark host animal is strongly
polarizing. Here, the authors focussed on visual cues used by tabanids. However, like other
hematophagous insects, tabanids use odour cues for host-seeking. I suggest that the authors also
discuss the use of both visual and odour cues by tabanid at the end of the discussion.
Authors’ conclusions are based on algorithm comparisons only. I think that these findings should
be confirmed by entomological investigations (if it can be feasible), using for example the same
host model in front of different vegetation patterns and comparing the number of tabanids
attracted by the model among the different vegetation patterns.

r: A
iticized paragraph was revised in the following way:
ding to our experience (unpublished data), horsefly females look for sunlit dark host animals,
than shady dark ones or dark patches of the optical environment (mainly vegetation). Shady dark
nimals and the dark patches of the environment are usually only weakly polarizing, while sunlit
ost animals are strongly polarizing, as demonstrated in this work. Thus, horseflies could find a
dark host by means of the high degree of polarization of host-reflected light, distinguishing it
weakly polarizing shady host and from dark environmental patches being inappropriate for
sucking. Confirmation of this prediction by capturing horseflies with host models under various
g conditions and background types could be an important task of future research.’

r: To the revised Discussion we added the following paragraph:
s work we demonstrated the importance of polarized light perception in the visual host location
seflies. We would like to emphasize that other cues may also play an important role in host
. For example, horseflies are lured by the movement of baits (Bracken et al. 1962; Allan et al.
Lehane 2005), thus their host animals are detected by motion too. Moreover, horseflies are very
y attracted to hosts by odours (Hribar et al. 1992; Hall et al. 1998; Lehane 2005; Mihok and
2010; Mihok and Lange 2012; Baldacchino et al. 2013, 2014b). However, Blahó et al. (2013)
d that dark-bright stripes, for instance, disrupt odour attractiveness to horseflies, and thus the
pattern of hosts has a dominance in the sensory system of host-seeking tabanids relative to host-
c odours (e.g. ammonia, CO2). Further studies are needed to determine the relative contributions
erent cues in the host detection by different horsefly species.’

conclusions with the other scenes using host model or cow.

more, many tabanid species also have their peak of daily activity at midday when the sunlight is
igh (Baldacchino et al. 2014c; Herczeg et al. 2014, 2015). Horsefly females prefer sunlit dark-
, especially black host animals (Horváth et al. 2010, Egri et al. 2013a), and their visual host
is partly governed by means of the degree of polarization of coat-reflected light (Kriska et al.
Egri et al. 2012a).’

e 3 wrote: Discussion - May these spatial and temporal behavioural patterns be partly
ned by the polarization sensitivity of tabanids?
r: In our opinion, these spatio-temporal behavioural patterns can be explained by the
teristics of thermoreception and thermal preference of tabanid flies, rather than by their
ation sensitivity. This is, however, not mentioned in our revised paper, because we do not want
ulate on this subject.
e 3 wrote: Discussion - The authors also discussed the difference in the degree of light

d orientates toward a dark host animal rather than a dark vegetation patch because a dark host
is strongly polarizing. Here, the authors focussed on visual cues used by tabanids. However,
her hematophagous insects, tabanids use odour cues for host-seeking. I suggest that the authors
scuss the use of both visual and odour cues by tabanid at the end of the discussion.
r: As suggested also by Referee 2, at the end of the revised Discussion we wrote:
s work we demonstrated the importance of polarized light perception in the visual host location
seflies. We would like to emphasize that other cues may also play an important role in host
. For example, horseflies are lured by the movement of baits (Bracken et al. 1962; Allan et al.
Lehane 2005), thus their host animals are detected by motion too. Moreover, horseflies are very
y attracted to hosts by odours (Hribar et al. 1992; Hall et al. 1998; Lehane 2005; Mihok and
2010; Mihok and Lange 2012; Baldacchino et al. 2013, 2014b). However, Blahó et al. (2013)
d that dark-bright stripes, for instance, disrupt odour attractiveness to horseflies, and thus the
pattern of hosts has a dominance in the sensory system of host-seeking tabanids relative to host-
c odours (e.g. ammonia, CO2). Further studies are needed to determine the relative contributions
erent cues in the host detection by different horsefly species.’

r: As suggested, at the end of the revised Discussion we wrote:
onclusions presented here are based on imaging polarimetric measurements of different scenes
eir algorithmic comparisons. In the future, these findings could be confirmed by entomological
gations, using for example the same host model in front of different vegetation patterns and
ring the number of tabanids attracted by this model among the different vegetation patterns.’
