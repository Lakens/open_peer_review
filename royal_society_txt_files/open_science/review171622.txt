Title: Discovery of benzothiazolylquinoline conjugates as novel human A3 receptor antagonist:
Biological evaluations and molecular docking studies
Article Type: Research Paper
Dear Authors,
This manuscript describes the radioligand binding data of the novel benzothiazolylquinoline
scaffolds against hA3 receptor with the molecular docking studies. The authors also reported that
compound 1a displayed best potency and selectivity at hA3 among other adenosine receptors.
This manuscript is well structured and written as well as the conclusions are supported by the
analysis of the data presented. I found the research topic interesting.
I have no further comments to the content of the article. I think that this manuscript is strongly
improved and is acceptable for publication in “Royal Society Open Science”.

The Authors of the manuscript 'Discovery of benzothiazolylquinoline conjugates as novel human
A3 receptor antagonist: biological evaluations and molecular docking studies' describe the
3
synthesis of compounds designed from molecular docking experiments. I have read the reports
from both reviewers and am happy that the Authors have addressed their concerns
appropriately. However, as I believe compounds were synthesised, spectral data needs to be
provided in the supporting information, even if these compounds have been synthesised before.
Synthetic routes also need to be described so that the reader is more informed. Based on the
guidelines set out by Royal Society Open Science, I believe that this manuscript can be accepted
as long as the supporting information is up to date.
