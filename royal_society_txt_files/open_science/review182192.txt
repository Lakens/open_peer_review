The ecology of southern salamanders differs from northern salamanders. Using state of the art
spatial capture-recapture methods, the authors show that densities and home ranges are
different. Thus, this study makes an important contribution to the growing body of studies which
document intraspecific variation among amphibian populations.
I like the methods and results sections but I don’t like the introduction and discussion.
1. Comments on the introduction:
The hypothesis is that density and home range should vary spatially. I don’t think that the
reasons given why home ranges should vary spatially are convincing (there is not much on line
103 …). I think that home ranges should depend on resources such as food, refuges and mates.
Why should it depend on the position within the species range? Is there a good theoretical
justification for this hypothesis?
Line 49. I think it would be better to cite some data papers which quantify declines rather than
general reviews. For North American amphibians, the paper by Grant et al. 2016 in Scientific
Reports would be a good choice.
Line 61, 79. A nice example is the paper by Petrovan and Schmidt 2016 in Plos One.
Line 66-67. Less favourable habitats regulate amphibian populations. Isn’t that circular
reasoning? How do you infer habitat suitability? Is habitat less suitable because abundance is
lower? Anyway, I think the sentence would be better if you would avoid the term ‘regulation’.
Regulation has a specific meaning in population ecology (see Sinclair, A. R. E. 1989. Population
regulation in animals. – In: Cherrett, J. M. (ed.), Ecological concepts. Blackwell, pp. 197–240). (I
would also avoid ‘regulation’ on lines 237 and 251.)
Line 67-70. The evidence listed for temperature as a factor regulating populations is very indirect.
I would cite some papers which actually show how temperature affects vital rates (e.g. Reading
2007 in Oecologia; I’m sure there are similar papers for terrestrial salamanders).
Line 89-90. Amburgey et al. 2018 in Global Change Biology is a good paper on how position in
the range affects amphibian population dynamics. There is also the abundance-center hypothesis
which predicts abundance in relation to position in the range.
2. Comments on the discussion:
In my opinion, the discussion is too long. I think it should be shortened (50% is possible, I think;
for example, I think the discussion of local adaptation is very speculative.) and focused on the key
results. The result is that home ranges and densities are different from home ranges and densities
elsewhere. That’s an interesting result but a long discussion is not worthwhile if you cannot
explain the causes. You would need a multi-site SCR study to test which factors affect density
and home range size.
3. Other comments
I think you should define ‘density’ precisely. You estimate the density of the salamander
population that is present at the surface? You don’t estimate ‘superpopulation’ size which would
also include salamanders which are underground?
Line 187. Only after initial capture or after every capture?
Reference [24] is missing (it’s the one on local extinction due to stochastic events).

This paper illustrates a small 2-year study on red-backed salamanders using spatial capture-
recapture at a few sites located on the range edge of the species. The survey design and statistical
approaches were excellent. The value of long-term and spatially replicated monitoring cannot be
emphasized enough, and hopefully SPARCnet enables this work to continue (and expand).
My only criticism is that the narrative in the discussion tends to go a bit beyond the data and
analysis provided. The paper is very well written and the material is interesting and relevant.
Having season and site specific parameters makes for difficult interpretation when the
mechanisms are not known (as the authors state on Line 249), but the general comparisons with
other published estimates are compelling. The authors should consider keeping more focus on
what was actually observed and estimated, and what it means. For example, the large
season/year differences for sigma at site 1 that were not observed for sites 2 and 3. Are there
ecological reasons site 1 would differ from sites 2 and 3? Finally, the site-year interactions and
differences should not be treated as absolute evidence of ecological variation as there is no
influence of sampling error.
Season is a confusing description here, as opposed to “session” or “year”. When discussion of
season 1 vs season 2 happens, it evokes phenological seasons when in reality the seasons are
different years of sampling. Session is a common alternative if concerns about using “year” is
that the closed sampling periods spanned multiple calendar years.
Figure 4 is portraying site-year combinations as if they are independent sites (with an arbitrary
“site” number on the x-axis). Are the NY and PA data also site-year combos? If the true
comparison is between regions, maybe a mean (+SE) density per region is necessitated. Having
all the estimates together is great but some of that variability is sampling error, not true ecological
differences.
Minor comments:
L73: It’s not clear why anthropogenic disturbances and forest fragmentation would “play a role”
4
in range edge dynamics. They make sense as referenced in L76 (“together with the combined
effect of climate change and human modifications”) as independent processes that interact with
range edge processes. But range edges can occur anywhere, independent of human influences.
Just needs some rephrasing here.
L158: “captured”
L172: Confusing to call an area measurement the buffer size. Better to list the buffer size and the
resulting state space area.
L177: Subscripted indices (and Greek letters) should be italicized (or not) to be consistent with
text. Italics are commonly used for such notation.
L178: The “e” here should probably be “exp”, unless the function is a superscript: e^dist(x,s).
L181: List the terms in the order they appear in the equation.
L183: “…sigma is equivalent to space use” is awkward and vague. Sigma is the scale parameter
of the half-normal distance function. The “implied model of space usage” is the distance function
itself, not a single parameter.
L185: Size is vague. “Area” is the intended metric.
L325: Maybe a figure of density vs. sigma would be enlightening? Hard to see how a
“significant” relationship could be illustrated with only 2 data points (conceivably site1-year1 vs.
site1-year2). I think it would be useful to include reference to Murray Efford’s recent Ecography
paper (2016) on density-dependence in home-range size, especially given the use of SCR
modeling.
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.01511
L348: “The variation of population parameters among sites and site-season interactions we report
demonstrates the dynamic properties of southern populations of red-backed salamanders.” Not
sure such inferences can be supported from 6 data points.

Comments to the Author:
Both reviewers are pretty positive about your work. One reviewer recommends some larger-
scale editorial changes, particularly a shortening of the discussion section. Both reviewers note
that you stray far from your actual findings and into the realm of speculation. I am therefore
recommending major revision - please focus the paper, particularly the discussion, on what your
data and analyses actually show. Please provide a point-by-point response showing what
changes you have made to reviewers' comments.

Comments on the introduction:

ons given why home ranges should vary spatially are convincing (there is not much on line
…). I think that home ranges should depend on resources such as food, refuges and mates.
y should it depend on the position within the species range? Is there a good theoretical
ification for this hypothesis?
<U+F0B7> We have added two citations supporting our hypothesis (Efford et al. 2016 and Muñoz et
al. 2016). Given the expected relationship between resource availability and home range
size, population density is hypothesized to have an inverse relationship with home range
size – a hypothesis that has not been widely addressed in amphibians due to the lack of
spatial capture recapture analyses. We now highlight this in Lines 96-98 of the revised
version.
e 49. I think it would be better to cite some data papers which quantify declines rather than
eral reviews. For North American amphibians, the paper by Grant et al. 2016 in Scientific
orts would be a good choice.
<U+F0B7> We have added two citations in Line 49 that address amphibian decline quantitatively
(Grant et al. 2016 and Houlahan et al. 2000).

ould also avoid ‘regulation’ on lines 237 and 251.)
<U+F0B7> We understand the reviewer’s concern and have changed the sentence In Lines 66-67 to
“Environmental conditions in these areas are characterized by warmer temperatures [17],
a factor expected to negatively affect the demography of amphibian populations.” (Lines
65-67 of revised version).
<U+F0B7> We have also replaced “regulating” in Line 235 (originally line 237) and “regulated” in
Line 248 (originally line 251) by “negatively affect”, and “impacted”, respectively.
e 67-70. The evidence listed for temperature as a factor regulating populations is very indirect.
ould cite some papers which actually show how temperature affects vital rates (e.g. Reading
7 in Oecologia; I’m sure there are similar papers for terrestrial salamanders).
<U+F0B7> We now focus the sentence in Lines 67-69 on the effects of temperature on terrestrial
salamander demography and cite Muñoz et al. (2016) which addressed survival as a
function of temperature in Plethodon cinereus, finding that warmer temperatures reduce
individual growth with negative demographic consequences as size defines survival. We
also cite Peterman and Semlitsch (2013) that addressed the decreased in recruitment (site
occupancy of juveniles) as a function of temperature in Plethodon albagula.
e 89-90. Amburgey et al. 2018 in Global Change Biology is a good paper on how position in

Comments on the discussion:
y opinion, the discussion is too long. I think it should be shortened (50% is possible, I think;

results. The result is that home ranges and densities are different from home ranges and
sities elsewhere. That’s an interesting result but a long discussion is not worthwhile if you
not explain the causes. You would need a multi-site SCR study to test which factors affect
sity and home range size.
<U+F0B7> We have shortened the discussion considering the reviewer’s suggestions. We eliminated
Lines 286-288, 289-318, 333-338, 346-348 from the original version to avoid speculation
on local adaptation.
<U+F0B7> We have also incorporated minor changes to the Abstract and Introduction sections
accordingly.
Other comments
nk you should define ‘density’ precisely. You estimate the density of the salamander
ulation that is present at the surface? You don’t estimate ‘superpopulation’ size which would
include salamanders which are underground?
<U+F0B7> Our density estimate represents the population of salamanders from a plot that come to
the surface at any point in the session. We have clarified the salamander density
represented in our method in Line 150-151.
e 187. Only after initial capture or after every capture?
<U+F0B7> It is only after the initial capture. We changed the sentence in Line 182 to “…we included
a behavioural parameter in all models that allowed capture probability to change after the
initial capture.”

e” number on the x-axis). Are the NY and PA data also site-year combos? If the true
parison is between regions, maybe a mean (+SE) density per region is necessitated. Having
he estimates together is great but some of that variability is sampling error, not true
logical differences.
<U+F0B7> The PA estimates are from one site in spring and fall of 2015, while the NY estimates are
from four site in a single year (Fall 2014). We have added this wording to the figure
legend so the reader is aware of what is being shown. This structure (4 sites, one season
in NY vs 1 site two seasons in PA) means that we are not comfortable computing post
hoc averages. Rather, we agree that being more explicit about what the estimates are, is
necessary. See lines 258-261; 580-585, and updates in Figure 4 where we have amended
the x-axis accordingly.
or comments:
: It’s not clear why anthropogenic disturbances and forest fragmentation would “play a role”
ange edge dynamics. They make sense as referenced in L76 (“together with the combined
ct of climate change and human modifications”) as independent processes that interact with
ge edge processes. But range edges can occur anywhere, independent of human
uences. Just needs some rephrasing here.
<U+F0B7> We understand the reviewer’s point. We have eliminated Lines 73-76 from original;
version.
8: “captured”
<U+F0B7> Corrected
2: Confusing to call an area measurement the buffer size. Better to list the buffer size and
resulting state space area.
<U+F0B7> Done (Line 167).
7: Subscripted indices (and Greek letters) should be italicized (or not) to be consistent with
. Italics are commonly used for such notation.
<U+F0B7> Done.
8: The “e” here should probably be “exp”, unless the function is a superscript: e^dist(x,s).
<U+F0B7> Done (Line 173).
1: List the terms in the order they appear in the equation.
<U+F0B7> Done (Line 175).
3: “…sigma is equivalent to space use” is awkward and vague. Sigma is the scale
meter of the half-normal distance function. The “implied model of space usage” is the
ance function itself, not a single parameter.
<U+F0B7> We have changed the sentence to “Given the implied model of space usage in the
detection model in which s is the scale parameter of the half-normal distance function…”
(Line 178).
5: Size is vague. “Area” is the intended metric.
<U+F0B7> We changed “size” to “area” (Line 180).
5: Maybe a figure of density vs. sigma would be enlightening? Hard to see how a
nificant” relationship could be illustrated with only 2 data points (conceivably site1-year1 vs.
1-year2). I think it would be useful to include reference to Murray Efford’s recent Ecography
er (2016) on density-dependence in home-range size, especially given the use of SCR
deling. https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.01511
<U+F0B7> We understand the reviewer’s concern and we have change the sentence in Line 325 in
original version to “However, our analysis do not support this pattern, suggesting home
ranges are not necessarily limited by density in this population but further examination of
this pattern is warranted.” (Lines 285-287).
<U+F0B7> We have included Efford et al. 2016 (see comments to first reviewer)
8: “The variation of population parameters among sites and site-season interactions we
ort demonstrates the dynamic properties of southern populations of red-backed
manders.” Not sure such inferences can be supported from 6 data points.
<U+F0B7> We understand the reviewer’s concern and have eliminated such statement from the
original version.
