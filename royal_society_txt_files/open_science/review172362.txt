Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
In the paper, the authors present relations between spatial, temporal, and numerical processing.
Namely, they show that the SNARC effect is related to poorer arithmetic skill and poorer time
estimation skills.
The topic is very interesting and timely, and has a potential to make a valid contribution to the
literature. Therefore, I am positive about the ms in general. Unfortunately, several inconsistencies
or decisions made by authors regarding their methods of analysis seem rather non-typical to
SNARC studies making the study not much comparable to evidence observed up to date.
Therefore, sometimes it was hard for me to evaluate validity of outcomes and conclusions
proposed by the authors. These issues need to be addressed before I can make an informed
decision on whether I can recommend publication of this paper. I tried to list my concerns below
and be as precise and constructive as possible in suggesting improvements to the authors. If the
authors believe I am wrong in some of these points / my suggestions are not valid, I am open to
see their arguments.
Introduction:
Sometimes I could not follow logic of the Introduction. The authors first introduce the SNARC
effect, subsequently they show the spatial mapping of time intervals / durations. Then present
some patient and prism adaptation data. In following paragraph they introduce theoretical
accounts providing some arguments for common processing (ATOM and other). This is all in
principle correct, however, I could not figure out how this Introduction justifies the study. It also
does not provide overview of evidence available in this field. Namely, there is no explicit
justification for relation between ‘mathematical intelligence’, spatial processing, and the SNARC
effect. Please state it more explicitly, and provide references to work on these relation when
needed. Justify why there should / should not be such relation.
Another point is that relation postulated by the authors (regarding temporal processing, spatial
processing, and ‘mathematical intelligence’) lacks discriminant validity. Namely, it says that
more skilled / intelligent individuals are performing better in all possible task. In other words, all
measures I mentioned above refer to accuracy / optimal quality of task performance. To make
some interesting conclusions (which the authors seem to themselves pursue), one would need to
show that such relation is specific in all these domains, but does not generalize over other
domains. See also my comment below regarding the ‘nonmathematical intelligence’.
The only exception here is the SNARC effect, which is not reflected by overall performance
accuracy. In fact the lack of the SANRC can be considered as better performance.The task is to
make judgments on parity as quickly and as accurately as possible, and the spatial component is
somehow distracting. Thus, presence of the SNARC may be related to weaker inhibition
mechanisms (Hoffmann et al., 2014; Cognitive Processing for similar reasoning).
Please define ‘mathematical intelligence’ or rather skip this potentially misleading term. Is it
something, which can be considered as equivalent to arithmetic skill, or rather math expertise or
whether the authors have any other more specific constructs in their minds? Actually,
operationalization referring to ‘solving arithmetic problems under time pressure’ appears first in
the Discussion (p.6 line 54). I would recommend to skip the potentially misleading term
'mathematical intelligence' and simply use arithmetic performance.
Names ‘mathematical intelligence’ and ‘non-mathematical intelligence’ are not very widespread
3
in psychology, and specifically they are not present in the WAIS battery manual. Therefore, I am
really not sure whether it is valid to use them. If the authors do not have strong argument to
support their point I recommend not using them.
To sum up, in my view there is no clear theoretical justification for the study, and the
Introduction needs work to make it consistent and to really justify the study to the reader.
Method and Analysis
Depite sharing the data by the authors, I think it is crucial that they provide several additional
analyses.
Why the authors almost completely skip the ‘non-mathematical’ intelligence in their analysis (by
the way note that the ‘non-mathematical intelligence’ term is also confusing)? It is mentioned in
the Method section but I could only find it in description of time estimation regression (but not in
other regressions nor the bivariate correlation table).
These results should be provided, and possibly, if there were no correlations with the ‘non-
mathematical’ intelligence, it could serve as indication of differential validity. It would also be
important to mention it briefly in the Discussion.
Comments to specific tasks:
1. Time estimation
Was there any feedback provided / were there any training sessions, or the participants were
only informed what a millisecond stands for. Were they provided with some anchors? In the
discussion the authors mention some of characteristics of participants’ responses (i.e., preference
for numbers being a multiply of 100), but it is not analysed in the manuscript itself.
2. Time production
What was the step by which duration of tones changed while adjustments? Were they random or
fixed?
3. The SNARC effect:
In fact the method proposed by the authors is relatively novel and it is hardly similar to
calculations reported in references 32 and 33 (contrary to authors’ claims). Sometimes when
response to key assignment is not flipped mid-experiment, the numbers are rather collapsed into
bins 1&2, 3&4, 6&7, 8&9 (see e.g., Pfister et al., 2013 JEP: LMC) than two regression slopes being
calculated.
Please state explicitly which sign of the slope corresponds to typical left-to-right SNARC and
which to the reversed one. Normally (as in references 32 and 33) typical SNARC is indicated by
negative slopes. Please explain explicitly to avoid confusions with the existing literature.
Check whether non-zero SNARC was present at the sample level.
Furthermore, please clarify on p.5 – is it the case that you observed consistent right-to-left
mapping (small numbers associated with right hand side?). If it is the case, I would be cautious
with any conclusion about relationship between the SNARC and other constructs. It seems to me
that the most striking effect is (however do not know whether significant – see my comment
above) reversed SNARC effects in the left to right readers. I consider this point crucial here.
This effect would be fascinating itself (if it is significant) and needs to be discussed. I see some
value in the authors claim that for addressing questions about the strength of number-to-space
mapping and math skill it is not crucial to look at specific direction of the SNARC effect.
Nevertheless, I disagree that the direction of the SNARC effect does not matter and can be
ignored in the paper. The effect is robust in left-to-right readers (i.e., left/right hand advantage
for small/large numbers). Therefore, drawing conclusions based on sample in which it is
completely opposite to what has been reported in literature in past 25 years is somehow risky,
and I would not take generelizeability of such findings for granted. On top of it, the way the
4
authors quantified the SNARC effect is also not very consistent with methods widely used in the
literature, thus it needs to be double-checked.
These comments apply to most of tasks:
a. I see no clear reason for z-scoring of the raw data within experimenter. Do groups really differ
substantially depending on experimenter?
b. If yes, one might ask a question on whether it is really an effect of experimenter (one
experimenter provides more detailed information, makes participants more motivated or so). If
the authors possess a knowledge that it was the case – it needs to be reported. The other
explanation can refer to differences between subsamples tested by each experimenter (see point
below).
c. To give an exaggerated example: if one experimenter tested students, while the other one tested
less educated individuals, who were considerably older and / or less familiar with testing
situation, the difference in results might not originate from specific influence of particular
experimenter but rather from the sample characteristics. Thus, it is not very accurate (in the
context of the questions the authors wish to answer with this study) to ascribe the same
numerical value (i.e., a certain z-score) to an individual who was the fastest/most accurate
among students, and an individual who was most accurate/fastest among less educated and not
very familiarized with testing situation individuals aged > 40 if their raw scores differ
dramatically.
d. The authors should provide descriptive statistics on the performance of reported tasks to see
whether there were no strong floor or ceiling effects, and to show whether the performance
varied systematically from chance level.
e. Please provide reliabilities of measures used in the study. As reliabilities set the upped bound
of correlations that might be observed, it is crucial to show that measures used by the authors
were reliable.
Discussion:
The shape of this section in my view largely depends on results of additional analyses I
recommend above.
Minor points:
p 1 line 53 – please clarify the percentages – is it a typo that you write 65% and 25%? I guess it is
the case and percentages should rather sum up to 100%, and there was no third group
differentiated in paper by Wood et al.

Review of RSOS-172362, Kramer, et al., “The SNARC effect is associated with worse
mathematical intelligence and poorer time estimation”
A moderate sample (n=151) performed a parity task (yielding a SNARC effect), a time evaluation
task, a time production task, and measures of arithmetic and comparison skills, and a mental
rotation task. With the exception of mental rotation and SNARC, all of the measures are modestly
correlated with one another. Several multiple regressions are reported. The results were
interpreted as support for the role of an ability to manipulate numbers and objects in space in
time estimation.
While there is some value in measuring these different attributes, the relationships seem to be
relatively weak and diffuse, so it is difficult to know what these results mean for our
understanding of these abilities. The use of absolute SNARC also makes the measure difficult to
interpret since it might be viewed as inconsistent with the concept of a left-to-right mental
number line. I wonder whether absolute SNARC is picking up some other aspect of performance
in this task, such as overall variability across digits.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
In this second review I decided to opt for open review as well, which I probably should have
done before. I wish to identify myself as Krzysztof Cipora (University of Tuebingen, Germany).
To start with, in my view the Authors made very good work in correcting the ms, and it
improved a lot, and despite my initial skepticism expressed in the first review, I do see that this
work can valuably contribute to the existing literature. Nevertheless, I still have some points I
wish to draw the author’s attention to.
Typically I do not discuss the responses to the reviews but rather tend to focus on the corrected
ms. However, in this case I think there were few misunderstandings while addressing my
comments, so before I move to the corrections in the ms itself, I wish to mention few points.
If the authors justify using the term “mathematical intelligence” let it be, and let the reader decide
on validity of this term. However, I must say that I am not fully convinced by the argument that
presence of arithmetic subscale in the WAIS battery really implies using the term “mathematical
intelligence” being valid. Does it mean that we can also say of “Letter-digit coding intelligence”,
“Block design intelligence”, or “Picture completion intelligence” as these tasks are also parts of
WAIS?
In WAIS itself there is no mention on “mathematical intelligence”, but it rather treats the
arithmetic subscale as part of more general factors [i.e., working memory index in WAIS-IV, and
of course general IQ score]. Secondly, I would not say that only arithmetic score really is the main
and only predictor of math ability. Skills measured by other subscales might also be important.
Thank you for clarifying issues of the method for calculating the SNARC. This was probably kind
of confusion on my side that I misinterpreted the direction of the SNARC. As the authors
mention, when the SNARC is typically calculated positive slopes correspond to reversed effect.
However, I think that stating this explicitly by the authors will also help avoiding confusions by
the readers.
Reliability issue. I am fine with not calculating the reliabilities of the well-known tests such as
Wechsler or so. These can be simply reported. However, as I have mentioned, the reliability of
12
both measures determines the maximal correlation, which can be observed between them.
Therefore, it would be good if the authors calculated and reported reliability of the SNARC. It
was already reported in several SNARC studies (see e.g., Cipora & Nuerk, 2013 QJEP; Georges et
al., 2017 Journal of Numerical Cognition). I still believe that calculating the reliability of SNARC
(which largely depends on the task, e.g., number of repetitions per number/condition
configuration, sample characteristics etc.). Therefore, I believe that it makes sense to calculate
these estimates.
The Introduction benefited from revisions. However, in my view it would benefit even more
from some streamlining. Another point, which I believe should be addressed by the authors more
explicitly in the Introduction would be the issue of directionality of the SNARC. Namely, the
authors argue, that presence of the SNARC and its direction should be dissociated. This is also
the rationale for the use of |SNARC| measure. This is a relatively novel claim, which will
probably stimulate further discussion on that topic (personally, I am not fully convinced, but I am
really looking forward on how this discussion develops).
However, what I do recommend the Authors do, is being more explicit on that point in the
Introduction. I believe this is important theoretical point, which needs to be addressed. So far, the
Introduction is only focused on left-to-right directionality, only mentioning the existence of the
opposite mapping in a “sizeable minority” of the participants (p. 9 line 6). This argument appears
only in the Discussion section, more as a strong statement than a firmly justified view.
Minor:
Section 2.3. Sentences on the details of the time evaluation task (p 10 line 37) should probably
appear in the description of the respective task not in the general procedure section next to tasks
being named.
Section 2.4.1. The description of z scoring could possibly be moved directly to section 2.4 on data
analysis. Placing it in section 2.4.1 can be potentially confusing as it refers not only to time
estimation task.
Effect of age on the SNARC: see also similar claims in a recent paper by Ninaus et al.

Comments to the Author:
You will find that the reviewer (Dr. Krzysztof Cipora, who has kindly opted for an open review)
and myself have found that the revised draft has considerably improved from its previous
version. However, there remains a few concerns (see the attached review) based on which I
cannot recommend the publication of your manuscript in its present form. Both the reviewer and
myself feel that these remaining issues, when appropriately addressed, will increase the clarity of
your article, which will benefit the broad readership of this journal.
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
In this second review I decided to opt for open review as well, which I probably should have
done before. I wish to identify myself as Krzysztof Cipora (University of Tuebingen, Germany).
To start with, in my view the Authors made very good work in correcting the ms, and it
improved a lot, and despite my initial skepticism expressed in the first review, I do see that this
work can valuably contribute to the existing literature. Nevertheless, I still have some points I
wish to draw the author’s attention to.
Typically I do not discuss the responses to the reviews but rather tend to focus on the corrected
ms. However, in this case I think there were few misunderstandings while addressing my
comments, so before I move to the corrections in the ms itself, I wish to mention few points.
If the authors justify using the term “mathematical intelligence” let it be, and let the reader decide
on validity of this term. However, I must say that I am not fully convinced by the argument that
presence of arithmetic subscale in the WAIS battery really implies using the term “mathematical
intelligence” being valid. Does it mean that we can also say of “Letter-digit coding intelligence”,
“Block design intelligence”, or “Picture completion intelligence” as these tasks are also parts of
WAIS?
In WAIS itself there is no mention on “mathematical intelligence”, but it rather treats the
arithmetic subscale as part of more general factors [i.e., working memory index in WAIS-IV, and
of course general IQ score]. Secondly, I would not say that only arithmetic score really is the main
and only predictor of math ability. Skills measured by other subscales might also be important.
Thank you for clarifying issues of the method for calculating the SNARC. This was probably kind
of confusion on my side that I misinterpreted the direction of the SNARC. As the authors
mention, when the SNARC is typically calculated positive slopes correspond to reversed effect.
However, I think that stating this explicitly by the authors will also help avoiding confusions by
the readers.
Reliability issue. I am fine with not calculating the reliabilities of the well-known tests such as
Wechsler or so. These can be simply reported. However, as I have mentioned, the reliability of
16
both measures determines the maximal correlation, which can be observed between them.
Therefore, it would be good if the authors calculated and reported reliability of the SNARC. It
was already reported in several SNARC studies (see e.g., Cipora & Nuerk, 2013 QJEP; Georges et
al., 2017 Journal of Numerical Cognition). I still believe that calculating the reliability of SNARC
(which largely depends on the task, e.g., number of repetitions per number/condition
configuration, sample characteristics etc.). Therefore, I believe that it makes sense to calculate
these estimates.
The Introduction benefited from revisions. However, in my view it would benefit even more
from some streamlining. Another point, which I believe should be addressed by the authors more
explicitly in the Introduction would be the issue of directionality of the SNARC. Namely, the
authors argue, that presence of the SNARC and its direction should be dissociated. This is also
the rationale for the use of |SNARC| measure. This is a relatively novel claim, which will
probably stimulate further discussion on that topic (personally, I am not fully convinced, but I am
really looking forward on how this discussion develops).
However, what I do recommend the Authors do, is being more explicit on that point in the
Introduction. I believe this is important theoretical point, which needs to be addressed. So far, the
Introduction is only focused on left-to-right directionality, only mentioning the existence of the
opposite mapping in a “sizeable minority” of the participants (p. 9 line 6). This argument appears
only in the Discussion section, more as a strong statement than a firmly justified view.
Minor:
Section 2.3. Sentences on the details of the time evaluation task (p 10 line 37) should probably
appear in the description of the respective task not in the general procedure section next to tasks
being named.
Section 2.4.1. The description of z scoring could possibly be moved directly to section 2.4 on data
analysis. Placing it in section 2.4.1 can be potentially confusing as it refers not only to time
estimation task.
Effect of age on the SNARC: see also similar claims in a recent paper by Ninaus et al.

Appendix A
Response to Reviewers
REVIEWER 1
Comment 1:
Introduction: Sometimes I could not follow logic of the Introduction.
The authors first introduce the SNARC effect, subsequently they show
the spatial mapping of time intervals / durations. Then present some
patient and prism adaptation data. In following paragraph they
introduce theoretical accounts providing some arguments for common
processing (ATOM and other). This is all in principle correct,
however, I could not figure out how this Introduction justifies the
study. It also does not provide overview of evidence available in this
field. Namely, there is no explicit justification for relation between
‘mathematical intelligence’, spatial processing, and the SNARC effect.
Please state it more explicitly, and provide references to work on these
relation when needed. Justify why there should / should not be such
relation.
Response 1:
We have reorganized and adjusted the Introduction to render its logic
more explicit. First, we now define the concepts of mathematical
intelligence and non-mathematical, conceptual intelligence in the
opening paragraph already. (Please see Response 3 for why we would
prefer to keep the term “mathematical intelligence”.) In this paragraph,
we also link more clearly our current study to the one that motivated it
(Kramer, Bressan & Grassi 2011): the hypothesis we advanced in our
2011 paper was that the association between mathematical intelligence
and time estimation is due to a common reliance on spatial
representations. In the following paragraphs of the Introduction, we
concisely describe the most iconic evidence for the interrelationship
between number, time, and space processing—and show that
behavioral and neuropsychological findings converge in this respect.
For additional evidence, we refer to two extensive reviews. We believe
that the rationale for testing the relationship between time estimation,
mathematical skills, spatial skills (mental rotation), and spatial-
numerical interactions (the SNARC effect) is now much more explicit
than it was in the previous version of the manuscript.
Comment 2:
Another point is that relation postulated by the authors (regarding
temporal processing, spatial processing, and ‘mathematical
intelligence’) lacks discriminant validity. Namely, it says that more
skilled / intelligent individuals are performing better in all possible
task. In other words, all measures I mentioned above refer to accuracy
/ optimal quality of task performance. To make some interesting
conclusions (which the authors seem to themselves pursue), one would
need to show that such relation is specific in all these domains, but
does not generalize over other domains. See also my comment below
regarding the ‘nonmathematical intelligence’.
The only exception here is the SNARC effect, which is not reflected by
overall performance accuracy. In fact the lack of the SANRC can be
considered as better performance.The task is to make judgments on
parity as quickly and as accurately as possible, and the spatial
component is somehow distracting. Thus, presence of the SNARC may
be related to weaker inhibition mechanisms (Hoffmann et al., 2014;
Cognitive Processing for similar reasoning).
Response 2:
We agree with your argument. Our data, however, suggest that it is not
the case that more intelligent people performed better in all our tasks.
We now point this out more clearly in both the Results and Discussion
sections of the paper. In the latter, we have added the following
paragraph:
“Despite correlating significantly with the |SNARC| effect on its own,
conceptual intelligence was an only marginally significant predictor of
it in our multiple regressions. Our results are thus inconclusive about
this association. On the other hand, mathematical intelligence and time
estimation predicted the |SNARC| effect both on their own and in
multiple regressions—and neither variable was at all related to
conceptual intelligence. These results, taken together, exclude that the
associations we found are simply due to a better performance of more
intelligent people across tasks.”
Comment 3:
Please define ‘mathematical intelligence’ or rather skip this
potentially misleading term. Is it something, which can be considered
as equivalent to arithmetic skill, or rather math expertise or whether
the authors have any other more specific constructs in their minds?
Actually, operationalization referring to ‘solving arithmetic problems
under time pressure’ appears first in the Discussion (p.6 line 54). I
would recommend to skip the potentially misleading term
'mathematical intelligence' and simply use arithmetic performance.
Names ‘mathematical intelligence’ and ‘non-mathematical
intelligence’ are not very widespread in psychology, and specifically
they are not present in the WAIS battery manual. Therefore, I am
really not sure whether it is valid to use them. If the authors do not
have strong argument to support their point I recommend not using
them.
Response 3:
If you feel strongly that the term “mathematical intelligence” is
misleading, we are definitely prepared to replace it throughout the
paper. However, because we measured this variable with the
arithmetic subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, we do not
quite understand in what way the term can be considered misleading. It
is important to us that we keep the same term we used in our previous
work, whose title was “Time Estimation Predicts Mathematical
Intelligence”, given that our current work builds on that one; if we
drop the previous term and use another, readers will mistakenly
assume we are now using a measure different from before. However,
following your suggestion, we are now defining what we mean by
“mathematical intelligence” and “non-mathematical intelligence” right
at the beginning of the Introduction. In addition, at various junctures in
the paper, we remind the reader that “non-mathematical intelligence”
equals conceptual intelligence.
Comment 4:
To sum up, in my view there is no clear theoretical justification for the
study, and the Introduction needs work to make it consistent and to
really justify the study to the reader.
Response 4:
Please see Response 1.
Comment 5:
Method and Analysis
Depite sharing the data by the authors, I think it is crucial that they
provide several additional analyses.
Why the authors almost completely skip the ‘non-mathematical’
intelligence in their analysis (by the way note that the ‘non-
mathematical intelligence’ term is also confusing)? It is mentioned in
the Method section but I could only find it in description of time
estimation regression (but not in other regressions nor the bivariate
correlation table).
These results should be provided, and possibly, if there were no
correlations with the ‘non-mathematical’ intelligence, it could serve as
indication of differential validity. It would also be important to
mention it briefly in the Discussion.
Response 5:
We now report in each subsection of the Results section what we
found with regard to non-mathematical (conceptual) intelligence and
discuss these results in a new paragraph in the Discussion. In addition,
we have included conceptual intelligence both in Table 1, which
presents descriptive statistics, and in Table 2, which presents the
bivariate correlations matrix.
Comment 6:
Comments to specific tasks:
Time estimation
Was there any feedback provided / were there any training sessions, or
the participants were only informed what a millisecond stands for.
Were they provided with some anchors? In the discussion the authors
mention some of characteristics of participants’ responses (i.e.,
preference for numbers being a multiply of 100), but it is not analysed
in the manuscript itself.
Response 6:
Like in our previous work, participants were not provided with
feedback, training sessions, or anchors. We have now added this
information to the Procedure section. With regard to the preference for
multiples of 100 ms, we have expanded the relevant paragraph in the
Discussion as follows: “Our time production results were stronger than
our time evaluation ones. A possible reason for this discrepancy might
be that participants’ time evaluations, unlike productions, tended
overwhelmingly to be multiples of 100 ms—which diluted between-
subject differences and made the evaluation task less discriminative.
Indeed, of a total of 3596 time evaluations, 93% were multiples of 100
ms, whereas of a total of 3019 time productions, only 5% were.”
Comment 7:
Time production
What was the step by which duration of tones changed while
adjustments? Were they random or fixed?
Response 7:
The size of adjustments was entirely under the participants’ control.
To clarify the issue, we have added a sentence to the “Time
production” section of the Methods.
This is how the relevant passage reads now (here we indicate the new
sentence in italics):
“Participants clicked on either the upper or lower half of the screen to
increase or decrease, respectively, the tone’s duration. The further
above or below the screen’s centre participants clicked, the greater
the tone duration’s adjustment. After each click, the tone was
presented with its new duration and participants could click again to
make a further adjustment or, if satisfied, click on the extreme right of
the screen to save the trial and move on to the next one.”
Comment 8:
The SNARC effect:
In fact the method proposed by the authors is relatively novel and it is
hardly similar to calculations reported in references 32 and 33
(contrary to authors’ claims). Sometimes when response to key
assignment is not flipped mid-experiment, the numbers are rather
collapsed into bins 1&2, 3&4, 6&7, 8&9 (see e.g., Pfister et al., 2013
JEP: LMC) than two regression slopes being calculated.
Please state explicitly which sign of the slope corresponds to typical
left-to-right SNARC and which to the reversed one. Normally (as in
references 32 and 33) typical SNARC is indicated by negative slopes.
Please explain explicitly to avoid confusions with the existing
literature.
Response 8:
Thank you for this very useful suggestion. In the “|SNARC| and
SNARC” section of the Data Analysis, we now discuss the difference
between Pfister et al.’s (2013) method and ours and what the
advantage of our method is.
Comment 9:
Check whether non-zero SNARC was present at the sample level.
Furthermore, please clarify on p.5 – is it the case that you observed
consistent right-to-left mapping (small numbers associated with right
hand side?). If it is the case, I would be cautious with any conclusion
about relationship between the SNARC and other constructs. It seems
to me that the most striking effect is (however do not know whether
significant – see my comment above) reversed SNARC effects in the
left to right readers. I consider this point crucial here.
This effect would be fascinating itself (if it is significant) and needs to
be discussed. I see some value in the authors claim that for addressing
questions about the strength of number-to-space mapping and math
skill it is not crucial to look at specific direction of the SNARC effect.
Nevertheless, I disagree that the direction of the SNARC effect does
not matter and can be ignored in the paper. The effect is robust in left-
to-right readers (i.e., left/right hand advantage for small/large
numbers). Therefore, drawing conclusions based on sample in which it
is completely opposite to what has been reported in literature in past
25 years is somehow risky, and I would not take generelizeability of
such findings for granted. On top of it, the way the authors quantified
the SNARC effect is also not very consistent with methods widely used
in the literature, thus it needs to be double-checked.
Response 9:
In a new section of the Results (“Descriptives”), we now report that,
across participants, the |SNARC| and SNARC effects were both
significantly larger than zero. Of the participants, only 15% had a
reversed SNARC effect, that is an effect consistent with a right-to-left
rather than a left-to-right mental number line. Thus, our data agree
with those reported previously in the literature that the majority of
people have a left-to-right mental number line. Note that with our
calculation method, a positive SNARC effect is consistent with a left-
to-right mental number line and a negative SNARC with a right-to-left
one. To avoid misunderstandings, we are now making this point very
clear in the paper as well.
Comment 10:
These comments apply to most of tasks:
a. I see no clear reason for z-scoring of the raw data within
experimenter. Do groups really differ substantially depending on
experimenter?
b. If yes, one might ask a question on whether it is really an effect
of experimenter (one experimenter provides more detailed
information, makes participants more motivated or so). If the authors
possess a knowledge that it was the case – it needs to be reported. The
other explanation can refer to differences between subsamples tested
by each experimenter (see point below).
c. To give an exaggerated example: if one experimenter tested
students, while the other one tested less educated individuals, who
were considerably older and / or less familiar with testing situation,
the difference in results might not originate from specific influence of
particular experimenter but rather from the sample characteristics.
Thus, it is not very accurate (in the context of the questions the authors
wish to answer with this study) to ascribe the same numerical value
(i.e., a certain z-score) to an individual who was the fastest/most
accurate among students, and an individual who was most
accurate/fastest among less educated and not very familiarized with
testing situation individuals aged > 40 if their raw scores differ
dramatically.
Response 10:
In the second paragraph of the “Time estimation” section of the Data
Analysis we now report the following:
“The study was conducted by four experimenters, each with a
different, experimenter-recruited, subset of participants and at different
points of time over a period of 5 years. Indeed, mean errors in time
production and especially evaluation turned out to differ between
experimenters, possibly due to small variations in delivering the
instructions for these tasks.1”
The superscript refers to the following footnote we have added to the
manuscript:
“There were no significant differences between the subsets of
participants in any of the other tasks (SNARC, mental rotation, WAIS-
R arithmetic, WAIS-R similarities). The problematic task was time
evaluation, where the errors of one experimenter’s participants had a
much higher mean and standard deviation than those of the others.
Using the untransformed data with the exclusion of the 24 participants
run by this experimenter (N= 126) led to the same pattern of results as
using the z-transformed data from all experimenters (N= 150). Here,
we conservatively present the latter analyses. (Note that although, for
consistency, here we employed z-transformed scores for all measures,
using z-transformed scores only for the time-tasks measures and not
for the others gave similar results.)”
Comment 11:
d. The authors should provide descriptive statistics on the
performance of reported tasks to see whether there were no strong
floor or ceiling effects, and to show whether the performance varied
systematically from chance level.
Response 11:
We have added a section “Descriptives” to the Results and now
explicitly report that the |SNARC| and SNARC effects were both
significantly larger than zero. There were no floor or ceiling effects in
any of the measures. We have added a new Table (Table 1) with
means, standard deviations, and minimum-maximum values for each
variable.
Comment 12:
e. Please provide reliabilities of measures used in the study. As
reliabilities set the upped bound of correlations that might be
observed, it is crucial to show that measures used by the authors were
reliable.
Response 12: Both the WAIS-R and the mental-rotation tests were
constructed and validated independently from us and are routinely
used by hundreds of researchers. Thus we do not think the reliabilities
of our measures are in any doubt. Whereas it is good practice to report
reliability and validity statistics for new, hitherto unpublished tests, we
do not think it is a tradition to do the same for standard tests that have
been used before in countless publications.
Comment 13:
Discussion:
The shape of this section in my view largely depends on results of
additional analyses I recommend above.
Response 13:
We have performed the additional analyses and adjusted the discussion
accordingly. Please also see Responses 2, 5, 9, and 11.
Comment 14:
Minor points:
p 1 line 53 – please clarify the percentages – is it a typo that you write
65% and 25%? I guess it is the case and percentages should rather
sum up to 100%, and there was no third group differentiated in paper
by Wood et al.
Response 14:
Thank you for spotting this. It was indeed a typo; the values should
have been 65% and 35%. Although we still point out that a minority of
people show a right-to-left SNARC effect, those exact values were
found in very small samples and may thus not be reliable; for this
reason, we no longer mention them.
Comment 15:
Reference 2 – please list all coauthors of the metaanalysis
Response 15:
Done.
REVIEWER 2
Comment 1:
While there is some value in measuring these different attributes, the
relationships seem to be relatively weak and diffuse, so it is difficult to
know what these results mean for our understanding of these abilities.
The use of absolute SNARC also makes the measure difficult to
interpret since it might be viewed as inconsistent with the concept of a
left-to-right mental number line. I wonder whether absolute SNARC is
picking up some other aspect of performance in this task, such as
overall variability across digits.
Response 1:
Our view is that the |SNARC| effect is not “inconsistent with the
concept of a left-to-right mental number line” but rather consistent
with the general concept of a mental number line—a line that may go
left-to-right in some people and right-to-left in others. That some
people in Western societies show a reversed SNARC effect, consistent
with a right-to-left rather than a left-to-right mental number line, has
been found by us but also by others; this fact cannot be ignored. We
have rewritten what is now the “SNARC and |SNARC|” section of the
Data Analysis to clarify this issue. We also add: “In regression
analyses, a negative SNARC effect is traditionally treated as the
opposite of a positive one; that is, as more different from the positive
SNARC effect than a SNARC effect of zero. We believe this is a
mistake. Unlike a SNARC effect of zero, positive and negative
SNARC effects are both consistent with the participant being
influenced, during parity judgment, by irrelevant numerical
magnitudes. If one accepts the hypothesis that numerical magnitude is
represented along a mental number line, the only difference between a
positive and a negative SNARC effect is the direction of this line.”

Response to Reviewers
REVIEWER 1
In this second review I decided to opt for open review as well, which I probably
should have done before. I wish to identify myself as Krzysztof Cipora (University of
Tuebingen, Germany). To start with, in my view the Authors made very good work in
correcting the ms, and it improved a lot, and despite my initial skepticism expressed
in the first review, I do see that this work can valuably contribute to the existing
literature. Nevertheless, I still have some points I wish to draw the author’s attention
to.
Typically I do not discuss the responses to the reviews but rather tend to focus on the
corrected ms. However, in this case I think there were few misunderstandings while
addressing my comments, so before I move to the corrections in the ms itself, I wish
to mention few points.
Comment 1:
If the authors justify using the term “mathematical intelligence” let it
be, and let the reader decide on validity of this term. However, I must
say that I am not fully convinced by the argument that presence of
arithmetic subscale in the WAIS battery really implies using the term
“mathematical intelligence” being valid. Does it mean that we can
also say of “Letter-digit coding intelligence”, “Block design
intelligence”, or “Picture completion intelligence” as these tasks are
also parts of WAIS?
In WAIS itself there is no mention on “mathematical intelligence”, but
it rather treats the arithmetic subscale as part of more general factors
[i.e., working memory index in WAIS-IV, and of course general IQ
score]. Secondly, I would not say that only arithmetic score really is
the main and only predictor of math ability. Skills measured by other
subscales might also be important.
Response 1:
Following the reviewer’s previous suggestion, we define what we
mean by both “mathematical intelligence” and “non-mathematical
intelligence” right at the beginning of the Introduction. We thank the
reviewer for not insisting that we change our terminology. Because the
current study is a continuation of our previous one entitled “Time
Estimation Predicts Mathematical Intelligence”, we feel it is best to
keep the terminology between these two papers consistent.
Comment 2:
Thank you for clarifying issues of the method for calculating the
SNARC. This was probably kind of confusion on my side that I
misinterpreted the direction of the SNARC. As the authors mention,
when the SNARC is typically calculated positive slopes correspond to
reversed effect. However, I think that stating this explicitly by the
authors will also help avoiding confusions by the readers.
Response 2:
Agreed.
Comment 3:
Reliability issue. I am fine with not calculating the reliabilities of the
well-known tests such as Wechsler or so. These can be simply
reported. However, as I have mentioned, the reliability of both
measures determines the maximal correlation, which can be observed
between them. Therefore, it would be good if the authors calculated
and reported reliability of the SNARC. It was already reported in
several SNARC studies (see e.g., Cipora & Nuerk, 2013 QJEP;
Georges et al., 2017 Journal of Numerical Cognition). I still believe
that calculating the reliability of SNARC (which largely depends on
the task, e.g., number of repetitions per number/condition
configuration, sample characteristics etc.). Therefore, I believe that it
makes sense to calculate these estimates.
Response 3:
Cipora and Nuerk (2013) found no relationship between the SNARC
effect and participants’ “level of mathematics”. Because this was a
null effect, it was crucial to be able to demonstrate that the measures
were sufficiently reliable and that a relationship could have emerged if
it had existed. Here, we find significant relationships between the
SNARC effect and both mathematical intelligence and time estimation
abilities, not null effects, and there is much less reason to doubt
sufficient reliability. Still, as requested by the reviewer, now we report
the reliabilities of our measures in footnote 2, which reads as follows:
“The odd/even trials split-half reliability of the standardised SNARC
effect (r = .64; |SNARC| effect, r = .65; Spearman-Brown corrected)
was in the same range as in previous reports (e.g., [41,42]). The
reliability of all other measures was above .80.”
Comment 4:
The Introduction benefited from revisions. However, in my view it
would benefit even more from some streamlining.
Response 4:
The fourth paragraph of the Introduction might be not as tightly related
to our argument as the others. We considered cutting it. Yet eventually
we decided against it, on the grounds that this paragraph’s discussion
of relevant neuropsychological findings complements the discussion of
relevant behavioral ones, making the introduction more informative
and helping readers understand the whole picture.
Comment 5:
Another point, which I believe should be addressed by the authors
more explicitly in the Introduction would be the issue of directionality
of the SNARC. Namely, the authors argue, that presence of the SNARC
and its direction should be dissociated. This is also the rationale for
the use of |SNARC| measure. This is a relatively novel claim, which
will probably stimulate further discussion on that topic (personally, I
am not fully convinced, but I am really looking forward on how this
discussion develops).
However, what I do recommend the Authors do, is being more explicit
on that point in the Introduction. I believe this is important theoretical
point, which needs to be addressed. So far, the Introduction is only
focused on left-to-right directionality, only mentioning the existence of
the opposite mapping in a “sizeable minority” of the participants (p. 9
line 6). This argument appears only in the Discussion section, more as
a strong statement than a firmly justified view.
Response 5:
We have followed the reviewer’s advice. While leaving the technical
definition of the |SNARC| concept and its exact calculation in the
Method section, we have now introduced the basic motivation behind
its use in the last paragraph of the Introduction.
Comment 6:
Section 2.3. Sentences on the details of the time evaluation task (p 10
line 37) should probably appear in the description of the respective
task not in the general procedure section next to tasks being named.
Response 6:
Building on the reviewer’s suggestion, we have merged the time-
evaluation and time-production subsections and placed the sentences
in question at the beginning of this joint subsection.
Comment 7:
Section 2.4.1. The description of z scoring could possibly be moved
directly to section 2.4 on data analysis. Placing it in section 2.4.1 can
be potentially confusing as it refers not only to time estimation task.
Response 7:
We have followed the reviewer’s advice and moved this paragraph to
the beginning of the Data Analysis section.

Response 8:
We thank the reviewer for bringing this work to our attention; we now
cite it in the last sentence of the Results section.
