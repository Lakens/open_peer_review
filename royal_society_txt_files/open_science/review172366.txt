This is an interesting and useful investigation of the adherence of Sf21 cells expressing the
BmOR3 receptor, on Al2O3 and Al layers. The authors have contacted calcium imaging, SEM
observations and image analysis of cross-sections of cells, attached to FET devices. Their findings
suggest that Sf21 cells are adhering more tightly only on Al2O3 and not on Al layers. They
suggest that Sf21 attachment does not rely on focal adhesions, but on other mechanisms. This
could imply that these cells are capacitively coupled to the gates of the underlying FETs.
I believe this work is advancing the field therefore, it should be published, subject to the
following revisions:
i) The central finding of this paper relies on multiple measurements of just 2 cells (referred to as
cells A and B). In order to comply with statistical standards, I suggest the authors repeat the
cross-section measurements to at least 1 more cell (cell C), provide an additional histogram and
statistical analysis of all cells in table 1 (cells A&B&C).
ii) The authors suggest that no focal adhesions exist on Sf21 (expressing BmOR3) cultured on
Al2O3 and provide a model of adhesion in figure 7. As the implications of this are important, I
encourage the authors to perform a simple immuno-staining with vinculin and provide
photomicrographs as evidence, to solidify their argument.

Suggest you do not refer to the tool used for the sample preparation as "the Cross Section
Polisher" with no other context, especially in the abstract of the paper. At the very least it should
be "a cross section polisher" and the manufacturer and the method by which it works should be
stated as early as possible. Otherwise it suggests that all readers should already be familiar with
what you are referring to. There could be more done to explain the data processing methods, and
I think perhaps you have not completely understood the open-data policy of the journal, you are
probably expect to provide access to the full data sets and the code (Matlab and ImageJ) used to
process the data. There are some further annotations and comments in the attached copy of the
paper. The results are good for use of aluminium oxide coated electrodes, but I'm fairly sure that
this material (sapphire) has long been considered as biocompatible. It is more interesting that
you could not see problems with viability of the insect cells on aluminium with presumably just a
native oxide. Possibly the material is more stable at the pH used for the insect cell culture?

30 Abstract
31
32 Field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensors have a wide range of applications, and a bio-FET
33
odorant sensor based on insect (Sf21) cells expressing insect odorant receptors (ORs) with
34
35 sensitivity and selectivity has emerged. To fully realize the practical application of bio-FET
36
odorant sensors, knowledge of the cell–device interface for efficient signal transfer, and a
37
38 reliable and low-cost measurement system using the commercial complementary metal-oxide-
39
semiconductor (CMOS) foundry process, will be indispensable. However, the interfaces
40
41 between Sf21 cells and sensor devices are largely unknown, and electrode materials used in the
42
commercial CMOS foundry process are generally limited to aluminium, which is reportedly
43
44 toxic to cells. In this study, we investigated Sf21 cell–device interfaces by scanning electron
45
microscopy after developing specimens using the Cross Section Polisher to preserve their
46
47 nanostructures. Calcium imaging of Sf21 cells expressing insect ORs was used to verify the
48
functions of Sf21 cells as odorant sensor elements on the electrode materials. We found that the
49
50 cell–device interface was ~10 nm wide on average, suggesting that the adhesion mechanism of
51
Sf21 cells may differ from that of other cells. These results will help to construct accurate signal
52
53 detection from expressed insect ORs using FETs.

Field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensors, in which biological cells or receptors are
9
10
11
immobilized onto the electrodes, have attractive characteristics such as non-invasive
12
13
14
measurement, long-term recording, and high sensitivity and selectivity for
15
16
17
environmental monitoring, drug screening, and point-of-care testing1. Recently, odorant
18
19
20
biosensing techniques based on mammalian or insect odorant receptors (ORs) have
21
22
23
emerged2. We proposed a new bio-hybrid electronic odorant sensor, termed the odor-
24
25
26
sensitive field-effect transistor (OSFET)3, based on extended-gate FETs with thin Al2O3
27
28
29
layers and Sf21 insect cells derived from pupal ovarian tissues of Spodoptera
30
31
32
frugiperda4 expressing insect ORs. Sf21 cells with insect ORs act as odorant sensor
33
34
35
elements5, 6; simply attaching them to extended-gate electrodes allowed the sensors to
36
37
38
discriminate between two structurally similar odorants by electrical signals.
39
40
41
To fully realize the practical uses of OSFETs, it is essential to efficiently detect
42
43
44
signals from Sf21 cells expressing insect ORs and to develop a reliable and low-cost
45
46
47
measurement system. The signal detection of OSFETs is affected by the adhesive
48
49
50
interfaces, which are called clefts, between Sf21 cells expressing insect ORs and the
51
52
53
extended-gate electrode surfaces. These clefts disperse the ionic current generated by the
54
55
56
cells and thereby cause degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio7. Although various cell–
57
58
59
device interfaces, such as those of HEK293 cells and some types of neurons, were

4 previously observed by optical methods or electron microscopy 8, 9, this knowledge
5
6
7 cannot directly be applied to Sf21 cells because of the differences in cell types and
8
9
10 shapes. To our knowledge, the adhesive interfaces between Sf21 cells and planar metal
11
12
13 or oxide substrates have not been evaluated.
14
15
16 Applying commercial complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) foundry
17
18
19 processes provided us with reliable electron devices using proven fabrication
20
21
22 procedures10 and led to repeatable measurement results using OSFETs 3. Thus, CMOS
23
24
25 foundry processes have high yields and help to develop cost-effective bio-FET odorant
26
27
28 sensors. However, electrode materials in these processes are generally limited to
29
30
31 aluminium11, for which neuro-toxicity has been reported11–13, and thus, requires costly
32
33
34 biocompatible coatings. Therefore, we investigated the compatibility of Sf21 cells with
35
36
37 the materials of CMOS devices, in particular, aluminium and Al2O3 layers.
38
39
40 In the present study, we observed and analysed the adhesive interfaces between Sf21
41
42
43 cells expressing insect ORs and aluminium-based layers, including aluminium and
44
45
46 Al2O3. We developed cross-sectional specimens of Sf21 cells using the Cross Section
47
48
49 Polisher, because this method allowed us to develop high-quality cross-sections of soft-
50
51
52 hard composite specimens with minimal invasion of the specimen structures. Various
53
54
55 types of cells are known to form focal adhesions when connecting to substrates 14. Focal
56
57
58 adhesions are characterized by distances of 10–20 nm between the plasma membranes

4 and substrates15, and in the case of HEK293 cells, 5–20% of adhesive interfaces are
5
6
7 estimated to be focal adhesions9. In contrast, our direct observations by scanning electron
8
9
10 microscopy (SEM) of the adhesive interfaces suggested that Sf21 cells expressing insect
11
12
13 ORs had much closer contact sites than other cells. Cleft states are also strongly related
14
15
16 to the electrical models of signal detections, and their distances should ideally be as short
17
18
19 as possible for better electrical coupling16. Detailed evaluation of the cell–device
20
21
22 interfaces in this study will support construction of the electrical model of OSFETs for
23
24
25 high-fidelity data acquisition. To verify the functions of Sf21 cells as odorant sensor
26
27
28 elements on electrode materials used in commercial CMOS foundry processes, we
29
30
31 conducted calcium imaging of Sf21 cells expressing insect ORs on four types of
32
33
34 substrates. Additionally, we compared Sf21 and HEK293T cell growth on aluminium
35
36
37 layers to understand the effects of aluminium on these cells.

37
38
39 Specimens were prepared stepwise for bird’s-eye SEM observations as follows. (1)
40
41

Calcium imaging of BmOR3 cells and cell adhesion on aluminium-based materials
9
10
11
Cell-activity measurements using aluminium-based electrodes help us to develop low-
12
13
14
cost biosensor systems based on the commercial CMOS foundry process by eliminating
15
16
17
the need for biocompatible coatings. In OSFETs, Sf21 cells expressing insect ORs, such
18
19
20
as BmOR3 cells, should function as odorant sensor elements on aluminium-based
21
22
23
electrodes. To verify the viability of BmOR3 cells, we conducted calcium imaging of
24
25
26
the cells on four types of substrates. The dose-response of BmOR3 cells toward
27
28
29
bombykal doses ranging from 1 µM to 10 µM on each type of substrate was compared.
30
31
32
Typical dose-response profiles of BmOR3 cells are shown in Figure 2 (a). Pseudo-colour
33
34
35
heat maps before and after 10-µM bombykal stimulation are shown in Figure 2 (b). We
36
37
38
were concerned that the toxicity of aluminium-based materials would cause abnormal
39
40
41
fluorescence intensity changes in the BmOR3 cells; however, these experiments
42
43
44
indicated that the dose-dependent responses of BmOR3 cells were consisted with those
45
46
47
in previous studies, and the cells exhibited fluorescence intensity changes of more than
48
49
50
5% in entire images. We then compared the fluorescence intensity changes of BmOR3
51
52
53
cells on aluminium-based materials with those on the silicon substrates and cover glasses.
54
55
56
The fluorescence intensity changes on aluminium-sputtered substrates were nearly the
57
58
59
same as those on Al2O3-sputtered layers (Figure 3 (a)). To eliminate an effect of substrate

3
4 thickness, we measured the fluorescence intensity changes of BmOR3 cells on bare
5
6
7 silicon substrate, because the cells were seeded directly on 12-mm cover glasses in
8
9
10 previous experiments (Figure 3 (b)). Fluorescence intensity changes on 12-mm cover
11
12
13 glasses were measured as the control (Figure 3 (c)). We confirmed that the cells on
14
15
16 aluminium-sputtered silicon substrate exhibited fluorescence intensities similar to or
17
18
19 higher than those on bare silicon substrate and cover glasses. Al2O3 has previously been
20
21
22 used in OSFET as an electrode coating, and thus, understanding the cellular state
23
24
25 differences between the coatings will provide alternative electrode material options. The
26
27
28 fluorescence intensities of BmOR3 cells on Al2O3-sputtered silicon substrate were
29
30
31 similar to or higher than those on bare silicon substrate and cover glasses (Figure 3 (d),
32
33
34 (e)). Next, the cell-response rates of BmOR3 cells on aluminium-based materials were
35
36
37 compared with those on other substrates. Over 80% of BmOR3 cells on the aluminium-
38
39
40 sputtered silicon substrate exhibited a larger than 5% increase in fluorescence intensity
41
42
43 when stimulated with 10 µM bombykal, and the response rates were nearly the same as
44
45
46 those on other substrates (Figure 3 (f)). The response rates of cells on Al2O3-sputtered
47
48
49 silicon substrate were also nearly the same as those on bare silicon and cover glasses.
50
51
52 Additionally, we evaluated cell growth of Sf21 and HEK293T cells on aluminium-
53
54
55 sputtered substrate to evaluate any toxic effects of the aluminium. Sf21 and HEK293T
56
57
58 cells were seeded on aluminium-sputtered substrate and on plastic cell-culture dishes as

8
9
10 were not uniform, and cell growth was slower than that on plastic dishes (See Figures

21
22 We investigated the cellular state and shape on aluminium-based extended-gate electrode
23
24
25 surfaces to determine the viability of Sf21 cells on aluminium-based materials, which are
26
27
28 thought to have toxic effects. BmOR3 cells on Al2O3-sputtered and aluminium extended-
29
30
31 gate electrodes are shown in Figure 4 (a) and (b), respectively. The top-side SEM image
32
33
34 of the aluminium extended-gate electrode with BmOR3 cells is shown in Figure 4 (c).
35
36
37 The SEM images revealed that BmOR3 cells were tightly attached on both types of
38
39
40 layers, and that the cells on the aluminium extended-gate electrodes did not flee to the
41
42
43 SiO2-insulator areas.
44
45
46 We then investigated shrinking or expansion of living Sf21 cells on aluminium-
47
48
49 sputtered silicon substrate and plastic dishes. Measurements made with ImageJ
50
51
52 suggested that there were no significant differences in diameter between the 164 cells on
53
54
55 the aluminium layer and the 190 cells on the plastic dish (Figure 4 (d)).

4 To observe and analyse the cleft distances between BmOR3 cells and Al 2O3 layers, we
5
6
7 developed cross-sectional specimens using the CP. Previously, a microtome method or a
8
9
10 focused ion beam was used for specimen preparations of cell–device interfaces9, 16, 24;
11
12
13 however, the tip of a microtome can easily snap off when cutting a device chip, and the
14
15
16 width of a cross-sectional area of a focused ion beam is limited to several tens of square
17
18
19 micrometers25. Therefore, the CP, which mainly consists of a specimen, a shielding plate,
20
21
22 an ion gun, and a broad argon ion beam, was chosen to prepare high-quality cross-
23
24
25 sectional specimens for SEM with broad observation areas25. The cross-sections were
26
27
28 observed by SEM (JSM-7800F; JEOL) at a 5-kV accelerating voltage (spatial resolution:
29
30
31 15 kV: 0.8 nm; 1 kV: 1.2 nm).
32
33
34 The cross-section images allowed observing the intracellular structures of BmOR3
35
36
37 cells on Al2O3-sputtered substrates (Figure 5 (a)). We then observed the BmOR3 cells
38
39
40 on OSFET electrodes. Owing to the broad processing range of the CP, we were able to
41
42
43 develop specimens to examine the interface between two BmOR3 cells (Cell A and B in
44
45
46 the following) on one OSFET electrode with an Al2O3 layer. An overall cross-sectional
47
48
49 image of a BmOR3 cell attached to an Al2O3 layer for cleft analysis is shown in Figure
50
51
52 5 (b), a magnified view of the attachment interface of the same cell is shown in Figure 5
53
54
55 (c). We found that the specimen preparation process using the CP preserved the plasma
56
57
58 membranes of the BmOR3 cells, the planar Al2O3 layer, and their interface.

7 values of sharp brightness value decreases were calculated from the plot profile. An
8
9
10 example of a FWHM value and a plot profile are shown in Figure 6 (a). The profile line

12
13 was set to 1 pixel (= 1.86 nm). Figure 6 (b) and (c) show histograms of cleft distance
14
15
16 distributions of Cell A and B on the same Al2O3 layer. One hundred points of Cell A and
17
18
19 87 points of Cell B were analysed. For example, the histogram of Cell A indicated that
20
21
22 32.0% of cleft distances were 5 nm or less, and 53.0% were 10 nm or less. The average
23
24
25 cleft distance between Cell A and the Al2O3 layer was 6.2 ± 0.4 nm (Table 1). In the case
26
27
28 of Cell B, 57.4% of cleft distances were no greater than 15 nm, and there were no cleft
29
30
31 distances greater than 35 nm. The average cleft distance of the two cells was 10.3 ± 0.5

Adhesive interfaces between BmOR3 cells and aluminium-based materials
9
10
11
HEK293 cell–device and neural cell–device interfaces have been previously
12
13
14
characterized by various techniques such as fluorescence interference-contrast
15
16
17
microscopy, which has a high resolution of vertical distances 8, 26, 27, or transmission
18
19
20
electron microscopy (TEM)7, 9, 16, and the reported cleft widths fell within the range of
21
22
23
10–100 nm. This study investigated the adhesive interfaces between BmOR3 cells and
24
25
26
Al2O3 layers with specimen preparation using the CP. The major finding of cross-
27
28
29
sectional observations and image analysis in this study is that, beyond our initial
30
31
32
expectations, the average cleft distances between BmOR3 cells and Al 2O3 layers
33
34
35
measured as FWHM values were shorter than those previously measured by using
36
37
38
fluorescence interference-contrast or TEM.
39
40
41
Various types of cells, including fibroblasts, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and
42
43
44
platelets, are known to form focal adhesions when they attach to substrates 14. In previous
45
46
47
observations, focal adhesions between plasma membranes and substrates were typically
48
49
50
10–20 nm15, and 5–20% of the close adhesion points (cleft distances no greater than 10
51
52
53
nm) of HEK293 cells on substrates were thought to be focal adhesion points 9. In contrast,
54
55
56
our analysis demonstrated that 85.0% of cleft distances of Cell A fell within the range of
57
58
59
0–10 nm. The cleft distances of Cell B were wider than those of Cell A; however, the
60
16
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 17 of 38 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3
4 majority were still under 15 nm. These results indicated that the large areas of the bottom
5
6
7 surfaces of BmOR3 cells were attached to electrode surfaces tightly. The average cleft
8
9
10 distance of the two BmOR3 cells (187 analysed points) on the same Al2O3 layer was
11
12
13 approximately 10 nm. Figure 7 (a) shows a schematic of a previously reported cell
14
15
16 adhesion with the formation of focal adhesions on a planar electrode, and (b) shows a
17
18
19 schematic of cell adhesion of an Sf21 cell on a planar electrode based on observations
20
21
22 from and analysis of this study. This result demonstrated that the cleft distances of Sf21
23
24
25 cells expressing insect ORs were obviously shorter than previous results predicted, and
26
27
28 that the adhesion state could be different from that of other types of cells. The close
29
30
31 adhesion points that were assumed to be focal adhesions in HEK293 cells 9 were not
32
33
34 observed in Sf21 cells under the experimental conditions of this study. To improve cell
35
36
37 adhesion and electrical coupling between neurons and sensing-device surfaces, spine-
38
39
40 shaped gold microstructures protruding from flat substrates were developed 7. In contrast,
41
42
43 our results suggested that Sf21 cells expressing insect ORs could be tightly attached to
44
45
46 the planar device surfaces without structural improvements. In Figure 5 (c), there were
47
48
49 black areas above the plasma membranes of BmOR3 cells. These areas might have been
50
51
52 caused by specimen preparation; however, the plasma membrane was clearly preserved
53
54
55 and attached to the Al2O3 layer. Therefore, we concluded that these areas had no effect
56
57
58 on cleft distance observations. We tried to observe and measure BmOR3 cells on

11
12 Electrical model of OSFET
13
14
15 The observed adhesion state of BmOR3 cells suggests that the electrical model of the
16
17
18 OSFET is different from previously proposed FETs. In this study, the average cleft
19
20
21 distance of BmOR3 cells was approximately 10 nm. Previous electrical models of cell–
22
23
24 device interfaces were thought to accurately describe the cleft between cells and silicon
25
26
27 chips because of their certain degree of cleft distance 28-30. The cleft filled with ionic
28
29
30 solution generates resistance, termed ‘seal resistance’. The voltage formed over the
31
32
33 resistance modulates the FET gate voltage30.
34
35
36 In contrast, our SEM study suggests that the electrical model of the OSFET might
37
38
39 be driven by capacitive coupling. The OSFET utilizes Sf21 cells expressing insect ORs
40
41
42 along with OR co-receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels, causing inward non-
43
44
45 selective cation influx (including Na+ and Ca2+) when bound to specific odorant

48 molecules31. This leads to increased intracellular electrical charges when the insect ORs
49
50
51 respond to specific odorants, and it may directly modulate the drain current of FETs. We
52
53
54 previously detected increases in drain current of the OSFET when Sf21 cells expressing
55
56
57 insect ORs responded to specific odorants3. According to this model, tightly coupled
58

18
19 Knowledge of the cellular state of Sf21 cells on aluminium-based materials could benefit
20
21
22 the development of simple cost-effective bio-hybrid electronic odorant sensor systems.
23
24
25 We generally sputtered Al2O3 layers onto extended-gate electrodes of the OSFET for
26
27
28 stable surface potentials. Calcium imaging of BmOR3 cells indicated that the cells on
29
30
31 aluminium-sputtered silicon substrate exhibited fluorescence intensity changes
32
33
34 equivalent to those on Al2O3-sputtered silicon substrate, bare silicon substrate, and 12-
35
36
37 mm diameter cover glasses without affecting their sensitivity, cell-response rate, or dose-
38
39
40 response profile. In the case of 1-µM bombykal stimulation, the fluorescence intensity
41
42
43 changes of BmOR3 cells on aluminium-sputtered substrate were larger than those on 12-
44
45
46 mm diameter cover glasses (Al; 28.8 ± 1.3%, Glass; 22.0 ± 1.0%, p = 0.015). In some
47
48
49 cases, the fluorescence intensity changes of BmOR3 cells on Al 2O3-sputtered substrate
50
51
52 were higher than those on bare silicon substrate (Al2O3; 32.4 ± 1.7%, Si; 21.3 ± 2.9%, p
53
54
55 = 0.046) and 12-mm diameter cover glasses (Al2O3; 32.4 ± 1.7%, Glass; 22.0 ± 1.0%, p
56
57
58 = 0.013). The high reflectance of aluminium or Al2O3 surfaces may increase, but in any

3
4 case did not decrease, the intensity changes. The cell shapes on aluminium-based
5
6
7 extended-gate electrodes did not change. Cell diameter comparisons indicated that there
8
9
10 was no irregular expansion, shrinking, or collapse (an Sf9 cell is typically ~15 µm in
11
12
13 diameter32). Cell growth and cell area comparisons between Sf21 and HEK293T cells
14
15
16 on aluminium substrate also supported the conclusion that Sf21 cells are viable on
17
18
19 aluminium-based materials. In contrast, HEK293T cell growth on aluminium was
20
21
22 distinctly different from that on plastic dishes, suggesting that these cells are not suitable
23
24
25 for use on aluminium electrodes. Sf21 and HEK293T cells are generally cultured at
26
27
28 different pH (Sf21 cells; pH 7.8, HEK293T cells; pH 6.4); however, this study did not
29
30
31 take into account the influence of pH of the cell culture medium.
32
33
34 The experimental results indicated that Sf21 cells expressing insect ORs exhibited
35
36
37 aluminium tolerance, despite the concern regarding toxicity11-13. This unique
38
39
40 characteristic of Sf21 cells suggests that the commercial CMOS foundry process can be
41
42
43 directly applied to Sf21 cells without inducing damage, thereby demonstrating its
44
45
46 potential to reduce post-processing costs, including expenses for biocompatible coatings.

4 Conclusions
5
6
7
8
In this study, we investigated the interface between Sf21 cells expressing insect ORs and
9
10
11
aluminium-based layers. Specimen preparation using the CP for SEM observations
12
13
14
allowed us to analyse the detailed nanostructures of the Sf21 cell–device interfaces, and
15
16
17
image analysis of cleft distances indicated that the majority of the bottom surfaces of
18
19
20
Sf21 cells expressing insect ORs attached to device surfaces at distances shorter than
21
22
23
those previously reported. These results suggested that the cells attached to the device
24
25
26
surface by a different mechanism than focal adhesion. Additionally, this study provided
27
28
29
the information to support that the electrical model of the OSFET could be the capacitive
30
31
32
coupling of the plasma membranes of Sf21 cells expressing insect ORs and device
33
34
35
surfaces, and is unrelated to ionic current in the cleft of cell–device interfaces. The
36
37
38
results of calcium imaging and cell-growth observations led us to expect that Sf21 cells
39
40
41
expressing insect ORs could function as odorant sensor elements on aluminium-based
42
43
44
layers without being damaged, and that OSFETs can utilize aluminium-based electrode
45
46
47
materials for reliable and cost-effective odorant sensor systems based on the commercial
48
49
50
CMOS foundry process.

Appendix B
Response letter
Professor R. Kerry Rowe
Professor Richard Benton
Royal Society Open Science
Dear Professors Rowe and Benton
Subject: Submission of revised paper ID RSOS-172366 titled "Increasing cell-device adherence
using cultured insect cells for receptor-based biosensors”.
We thank the referees for careful reading our manuscript and for giving useful comments. In
response to the referees' comments, we have revised the manuscript. We look forward to
publication of our manuscript in Royal Society Open Science. Our responses to the referee's
comments are as follows.
Response to the first referee’s comments
Comment 1: The central finding of this paper relies on multiple measurements of just 2 cells
(referred to as cells A and B). In order to comply with statistical standards, I suggest the authors
repeat the cross-section measurements to at least 1 more cell (cell C), provide an additional
histogram and statistical analysis of all cells in table 1 (cells A&B&C).
Response:
Thank you for your suggestion. We understand that the number of cells tightly attached on Al2O3
layers is important for statistical analysis, and to avoid arbitrary selection. We have added the
cross-sectional analysis of multiple cells in Figure S5 (a) of the revised manuscript, which
suggests that we have eliminated the arbitrariness of cell choice.
We had nine cross-sectional images of BmOR3 cells, out of which seven were tightly attached
on Al2O3 layers (Figure S5 (b)-(j) in the revised manuscript). Then, we selected two cells to
conduct elaborate analysis of their adhesive interface. This indicated that a majority of the cells
were tightly attached onto Al2O3 layers. We have added the description regarding this in the main
text of the revised manuscript (pp 14-15 in red letters).
Comment 2: The authors suggest that no focal adhesions exist on Sf21 (expressing BmOR3)
cultured on Al2O3 and provide a model of adhesion in figure 7. As the implications of this are
1
important, I encourage the authors to perform a simple immuno-staining with vinculin and
provide photomicrographs as evidence, to solidify their argument.
Response:
Thank you for providing these insights. We understand that membrane structures are important
for analyzing focal adhesion. As mentioned above, we did not observe focal adhesion in majority
of the cells. These data indicated that almost all Sf21 cells expressing BmOR3 in this study did
not have focal adhesion without immuno-staining of vinculin. In addition, most of the cells were
tightly attached onto Al2O3 layers (Figure S5 of the revised manuscript).
To confirm that the membrane of the BmOR3 cell was attached to the Al2O3 layer, we analyzed
brightness value of free and attached membrane of the BmOR3 cell (Cell A). Results showed that
the floating parts of the cell had long cleft distances and attached parts of the cell had short cleft
distances (Figure S6 of the revised manuscript). We clearly distinguished the free or attached
membrane and the Al2O3 layer using profile lines, and the membrane was certainly attached on
the device surface. We added the description regarding this in the main text of the revised
manuscript (p 15 in red letters).
As future work, we would like to conduct immuno-staining of Sf21 cells expressing BmOR3
with vinculin to confirm whether these cells have a focal adhesion mediated mechanism.
Response to the second referee’s comments
Comment 1: Suggest you do not refer to the tool used for the sample preparation as "the Cross
Section Polisher" with no other context, especially in the abstract of the paper. At the very least it
should be "a cross section polisher" and the manufacturer and the method by which it works
should be stated as early as possible. Otherwise it suggests that all readers should already be
familiar with what you are referring to.
Response: Thank you for the suggestion. We removed the phrase "the Cross Section Polisher"
from the abstract and the modified the sentence as shown in red letters in the revised abstract.
Comment 2: There could be more done to explain the data processing methods, and I think
perhaps you have not completely understood the open-data policy of the journal, you are probably
expect to provide access to the full data sets and the code (Matlab and ImageJ) used to process
the data.
Response: Thank you for the suggestions. To allow other researchers to reproduce or refer to our
analysis, we added details of the measured points of an attached BmOR3 cell in Figure S1 and
the description in the main text (p 10 in red letters) of the revised manuscript. We referred ImageJ
forum (http://forum.imagej.net/) to write the macro program. The code has already been posted
2
in the forum page, therefore we have not shown it in the manuscript. We have only modified the
pixel distance from 50 to 10. We added the description regarding this in the main text (p 10 in red
letters) of the revised manuscript.
Comment 3: There are some further annotations and comments in the attached copy of the paper.
Comment in the copy:
<U+F09E> This sentence probably should not be in an abstract. Especially the mention of “THE Cross
Section Polisher” as if it was something the reader already know about.
<U+F09E> What is a “cross section polisher”? It’s put in cap capital letters with a definite article like
every reader should know what it is and be completely familiar with what your mean.
<U+F09E> Why “the”? It is the only such tool in existence? If not then “a” would be better. Maybe
explain a little about how this cross sectioning is done? Is it mechanical? Ion beam milling?
Response: Thank you for the comments. We have modified the abstract, and the phrase “the Cross
Section Polisher” is changed to “a cross section polisher” in p 9. Revised parts are indicated in
red letters. About a cross section polisher, we have explained it in p14 in original article,
“Therefore, the CP, which mainly consists of…”. We indicated the pertinent part in revised paper
(p14 in red letters).
Comment in the copy:
<U+F09E> How do you know that the SEM observations relate directly to the situation with living
cells?
Response: Thank you for the comment. We removed the word “direct” (p 4 in red letters).
Comment 3: It is more interesting that you could not see problems with viability of the insect
cells on aluminium with presumably just a native oxide. Possibly the material is more stable at
the pH used for the insect cell culture?
Response: Thank you for the comments. We wrote incorrectly about the pH of culture media in
the original paper. The correct pH of the medium used for Sf21 cells was 6.4 and that for the
HEK293T cells was 7.8 (revised manuscript, p 20 in red letters). We confirmed that the aluminum
substrates were stable at least for 5 days in the culture medium of Sf21 cells. We modified the
description in the main text (p 20 in red letters) of the revised manuscript.
Again, thank you for giving us the opportunity to strengthen our manuscript with your valuable
comments and queries. We look forward to hearing from you regarding our submission. We would
be glad to respond to any further questions and comments that you may have.
