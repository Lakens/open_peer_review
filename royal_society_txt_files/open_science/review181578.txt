The authors of the paper entitled: “TiO2 thin films by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis as photocatalytic
material for air purification”, presented the study of deposited TiO2 thin films by ultrasonic
spray pyrolysis method. The scientific motivation has been presented in a satisfactory way. The
structural, morphological, optical properties and surface chemical composition were investigated
to understand probable factors affecting photocatalytic performance for the degradation of
methyl tert-butyl ether in multi-section plug-flow reactor and wettability of the TiO2 thin films.
The novelty of the investigation was the study of chemical composition and wettability of the
films, as is not usual in reports on chemically sprayed TiO2 thin films. The Introduction is clearly
writing, as well as the Experimental Part. Results were clearly discussed showing consistency
with other reports.
The paper is very interesting to me as well as found novelty of research finding. The manuscript
is also well organized and I think it's suitable for the publication on Royal Society Open Science.

Review report: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
Authors, the paper requires major changes with the better explanation. Here are my
suggestions, questions, and confusion regarding your submission.
I recommend accepting the paper after a major revision.
Comment 1: In the introduction of the manuscript, the authors have not given any
information about the studies carried by the other researchers which are similar
with their study.
Answer: The authors would like to thank the referee for his/her valuable remark. The
introduction of the manuscript was improved accordingly.
Added text:
It now reads in the revised version on:
Page 2, 5th paragraph:
“Different methods have been used to fabricate photoactive TiO2 thin films
for air purification such as sol-gel dip coating, spin coating, chemical vapor
deposition sputtering and, electrochemically assisted deposition.
Additionally, several studies have been done about photocatalytic
decomposition of gas-phase MTBE on immobilized commercial TiO2 (P25)
particles coated onto photocatalytic reactors, which are mostly annular
tubular batch reactor or continuous reactors. However, a limited number of
chemical deposition methods have been used to fabricate unmodified and
transparent TiO2 thin films for photocatalytic oxidation of gaseous organic
pollutants.”
Page 2, 6th paragraph:
“Paola et al. [4] have used sol-gel dip coating technique to deposit TiO2 thin
films of different thickness (100-300 nm; transparency 70%) on glass
substrates and test their photocatalytic activity for degradation of gaseous 2-
propanol. It was reported that the highest degradation rate was obtained on
the film with the thickness value of 250 nm [8]. Ardizzone et al. [17] deposited
single and double layer TiO2 thin films on glass substrates by electrochemically
assisted method. The average thickness of the films and transparency was 450
nm and 75%, respectively. TiO2 thin films with double layer showed 100%
ethanol (275 ppm) degradation in 120 min under UV irradiation [17].”
Page 2, 7th paragraph:
“Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis is a simple, fast, inexpensive and freely applicable
method of deposition for large area coatings. Despite the easy scale up in
industry and the possibility to promptly cover large areas, to the best of our
knowledge, there is a very limited number of studies about TiO2 thin films
deposited by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis in the literature. Da et al. [18] prepared
TiO2 and N-doped TiO2 thin films and Rasoulnezhad et al. [19] deposited TiO2
and Fe-doped TiO2 thin films on glass substrates by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis.
The photocatalytic activity of coatings was studied by the degradation of
methylene blue in aqueous phase under UV or visible light.”
Comment 2: The authors would like to thank the referee for his/her valuable
remark. The introduction of the manuscript was improved accordingly.
Answer:
In the present study, TiO2 thin films were composed by sols derived from
titanium tetraisopropoxide precursor. Films showed high transparency in
visible spectral region. The study of the photocatalytic activity of thin films
was carried out in a multi-section plug-flow photocatalytic reactor. Besides,
the TiO2 thin films were deposited by the ultrasonic spray pyrolysis method,
which was used before only to test the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 thin film
for dye degradation in water treatment applications. On the other hand, we
investigated wettability behavior of TiO2 thin films, which is an important
property of the window coatings for outdoor air treatment.
Added text:
It now reads in the revised version on:
Page 2, 9th paragraph:
“The present paper is a comprehensive study of unmodified TiO2 thin film
synthesized by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis and applied for the abatement of air
pollutants. No publications on the decomposition of VOC MTBE on
transparent TiO2 thin films fabricated at different temperatures reporting
their photocatalytic activity regarding the materials characteristics were
found available, thus this study would supply more insights into this topic.”
Comment 3: What is the novelty and new contribution of this paper?
Answer:
The combination of following items is considered as novel and original:
<U+F0B7> The first paper on transparent TiO2 thin films (<200nm) for photocatalytic
degradation of MTBE.
<U+F0B7> The method of film deposition, which is ultrasonic spray pyrolysis.
<U+F0B7> The unique reactor for photocatalytic activity test, which is multi-section
plug-flow photocatalytic reactor.
Comment 4:
Authors should absolutely specify the new results reported in this work
compared to other results.
Answer:
The new results compared to TiO2 thin films deposited by wet-chemical
deposition methods are;
a) Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis proved, as a promising technique for the
deposition of TiO2 thin films for air purification applications.
b) Multi-section plug-flow reactor is highly convenient to test photocatalytic
activity of TiO2 coatings by following the degradation of gaseous organic
pollutants.
c) The results of photocatalytic activity study showed the high influence of the
deposition temperature on the specific surface properties of the TiO2 thin
films deposited by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis.
d) The wettability results of TiO2 thin films, which exhibited superhydrophlic
behaviour even for the aged samples.
Comment 5: More and proper discussion about the results is necessary.
Answer: The authors have made the following amendments to the results and
discussion section:
Added texts:
It now reads in the revised version on:
4.1. Surface Morphology:
Page 4, 2nd paragraph:
“The increase in the film thickness with deposition temperature has been
found also in other studies, e.g. in case of ZrO2 and TiO2 deposition by spray
pyrolysis [21, 22].”
4.2. Structural Properties
Page 5, 3rd paragraph:
“Similar behaviour, where the crystallinity of the film was controlled by both
the deposition and annealing temperature, has been observed also for TiO2
thin films deposited by pulsed pneumatic spray pyrolysis method [22].”
4.4. Chemical Composition and Wettability
Page 7, 4rd paragraph:
“A decrease in the amount of OH- groups was observed in TiO2 thin films
deposited by sol-gel methods: Simonsen et al. [30] reported a decrease in OH-
groups on the microwave assisted sol-gel TiO2 thin films with the increase in
calcination temperature. Chen et al. [28] studied TiO2 thin film grown by sol-
gel spin coating and reported an increase of in the number of hydroxyl groups
with an increase of film thickness; but with a further growth of thickness a
decrease in the amount of OH- groups on the film surface was observed.
Ennaceri et al. [31] reported gradually increase in the amount of surface OH-
groups with the increase in the thickness of the TiO2 thin films deposited by
ultrasonic spray pyrolysis. The results of present study disagree with the
observation study of Ennaceri et al. [31] because the TiO2 thin film deposited
at 450 oC is thicker than the sample deposited at 350 oC, showing the high
influence of deposition temperature on the surface chemical features.
Furthermore, following the [Vo]/[Ti-O] ratios, the amount of oxygen vacancies
on the surface of TiO2 films increased with the increase in the deposition
temperature from 250 to 350 oC (Table 2). It was found that the highest
amount of oxygen vacancies on the TiO2 film surface belongs to the film
fabricated at 350 oC (Table 2). The lower number of oxygen vacancies defects
on TiO2 thin film deposited at 450 oC could be attributed to the higher
deposition temperature: the intensive heat treatment could repair the oxygen
vacancy defects. Liu et al. [32] studied TiO2 thin films deposited by ultrasonic
spray pyrolysis and annealed at different temperatures; a decrease in oxygen
surface defects on TiO2 thin film with an increase in annealing temperature
was reported.”
Page 7, 5th paragraph:
“Thus, XPS results showed that the film deposited at 350 oC has the highest
amount of OH- groups and oxygen vacancy defects and less carbon content on
the surface of the film (Table 2). The OH- on TiO2 surface are considered very
effective for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants as they are
generally the precursors of hydroxyl radicals. In addition, the surface oxygen
vacancy defects are crucial because water can dissociate on oxygen vacancies
with the formation of two bridging OH- groups creating more OH- groups on
the film surface, which is beneficial for adsorbing VOCs by forming hydrogen
bonds with functional groups [28, 33]. The carbon impurities were found
giving an inhibiting effect to the active sites on the surface of TiO2 thin films,
and thus decreasing the photocatalytic activity [14].”
Page 7, 8th paragraph:
“Additionally, the presence of the surface oxygen defects enhance the wetting
properties, leading to the trapping of OH- groups [28]. Simonsen et al. [30]
studied the effect of OH- groups on superhydrophilic properties of TiO2 thin
films with different characteristics: a linear correlation between the OH-
amount on the surface of the film and the water CA was observed. On the
other hand, Chen et al. reported that the TiO2 thin film which has the lowest
level of OH- and Vo, also demonstrated the superhydrophilic property under
UV light [28].”
4.5. Photocatalytic Activity
Page 9, 7th paragraph:
“In the present study, the thickness of TiO2 thin films increased with an
increase to the deposition temperature (Table 1). It has been reported [44]
that higher photocatalytic activity is attributed to a rougher surface of the film
with higher thickness. However, in several studies, it has been reported that
with the further increase in the thickness of films, the length of the migration
path of the carriers to the surface of the catalyst increases while their
generation rate remains constant; the charge carriers experience higher
recombination rates, resulting in an overall decrease in the photocatalytic
activity [44]. This could be another reason of lower photocatalytic activity of
the TiO2 thin film deposited at 450 oC if compared to the TiO2 film deposited
at 350 oC.”
Page 9, 8th paragraph:
“Usually, it is quite difficult to compare the photocatalytic performance of thin
films with that of coatings obtained from nanoparticles. The specific quantity
of TiO2 expressed as mg of titania per cm2 of surface area of the coating could
serve for a proper comparison of different studies regarding the
photocatalytic oxidation of MTBE. In the present study, the specific quantity
of TiO2 in the film deposited at 350 oC was around 0.2 mg cm-2, achieving 80%
conversion of MTBE on a coated window glass with the surface area of 600
cm2. Preis et al. [6] reported the specific quantity of TiO2 (P25) in the coated
reactor (640 cm2) as 1.4 mg cm-2. The 30% conversion of MTBE (inlet
concentration of 100 ppm) with acetone detected as the only gas-phase by-
product was observed in this reactor (the reactor temperature was 59.8 oC).
Galanos et al. [5] indicated the specific quantity of TiO2 in the coated reactor
as 3.5 mg cm-2. This TiO2 coating showed 90% of MTBE (500 ppm) conversion
in up to 36.6 sec. of residence time. Acetone and TBF were the only
intermediate by-products detected during the photocatalytic reaction. Park
et al. [4] presented the calculated reaction rate values during the
photocatalytic degradation of MTBE as a function of different specific
quantities of TiO2. It has been found that the highest reaction rate (0.85 µmol
min-1) was obtained with the TiO2 (P25) coating of 0.6 mg cm-2 and that the
reaction rate stayed constant even after the increase in the specific catalyst
quantity.”
Comment 6: Explain the increase and the decrease of grain size.
Answer:
The authors would like to thank the referee for his/her valuable remark. The
grain size is influenced by the deposition temperature of the TiO 2 films. As
seen from SEM images Fig 1, the grain size is increasing with increasing
deposition temperature. While the surface of the film deposited at 250 oC and
annealed at 500 oC consists of grains with a size of ca 20 nm, the film deposited
at 450 o C and annealed at 500 oC consists of grains with a size of ca 50 nm.
However, an increase and a decrease were observed in the mean crystallite
size. Even though the annealing temperature (500 oC) is same, the crystallite
size are different regarding to the differences in growing temperature. There
is an increase in the mean crystallite size from 13 nm to 35 nm when the
deposition temperature increases from 250 to 350 oC, while the TiO2 film
deposited at 450 oC showed 32 nm. The slight decrease of ca. 3 nm could be
attributed to the fitting error, which is ca 10%.
Comment 7: How much the thickness values of the films?
Answer: Thank you for the question. We agree with referee that thickness
optimization is needed. In our studies, we kept all deposition parameters constant,
except deposition temperature. Therefore, we can relate film thickness and specific
surface properties to the specific deposition temperature.
It now reads in the revised version on:
Page 9, 8th paragraph:
“In the present study, the thickness of TiO2 thin films increased with an
increase to the deposition temperature (Table 1). It has been reported [44]
that higher photocatalytic activity is attributed to a rougher surface of the film
with higher thickness. However, in several studies, it has been reported that
with the further increase in the thickness of films, the length of the migration
path of the carriers to the surface of the catalyst increases while their
generation rate remains constant; the charge carriers experience higher
recombination rates, resulting in an overall decrease in the photocatalytic
activity [44]. This could be another reason of lower photocatalytic activity of
the TiO2 thin film deposited at 450 oC if compared to the TiO2 film deposited
at 350 oC.”
Comment 8: The English grammar should be reviewed.
Answer:
The English was polished according to the remark of the Reviewer.
We appreciate very much for the valuable comments by the Reviewers and hope
that the revised manuscript would now be acceptable for printing in ROS.
