Lim et al. reported the eDNA metabarcoding in the tropics using metazoan universal primers,
and detected more than 500 species by eDNA. Authors concluded that there is a lot of potential of
eDNA metabarcoding as a minimally invasive method for ecological survey or regular
bioassesment. The use of metazoan universal primers for eDNA studies is new and important.
The manuscript is conscious and clearly written. However, I have several concerns, most of
which are minor, before publication as shown below:
1. Authors claimed that “it remains unclear whether eDNA will be useful for characterizing
tropical ecosystems”, however, application of eDNA techniques for tropics is not new. For my
knowledge there are at least two published papers (Robson et al., 2015 Molecular Ecology
Resources; Eva et al. 2016 Global Ecology and Conservation). Authors should cite these papers
and discuss on the common and different points.
2. Again on the tropics. What is the technical improvement for applying eDNA metabarcoding to
the tropics? Readers expect new techniques from reading of the title, abstract, and introduction.
However, nothing is described in the following sections.
3. Discussion about the PCR inhibition is missing. For eDNA studies, the PCR inhibition should
be a serious problem. I recommend authors to discuss on this.
4. Line 41: Miya et al. (2015; Royal Society Open Science) should be cited here.
5. Lines 47-49: Robson et al. (2015; Molecular Ecology Resources) and Eva et al. (2016; Global

6. Lines 89-92: The PCR conditions are missing.

8. Line 198: delete “only”.
9. Line 206: delete “Surprisingly”.
10. Results: Comparisons between surface and benthic samples at each sampling site are very
interesting and should be described.
11. Discussion: What species cannot be detected by eDNA metabarcoding? There are any
taxonomic bias? The usefulness / un-usefulness of this primer set should be clarified.
12. Lines 243-246: Increasing the replications of PCR can mitigate the PCR bias problems. I
recommend authors to describe this point.

I have provided a pdf file (summary of comments) that shows my detailed review of the
manuscript, so largely will not repeat them here. You have done some interesting analyses and
meaningful comparisons of next-generation eDNA techniques, as far as the paper goes. I do
believe this paper should be accepted with minor revision, but I also think you could go further
by placing your results in the context of the goals and objectives of currently accepted biological
assessment protocols. Specifically, I am thinking about multimetric indexes (Indexes of Biotic
Integrity), RIVPACS, O/E models, etc., and how community/assemblage level data from eDNA
analyses can be translated to rigorous, objective decision-making that those protocols provide.
There is a lot of promise with your work for biological monitoring and assessment, and you're in
a good position to move it forward. You could demonstrate how it improves upon what is
already done, and I'm saying to go further than just saying that the technique more completely
documents biological diversity. What's needed is to show how that can fit into the decision-
making frameworks of environmental regulations, such as the US Clean Water Act and the EU
Water Directive Framework. I am not familiar with environmental regulations in Singapore, but
the indexes I mention above were largely developed to bring science to the regulations, and their
applications do consider ecosystem processes in monitoring/sampling design, evaluation and
documentation of data quality (precision, accuracy, bias, etc.), and the rigor and defensibility of
calling a site or waterbody degraded or impaired. Keep in mind that if assessment results
(impaired/nonimpaired) cannot be communicated in a relatively straightforward and
meaningful manner, the likelihood that they would be acted on would be diminished. Again, I do
think this paper is acceptable for publication with minor revision, but would like to see some
consideration of these other issues. (See Appendix A)

Demonstrating high species diversity using genetics methods is pretty routine these days, and so, not particularly
noteworthy. I'd like to suggest a different potential title, at least to think about:

15 9 Abstract
16
17 10 Freshwater habitats are of high conservation value and provide a wide range of
18
19
20
11 ecosystem services. Effective management requires regular monitoring. However,
21
22 12 conventional methods based on direct observation or specimen collection are so
23
24 13 invasive, expensive and labour-intensive that frequent monitoring is uncommon.
25
26 14 Here, we test whether the evaluation of environmental DNA (eDNA) from water
27
28 15 based on a simple protocol can be used for assessing biodiversity in tropical habitats.
29
30
31 16 We use universal metazoan primers for characterizing water eDNA across horizontal
32
33 17 and vertical spatial dimensions in two reservoirs with known species diversity for two
34
35 18 key taxa. eDNA obtained directly from 42 samples × 15 mL water (total = 630 mL)
36
37 19 per reservoir yielded DNA signatures for >500 metazoan species, of which 105 could
38
39
40
20 be identified to species/genus. We show that eDNA can be used to assign each
41
42 21 water sample to their reservoirs of origin, that eDNA outperforms conventional
43
44 22 survey methods in single-sample comparisons, while revealing evidence for
45
46 23 hundreds of unknown species that are undetected by conventional bioassessment
47
48 24 methods. eDNA also confirms the presence of a new invasive snail species and
49
50
51 25 provides evidence for the survival of a rare native species of goby not sighted in that
52
53 26 habitat since 2007. eDNA thus promises to be a useful addition to the
54
55 27 bioassessment toolbox for tropical freshwater systems.

3 29 Introduction
4
5
6 30 Only a relatively small proportion of the Earth’s surface is fresh water, but freshwater
7
8 31 habitats are home to a disproportionately large number of species [1] while being
9
10 32 extensively used by humans for a wide range of ecosystem services. It is thus
11
12
13 33 important to regularly assess their ecological health and develop effective monitoring
14
15 34 techniques. Central to effective biomonitoring, conservation and management is the
16
17 35 ability to assess aquatic faunal communities regularly, with minimal impact, and at
18
19 36 acceptable cost. Conventional methods relying on collecting target species or
20
21
37 communities are time-consuming, labour-intensive, invasive, and rarely yield
22
23
24 38 species-level information for invertebrates.
25
26
27 39 Advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies now allow for the
28
29 40 evaluation of environmental DNA (eDNA) either via metagenomics [2,3] or
30
31 41 metabarcoding [4–7]. Both techniques rely on detecting species based on trace DNA
32
33 42 in the environment. This can be particularly useful for biomonitoring, because
34
35
43 obtaining eDNA from fresh water is cost-effective and minimally-invasive. Use of
36
37
38 44 freshwater eDNA for the detection of particular taxa (e.g., fish, amphibians, insects
39
40 45 [7–11]) is now routine in some temperate habitats, but it is unclear whether whole
41
42 46 communities can be characterized using universal primers that amplify across
43
44 47 Metazoa [8,9,12–15]. In addition, it remains unclear whether eDNA will be useful for
45
46
47 48 characterizing tropical ecosystems, which have higher species diversity and where
48
49 49 higher temperatures are likely to expedite DNA degradation. Lastly, it remains to be
50
51 50 seen whether eDNA samples from different freshwater bodies, sampling sites, and
52
53 51 sampling depths contain similar signatures.

3 52 Here, we present a proof-of-concept for eDNA metabarcoding in tropical fresh waters
4
5 53 with a single metazoan COI primer pair [12,13]. Our study focused on two urban
6
7
54 freshwater reservoirs in Singapore where ongoing biodiversity studies have yielded
8
9
10 55 species lists for validation of eDNA results. Based on historical physicochemical data,
11
12 56 one has somewhat better water quality than the other, but they do not represent
13
14 57 extremes across the 14 reservoirs in Singapore [16]. Here we estimate the metazoan
15
16 58 species richness in each reservoir based on multiple sites (seven per reservoir) and
17
18
19 59 depths (two per site), validate eDNA results for key taxa with species lists from multi-
20
21 60 year comprehensive surveys. Lastly, we compare community structure between and
22
23 61 within reservoirs and examine whether presence-absence data reveals habitat-
24
25 62 specific signatures independently of sequencing read counts.

35
36 66 E) and Pandan (1.3154° N, 103.7434° E) Reservoirs, Singapore. Six of the sites
37
38 67 corresponded to sites where electrofishing was performed by the Freshwater and
39

42
43 69 site was close to the centre with the greatest depth (Table S1, Fig S1a–b:

45 70 Supplementary Materials and Methods). Water samples were collected using Van
46
47 71 Dorn horizontal water samplers; one sampler was used for surface samples (~0.5 m
48

174 MOTUs). Ninety-five of the MOTUs were common to both reservoirs, while the
8

10 175 majority were reservoir-specific (Fig 1a). MOTU accumulation curves suggest that
11
12 176 further sampling would reveal additional MOTUs; they also show that MOTU

15

180 Comparison between eDNA detection and conventional surveys
22
23
24 181 To compare species compositions based on eDNA and conventional surveys, we
25
26
27 182 first assigned MOTUs to various taxonomic hierarchies. We could assign 229
28
29 183 MOTUs (44.4%) to a phylum, of which only 105 were identified to species
30
31 184 (Supplementary File 1). In agreement with overall richness comparisons, we found
32
33 185 Bedok to be more species-rich than Pandan in specific taxa such as fish (20 vs 9
34
35
186 MOTUs), odonates (35 vs 8 MOTUs), chironomids (17 vs 11 MOTUs) and culicids
36
37
38 187 (10 vs 0 MOTUs). We assigned 125 MOTUs their most probable identities using
39
40 188 local unpublished databases, 79 using BOLD and the remaining 25 using GenBank.
41
42 189 Over half of the identified MOTUs corresponded to arthropods, while chordates
43
44 190 formed the second largest group (Fig S3a). Unsurprisingly, the largest number of
45

this is information that begs a few questions of what is special about the species/taxa that are waterbody specific.
That is, are they truly waterbody specific, or is there some kind of sampling error that prevented their detection?
There may also be some physical or chemical habitat conditions in one of the waterbodies that prevents habitation
by some species; there could also be some natural enemies (predators/parasites) or diseases that exclude them.
Interesting stuff. I vote for sampling error, but can't know for sure. This is where you would need to have a
sampling design that had some level of within-waterbody replication...will be critical for developing indicator and
long term/routine application

18
19
20 203 When comparing all MOTUs using presence-absence data, the NMDS plot reveals
21
22 204 distinct separation between Bedok and Pandan MOTU communities (Fig 2a). When
23
24 205 considering only common MOTUs, similar patterns are observed (Fig 2b).
25
26
27 206 Surprisingly, use of rank sequencing read counts led to the same qualitative
28
29 207 conclusions (Fig S4a–b), which are also supported by the lower Renkonen similarity
30
31 208 (P) between reservoirs (all MOTUs P = 0.177; common MOTUs P = 0.177) than that
32
33 209 between nearly any two sampling points within a reservoir (all MOTUs Table S2;
34
35
210 common MOTUs Table S3). Based on Jaccard dissimilarities computed from
36
37
38 211 presence-absence data, all Bedok samples are more similar to the Bedok reservoir-
39
40 212 specific profile than Pandan samples, and likewise all Pandan samples are more
41
42 213 similar to the Pandan reservoir-specific profile (Fig 3a; Supplementary File 2).
43
44 214 Excluding rare MOTUs from comparison yielded a qualitatively similar result (Fig 3b).
45
46
47 215 Together with the patterns revealed by the NMDS plots, this is compelling evidence
48
49 216 that eDNA samples carry reservoir-specific signatures based on species

this is good. will now need to be able to show that there is a detectable difference between reservoirs that are
stressed (polluted) versus those that aren't. There is no reason to think this is not doable, just need to get eDNA
samples from waterbodies with known pollutants or pollution sources (point sources and/or nonpoint sources), and
show that the eDNA signatures differ among them. For routine biomonitoring, will need to standardize field
sampling protocols, and go through calibration of the indicator

3 219 With just 630 mL of water collected from each reservoir in a virtually non-invasive
4
5 220 manner within six hours, eDNA metabarcoding detected over 500 metazoan MOTUs
6
7
221 using a single primer pair. One in five of these MOTUs can be identified with
8
9
10 222 confidence to species across seven phyla. Analyses of the amplified products using
11
12 223 high-throughput sequencing led to diversity inferences that are confirmed by our
13
14 224 current knowledge of the two reservoirs. Bedok Reservoir is known to be more
15
16 225 species-rich based on species lists obtained with conventional methods for several
17
18
19 226 taxa including fish and chironomid species. We also demonstrate that eDNA
20
21 227 provides more complete species lists per sampling event than conventional survey
22
23 228 methods. This, coupled with the species-level resolution provided by DNA barcodes
24
25 229 suggests that the analysis of eDNA has the potential to become a powerful
26
27
230 bioassessment tool for water quality.
28
29
30 231 We found that MOTU presence-absence data reliably distinguishes eDNA samples
31
32
33 232 from the two reservoirs based on species composition alone. Excluding rare MOTUs
34
35 233 from comparisons led to the same conclusion but the reservoir-specific signatures
36
37 234 were even stronger. This suggests that eDNA metabarcoding can reproducibly
38
39 235 reveal habitat-specific signatures and allow a sample to be matched to its source
40
41
236 without requiring the use of sequencing read counts as a proxy for abundance data.
42
43
44 237 Conventional bioassessment techniques frequently rely on abundance counts of taxa
45
46 238 identified with low taxonomic resolution (e.g., genus, family) [32,33]. With eDNA,
47
48 239 quantitative information comes in the form of read counts, but we recommend
49
50 240 caution when treating read counts as a proxy for organism abundance. We found, for
51
52
53 241 instance, that sequencing read counts for fish MOTUs correlate poorly with
54
55 242 electrofishing catch counts and weights (Fig S5a–b). This result is not surprising
56
57 243 given that quantitative biases in metabarcoding are expected [34]. For example,

3 244 eDNA capture and PCR have strong stochastic effects [35] which is confirmed by
4
5 245 finding poor correlations between read counts from different PCR replicates for the
6
7
246 same DNA extraction. We submit that future biomonitoring based on eDNA could
8
9
10 247 conceivably rely on MOTU richness alone. A key strength of eDNA lies in detecting
11
12 248 large numbers of species at high taxonomic resolution. With presence-absence data
13
14 249 already able to reveal habitat-specific species composition signatures in eDNA
15
16 250 samples, we suggest that next-generation bioassessment could potentially depend
17
18
19 251 on overall species richness, or on abundance information derived from incidence
20
21 252 frequencies rather than sequencing read counts.
22
23
24 253 Our study reveals signatures for >500 MOTUs, and the stability of MOTU counts
25
26 254 across p-distance thresholds attests to the reliability of the data. Biologists may
27
28 255 question the value of using unidentified MOTUs. However, even unidentified MOTUs
29
30 256 can be matched across different samples and habitats and could be used for the
31
32
33 257 analysis of community structure. Currently, only about one in five MOTUs could be
34
35 258 identified to species; over half of these based on local barcode databases populated
36
37 259 using specimens collected in Singapore. This emphasizes the need for generating
38
39 260 more complete barcode databases, especially in species-rich tropical ecosystems,
40
41
261 which would then increase the proportion of MOTUs that can be matched to a
42
43
44 262 scientific name [36]. Finding large numbers of unidentifiable MOTUs underscores the
45
46 263 power of eDNA in finding new species, but eDNA also proved useful for detecting
47
48 264 rare species. We found evidence for the presence of the bigmouth stream goby
49
50 265 (Pseudogobiopsis oligactis) in Bedok Reservoir. This rare native species has not
51
52
53 266 been recorded in Bedok Reservoir since 2007, and was thought to be extirpated in
54
55 267 Singapore until its rediscovery in a stream elsewhere [37,38]. We also detected in

this is getting at the different metrics that are widely used as part of indexes of biological integrity. Some metrics
rely on taxa counts per sample (e.g., EPT index, number of genera as Spionidae, etc.) while others on sample
composition (e.g., percent individuals as Hydropsychidae, percent stressor tolerant individuals, etc.). I suspect
what this could POSSIBLY lead to is not necessarily needing to use the multimetric index. The absolute key is
whether the final biological indicator value (whatever it is) can distinguish between sample locations (or
waterbodies) that are stressed (=polluted, or otherwise degraded) from those that are in non or minimally degraded
conditions.
Author:James.Stribling Subject:Comment on Text Date:10/15/2016 11:30:57 AM
Increasing the scale and reach of barcode databases is critical, I agree. BUT, I think you should consider
developing some kind of metric or index of genetic diversity that can be calculated without necessarily worrying
about Linnean labels. It would be interesting to see how that index quantity compared between polluted and non-
polluted waterbodies.

4

6
7
271 surveys. Additionally, the large number of unidentified MOTUs highlights the need to
8
9
10 272 study zooplankton such as rotifers and microcrustaceans. We predict that as the use
11
12 273 of eDNA gains prominence, freshwater zooplankton may become more important for
13
14 274 freshwater bioassessment, which is desirable because they are likely to respond
15
16 275 quickly to changes in water quality.
17
18
19 276 Our study is not without problems; our MOTU list contained a small number of
20
21
277 unexpected identifications (n = 15; 2.9% of all MOTUs), including highly
22
23
24 278 environmentally sensitive odonates which are not known to be found in the
25
26 279 reservoirs [Yeo D & Ngiam RWJ, pers. comm.]. This highlights one potential problem
27
28 280 with eDNA when assessing interconnected freshwater habitats such as reservoirs
29
30 281 and catchments. The persistence of eDNA in water [40] can generate false positives.
31
32
33 282 These are difficult to eliminate without sophisticated theoretical models and
34
35 283 comprehensive information on water movement. The persistence of eDNA probably
36
37 284 also explains the high diversity found in benthic samples collected from hypoxic or
38
39 285 anoxic waters. Lastly, even with many control measures in place, eDNA samples are
40
41
286 likely to get cross-contaminated during laboratory procedures (PCR, library
42
43
44 287 preparation, sequencing). Nonetheless, we only found a relatively small number of
45

Responses to Reviewers’ Comments
Reviewer comment 1. Authors claimed that “it remains unclear whether eDNA will be useful for
characterizing tropical ecosystems”, however, application of eDNA techniques for tropics is not new. For
my knowledge there are at least two published papers (Robson et al., 2015 Molecular Ecology
Resources; Eva et al. 2016 Global Ecology and Conservation). Authors should cite these papers and
discuss on the common and different points.
and
Reviewer comment 2. Again on the tropics. What is the technical improvement for applying eDNA
metabarcoding to the tropics? Readers expect new techniques from reading of the title, abstract, and
introduction. However, nothing is described in the following sections.
REPLY:
To our knowledge, our study is the first to analyze entire metazoan communities from total eDNA
extraction from water. This is now emphasized and the discussion of the special challenges in the tropics
is reduced. Note that the studies mentioned by the reviewer use taxon-specific primers and DNA
extracted from filtrate instead of free water. These studies are now cited.
We have edited the relevant paragraphs to read: “Use of freshwater eDNA for the detection of particular
taxa (e.g., fish, amphibians, insects [7,9–13]) is now routine, but it is unclear whether whole
communities can be characterized using universal primers that amplify across Metazoa and are applied
to eDNA obtained from water without filtration [9,10,14–17]. In addition, very little is known about the
utility of eDNA in the tropics where higher temperatures are likely to expedite DNA degradation. Existing
studies have been largely taxon-specific and/or used filtration prior to DNA extraction [13,18].”
Reviewer comment 3. Discussion about the PCR inhibition is missing. For eDNA studies, the PCR
inhibition should be a serious problem. I recommend authors to discuss on this.
REPLY:
We have moved the information on PCR conditions from Supplementary Materials & Methods to the
Materials & Methods section in the main text.

REPLY:

Reviewer comment 9. Line 206: delete “Surprisingly”.
REPLY:
Done.
Reviewer comment 10. Results: Comparisons between surface and benthic samples at each sampling
site are very interesting and should be described.
REPLY:
We agree that this is an interesting finding, but it is also one that is difficult to interpret. We are
expressing our surprise that the species richness is similar and that there is good species overlap: “The
persistence of eDNA probably also explains the high diversity and surprisingly large species overlap
found between surface and benthic samples collected from hypoxic or anoxic waters.”.
Reviewer comment 11. Discussion: What species cannot be detected by eDNA metabarcoding? There are
any taxonomic bias? The usefulness / un-usefulness of this primer set should be clarified.
REPLY:
It is difficult to assess taxonomic bias without more species-level work using traditional techniques. This
is work progress and we would prefer not to comment on this issue. The taxonomic biases of the primers
that we use are discussed in the original Leray paper that is cited.
Reviewer comment 12. Lines 243-246: Increasing the replications of PCR can mitigate the PCR bias
problems. I recommend authors to describe this point.
REPLY:
Added a sentence: “Bias caused by PCR drift can however be partially mitigated by increasing the
number of replicates performed.”

Demonstrating high species diversity using genetics methods is pretty routine these days, and so, not
particularly noteworthy. I'd like to suggest a different potential title, at least to think about:
"Investigating aquatic biological indicators using next-generation eDNA techniques in tropical freshwater
systems".
We have modified the title to better express what sets our study apart: “Next-generation freshwater
bioassessment: eDNA metabarcoding with a conserved metazoan primer reveals high species richness
and reservoir-specific species communities”

of greatest importance to biological monitoring practitioners is whether the technique can help
distinguish AMONG sites, that is, quantify differences
REPLY:
We have edited the statement to “…contain similar signatures which allow them to be distinguished from
one another.”

this is important for large scale biological monitoring programs, that is, clarity of biological signal as
associated with environmental factors
REPLY:
The biological signal in our study is clear. As discussed in the revised manuscript, the next step is
working on the spatial and temporal stability and the correlation with environmental parameters.

this is key. Are these numbers user-defined, or do they represent some kind of recognized standard?
REPLY:
The 97% match requirement is derived from the 3% pairwise distance threshold that has been proposed
as a standard threshold to delimit sequences to species units using COI (Hebert et al. 2003 Proc. R. Soc.
B).

this is information that begs a few questions of what is special about the species/taxa that are
waterbody specific. That is, are they truly waterbody specific, or is there some kind of sampling error
that prevented their detection? There may also be some physical or chemical habitat conditions in one of
the waterbodies that prevents habitation by some species; there could also be some natural enemies
(predators/parasites) or diseases that exclude them. Interesting stuff. I vote for sampling error, but
can't know for sure. This is where you would need to have a sampling design that had some level of
within-waterbody replication...will be critical for developing indicator and long term/routine application
REPLY:
We agree that these findings are very interesting. However, sampling error is extremely unlikely
because we sampled 7 sites and 2 different depth for each reservoir and each sample can be
unambiguously assigned to its reservoir.

Because there would be much more bulk genetic material by volume in the samples (chordates vs.
inverts)? This needs to be clearly stated...
REPLY:
We believe that this is due to, in general, the large relative biomass per individual (and large
corresponding eDNA shedding rate). However, there is little evidence and literature on the subject
matter. That’s why we have elected to remove “Unsurprisingly,..”.

this is a really nice analysis
Author:James.Stribling Subject:Sticky Note Date:10/19/2016 6:35:35 AM
this is good. will now need to be able to show that there is a detectable difference between reservoirs
that are stressed (polluted) versus those that aren't. There is no reason to think this is not doable, just
need to get eDNA samples from waterbodies with known pollutants or pollution sources (point sources
and/or nonpoint sources), and show that the eDNA signatures differ among them. For routine
biomonitoring, will need to standardize field sampling protocols, and go through calibration of the
indicator
REPLY:
We agree and this strategy for future research is now outlined in the revised manuscript.

Agreed
Author:James.Stribling Subject:Comment on Text Date:10/15/2016 11:18:59 AM
this is getting at the different metrics that are widely used as part of indexes of biological integrity.
Some metrics rely on taxa counts per sample (e.g., EPT index, number of genera as Spionidae, etc.)
while others on sample composition (e.g., percent individuals as Hydropsychidae, percent stressor
tolerant individuals, etc.). I suspect what this could POSSIBLY lead to is not necessarily needing to use
the multimetric index. The absolute key is whether the final biological indicator value (whatever it is) can
distinguish between sample locations (or waterbodies) that are stressed (=polluted, or otherwise
degraded) from those that are in non or minimally degraded conditions.
Author:James.Stribling Subject:Comment on Text Date:10/15/2016 11:30:57 AM
Increasing the scale and reach of barcode databases is critical, I agree. BUT, I think you should consider
developing some kind of metric or index of genetic diversity that can be calculated without necessarily
worrying about Linnean labels. It would be interesting to see how that index quantity compared between
polluted and nonpolluted waterbodies.
REPLY:
We agree and in many ways the MOTU count for the reservoirs and samples is such an index.
Author:James.Stribling Subject:Comment on Text Date:10/15/2016 11:31:41 AM
agreed
Author:James.Stribling Subject:Comment on Text Date:10/18/2016 8:08:30 AM
this is where a smart monitoring/sampling design with solid and well thought out data quality objectives
comes in...you need to understand something about the physical and hydrologic (potentially, hydraulic)
processes, spatial and temporal distribution of pollutant input and other human activities, to develop
statistically-founded strata for organizing sampling activities
REPLY:
We agree that this is needed for future work.
Author:James.Stribling Subject:Comment on Text Date:10/15/2016 11:37:58 AM
this is something that requires attention, certainly, but pilot studies and a focused and routine quality
control framework can help quantify the frequency of occurrence and acceptability of different error
rates.
Reviewer 2 Comment:
I have provided a pdf file (summary of comments) that shows my detailed review of the manuscript, so
largely will not repeat them here. You have done some interesting analyses and meaningful comparisons
of next-generation eDNA techniques, as far as the paper goes. I do believe this paper should be
accepted with minor revision, but I also think you could go further by placing your results in the context
of the goals and objectives of currently accepted biological assessment protocols. Specifically, I am
thinking about multimetric indexes (Indexes of Biotic Integrity), RIVPACS, O/E models, etc., and how
community/assemblage level data from eDNA analyses can be translated to rigorous, objective decision-
making that those protocols provide. There is a lot of promise with your work for biological monitoring
and assessment, and you're in a good position to move it forward. You could demonstrate how it
improves upon what is already done, and I'm saying to go further than just saying that the technique
more completely documents biological diversity. What's needed is to show how that can fit into the
decision-making frameworks of environmental regulations, such as the US Clean Water Act and the EU
Water Directive Framework. I am not familiar with environmental regulations in Singapore, but the
indexes I mention above were largely developed to bring science to the regulations, and their
applications do consider ecosystem processes in monitoring/sampling design, evaluation and
documentation of data quality (precision, accuracy, bias, etc.), and the rigor and defensibility of calling a
site or waterbody degraded or impaired. Keep in mind that if assessment results (impaired/nonimpaired)
cannot be communicated in a relatively straightforward and meaningful manner, the likelihood that they
would be acted on would be diminished. Again, I do think this paper is acceptable for publication with
minor revision, but would like to see some consideration of these other issues.
REPLY:
We are now addressing these issues in the discussion and outline a research program for developing
eDNA for bioassessment: “Our study demonstrates the viability of using metabarcoded eDNA for
characterizing whole metazoan communities in lentic habitats—an important basis and first step towards
incorporating such molecular methods in biotic indices for environmental-related decision-making. At
this point, however, further research is needed in order to understand the temporal and spatial stability
of eDNA signals within and across multiple reservoirs. Such information will be essential for establishing
standardized field protocols and for developing eDNA-based bioassessment tools. Traditionally,
bioassessment is based on indices of biological integrity that compare species communities of reference
sites (usually with low anthropogenic impact) with communities of assessed (impacted) sites, or that
directly score assessed sites based on presence or absence (and sometimes abundance) of broad
taxonomic groups with varying levels of environmental sensitivity/tolerance. The community information
is currently obtained via time- and resource-consuming field surveys that concentrate on
macroinvertebrates. They are collected, sorted, and identified often only to high taxonomic levels (e.g.,
order, family, genus) using traditional morphological methods. It is here that eDNA can potentially help.
Collecting of water samples is fast and eDNA provides information on more taxa at greater taxonomic
resolution (i.e., down to species level). eDNA thus holds the promise for high-resolution bioassessment
at lower manpower cost. One obstacle would be the need for developing new eDNA-based indices
comparing reference and impacted sites and calibrating environmental responses at higher resolution
(i.e., species level). However, the need for such indices may not be immediate because biological
identifications at greater taxonomic resolution (eDNA: species-level) can be translated to higher
taxonomic level (traditional surveys: order, genus, family). This implies that the currently used indices
of biological integrity can be used as long as eDNA provides information on the same taxonomic groups
and provides suitable abundance information. This should be assessed in follow-up studies that compare
survey results based on traditional and eDNA techniques for the same polluted and unpolluted
habitats.”
