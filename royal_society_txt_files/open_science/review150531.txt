Comments to “Trophic niche divergence among colour morphs that exhibit alternative mating
strategies”
The author studied if colour morphs vary in habitat and diet preferences as in social behaviour in
a trimorphic polychromatic lizard. I found this work very interesting and well conducted. I have
just very few minor comments and suggestions that may improve the paper. It has been a
pleasure reading this manuscript and I strongly recommend its publication.
Comments:
1. A definition of C3 and C4 vegetation should be added at lines 73-74.
2. A justification on the use of isotopes to test the lizard diet is needed in the introduction (for
instance, authors may relocate sentences from the Material and methods, l. 170-174).
3. It could be interesting to discuss a bit more about the relevance of head size differences
between morphs.
4. Figure 2 could be replaced by a sentence.
5. Authors should cite and discuss the recent paper of Scali et al. (2015). Does a polymorphic
species have a ‘polymorphic’ diet? A case study from a lacertid lizard. Biological Journal of the
Linnean Society.
I also suggest that, for future works, authors could contrast results obtained with their
methodology with results obtained with “classical” (i.e. stomach flushing, faecal samples)
methods for analysing morph diets.

This is an interesting and well written ms I relly appreciated. The rationale is clearly presented,
and both methods and results consistent with the hypothesis.
I only have few minor revision, concerning sample size. Indeed, sample sizes used in the analyses
are not immediatly accessible, and should be detailed in the methods
Introduction
- Line54 see also Scali et al 2015 Biol.J.linn.Soc on common wall lizards
- Lines 56-63: this first hypothesis is what has been proposed also for the morphs of common wall
lizards (Scali et al 2015).
Methods
- line121: how long do the effects of fire persist after burning? Between 1980 and 2002 there are
more than 20 years. So, do LB and HB sites actually differ for burning history?
- Line126-129. Were lizards marked? How were home ranges defined by simple captures?
- Par2.1: please supply details on sample sizes, i.e., how many capture points (and individuals,
but I suppose individuals could be recognized by toe clipping) were used for the analyses of the
habitat? Also, how many for each site?
Results
- lines66-267. How was the effect of morphs tested? The first paragraph of the statistical
analyneeds a detailed description of the predictors in the PERMANOVA
- par3.2. Given the d.f of the F statistics reported here and in the previous analyses for habitat
segregation among sites, it seems that different samples sizes were used in the analyses of
isotopic variation with respect habitat structure. Indeed, in par3.1 n ~ 107 while in par3.2 n ~ 149
More details on sample size are needed in the method section
- par3.3. As for the previous paragraph sample size is not clear, as apparently n~ 38 from df of F
stats. And also spatial segregation used the same small sample. More details on sample size are
needed in the method section.
Discussion
- lines 336-339. This is true only for the LB, since at HB no spatial segregation of morphs was
found
- lines 344-346: but see Scali et al 2015

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
This is a well-designed study and generally well-written paper that investigated whether discrete
male reproductive phenotypes of a species of lizard also vary in diet as measured by stable
isotopes. This is a nice study and would make a valuable contribution to the literature except for
one major flaw – the male phenotypes are described in a way that does not match the way they
were described in the paper cited to support the morphs as territorial, satellite and sneaker
(Thompson and Moore 1991).
The populations studied by the authors may well have three distinct morphs with well-
documented behavioral differences, but I could not find good data to support their
categorization, either in the present manuscript or in previous published papers by the authors.
In Lattanzio and Miles. 2014. J. Animal Ecology, the spatial use data presented come from only 10
males at each of 3 sites over 2 years (in total: 11 blue, 6 orange, 13 yellow). This is a very small
data set on which to base categorization of morph behavior, especially because only 5 males at
each site were collected each year and the criterion for capture away from initial capture site was
very weak (<= 3 meters from the initial capture site on a different tree or shrub or on the ground);
a male’s territory could easily encompass two trees or shrubs. The weakest element of the morph
description is describing the yellow morphs as satellites – there are no data to support this, either
in the Moore et al. 1998 paper cited by Lattanzio and Moore (2014), or in that paper itself. I have
re-read both of these papers several times to verify this.
In Lattanzio et al. 2014. PlosONE, there is a figure that clearly shows the tree male dewlap
phenotypes (blue, orange, yellow), with the blue being very different than the orange-blue morph
of Thompson and Moore 1991 and Moore et al. 1998. However, this paper provides little
behavioral data to support the behavioral differences described in the present manuscript.
The manuscript could be saved if the authors toned down the description of the behavior of the
three dewlap phenotypes, indicating only that in other populations dewlap color has been shown
to correlate with aggressive and territorial behavior. Assuming such corrections are made,
especially in the final paragraph and anywhere yellow morphs are described as satellites, I also
have a few other suggestions to improve readability.
Title, line 11 and throughout – Use of the term ‘strategies’ should be replaced with ‘tactics’
because it is not known if the three phenotypes are genetic or not.
16 – Insert ‘reproductive’ before ‘behaviour’ for specificity.
5
80-87 – This section was difficult to follow because it reads in places as if the lizards are feeding
on the vegetation when in fact they are predators. Also, reference 20 is not tree lizard reference as
implied by the wording of this sentence.
149 – How were the sweeps spread across the day?
180 – Were the samples analyzed for the authors? If so, then it should be said that the samples
were sent to the analysis lab.
188 – ‘facilitated’ should be ‘allowed’
310-311 – I believe some references to LB and HB sites is reversed. Please reread carefully while
comparing to figure 3.
312 – should mention that at the LB site non-spider predators had the opposite preference from
the HB site.
338 – I do not think you can say that habitat variation drives spatial segregation of the morphs.
The behavior likely does that.
352 – replace ‘novel’ with ‘previously unconsidered’ or ‘previously unexplored’
Figure 1 – Y-axes should be identical to facilitate comparison across panels. The font for the tick
marks on both axes should be smaller so that they can be closer to the axis lines.
Figure 2 – The pie charts are hard to read. If they are retained, then the percentages in each
wedge should be provided because there is no way for the reader to do this by eye. A stacked bar
graph would be better.
Figure 3 – It is very difficult to see the light grey text and lines. Delete the % from the tick labels
on the y-axes (redundant to the axis label). Perhaps change the fill for spiders to white so that it is
easier to distinguish from C3 herbivores.
Figure 4 – Add minor tick marks to both axes. The font for the tick marks on both axes should be
smaller so that they can be closer to the axis lines. Perhaps code blue males as black symbols for
easier distinction.
Table S1 – Add units under the variables. Capitalize morphometry measures to be consistent with
text.

The authors have done a very nice job of addressing most of the reviewers’ concerns. I still differ
with them on their ability to categorize their yellow males as satellites, and so suggest a bit of
additional toning down of wording in places. But this is a very nice study and data set overall.
My apologies for mis-characterizing the number of years of data from the Lattanzio and Miles
2014 main paper. I was referring to the data presented in Table S2 of Lattanzio and Miles 2014.
That table summarized mark-recapture for a subset of male tree lizards at the sites in 2011 and
2012; the sample size per site was 10 males total. This is the source of the sample size I referenced
in my initial review. Figure 2 of this 2014 paper presents the frequency of male morphs per site,
including only 4 orange males and 9-14 yellow males per site. Thus my concern about small
sample sizes for characterizing behavior still holds.
In Figure 3a and 3b, many yellow males do not cluster close to blue males, which is what I would
expect of satellite males. The authors in their reply to reviewers cite Hews et al. 1997, but this
paper does not address behavioral variation, rather dewlap color frequency only. In addition,
Hews et al. state that “Limited behavioral data suggest that the orange or yellow background
13
coloration does not correlate with behavioral differences”, then I do not follow how the present
authors can use this to support orange males being nomads and yellow males being satellites.
Finally, observations that are not published are difficult to evaluate. I thus still stand by my
concern that the characterization of yellow males as satellites is not supported by data in
publications from Michael Moore lab’s or published work by the authors of the current
manuscript. I thus suggest the following modifications of a few sentences.
Line 21-22 – simply delete reference to the tactics in this sentence. Difference in mating tactic are
mentioned in the previous sentence and the abstract does not allow sufficient space to fairly
characterize the morphs based on my concerns outlined above.
129 – insert ‘from many populations’ after ‘U. ornatus’
132 – insert ‘appear to’ before ‘exhibit’
419-421 – This reference cannot be used to support this statement. Also, it is not clear how a
satellite tactic would ‘minimise competition with the other morphs’ as satellites would not be
competing with nomads. I think the sentence on lines 418-419 can be removed with no loss of
emphasis on the dietary shift of the yellow males.
440 – replace ‘satellite behavioural tactic’ with ‘spatial use’.
Supplementary material – This will be published as-is, so I suggest adding authors, title and
journal at the beginning. Also, move the table and figure legends directly above or below the
relevant table or figure, respectively.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have done a very nice job of addressing most of the reviewers’ concerns. I still differ
with them on their ability to categorize their yellow males as satellites, and so suggest a bit of
additional toning down of wording in places. But this is a very nice study and data set overall.
My apologies for mis-characterizing the number of years of data from the Lattanzio and Miles
2014 main paper. I was referring to the data presented in Table S2 of Lattanzio and Miles 2014.
That table summarized mark-recapture for a subset of male tree lizards at the sites in 2011 and
2012; the sample size per site was 10 males total. This is the source of the sample size I referenced
16
in my initial review. Figure 2 of this 2014 paper presents the frequency of male morphs per site,
including only 4 orange males and 9-14 yellow males per site. Thus my concern about small
sample sizes for characterizing behavior still holds.
In Figure 3a and 3b, many yellow males do not cluster close to blue males, which is what I would
expect of satellite males. The authors in their reply to reviewers cite Hews et al. 1997, but this
paper does not address behavioral variation, rather dewlap color frequency only. In addition,
Hews et al. state that “Limited behavioral data suggest that the orange or yellow background
coloration does not correlate with behavioral differences”, then I do not follow how the present
authors can use this to support orange males being nomads and yellow males being satellites.
Finally, observations that are not published are difficult to evaluate. I thus still stand by my
concern that the characterization of yellow males as satellites is not supported by data in
publications from Michael Moore lab’s or published work by the authors of the current
manuscript. I thus suggest the following modifications of a few sentences.
Line 21-22 – simply delete reference to the tactics in this sentence. Difference in mating tactic are
mentioned in the previous sentence and the abstract does not allow sufficient space to fairly
characterize the morphs based on my concerns outlined above.
129 – insert ‘from many populations’ after ‘U. ornatus’
132 – insert ‘appear to’ before ‘exhibit’
419-421 – This reference cannot be used to support this statement. Also, it is not clear how a
satellite tactic would ‘minimise competition with the other morphs’ as satellites would not be
competing with nomads. I think the sentence on lines 418-419 can be removed with no loss of
emphasis on the dietary shift of the yellow males.
440 – replace ‘satellite behavioural tactic’ with ‘spatial use’.
Supplementary material – This will be published as-is, so I suggest adding authors, title and
journal at the beginning. Also, move the table and figure legends directly above or below the
relevant table or figure, respectively.

ar Professor Padian,
We would like to thank the three reviewers and editor for their helpful comments on our
er, and we greatly appreciate the time they put into it. We have made several changes to our
nuscript to address their concerns and to eliminate excess verbiage. As a result, we believe
revised paper is much stronger and suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science. In
sections that follow, we respond to each reviewer comment and provide details on any and all
nges we have made to our manuscript to satisfy their concerns. We provide the reviewer
ments in italics and our responses immediately follow.

e just very few minor comments and suggestions that may improve the paper. It has been a
asure reading this manuscript and I strongly recommend its publication.
ponse We thank the reviewer for the compliment. Our detailed responses are given below.
cific comments:
definition of C3 and C4 vegetation should be added at lines 73-74.
ponse. Added.
justification on the use of isotopes to test the lizard diet is needed in the introduction (for
ance, authors may relocate sentences from the Material and methods, l. 170-174).
ponse. Relocated those statements and added another to emphasize how stable isotope
hods capitalize on the C3 - C4 paradigm in plants (lines: 71-74).
t could be interesting to discuss a bit more about the relevance of head size differences
ween morphs.
ponse. Added more discussion about head shape variation among the morphs (lines: 118-125
441-450).
igure 2 could be replaced by a sentence.
ponse. Replaced (lines: 316-317).
uthors should cite and discuss the recent paper of Scali et al. (2015). Does a polymorphic
cies have a ‘polymorphic’ diet? A case study from a lacertid lizard. Biological Journal of the
nean Society.
ponse. This paper is now included in our discussion (lines: 52-55, 368-370, 392-394).
so suggest that, for future works, authors could contrast results obtained with their
hodology with results obtained with “classical” (i.e. stomach flushing, faecal samples)
hods for analysing morph diets.
ponse. The reviewer makes an excellent suggestion. MSL is preparing a paper that compares
cal sample analysis to isotopic methods for analyzing morph diets.

neral comments:
s is a well-designed study and generally well-written paper that investigated whether discrete
e reproductive phenotypes of a species of lizard also vary in diet as measured by stable
opes. This is a nice study and would make a valuable contribution to the literature except for
major flaw – the male phenotypes are described in a way that does not match the way they
e described in the paper cited to support the morphs as territorial, satellite and sneaker
ompson and Moore 1991).
ponse. We have revised the manuscript to include citations clarifying our description of
avioral differences among morphs. Specifically, laboratory and fieldwork by Michael Moore
colleagues demonstrated behavioral and territorial differences among morphs. In general,
minance status in males is conferred by the presence of blue in their throats are territorial
ompson and Moore 1991, Hews et al. 1997, Knapp et al. 2003). Orange or yellow males
ploy either a nomadic or satellite behavior. Blue morphs (either BB or OB) are dominant over
nge morphs (Hover 1985; Moore et al. 1998). There are six described dewlap color morphs in
lizards (Orange, Orange-Blue, Blue, Yellow, Yellow-Blue and Orange-Yellow). However,
OB, YB and OY morphs occur at very low frequencies at AWRR, hence we focus on the
nge, Blue, and Yellow morphs. Moore et al. (1998) considered Orange and Yellow morphs
OB and YB to be equivalent in describing the mating system of Urosaurus ornatus. Only
e males (B, YB, or OB) exhibited territorial behavior (see pg. 136 of Moore et al. [1998]) and
territories that overlapped with 3 – 4 females. In Moore et al. (1998), yellow and orange
es are suggested to have similar social phenotypes. Both morphs exhibit a satellite or
madic tactic. The type of behavior was shaped by an interaction of hormones (Androgens) and
ironmental conditions. Our field observations since 2009, coupled with experimental data on
rph aggression we report in Lattanzio & Miles (2014), support that yellow males exhibit a
marily satellite behavioral tactic and only occasionally hold territories. Thus, we feel our
criptions of male behavioural phenotypes for U. ornatus morphs in the semi-arid grassland
ulations are supported by our data.
populations studied by the authors may well have three distinct morphs with well-
umented behavioral differences, but I could not find good data to support their
egorization, either in the present manuscript or in previous published papers by the authors.
attanzio and Miles. 2014. J. Animal Ecology, the spatial use data presented come from only
males at each of 3 sites over 2 years (in total: 11 blue, 6 orange, 13 yellow). This is a very
ll data set on which to base categorization of morph behavior, especially because only 5
es at each site were collected each year and the criterion for capture away from initial
ture site was very weak (<= 3 meters from the initial capture site on a different tree or shrub
on the ground); a male’s territory could easily encompass two trees or shrubs. The weakest
ment of the morph description is describing the yellow morphs as satellites – there are no
a to support this, either in the Moore et al. 1998 paper cited by Lattanzio and Moore (2014),
n that paper itself. I have re-read both of these papers several times to verify this.
ponse. Hews et al. (1997) provided data on the geographic variation in morph frequency and
results of a common garden experiment to ascertain the genetic basis for morphs in
saurus ornatus. In this, paper they commented “Limited behavioral data suggest that the
nge or yellow background coloration does not correlate with behavioral differences” in males
ws et al. 1997, page 372); this assumption was also expressed in Moore et al. (1998).
thermore, multiple papers expressed the observation that individuals with blue throats exhibit
minant behaviors independent of the background color (e.g., B, OB, or YB). We have
stantial field observations for agonistic behavior and residency of the different morphs. Our
ervations support the characterization of yellow males as exhibiting a satellite status. In
ition, it is important to clarify that this reviewer incorrectly assessed our sample sizes used in
recent paper. Lattanzio and Miles (2014) include data from a single year, but with the
owing sample sizes per site: LB, n=28, HB, n = 29), and a third site not included in the
rent study, n=31 (see Figs. 2 or 3 of pg. 6 in our paper). Our sample sizes exceeded 10 males
5 males per year) captured per site in that dataset.
attanzio et al. 2014. PlosONE, there is a figure that clearly shows the tree male dewlap
notypes (blue, orange, yellow), with the blue being very different than the orange-blue morph
hompson and Moore 1991 and Moore et al. 1998. However, this paper provides little
avioral data to support the behavioral differences described in the present manuscript.
ponse. Lattanzio et al. (2014) focuses on mate choice behavior by female morphs, not male
rphs. Because our goal was not to characterize the variation male morphs, we presented
ited behavioral data highlighting differences among morphs. This is also why we did not
rence this particular article in our original paper.
manuscript could be saved if the authors toned down the description of the behavior of the
ee dewlap phenotypes, indicating only that in other populations dewlap color has been shown
orrelate with aggressive and territorial behavior. Assuming such corrections are made,
ecially in the final paragraph and anywhere yellow morphs are described as satellites, I also
e a few other suggestions to improve readability.
ponse We have clarified our description of the morphs to reflect this concern and the
vious two concerns as well throughout the paper.
e, line 11 and throughout – Use of the term ‘strategies’ should be replaced with ‘tactics’
ause it is not known if the three phenotypes are genetic or not.
ponse. Studies such as Moore et al. (1998) explored the hormonal contribution to male
erences in behavior and ascertain the potential genetic basis of the color morphs. Hews et al.
97) presented the results of a common garden experiment that were consistent with a genetic
is, maternal effects, or both. Latter work by Knapp et al. (2003) revealed plasticity in
llite/nomadic behavior contingent on an interaction between environmental conditions and
sma levels of testosterone/corticosterone. The evidence suggests that morphs are fixed
ugh life and have a genetic component that may be modulated by maternal effects (see also
caster et al. 2008, 2010). However, given the concerns of the reviewer, we now use the term
ic in our revision.
– Insert ‘reproductive’ before ‘behaviour’ for specificity.
ponse Done.
87 – This section was difficult to follow because it reads in places as if the lizards are feeding
the vegetation when in fact they are predators.
ponse We revised our wording to clarify that the lizards are feeding on prey derived from
hic pathways linked to those dominant vegetation types.
o, reference 20 is not tree lizard reference as implied by the wording of this sentence.
ponse Removed.
– How were the sweeps spread across the day?
ponse We clarified our wording to reflect that the four hours per day included in our original
er included ~2hrs in the mid-morning and 2hrs in the afternoon (lines: 167-173).
– Were the samples analyzed for the authors? If so, then it should be said that the samples
e sent to the analysis lab.
ponse Yes, and we have changed our wording to clarify (lines: 195-198).
– ‘facilitated’ should be ‘allowed’
ponse Changed.
-311 – I believe some references to LB and HB sites is reversed. Please reread carefully
le comparing to figure 3.
ponse Fixed.
– should mention that at the LB site non-spider predators had the opposite preference from
HB site.
ponse Added (lines: 334-335).
– I do not think you can say that habitat variation drives spatial segregation of the morphs.
behavior likely does that.
ponse As we propose in our introduction (lines: 40-43, 65-68), spatial segregation among
rphs is a function of the interaction between habitat variation and dominance/territorial
avior. Habitats with abundant resources are expected to permit high spatial overlap among
rphs regardless of behavioral differences. We consider spatial overlap to include either of
upancy of preferred microhabitat types or use of preferred prey. In contrast, we suggest
ource-poor habitats should generate spatial segregation of morphs as an outcome of
erences in behaviors linked to resource holding potential, i.e., dominance or territorial
avior. We modified our statement in the discussion to reflect that habitat variation alone does
drive segregation alone, but that it does contribute to it (360-362).
– replace ‘novel’ with ‘previously unconsidered’ or ‘previously unexplored’
ponse Replaced.
ure 1 – Y-axes should be identical to facilitate comparison across panels. The font for the tick
rks on both axes should be smaller so that they can be closer to the axis lines.
ure 2 – The pie charts are hard to read. If they are retained, then the percentages in each
ge should be provided because there is no way for the reader to do this by eye. A stacked bar
ph would be better.
ponse Removed figure 2 and replaced it with a statement in the Results (lines: 316-317).
ure 3 – It is very difficult to see the light grey text and lines. Delete the % from the tick labels
the y-axes (redundant to the axis label). Perhaps change the fill for spiders to white so that it
asier to distinguish from C3 herbivores.
ponse We have changed the tick labels to remove percent sign and changed colors as well to
more visible.
ure 4 – Add minor tick marks to both axes. The font for the tick marks on both axes should be

ier distinction.

le (Lattanzio & Miles 2014, J. Animal Ecology). The initial capture locations (presented as
referenced points) is repeatable and delineates a male’s territory or home range, and the
etation and habitat around that point reflect their resource use. We have added a statement to
methods to address this concern (lines: 143-144, 149-151, 156-158, 181-182).

r3.2. Given the d.f of the F statistics reported here and in the previous analyses for habitat
regation among sites, it seems that different samples sizes were used in the analyses of
opic variation with respect habitat structure. Indeed, in par3.1 n ~ 107 while in par3.2 n ~
r response The sample sizes differed because the actual ‘samples’ are the pooled vegetation
ues collected from each site and not the localities. In addition, the results we present are from
arate analyses: In 3.1, we have changed our analysis to only compare resource data from
ilability points (n=64) between the two sites. In 3.2, we compared isotope data from
ividual plant tissue sampled between sites (and thus not their pooled cover within the
ilability points; n=85 and n=45 individual plants at the LB and HB site, respectively). The
erences in sample size by site for plant tissues reflects their differences in vegetation
position as a consequence of differences in prescribed fire history (e.g., lines: 107-117, 136-

neral comments:
authors have done a very nice job of addressing most of the reviewers’ concerns. I still differ
h them on their ability to categorize their yellow males as satellites, and so suggest a bit of
itional toning down of wording in places. But this is a very nice study and data set overall.
r response We revised the text to address this concern (see below).
apologies for mis-characterizing the number of years of data from the Lattanzio and Miles
4 main paper. I was referring to the data presented in Table S2 of Lattanzio and Miles 2014.
t table summarized mark-recapture for a subset of male tree lizards at the sites in 2011 and
2; the sample size per site was 10 males total. This is the source of the sample size I
renced in my initial review. Figure 2 of this 2014 paper presents the frequency of male
rphs per site, including only 4 orange males and 9-14 yellow males per site. Thus my concern
ut small sample sizes for characterizing behavior still holds.
r response We thank the reviewer for this clarification. Sample sizes in our populations are
strained by the relative abundance of each morph. Even across several populations orange
es rarely exceed 10 individuals in a sample of 40-80 animals or 12-25%. These values are
ed on capture efforts at AWRR and others in southeastern Arizona). However, given the
cerns raised by the reviewer above, we toned down our wording regarding the behaviors of
h morph (see below).
Figure 3a and 3b, many yellow males do not cluster close to blue males, which is what I
uld expect of satellite males. The authors in their reply to reviewers cite Hews et al. 1997, but
paper does not address behavioral variation, rather dewlap color frequency only. In
ition, Hews et al. state that “Limited behavioral data suggest that the orange or yellow
kground coloration does not correlate with behavioral differences”, then I do not follow how
present authors can use this to support orange males being nomads and yellow males being
ellites. Finally, observations that are not published are difficult to evaluate. I thus still stand
my concern that the characterization of yellow males as satellites is not supported by data in
lications from Michael Moore lab’s or published work by the authors of the current
nuscript. I thus suggest the following modifications of a few sentences.
r response We understand the reviewer’s concerns, particularly with respect to unpublished
ervations. In response, we include two additional supplemental materials (table S1 and figure
that provide support for the satellite role of yellow morph males. First, we obtained estimates
eographic proximity (in meters) from georeferenced capture point data of male lizards
ected from the same population across two field seasons. Using generalized linear mixed-
cts models, we demonstrate that yellow morph males consistently exploit microhabitats that
significantly closer to blue males than to orange males across both years. Our findings thus
vide support for the characterization of yellow males as satellite to blue male territories, and
nomadic (which we would expect would result in no difference in proximity to either of the
er two morphs). We display the results of these models in table S1 and in figure S1. In terms
range morphs, their morph coloration (i.e., males with orange dewlap coloration lacking a
tral blue spot) and nomadic behavior (i.e., do not defend territories or escalate interactions)
been described in the past (see Thompson and Moore 1991, Animal Behavior; Thompson and
ore 1992, Hormones and Behavior). We therefore retain that characterization for orange
rph males in our population. Given our additional data on yellow males, and characterizations
m other studies of orange morph behavioral roles, we have modified our language in our
er accordingly (see below).
cific comments:
e 21-22 – simply delete reference to the tactics in this sentence. Difference in mating tactic
mentioned in the previous sentence and the abstract does not allow sufficient space to fairly
racterize the morphs based on my concerns outlined above.
r response Deleted.
– insert ‘from many populations’ after ‘U. ornatus’
r response Inserted (line 131).
– insert ‘appear to’ before ‘exhibit’
r response Inserted (line 133).
-421 – This reference cannot be used to support this statement. Also, it is not clear how a
ellite tactic would ‘minimise competition with the other morphs’ as satellites would not be
peting with nomads. I think the sentence on lines 418-419 can be removed with no loss of
phasis on the dietary shift of the yellow males.
r response In general, nomadic morphs are predicted to exploit prey types and microhabitats
ughout the potential habitat space. In our study, orange males were treated as nomadic and
eralist, whereas yellow males were considered ‘satellite’ morphs that exhibited dietary
sticity in terms of their responses to changes in resource-use pathway availability. Plasticity in
selection that leads to greater exploitation of resource pathways when they are limiting, and
s the opposite of a true generalist (which should exhibit a positive correlation between
ource use and availability), would indeed limit potential competition for food among satellite
nomadic morphs. However, because we address these dietary differences among morphs
r on in our Discussion, we have removed this statement from our revision.
– replace ‘satellite behavioural tactic’ with ‘spatial use’.
r response Our added electronic supplementary data shows that yellow morph males
sistently spatially-cluster towards blue males in a population (see table S1 and figure S1),
viding support for the characterization of yellow dewlap color as reflective of a satellite
avioral tactic towards blue males (see also Lattanzio and Miles 2014, Journal of Animal
logy). It is likely that this clustering behavior, coupled with a reduction in relative frequency
