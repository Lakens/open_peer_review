The authors described synthesis of amphiphilic pentablock copolymers, the micellar formation in
aqueous media, and study as a drug carrier. The manuscript explained well and the results
would meet the authors’ claim. To improve the quality, the reviewer asks the following points as
listed below.
1. Determination of the developed polymers should be improved.
In Fig. 3, resolution of 1H NMR was not enough. The assignments should be written in the
Experimental with recovery and yield. The spectra also should be move to the supporting
information. The authors should pay much attention to assign the peaks. For example, methylene
protons right next to the ester linkage of PEG would be also seen at 4.2 ppm. On p. 13, l. 5,
vibrations should be resonances.
No information about molecular weight was available. Degree of polymerization should be
determined from the 1H NMR, which would be compared with GPC results.
2. Micelle formation
In Fig. 5 B, the y-axis should be raw diameter. Could drastic change in scattering intensity be seen
across the CMC in DLS? The authors should describe how to measure TEM with sample
preparation in Fig. 6.
On p. 16, the authors mentioned, “It was ascribing to the few aggregations of the polymeric
micelles under alkaline conditions”. Where were the data to support this?
On Table 1, what was the definition of or how to determine PDI?
3. Mechanism of drug release
The authors explained that the decrease of cell viability was due to DOX released from the
micelle in Fig. 8, which suggested that the micelle was not up taken by the cells. One of the
advantages of this pH-sensitive micelle was faster drug release at lower pH value in a cell. Thus,
the phases “intracellular” should be revised.
In Fig. 7B, the fitting at pH 5.0 did not show linearity.
4. The manuscript should be checked by the English native speakers. Special and condition on p.
3 should be specific and conditions, respectively. Topical on p. 10 must be typical. On p. 16, not
high than but higher than. Such not appropriate words and grammatical/typographical errors
were found through the manuscript.

Some of the points were not revised. Vibrations should be resonances in NMR on p. 13.
The reviewer asked degree of polymerization (x in Fig. 2). From the GPC result, the molecular
weight was not high, and thus the x could be also determined by 1H NMR.
In Fig. 3A(upper), small peaks related to allyl protons were seen between 6.5-5.7 ppm. How was
the purity? Wasn’t it possible to confirm by elemental analysis? Why were the peaks in Fig.
3B(bottom) so broad with such a small molecular weight? FT-IR could be measured in CHCl3
(caption).
No information about GPC. Which apparatus did the authors use? What was the eluent? Or
which standard samples did they use for calculation? The 4-difit significant number is
meaningless in molecular weight. The detail should be added in the Experimental.
With Q2, the authors did not respond the change in scattering intensity across the CMC. The
reviewer asked the definition of PDI determined by DLS. Was it K2/K1^2?
Introduction of TEM experiment was far from acceptable. Detail sample preparation is required.
With Q3, the reviewer did not ask the explanation of result in Fig. 7, but did the mechanism of
cytotoxicity in Fig. 8. DOX would be gradually released from the complex as shown in Fig. 7, and
the cytotoxicity in Fig. 8 would be due to the released DOX. When the complex would be uptaken
by the cells, the trapped DOX would be released readily, leading to much larger cytotoxicity. The
authors should show the direct/solid evidence that the complex was uptaken by the cells.
Otherwise, “intracellular” should be removed.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors described synthesis of amphiphilicpentablock copolymers, the micellar
formation in aqueous media, and study as a drug carrier. The manuscript explained
well and the results would meet the authors’ claim. To improve the quality, the
reviewer asks the following points as listed below.
1. Determination of the developed polymers should be improved.
In Fig. 3, resolution of 1H NMR was not enough. The assignments should be written
in the Experimental with recovery and yield. The spectra also should be move to the
supporting information. The authors should pay much attention to assign the peaks.
For example, methylene protons right next to the ester linkage of PEG would be also
seen at 4.2 ppm. On p. 13, l. 5, vibrations should be resonances.
No information about molecular weight was available. Degree of polymerization
should be determined from the 1H NMR, which would be compared with GPC
results.
Response:
Thank you for your suggestion. The resolution of the 1H NMR is 300 dpi now, and we
also upload the single figure separately. We revised the Experimental section, and
added the yield in the end of the synthesis, “The solids were finally dried under
vacuum for 48 h to yield the acrylate-terminated PAE as a solid obtain (> 80 % yield).”
Furthermore, the peaks were re-assigned in the revised manuscript as well as more
details were added in the Results and Discussion.
The degree of the polymerization was determined from the1H NMR. Moreover,the
GPC chromatogramhas been finished to determine the molecule weight of the
copolymer. The Mw was 8475 measured by the GPC, and the number ratios of repeat
units (DSPE: PEG: PAE) was 1: 1: 0.52 determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy.
2. Micelle formation
In Fig. 5 B, the y-axis should be raw diameter. Could drastic change in scattering
intensity be seen across the CMC in DLS? The authors should describe how to
measure TEM with sample preparation in Fig. 6.
On p. 16, the authors mentioned, “It was ascribing to the few aggregations of the
polymeric micelles under alkaline conditions”. Where were the data to support this?
On Table 1, what was the definition of or how to determine PDI?
Response:
Thanks for your kind advice.In order to evaluate the serum stability of the polymeric
micelles, the change of particle size was monitored in the presence of 20 % FBS in
PBS at pH 7.4. The polymeric micelles were prepared firstly, and incubated in PBS
containing 20 % FBS, and monitored by DLS (Scientific Reports, DOI:
10.1038/srep14614). The change of hydrodynamic diameter of the polymeric micelles
indicated the serum stability. We have changed the y-axis as raw diameter in revised
manuscript as shown below.
The details about the TEM detection were added in the experiment as well as the
preparation of the samples. Thanks for your pointer.
At pH 8.0 or 9.0, the particle size was 228 nm or 240 nm which was slightly higher
than that at pH 7.4 (215 nm). This small increase could be ascribed to the aggregation
under alkaline condition, according to the reference (Polymer, 39(1998) 5171-5175,
Biomaterials, 33(2012) 6273-6283, Journal of Controlled Release, 108(2005)
140-149.Journal of the American Chemical Society, 2003, 125 (11), 3260–3267).
Thank you for your reminder for the Table1. We have added the details followed the
table. The drug loading content and entrapment efficacy were determined by the
UV-vis, and the particle size, PDI (polydispersity index) and zeta-potential were
monitored by the DLS.
3. Mechanism of drug release
The authors explained that the decrease of cell viability was due to DOX released
from the micelle in Fig. 8, which suggested that the micelle was not up taken by the
cells. One of the advantages of this pH-sensitive micelle was faster drug release at
lower pH value in a cell. Thus, the phases “intracellular” should be revised.
In Fig. 7B, the fitting at pH 5.0 did not show linearity.
Response:
Thanks. The cell viability was decreased after treatment of free DOX or DOX-loaded
polymeric micelles, indicating the cytotoxicity of the DOX molecules against tumor
cells. These drug molecules should be released from the DOX-loaded polymeric
micelles, resulting from the change of the pH values based on the pH-sensitivity of
the functional polymer. According to the pKbvalue of the polymer (pH 6.5), when the
pH was lower than 6.5, the tertiary amine residues in PAE segment was ionized that
led to the transformation of the pH-sensitive PAE from hydrophobic to hydrophilic
segments, resulting in swelling of the polymeric micelles and drug release from the
carriers. When the pH was much lower (e.g. pH 5.0, tumor intracellular), the drug
release rate should be accelerated. In summary, the drugs released extracellular or
intracellular were able to kill the tumor cells. By the way, we have modified the Fig.
7B at pH 5.0.
4. The manuscript should be checked by the English native speakers. Special and
condition on p. 3 should be specific and conditions, respectively. Topical on p. 10
must be typical. On p. 16, not high than but higher than. Such not appropriate words
and grammatical/typographical errors were found through the manuscript.
Response:
Thank you very much for your suggestion. The manuscript has been doubled checked
by an English native speaker together with us in our university. For examples, P4
L16-19 were revised as “Zhao et al. developed the mixed polymeric micelles
self-assembled from stearate-modified hyaluronic acid (SHA), mPEG-b-poly(ß-amino
ester) (mPEG-b-PAE), and ethylene acetyl-b-poly(ß-amino ester) (EA-b-PAE) which
were used for PTX targeted delivery and controlled release.” P17 L2-4 were revised
as “the tertiary amine groups of PAE segment would be ionized that led to the
transformation of the pH-sensitive PAE from hydrophobic to hydrophilic segments”.
P17 L17-20 were revised as “The particle size was about 200 nm which was smaller
than that was determined by DLS. This discrepancy could be due to shrinking of the
particles during the drying process prior to TEM analysis and an intensity average
presented by the DLS data.” P18 L4-6 were revised as “As seen from the results,
when the weight ratio of DOX to copolymer was 1:4, the LC and EE were 15.9 % and
60.4 %, respectively. As the ratio increased to 2:4, the LC was enhanced to 20.2 %
while the EE was decreased to 50.5 %.” P19 L1-3 were revised as “the in vitro DOX
release performances were evaluated in PBS solutions with pH 7.4 (normal
physiological condition) or pH 6.0 (tumoral extracellular condition) or 5.0 (tumoral
intracellular condition)”. P20 L12-14 were revised as “resulting in the full ionization
of the tertiary amine residues and the transformation of PAE segment from
hydrophobic to hydrophilic.”

Comments to the Author(s)
In this manuscript, a copolymer capable to be self-assembe into core/shell polymeric
micelles was synthesized. Due to its pH-sensitive structure change, hydrophobic
drugwas loaded for triggered releasing. This manuscript provides full characterization
of the copolymer structure, drug releasing process, and biocompatibility. It is
suggested to be published after minor revision:
1, the lower end of error in all error bars cannot be seen. Please use another color;
Response:
Thank you very much for your suggestion, and the error bars were modified in the
revised manuscript.
2, there is no detailed analysis for the size of the copolymer seen from the Fig. 6d. it
is suggested to provide a size distribution plot or provide error after "200 nm";
Response:
Thanks. We added the discussion about the results of the TEM in the revised
manuscript.
3, In Table 2, the confidence interval needs to be listed in linear regression results;
Response:
Thank you for your suggestion. In order to analyze the drug release mechanism from
the DOX-loaded polymeric micelles, the drug release data in vitro was further
analyzed by the comprehensive semi-empirical equations(as shown in the manuscript)
which were established by Ritger and Peppas reported in the previous reference.In
thepresent work, the drug release process was divided into two stages, one was from 0
to 12 h, and the other was from 12 h to 48 h. These data were obtained from the
experimental methods firstly, and then be analyzedby this reported model (Journal of
Controlled Release 5(1987), 23–26 Soft Matter, 2012, 8, 454–464, Biomaterials,
33(2012) 6273-6283, International Journal of Pharmaceutics 469 (2014) 140–145,
International Journal of Pharmaceutics 476 (2014) 253–265).Herein,these drug
releases were analyzed through the drug release models to gain insight into the drug
release mechanism and thereby improved understanding for the design of more
advanced and reliable drug delivery systems.
4, The size of the pH-sensitive PAE part could be a factor changing the drug releasing
process, it is better to know its molecular weight and probably distribution.
Response:
Thank you. The PAE segment is the pH-sensitive block in the copolymer. When the
pH decreased to weakly acidic condition, the tertiary residues were ionized, resulting
in transformation of the PAEfrom hydrophobic to hydrophilic segments. This property
was a key factor changing the drug releasing process. Therefore, the degree of the
polymerization (size of the blocks in the polymer) was determined from the1H NMR.
Moreover,the GPC chromatogramhas been finished to determine the molecule weight
of the copolymer. The Mw was 8475 measured by the GPC, and the number ratios of
repeat units (DSPE: PEG: PAE) was 1: 1: 0.52 determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy.

2. The reviewer asked degree of polymerization (x in Fig. 2). From the GPC result, the
molecular weight was not high, and thus the x could be also determined by 1H NMR.
No information about GPC. Which apparatus did the authors use? What was the
eluent? Or which standard samples did they use for calculation? The 4-difit
significant number is meaningless in molecular weight. The detail should be added in
the Experimental.
Response:
Thank you for your suggestion.According to your suggestion, we calculated the
degree of the polymerization via the result of 1H NMR. The characteristic peaks of
PEG (m) and PAE (e) in Fig. 3A were used to determine the degree of the
polymerization (x in Fig. 2), as shown below. The x value is 9, indicating the degree
of polymerization is 9.
For the GPC detection, we added the details in the Experimental 2.4. The details are
“The molecular weight (Mw) was determined by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) adopting an Agilent1200 series GPC system equipped with an LC quant pump,
PL gel 5 mm 500 Å,10,000 Å, and 100,000 Å column and RI detector. The HPLC
grade THF was used as a mobilephase with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at 30 °C.The
column system was calibratedwith a set of monodisperse polystyrene standard.” The
molecular weight was determined as 8.4750e3 g/mol.
3. In Fig. 3A(upper), small peaks related to allyl protons were seen between 6.5-5.7
ppm. How was the purity? Wasn’t it possible to confirm by elemental analysis? Why
were the peaks in Fig. 3B(bottom) so broad with such a small molecular weight?
FT-IR could be measured in CHCl3 (caption).
Response:
Thanks for your comment. In this work, to obtain the amphiphilic pentablock
copolymer which could self-assemble into polymeric micelles and respond to the
acidity of targeted sites, we first synthesized pH-sensitive poly (ß-amino esters) (PAE)
with diacrylate esters on the two terminals using Michael-type step polymerization
according to the previous reports with few modifications (Journal of Materials
Chemistry B, 2015,3, 2943; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the
United States of America, 2014, 111(34):12360-5; Biomaterials, 37 (2015), 333-344;
ActaBiomaterialia, 10 (2014) 3475–3483; Biomacromolecules, 2015, 16, 1534-1541).
And then the amine-ended PEGylated lipid (DSPE-PEG-NH2) was used to cap on the
two terminals of the PAE, resulting in the amphiphilic block
copolymerDSPE-b-PEG-b-PAE-b-PEG-b-DSPE (ActaBiomaterialia, 20 (2015) 82–93;
Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 463 (2016) 93–98; ACS Appl. Mater.
Interfaces, 2016, 8, 19284-19290). The product was purified using dialysis, and the
yield was 68 %. The chemical structure was confirmed by the 1H-NMR, as shown in
Fig. 3. We agree that small peaks related to allyl protons were seen between 6.5-5.7
ppm. We calculated the ratio of this peak 6.5-5.7 to characteristic peak of PEG (m), as
shown below: the ratio is 1: 156, suggesting the purity is 62 %.
The broad peak 3600-3100 cm-1 in Fig. 3Bwas ascribed to the OH groups in
(±)-3-amino-1,2-propanediol units of PAE segment (Journal of Encapsulation and
Adsorption Sciences, 3(2013), 65-70). Furthermore, there are two OH groups on the
pendant, leading to broader peak (Nanoscale, 2015,7, 7178-7183).
The caption of Fig. 3 was revised as “Fig. 3 1H-NMR (A) spectra of
diacrylate-terminated polymer PAE and copolymer
DSPE-b-PEG-b-PAE-b-PEG-b-DSPE in d-CDCl3, and the according FT-IR (B)
spectra.”
4. With Q2, the authors did not respond the change in scattering intensity across the
CMC. The reviewer asked the definition of PDI determined by DLS. Was it K2/K1^2?
Response:
Thanks for your comment. We check the definition of Polydispersity Index(PDI) in
DLS measurement. The Definition of PDI: a dimensionless measure of the broadness
of the size distribution calculated from the cumulants analysis. The PDI reported in
the Zetasizer software comes from the normalized second order term of the cumulant
fitting. Assuming a Gaussian distribution the relation PDI = K2/K1^2 holds.
Therefore, we agree with you.
5. Introduction of TEM experiment was far from acceptable. Detail sample
preparation is required.
Response:
Thanksyou and we added the details of TEM experiment, as follows: The morphology
of the micelles was investigated using a transmission electron microscope (TEM,
Hitachi H-7650, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, thepolymeric micelle solutions (1
mg/mL)were deposited onto copper grids coated with carbon. And the grids were kept
at atmospheric pressure and room temperature for 1-2 hfor the sticking of samples
onto the copper grid, and then the superfluous solution was absorbedby filter paper.
6. With Q3, the reviewer did not ask the explanation of result in Fig. 7, but did the
mechanism of cytotoxicity in Fig. 8. DOX would be gradually released from the
complex as shown in Fig. 7, and the cytotoxicity in Fig. 8 would be due to the
released DOX. When the complex would be uptaken by the cells, the trapped DOX
would be released readily, leading to much larger cytotoxicity. The authors should
show the direct/solid evidence that the complex was uptaken by the cells. Otherwise,
“intracellular” should be removed.
Response:
Thank you very much for your suggestion. In the last response, we explained the drug
release mechanism in Fig. 7, and hypothesized the drug release rate and cumulative
amount of drug could be enhanced when the drug-loaded system was uptaken by the
tumor cells because of the much lower pH value. We agree that the “intracellular”
should be removed in the main text. We thank the reviewer’s kindly suggestion again.
