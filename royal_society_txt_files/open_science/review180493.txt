The study is very interesting and to my knowledge, it is the first looking into these aspects in
diploid and triploid Atlantic salmon with such detail. The current study provides an additional
convincing justification for the use of triploids by the Atlantic salmon industry. It is almost
perfect as it is for publication. Nevertheless, the authors really need to improve the Discussion by
citing and making comparisons with recent literature which they might not have been aware of.
Some clarification in the M&M section is required especially with regard to the number of
individuals sampled/analysed.
I definitely recommend it for publication after minor revision.
P4 Line 9-15: it looks like there is some repetition
General comment on M&M
For any sampling and analysis carried out it would be appropriate to specify the number of
individuals/samples used as n= for each ploidy. This was done only in a few sections and not
clearly enough. Although this information is indicated in the figs/tabs this is, again, not enough.
The reader needs to understand straightaway those numbers as indicating the reliability of
measurements and statistics. A table in M&M with sampling/analysis type and number of
individuals used per year/ploidy/sex/replicate is probably an effective way to make some
clarity.
P8 Line 48-49: font size of numbers seems discontinuous
P9 Line 25: please explain "se", I assume it means standard error. This needs to be made clear in
the statistics section as: "data are reported as mean+/-standard deviation (SD) and/or standard
error (SE)". This was done in the graphs but not in the aforementioned section.
P11 Section 4.1 The authors refer to quite old literature only. There has been a massive production
of studies on comparisons between triploid and diploid salmon. The authors might want to have
a look and cite the recent literature from Taylor, Fraser and Sambraus just to mention a few
authors.
P11 Line 57: in vitro or in vivo?
P12 Line 12: GSI 52% smaller? larger? please clarify
P12 Line 16: be consistent and use either spermatozoa or sperms (plural) in the section
P13 Line 42-43: the literature is not scarce at all. The authors seem not to be aware of the literature
produced in the last few years on triploids. Please read and consider to compare your results
with and cite:

Dear authors
This research is scientifically sound and well-designed, and also timely in light of the issues with
farmed salmon escapees entering freshwater and interbreeding with native fish, and the
associated severe negative effects on genetic diversity and fitness of wild populations.
This research represents a detailed investigation comparing the reproductive function of triploid
and diploid farm Atlantic salmon including: primary reproductive development and maturity,
along with sperm function and the associated fertility outcomes. This detailed analyses of
reproductive function provides new knowledge about sperm function and the associated
reproductive consequences, providing a meaningful contribution to the literature.
Additionally, fillet quality analyses was also investigated, which is also timely given the concerns
with poor nutritional fillet quality of farmed Atlantic salmon compared to wild fish, and the
nutritional importance of Omega-3 PUFA in human diet that salmon provide. Triploid muscle
tissue had reduced levels of fatty acids and was not associated with an increase in fillet quality,
But an interesting result in regards to the fact that triploid fish are able to accumulate higher
amounts of EAP ad DHA, and as you have stated there may be some avenue here for nutritional
improvement.
The in-field methods you have used to address the main research questions of this project have
been well executed, and I have very few comments to make.
4
This is a well-written manuscript, clear and concise. I have just a few comments in relation to
citation errors associated with the statistical package you have used (see comments below). I
guess if I had one comment to make if would have been nice to have had a larger sample size (n =
10) for comparing sperm traits between diploid and triploid fish, whereas you were able to use n
= 15 to examine fillet quality.

The study is very interesting and to my knowledge, it is the first looking into these

provides an additional convincing justification for the use of triploids by the
Atlantic salmon industry. It is almost perfect as it is for publication. Nevertheless,
the authors really need to improve the Discussion by citing and making
comparisons with recent literature which they might not have been aware of.
Some clarification in the M&M section is required especially with regard to the
number of individuals sampled/analysed.
I definitely recommend it for publication after minor revision.
Authors response: Sincere thanks for the positive feedback, thorough
reviewing, and suggestions for improvement which we have now incorporated
(see specific comments below).
P4 Line 9-15: it looks like there is some repetition
Authors response: We have reduced the repetition by altering the final
paragraph on Page 4.
General comment on M&M
For any sampling and analysis carried out it would be appropriate to specify the
number of individuals/samples used as n= for each ploidy. This was done only in
a few sections and not clearly enough. Although this information is indicated in
the figs/tabs this is, again, not enough. The reader needs to understand
straightaway those numbers as indicating the reliability of measurements and
statistics. A table in M&M with sampling/analysis type and number of individuals
used per year/ploidy/sex/replicate is probably an effective way to make some
clarity.
Authors response: We have now included a clear description at the start of the
methods (section 2.1) describing sample size details. We have also added the
specific sample sizes for the lipid extraction and fatty acid analyses (section 2.8).
The specific number of samples has also been clearly described in other sections
of this manuscript, including the methods and materials (implicitly stated in the
first sentence of each paragraph where appropriate), in the results sections (in
both the degrees of freedom of each statistical analysis and stated within the
captions of figures and tables). Given these descriptions of sample sizes through
the manuscript and our new additions we believe it is unnecessary to include a
further table into the manuscript.
P8 Line 48-49: font size of numbers seems discontinuous
Authors response: We have found incorrect fonts of numbers on page 9 line
48-49. These have now been corrected to fit with the font of all numbers within
the manuscript.
P9 Line 25: please explain "se", I assume it means standard error. This needs to
be made clear in the statistics section as: "data are reported as mean+/-standard
deviation (SD) and/or standard error (SE)". This was done in the graphs but not
in the aforementioned section.
Authors response: We have now stated that the data reported within brackets
are mean ± standard error within section 2.9 Data analysis. We have also
corrected “se” to “standard error” in section 3.1 body condition.
P11 Section 4.1 The authors refer to quite old literature only. There has been a
massive production of studies on comparisons between triploid and diploid
salmon. The authors might want to have a look and cite the recent literature from
Taylor, Fraser and Sambraus just to mention a few authors.
Authors response: We have now added studies by Taylor et al., 2014, Fraser et
al., 2018 and Sambraus et al., 2018 to Discussion Section 4.1 Growth, size and
condition..
P11 Line 57: in vitro or in vivo?
Authors response: We agree there is an ambiguity because natural fertilisation
takes place externally. However, we believe the term “in vitro” is more
appropriate here as the fertilisation and development took place outside the
normal biological environment for salmon spawning, and under strict aquaculture
hatchery conditions.
P12 Line 12: GSI 52% smaller? larger? please clarify
Authors response: We have clarified our statement to ‘triploid Atlantic salmon
had a GSI 52% less than that of diploids”.
P12 Line 16: be consistent and use either spermatozoa or sperms (plural) in the
section
Authors response: To increase the consistency of the paragraph we have
changed “spermatozoa” to sperm.
P13 Line 42-43: the literature is not scarce at all. The authors seem not to be
aware of the literature produced in the last few years on triploids. Please read
and consider to compare your results with and cite:
Triploid Atlantic salmon shows similar performance, fatty acid composition and
proteome response to diploids during early freshwater rearing. doi:

chemical composition from Manor 2012, 2014, 2015
There might also be some useful information (chemical composition/flesh quality)
in the literature mentioned above for section 4.1
Authors response: We agree with the reviewer that more updated references
are available, but were focusing on lipid content in muscle tissue of Atlantic
salmon. As suggested, we have now added studies by Burke et al.,2010, Nuez-
Ortiz et al.,2017, Tibbetts et al., 2013, Clarkson et al., 2017. However, these
studies have focused on whole-body lipid content and not specifically the human
consumed muscle tissues, which from a human nutritional perspective is the only
nutritional value that matters. Therefore, we have highlighted the scarcity of this
information, but also made it clearer that it is the lipid content of the muscle
tissue specifically from triploid Atlantic salmon that is scarce and not lipid data in
general.

between diploid and triploid fish, whereas you were able to use n = 15 to
examine fillet quality.
Authors response: Sincere thanks for the positive comments, detailed review,
and suggestions for improvement which we have incorporated (see below).
Comments to the authors.
Methods
Sperm collection and analyses
Page 6
In relation to CASA date acquired for each fish, were replicate values obtained
for each fish, and was the repeatability the same for each CASA recording? If so
please mention in the methods.
Authors response: We have made it clear that the sperm from each male was
analysed in duplicate. We used Pearsons correlation analysis to show a
significant relationship between the first and second recordings for CASA
analysis. This information has now been added to sections 2.5. Sperm collection
and analyses and 2.9. Data analysis.
Egg development
Page 7
It might be useful to the reader if you could put in the average time post
fertilisation the eggs eyed.
Authors response: We now state that eyed eggs were collected ‘…an average
of 3 months following fertilisation’. We did not record the exact date when eggs
became eyed as development into the eyed stage is a continuous process,
preventing the collection of discrete timeline data.
Data analysis
Line 41. Need to correctly cite R statistical package (version used) rather then
the R studio
Authors response: Apologies. We have added the correct version of the R
statistical package used (R version 3.4.0) and made the appropriate citation. R
Core Team (2017). R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL https://www.R-
project.org/
Line 42. Also need cite ggplot2 correctly. In R you can use the function <-citation
("ggplot2"), to get the correct citation for whatever r package you use.
Authors response: We have also added the correct citation for ggplot 2 “H.
Wickham. ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis. Springer-Verlag New
York, 2009”.
Did you use the Lm R package for fitting your statistical linear models? If so
please cite and insert the reference in your paper.
Authors response: We used the core R package to fit statistical models and
have also added the appropriate citation to section 2.9 data analysis. “R Core
Team (2017). R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL https://www.R-
project.org/”
Also please cite and reference the R programme used to do the principle
component analyses.
Authors response: We used the core R package to compute the principle
components analysis and have now also added the appropriate citation to
section 2.9 data analysis. “R Core Team (2017). R: A language and environment
for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.
