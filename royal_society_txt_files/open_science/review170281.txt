Entitled
Population patterns in World’s administrative units
By Fontanelli et al.
To Authors
1. Although I propose a publication of the paper, I am sure that readers would be unsatisfied
with the English at various places of this original version. Thus some polishing of the text is
recommended.
Would examples be needed? Let us start with the abstract:
1st sentence: “While there has been an extended discussion concerning city population
distribution, little has been said about those of administrative divisions.” My comment: “an
extended discussion” .. why “an”? why not “some”?; and “about those of”… “those” ? awkward
since there is nothing which is a plural in the sentence; most likely it was “distributionS”
last sentence: “This model along with the fitting of DGBD function prove adequate”; my
comment: most likely it should be “proves”
2. Why do you not mention in the introduction, text, and conclusion sections, published work by
Ausloos and Cerqueti on the aspects you consider? The authors studied demographic and
economic “size distributions” not only of cities, but also of provinces and regions in Italy, - as
well as selected (or filtered) set of cities, through several papers, in fact using, discussing, and
interpreting the DGBD function (parameters) for fits. In such papers there is also some time
dependence due to city merging, province creation, etc.
It is regrettable that “seldom” is unsubstantiated, on line 17, p.13. If it is “seldom”, then a few
references are pertinent and will not increase much the size of the paper.
3. In such papers, deviations from DGBD are also discussed through “king”, “vice-roy”, “harem”
effects, because a two parameter function is rather stringent. Outliers are often quite interesting
and could be usefully emphasized, - and discussed. It can be noticed that you do not like outliers
(your discussion on only the 128 largest Chinese cities).
4. In this line of considerations, it is unclear what filtering was used in order to eliminate
(undesirable) prefectures before fits, p.12, line 37.
5. In fact, why should the distribution(s) be symmetric (connecting with statements, p.11 line 15).
Moreover, contrary to many incorrect thinkers and thoughts, a third parameter does not
necessarily makes better fits; yet, since the parameter space is enlarged the number of “best fits”
better depends on the initial conditions used in the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; the
nonlinearity or complexity is increased and the discussion of the results might even be more
elaborate.
6. p.6, line 9 : The quality and reliability of the data could be checked through Benford’s law.
7. p.10, split-merge model: that reminds me of a paper in Entropy (2015) where there is a
discussion and analysis of the various (dis)orders and subsequent measures of the (planned or
effective) re-organisation of regions in modern France; it could be compared with your work on
Georgia, p.11, line 53 and following ones.
3
8. Notice that the two classical hypotheses about the population size in systems of cities
(Hypothesis 1 being Gibrat's and Zipf's theory ; Hypothesis 2 pertaining to the so-called Yule
process) were (well discussed by Vitanov and Ausloos in a J Appl. Stat. paper in 2015. See also
Schaffar and Dimou in Regional Studies, (2012).
9. Recommendation : please check the content of the bibliography; be careful when a copy-paste
process is used; see (for example) ref. 40 ! and watch out for capital letters

label_comment_2
I enjoyed reading the manuscript "Population patterns in World’s administrative units" by
Fontanelli and coauthors. Here they present an extensive analysis of the population distribution
of administrative units from 150 countries. Their main result is to propose and verify that a two-
parameter distribution (the discrete generalized beta distribution - DGBD) fits very nice most of
the data. They also have a discussion on how the parameters of this distribution can be
interpreted as a distance to the special distributions: uniform, delta, and Lavalette (that resembles
a log-normal). Finally, a split-merge model is proposed as a "toy model" for mimicking some
aspects of the population distribution.
To the best of my knowledge, all these results are new. And they are very interesting in my
opinion. Thus, I consider this paper is very good fit for RSOS. I will be happy to recommend its
publication after the authors account for a few points listed below.
1) About the statement around lines 28-34 of page 2. The authors are mentioning the urban
scaling hypothesis. There has been much interest in this topic, and I think the results presented in
this manuscript are also of interest for the community working on this issue. So, I think the
authors could explicitly mention this fact on their manuscript and also other works on this
subject.
4
2) The authors mention (around lines 9-20 of page 6) that there exist some discrepancies between
the data provided by Statoids and the official census, at least for the Mexico case. According to
the authors, this leads to small variations in the DGBD parameters. I think the authors could
provide more details about this discrepancies. For instance, how many administrative units have
different populations? How large is this difference? I never heard about Statoids before this
paper. Are the authors sure this is a reliable source of information?
3) I have some doubt about the "KS statistic" employed by the authors. From my understanding
what the authors are calculating is not exactly the KS statistic. Because this quantity is defined as
the largest distance between an empirical cumulative distribution and a particular cumulative
distribution, and since the rank is proportional to the CDF, the statistic calculated by the authors
is also proportional to the KS statistic. And that is why the authors are not using the Kolmogorov
distribution for estimating their p-values. I think this issue could be commented in the
manuscript.
4) I found the description of the fitting procedure a bit confusing. From my understanding, the
authors are using a nonlinear regression whose initial parameters are obtained by fitting a linear
regression to the log-transformed data via the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (that is usually
used to solve non-linear least squares problems). What is the algorithm used for the nonlinear
regression? Is it really necessary to choose the initial parameters in this way?
5) Is figure 7 a supplementary figure? This figure is mentioned in page 7, just after figure 2 and
before all others.
6) I think the authors could move the country labels in figure 3. This will make the reading much
easier. I think just a shift will help, but a more professional solution is available, for instance, in R
(ggrepl - https://github.com/slowkow/ggrepel) or Python (adjustText -
https://github.com/Phlya/adjustText).
7) I'm a bit concerned about the values of a<0. Since they cannot represent a rank, why the
authors don't add the constraint a>0 during the fitting procedure?
8) At line 8 or 9 of page 9, I think the correct countries are Burundi and Papua New Guinea (not
Nigeria). Also, it would be useful to mention the ISO3 codes for all extreme cases listed around
this sentence.
9) When describing the model, around lines 30-50, I guess would be very helpful to illustrate the
model by means of some diagram.
10) I also think the discussion of the model is in a lower level when compared with the data
analysis of the authors. Perhaps because I was expecting more from the abstract and introduction.
Because of that, and mainly because the comparison with model results are only qualitative, I
suggest the authors tone a bit down the presentation of the model at the beginning of the
manuscript, perhaps by saying that it is just a "toy model."
11) From the results of figure 4E (which BTW is cited as D), there seems to have a lot of cases with
a<0. As mentioned by the authors, within this region the DGBD cannot represent a rank. Also, it
appears that (under the conditions investigated) the model produces practically always b<a,
which does not happen for the empirical data. The authors could comment on this issue too.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
I have read with pleasure this work. The present work considers a thorough statistical analysis of
the rank-size dependency for primary (PAU) and secondary administrative units (SAU). The
authors propose the Discrete Generalized Beta Distribution (DGBD) as an alternative for the
power-law for fitting the rank-size dependency curves for SAUs for many countries and
geographic regions. One of their main finding is that the characteristic rank-size dependency for
SAUs can be well modeled assuming a simple split-merge dynamics for the dynamics of the size
for the administrative units. To the best of my knowledge the findings are novel, the statistical
analysis is attempted in a rigorous manner and the results complements in a nice way the known
scaling relations for the distribution of large cities after their sizes. All these aspects would
recommend publication of the present work, however I found some issues that has to be
answered or clarified before the manuscript is accepted for publication. My main concerns are the
followings:
1. The rank-size dependency indeed has a connection with the cumulative distribution
function (density function), as it is specified in equation 2.1. For this aspects I do have several
suggestions:
- for a general audience it is however misleading the statement: “We define the rank of
$x_{[[i]}, denoted by…..”. This would imply that the rank-size dependencies were constructed
according to 2.1, which is of course not true. In real data one just order the elements according to
their size and plot the size as a function of the order. Also, it is not rigorously shown that the
experimentally constructed rank-size dependency curves are really the same as the rank defined
by 2.1.
- the rank-size (rank-population) dependency curves are connected to the real cumulative
and density functions by an inverse function. For a power-law is clear that the inverse function is
also a power-law, in such manner the power-law nature of the rank-size dependency curves
implies a power-law for the density and cumulative distribution functions as well. Unfortunately
for the DGBD this is not true, the fact the rank-size dependency is well fitted by a DGBD does
not suggest an explicit form for the density function. In such sense the claims that are written
many times (and also in the abstract) that “DGBD is better than a power-law for fitting country
population data” has to be reformulated with care, not to be misleading for the density function.
2. My main concern is for the used model. Usually it is OK to use a low-dimensional
approximation (1D model) to get the main features of a physical phenomena in case one would
6
justify its use by the possibility to get some analytical approximations or an exact result. The one-
dimensional split-merge model is studied here only by Monte Carlo simulations. I do not see thus
the point to get a 1D approximation and why not consider the realistic 2D situation which could
be also easily studied by MC simulations. One could consider a random 2D lattice in a plane and
make the same type of MC simulations. In such manner the model would be more realistic and
would lead to more relevant results. The advantage of a 1D model would be an analytic formula,
which I do not see here. In the same line, also in the 1D model what is the reason for selecting the
TWO largest regions for split and unite one randomly selected region with it’s two neighbors. I
do understand that the authors want to keep constant the number of administrative unit, but this
can be done in a simpler manner: choose the largest one for split and choose one AU and one of
it’s neighbor for merging. If there is some specific reason for working as it is described in the
manuscript the authors must specify it.
3. From the computer simulation results of the split-merge model we learn that the final “a”
and “b” parameters are giving mostly “a\approx 0” (Figure 5) . This is somewhat different from
what we have learned from the experimental results presented in Figure 3., where the most
probable “a” value is around 0.5.
Maybee some comments would be in order here.
4. Despite the convincing statistical analysis given in the manuscript, the claim that the DGBD is
a better fit than a power-law is also a little misleading. DGBD is basically a two-parameter fit
(containing as a special case the power-law as well) while the power-law is only one-parameter
fit. In this sense it is obvious that with two parameters one gets a better fit. Maybe instead of
power-law one should use the Pareto distribution which is a two-parameter model, and compare
the results like that. The Pareto distribution has the real power-law tail, so it represents the real
power-law distributions. Comparing a two-parameter fit with a one-parameter one is risky in
such sense. The authors should comment on this aspect.
5. Labels on the figures are way to small for reading them in a printed version …and even after
magnification of the PDF on a monitor screen. I was only guessing what is written there.
In conclusion, I would recommend publication of this work after the authors comment or
consider the above concerns.

10

provide more details about this discrepancies. For instance, how many administrative units have
different populations? How large is this difference? I never heard about Statoids before this

fit. In this sense it is obvious that with two parameters one gets a better fit. Maybe instead of
power-law one should use the Pareto distribution which is a two-parameter model, and compare
the results like that. The Pareto distribution has the real power-law tail, so it represents the real
power-law distributions. Comparing a two-parameter fit with a one-parameter one is risky in
such sense. The authors should comment on this aspect.

In conclusion, I would recommend publication of this work after the authors comment or

authors mention (around lines 9-20 of page 6) that there exist some discrepancies between the
rovided by Statoids and the official census, at least for the Mexico case. According to the

about this discrepancies. For instance, how many administrative units have different

are about the risk of using Statoids in future work because, as far as we know, it has not been

ve some doubt about the "KS statistic" employed by the authors. From my understanding what
hors are calculating is not exactly the KS statistic. Because this quantity is defined as the largest
ce between an empirical cumulative distribution and a particular cumulative distribution, and
he rank is proportional to the CDF, the statistic calculated by the authors is also proportional to
statistic. And that is why the authors are not using the Kolmogorov distribution for estimating
-values. I think this issue could be commented in the manuscript.

noticeable, but see for example Fig. 4 A).

lso think the discussion of the model is in a lower level when compared with the data analysis of
thors. Perhaps because I was expecting more from the abstract and introduction. Because of
nd mainly because the comparison with model results are only qualitative, I suggest the authors
bit down the presentation of the model at the beginning of the manuscript, perhaps by saying
is just a "toy model."
viewer is right. Actually this point was also raised by another reviewer. In order to make the
more realistic, we have designed and implemented a 2D version of the model. The results are
ally the same (Fig.7 and last paragraph of page 15). In the new version of the manuscript we
n several times that this is only a toy model (see the abstract for instance), intended only to
te two general features of the process: the merging and splitting of administrative units.
om the results of figure 4E (which BTW is cited as D), there seems to have a lot of cases with
s mentioned by the authors, within this region the DGBD cannot represent a rank. Also, it
rs that (under the conditions investigated) the model produces practically always b<a, which

rst concern was addressed in point 7). The reviewer is right in pointing out that this cannot
ent rank and we have corrected this. Regarding the second concern, we speculate that countries
the a=b line are still in the process of breaking their initial power law or lognormal distribution.
other hand, the number of updates of administrative units is limited by each country's history,
is some times quite short. In this respect, the DGBD becomes relevant as a transient distribution

sion on this regard.

rank-size dependency indeed has a connection with the cumulative distribution function (density
n), as it is specified in equation 2.1. For this aspects I do have several suggestions:
general audience it is however misleading the statement: “We define the rank of $x_{[[i]},
d by…..”. This would imply that the rank-size dependencies were constructed according to 2.1,
is of course not true. In real data one just order the elements according to their size and plot the
a function of the order. Also, it is not rigorously shown that the experimentally constructed
ize dependency curves are really the same as the rank defined by 2.1.
nk-size (rank-population) dependency curves are connected to the real cumulative and density
ns by an inverse function. For a power-law is clear that the inverse function is also a power-
such manner the power-law nature of the rank-size dependency curves implies a power-law for
nsity and cumulative distribution functions as well. Unfortunately for the DGBD this is not true,
t the rank-size dependency is well fitted by a DGBD does not suggest an explicit form for the
function. In such sense the claims that are written many times (and also in the abstract) that
D is better than a power-law for fitting country population data” has to be reformulated with
ot to be misleading for the density function.
viewer is right in all these observations and section The rank-size representation and the DGBD
n was rewritten almost entirely. In the new version we define the rank statistic of a random
by means of the order statistic and use this to propose a definition of a rank-size representation.

n by using Eq. 2.1 and comment how a rank-size plot approximates the rank function in a
way in which a histogram approximates the pdf. We also comment how the pdf and the rank-
nction of a power law or a Pareto distribution are both inverse powers, but that the inversion

main concern is for the used model. Usually it is OK to use a low-dimensional approximation
odel) to get the main features of a physical phenomena in case one would justify its use by the
ility to get some analytical approximations or an exact result. The one-dimensional split-merge
is studied here only by Monte Carlo simulations. I do not see thus the point to get a 1D
imation and why not consider the realistic 2D situation which could be also easily studied by
mulations. One could consider a random 2D lattice in a plane and make the same type of MC
tions. In such manner the model would be more realistic and would lead to more relevant
. The advantage of a 1D model would be an analytic formula, which I do not see here. In the
ine, also in the 1D model what is the reason for selecting the TWO largest regions for split and
ne randomly selected region with it’s two neighbors. I do understand that the authors want to
onstant the number of administrative unit, but this can be done in a simpler manner: choose the
one for split and choose one AU and one of it’s neighbor for merging. If there is some specific
for working as it is described in the manuscript the authors must specify it.
nk that everybody would agree that in this context a 2D model would be more realistic that the
ponding 1D. Nonetheless there are a number of examples in Science where a 1D model gives the
of the phenomenon and a 2D does not increase significantly our knowledge (think about solitons
tion-diffusion equations). However it is not our intention to get engaged in a discussion about
ue, so we have accepted the reviewer's suggestion and consequently designed and implemented
odel. We have added to the manuscript the results of a number of 2D simulations.
mark of the reviewer opens a new line of research that we intend to pursue in a future work. It is
le in fact to imagine that the 2D model might lead to rich spatio-temporal patterns but this
ility exists so far only in our plans.
m the computer simulation results of the split-merge model we learn that the final “a” and “b”
eters are giving mostly “a\approx 0” (Figure 5). This is somewhat different from what we have
d from the experimental results presented in Figure 3., where the most probable “a” value is
0.5. Maybe some comments would be in order here.
oncern was also raised by anther reviewer. We speculate that the splitting and merging of units
an initial lognormal or power law population distribution, leading to different population
utions which are well represented by the DGBD; this is consistent with the data. The main thing
erve is that the particular history of a country or territory limits the number of updates in its
strative unit system (the steps of the split-merge process); thus, we expect that the transient
in the dynamics of the model might be more relevant than the time going to infinity limiting
We added some lines of discussion about this

viewer is right in pointing out the risk of comparing the fits of distributions with different
r of parameters. What we actually test is the balance between the goodness of fit and the number
ameters between power law and DGBD; this is what the Akaike Information Criterion allows. We
wledge that claims like “DGBD has a better goodness of fit than power law” are misleading
e of this, but we have toned them down all along the new version of the manuscript, specifying
