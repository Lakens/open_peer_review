The paper presented nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to evaluate the pore structure
characteristics of high-rank coal. By comparing two classic permeability models, the authors
proposed a permeability model to calculate the permeability of anthracite. From a general point
of view, the work is respectable. But there are some problems in this article:
1. The literature review in Introduction is inadequate. It is well known that many researchers
3
have conducted the NMR testing on coal, including high-rank coal. The authors should mention
how their effort/findings differ from other studies.
2. In Line 300 “Most of the pores in anthracite are adsorption pores with a strong adsorption
capacity and high gas content”, there is insufficient evidence for this conclusion. How can you
know “the pores” have “a strong adsorption capacity and high gas content”?
3. I recommend to correct the incorrect words and sentences in manuscript.

The manuscript by Zhang and co-authors studied the characteristics of pore structure of high-
rank coal using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The porosity, T2 cutoff value, permeability,
and pore type were analyzed using the transverse relaxation time (T2) spectrum before and after
centrifugation. The low-field NMR T2 spectrum was converted into the NMR total porosity, the
residual porosity and the effective porosity. The authors pointed out that three T2 spectrum
peaks were identified at the relaxation times which correspond to the micropores, mesopores and
macropores. The authors divided the T2 spectrum into two parts (bound fluid and free fluid)
based on the T2 cutoff value. And the authors proposed a permeability model based on the NMR
porosity, the free fluid index and the bound fluid index.
Also, the authors used equation 2 to calculate the correspondence between T2 relaxation time and
pore size. However, the data and process was lack in the manuscript. The authors used BVI and
FFI to calculate the residual porosity and effective porosity, however, there was no equation to
calculate BVI and FFI, only explain how they can be obtained in the manuscript.
In the test, Zhang and co-authors studied the characteristics of pore structure of high-rank coal,
so I suggest that the authors put the vitrinite reflectance of samples on the manuscript.
There are some writing and grammatical issues and mistakes in the manuscript. The writing issue
4
needs to be addressed with great care and detail:
Line 123: The equation 2 was opposite to the description from line 127 to line 129.The positive
correlation existed between T2 and S / V value in equation 2, however, the authors indicated
negative correlation in the description which was opposite to the front.
Line 215: There was mistake in this sentence. It may be “while the other fraction corresponds to
the free fluid”.
Line 233: I think “The main reason for these differences is that the T2cutoff is not only affected by
the lithology but also related to pore throat, particle size, texture and measurement parameters.”
would be better.
Table 1: The authors wanted to present the proximate analysis of coal samples in table 1,
however, it didn’t indicate whether these samples are proximate or not.

Pore structure characteristics of high-rank coal was studied by NMR method using six anthracite
samples from the Baijiao coal reservoir. And the experimental process and research methods are
described in detail in the article. However, authors just studied the porosity, permeability and
pore size types, in fact, pore structure characteristics should be included pore size, pore surface,
pore volume, pore shape, pore types and so on. So it would be better if the title of the article was
changed. In addition, there are other problems in the article:
(1)In the Introduction part: Page 2-3, Line 42-44. Coal pores size types have been divided by
many researchers, authors should elaborate on that. Micropore(<2 nm), mesopore(2-50nm), and
macropore(>50 nm) are the most common classification criteria, especially for coal pores.
(2)In the Introduction part: Page 3, Line 44-46. CBM exists in the coal seam primarily in two
states? Some papers have demonstrated that not two states. In addition, “Adsorbed gas is
primarily stored in the micropores and transition pores, while free gas is preserved in the
mesopores and macropores” should be added some references. In fact, adsorbed or free gas type
5
in micro-pores is different, authors should explain them in this part.
(3)Adsorbed pore and adsorption pore should be unified.
(4)Page 7, Line 135-137 should be added the related references. and explain detaily why “less
than 1.7 ms corresponds to the micropores (pores with diameters smaller than 10 nm) and 137
transition pores (pore with diameter in the range 10-100 nm) in coal”.

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning
our manuscript entitled “Characteristics of pore structure of high-rank
coal by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR): A case study of the Baijiao
coal reservoir, SW China” (Manuscript ID: RSOS-181411). Those
comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising and improving
our paper, as well as the important guiding significance to our
researches. We have studied comments carefully and have made
correction which we hope meet with approval. Revised portion are
highlighted in in the article. The main corrections in the paper and the
responds to the reviewer’s comments are as flowing:
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer #1:
Q1: References are needed for the equations, and Please check whether
the equation (2) is correct.
Answer 1: We are very sorry for our negligence of the equation, we have
1
changed the equation 2 T2 =<U+F072>2 <U+F028> S / V <U+F029> to =<U+F072>2 <U+F028> S / V <U+F029> .
T2
Q2: Why the centrifuge pressure is set as 200 Psi in your test procedure?
Answer 2: According to the reference 21, the centrifuge pressure and
centrifugal pore radius according to the Washburn equation:
<U+F02D>2<U+F073> cos <U+F071>
rc <U+F03D>
Pc
Where the Pc is the mercury pressure, rc is the Minimum pore radius
under the mercury pressure, <U+F073> is the surface tension, 0.076N/m. <U+F071> is
the Contact angle between water and coal surface, 60°. The pore radius
is 0.1 µm under the 200 Psi , which the boundary between the
percolation pore and the adsorption pore .Therefore, the centrifuge
pressure is 200 Psi.
Q3: The mesopores, macropores and microfractures (the second and the
third peaks in the T2 spectrum), termed seepage holes, were the main
conduits to gas diffusion and permeation in the coal seam”. Please make
further explanation on the aforementioned phrase.
Answer 3: The second and third peaks in the T2 spectrum of coal sample
correspond to the pore diameter of less than 100 nm, according the
classification of pore diameter in this paper, the pore with diameter
small than 100 nm belong to the seepage holes, the CBM penetrates in
the mesopores, macropores, and fractures mainly by laminar or seepage.
Therefore, the seepage holes mainly affect the desorption, diffusion and
seepage of coalbed methane.
Q4: The phrase “The accurate calculation of the T2cutoff value is key to
distinguishing free fluid and bound fluid as well as the porosity,
permeability and pore size distribution; this helps to apply NMR in the
evaluation of coal reservoirs” conveys the intended sense.
Answer 4: Yes, it conveys the intended sense.
Q5: Why the T2cutoff values of coal samples have a big difference in
Table 2.
Answer 5: The coal was composed with crystal, pore, joint, microfissure,
cement, clay and different mineral grain. Therefore, coal samples have
strong heterogeneity, the T2cutoff values of coal samples have a big
difference.
We appreciate for your valuable comments and hope that the correction
will meet with approval.
Reviewer #2:
Q1: The literature review in Introduction is inadequate.
Answer 1: Thank you for valuable comments. We have revised it in the
article.
Q2:“Most of the pores in anthracite are adsorption pores with a strong
adsorption capacity and high gas content”, there is insufficient evidence
for this conclusion. How can you know “the pores” have “a strong
adsorption capacity and high gas content”?
Answer 2: Thank you for valuable comments. As the sentence is
ambiguous, we have deleted this sentence in the article.
Q3: I recommend to correct the incorrect words and sentences in
manuscript.
Answer 3: We are very sorry for our incorrect writing and make
correction according to the Reviewer’s comments.
Special thanks to you for your good comments
Reviewer #3:
Q1: The data and process of T2 relaxation time and pore size were lack
in the manuscript.
Answer 1: Special thanks to you for your comments. According to the
NMR experiment results and equation 2, it can be obtained a pore
distribution radius curve in the NMR experiment report, this pore
distribution radius corresponds to the T2 spectrum of coal sample. By
processing the pore radius distribution curve, as shown in figure, we can
get the T2 spectrum peak at less than 1.7 ms corresponds to the
micropores (pores with diameters smaller than 10 nm) and transition
pores (pore with diameter in the range 10-100 nm) in coal. The
micropores peak of T2 spectrum has no significant change before and
after centrifugation, which indicates that the connectivity of micropores
and transition pores is poor. The residual water which bound in the
micropores and transition pores cannot be drained by the centrifugation.
Since pore distribution radius of coal sample can be judged by the T2
spectrum at water-saturated and irreducible water condition, therefore,
the pore distribution radius curve is not shown in the article.

Q2: There was no equation to calculate BVI and FFI.
Answer 2: Thank you for your valuable comments, we have explained
in the article. As shown in figure 4, We accumulate the two T2 spectra
under water-saturated and irreducible water condition to obtain the
cumulative porosity curve, the BVI and FFI can be obtained directly
according to the cumulative porosity curve, therefore, there is no direct
equation to calculate BVI and FFI.
Q3: The vitrinite reflectance of samples.
Answer 3: Thank you for your valuable comments. We have added the
vitrinite reflectance of coal samples in the Table 1.
Q4: The equation 2 was opposite to the description from line 127 to line
129.The positive correlation existed between T2 and S / V value in
equation 2.
Answer 4: We are very sorry for our negligence of the equation, we have
1
changed the equation 2 T2 =<U+F072>2 <U+F028> S / V <U+F029> to =<U+F072>2 <U+F028> S / V <U+F029> .

Q5: There was mistake in sentence.
Answer 5: We are very sorry for our incorrect writing, “while the other
fraction corresponds to the bound fluid” has been modified to “while the
other fraction corresponds to the free fluid”.
Q6: There is some problem with sentence in the line 233.
Answer 6: Thank you for your suggestion, as suggested that by the
reviewer, we have modified “The main reason for these differences is
because the T2cutoff is not only affected by the lithology but is also related
to pore throat, particle size, texture and measurement parameters.” to
“The main reason for these differences is that the T2cutoff is not only
affected by the lithology but also related to pore throat, particle size,
texture and measurement parameters.”
Q7: the proximate analysis of coal samples.
Answer 7: The coal samples were taken from the same coal to ensure
consistency of this experiment. The proximate analysis of coal sample
is the main indicator for understanding the characteristics of coal quality,
and also the basic basis for evaluating coal sample quality. The content
of moisture, volatile matter, ash and fixed carbon in coal can be
determined by proximate analysis of coal sample.
Q8: The table name does not correspond to the table.
Answer 7: We are sorry for our negligence of the table name, we have
modified the table name in the article.
Thank you for your valuable comments.
Reviewer #4:
Q1: the title of the article.
Answer 1: Thank you for your suggestion, we have change the title
“Characteristics of pore structure of high-rank coal by nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR): A case study of the Baijiao coal reservoir, SW China”
to “Petrophysical characterization of high-rank coal by nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR): A case study of the Baijiao coal reservoir,
SW China.”
Q2: Coal pores size types have been divided by many researchers,
authors should elaborate on that.
Answer 2: Thank you for your suggestion, we have elaborated it in the
article. Since the centrifuge pressure is 200 Psi in this article, according
to the reference 21, the pore radius is 100 nm under the 200 Psi, which
the boundary between the percolation pore and the adsorption pore,
therefore, we use the Hodot’s pore classification scheme.
Q3: CBM exists in the coal seam primarily in two states? Some papers
have demonstrated that not two states.
Answer 3: Thank you for your valuable comments. According to the
reference 7, we have change “CBM exists in the coal seam primarily in
two states: adsorbed or free. Adsorbed gas is primarily stored in the
micropores and transition pores, while free gas is preserved in the
mesopores and macropores” to “CBM exists in the coal seam primarily
in three states: free gas in porous matrix, free gas in natural fractures,
and trapped gas adsorbed in matrix.”
Q4: Adsorbed pore and adsorption pore should be unified.
Answer 4: Thank you for your valuable comments. We have modified
this in the article.
Q5: Explain detail why “less than 1.7 ms corresponds to the micropores
(pores with diameters smaller than 10 nm) and transition pores (pore
with diameter in the range 10-100 nm) in coal.
Answer 5: Special thanks to you for your comments. According to the
NMR experiment results and equation 2, it can be obtained a pore
distribution radius curve in the NMR experiment report, this pore
distribution radius corresponds to the T2 spectrum of coal sample. By
processing the pore radius distribution curve, as shown in figure, we can
get the T2 spectrum peak at less than 1.7 ms corresponds to the
micropores (pores with diameters smaller than 10 nm) and transition
pores (pore with diameter in the range 10-100 nm) in coal. The
micropores peak of T2 spectrum has no significant change before and
after centrifugation, which indicates that the connectivity of micropores
and transition pores is poor. The residual water which bound in the
micropores and transition pores cannot be drained by the centrifugation.
Since pore distribution radius of coal sample can be judged by the T2
spectrum at Sw and Sir condition, therefore, the pore distribution radius
curve is not shown in the article.
