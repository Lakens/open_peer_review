The authors deployed accelerometers and speed sensors on large Atlantic blue fin tunas to show
their fine-scale swimming behavior in the wild. Although sample size is only two, I think the
authors did a great job, given the difficulties in obtaining this kind of data from large, wild tunas
(tag recovery points are very far). The data are new to science, and worthy of publication. I am
especially impressed by fast cruising speed of tunas. My comments are minor, and I believe this
paper will be a great contribution to Royal Society Open Science.

Subject Editor Comments:
We hope that the authors will be able to address the comments, recalibrate as necessary, and
resubmit having addressed all reviewers' comments. Thanks for submitting.
Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Denise Greig):
These are fascinating data and it is clear that a lot of work went into this project. Deploying new
biologging technology onto fast moving pelagic species is no small feat, however the methods
and analyses need to be revised for clarity. Additionally one reviewer had serious concerns about
the post-processing of the telemetry data. I hope you will be willing to address his in-depth
concerns and resubmit this manuscript to RSOS.
My specific questions/comments below:
Great introduction!
Methods
The tag descriptions are confusing… I did not see anything about camera portion of the CATS tag
when sat tag portion and casing were described (although it is pictured in Figure 1). What about
the depth and temperature sensors – where on the tag are they located? Are they part of the
Wildlife Computers and ATS portions of the tag? comparable between the two tag types?
Programmed the same way?
Do you expect positively buoyant tag casings to affect your kinematic measurements?
Line 441 please change parenthetical to (see Figure 1 for CATS tag and Whitmore et al for CEFAS
G6a)
Results – the results are confusing/missing some information. Table 2 is helpful for the methods
and results, but in the text it is difficult to figure out which data were acquired from which fish. I
think maybe having the Methods at the end adds to the confusion – is there a reason that you
chose to do this?
Line 160 – first mention of the CATS tag (please add abbreviation) -
Unclear how "glides" are defined (using the video)? Video mentioned in the Discussion but not
Results
Line 234 – this is fish #1 also correct?
Line 453 and 459 – two undefined abbreviations (ABFT and GTR), GTR is defined later in Line
466
Line 459 – please add a references for the washers that are “previously described”
Figure 1D – is the photo upside down?
Figure 3..I thought you only had data from Fish #1 (CATS) and Fish #2 (G6a)? This figure shows
data from Fish #4?

I am glad that the authors rectified the speed data. Nonetheless, the paper needs a careful proof-
reading, as ‘old’ (wrong) numbers have not been replaced throughout. I have marked a few
places, but there can be more. Other than that, I recommend publication. It is a unique set of data.
Manuscript
1. L. 327-328: “swimming speed showed a non-linear relationship with tail-beat frequency for
Fish #2 (Figure 3).”
2. L. 820. Caption to Figure 3. The speed (and stride length) were not updated
3. L. 903. Caption to Figure 6. The speed (2.5 m/s) was not updated
Supplementary
1. Figure S2 (Supplementary S2) should be replaced. It is the old one.
Data in Dryad
1. The abstract seems to reflect the ‘old’ speed calibration: to sustain 3 m/s, a tuna needs more
that 1Hz.
2. The CATS descent data seems to reflect the old calibration. Please check.
3. Some of the columns need units and need explanation. For example, in CATS data: what are
Dmin and Dmax? What is the difference between TBF and TBF_Hz? (The latter is the reciprocal of
the former, and hence the first TBF is probably the tail-beat period in seconds, and not the
frequency). Is TBF in the second file the frequency or the period?
4. I would be happier to see representative time series (at least one full period) of yo-yo, slow
speed burst-and-coast, high speed burst-and-coast, and steady swimming, rather than the
averaged data appearing in Dryad (it can be down-sampled to 10 HZ with hardly any harm).
Having both would have been even better.
Miscellaneous comments
1. L. 282: “Velocity”
2. L. 294: “Cats”
3. L. 778 (Ref. [77]): I am not sure if this reference will pass the production people.
7
4. Figure 3: I would have added lines of constant stride length v/TBF for a reference.
5. I would have been more careful in interpretations of yo-yo and burst-and-coast strategies. Both
can reduce the cost of transport only if (chemo-mechanical) propulsion efficiency is either thrust-
or speed- dependent (Ref. [28], [65] and also the reference cited in footnote 2 of the first review).
With constant propulsion efficiency, the swimming strategy that minimizes the cost of transport
is constant-speed-constant-depth. In the context of these strategies, a few specific comments:
L. 406-410. This is a conjecture. I am not sure if the statement is supported by the data.
L. 435: During acceleration/ascent the fish ‘pays’ for the lack of activity during deceleration/
descent by increasing its TBF, and therefore the frequency argument should probably be
reworded. Adding the word ‘red’ before the word ‘muscles’ could solve most of the problem [65].
L. 473-476: The difference in energetic costs of ascent and descent is independent of speed. It is
just the difference in the potential energy (submerged weight times the change in depth) divided
by the propulsion efficiency.
L. 493: And also the flex at the caudal peduncle.

Comments to the Author:
I would like to commend the authors for the trouble shooting they did to figure out and correct
the manufacturer's mistake. I also very much appreciate the clarifications in the method section
and the response to reviewers. Like Reviewer #2 notes, there are still a few leftover typos from
the first version, but once those are corrected, this will be an interesting addition to the literature
on marine animal locomotion.
Below are the typos I noticed:
Line 143. Delete the word “been”
Line 217. Correct “sing” to “using”
Line 218. Delete “was”
Line 243. Add “(CWT)” as you use this abbreviation in the next sentence? (if that is the correct
interpretation)
Line 289-290. Change to “two CATS camera tags” (I think you used the CATS abbreviation
above)
10
Line 380. Should this be Fish #1? As everything above was talking about Fish #2? Please be
consistent and refer to either Bluefin #1 and #2 or Fish #1 and #2 and use whichever
nomenclature you prefer in Figure 3 as well.
Table 3. Please add a space and an "s" to "363 descents" in the Table title.

Appendix A
The paper presents a unique set of data, but having great concerns about the accuracy
coherency) of this data, I am not in favor of publication. The following comments address
mainly the data issue.
The data
1. The quoted speed values do not fit anything I know about fish locomotion. It is quite unlikely
hat fish # 1 (and, by extension, fish # 2) swam faster than 3 m/s at all times. It is equally
unlikely that a fish (any fish) will use a burst-and-coast swimming strategy at high speed. Four
different arguments to support the first claim follow immediately below. The second claim is
ecapitulated in item 3.
I will start with the basic data that will be needed to present the first three arguments. It
s summarized in the following table:
parameter source value
fork length l (m) table 1 of the paper 2.42
mass m (kg) FishBase 228
effective diameter d (m) from mass, assuming double-ogive shape 0.46
cross section area S (m2) pd2 4 0.17
The mass was estimated from the fork length using a regression from FishBase (a=0.0231,
b=2.934); the effective diameter and the cross section area were estimated from the mass
estimate by assuming that the body has a shape of a double-ogive. Hydrodynamic
characteristics (drag and power – parasite and induced) were estimated using the methods
outlined in the supplementary material to Ref. [28]. Parasite drag estimate has accounted for
ive fins: a pair of pectorals, second dorsal, anal and caudal. Relevant dimensions were
measured on a photograph found on the net. 1
Estimates of the induced drag (drag due to lift) were based on the assumption that most

of the lift is generated by the pectoral fins. The estimate are greatly affected by the excess
density parameter (the ratio of the excess density to the density of water) kSF , which is a priori
unknown. The values in the following table have been based on kSF = 0.04, the maximal value
deemed acceptable based on the lift coefficient (and the fact that large tunas have a swim
bladder). Halving the excess density parameter would have reduced the induced drag four-fold,
but it would have hardly affect the total drag, especially at high speed.

seconds (left panel in figure 4), should have reduced the swim speed by almost 1 m/s. I do not
see a change of this magnitude on figure 4. It is possible that the speed measurement was simply
o slow to capture speed variations on time scale of 1 sec, but then the speed should not have
been displayed in the context of burst-and-coast swimming. Shutting the power off for 3
seconds at 1 m/s would have led to the loss of only 0.2 m/s in the swim speed.
When a negatively buoyant fish stops powering its tail but continues to swim at the same
speed, it must lose its potential energy – in other words, it must go down. The required rate of
descent can be estimated as the ratio of the hydrodynamic power needed to overcome drag
P = (1 2 ) <U+03C1> v3 SCD and the submerged weight kSF mg . Perhaps counterintuitively, large kSF
make the descent rate needed to supply the power smaller. With kSF =0.04, the descent rate that
would have been needed to sustain the swim speed of 3 m/s is 2.5 m/s. It can be interpreted as
a 60° dive. It is not what we see. With kSF =0.02, the descent rate that would have been needed
o sustain the 3 m/s exceeds the swim speed!
I can put it differently. A 1 min-35 m-dive shown on the right panel of figure 4 implies
hat the fish was descending at 0.6 m/s. With k SF = 0.04 , the rate of loss of the potential energy
k SF mgvd is 52 watt. This power can sustain a swim speed of 1.8 m/s (to sustain 3 m/s, kSF
should have been an impossible 0.16). Sinking at 0.6 m/s while swimming at 1.8 m/s can be
nterpreted as a 19° dive. With pitch attitude of 15°, this estimate is viable. I draw the authors’
attention to the fact that the swimming direction will typically lie below the body axis.
Closely following [28] (actually, closely following reference [12] in [28]), and assuming
body temperature of 20°C, I estimate the standard metabolic rate at 0.35 mmol ATP/s.
Combined with hydrodynamic parameters listed in the preceding table (together with
hydrodynamic propulsion efficiency of 0.7 and muscle efficiency of 24 Joule per mmol ATP)
t yields approximately 1 m/s for the swim speed that minimizes the cost of transport. I could
err two-fold in the standard metabolic rate, which would have yielded a 30% higher optimal
speed, and I could err two-fold in the excess density parameter, which would have yielded a
20% lower speed - but I could not err three-fold in the optimal swim speed. It is unlikely that a
ish (any fish) will swim 48 hours at two or three times the energetically-optimal speed.
Ref. [63] reports the stride length (the distance travelled over one tail-beat) for kawakawa
Euthynnus affinis) - a typical thunniform swimmer similar in appearance to the bluefin tuna. I
ecapitulated the relevant data from that reference in the following table. Stride length does not
exceed 0.6 body length. I see this result as rather general, because basic biomechanical analysis
I will skip the one-page derivation here) shows that the optimal stride length for a thunniform
swimmer should be, roughly, the same at the lateral travel of the caudal fin during a tailbeat
i.e. twice the lateral side-to-side amplitude of the caudal fin). Because the latter is limited by
lexibility of the fish body, the stride length of 1.4 body lengths implied here (swimming 1.2
body length a second at 0.9 HZ) seems very unlikely. By the way, in view of the uncertainty in
he speed calibration, I would have been very careful claiming a non-linear tail-beat-frequency-
speed relation.
parameter value value value value value
swim speed v (body lengths per second) 3.1 3.8 4 4.7 8.2
tail-beat frequency f (Hz) 7.7 9.1 10 12.5 14.3
tail amplitude A (side-to-side, body lengths) 0.16 0.26 0.25 0.2 0.34
stride length <U+03BB> = v f (body lengths) 0.40 0.42 0.4 0.38 0.57
2. I do not understand why the authors did not calibrate the speed sensor ‘in vitro’ – if not before
ts deployment, at least after the recorder has been retrieved. Having printed the impeller implies
hat an identical copy can be printed again, and therefore the device can be replicated even if
he original one has been damaged. Because the paper strongly relies on the speed data, I urge
he authors to make the direct calibration and not to rely on an indirect one.
3. Burst and coast strategy is energetically justified only if chemo-mechanical propulsion
efficiency depends on thrust or/and on the twitch frequency [68]. 2 The propulsion efficiency
can certainly change at low speeds because the caudal peduncle may not be flexible enough,
“Locomotion of neutrally buoyant fish with flexible caudal fin,” Journal of Theoretical Biology 399, 2016, pp.
159-165, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.04.001
but I can hardly see how it can change at 3 m/s, which is a large fraction of the maximal speed.
The same remark applies to the locomotion efficiency of the yoyo diving.
Small comments (in no particular order)
1. It is possible that I missed it, but water temperature is nowhere to be found. It is an important
parameter.
2. I think that the mass estimate should appear in the paper. It is important as well.
3. The quality of the figures is inadequate to extract any quantitative information. Either the
quality of the figures should be improved, or the data should be made available as
supplementary material.
4. I think that galvanic-timed release should have been tested in a lab before the claim is made
on its malfunction. It is possible that a different lesson can been learnt from the delayed releases.

We hope that the authors will be able to address the comments, recalibrate as necessary, and
resubmit having addressed all reviewers' comments. Thanks for submitting.
Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Denise Greig):
These are fascinating data and it is clear that a lot of work went into this project. Deploying new
biologging technology onto fast moving pelagic species is no small feat, however the methods
and analyses need to be revised for clarity. Additionally one reviewer had serious concerns
about the post-processing of the telemetry data. I hope you will be willing to address his in-
depth concerns and resubmit this manuscript to RSOS.
We would like to thank the editor for providing us with the opportunity to revise the manuscript.
Below we have given a point-by-point response to both referees. We have not provided a detailed re-
buttal to the first part of the criticisms by referee #2, as related to the swimming speeds being
impossibly high, as he is correct in every single point. We were suspicious of our speed estimates
early on in this work ourselves and indeed, performed these calibrations and a number of validations
(dive angles vs vertical velocities vs dive depths) to consistently receive the same results. Indeed, our
good relationships of TBF and swimming performance also suggested our work was valid.
After careful reading of the criticisms of referee #2, however, we performed the analysis one more
time just to get the same results. This suggested that the only remaining problem was in the hardware
of the data-logger, since if the estimation of depth by the tag was incorrect, all our post-processing
down-stream would be incorrect too. After consulting a detailed bathymetric map of the location
where the fish was released, we found that the recorded depths was exactly twice as large as the sea-
bed depth at that particular location. After approaching the manufacturer with this information, they
conceded that at times 10 and 20 bar sensors were mixed up (apparently, their supplier provides these
unlabelled). Thus is appears a 20bar sensor, rather than 10bar sensor was installed in our unit, which
was then calibrated with the same parameters as a 10bar unit, thus reporting depth values that are
twice as large. Because the error was introduced in the depth calibration, all speed calibrations
appeared valid. We have recalibrated the sensor and adjusted all reported data in the manuscript. We
hope the referee find the data now match the theoretical expectations and we look forward to his
detailed comments about our manuscript.
We apologies to referee #1 that are speed estimates are now far more “ordinary”, than the previous
estimates, although bluefin are still very fast given the temperatures.
My specific questions/comments below:
Great introduction!
Thank you.
Methods
The tag descriptions are confusing… I did not see anything about camera portion of the CATS
tag when sat tag portion and casing were described (although it is pictured in Figure 1). What
about the depth and temperature sensors – where on the tag are they located? Are they part of
the Wildlife Computers and ATS portions of the tag? comparable between the two tag types?
Programmed the same way?
We have moved the methods to follow the introduction. We agree that this has made it considerably
easier to follow the narrative. We have also added more detail about the sensors and their sampling
regimes. Lack of this information was an unnecessary oversight. Apologies.
Added to line 202:
CATS tags sampled tri-axial acceleration, depth and temperature (and additional other sensor data
not used here) at 40 Hz. In addition to its suit of sensors, the CATS tags contained a digital camera
facing the rear of the fish to validate signals from the accelerometers and to document the fishes’
environment.
Added to line 222:
CEFAS G6as sensor array contained tri-axial accelerometers sampled at 30 Hz here, as well as
temperature and depth sampled at 1 Hz.
Do you expect positively buoyant tag casings to affect your kinematic measurements?
This is a very good question. We did not perform quantitative tests of the buoyancy of the tags
compared to those of tuna, but instead minimised excessive positive buoyancy through floatation
tests. We have added the following to line 180:
Both types of tags were encased in positively buoyant foam to permit floatation following pop-off,
potentially altering buoyancy of its carrier. During the design-process excessive positive buoyancy
was minimised to reduce this effect. Completely assembled tags only showed marginal positive
buoyancy as evidenced by only a very small fraction of the tags protruding above the water’s surface
while floating.
Line 441 please change parenthetical to (see Figure 1 for CATS tag and Whitmore et al for
CEFAS G6a)
Done
Results – the results are confusing/missing some information. Table 2 is helpful for the methods
and results, but in the text it is difficult to figure out which data were acquired from which fish.
I think maybe having the Methods at the end adds to the confusion – is there a reason that you
chose to do this?
We have moved the methods before the Results and feel this has helped with clarity.
Line 160 – first mention of the CATS tag (please add abbreviation) - Unclear how "glides" are
defined (using the video)? Video mentioned in the Discussion but not Results Line 234 – this is
fish #1 also correct?
Agreed that this was somewhat unclear as a result of the methods being placed at the end of
manuscript. The section detailing the definition of glides from sensor data is now appears before the
results section. This hopefully helps the reader to understand how passive periods were defined.
Line 453 and 459 – two undefined abbreviations (ABFT and GTR), GTR is defined later in Line
466 Line 459 – please add a references for the washers that are “previously described”
Done
Figure 1D – is the photo upside down?
The angle that the photo was taken in was awkward. If the picture is used right-way up and it appears
even stranger than the upside-down version chosen. Apologies, but we have no other images to
improve this.
Figure 3..I thought you only had data from Fish #1 (CATS) and Fish #2 (G6a)? This figure
shows data from Fish #4?
This has been corrected

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors deployed accelerometers and speed sensors on large Atlantic blue fin tunas to show
their fine-scale swimming behavior in the wild. Although sample size is only two, I think the
authors did a great job, given the difficulties in obtaining this kind of data from large, wild
tunas (tag recovery points are very far). The data are new to science, and worthy of publication.
I am especially impressed by fast cruising speed of tunas. My comments are minor, and I believe
this paper will be a great contribution to Royal Society Open Science.
Thank you for your encouraging words. We hope you find the manuscript improved as a result of the
review.

Done. Also replaced later on in the MS.
L294-295 Here I cannot catch the point. Why are fast and steep ascents related to increasing
horizontal distance? What is "per unit of energetically intensive ascent"?
After reading this sentence again, we agree that some unpacking may be necessary. We have
expanded the sentence in the following manner. We hope this somewhat clarifies the point.
Dives also feature marginally asymmetrical geometries, ascents are both faster and steeper than
descents, thus decreasing the time engaged in the energetically expensive portion of a dive and
increasing the amount of time engaged in gliding phases at shallow angles, thus increasing horizontal
distance traversed per unit energy.
L326 "between ascents and descents"

L391 Thermoregulation is functionally related to foraging in those fishes.
Indeed. We have clarified this point by adding the following to the sentence:
Certainly for Atlantic bluefin tuna and other species of tunas, thermoregulation has been a prominent
explanation for vertical excursions, permitting fish to feed below the thermocline while maintaining
elevated muscle temperatures [48, 49]
L406 Suggest deleting "a number of".
Done
L525-549 It's unclear to me why you didn't calibrate your paddle-whales in flow tanks (or
something similar)? I am concerned that the pitch method doesn't work well for fishes due to
shallow pitch angles in general (and that's why the relationships are so noisy?).
This is a very good question. My personal opinion, and I currently have no data to back this up, is that
because of boundary layer issues, ingression of particles or non-standardised placement of tags on
animals, in situ offer a better means for calibration. It is true that the shallow angles likely result in
increased errors, but these are unlikely to bias the estimation, because error should be equal in over
and underestimation (although variable angle of attack will cause some minor biases). The procedure
we used results in a data-rich data-set, which I argue takes care of this problem. I think our very tight
relationships between tail-beat frequency are evidence for the methods having worked well. Having
said that, it would be a good methodological study in the future to establish which method is superior.
Referee #2
We would like to thank the referee for his very detailed comments. Indeed, his convincing argument
is the reason we have approached the manufacturer (after redoing the analysis on four occasions and
coming up with the same results). This led us to the insight that a mix-up in depth-sensor by the
manufacturer has resulted in a mis-calibration, an overestimation of depth by a factor of two, in turn
resulting in an overestimate in our calibration by the same factor. We have redone he analysis in light
of the new depth calibration, adjusted all figures and graphics throughout the MS and hope this will
take care of this major criticism. Specifically the referee also had a number of more detailed
comments that were presents in his convincing argument.
\
Non-linear fit to TBF and speed
Apologies for this. Indeed, stride-length tends to be conserved across TBFs and thus the relationship
between speed and TBF is generally found to be linear (as we have also found later in the MS, Fig. 5)
and there was no particular reason we fitted this only that it looked marginally better. Linear fits were
essentially just as good as the polynomial (R2=0.61 vs 0.58). We have now only reported a linear fit.
The reason for the minor kink in the low speed range of the graph could either be true signal: fish
introduce more gliding during horizontal swimming at low speeds, similar to gliding being used as a
means to control swimming speed during diving or that there are some minor problems in the
calibration at the lowest speeds.
Small comments (in no particular order)
1. It is possible that I missed it, but water temperature is nowhere to be found. It is an
important parameter.
It is indeed. We have now reported these in Figure 2 as a time-series.
2. I think that the mass estimate should appear in the paper. It is important as well.
Done. It has been added to Table 2
3. The quality of the figures is inadequate to extract any quantitative information. Either the
quality of the figures should be improved, or the data should be made available as
supplementary material.
All data contained in the figures of the paper will be contained in a Dryad repository, as was stated in
the “data accessibility statement”. However, I am eager to hear how the referee suggests our figures
could be improved for clarity to allow the extraction of quantitative information, bearing in mind that
the correlations between the different variables were also reported in the MS?
4. I think that galvanic-timed release should have been tested in a lab before the claim is made
on its malfunction. It is possible that a different lesson can been learnt from the delayed
releases.
Apologies if we were not clear here in why we believe our pop-off mechanism failed. We do not think
the GTR itself failed (these are off the shelf lobster pot releases and are as simple as they come, fail-
safe one could say), but rather that the zip-tie that was passed through the fin got jammed in the
grooves of the tag. The forces of the swimming fish were insufficient to bend the zip-tie and pull the
tag off the fin. We do agree its probably a good idea to elaborate on this, since the new attachment is a
large part of the MS. However, we are not 100% certain that this is the explanation for delayed pop-
off. We have added the following sentence to line 311:
The reason for the delayed pop-off are not known, but we speculate that the stiff zip-ties were jammed
in the grooves of the tag and the fin and only working itself loose following an extended period at
liberty.

I am glad that the authors rectified the speed data. Nonetheless, the paper needs a
careful proof-reading, as ‘old’ (wrong) numbers have not been replaced throughout. I
have marked a few places, but there can be more. Other than that, I recommend
publication. It is a unique set of data.
Thank you for spotting those and thank you again for your thorough review.

Data in Dryad
The abstract seems to reflect the ‘old’ speed calibration: to sustain 3 m/s, a tuna needs
more that 1Hz.
We were unable to change the abstract in Dryad because we are not creating a new
submission. I am assured that once published the new abstract will be adopted.
The CATS descent data seems to reflect the old calibration. Please check. Some of the
columns need units and need explanation. For example, in CATS data: what are Dmin
and Dmax? What is the difference between TBF and TBF_Hz? (The latter is the
reciprocal of the former, and hence the first TBF is probably the tail-beat period in
seconds, and not the frequency). Is TBF in the second file the frequency or the period?
We have added a detailed description of all columns in an additional sheet and fixed the
problem with the descent values. Again, well spotted. Thank you.
I would be happier to see representative time series (at least one full period) of yo-yo,
slow speed burst-and-coast, high speed burst-and-coast, and steady swimming, rather
than the averaged data appearing in Dryad (it can be down-sampled to 10 HZ with
hardly any harm). Having both would have been even better.
We have added all data to Dryad that are necessary to validate our statistical analysis. Since
we do not discuss the data in any detail beyond what is shown in Figure 4, we feel it is not
necessary to share the raw data. Indeed, we have a student currently working on a more
detailed account of the kinematics and would therefore rather not share data beyond what is
published here.
Miscellaneous comments
L. 282: “Velocity”
Done
2. L. 294: “Cats”
We are not sure what the referee refers to here. We have written “CATS” in all caps, as it is
an acronym.
L. 778 (Ref. [77]): I am not sure if this reference will pass the production people.
Well spotted. Thank you. We have fixed it.
Figure 3: I would have added lines of constant stride length v/TBF for a reference.
Done. Very good suggestion. Figure looks improved.
I would have been more careful in interpretations of yo-yo and burst-and-coast
strategies. Both can reduce the cost of transport only if (chemo-mechanical) propulsion
efficiency is either thrust- or speed- dependent (Ref. [28], [65] and also the reference
cited in footnote 2 of the first review). With constant propulsion efficiency, the
swimming strategy that minimizes the cost of transport is constant-speed-constant-
depth. In the context of these strategies, a few specific comments:
We appreciate the referee’s comments and acknowledge that perhaps we could have done a
better job stating some of the assumptions of the hydrodynamic models we have used to
present our argument. We have now added an additional paragraph to line 493 to state that
these assumptions and that they have been tested in bluefin, but that caution needs to be
exercised when transferring this to other species:
It is worth noting, that our discussions related to vertical movements providing an energy
saving for fish rely on an important assumption in Weihs’ theory [17], namely that the
efficiency of transforming chemical energy into mechanical work must differ between ascent
and descent [27]. Weihs’ originally proposed that the drag incurred by a fish swimming with
lateral undulations should be in the region of 2-3 times greater than those of a rigid, gliding
fish. Therefore, if a fish can propel itself passively using gravity during descent, it would
incur substantially less drag than if it were to swim continuously. Takagi et al. [55], using
computational fluid dynamics quantified and confirmed the drag coefficient of juvenile
Pacific bluefin tuna to be greater during undulatory swimming than gliding by a factor of
two, further supporting that tuna may save energy through repeated diving. Some caution
needs to be exercised in translating these data to other fishes, as this effect may not be
universal and might depend on the kinematics of the species in question.
L. 406-410. This is a conjecture. I am not sure if the statement is supported by the data.
Agreed. This statement was poorly worded and as a result misrepresented the literature. We
have changed it in the following manner:
This represents an important aspect of Weihs’ two-stage locomotion model [17, 64],
suggesting that some dives are performed to increase the economy of horizontal movements,
which is in broad agreement with captive work on bluefin tuna [55, 56].
This represents an important aspect of Weihs’ two-stage locomotion model [17, 64],
suggesting that some dives could be performed to increase the economy of horizontal
movements, which is in broad agreement with captive work on bluefin tuna [55, 56].
L. 435: During acceleration/ascent the fish ‘pays’ for the lack of activity during
deceleration/ descent by increasing its TBF, and therefore the frequency argument
should probably be reworded. Adding the word ‘red’ before the word ‘muscles’ could
solve most of the problem [65].
Thank you very good suggestion. We have added “aerobic” instead of red
L. 473-476: The difference in energetic costs of ascent and descent is independent of
speed. It is just the difference in the potential energy (submerged weight times the
change in depth) divided by the propulsion efficiency.
In principal that is true. However, if efficiencies are dependent on speed, then we should also
see differences beyond simply the change in potential energy. Our data show clearly that the
prevalence of gliding is strongly dependent on swimming speed, and since Takagi et al. have
demonstrated that drag is greater by a factor of two during swimming, as opposed to gliding
suggests that drag and by extension mechano-chemical efficiency during descents will
depend on speed. This is confirmed in our data on tail-beat frequency and swimming speed.
We have adjusted this paragraph to reflect the basic tenet that in principal, only potential
energy differs.
Ln 461 At first hand, this may suggest that overcoming buoyant forces (i.e. change in
potential energy) represents a minor component of the power required to swim.
Ln 471 Thus, at faster speeds, the relative cost of counteracting negative buoyancy becomes
increasingly negligible compared to the costs related to parasite drag; subsequently at the
highest speeds we would expect there to be little difference between the energetic costs of
ascents and descents beyond the difference in potential energy.
L. 493: And also the flex at the caudal peduncle.
Agreed. We have changed the sentence in the following manner:
Of course, fish can alter other kinematic parameters that accelerometers cannot easily allude
too, namely tail-beat amplitude or the stiffening of the caudal region, which may be altered
in response to changes in their hydrodynamic environment.
