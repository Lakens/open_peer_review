The origin of the multiple conformations of PAHs in CNTs is a remaining issue to understand the
structural and physical properties of CNTs encapsulating molecules. In this paper, the authors
reveal that the standing and the lying conformations of perylenes have almost same energies by
the DFT calculations, which well explain the experimental observations. Because the paper is
well-written and the conclusion is clearly supported by the calculated results, I would
recommend it for acceptance after addressing minor comments listed below.
1. The most interesting point about the hybrid CNT materials is how the conformation difference
(standing or lying) affects the physical properties of perylenes and CNTs. The paper would be
much better if there is a theoretical prediction of the expected properties depending on the
molecular arrangements.

The authors investigated energetics and electronic structures for CNTs which encapsulating
perylene molecules using first-principles electronic structure calculations based on DFT. They
found that the different encapsulation structures in the experiments are confirmed by the
energetics which is explained by the electronic states of each system. However, the energy
difference of those conformations are similar, and they conclude that the both of those
3
conformations can be realized and it would be decided by the initial condition of the
encapsulation. Their results sound interesting and I recommend the manuscript for the
publication in the journal of RSOS.
Here are some questions and comment, which I believe to improve the manuscript.
1. Could authors comment on the effect of density of perylene molecules, which would be
translated to the effect of pressure applied on perylene molecules inside the nanotubes.
2. Is there any specific ideas for initial conditions which lead to different final conformation.

where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.

Thank you very much for your positive, insightful, and constructive comments.
Question 1
The most interesting point about the hybrid CNT materials is how the conformation difference
(standing or lying) affects the physical properties of perylenes and CNTs. The paper would be much
better if there is a theoretical prediction of the expected properties depending on the molecular
arrangements.
Answer:
Thank you very much for your important comments. As I stated in Fig. 5, the electronic states of CNT
and perylene slightly depend on the perylene conformation. Thus, the optical properties associated
with the electron states near the Fermi level may slightly depend on the molecular conformation. To
mention the point, we added a sentence line 24, page 6 which is printed in red font:
These facts imply that the optical properties of host CTN and guest perylene could be slightly
modulated by the formation of the hybrid structures and molecular conformation.

Reviewer 2

Thank you very much for your constructive and insightful comments.
Question 1:
Could authors comment on the effect of density of perylene molecules, which would be translated
to the effect of pressure applied on perylene molecules inside the nanotubes.
Answer:
We are very sorry, we could not have any ideas to discuss the point. The most difficult problem is
how to define the pressure in nanoscale system.
Question 2
Is there any specific ideas for initial conditions which lead to different final conformation.
Answer:
Thank you for your important comments. For the comments, we think that the molecular
conformation may depend on the perylene density inside the CNT, because the encapsulation
energy per length depends on the molecular conformation. Under the high molecular concentration,
the encapsulated molecules prefer the standing conformation, while they prefer the lying
conformation under the low concentration. To make the discussion about the possibility of the
conformation control, we added sentences in line5 page 4 printed in red fonts:
Regarding with the encapsulation energy per length, we found that the encapsulation of the
standing conformation is larger than that of the lying conformation by approximately twice. Thus,
molecular conformation inside CNT may depend on the number of perylene or perylene density
encapsulated in CNT: Perylene relatively prefers the lying conformation under the high density
condition, while it prefers the standing conformation under the low density condition.
