Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
I very much enjoyed reading this manuscript. And although it provides primarily descriptive
statistics on conservation investments and little in the way of analysis or causal inference, I feel it
makes a very important contribution to understanding how conservation is funded, and what
conservation actions cost in terms of investment. Ideally future work like this can adopt more of
an adaptive management approach in which the efficacy of difference conservation actions is
measured and also associated costs quantified. This would provide the gold standard for guiding
conservation investment decisions.
I appreciate the very detailed accounting of the methods used to acquire financial data, its
limitations, and how they handled imperfect information. I think this is especially important
since few in conservation would know how to approach this kind of question, and this provides a
good methodological roadmap, and reality check, for future work of this kind.
P. 17, l. 15. Population reinforcement: is this captive breeding (and release) costs? If so, please
state.
I think the figures could be reduced as there is a fair amount of redundancy. For example, the
information in Fig 6 is also in Fig 2 in a different form (% vs $), Fig 3 could be eliminated in favor
of Fig 5 (or, better, provide stacked, color coded columns for annual contributions by different
stakeholders), and the details on specific organizations in Fig 4 are not necessary.
Research: is it addressing conservation?
Conservation rewards:
P. 31. The text on conservation application of research needs to be referenced
P. 31, l. 54-6: This statement underscores the major weakness of the study. It necessarily remains
very speculative in determining which investments contributed to recovery. That remains
unknown and so there is no strong take-away message regarding what worked and what didn’t
(adaptive management with finances included to generate true cost-effectiveness estimates).
Could we have reduced funding for research by 50% an obtained the same result? Did the
international NGO investments in social issues pay off?
The papers by Hoffmann et al would be worth reviewing and citing. Although they did not
measure funding per sé, they did show that conservation action explained reversals in IUCN
status; presumably those actions represented funding.(Hoffmann et al. 2010; Hoffmann et al.
2015)

he authors:
paper takes on the very important task of quantifying the costs incurred in the conservation of the
’s Macaw in the process of downlisting it from CR to EN. More papers like this are needed so the
ors should be applauded for this attempt. The abstract indicates that the paper “developed a costs-
ards framework that integrates information on which sectors of society contribute to funding
servation, how much is contributed, how funds are distributed among conservation targets, and how
e investments drive not only conservation rewards but also the economic and ecosystem services
benefit society.“ The authors do a good and detailed job of providing information on what sectors
ociety contributed and how each sector’s contributions were used. This part is very informative and
ides a great deal of insight in to the workings of this large and complex conservation program.
ever, the article mostly fail’s to achieve the second set of objectives “and how these investments
e not only conservation rewards but also the economic and ecosystem services that benefit society.”
result, this second point becomes a main focus of this review (see Review Table 1, below). Some
enditures were discussed and judged in the absence of much data or support from the literature
ing these judgments somewhat suspect. Other expenditures (like research, that made up 51% of the
get) were not discussed at all. The absence of a detailed discussion of research is a rather grave error
its omission is highly puzzling as it seems as though it would be relatively simple to provide a fairly
iled evaluation of the importance of research to the recovery of this species.

tings by stating:
“Meeting expenses were equivalent to resources spent on 10 years of monitoring (censuses) the

conservation actions applied.”
clearly makes it seem like meetings are trivial. In a quick review of the two references cited to
port their argument that recovery team meetings are not useful, I see no discussion at all about
very meetings. There is some discussion of the effectiveness of written plans, but not meetings. This
ion should be eliminated or evaluated in a more evenhanded way. One could counter that the
tings did have many positive impacts that would be hard to quantify without further interviewing of
ect participants. It is certainly possible that some of the NGOs that participated directly in the
tings may have felt they were an important part of their decisions to keep funding the project. The
ange in information there may have also improved the management of the species in a variety of
s. Neither of these would have been picked up in the current study.
larly the part on written reports starting on Page 20 line 42 seems quite thin. The authors cite only a
le reference in this section. It states that only 37% of the actions in the Lear’s Action Plan had been
lemented. The author imply with this that the plan was a failure. However, this seems like a one-
ensional way of viewing the usefulness of the plan. If there had been no plan, what number of
ons would have been implemented? Perhaps quite a few less. In addition, in spite of the fact that
37% of the activities were implemented, the species populations increased enough to be down
d, again showing the ineffectiveness of percent of actions implemented as a measure of
servation relevance.
P 20 lines 46 to 52 the authors state that it is hard to evaluate the effectiveness of plans because it is
to track the actions of managers because managers rarely report their actions. In addition, it is
to track the costs of the actions taken by the managers. I do not see the logic in this argument.

municate the importance and urgency of stopping poaching at the nesting and roosting cliffs. This

here do the authors try to communicate the importance of this. As someone familiar with the
ory of the conservation of the species, the protection of the nesting and roosting grounds were
oubtedly the single most important action taken on behalf of the species. It may have been
onsible for the vast majority of the recovery seen to date. Anyone choosing to argue to the contrary
ld need to provide a detailed argument to the contrary. Also it is important to note that the
ulation HAS recovered to the point of downlisting. However, the authors seem to take an overall
ative tone when discussing the protection of the nesting and roosting areas. In particular the authors
e that the activities “may have” reduced the number of macaws poached for pet trade. In addition
write a number of other negatively slanted comments like:
1. These facts demonstrate that the efforts devoted to area protection were insufficient to secure
the protection of the species within its current range or to cover the spatial expansion of the
population.
2. In fact, these investments have helped to alleviate the threats but they did not eliminate them
completely. Lear’s macaws are still poached, most likely from unprotected nesting sites, to
supply the illegal trade.
3. Thus, most poached individuals likely remained undected. In addition, although 24% (221,097.8
ha) of the Lear's macaw occurrence area is under some protection regime, whether in the form
of protected areas or indigenous lands, we have no reason to believe that these areas are not
subject to strong pressures and impacts (60).
f these are statements that I would expect in a conservation obituary or call for a last stand, not a
ies that went from less than 100 to over 1200 in 25 years! The authors should change this tone to
light the successes and discuss the current shortcomings in management in the light of the overall
ess.
also seems to be a good point to bring up an important omission in the analysis of the data. To my
wledge, there are a number of explanatory stories underlying the population data presented in
re 10. If I am not mistaken there are publications looking at how discovery of new populations and
nges in counting methodology have likely influenced the total counts. I think one paper even tried to
that the increase in counts did not correspond with an increase in population size! I imagine that
e of these issues are impacting the data presented in Figure 10. I acknowledge that a detailed
ussion of the history of the population counts is beyond the scope of the paper, I think a closer look
ese values and a brief history is warranted.
ddition, the authors do not highlight the fact that Figure 10 suggests that the rate of population
wth may be slowing down. Up until 2009 the population seems to have been growing faster than it is
2010 to 2014. This could lend support to the arguments of failings in the current management
me. P 22 line 54. In this section the authors could discuss this apparent leveling off.
e 22 line 14: The authors seem to be slanted against the corn replenishment program (except for the
sentence in the paragraph). The section starts by saying “LARGE amounts of money were . . . “ The
h is that it represents about 3% of the total expenditure on the species. So selling this as a “large
unt of money” seems misleading. Again it seems to be biased towards showing the corn
acement program as inefficient. On P 22 line 22 the authors state “We did not find a relationship
ween the damages caused to corn plantations and the number of macaws killed annually, thus
stioning the effectiveness of this compensatory action.” I do not see the logic here. You would
ect more macaws killed with more damage in the ABSENCE of a compensation program. If the
ram truly decoupled the relationship that could easily be taken as a measure of SUCCESS! Of course
have no idea what % of the macaws killed were actually reported, so it is hard to use number of
aws known to be killed as a measure.
h regards to habitat, I know that there was a reforestation project with Licuri that was attempted. It
based on irrigation. A government agency planted Licuri, put in an expensive watering system, after
w months, the watering system broke and the trees all died. This could be looked for and added to

er like this were to show that government funds were being spent in a way that was considered
fficient” that would reflect badly on the government including CEMAVE. As a result, the lead author
works for CEMAVE certainly has a conflict of interest here. Also, it would be good to know how long
lead author has been working on the species (especially how long he has been working on the
ies from within CEMAVE). If the author has overseen much of the time frame when the money was
nt, or was in any way part of the team that allocated where the money went, then there is certainly a
lict of interest. As a result, any discussion of research efficiency could be colored by this reality.

w inefficiency in the use of those moneys.
larly, it would be good to know if the second author, or any of the second author’s graduate
ents are being funded by programs sponsored by the Brazilian Government. If the second author
efits in any way from federal research funds from Brazil, then he too may be hesitant to criticize the
iency of these research funds as it could jeopardize future funding. More information on conflict of
rest could help explain this.

agine that if you stopped the major loss of adults and chicks, you would expect the population to
w following a logistic growth curve. As a result, the growth could easily match what is seen in the

ors wish to make the claim of how additional money helped beyond that, they should need to show
tional evidence.
ummary, this is a very interesting paper. It presents very highly relevant and useful data on who paid
much for the conservation of the Lear’s Macaw. However, the discussion is incomplete and seems
e curiously biased for or against certain topics.
Appendix B
Dear editor,
We are delighted with the very detailed suggestions provided by the reviewer. On the other
hand, we apologize for our delay in preparing a revised version, due to our multiple field work
expeditions and unavoidable compromises we had since we received this review. Here we are
providing a fully revised version where we take into account all the suggestions provided by
the reviewer in his/her letter and the annotated PDF manuscript, as we detail below. All
changes done are shown in the manuscript.
To the authors:
This paper takes on the very important task of quantifying the costs incurred in the
conservation of the Lear’s Macaw in the process of downlisting it from CR to EN. More
papers like this are needed so the authors should be applauded for this attempt. The
abstract indicates that the paper “developed a costsrewards framework that integrates
information on which sectors of society contribute to funding conservation, how much is
contributed, how funds are distributed among conservation targets, and how these
investments drive not only conservation rewards but also the economic and ecosystem
services that benefit society.“ The authors do a good and detailed job of providing
information on what sectors of society contributed and how each sector’s contributions
were used. This part is very informative and provides a great deal of insight in to the
workings of this large and complex conservation program.
RE: We also think the costs-rewards framework we developed could be applied to a number of
other threatened species under conservation management, so this is an important point of our
paper as our novel framework could be used by many other researchers and wildlife
managers.
However, the article mostly fail’s to achieve the second set of objectives “and how these
investments drive not only conservation rewards but also the economic and ecosystem
services that benefit society.” As a result, this second point becomes a main focus of this
review (see Review Table 1, below). Some expenditures were discussed and judged in the
absence of much data or support from the literature making these judgments somewhat
suspect. Other expenditures (like research, that made up 51% of the budget) were not
discussed at all. The absence of a detailed discussion of research is a rather grave error and
its omission is highly puzzling as it seems as though it would be relatively simple to provide a
fairly detailed evaluation of the importance of research to the recovery of this species.
RE: These comments and the summarizing table elaborated by the reviewer (see detailed
comments below) greatly helped us to realize our flaws in exposing some results and
discussing them. We agree there is still little information on ecosystem services provided by
Lear’s macaws and it is hard to quantify them. Therefore, we have removed ecosystem
services from our objectives and just make brief comments in Discussion. We have not
removed them from our costs-rewards framework since this conceptual scheme could be
applied to other species, and even ecosystem services provided by Lear’s macaws could be
better analysed in the future. Regarding research, we now discuss better its implications (see
more detailed explanations across this response letter).
Section 3.2.3 and 4.3.3
These sections seem a little too thin to warrant inclusion as a full sections. It is important
that parrots are now being shown to disperse seeds, but in the absence of the presentation
of any data on this, I think this idea can be confined to the discussion (and perhaps
introduction), but it is not needed in the Results, methods, or Abstract. The second author
has published a great deal on this topic and is preparing another manuscript on this topic in
Lear’s Macaws. In addition, this is an economic analysis paper and there is no estimate of
dollar value of this, so it is not warranted as a full section.
RE: Accordingly, we have removed the corresponding section of Results (no section about
ecosystem services was provided in Methods), and have reworded the Discussion section
making it shorter. In Abstract, we only mention that ecosystem services have yet to be
quantified.
Discussion
Page 20 Line 31: Meeting expenses. The authors are clearly biased against holding meetings.
Meetings and census BOTH accounted for 4% of the total budget. But the authors chose to
present the cost of meetings by stating:
“Meeting expenses were equivalent to resources spent on 10 years of monitoring (censuses)
the species, which is needed to determine population trends and the potential effectiveness
of the conservation actions applied.”
This clearly makes it seem like meetings are trivial. In a quick review of the two references
cited to support their argument that recovery team meetings are not useful, I see no
discussion at all about recovery meetings. There is some discussion of the effectiveness of
written plans, but not meetings. This section should be eliminated or evaluated in a more
evenhanded way. One could counter that the meetings did have many positive impacts that
would be hard to quantify without further interviewing of project participants. It is certainly
possible that some of the NGOs that participated directly in the meetings may have felt they
were an important part of their decisions to keep funding the project. The exchange in
information there may have also improved the management of the species in a variety of
ways. Neither of these would have been picked up in the current study.
Similarly the part on written reports starting on Page 20 line 42 seems quite thin. The
authors cite only a single reference in this section. It states that only 37% of the actions in
the Lear’s Action Plan had been implemented. The author imply with this that the plan was a
failure. However, this seems like a onedimensional way of viewing the usefulness of the
plan. If there had been no plan, what number of actions would have been implemented?
Perhaps quite a few less. In addition, in spite of the fact that only 37% of the activities were
implemented, the species populations increased enough to be down listed, again showing
the ineffectiveness of percent of actions implemented as a measure of conservation
relevance.
On P 20 lines 46 to 52 the authors state that it is hard to evaluate the effectiveness of plans
because it is hard to track the actions of managers because managers rarely report their
actions. In addition, it is hard to track the costs of the actions taken by the managers. I do
not see the logic in this argument. Managers will take actions with or without overall plans.
The way to evaluate the efficiency of the plans would be to evaluate whether or not
managers carried out more effective actions due to the plans or not. This section should be
clarified or removed.
In summary, this entire paragraph should probably be reworked to try and make it a more
balanced discussion of meetings and plans, or preferably should be eliminated from the
document as there is basically no data on this topic in the paper or in the references cited by
the authors.
RE: We have reworded and largely shorten this paragraph following these suggestions rather
than removing it, as we feel some mention to these expenses is needed in Discussion.
P 21 L 11. Please remove the word Palliation and derivatives from the entire document. Its
definition suggests providing supportive care to terminally ill patients, not finding a cure that
enables long-term conservation and survival.
RE: Done. We use now words such as mitigation or reducing
The section 4.2 on Conservation Threats strikes me as somewhat odd. The authors don’t
seem to communicate the importance and urgency of stopping poaching at the nesting and
roosting cliffs. This captured adults in the breeding and non-breeding season and likely
disrupted breeding. As a result, this may have eliminated breeding success and removed
adults leading to a major reduction in populations. Nowhere do the authors try to
communicate the importance of this. As someone familiar with the history of the
conservation of the species, the protection of the nesting and roosting grounds were
undoubtedly the single most important action taken on behalf of the species. It may have
been responsible for the vast majority of the recovery seen to date. Anyone choosing to
argue to the contrary would need to provide a detailed argument to the contrary. Also it is
important to note that the population HAS recovered to the point of downlisting. However,
the authors seem to take an overall negative tone when discussing the protection of the
nesting and roosting areas. In particular the authors state that the activities “may have”
reduced the number of macaws poached for pet trade. In addition they write a number of
other negatively slanted comments like:
1. These facts demonstrate that the efforts devoted to area protection were insufficient to
secure the protection of the species within its current range or to cover the spatial expansion
of the population. 2. In fact, these investments have helped to alleviate the threats but they
did not eliminate them completely. Lear’s macaws are still poached, most likely from
unprotected nesting sites, to supply the illegal trade. 3. Thus, most poached individuals
likely remained undected. In addition, although 24% (221,097.8 ha) of the Lear's macaw
occurrence area is under some protection regime, whether in the form of protected areas or
indigenous lands, we have no reason to believe that these areas are not subject to strong
pressures and impacts (60).
All of these are statements that I would expect in a conservation obituary or call for a last
stand, not a species that went from less than 100 to over 1200 in 25 years! The authors
should change this tone to highlight the successes and discuss the current shortcomings in
management in the light of the overall success.
RE: We agree we -unintentionally- gave a negative tone here. Accordingly, we have reworded
and shorten the whole paragraph following the reviewer’s suggestions.
This also seems to be a good point to bring up an important omission in the analysis of the
data. To my knowledge, there are a number of explanatory stories underlying the population
data presented in Figure 10. If I am not mistaken there are publications looking at how
discovery of new populations and changes in counting methodology have likely influenced
the total counts. I think one paper even tried to say that the increase in counts did not
correspond with an increase in population size! I imagine that some of these issues are
impacting the data presented in Figure 10. I acknowledge that a detailed discussion of the
history of the population counts is beyond the scope of the paper, I think a closer look at
these values and a brief history is warranted.
In addition, the authors do not highlight the fact that Figure 10 suggests that the rate of
population growth may be slowing down. Up until 2009 the population seems to have been
growing faster than it is from 2010 to 2014. This could lend support to the arguments of
failings in the current management scheme. P 22 line 54. In this section the authors could
discuss this apparent leveling off.
RE: To our knowledge, there is not a published paper showing a reanalysis of population
trends, but just some preliminary results shown in conferences. Erica Pacifico, within her PhD
supervised by the second author of this paper, is modelling population trends taking into
account variations among years in census efforts, imperfect detection and the recent discovery
of new, small populations. So far, preliminary results suggest that the population growth was
even larger than previously thought, as well as the total population size, in recent years.
However, this work is still in progress and does not change the overall positive population
trend of the species that allowed to downlist it form CR to EN. Therefore, we prefer to
maintain the yet published population trend (Fig. 10) and do not discuss it, as it will be
discussed in detail in another publication once E. Pacifico will finish her work.
Page 22 line 14: The authors seem to be slanted against the corn replenishment program
(except for the last sentence in the paragraph). The section starts by saying “LARGE amounts
of money were . . . “ The truth is that it represents about 3% of the total expenditure on the
species. So selling this as a “large amount of money” seems misleading. Again it seems to be
biased towards showing the corn replacement program as inefficient. On P 22 line 22 the
authors state “We did not find a relationship between the damages caused to corn
plantations and the number of macaws killed annually, thus questioning the effectiveness of
this compensatory action.” I do not see the logic here. You would expect more macaws killed
with more damage in the ABSENCE of a compensation program. If the program truly
decoupled the relationship that could easily be taken as a measure of SUCCESS! Of course
we have no idea what % of the macaws killed were actually reported, so it is hard to use
number of macaws known to be killed as a measure.
RE: Once again, it seems we unintentionally gave a negative tone in this section of Discussion.
We have reworded this paragraph to avoid it.
With regards to habitat, I know that there was a reforestation project with Licuri that was
attempted. It was based on irrigation. A government agency planted Licuri, put in an
expensive watering system, after a few months, the watering system broke and the trees all
died. This could be looked for and added to show that some money was invested in habitat
restoration in foraging areas.
RE: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, we now briefly comment this failed action.
Research: According to the data presented in the paper, about US $ 1.8 million was spent on
research. The vast majority came from the government. Yet all that is discussed about this
money is
“Research on endangered species is needed for adequate planning of conservation efforts
(54). Research investment in Lear’s macaw is reflected in an increase from six articles
published in peer-reviewed journals in 1999 to 17 in 2016 as well as in two master theses
and an ongoing PhD thesis.”
This research output in the form of scientific papers is impressive and shows success by one
measure. However, the objective is the conservation of the species. Is there any evidence
that research contributed to the recovery of the species? The authors shed doubt on the
effectiveness of protecting nesting sites from poaching and compensating farmers for lost
corn (ostensibly to keep them from shooting the macaws), yet assume that US$ 1.8 Million
was good for the species without any analysis whatsoever. This seems odd and makes the
reader wonder why. The authors could have looked at the state of published knowledge at
the start of the management program and then looked to see what information discovered
during funded government research actually was used in actions to aid the conservation of
the species. In this way, they could have assessed at some level the impact of research on
the conservation of the species.
RE: We agree with the reviewer we overlooked potential conservation rewards of research.
We have added several sentences in the section 4.3.1 (Conservation rewards, page 24, first
paragraph) showing the several ways in which research increased the knowledge on the
ecology and conservation threats of the species and how it could had guided conservation
actions. Although derived actions dealt just with the protection of the species, they could had
been enough to allow its population recovery
The manuscript has an ethics statement. I am not sure if that is the same as a US conflict of
interest statement. If it is, I think there are a few things that would been to be included here:
CEMAVE is a government agency that is charged with the conservation of birds in Brazil. If a
scientific paper like this were to show that government funds were being spent in a way that
was considered “inefficient” that would reflect badly on the government including CEMAVE.
As a result, the lead author who works for CEMAVE certainly has a conflict of interest here.
Also, it would be good to know how long the lead author has been working on the species
(especially how long he has been working on the species from within CEMAVE). If the author
has overseen much of the time frame when the money was spent, or was in any way part of
the team that allocated where the money went, then there is certainly a conflict of interest.
As a result, any discussion of research efficiency could be colored by this reality. Government
money was spent on research so responsible government employees may be hesitant to
show inefficiency in the use of those moneys.
Similarly, it would be good to know if the second author, or any of the second author’s
graduate students are being funded by programs sponsored by the Brazilian Government. If
the second author benefits in any way from federal research funds from Brazil, then he too
may be hesitant to criticize the efficiency of these research funds as it could jeopardize
future funding. More information on conflict of interest could help explain this.
RE: It is true the first author (AEBA) works in CEMAVE since 11 years ago. He participated in the
elaboration of the Action Plan for the Lear’s macaw and was the coordinator of the Action Plan
(second edition) and of the census of the species until 2014. This paper results from his Master
Thesis, supervised by the second author (JLT), and in no way the results and discussion of this
paper may compromise his position in CEMAVE. On the other hand, JLT has also supervised a
PhD (by E. Pacifico) on the population ecology and genetics of the species. JLT did not receive
funds from the Brazilian government nor is looking for additional research funds to study the
species. Frankly, none of the authors have ethic conflicts nor conflicts of interests with the
Brazilian government or other funding bodies. We are not sure whether we should estate it in
this Ethics Section, so we leave the decision to the editor.
We feel the worries from the reviewer came from our failure to better develop a discussion on
the rewards of research activities, which we feel we are now discussing adequately. The
reviewer suspected we avoided to criticize the investment on research as the Brazilian
government (CEMAVE) could be unhappy. However, a clear demonstration of the fact that we
did not try to avoid unhappy reactions by CEMAVE is that our previous, inaccurate wording
gave a rather negative tone to the usefulness of the meetings and Action Plan that were also
sponsored and coordinated by CEMAVE, as the reviewer noted.
I am a bit concerned about a statement in the discussion:
“Our results showed a strong positive association between the amount of annual funding
allocated for a species and its population trends, suggesting that conservation funds
effectively contributed to the recovery of the species.”
I imagine that if you stopped the major loss of adults and chicks, you would expect the
population to grow following a logistic growth curve. As a result, the growth could easily
match what is seen in the graph in the absence of the extra spending. This “null hypothesis”
should be considered and then if the authors wish to make the claim of how additional
money helped beyond that, they should need to show additional evidence.
RE: We fully agree with this possibility, that protection actions resulting in a reduction of bird
losses (poaching and killing) could explain by itself most of the population recovery of the
species. We now discuss it twice in Discussion. However, it is difficult to disentangle the effects
of protection from others, as they could act simultaneously and synergistically. For example, as
we now discuss more clearly, the continuous -and increasing with years- research activities in
the nesting and roosting sites may have discouraged people from poaching chicks and killing
adults, thus also contributing in an unmeasurable way to increase the growth rate of the
population.
In summary, this is a very interesting paper. It presents very highly relevant and useful data
on who paid how much for the conservation of the Lear’s Macaw. However, the discussion is
incomplete and seems to be curiously biased for or against certain topics.
RE: We feel this revised version presents a much more complete and balanced discussion
thanks to the useful suggestions and comments provided by the reviewer.
Appendix C
Dear editor,
We are delighted with the impressions and suggestions by the reviewers. Here we are
providing a fully revised version where we take into account all minor suggestions provided by
the reviewer. All changes done are shown in the manuscript.
To the authors:
P. 17, l. 15. Population reinforcement: is this captive breeding (and release) costs? If so,
please state.
RE: Done.
I think the figures could be reduced as there is a fair amount of redundancy. For example,
the information in Fig 6 is also in Fig 2 in a different form (% vs $), Fig 3 could be eliminated
in favor of Fig 5 (or, better, provide stacked, color coded columns for annual contributions by
different stakeholders), and the details on specific organizations in Fig 4 are not necessary.
RE: We agree there is redundant and unnecessary information. Therefore, we have removed
the figure 4. Additionally, we have transferred the figure 6 to supplementary material to share
to whom it may concern. We have combined the figures 3 and 5 for the easiest visualization to
readers about investments tendency from each sector.
Research: is it addressing conservation?
RE: Yes. Scientific research aimed at generating or updating information on the species to
guide conservation actions.
P. 31. The text on conservation application of research needs to be referenced.
RE: Done.
P. 31, l. 54-6: This statement underscores the major weakness of the study. It necessarily
remains very speculative in determining which investments contributed to recovery. That
remains unknown and so there is no strong take-away message regarding what worked and
what didn’t (adaptive management with finances included to generate true cost-
effectiveness estimates). Could we have reduced funding for research by 50% an obtained
the same result? Did the international NGO investments in social issues pay off?
RE: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, we have reworded this section and now briefly
comment on the articles suggested.
