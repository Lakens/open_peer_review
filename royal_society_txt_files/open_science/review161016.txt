The submitted manuscript reports the enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction on hybrids of cobalt
phosphide and molybdenum phosphide.As far as I know, many papers have been published on
bimetal alloys, and material design methodologies for optimizing the electronic structure and
electrochemical activity has been well investigated. However, in this article, the electrochemical
tests are not detailed, and the depth of mechanism analysis is also not enough. Therefore I think
this paper is not suitable for publishing in Royal Society Open Science in current form, the
numerous errors need be corrected.

*********
The manuscript by Fang et al. reported the synthesis of a series of CoP/MoP hybrids
with different Co/Mo ratio for the enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction. They
found the HER activity shows a volcano shape and reaches a maximum for Co/Mo = 1.
In addition, They uses XRD analyses to confirm the formation of a major ternary
interstitial hexagonal CoMoP2 crystal phase, which accounts for the enhancement of
the electrochemical activity. The results are impressive, and overall, the manuscript
was well written. Therefore, I recommend the acceptance of this study.
My minor concerns were copied below:
(1) For the CoP/MoP hybrids, the authors sometimes use Co0.5Mo0.5P, sometimes use
Co0.5Mo0.5P. Please unify them in the whole manuscript;
(2) Authors are suggested to refer to the home-style of RSC paper to prepare their
manuscript. There are a lot of errors in format, including the citations in the
manuscript and the final references;
(3) If CoMoP2 phase is the determining materials to enhance the activity of CoP/MoP
hybrids for HER, is it possible to prepare pure CoMoP2 phase or separate it from the
mixed products?
(4) In the absence of CoMoP2 phase, what is the mechanism for a physical mixture of
CoP and MoP with enhanced activity for HER?
(5) I may like to suggest the authors to add details in their electrochemical
measurements, for example, how to prepare working electrode? what is the amount
used in the tests?

Response to Referees’ Comments
We appreciate very much the reviewers’ efforts to improve our manuscript. We have incorporated almost all of
them in the revised manuscript and the Supporting Supplementary Materials.
Referee 1
1, On page 6, “Fig 4” should be replaced by “Figure 5” in “ The Tafel curves recorded on the CoMoP catalysts
as shown in Figure 4a...”,“Fig 4b shows the dependence of the obtained Tafel slopes to the cobalt
content...”and“The data in Figure 4b showed decreasing Tafel slopes ...”. Besides, The Co0.5Mo0.5P catalyst
annealed at 1000<U+2103> should be marked as Co0.5Mo0.5P-1000 rather than Co0.5Mo0.5P-650.What’s more, I even
can’t find the graph of Figure 7a and Figure 7b in the paper. The authors should thoroughly proof read their
manuscript prior to submission.
Answer:
The Referee’s comment is deeply appreciated. In page 6, the figure numbers regarding Tafel slopes have been
corrected to Figure 5. Figure 7a and 7b have been added in page 8.
2, Polarization curves of the MoP and CoP in Figure 1a and the standard XRD patterns of CoMoP2 in Figure 2
should be given.

3, The fundamental test data should be enriched, such as the EDX spectrum, Transmission Electron
Microscopy, and I–t curve. In order to further insights into the valence of transition metals at the CoMoP2
catalyst surface, XPS measurements should be supplemented.
Answer:
The XPS spectra in the Co, Mo and P region of the Co0.5Mo0.5P hybrid have been added in Figure S2 in the
Electronic Supplementary Materials, and the discussions as written below are added in page 4 and page 5 line 1-
5. The Co 2p spectrum (Figure S2a) showed two dominating peaks appeared at 777.0 eV and 791.8 eV
corresponding to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 signals, respectively. The minor broad peak at 780 eV indicates the
presence of surface oxidized Co species resulting from the contact with air. The Mo 3d spectrum as shown in
Figure S2b showed strong 3d5/2 peak at 227.8 eV and 3d3/2 peak at 231.1 eV. These peaks are assigned to zero
valence state metallic Mo which indicates no or very little oxidation occurs on the Mo site. In the P 2P XPS
spectrum shown in Figure S2c, the strong peak at 129.4 eV is assigned to negative charged (metal-Pd-)
phosphide. The minor peak at 133.4 eV is referred to the P-O species.

EDX spectra and corresponding atomic ratios of the Co0.5Mo0.5P catalyst have been added in Figure S4 in the
Electronic Supplementary Materials. The EDX spectra collected by a TEM equipped with an EDX analyzer
showed signals from Co, Mo and P elements. The Cu signals resulted from the Cu grid. The atomic percentages
of Co, Mo and P elements obtained are 26.9, 24.2 and 48.9 %, respectively, which answers to the composition
of Co0.5Mo0.5P well. These statements have been added in page 5 line 15-20.

An I-t curve of the Co0.5Mo0.5P catalyst has been added in Figure S8 in Electronic Supplementary Materials.
The cathodic current density recorded for driving the HER at overpotential of 165 mV as a function of time is
plotted below. The current density slightly decreased about 5% after 6 h of electrolysis. These results implies
that the Co0.5Mo0.5P catalyst is a highly efficient and cathodically stable HER catalyst in the acidic
environment. The aforementioned has been added in page 8 line 4-7.

(1) For the CoP/MoP hybrids, the authors sometimes use Co0.5Mo0.5P, sometimes use Co0.5Mo0.5P. Please unify
them in the whole manuscript;
Answer:
The formula Co<U+F06A>Mo<U+F074>P (ratio of Co to Mo is superscript) is used to represent the composition of the hybrids. To
prevent confusion between the Co0.5Mo0.5P hybrid and the crystal phase CoMoP2. We have defined “h-
CoMoP2” to represent the hexagonal CoMoP2 crystal phase. Corresponding description has been added in page
3 line 9 from the bottom “(hereinafter h-CoMoP2 is referred to represent this crystal phase in order to
distinguish the crystal phase from the hybrid composition Co0.5Mo0.5P)”. All “CoMoP2” terms have been
changed to “h-CoMoP2”.
(2) Authors are suggested to refer to the home-style of RSC paper to prepare their manuscript. There are a lot of
errors in format, including the citations in the manuscript and the final references;
Answer:
The manuscript was written based on the Royal Society Open Science’s template and the references were listed
using Royal Society Open Science’s style. Royal Society Open Science uses different manuscript and reference
styles from the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC).
(3) If CoMoP2 phase is the determining materials to enhance the activity of CoP/MoP hybrids for HER, is it
possible to prepare pure CoMoP2 phase or separate it from the mixed products?
Answer:
Through carefully modifying the ratio of precursors, reaction temperature, pressure or using different synthetic
methods, it should be possible (but not easy) to prepare pure CoMoP2 phase. We have tried to prepare it,
however, minor secondary phases still existed in the products. We are currently working on this issue. We hope
the reviewer can allow us not to add data from pure CoMoP2 phase at present, because it may take a long time
to achieve the pure crystal.
(4) In the absence of CoMoP2 phase, what is the mechanism for a physical mixture of CoP and MoP with
enhanced activity for HER?
Answer:
Polarization curves of the HER of physical mixtures of CoP/MoP powder have been supplemented in the Figure
S5 in the Electronic Supplementary Materials. The obtained polarization curves showed HER activity ranging
between CoP and MoP. This result indicates clearly that the physical mixture of CoP and MoP powder does not
enhance the HER activity, while the h-CoMoP2 crystal phase does. The aforementioned has been added in page
7, line 5 from the bottom in the manuscript.

(5) I may like to suggest the authors to add details in their electrochemical measurements, for example, how to
prepare working electrode? what is the amount used in the tests
Answer:
The electrodes for the electrochemical measurements were fabricated as follows. Catalyst ink was prepared
by mixing catalyst powder with milli-Q water solution (1 mL for 10 mg of electrocatalyst). 5 % Nafion
dispersion (DuPont) was added (50 mg solid Nafion for 100 mg of catalyst) to the catalyst slurry. Catalyst
coating on glassy carbon electrode with 0.196 cm2 active area was fabricated by drop-casting the catalyst ink on
with a micropipette. The catalyst loading was 0.4 mg catalyst cm-2. The electrode was then dried under vacuum
at room temperature. The electrolytes for electrochemical measurements were prepared with perchloric acid
(Aldrich) and Milli-Q water (Millipore). Pt foil (purity 99.999%) was purchased from Aldrich. All the
electrochemical measurements were performed in 0.1 M HClO4 (aq) electrolyte, which was deaerated with
hydrogen gas before use. A platinum wire, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode (3M KCl) were used as the
counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. All potentials, E, are quoted with respect to reversible
hydrogen electrode (RHE).
The aforementioned has been added in the Experimental Section in Page 2.
