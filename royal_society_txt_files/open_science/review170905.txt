This manuscript reported an exploratory study on low concentration hexavalent chromium
adsorption by Fe(III)-crosslinked chitosan beads. It is interesting and useful for wastewater
treatment, especially for wastewater with low Cr6+ concentration. In my opinion, this manuscript
can be accepted for publication after some minor revisions below.
1. Some language errors have been found in this manuscript. For example, in the first paragraph
of introduction, “attentions have been paid on the development”, in this phrase on should be
replaced by to, attention is an uncountable noun, and it has no plural form. “prevents its broad
application”, first prevent is not a good word here, constrain or limit is better. In addition,
constraining or limiting should be used instead of using constrain or limit. In methods section, as
following should be as follows. There are still other similar errors. Authors are suggested to
proofread the language again carefully.
2. It is good that authors provided detailed discussion on the experimental results. However, I
would like to advise authors to discuss its potential application in wastewater treatment. How
can these laboratory results be used in practice? Is its cost high compared with other materials?
How will its efficiency be if this approach is used in practice? What kind of conditions does this
approach require if it is used in practice? I believe adding such contents in your paper will
generate more interests to our readers.
3. Figure 3 has low resolution. Please provide a high resolution figure.
4. All variables such as k, q, C, and K in tables should be in italic form.
Finally, I would like to congratulate the authors. They have done a good job.

General Comments
The paper focuses on continuous adsorption study and adsorption properties of Fe(III)-
crosslinked chitosan beads. The study indicates that chitosan beads could effectively remove low
concentration hexavalent chromium.
Overall, this paper is written clearly and may be of interest to practitioners in the field that wish
to carry out column studies to remove of low concentration hexavalent chromium from waste
water. The conclusions are supported by the experimental work. However; the reviewer has
some recommendations:
Page 7, line 8. The concentrations mentioned here don’t correspond to those reported in Figure 4.
Figure 7. Please, indicate who is solution for desorption test and in what proportion.
Page 8, line 1. You cite Table 3 and you should cite Table 2.
Page 28, line 29. The variable “c” should not be written as a subscript.

where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so

This manuscript reported an exploratory study on low concentration hexavalent
chromium adsorption by Fe(III)-crosslinked chitosan beads. It is interesting and
useful for wastewater treatment, especially for wastewater with low Cr6+
concentration. In my opinion, this manuscript can be accepted for publication after
some minor revisions below.
Response: We thank the Reviewer for supporting our work to be published in Royal
Society Open Science.
1. Some language errors have been found in this manuscript. For example, in the first
paragraph of introduction, “attentions have been paid on the development”, in this
phrase on should be replaced by to, attention is an uncountable noun, and it has no
plural form. “prevents its broad application”, first prevent is not a good word here,
constrain or limit is better. In addition, constraining or limiting should be used instead
of using constrain or limit. In methods section, as following should be as follows.
There are still other similar errors. Authors are suggested to proofread the language
again carefully.
Response: We thank the Referee for pointing out these grammatical mistakes and the
kind suggestion. In the process of being revised, all the grammatical mistakes you
pointed out were revised; meanwhile, several other mistakes we found were also
corrected. All the changes were marked in red in the revised manuscript.
2. It is good that authors provided detailed discussion on the experimental results.
However, I would like to advise authors to discuss its potential application in
wastewater treatment. How can these laboratory results be used in practice? Is its cost
high compared with other materials? How will its efficiency be if this approach is
used in practice? What kind of conditions does this approach require if it is used in
practice? I believe adding such contents in your paper will generate more interests to
our readers.
Response: We thank the Referee again for the very insightful advice.
Actually, as your advice, the objective of our research project aims to prepare several
environmentally-friendly and efficient adsorbents to purify low concentration Cr(VI)
water with pH value in 2.0~8.0, and understand their process characteristics and
mechanisms, and finally develop a water purifying plant. The present study just is a
part of the project. Out of the others, some will be reported in other manuscripts, and
some are still under study. We also hope all these are going well, and report more
interests to our readers. Thank you again for far-sighted advice.
3. Figure 3 has low resolution. Please provide a high resolution figure.
Response: The figure has been replaced by one high resolution figure (which was
shown in the revised manuscript).
4. All variables such as k, q, C, and K in tables should be in italic form.
Response: All the variables such as k, q, C, and K including the tables and figures
have been reformed into italic form in the revised manuscript.

Response: We thank the Reviewer for the positive comments.
Page 7, line 8. The concentrations mentioned here don’t correspond to those reported
in Figure 4.
Response: We are so sorry for that our words were not clear enough and resulted in
difficulty to understand them. Actually, the concentrations mentioned in Page 7, line 8,
are initial concentrations, and the concentrations reported in Figure 4 are, so the both
are in correspondence. To make it easier to understand, many words were added as
notes for Figure 4 in the revised manuscript. All the changes were marked in red in
the revised manuscript.
Figure 7. Please, indicate who is solution for desorption test and in what proportion.
Response: Thank you very much for reminding us. The information was added for all
the figures included Figure 7 in the revised manuscript.
Page 8, line 1. You cite Table 3 and you should cite Table 2.
Response: Thank you for pointing out this error. This is our mistake. There should be
Table 2, but Table 3. We have corrected it in the revised manuscript.
Page 28, line 29. The variable “c” should not be written as a subscript.
Response: This is our mistake. We have replaced “c” by “C” in Table 2 in the revised
manuscript.
