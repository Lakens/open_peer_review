The manuscript RSOS-171550 entitled ‘Effects of elevated carbon dioxide on male and female
behavioural lateralisation in a temperate goby’ tests the impact of elevated on male and female
lateralisation of the two-spotted goby. The study finds there is no impact of gender or the
interaction between gender and CO2 treatment. Yet, there is a weak impact on behavioural
asymmetry between the control and high CO2 treatments. While the experimental design appears
to be well designed, executed and analysed, the theoretical framework for the importance of the
research could be improved upon. As it reads now, the introduction would benefit from careful
editing improve the quality of the text
The introduction sets the study up to test the effect of gender and high CO2 on behavioural
lateralisation. In the background information, the potential implications of acclimation times
influencing patterns is not very well addressed (aside from lines 102 – 104). However, the
acclimation time of this study (~18 days) may be longer term relative to the majority of the CO2
literature and may also be novel context to present the research.
Specific comments:
Lines 34-36: Rephrase the sentence to be more explicit about the finding. For example: Regardless
of gender, fish elevated to high CO2 treatment were left biased in their behavioural asymmetry.
3
Line 52. Period after atmosphere. Start a new sentence with consequently.
Line 54. Revise to improve clarity.
Line 57. Add a comma after ‘effort’.
Lines 57-60: Another factor is acclimation time scales: short, long, life-long exposures and how
patterns observed may shift across exposure times.
Line 60: Add an ‘h’ between the t and o in ‘tough’ to read ‘though’.
Line 62: Revise ‘the possible effect of sex’ to clarify on what.
Line 67: Please define ‘cerebral lateralisation’ to make clear the relationship with behavioural
lateralisation.
Line 72: Period after versa. Start a new sentence with Therefore.
Line 83: Give a few examples of vertebrate species where males are more strongly lateralized.
Line 84: While there was no effect of gender in many studies – did they control for acclimation
time, life stage, and/or reproductive state? While there may be no difference in non-reproductive
times, the differences may be quite strong and from a life history perspective more important
during reproductively active states. Please revise to elaborate on this a bit more.
Line 86: State cichlid species here. Cichlids are known to have strong sexual dimorphisms. So
you might expect the differences in lateralisation to be more pronounced compared to other
species.
Lines 82-95: This is an important paragraph to justify the need for the study. It would benefit
from revision to elaborate a bit on what may be driving the differences between some species in
some studies, and no pattern in others (line 84) to make clear the justification for the research and
the hypothesis.
Lines 102-104: The justification of the species selected is a bit weak – is there clear sexual
dimorphism between genders in the two-spotted goby outside of the parental care period. What
time of year do the males nest guard? Would this be when the sexual dimorphism is strongest
where you might expect to see the clearest gender effect if present?. It makes sense to explore
these patterns in a wide spread species that may be adaptable to a range of habitats. But it might
be easier to detect if CO2 can influence lateralisation in a species with a more limited range and
very clear sexual dimorphism.
Line 105: Were the males and females mature or immature?
Line 118: Change ‘during’ to ‘over’
Line 127 – 130: Was CO2 monitored during this first acclimation period? If so, please state means
with the environmental variables monitored.
Line 135: Please expand on the first sentence a bit. ‘Method of CO2 exposure….’
Line 143: Please clarify if this was from natural or artificial seawater
Lines 178-182: Please justify why the ~18 day exposure period was selected? Please elaborate on
exposure times tests where no no difference in exposure duration was found (ref cited 17,39)
Line 224: Change ‘was’ to ‘were’ non-significant.
Line 236: Change ‘have’ to ‘has’.
Lines 236 – 244: The introduction and discussion of this paper is heavily geared to highlighting
the importance of sex in the absence of a difference between genders in the results. While this is
certainly an important contribution to the literature, it seems that placing the results into the
context of acclimation time would be another way to think about the patterns in the data and thus
may strength the interpretation of the results.
Lines 275 – 284: Would the discussion flow better if this paragraph was moved to follow the first
paragraph of the discussion? The discussion would flow from full discussion of gender results
into the interpretation of the CO2 results into conclusions.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
This ms tests the hypothesis that elevated CO2 may affect the behavioural lateralization of gobies
and, in addition, the possibility that such an effect may be modulated by the sex of each
individual. The paper is one of a series of papers by various authors on the effect of elevated
CO2 on lateralization. The main component that the ms adds, is the test of females vs males. The
paper is relatively clearly written, and the set up and the results are clearly presented. No effect
of sex was found, but this does not detract from the significance of the paper. I mainly have
comments on the data interpretation and the results, that should be taken into account by the
authors in order for the paper to be considered for publication. In addition, the authors should
include some simple additional analyses (see point 4 below).
1) One of my main comments relates to how this study can/should be compared to past work,
and the extent with which past work should be described in order to make this comparison more
relevant. Here are some specific examples
a) The authors claim that this is the first paper to test “Whether females and males marine fish
exposed to elevated CO2 differ in lateralization”. This is correct. However, there is some relevant
information missing here, that should be inserted at this point of the introduction. (i) There is past
work that tested whether females and males freshwater fish exposed to elevated CO2 differ in
lateralization (Vossen et al 2016). This paper is cited in the discussion, but should also be brought
up here. (ii) most previous work was carried out on larval and juvenile fish, hence the possibility
of testing the effect of female vs males was not really there.
b) Many previous papers tested fish species whose lateralization was not side-biased at the
population level, to start with. Clearly, there was no way that a stressor could have changed the
side bias in such populations, since there was no directional bias in the control situation at the
population level. This is something that needs to be clarified (in the discussion around lines 249-
259). The sentence (line 251) is therefore a bit misleading. Discussing previous work, the authors
wrote “with no effect on the turning direction bias”. However, in many of these previous papers,
there was no turning direction bias in the control situation, so there cannot be an effect on
changing a side-bias that is not there to start with.
c) Similarly (relevant to lines 249-255), the strength of individual lateralization (absolute
5
lateralization) of this species is quite low (around 30) , compared to many of the species studied
previously, on which CO2 had an effect (around 40-50). A values near 30 is close what one
expects from a random lateralization pattern , hence –again- it is hard to see how a stressor could
possibly have decreased the absolute lateralization of a fish that behaves like a random system.
2) Line 36 (abstract). The authors wrote “Although this effect was rather small, we obtained the
same results when the study was repeated”. It is not clear what is meant by “small” effect.
“Small” applied to an effect appears subjective. What is more important is if the effect is
significant or not. Are the authors referring to the effect of elevated CO2 on relative
lateralization? If so, and if the effect is significant (as it seems to be from the rest of the ms), the
authors should clarify this by simply stating if elevated CO2 significantly affected the side bias of
this species. (i.e. relative lateralization as defined by most previous work) .
3) End of the abstract. This conclusion is rather weak. As I stated above, the fact that the authors
found no effect of sex does not detract from the paper. However, here the authors conclude that ,
despite the fact that sex had no effect in this study, future research needs to incorporate the
possible effect of sex in acidification studies. While this is a reasonable suggestion, it is not a
suggestion that derives directly from the current results. Basically, by testing the effect of sex, the
authors had two possible outcomes (i) sex had an effect, in which case surely any authors would
have suggested that sex needs to be incorporated in future studies (ii), sex had no effect (which is
the case here). Clearly this results does not strongly support the idea that sex needs to be taken
into account. Although I agree that this does not mean that sex has to be discarded as a variable,
the authors could have proposed that the effect of males vs females should be taken into account
in a discussion paper, i.e. independent of the present results. However, doing so in a paper that
shows no effect of sex appears rather week. I suggest to leave such considerations in the
discussion, but they should be removed from the abstract.
4) Results: the authors wrote “the control treatment being slightly right biased”. The significance
of the side bias (left or right) should be tested against a “zero” expectation based on a one-sample
test as done in previous work, following Domenici et al (2014) and Bisazza et al (2000).
5) Discussion and introduction. Previous work has shown that stressed animals tend to use
mainly the right hemisphere (Rogers, appl animal behav sci. 2010). Here, as suggested by
Domenici et al (2014) who found similar results, it is therefore possible that the results are due to
a reversal from right turning bias when facing the barrier (suggesting left brain control) to left-
turning bias (suggesting right brain control) as a consequence of stress.
6) When discussing the potential biological relevance of this effect (lines 295-297), the authors
should add their discussion about left vs right eye use (lines 74-75 and also lines 201-272). It is
plausible that the shift in use of the left vs right eye may have an effect of how well the stimulus
is processed, since (as stated by the authors ) left and right eyes are used for different tasks. As a
result, it is plausible that a shift in the side bias may have some biological relevance.
7) Lines 77-81 and lines 105-110. Here the authors summarize the effect of elevated CO2 found in
previous work. They state that they will test if elevated CO2 may cause a reduction in relative
and /or absolute lateralization. One more possibility that needs to be specified here is that
relative lateralization may be reversed, which is that case of at least one paper (Domenici et al
2014) that showed no effect of elevated CO2 on the strength of the individual lateralization, but
reversed the side bias of the population. This previous result should be specified somewhere in
the introduction.

The paper is now much improved. I still have a few points that need to be addressed.
1) Abstract: The sentence “Regardless of gender, fish exposed to high CO2 were left biased in
their behavioral asymmetry”. This sentence does not fully clarify what the results show, because
there is no mention of the lateralization pattern in the control. The authors could change this
sentence as follow (for example) : “While the control fish were right-biased in their behavioral
asymmetry, exposure to high CO2 affected their lateralization, such that treated fish were left
biased regardless of their gender”
2) The use of the Wilcoxon test against zero, should be mentioned in the methods
3) Intro- the effect of high CO2 on absolute lateralization (though not in all studies) should be
brought up here.
4) Line 304. I assume this study is Lai et al 2015 (Cons Physiol.). If so, that study used 20 runs,
instead of 10 runs as in most other studies (including the present paper). The expected baseline
lateralization (as a random system, in line with what is typically found in fish exposed to high
CO2) depends on the number of runs, such that with 10 runs, one can expect an absolute
13
lateralization value around 26, while with 20 runs, the expectation is much lower (around 17). I
am not suggesting a long discussion about random expectations which is outside of the scope of
this paper. However, because if such baseline expectations, it follows that one cannot compare
the lateralization values obtained in a study using 20 runs, with the values obtained in studies
that used 10 runs. A lateralization value of 30 in a 20-run study, in other words, does not
correspond to a value of 30 in a study using 10 runs. A 20-run study in which the control
lateralization is 30 (as in Lai et al), has a lot of scope for decreasing its lateralization down to
random expectations, compared to a 10-run study with a control value of 30. Therefore I suggest
to delete the sentences relative to the study by Lai, for the sake of simplicity, otherwise the
discussion on what this value of 30 (from Lai et al 2015) means when compared to the
lateralization values observed 10-run studies, may become quite complex and outside the scope
of this paper. Hence I recommend deleting from “However, Lai et al …” to “it is possible to
detect a reduction in CO2 exposed fish”.
5) Line 297 “the effect of CO2 exposure appears to be different”. Here, this sentence is a little bit
misleading, because if a population is not side biased, there is no way that high CO2 can change
its bias, since there was no bias to start with. Rather than referring to different effects, the author
should stress the different starting conditions of the controls in various studies.

Manuscript ID – RSOS-171550
The manuscript ‘Effects of elevated carbon dioxide on male and female behavioural lateralisation in
a temperate goby’ is a well written and well-presented manuscript that could make a valuable
addition to the field of aquatic acidification, and specifically the impact of elevated pCO2 on fish
behaviour. However there are a number of queries that I feel need fully clarifying in order for the
methodology and statistical approach to be as transparent as possible, and to therefore ensure the
approach is scientifically robust, before the manuscript could be accepted. If these points are
clarified, and either appropriate justification presented for the approaches used or slight changes
made to the analysis, this manuscript could make a good addition to the field.
General comments:
The main points that need addressing are concerning clarification with the methods and statistical
approach, as I believe at present it is not possible to fully ascertain the scientific robustness of the
study, as well as directly compare differences/similarities between the two experimental years.
The main points that need clarification are:
Experimental acclimation – In year 1 it appears there are 4 header tanks (2 per treatment) feeding 4
exposure tanks (assumed with fish housed in mixed sexes?), however in year two it reads that
the 4 header tanks feed 8 exposure tanks (4 male and 4 female tanks with sexes housed
separately). Please clarify if this is the case and also explain why this changes. Equally density
appears to approximately halve in year two. If this is the case it needs to be made explicit as the
environment in which the males and female are exposed to in the two years would therefore be
very different (except for carbonate chemistry). Asides from the different acclimation times
(which are explained and justified) co-habitation in mixed sex vs single sex groups, as well as
stocking density, could have a significant influence on behaviour, particularly depending on life
stage used and point in the reproductive cycle, neither of which are clarified.
Behavioural manipulation – I appreciate this manuscript uses published techniques, however
justification is still required to clarify what measures were taken to ensure repeated netting of
individuals from an exposure tank did not influence the subsequent measures for animals later
tested from that same replicate tank (particularly where single sexes were targeted to be tested
at separate times during year 1 [i.e. day 12 and 18] presumably requiring greater effort for
capturing specific individuals as numbers of that sex decreased). Also was density maintained or
reducing during testing, which again possibly influences the levels of stress fish are
experiencing? Equally what measures were taken to ensure 1 minute was a sufficient recovery
post netting before beginning behavioural trails. Much debate is currently underway discussing
this important consideration and how it can influence the outcome and repeatability of
behavioural studies as the authors are no doubt aware. As one of the main conclusions is that
fish in high pCO2 may be sensing, and thus responding to, a more stressful environment the
level of stress fish experience on introduction to the chamber may impact measured responses
(possibly overriding any treatment based responses if not accounted for). Please clarify how 1
minute was determined and what observations were made to ensure this was representative of
as non-stressed a response as possible.
Behavioural manipulation – better clarification is required to just explain the process between
subsequent behavioural trials. Was the water changed each trial (presumably so), how was it
changed and where was the water taken from (presume header tank but if exposure tank it
could differ in pheromones based on mixed or single sexes, as well as density). It states fish
were transferred into a separate room blind in year two, clarification is needed to quantify
length of air exposure and how fish were transported just to reaffirm this process did not add
additional stress. And how did this differ year 1 to year 2.
Statistical analysis – I appreciate the logistical difficulties of running multiple exposure replicates for
climate change studies, particularly when considering treatment and sex based differences.
However, the level at which the treatment is applied is really during the experimental exposure.
Therefore my understanding from what is presented is this experiment has 12 replicate tanks (4
mixed sex in year 1 and 8 single sex in year 2), so when presenting the data you result in 4
replicate tanks at the level of sex*treatment, (if you accept that the mixed sex tanks in year 1
represents a replicate for both male and female). This distinction of the level at which the
exposure is applied is particularly key if fish in different years are housed in single or mixed sex
groups as the ensuing behavioural responses could be influenced by differences caused at a
tank level. Furthermore, I would argue that it is highly unlikely, and impossible to appropriately
rule out, that the fishes behaviour is not influenced by its preceding exposure (mixed/single sex,
density) given only 1 minute of recovery is permitted prior to behavioural trials are undertaken,
and thus fish from individual tanks should not really be treated as truly independent. Therefore
the data should arguably be analysed at tank level with the response variable averaged for all
individuals (or individuals of a sex) in that tank. As currently presented the general linear model
is testing for each of its main effects with 170 replicates rather than 12/16, significantly
increasing the power of the test as residual degrees of freedom are 164.
The authors need to either acknowledge this limitation, accept that this is in effect pseudo-
replication, and provide a strong statistical argument with appropriate evidence that tank does
not have a significant effect on data before proceeding with the analysis as it is, OR they need
to re-run statistical analysis at the appropriate tank level and present data accordingly. This
would result in a 2-way ANOVA (sex*treat), with tank being the replicate. Whilst not possible to
undertake this at present (tank origin is not presented in supplementary information), I have re-
run stats on data with sampled date as proxy for tank (see copy of supplementary info attached
to show test design in the second tab). I ran this very quickly in PERMANOVA (analogous to
ANOVA for univariate data) and the main effect of pCO2 remains for relative lateralisation
(which was the only test I ran). It is thus possible re-doing the stats may not have a major
bearing on the overall outcome of the paper (this would of course need to be confirmed with
appropriate stats) but would be more statistically robust based on the level at which the
treatment is applied (tank).
Specific minor comments:
Line 22: States ‘behavioural abnormality in fishes has been proposed as being one of the greatest
threats…’, I would argue this is slightly overstated. It is undeniably an impact with potentially
significant ecological consequences, but the variable results presented by the author show this
impact isn’t applicable to this entire group, and certainly not under climate change scenarios. Maybe
re-write as ‘….proposed as a significant threat of’
Line 38-41: I agree with this statement, and think it is important to include words to this effect
somewhere in the text, but would argue that considering sex-based differences is not a conclusion
derived from the data presented here, and therefore is not warranted as such in the abstract?
Maybe move to just before conclusions in main text discussion.
Line 62: Needs to read ‘effects of sex have…’ or ‘effect of sex has…’
Line 64: Need to subscript CO2
Line 78: Needs to read appears not appear
Line 79: Based on cited ratio of 7:2 for behavioural lateralisation, would ‘..the majority of’ not be
more appropriate than ‘..nearly all’?
Line 121: Rewrite ‘…caught during 3rd-8th May 2014, and 7th-8th June 2017.’
Line 152-154: Please provide details of how alkalinity was measured. Also, assume is using combined
glass electrode, please add this detail
Line 155: Please move pH/TA data derived during both years to table 1. I know pCO2 was measured
directly, and is the experimental factor of interest, however this will enable others to directly
compare results and experimental conditions with greater ease
Line 156: States pH and TA not explicitly needed, this is true in isolation, but critical for considering
study in light of other literature, as well as for considering possible implications of other carbonate
parameters
Line 158: pHNBS may be inadequate for monitoring temporal patterns of pCO2 variability in an open
ocean context, but is more than adequate for differentiating between treatments in an experimental
context (where pCO2 differences are larger than 100 µatm). Equally, a recent publication has
suggested pHNBS determine pCO2 with equal accuracy as spectrophotometric pHT and TA, as well as
directly measuring pCO2 using a NIDR gas analyser and CO2 equilibrator, if used correctly and
carefully (Watson et al 2017).
Line 236: Has not have
Line 257: I do not believe structure is required after benthic
Line 259: Also not laso
Line 279: has not have
Line 282: Ocean acidification is not incorrect, but equally could justify defining it as aquatic
acidification (see Ellis et al 2017). Study species is coastal/brackish, and acidification will occur in all
ocean, coastal, estuarine and freshwaters (just more dynamic in many non-open ocean ecosystems
as often against a background of greater natural variability in carbonate chemistry, and climate
change signal may be masked by this natural variability). Also, re-phrasing to aquatic acidification
may make the results more applicable to a wider scientific community working in freshwater or
aquaculture, beyond that of just the ocean acidification community.

General comments:
The main points that need addressing are concerning clarification with the methods and statistical
approach, as I believe at present it is not possible to fully ascertain the scientific robustness of the
study, as well as directly compare differences/similarities between the two experimental years.
The main points that need clarification are:
Experimental acclimation – In year 1 it appears there are 4 header tanks (2 per treatment) feeding
4 exposure tanks (assumed with fish housed in mixed sexes?), however in year two it reads that
the 4 header tanks feed 8 exposure tanks (4 male and 4 female tanks with sexes housed
separately). Please clarify if this is the case and also explain why this changes. Equally density
appears to approximately halve in year two. If this is the case it needs to be made explicit as the
environment in which the males and female are exposed to in the two years would therefore be
very different (except for carbonate chemistry). Asides from the different acclimation times
(which are explained and justified) co-habitation in mixed sex vs single sex groups, as well as
stocking density, could have a significant influence on behaviour, particularly depending on life
stage used and point in the reproductive cycle, neither of which are clarified.
Response: The reviewer is correct that there were 4 exposure tanks year one and 8 exposure
tanks year two. Both years, however, the fish were housed separated by sex. Since this was
not clear for year one, we have added this information (page 6, line 148). The setup changed
due to availability of tanks and space. In year one, we had access to slightly larger tanks
that could house more fish, in year two, each tank could not house as many fish as in year
one since the tanks were smaller. The density of fish per tank however remained similar
between years. We have added this information to the manuscript (page 6, line 151-154).
We agree with the reviewer that stock density may indeed have an effect on behaviour. If
the small difference in stocking density had an effect on behavioural lateralization, we
would have expected to see an effect of year, however year was non-significant in our
analyses. The fish used in the study were sexually mature, collected at the beginning of the
breeding season, this information has been added (page 5, line 115-117; 129; 131-132).
Behavioural manipulation – I appreciate this manuscript uses published techniques, however
justification is still required to clarify what measures were taken to ensure repeated netting of
individuals from an exposure tank did not influence the subsequent measures for animals later
2
tested from that same replicate tank (particularly where single sexes were targeted to be tested at
separate times during year 1 [i.e. day 12 and 18] presumably requiring greater effort for capturing
specific individuals as numbers of that sex decreased). Also was density maintained or reducing
during testing, which again possibly influences the levels of stress fish are experiencing? Equally
what measures were taken to ensure 1 minute was a sufficient recovery post netting before
beginning behavioural trails. Much debate is currently underway discussing this important
consideration and how it can influence the outcome and repeatability of behavioural studies as the
authors are no doubt aware. As one of the main conclusions is that fish in high pCO2 may be
sensing, and thus responding to, a more stressful environment the level of stress fish experience
on introduction to the chamber may impact measured responses (possibly overriding any
treatment based responses if not accounted for). Please clarify how 1 minute was determined and
what observations were made to ensure this was representative of as non-stressed a response as
possible.
Response: Since the fish were housed separated by sex both years, no greater effort for
capturing individuals of a specific sex (as numbers of that sex decreased) were required.
I.e., the effort to catch fish per tank was the same across sexes and CO2 treatments, we have
clarified that the fish were housed separated by sex also in year one at page 6, line 148.
Since the fish were not individually tagged and we used each fish only once, used fish could
not be returned to the exposure tank and placed together with unused fish. This led to
decreasing density in the exposure tanks during testing, which is very common in
behavioural experimentation in fish when not tagging the fish. Again, this was the same for
all exposure tanks, across sexes and CO2 treatments. We tested for an effect of order the
fish was sampled from the tanks, where the first fish were taken from high density and the
last fish from low density (and potentially increasing stress from netting), but order did not
significantly affect lateralised behaviour. This indicates that the density did not have a
major impact on the results of the current experiment. We have added this information to
the manuscript (page 8, line 190-192) as well as to the Electronic Supplementary Material.
We agree with the reviewer that fish are unlikely to regain normal unstressed behaviour
one minute after handling, and that behavioural observations should always strive for
enough acclimatisation time in behavioural arenas to allow full recovery. However, the
nature of the lateralisation test is that some degree of stress is inevitable because the
researcher is visible to the fish and the researcher is actively encouraging the fish to move
forward in the arena. Therefore, the actual trial is likely as stressful to the fish as the
handling prior to the test, meaning that further acclimatisation time wouldn’t affect the
stress levels during the actual test. Fortunately, two-spotted gobies appear stress tolerant
and do not show signs of extreme stress such as freezing or rapid erratic swimming, and are
often described as an excellent species for behavioural experiments in small arenas
(Forsgren et al., 2013 Ecol Evol). During method testing prior to starting the experiments,
longer acclimatisation times in the arena prior to lateralisation tests did not appear to alter
the behaviour of the gobies. For these reasons, we deemed one minute acclimatisation time
sufficient.

Behavioural manipulation – better clarification is required to just explain the process between
subsequent behavioural trials. Was the water changed each trial (presumably so), how was it
changed and where was the water taken from (presume header tank but if exposure tank it could
differ in pheromones based on mixed or single sexes, as well as density). It states fish were
transferred into a separate room blind in year two, clarification is needed to quantify length of air
exposure and how fish were transported just to reaffirm this process did not add additional stress.
And how did this differ year 1 to year 2.
Response: We used water from the respective header tank, this information has been added
(page 7, line 180-181). The water was changed in-between approximately every 10:th fish,
this information has been added (page 8, line 189-190). In addition, we tested whether there
was an effect of testing order within each water change, which was not found. We have
added this information to the manuscript (page 8, line 190-191) as well as to the Electronic
Supplementary Material. The water was changed in the lateralisation arena by carefully
flipping the arena on its side, pouring out the water. New water was added to the arena
from a bucket until a water depth of 6 cm was reached. We have added this information to
the Electronic Supplementary Material.
In year one, the lateralisation trials were performed in the same laboratory room as the fish
were exposed. The fish were carefully netted from their home tank and introduced into the
lateralisation arena, with minimum air-exposure of only a few seconds. In year two, the fish
were transported between two rooms in a bucket with water from their exposure tank. The
transportation time was less than one minute. This information has been added to the
manuscript (page 8, line 195-198) and detailed in the Electronic Supplementary Material.
Statistical analysis – I appreciate the logistical difficulties of running multiple exposure replicates
for climate change studies, particularly when considering treatment and sex based differences.
However, the level at which the treatment is applied is really during the experimental exposure.
Therefore my understanding from what is presented is this experiment has 12 replicate tanks (4
mixed sex in year 1 and 8 single sex in year 2), so when presenting the data you result in 4
replicate tanks at the level of sex*treatment, (if you accept that the mixed sex tanks in year 1
represents a replicate for both male and female). This distinction of the level at which the
exposure is applied is particularly key if fish in different years are housed in single or mixed sex
groups as the ensuing behavioural responses could be influenced by differences caused at a tank
level. Furthermore, I would argue that it is highly unlikely, and impossible to appropriately rule
out, that the fishes behaviour is not influenced by its preceding exposure (mixed/single sex,
density) given only 1 minute of recovery is permitted prior to behavioural trials are undertaken,
and thus fish from individual tanks should not really be treated as truly independent. Therefore
the data should arguably be analysed at tank level with the response variable averaged for all
individuals (or individuals of a sex) in that tank. As currently presented the general linear model
is testing for each of its main effects with 170 replicates rather than 12/16, significantly
increasing the power of the test as residual degrees of freedom are 164. The authors need to either
acknowledge this limitation, accept that this is in effect pseudo- replication, and provide a strong
4
statistical argument with appropriate evidence that tank does not have a significant effect on data
before proceeding with the analysis as it is, OR they need to re-run statistical analysis at the
appropriate tank level and present data accordingly. This would result in a 2-way ANOVA
(sex*treat), with tank being the replicate. Whilst not possible to undertake this at present (tank
origin is not presented in supplementary information), I have re- run stats on data with sampled
date as proxy for tank (see copy of supplementary info attached to show test design in the second
tab). I ran this very quickly in PERMANOVA (analogous to ANOVA for univariate data) and the
main effect of pCO2 remains for relative lateralisation (which was the only test I ran). It is thus
possible re-doing the stats may not have a major bearing on the overall outcome of the paper (this
would of course need to be confirmed with appropriate stats) but would be more statistically
robust based on the level at which the treatment is applied (tank).
Response: The reviewer is correct, we had 12 replicate exposure tanks (4 year one and 8
year two). The tanks were however single sex both years, which has been clarified (page 6,
line 148). As far as we understand, the main concern of the reviewer stems from the
reviewer’s interpretation that the fish were housed in mixed sex groups year one, and that
there was a great difference in densities between the years, which was not the case, and this
has been clarified in the manuscript (page 6, line 151-154). We apologise for the unclear
description of this in the original submission. Nonetheless, we agree with the reviewer that it
is important to test for tank effects. Since the data does not meet the assumptions of
ANOVA, we have not performed the analysis suggested by the reviewer (or for example a
nested ANOVA), but instead we re-ran the analyses and included tank as a random factor.
As reviewer 1 suggested based on their own analysis, controlling for tank did not change the
result of our study, and the effect of CO2 treatment remained for turning direction bias. We
have added this information to the manuscript (page 10, line 260-262). In addition, we
present the full results from the complementary analysis in Table S1 of the Electronic
Supplementary Material.
Specific minor comments:
Line 22: States ‘behavioural abnormality in fishes has been proposed as being one of the greatest
threats...’, I would argue this is slightly overstated. It is undeniably an impact with potentially
significant ecological consequences, but the variable results presented by the author show this
impact isn’t applicable to this entire group, and certainly not under climate change scenarios.
Maybe re-write as ‘....proposed as a significant threat of’
Response: Changed to: “proposed as a significant threat” (page 2, line 22).
Line 38-41: I agree with this statement, and think it is important to include words to this effect
somewhere in the text, but would argue that considering sex-based differences is not a conclusion
derived from the data presented here, and therefore is not warranted as such in the abstract?
Maybe move to just before conclusions in main text discussion.
Response: Statement moved to the discussion (page 13, line 341-343).

Line 78: Needs to read appears not appear
Response: Changed (page 4, line 77).

Line 121: Rewrite ‘...caught during 3 -8 May 2014, and 7 -8 June 2017.’
Response: Changed (page 5, line 131).
Line 152-154: Please provide details of how alkalinity was measured. Also, assume is using
combined glass electrode, please add this detail
Response: The Ocean Acidification lab at Kristineberg Marine Station, under the lead of Dr
Sam Dupont, has a standardised protocol for alkalinity measurements. We measured total
alkalinity with an accuracy of 10 µmol/kg-1 seawater (AT, mmol/kg) using an Eppendorf
Bio- 218 Photometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) according to (Sarazin G, Michard
G, Prevot F. A rapid and accurate spectroscopic method for alkalinity measurements in sea
water samples. J Water Res 1999;33:290e4.) This information has been added to the
manuscript (page 7, line 169-170)
Line 155: Please move pH/TA data derived during both years to table 1. I know pCO2 was
measured directly, and is the experimental factor of interest, however this will enable others to
directly compare results and experimental conditions with greater ease
Response: We have moved the alkalinity and pHNBS data to Table 1. In addition, we have
calculated pHtot and added this to Table 1.
Line 156: States pH and TA not explicitly needed, this is true in isolation, but critical for
considering study in light of other literature, as well as for considering possible implications of
other carbonate parameters
Response: We have added that these measurements allow for easier comparison to other
studies (page 7, line 172-173).

Line 158: pHNBS may be inadequate for monitoring temporal patterns of pCO2 variability in an
open ocean context, but is more than adequate for differentiating between treatments in an
experimental context (where pCO2 differences are larger than 100 µatm). Equally, a recent
publication has suggested pHNBS determine pCO2 with equal accuracy as spectrophotometric
pHT and TA, as well as directly measuring pCO2 using a NIDR gas analyser and CO2
equilibrator, if used correctly and carefully (Watson et al 2017).
Response: We agree with the reviewer that measuring pHNBS may deliver adequate
precision in some instances, as is claimed in the Watson et al. 2017 paper the reviewer refers
to. We have changed the sentence and it now reads that pHNBS measurements are generally
not considered adequate to accurately calculate pCO2 in seawater (page 7, line 174). The
best practices guidelines (Riebesell et al. 2010, Guide to best practices for ocean
acidification research and data reporting) for ocean acidification experiments is commonly
regarded as the gold standard which should be followed for CO2 perturbation experiments
in the lab. In a paper by Bockmon and Dickson (2015, Marine Chemistry), water samples
were sent to state-of-the-art laboratories around the world for pH measurements. They
found that measurements made with a pH probe were as far off as 0.1 pH units for the same
water sample. This is of great importance for many studies where several treatment levels
are used, with differences between the treatment groups of less than 0.1 pH units
(corresponding to ~100 µatm). This means that there is a risk that the treatment groups in
studies with multiple CO2 levels overlapped. We have carefully read the Watson et al. 2017
study that the reviewer refer to, and while it constitutes an interesting contribution to the
field of ocean acidification, it fails to cite and discuss the important Bockmon and Dickson
2015 paper (although other papers by Dickson are cited and discussed). The Watson paper
also fails to give information on what year, and more importantly, at which time of year, the
water samples were collected for their study, which makes it difficult to relate to other
studies. We agree, however, that when two treatment groups are tested (control and 1000
µatm), with a difference of >500 µatm between the groups, measuring pHNBS might be
sufficient, at least to ensure that treatment groups do not overlap. Even so, great caution
should be considered when using this method as an alternative to measurements of direct
pCO2, which is why we think our statement is an appropriate inclusion in this section of the
manuscript, right after mentioning the pHNBS measurements, to inform readers of the
inherent limitations. The difficulties with manipulation and measuring CO2 in seawater has
been discussed elsewhere (e.g., Clements and Hunt 2015 Mar Ecol Prog Ser; Moran 2014 J
Experiment Biol; Riebesell et al., 2010).

Line 282: Ocean acidification is not incorrect, but equally could justify defining it as aquatic
acidification (see Ellis et al 2017). Study species is coastal/brackish, and acidification will occur
in all ocean, coastal, estuarine and freshwaters (just more dynamic in many non-open ocean
ecosystems as often against a background of greater natural variability in carbonate chemistry,
and climate change signal may be masked by this natural variability). Also, re-phrasing to aquatic
acidification may make the results more applicable to a wider scientific community working in
freshwater or aquaculture, beyond that of just the ocean acidification community.
Response: We agree, and have changed to “aquatic acidification” (page 11, line 285).

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_11
The manuscript RSOS-171550 entitled ‘Effects of elevated carbon dioxide on male and female
behavioural lateralisation in a temperate goby’ tests the impact of elevated on male and female
lateralisation of the two-spotted goby. The study finds there is no impact of gender or the
interaction between gender and CO2 treatment. Yet, there is a weak impact on behavioural
asymmetry between the control and high CO2 treatments. While the experimental design appears
to be well designed, executed and analysed, the theoretical framework for the importance of the
research could be improved upon. As it reads now, the introduction would benefit from careful
editing improve the quality of the text. The introduction sets the study up to test the effect of
gender and high CO2 on behavioural lateralisation. In the background information, the potential
implications of acclimation times influencing patterns is not very well addressed (aside from lines
102 – 104). However, the acclimation time of this study (~18 days) may be longer term relative to
the majority of the CO2 literature and may also be novel context to present the research.
Response: We thank the reviewer for complementing our work as being well designed,
executed and analysed. We have followed the reviewer’s suggestions to improve the
theoretical framework of our study. The introduction deals mainly with CO2 and possible
differences between the sexes, since testing these factors was the aim of the study and what
the experiements were designed to test. The study did not set out to test the possible
implications of acclimation/exposure duration, which would have required testing males
and females from both treatments during several different lengths of exposure. We agree
with the reviewer that the exposure duration used here (~18 days) is longer compared to
8
many studies on CO2 and lateralisation. However, this is not true for all studies, as some
used similar exposure durations as used here, or longer. Nonetheless, we have added to the
introduction that the variability in response to elevated CO2 may be due to acclimation
times and that patterns may shift across exposure times (page 3, line 54-55). It is an
interesting venue for future research to investigate the possible effect of
acclimation/exposure duration on behavioural lateralisation.
Specific comments:
Lines 34-36: Rephrase the sentence to be more explicit about the finding. For example:
Regardless of gender, fish elevated to high CO2 treatment were left biased in their behavioural
asymmetry.
Response: Changed to: “Regardless of gender, fish exposed to high CO2 were left biased in
their behavioural asymmetry, while the strength of the side bias was unaffected by CO2
treatment” (page 2, line 32-33).
Line 52. Period after atmosphere. Start a new sentence with consequently.
Response: Changed (page 2, line 46).
Line 54. Revise to improve clarity.
Response: The sentence has been rewritten for clarity (page 2-3, line 47-49).
Line 57. Add a comma after ‘effort’.
Response: Added (page 3, line 51).
Lines 57-60: Another factor is acclimation time scales: short, long, life-long exposures and how
patterns observed may shift across exposure times.
Response: We have added that the variability may also be due to acclimation times and that
patterns may shift across exposure times (page 3, line 54-55).
Line 60: Add an ‘h’ between the t and o in ‘tough’ to read ‘though’.
Response: Changed (page 3, line 56).
Line 62: Revise ‘the possible effect of sex’ to clarify on what.
Response: We have added “on responses to elevated CO2” to clarify (page 3, line 58).
Line 67: Please define ‘cerebral lateralisation’ to make clear the relationship with behavioural
lateralisation.
Response: Definition has been added and the relationship between cerebral lateralisation
and behavioural lateralisation has been clarified (page 3, line 64; 66-67).
Line 72: Period after versa. Start a new sentence with Therefore.
Response: Changed (page 3, line 71).
9
Line 83: Give a few examples of vertebrate species where males are more strongly lateralized.
Response: This sentence referred to humans, we have clarified this and in addition added
that in certain species of fish (e.g., zebrafish), males are more strongly lateralised than
females (page 4, line 82-83).
Line 84: While there was no effect of gender in many studies – did they control for acclimation
time, life stage, and/or reproductive state? While there may be no difference in non-reproductive
times, the differences may be quite strong and from a life history perspective more important
during reproductively active states. Please revise to elaborate on this a bit more.
Response: We have clarified that the no-effect of gender might be condition dependent and
added that life stage and/or reproductive state might change whether males and females
differ in lateralisation (page 4, line 84-88).
Line 86: State cichlid species here. Cichlids are known to have strong sexual dimorphisms. So
you might expect the differences in lateralisation to be more pronounced compared to other
species.
Response: We agree, strong sexual dimorphism should make differences in lateralisation
more likely. The species name has been added (convict cichlid, Archocentrus nigrofasciatus,
page 4, line 90).
Lines 82-95: This is an important paragraph to justify the need for the study. It would benefit
from revision to elaborate a bit on what may be driving the differences between some species in
some studies, and no pattern in others (line 84) to make clear the justification for the research and
the hypothesis.
Response: We agree, and we have rewritten the paragraph and added further justification,
e.g. sexual dimorphism increasing sex differences during reproductive periods, and that
many previous studies used larval fish or small juveniles that were impossible to sex (page
4, line 81-102).
Lines 102-104: The justification of the species selected is a bit weak – is there clear sexual
dimorphism between genders in the two-spotted goby outside of the parental care period. What
time of year do the males nest guard? Would this be when the sexual dimorphism is strongest
where you might expect to see the clearest gender effect if present?. It makes sense to explore
these patterns in a wide spread species that may be adaptable to a range of habitats. But it might
be easier to detect if CO2 can influence lateralisation in a species with a more limited range and
very clear sexual dimorphism.
Response: The two-spotted goby exhibits clear sexual dimorphism during the reproductive
season, which is the time of year when the study was performed. The males nest-guard
during the mating season, from May to July. We agree with the reviewer that the
reproductive season, when the sexual dimorphism is strongest, is most likely the time when
the clearest gender effects might be seen. This information has been added to the
manuscript (page 5, line 111-113; 115-117).
Line 105: Were the males and females mature or immature?
10
Response: The fish were sexually mature, this information has been added (page 5, line 113;
129).
Line 118: Change ‘during’ to ‘over’
Response: Changed (page 5, line 128).
Line 127 – 130: Was CO2 monitored during this first acclimation period? If so, please state
means with the environmental variables monitored.
Response: CO2 was not monitored during the few days of initial holding. However, as the
system used flow-through seawater the CO2 values during this period would have been
similar to those reported from the control tanks during the exposure period.
Line 135: Please expand on the first sentence a bit. ‘Method of CO2 exposure….’
Response: We have rephrased the sentence and it now reads: “Methods of CO2 manipulation
during the exposure were similar to those described in [24]” (page 6, line 146). The specific
method is then described in the rest of the paragraph (page 6-7, line 146-166).
Line 143: Please clarify if this was from natural or artificial seawater
Response: It was natural seawater and this has been clarified, page 6, line 157.
Lines 178-182: Please justify why the ~18 day exposure period was selected? Please elaborate on
exposure times tests where no difference in exposure duration was found (ref cited 17,39)
Response: The minimum 18-day exposure period was selected since previous studies have
detected behavioural effects of CO2 exposure after similar exposure durations, this has been
added to the manuscript (page 8, line 203-206). We have clarified that no effect of exposure
duration on effect size was reported in a meta-analysis of several taxa, including fish (page
8, line 206-208).
Line 224: Change ‘was’ to ‘were’ non-significant.
Response: Changed (page 10, line 252).
Line 236: Change ‘have’ to ‘has’.
Response: Changed (page 10, line 266).
Lines 236 – 244: The introduction and discussion of this paper is heavily geared to highlighting
the importance of sex in the absence of a difference between genders in the results. While this is
certainly an important contribution to the literature, it seems that placing the results into the
context of acclimation time would be another way to think about the patterns in the data and thus
may strength the interpretation of the results.
Response: We designed the study to investigate the possible difference between males and
females in response to elevated CO2 by investigating behavioural lateralisation. Therefore,
the introduction and discussion naturally reflect the importance of sex. Even if we did not
detect a difference between the sexes, it would be scientifically incorrect to place the results
11
in the contexts of acclimation time, as suggested by the reviewer, when this was not the
purpose of the study. The reviewer suggested that this would be: “another way to think
about the patterns in the data and thus may strength the interpretation of the results”.
However, we did not find a significant effect of year meaning that there was no effect of
exposure duration, and hence no such pattern in our data. Nonetheless, we agree that
exposure time is likely important and needs to be investigated further, but in experiments
properly designed to test for such effects. We have added to the introduction that the
variability in response to elevated CO2 may be due to acclimation times and that patterns
may shift across exposure times (page 3, line 54-55).
Lines 275 – 284: Would the discussion flow better if this paragraph was moved to follow the first
paragraph of the discussion? The discussion would flow from full discussion of gender results
into the interpretation of the CO2 results into conclusions.
Response: We agree that this is a more logical order. We have moved the paragraph as
suggested by the reviewer (page 11, line 278-287).

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_12
This ms tests the hypothesis that elevated CO2 may affect the behavioural lateralization of gobies
and, in addition, the possibility that such an effect may be modulated by the sex of each
individual. The paper is one of a series of papers by various authors on the effect of elevated CO2
on lateralization. The main component that the ms adds, is the test of females vs males. The paper
is relatively clearly written, and the set up and the results are clearly presented. No effect of sex
was found, but this does not detract from the significance of the paper. I mainly have comments
on the data interpretation and the results, that should be taken into account by the authors in order
for the paper to be considered for publication. In addition, the authors should include some simple
additional analyses (see point 4 below).
1) One of my main comments relates to how this study can/should be compared to past
work, and the extent with which past work should be described in order to make this comparison
more relevant. Here are some specific examples
a) The authors claim that this is the first paper to test “Whether females and males marine
fish exposed to elevated CO2 differ in lateralization”. This is correct. However, there is some
relevant information missing here, that should be inserted at this point of the introduction. (i)
There is past work that tested whether females and males freshwater fish exposed to elevated
CO2 differ in lateralization (Vossen et al 2016). This paper is cited in the discussion, but should
also be brought up here. (ii) most previous work was carried out on larval and juvenile fish, hence
the possibility of testing the effect of female vs males was not really there.
Response: We have clarified that many previous studies were done using larval fish, and
highlighted that there is one study on freshwater fish (page 4, line 98-101).
b) Many previous papers tested fish species whose lateralization was not side-biased at the
population level, to start with. Clearly, there was no way that a stressor could have changed the
side bias in such populations, since there was no directional bias in the control situation at the
population level. This is something that needs to be clarified (in the discussion around lines 249-
259). The sentence (line 251) is therefore a bit misleading. Discussing previous work, the authors
12
wrote “with no effect on the turning direction bias”. However, in many of these previous papers,
there was no turning direction bias in the control situation, so there cannot be an effect on
changing a side-bias that is not there to start with.
Response: We agree and have changed the sentence in accordance to the comment from the
reviewer. It now reads: “In other species of fish, with no side bias in the control group at the
population level, the effect of CO2 exposure appears to be different, with a reduced strength of
the bias [16-18, 21]” (page 11, line 295-296).
c) Similarly (relevant to lines 249-255), the strength of individual lateralization (absolute
lateralization) of this species is quite low (around 30), compared to many of the species studied
previously, on which CO2 had an effect (around 40-50). A values near 30 is close what one
expects from a random lateralization pattern, hence –again- it is hard to see how a stressor could
possibly have decreased the absolute lateralization of a fish that behaves like a random system.
Response: We agree with the reviewer that many previous studies report absolute
lateralisation values around 40-50, and that low values may potentially imply that a stressor
cannot lower the values even more, this has been added to the discussion (page 11-12, line
300-303). There are however studies where CO2 effects have been found when the control
fish had similar absolute values as in our study. For example Lai et al. 2016 reported an
absolute lateralisation value for control fish of 33.3, and that CO2 exposed fish had a
significantly lowered absolute lateralisation (13.8). Hence, even at relatively low absolute
values around 30, as in our study, it is possible to see a reduction in CO2 exposed fish. This
has been added to the discussion (page 12, line 303-306).
2) Line 36 (abstract). The authors wrote “Although this effect was rather small, we obtained
the same results when the study was repeated”. It is not clear what is meant by “small” effect.
“Small” applied to an effect appears subjective. What is more important is if the effect is
significant or not. Are the authors referring to the effect of elevated CO2 on relative
lateralization? If so, and if the effect is significant (as it seems to be from the rest of the ms), the
authors should clarify this by simply stating if elevated CO2 significantly affected the side bias of
this species. (i.e. relative lateralization as defined by most previous work) .
Response: In accordance with the suggestion from the reviewer, we have deleted the word
“small” and the sentence now reads: “The significant effect of CO2 on the side bias was
obtained yet again when the study was repeated” (page 2, line 34).
3) End of the abstract. This conclusion is rather weak. As I stated above, the fact that the
authors found no effect of sex does not detract from the paper. However, here the authors
conclude that , despite the fact that sex had no effect in this study, future research needs to
incorporate the possible effect of sex in acidification studies. While this is a reasonable
suggestion, it is not a suggestion that derives directly from the current results. Basically, by
testing the effect of sex, the authors had two possible outcomes (i) sex had an effect, in which
case surely any authors would have suggested that sex needs to be incorporated in future studies
(ii), sex had no effect (which is the case here). Clearly this results does not strongly support the
idea that sex needs to be taken into account. Although I agree that this does not mean that sex has
to be discarded as a variable, the authors could have proposed that the effect of males vs females
should be taken into account in a discussion paper, i.e. independent of the present results.
However, doing so in a paper that shows no effect of sex appears rather week. I suggest to leave
such considerations in the discussion, but they should be removed from the abstract.

Response: The reviewer is correct and the last sentence of the abstract has been moved to
the discussion where it fits better (page 13, line 341-343).
4) Results: the authors wrote “the control treatment being slightly right biased”. The
significance of the side bias (left or right) should be tested against a “zero” expectation based on a
one-sample test as done in previous work, following Domenici et al (2014) and Bisazza et al
(2000).
Response: This is an excellent suggestion. We have deleted the word “slightly” and tested
the relative lateralisation indexes against an expected mean of 0 and added this to the result
section (page 10, lines 249-251).
5) Discussion and introduction. Previous work has shown that stressed animals tend to use
mainly the right hemisphere (Rogers, appl animal behav sci. 2010). Here, as suggested by
Domenici et al (2014) who found similar results, it is therefore possible that the results are due to
a reversal from right turning bias when facing the barrier (suggesting left brain control) to left-
turning bias (suggesting right brain control) as a consequence of stress.
Response: We have added that stressed animals rely on the right hemisphere of the brain
and that the shift in eye use found in our study and by Domenici et al. 2014 might be a stress
response to elevated CO2 (page 11, line 290-295).
6) When discussing the potential biological relevance of this effect (lines 295-297), the
authors should add their discussion about left vs right eye use (lines 74-75 and also lines 201-
272). It is plausible that the shift in use of the left vs right eye may have an effect of how well the
stimulus is processed, since (as stated by the authors ) left and right eyes are used for different
tasks. As a result, it is plausible that a shift in the side bias may have some biological relevance.
Response: We have added to the discussion that a shift in eye use may have biological
relevance since it has been suggested the left and right eyes are used for different tasks
(page 13, line 337-339).
7) Lines 77-81 and lines 105-110. Here the authors summarize the effect of elevated CO2
found in previous work. They state that they will test if elevated CO2 may cause a reduction in
relative and /or absolute lateralization. One more possibility that needs to be specified here is that
relative lateralization may be reversed, which is that case of at least one paper (Domenici et al
2014) that showed no effect of elevated CO2 on the strength of the individual lateralization, but
reversed the side bias of the population. This previous result should be specified somewhere in
the introduction.
Response: We did cite the Domenici et al. 2014 paper in the introduction (originally on line
80), nonetheless we have highlighted that this study showed that relative lateralisation was
reversed (page 4, line 79). Our hypothesis was that CO2 would reduce the relative and/or
absolute lateralisation since this has been shown in the majority of previous studies. The
reversal of relative lateralisation found in the Domenici et al. 2014 study was not used as
basis for our hypothesis since it is the only study that found that specific result. This finding
is however discussed on page 11, line 290-292.

The authors have done a good job incorporating the comments from each of the reviewers and
I feel this adds clarity to the manuscript regarding the research, and addresses the concerns I
had initially regarding the statistics. I therefore have no reservations is recommending the
article for publication as is, with very few typos outlined below.
Response: We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment of our revised
manuscript.
Minor edits:

The paper is now much improved. I still have a few points that need to be addressed.
Response: We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment of our revised
manuscript.
1) Abstract: The sentence “Regardless of gender, fish exposed to high CO2 were left biased in
their behavioral asymmetry”. This sentence does not fully clarify what the results show,
because there is no mention of the lateralization pattern in the control. The authors could
change this sentence as follow (for example) : “While the control fish were right-biased in
their behavioral asymmetry, exposure to high CO2 affected their lateralization, such that
treated fish were left biased regardless of their gender”
Response: We have changed the sentence in accordance to the suggestion by the
reviewer, and clarified what our results showed by adding the mean relative
lateralization value for control and CO2 exposed fish (page 2, line 34-37).
2) The use of the Wilcoxon test against zero, should be mentioned in the methods
Response: We have added a description of the Wilcoxon test in the data analysis section
of the methods (page 9, line 233-235).
3) Intro- the effect of high CO2 on absolute lateralization (though not in all studies) should
be brought up here.
Response: We have added to the introduction that CO2 can have an effect of absolute
lateralization (page 4, line 82).
4) Line 304. I assume this study is Lai et al 2015 (Cons Physiol.). If so, that study used 20
runs, instead of 10 runs as in most other studies (including the present paper). The expected
baseline lateralization (as a random system, in line with what is typically found in fish
exposed to high CO2) depends on the number of runs, such that with 10 runs, one can expect
an absolute lateralization value around 26, while with 20 runs, the expectation is much lower
(around 17). I am not suggesting a long discussion about random expectations which is
outside of the scope of this paper. However, because if such baseline expectations, it follows
that one cannot compare the lateralization values obtained in a study using 20 runs, with the
values obtained in studies that used 10 runs. A lateralization value of 30 in a 20-run study, in
other words, does not correspond to a value of 30 in a study using 10 runs. A 20-run study in
which the control lateralization is 30 (as in Lai et al), has a lot of scope for decreasing its
lateralization down to random expectations, compared to a 10-run study with a control value
of 30. Therefore I suggest to delete the sentences relative to the study by Lai, for the sake of
simplicity, otherwise the discussion on what this value of 30 (from Lai et al 2015) means
when compared to the lateralization values observed 10-run studies, may become quite
complex and outside the scope of this paper. Hence I recommend deleting from “However,
Lai et al …” to “it is possible to detect a reduction in CO2 exposed fish”.
Response: We indeed meant to refer to the Lai et al. 2015 study, and the year 2016 has
been changed to 2015 (page 12, line 310; 313). We agree with the reviewer that this
study cannot be directly compared since they used 20 runs instead of 10. We have
clarified this, and added that the absolute lateralization expectancy is lower due to the
usage of 20 runs instead of 10 (page 12, line 313-315).
5) Line 297 “the effect of CO2 exposure appears to be different”. Here, this sentence is a little
bit misleading, because if a population is not side biased, there is no way that high CO2 can
change its bias, since there was no bias to start with. Rather than referring to different effects,
the author should stress the different starting conditions of the controls in various studies.
Response: While we agree with the reviewer, we do stress the starting condition in
controls, and this sentence start with the statement “with no side bias in the control
group” (see page 12, line 303). Nevertheless we have reworded the sentence and deleted
“appears to be different” and the sentence now reads: “In other species of fish, with no
side bias in the control group at the population level, CO2 exposure has been reported to
reduce the strength of the bias [16-18, 21]” (page 12, line 302-304).
