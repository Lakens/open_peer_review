The authors address the question of temporal primacy of two cortical brain regions implied in
stopping of actions. They use MEG and TMS and a variety of complementary analyses to address
the question. Contrary to recent suggestions, they find that both brain regions are likely acting
concurrently, and that there is no clear indication of temporal primacy.
The study is pre-registered and well conducted. It is a nice blueprint on how to conduct and
report such studies, and therefore I have no specific comments to the methods or results. The
latter are clear, and the authors discuss these carefully, in light of their own results. The
contribution is relevant given the ongoing debate about the specific roles different brain regions
play in the termination of actions.
Minor comments
These comments are not essential. I leave it to the discretion of the authors to answer these in
their revision.
While I broadly agree about the timings of the TMS study, and the rationale given for this, I
would like to hear the author’s view on some findings that might be relevant.
Visual information can reach motor regions extremely fast (see eg Ledberg et al Cereb Cort 2006).
Similarly, work by eg Day and others suggests that very fast adjustments to action can occur,
likely through subcortical control, which suggest an important component of visuomotor control
is non-cortical.
This may be relevant in terms of the possible times at which the cortical regions studied here
could possibly be relevant; but it also leaves open the possibility that neither makes a primary, or
sufficient contribution. In other words, there may well be an alternative (fast) pathway, and/or a
mediating region. In other words, while elegant, can the experiment really establish the causal
order A-B or B-A, when there is a possible alternative C?
I would like to hear the authors thoughts on this – acknowledging that I am no expert and do not
know the answer myself.
Recent work by Haith and Krakauer and others have reignited debate about the reaction time. I
think this work may also be relevant here, since the authors touch upon preparatory and
executive processes and their relative timings.
Now the authors alert to some of these options in their discussion, but I wonder whether they
really had the strictly serial hypothesis in mind to begin with?
Participants:
The rationale for the number of participants is given in the analysis section (Bayesian difference
tests) .It may be helpful for a reader to be explicitly referred to this in the participant section.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This study investigated the relative timing of the recruitment of the pre-SMA and IFC in
stopping. MEG was recorded during the performance of the stop task, and a temporal ROI was
defined for each individual participant to capture the time during which stopping was expected
to occur. Activity changes within this tROI were extracted for IFC and pre-SMA regions.
Anatomically guided dual-coil TMS was then administered first over IFC and then pre-SMA, or
in the reverse order, during the stopping interval, within the tROI. The MEG analyses revealed
no clear differences between the timing of activity changes within pre-SMA and IFC during
stopping. The order of TMS administration to these two regions did not show a difference either,
with both TMS orders increasing SSRT to an equivalent degree.
What order events take place within the brain network for stopping is an interesting question.
This study adopted a creative approach to address this question, and the results make a
compelling case for the parallel recruitment of pre-SMA and IFC. Some details of the
experimental design and choices for data analysis should be clarified. Moreover, the authors did
an admirable job of adhering to their pre-registered plan.
Major Comments:
1. Would it have been possible to use MEG signals associated with stop signal perception and
motor response output to individually tailor the tROI based upon neurophysiological markers
instead of using fixed 50 ms intervals to account for perceptual and motoric processes?
2. What was the justification for the TMS inter-pulse interval that was used? Might the results
change with a shorter or longer interval? Can the authors please include a justification in section
3.4.3?
3. What are potential consequences of using a variable duration for the fixation period in the TMS
phase of the study and a fixed duration during the MEG phase? Could this aspect of the task
design have introduced performance differences during the two phases? Additionally, could the
fixed interval used in the MEG phase have influenced the baseline activity? Anticipation during
this interval was likely related to preparing for the Go stimulus, and the underlying activity may
share stronger associations with Go processes than stop processes given the proportion of Go
relative to Stop trials in the task.
4. For the induced component analysis in section 3.3.5, did the Gaussian model fit allow for more
than one peak per frequency range? If only one peak was used, what was the justification for
restricting the analysis to a single peak?
4
5. In the opening paragraph of the Discussion, the authors suggest the TMS findings could reflect
ongoing interplay between pre-SMA and IFC. Is it known whether TMS to both regions impairs
stopping more than a single pulse to one region alone? Could TMS administered any time during
the tROI to just one of these regions equally explain the results? In other words, pulsing only the
pre-SMA early or late in the tROI, or pulsing only the IFC early or late in the tROI might equally
disrupt stopping performance. In this scenario, it seems that the approach used here might not
address the question about relative order as intended.
Minor Comments:
1. Given the race model and the results of De Jong et al. (1990), is it sound to assume the motoric
periods of stopping take at least 50 ms? In order for a stop process to head off a Go process, the
stop process would need to execute faster than motor responses in the peripheral nervous system.
2. How far away were the MEG guided TMS targets from the atlas guided targets used for the
distance adjustment procedure?
3. I spotted several typos. The manuscript would benefit from a careful proofreading. Just a
couple I noted: page 5, line 30 “was then be used” should be “was then used”; page 20, line 46
“design” should be “designed” and “drafterd” should be “drafted”.

Response to Reviews
Ref: RSOS-171369
Review 1.
We thank the reviewer for a well-considered and insightful review.
The review raises the possibility of an alternative, potentially sub-cortical, fast pathway mediating the
response inhibition process. We completely accept this possibility and think that this is, in part, a
‘third variable problem’. That is, whenever a correlation is observed between two variables it is never
logically possible to rule out there being a third unexamined mediating variable underling their
relationship. We have made an addition to the Discussion section to emphasise this possibility. Also
in line with the reviewer’s suggestions, we think it likely that sub-cortical regions do make an
important and critical contribution to the stopping process (e.g. Nambu et al., 2002, Neurosci Res,
43(2):111-7). In addition, we believe that the cognitive and perceptual demands of the stop signal task
necessitate a partly cortical response which this experiment aimed to capture and manipulate.
We have also added a sentence linking the number of participants to the Bayesian difference tests, in
the participants section, following the helpful suggestion made by the reviewer.
Following the reviewers’ suggestions, Figure 5 now features within-participant standard error bars in
addition to the individual data points previously presented.
Review 2.
We thank the reviewer for this detailed, thorough and well-informed review. Below we respond to
each of the points raised.
“1. Would it have been possible to use MEG signals associated with stop signal perception and motor response
output to individually tailor the tROI based upon neurophysiological markers instead of using fixed 50 ms
intervals to account for perceptual and motoric processes?”
The reviewer makes an interesting suggestion of tailoring the discounted motoric and perceptual
stages, which flank participants’ tROI, to individual participants. The speed and the pathways
involved in afferent transfer to the anatomical regions of interest is unclear and a matter of debate. For
example, some information may bypass primary visual areas directly innovating frontal regions of
interest (e.g. Ledberg et al., Cereb Cortex, 2007,17(1):44-62. Bar, 2003, J Cogn Neurosci, 15(4):600-
9). Therefore, assessing an informative time course on a participant level would have almost certainly
been beyond the possible scope of this experiment. Estimating peripheral transmission time is an
intriguing suggestion, which we are grateful for and may utilise in future investigations, potentially in
combination with TMS and electromyographic analyses of transmission speeds. Here, it is not
possible to obtain this information from participants and amend the analyses. Furthermore, the
interrelationship between stop-signals and the commonly observed MEG motoric desynchronisations
would have to be investigated in order for the information to be used in the manner suggested. This
would also be an interesting but lengthy investigation in-of-itself. We also note that the 50ms is a
conservative estimate based on previous research (e.g. Rothwell et al., 1987, Brain,110 (5):1173-90)
and variation at the later end of tROI is not likely to have made a substantive difference to the
findings as estimates of regional activity were far closer to the start of the tROI. Furthermore, re-
analysing the MEG data would result in a misalignment between the tROI used in the TMS section
and that employed in any MEG re-analysis, making interpretation difficult.

“2. What was the justification for the TMS inter-pulse interval that was used? Might the results change with a
shorter or longer interval? Can the authors please include a justification in section 3.4.3?”
The choice of when to apply the TMS involved balancing several factors and it is quite possible that
changing the interval could have affected the results. The first consideration was that the TMS should
only be applied when it was theoretically likely that either region could affect the response inhibition
process, that is, within the tROI as described in 3.2.1. The second consideration was the aim to have
the pulses far enough apart to be capable of differentially affecting the processes and regions in
question. Third, effects of TMS carry forward in time, which suggests placement of both pulses
earlier in the tROI. Finally, if pulses were too early or too late it is quite possible that they would not
have affected the processes of interest. We considered the 1/8th and 5/8th design to balance these
considerations. We have amended the requested section 3.4.3 with a brief description of these
considerations, emphasising the balance between efficacy and independence of the conditions.
“3. What are potential consequences of using a variable duration for the fixation period in the TMS phase of the
study and a fixed duration during the MEG phase? Could this aspect of the task design have introduced
performance differences during the two phases? Additionally, could the fixed interval used in the MEG phase
have influenced the baseline activity? Anticipation during this interval was likely related to preparing for the
Go stimulus, and the underlying activity may share stronger associations with Go processes than stop processes
given the proportion of Go relative to Stop trials in the task.”
As the reviewer points out it is possible that the fixed inter-trial interval of the MEG section could
have potentially led to relatively increased anticipation. However, if this were the case we might
expect the reaction time to be lower in the in the MEG experiment in comparison to the TMS section
and it was not. Rather they were comparable and the mean difference was in the opposite direction.
For the MEG section, reaction time on 'Go' trials was 428 (60) ms (mean ±SD) and the reaction time
on failed 'Stop' trials was 386 (34) ms. In the TMS baseline condition on 'Go' trials 419 (54) ms and
on failed 'Stop' trials it was 375 (35) ms. We had considered the option of applying variable intervals
within MEG experiment to bring it into line with the TMS experiment. However, as with the SSD
variability, the decision was made to maintain a consistent temporal structure for the MEG section to
improve data quality for the MEG analyses by reducing sources of variability.
“4. For the induced component analysis in section 3.3.5, did the Gaussian model fit allow for more than one
peak per frequency range? If only one peak was used, what was the justification for restricting the analysis to a
single peak?”
The possibly to applying multiple Gaussian peaks was also something we had considered prior to
registering this experiment. However, we felt this might overly complicate the analyses and reduce
the interpretability of the results. For instance, what if one peak in one region preceded that of another
region, but a different peak, within the same broad frequency band showed the opposite results? If the
solution gave rise to two peaks in one region and not the other, or differed across participants, then
how would the analyses be applied? These contingences, which must be fully considered within a pre-
registered design, would have compromised our ability to make clear predictions about the possible
outcome of the analyses. We therefore took the discussion to base our analyses on the classic
frequency bands that have previously been linked to cognitive inhibition processes. At the same time
the model fitting approach allowed for a level of objective flexibility to accommodate individual
cortical responses, which is rarely employed, especially with a pre-registered design. We do however
acknowledge that the existence of functional frequency bands within and straddling commonly
accepted frequency bands is an intriguing area of ongoing research, the development of which could
affect future experiments of this sort (see e.g. Ronconi et al., PNAS, 2017, early edition).
“5. In the opening paragraph of the Discussion, the authors suggest the TMS findings could reflect ongoing
interplay between pre-SMA and IFC. Is it known whether TMS to both regions impairs stopping more than a
single pulse to one region alone? Could TMS administered any time during the tROI to just one of these regions
2
equally explain the results? In other words, pulsing only the pre-SMA early or late in the tROI, or pulsing only
the IFC early or late in the tROI might equally disrupt stopping performance. In this scenario, it seems that the
approach used here might not address the question about relative order as intended."
We thank the reviewer for this interesting suggestion, which is again something we had considered
prior to pre-registering this experiment and had even piloted a similar protocol to that suggested by
the reviewer. We believe it is possible to raise this concern with all previous research that has used
dual coil TMS to infer directionality (see, for example, Pascal-Leone et al., Science, 2001, 292(5516):
510-512. Silvanto et al., Cereb Cortex, 2005 15(11):1736-41). We also note that no set of contrasts is
perfect. The main reasons we chose not to peruse such an additional set of conditions was two-fold.
First, was a matter of interpretation. This experiment was oriented towards understanding the
interplay between the two regions. If a single pulse/coil conditions had been applied in isolation,
effects could have been interpreted as being specific to the target region only, and it would have not
been possible to make claims about their interplay. If we had chosen to perform the experiment with
both single and double coil conditions any dissociation between the two could have been interpreted
as being due to the overall amount of TMS applied or differential artefacts (such as a facial twitch
being more present in one condition and not the other). Therefore, we felt that while some inferential
advantage may be gained from additional conditions, such as those suggested by the reviewer, they
would also raise additional questions of interpretation, as well as additional multiple comparisons and
loss of power. Perhaps more importantly, it is only the double coil condition applied where artefacts
are comparable and the difference between conditions is the temporal order, which is critical to the
question at the heart of this investigation. The second reason was a matter of practical economy.
Establishing the efficacy of a single pulse TMS to either region is an interesting research question in-
of-itself and establishing a time course for the efficacy of TMS over each region would be even more
informative. However, investigating the time course for TMS efficacy with regions other than primary
sensory region is rarely undertaken, possibly due large amount of data and high levels of exposure to
TMS required to establish fine-grained chronometry. We felt that the design employed an already
lengthy experiment with high levels of TMS and piloting indicated that extension to include a single
coil condition would have likely have led to higher levels of participant attrition. We therefore
considered that the design achieved an economical balance between allowing inference and
feasibility.
“Minor Comments:
1.Given the race model and the results of De Jong et al. (1990), is it sound to assume the motoric periods of
stopping take at least 50 ms? In order for a stop process to head off a Go process, the stop process would need
to execute faster than motor responses in the peripheral nervous system.”
As with our response to point 1 we agree that testing, rather than assuming, the motoric transmission
time in individual participants would be an interesting adjunct to experiments such as these, as would
testing electromyographic responses under failed stop, stopped and go conditions. We certainly agree
that such experiments would make interesting additions to this line of research. We also wish to
highlight that in more recent discussions of the integration between of stop and go related activity the
focus is more commonly on the central nervous systems rather than the periphery, most likely within
basal ganglia and thalamic structures (e.g. Aron et al,. J. Neurosci, 2016, 36 (45) 11489-11495).
“2. How far away were the MEG guided TMS targets from the atlas guided targets used for the distance
adjustment procedure?”
The absolute mean Euclidian distance between the atlas guided targets and the MEG guided targets
was 9.6(4.8) mm (mean (±SD)) for the pre-SMA. When applied to the scalp surface the difference
was 10.9(4.8) mm. For the IFC, only using data where the MEG coordinates resolved to the right
hemisphere, the absolute Euclidian distance between targets was 18.7(8.5) mm and on the scalp
surface it was 23.1(12.4) mm. This information has been added to the revised manuscript and we
thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

“3. I spotted several typos. The manuscript would benefit from a careful proofreading. Just a couple I noted:
page 5, line 30 “was then be used” should be “was then used”; page 20, line 46 “design” should be
“designed” and “drafterd” should be “drafted”.”
We thank the reviewer for highlighting these and have made several additional alterations, throughout
the text.
