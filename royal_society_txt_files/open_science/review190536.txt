The manuscript entitled: "A novel synthetic strategy for styrene-butadiene-styrene tri-block
copolymer with high cis-1,4 units via changing catalytic active centers" is a work dealing with
the synthesis of SBS triblock copolymers via utilization of catalysts in order to provide a triblock
copolymer elastomer with better properties. The manuscript can be accepted for publication after
revision and clarification to the following points:
1. The authors state that they used n-BuLi for the synthesis of the PS block. I am wondering why
they did not use sec-BuLi which is more efficient for the polymerization and leads to low
molecular weight dispersities? The final polymers have high dispersities values and this can be a
reason for lower homogeneity regarding the properties of the polymer.
2. Can the authors comment about the ratio of the PB different microstructures?
3. The characterization part of the SBS polymer is very short. The authors should provide more
information and explanation on different points:
a. Why is the Tg PB significantly lower than the Li synthesized SBS? What is the reason for the
lower Tg? Did the authors compare it with literature data corresponding to the same Mw?
b. For the AFM measurements, how was the preparation of the sample influencing the observed
morphology?
c. also for AFM: I guess there is a mistake, "solution of the copolymer in toluene on a Si tip" it
cannot be that the drop casting was done a Si tip?
d. GPC: how many columns and of which quality did the authors used?
e. GPC: on what standard is the calibration fo the SEC measurements? Was there also a RI

This is an interesting work about the a novel synthetic strategy for styrene-butadiene-styrene tri-
block copolymer with high cis-1,4 units, which is quite interesting. However, I still have some
minor concerns before I can recommend it for publication:
1) In Figure 7, the AFM images are not clear and do not have a clear scale bar. The authors need
to have a better image with clear scale bar.
2) Although the work is quite interesting and could be potentially appealing to broad interest, the
authors seem to have written it towards a more specialized audience. I suggest the authors add a
brief overview in the introduction about the application of polymer materials, including
emerging important applications, such as air filtration (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2019, 11 (13),
pp 12880–12889; Macromolecular Materials and Engineering, 2017, 302(1), 1600353-1600380;
Macromolecular Materials and Engineering, 2018, 1800336-1800354) to appeal to broad interest.
Based on the above concerns, I suggest a minor revision.

The answers of the authors to the review questions are quite nice and they are clarifying almost

although the discussion is very helpful. Additionally, regarding GPC the authors should state
that no standard is used for the presented Mw data. Also, why was the sample filtered before
GPC? This is something that can alter the results in case of high molecular weight dispersities.
Did the authors check the quality of the solution before running the GPC test? Was the solubility

Response to Reviewers
Dear editor,
We sincerely appreciate you and the reviewers for reviewing our manuscript
(Manuscript ID: RSOS-190536) entitled “A novel synthetic strategy for
styrene-butadiene-styrene tri-block copolymer with high cis-1,4 units via changing
catalytic active centers”. According to the reviewers’ comments and your suggestions,
the manuscript has been revised carefully and substantially. The point-by-point
responses to reviewers’ are described as follows and marked with red font in the
revised manuscript.
Reviewer: 1
Q1: The authors state that they used n-BuLi for the synthesis of the PS block. I am
wondering why they did not use sec-BuLi which is more efficient for the
polymerization and leads to low molecular weight dispersities? The final polymers
have high dispersities values and this can be a reason for lower homogeneity
regarding the properties of the polymer.
Response:
Thank you for your suggestion, we agree with your viewpoint. Sec-BuLi is more
efficient for the polymerization than n-BuLi, and it does have the potential to obtain
block polymers with lower molecular weight dispersities. However, the sec-BuLi is
more active chemically, the storage and polymerization conditions are more
demanding, and the price of sec-BuLi is much expensive, so n-BuLi was chose as the
initiator for styrene in the first polymerization step in our experiment. In addition, in
the second polymerization step in this experiment, the polymerization of butadiene
was initiated by the catalytic system centered on transition metal nickel. Generally,
such a similar ternary nickel-based coordination catalytic system tends to have a
broader molecular weight distribution than anionic polymerization, which is also one
of the reasons why the final polymers have high dispersities values in this
experiment.
Q2: Can the authors comment about the ratio of the PB different microstructures?
Response:
This suggestion is very useful to us. Usually, there are three different
microstructures exist in polybutadiene segment backbone, which are cis-1,4 unit,
trans-1,4 unit and 1,2- unit as shown in Scheme 1, thereinto, cis-1,4 unit and
trans-1,4 unit are collectively called 1,4- unit. As a consequence of differing
microstructure, the various polybutadiene (PB) exhibit different physical and
mechanical properties. Specifically, the high cis-1,4 polybutadiene exhibit good
low-temperature properties, high resilience over a broad temperature range, low
heat-build-up on repeated deformation and high abrasion resistance, which are
highly desirable properties for tire; 1,2- PBd rubber possesses low rolling resistance
and wet skid resistance; trans-1,4 PBd is prone to be crystallized at room
temperature, which exhibits resinous status and plastic properties. (J. Appl. Polym.
Sci. 2014, 131(8), pp 40153, doi: 10.1002/APP.40153; Adv. Polym. Sci. 2006, 204, pp
1–12, doi: 10.1007/12_094; Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 119, pp 1941-1945, doi:
10.1002/ange.200604348)
Scheme 1 Three different microstructure of polybutadiene
Q3: The characterization part of the SBS polymer is very short. The authors should
provide more information and explanation on different points.
a. Why is the Tg PB significantly lower than the Li synthesized SBS? What is the reason
for the lower Tg? Did the authors compare it with literature data corresponding to the
same Mw?
Response:
Thank you very much for your suggestion. In Q2, we have introduced that the
microstructure of PB include cis-1,4 unit, trans-1,4 unit and 1,2- unit. Literature
reported that the Tg of cis-1,4 PBd ,trans-1,4 PBd and 1,2-PBd are -106<U+2103>, -107<U+2103>
and -15<U+2103> respectively. (Journal of Polymer Science, 40(136), pp 121-131, doi:
10.1002/pol.1959.1204013609) Consequently, the Tg of the SBS obtained via
changing catalytic active centers in this experiment was significantly lower than the Li
synthesized SBS, because the 1,2- unit of SBS synthesized via n-butyllithium system
could account to as high as 10%, which was Significantly higher than the SBS in this
experiment( 1,2- structure content ~2%).
The Tg of a polymer is determined by the influence of intramolecular and
intermolecular. Because copolymer with higher cis-1,4 unit content or tran-1,4 which
inherently possesses a much lower molecular internal rotation energy can
naturallyexhibit a much lower Tg which could maintain a nice flexibility at an
extremely low temperature. Thereinto, trans-1,4 PBd was prone to crystallize, we
expect to obtain a PBd with a high cis-1,4 structure to obtain a polymer with better
mechanical properties at low temperature. Meanwhile, with the increase of the 1,2-
structure content of polybutadiene, the force in the polymer molecule enhances, and
the intermolecular force weakens, consequently, the Tg rised with the increase of the
1,2- structure content.( Adv. Polym. Sci. 2006, 204, pp 1–12, doi: 10.1007/12_094;
Macromol. Chem. Phys., 1800479, 1, doi:org/10.1002/macp.201800479)
According to the suggestion of reviewer, in order to illustrate the effect of
stereo-structure on the Tg of the polymers containing PB segment, we have
supplemented the sentence “Because the copolymer with higher cis-1,4 unit content
which inherently possesses a much lower molecular internal rotation energy and
stronger intermolecular force, which could maintain a better flexibility at an
extremely low temperature” with red font in section 3.4 in the revised manuscript.
According to the literatures, Zhang et al. (Polymer 2009, 50, pp 5427-5433,
doi:10.1016/j.polymer.2009.09.070) synthesized a SBS with 8% 1,2- structure content
by a di-lithium catalyst via anionic polymerization, the Mn the of the result polymer
was 9.84×104, the Tg was about -88 <U+2103>. Lee et al. (Macromolecules 2013, 46, pp
4529-4539, doi:10.1021/ma400479b.) synthesized an alternating Poly(styrene-b-
butadiene) multiblock copolymers using a combination of living anionic
polymerization and urethane based polycondensation, the Mn the of the result
polymer was 9.0×104, the Tg of PBd segment was about -80 <U+2103>. While Cui et al.
synthesized a SBS with Mn of 8.8×104 and 95.5% cis-1,4 structure, the Tg of PBd
segment was -104<U+2103>(Chem-Eur. J., 16, 14007-14015, doi:10.1002/chem.201001634),
The Tg was very close to the tri-block copolymer obtained in our experiment (Mn=6.1
×104, cis-1,4:97.2%, Tg(PB)=-102.1<U+2103>). It is indicated that the SBS could be obtained
by the coordination polymerization with lower Tg than that obtained via the
lithium-based anionic coordination.
b. For the AFM measurements, how was the preparation of the sample influencing
the observed morphology?
Response:
During the preparation process of the sample for AFM measurements, we found
that the observed morphology was affected by the following factors, such as the
solvent kinds, the concentration of copolymer solution, the coating thickness of the
sample, and so on. Thereinto, the factors of the solvent kinds and the concentration
of copolymer solution could affect the dispersion status of the polymer in the solvent
and evaporation rate, which will further affect morphology of the coating. In addition,
a suitable coating thickness is also very important in this test, and it directly
determines whether a clear and usable morphology image could be obtained.
.
c. also for AFM: I guess there is a mistake, "solution of the copolymer in toluene on a
Si tip" it cannot be that the drop casting was done a Si tip?
Response:
Thank you so much for your suggestion, and we really apologize for the
inconvenience to you caused by these inaccurate expressions. The sentence of "
Samples were prepared by adding three drops (150 µL) of a 1.0 wt % solution of the
copolymer in toluene on a Si tip" had been corrected to “Sample was prepared by
adding three drops (150 µL) of a 1.0 wt % solution of the copolymer in toluene onto a
Si wafer” by "Track Changes" function. (as shown in section 2.3 in the revised
manuscript.)
d. GPC: how many columns and of which quality did the authors used?
Response:
In the test of the GPC, 5 mg SBS was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to obtain
a solution with concentration of ca. 5 wt ‰ and then filtered through a 0.22 mm
filter. Thereinto, 200µl aforementioned SBS solution was injected into the SEC
measurements to conduct the measurement of Mn and Mw/Mn of the tri-block
polymer.
e. GPC: on what standard is the calibration for the SEC measurements? Was there
also a RI detector used?
Response:
The molecular weight and polydispersity index of SBSs were determined on a
DAWN EOS size exclusion chromatography/multi-angle laser light scattering
instrument (SEC-MALLS, Wyatt Technology). The chromtographic system consisted of
a Waters 515 pump, a differential refractometer (Optilab rEX), and a column (MZ 103
Å 300× 8.0 mm). The Mn data obtained from this instrument are the absolute
molecular weight value without a standard sample. In addition, there also a RI
detector used in the instrument, and the SEC curve in our manuscript was obtained

Q1: In Figure 7, the AFM images are not clear and do not have a clear scale bar. The
authors need to have a better image with clear scale bar.
Response:
Thank you very much for your suggestion, and we really apologize for any
inconvenience to you because of the inappropriate image. We have processed the
image according to the reviewer's suggestion, as shown in Fig.1 (Fig.7 in the revised
manuscript)

(entry 3, in table 1, scan size: 500 nm xSt= 35.1 mol%)
Q2: Although the work is quite interesting and could be potentially appealing to
broad interest, the authors seem to have written it towards a more specialized
audience. I suggest the authors add a brief overview in the introduction about the
application of polymer materials, including emerging important applications, such as
air filtration (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2019, 11 (13), pp 12880–12889;
Macromolecular Materials and Engineering, 2017, 302(1), 1600353-1600380;
Macromolecular Materials and Engineering, 2018, 1800336-1800354) to appeal to
broad interest.
Response:
Thank you very much for your suggestion. According to the reviewer's
suggestion, in order to further illustrate the advantage of the advanced polymer
materials, we had supplemented the sentence at the beginning of introduction as
follows “Advanced polymer materials are widely concerned by people because of
their lightweight, high strength and multiple functions” with red font in the revised
manuscript.
In addition, the sections of “Ethics” and “Acknowledgements” had been
supplemented at the end of the revised manuscript according to the suggestion of
the editor.
Finally, this article has been carefully checked repeatedly, and the grammatical
and wording errors had been corrected and marked using "Track Changes" function
in the revised manuscript.
We hope that the explanations and modifications fulfill the reviewers’
requirements and the manuscript meets the criteria to be accepted for publication in
Royal society Open Science.
If there are any problems, please do not hesitate to inform us as soon as
possible. Finally, we take this opportunity to say thanks to you and the reviewers.
Yours sincerely

Appendix B
Response to Reviewers
Dear editor,
We sincerely appreciate you and the reviewers for reviewing our manuscript
(Manuscript ID: RSOS-190536.R1) entitled “A novel synthetic strategy for
styrene-butadiene-styrene tri-block copolymer with high cis-1,4 units via changing
catalytic active centers”. According to the reviewers’ comments and your suggestions,
the manuscript has been revised carefully and substantially. The point-by-point
responses to reviewers’ are described as follows and marked with red font and
yellow highlight in the revised manuscript.
Reviewer: 1
Q1: The answers of the authors to the review questions are quite nice and they are
clarifying almost all the points. Thus the authors did not elaborate quite a lot of the
answers into their manuscript although the discussion is very helpful.
Response:
Thank you for your suggestion. We agree with your viewpoint, and the following
modifications were made.
Accroding to the Q1 in the first version of reviewer comment “The authors state
that they used n-BuLi for the synthesis of the PS block. I am wondering why they did
not use sec-BuLi which is more efficient for the polymerization and leads to low
molecular weight dispersities? The final polymers have high dispersities values and
this can be a reason for lower homogeneity regarding the properties of the polymer”,
we have supplemented the sentence “Compared with sec-butyllithium and
tert-butyllithium, n-butyllithium has better storage stability, using safety and lower
price, which are benefit for industrial-scaled application of this synthetic strategy.
Therefore, the n-butyllithium was chosen as the initiator for styrene in the
polymerization step” with red font and yellow highlight. (In the section of 3.1 in the
revised manuscript 2)
According to the Q2 in the first version of reviewer comment “can the authors
comment about the ratio of the PB different microstructures”, we briefly introduced
the advantages of the cis-1,4 structure in the “introduction” section of the original
manuscript, such as “Previous reports have shown that increasing the content of
cis-1,4 units can significantly improve the poor low temperature resistance and
tensile properties of the polybutadiene and its block copolymers”, and so on. In
addition, we have already supplemented the sentence in this revised manuscript 1
“ Because the copolymer with higher cis-1,4 unit content which inherently
possesses a much lower molecular internal rotation energy and stronger
intermolecular force, which could maintain a better flexibility at an extremely low
temperature” with red font in section 3.4 of the revised manuscript 1.
According to the Q3a in the first version of reviewer comment“Why is the Tg PB
significantly lower than the Li synthesized SBS? What is the reason for the lower Tg?
Did the authors compare it with literature data corresponding to the same Mw?”, we
we have provided the elaboration“The SBS obtained via changing the catalytic active
centers by incorporating 35.1% PS (molar ratio, detailed in Entry 3, Table 1) showed a
Tg of -102.1 <U+2103>, which is very close to the Tg of Ni-based butadiene rubber, and was
notably lower than the Tg of industrial SBS obtained via the Li catalytic system (~
-80 <U+2103>), indicating high performance at low temperatures. Because the copolymer
with higher cis-1,4 unit content which inherently possesses a much lower molecular
internal rotation energy and stronger intermolecular force, which could maintain a
better flexibility at an extremely low temperature ” in the section 3.4 of the revised
manuscript 1.
Accroding to the Q3d in the first version of reviewer comment“how many
columns and of which quality did the authors used? ”, we have supplement the
sentence “The samples were dissolved in THF with the concentration of 5.0 mg mL-1.
Thereinto, 200 µL aforementioned SBS solution was injected into the SEC
measurements to conduct the measurement.” in the section 2.3 of revised
manuscript 2 with red font and yellow highlight.
Q2: Additionally, regarding GPC the authors should state that no standard is used for
the presented Mw data.
Response:
This suggestion is very useful to us. We have supplemented the sentence “The
Mw data obtained from this instrument are the absolute molecular weight value
without a standard sample.” In the in the section 2.3 of revised manuscript 2 with red
font and yellow highlight.
Q3: Also, why was the sample filtered before GPC? This is something that can alter
the results in case of high molecular weight dispersities. Did the authors check the
quality of the solution before running the GPC test? Was the solubility fine?
Response:
Thank you very much for your suggestion. Firstly, the purpose of filtration is only
to remove the impurities mixed in the preparation of the polymer solution sample,
such as dust in the air, and so on. Because this Sec-Malls used in this test is a
precision instrument, especially the chromatography column part (MZ 103 Å 300×
8.0 mm). In order to protect the instrument, all the samples need to be filtered
before being tested, otherwise, some impurities or dust may block the gel column.
However, the filtration would not affect the polymer test results.
We have tested the solubility of SBS in the solution of tetrahydrofuran (THF),
and the result showed that the SBS tri-block copolymers synthesized in our
experiment possessed very good solubility in THF. In addition, the polymer in THF
solution prepared in this GPC testing has a concentration of only 5 mg mL-1, which
was very low. The low concentration ensureed that the polymer chain can be
sufficiently dispersed in the solvent in the random and unfold status, and the
intermolecular forces was very small. Because the filter size is large enough (0.22
µm), the polymer molecular chains could completely pass the filter under a certain
pressure by extrusion.
In order to verify the changes of solution state before and after filtration, a
particle size test was conductedon. The hydrodynamic diameter, diameter
distribution were determined by Dynamic light scattering (DLS, Malvern Instruments,
UK). The scattered light of a He-Ne laser at 633 nm was measured at an angle of 173o.
The sample of SBS (Entry 3, in Table 1 of revised manuscript 2) was dissolved in THF
with the concentration of 5.0 mg mL-1. Firstly, the sample was tested directly without
filtration, and then the solution was filtered through a 0.22 µm filter, and which was
tested again.
Fig.1 DLS traces comparison of SBS solution in THF beofre and after filtration.
As shown in Fig.1, the SBS solution before and after filtration had almost no
other particle size except for a certain amount of particles with a particle size of
about 10 nm, and the state change before and after filtration was very small, which
indicated that the polymer SBS has a good solubility in solution and was distributed
in a unfold status. In addition, the particles with a particle size of about 10 nm could
easily pass through the 0.22 µm filter.
Finally, this article has been carefully checked repeatedly, and the grammatical
and wording errors had been corrected and marked using "Track Changes" function
in the revised manuscript.
We hope that the explanations and modifications fulfill the reviewers’
requirements and the manuscript meets the criteria to be accepted for publication in
Royal society Open Science.
If there are any problems, please do not hesitate to inform us as soon as
possible. Finally, we take this opportunity to say thanks to you and the reviewers.
