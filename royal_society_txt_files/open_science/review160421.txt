I liked the paper very much as it uncovers inter-specific differences in immune investment and
host-parasite coevolution (although this is not mentioned in full). It also shows just how
convenient odonates are for host-parasite research.
I have two general comments. First, I wonder whether your results change using dry mass rather
than fresh, wet mass. As authors are aware, humidity may vary along the day and season, and
may cause substantial intra-and interspecific changes especially in small individuals. Second,
although I liked the last part of the Discussion in regards to other ecological explanations, I
wonder whether they can include explanations that we know may explain differences in immune
investment. One case, for example, is that of mating systems. Your species selection include
territorial and nonterritorial species, do these differences explain your results too?

In “Larger host species size indicates a higher immune response in dragonflies ad damselflies”
the author’s main goal was to see whether there are interspecific differences in a proxy of
immune response, nylon insert encapsulation. Additionally they wanted to determine whether
encapsulation could explain levels of parasitism and whether host species size could explain
3
encapsulation. This is an interesting study that furthers our knowledge of understanding
parasitism in odonates but has several issues that should be addressed.
Major issues
The major issue that I have is with the assumption of using species as independent data points
especially in the context where factors are evolved (e.g. size, fresh mass and immune response). If
immune response (encapsulation) is evolved you can expect host phylogeny, especially between
the suborders and genera, to play a role; more closely related species may respond more similarly
to encapsulation. I suggest that the authors re-analyze the data controlling for phylogeny and see
if the patterns remain the same. One way of testing this would be using phylogenetic
comparative methods, such as phylogenetic independent contrasts or phylogenetic generalized
least squares.
Page 2 Line 17-19 In the abstract, the authors state the aim of the study was to see whether
immune response could explain parasitism levels in odonates. But the parasitism levels are not
presented in the main text other than in the discussion where it is mentioned almost in passing
that encapsulation explains parasitism levels measured by the authors in previous work (Page 8
line 162-163). I suggest including what the levels of parasitism were, including an extra figure
showing the correlation between levels of parasitism and encapsulation, and actually include the
statistical results. If this is one of the aims of the authors in this study, I suggest they include it in
the methods and the results.
There is an inconsistency in the text about parasitism levels and encapsulation or immune
response that should be addressed. The inconsistency is between Page 3 Lines 44-46, Page 4
Line76 and Page 8 Line 160-164. On page 3, the authors’ state that “highest mite prevalence and
intensity have been found to have the highest probability of mounting an encapsulation”. But the
prediction on page 4 is the opposite by stating that “because we previously found that
dragonflies have lower parasitism rates than damselflies, we predict that dragonfly species have
greater encapsulation” and page 8 “we can see that the species’ with low parasitism rates have
high encapsulation responses”.
Minor issues
Page 3 line 39 – the “e.g.” is not necessary in this line
Page 4 line 68 - be more specific about the factors causing the differences.
Page 5 Line 87-88 – This section would benefit from some clarification about odonate collecting.
Were different species collected at different years or were individuals of the same species
collected over different years? The authors’ later state that the aim was to collect “within a few
days to minimize spatial and temporal variation” but the collection spanned years, which is very
confusing for the reader. The year could have an effect on immunity and levels of parasitism. The
authors should clarify what was collected when.
Page 6 Line 110 – please clarify how you measured the darkness of the implant and how the
average darkness of an implant was calculated. Did the authors measure several points (?) on the
implant and then calculate the average or does the program they were using calculate the average
automatically and then what settings did they use in the program. This clarification would help
for consistency in future studies.
Page 6 Line 117 – Has this formula been used previously? If so then it should be a reference.

Page 7 Line 145 – There is no statistical support for the statement in this last sentence and it
should be included here. Also it should be stated in the methods that the authors are testing for
differences between the suborders. I would also suggest that the authors run the analyses for each
suborder separately.
Page 10 Line 206-207 – There should be a reference for the statement that damselflies live more
densely.
Page 13 Line 307 – Smith B.P. is not an author on this paper.

In the present study the authors measured one important component of immune response
(encapsulation) in damselflies and dragonflies, and related it to the presence of important
parasites (gregarines and mites) and body mass, with and without controling for phylogenetic
relatedness. Odonates have been important models for studies of parasitism and the evolution of
immune responses in insects, and therefore it is important to provide explanations on the parasite
pressures that shape immune responses in these insects. Including phylogenetic control is
important for this purpose, and the autors have justified this properly.
Despite the subject is interesting and novel, the statistical analyses are not appropriate, which can
change the results and the conclusions. Also, some conclusions are not in accordance with results.
Line 23. Body size is not the same as body mass. Unlike mass, size does not change with
individual condition. All the text should say body mass.
Line 34. Is there evidence of induced immunity (immune priming) in odonates?
Line 48. What do you mean with adaptively free resources?
Lines 56-58. This sentence is not clear.
Line 65. Why should results in Odonata be representative of insects? They do not need to be. I
suggest to remove this idea.
Lines 65-81. It is better to use the past time instead of the future, as you already did everything.
Line 114. two sides instead of both sides (I imagine it is a cylindirical implant)
Line 120. This equation is not necessary here. "left" and "right" are arbitrary. Just say that you
took two measurements of each implant.
Lines 137-139. Why using the average instead of the values of each individual? By using the
average you lose a lot of information about variation.
Line 142. 0 and 100% parasitized individuals in each species? Clarify
Results section:
I do not think that the statistical analyses are appropriate. Given that encapsulation response,
gregarine prevalence and mite prevalence are the response variables that are dependent on
species, sex and body mass, why not carrying out one single analysis for each dependent
variable, with all these explanatory variables (and interactions) in one single GLM?
9
Line 143. Gregarine and mite counts have to be analyzed with generalized linear models with
Poisson or negative binomial errors. Prevalence should be analyzed with GLMs with binomial
errors. What about differences by sex or species? They need to be specified in the model.
Line 149. Why do you use this method? please provide some current reference for using it.
All across the results section the authors use a strange notation for specifying standard errors.
They should be, for example, 10±2.6 instead of 10,SE±2.6.
Line 168-171. The analyses of prevalence should be GLMs with binomial errors, as prevalence is
not a continuous variable.
Line 202. What do you mean with the lack of nutrition?
Line 203. What do you mean with “acquire more nutrition”?
Lines 212-213. You justify your results saying that larger individuals of a species have stronger
immune response. You could also evaluate this idea with your data. However, you did not carry
out analyses within species (I do not understand why). Probably you would find the same
pattern.
Line 236. Do not confound body size with body mass.
Line 250. Another mechanism could be physiological, related to hormones. For example, there is
evidence about the effect of juvenile hormone in mite growth in odonates that could be helpful to
explain your results.
Line 264. According to your results, parasitism levels are not related to encapsulation rates.
Figure 1. According to the analyses, the relationships between body mass and parasite
prevalences were negative and significant. However, the figures c and e do not illustrate such
relations.
It would be helpful to see a figure of the phylogenetic tree including the studied species.
Please revise language as there are some mistakes that prevent full comprehension of the
manuscript.

The authors took into account some of my previous suggestions, but not my main suggestion of
re-analyzing data with generalized linear models. As in my previous comments, I still believe
that the statistical analyses are inapropriate. The arcsine transformation was used by the authors
despite this method, which was used in the past, is not recommended anymore (Warton and Hui
2011. The arcsine is asinine: the analysis of proportions in ecology. Ecology, 92, 3-10). Textually,
Warton and Hui conclude: “Readers are encouraged to use modern alternatives to the arcsine
transform, and we hope that textbook revisions will no longer suggest it as a transformation for
proportional data, as it can be considered an historical antiquity”. Moreover, the authors are
using non parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U tests) despite they transformed the data. Was it
because normality was not achieved after transformation?

The authors took into account some of my previous suggestions, but not my main suggestion of
re-analyzing data with generalized linear models. As in my previous comments, I still believe
that the statistical analyses are inapropriate. The arcsine transformation was used by the authors
despite this method, which was used in the past, is not recommended anymore (Warton and Hui
2011. The arcsine is asinine: the analysis of proportions in ecology. Ecology, 92, 3-10). Textually,
Warton and Hui conclude: “Readers are encouraged to use modern alternatives to the arcsine
transform, and we hope that textbook revisions will no longer suggest it as a transformation for
proportional data, as it can be considered an historical antiquity”. Moreover, the authors are
using non parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U tests) despite they transformed the data. Was it
because normality was not achieved after transformation?
Line 134. It does not make sense to take the average of each gender if you are not comparing
males and females.

phylogenetic relatedness is only controlled in less important analyses of correlations between all

ver letter with corrections
ar Editor and reviewers,
is rewritten manuscript has gone through an extensive process, in which we added parasitism
ta and included phylogenetical relatedness as an explanation to our findings. Given our results
d the extent of our data, we feel that this new and improved manuscript is worth publishing.
evious comments by reviewers have been answered under their comments.

ked the paper very much as it uncovers inter-specific differences in immune investment and
st-parasite coevolution (although this is not mentioned in full). It also shows just how convenient
onates are for host-parasite research.
ave two general comments. First, I wonder whether your results change using dry mass rather
an fresh, wet mass. As authors are aware, humidity may vary along the day and season, and
ay cause substantial intra-and interspecific changes especially in small individuals. Second,
hough I liked the last part of the Discussion in regards to other ecological explanations, I wonder
ether they can include explanations that we know may explain differences in immune
estment. One case, for example, is that of mating systems. Your species selection include
ritorial and nonterritorial species, do these differences explain your results too?
irst of all, we believe fresh body mass is better indicator of size than dried body mass. This in
nd, we had all our specimens in their individual containers for 18 hours with a moist paper to
pty their digestive tracks and to prevent their dehydration. We believe these precautions made
ight evaluations precise enough.
We have been exploring territoriality's effect on odonates, but at the moment there is not enough
ta of territoriality to be used in this manuscript. There are surprisingly few publications giving a
tailed description of this mating behavior. However, this is an aspect we are currently working
h and will hopefully publish results in the future.

mments to the Author(s)
“Larger host species size indicates a higher immune response in dragonflies ad damselflies” the
thor’s main goal was to see whether there are interspecific differences in a proxy of immune
sponse, nylon insert encapsulation. Additionally they wanted to determine whether encapsulation
uld explain levels of parasitism and whether host species size could explain encapsulation. This
an interesting study that furthers our knowledge of understanding parasitism in odonates but has
veral issues that should be addressed.
ajor issues
e major issue that I have is with the assumption of using species as independent data points
pecially in the context where factors are evolved (e.g. size, fresh mass and immune response). If
mune response (encapsulation) is evolved you can expect host phylogeny, especially between
e suborders and genera, to play a role; more closely related species may respond more similarly
encapsulation. I suggest that the authors re-analyze the data controlling for phylogeny and see if
e patterns remain the same. One way of testing this would be using phylogenetic comparative
ethods, such as phylogenetic independent contrasts or phylogenetic generalized least squares.
n this rewritten manuscript, we have included phylogenetic corrections to fresh body mass,
capsulation response and parasitism. These results have been discussed in light of phylogeny
d the impact it may have on these other measurable attributes.
ge 2 Line 17-19 In the abstract, the authors state the aim of the study was to see whether
mune response could explain parasitism levels in odonates. But the parasitism levels are not
esented in the main text other than in the discussion where it is mentioned almost in passing that
capsulation explains parasitism levels measured by the authors in previous work (Page 8 line
2-163). I suggest including what the levels of parasitism were, including an extra figure showing
e correlation between levels of parasitism and encapsulation, and actually include the statistical
sults. If this is one of the aims of the authors in this study, I suggest they include it in the methods
d the results.
We have now included both the gregarine and water mite prevalences to this manuscript, and
cussed their relationship with the other attributes.
ere is an inconsistency in the text about parasitism levels and encapsulation or immune
sponse that should be addressed. The inconsistency is between Page 3 Lines 44-46, Page 4
e76 and Page 8 Line 160-164. On page 3, the authors’ state that “highest mite prevalence and
ensity have been found to have the highest probability of mounting an encapsulation”. But the
ediction on page 4 is the opposite by stating that “because we previously found that dragonflies
ve lower parasitism rates than damselflies, we predict that dragonfly species have greater
capsulation” and page 8 “we can see that the species’ with low parasitism rates have high
capsulation responses”.
We have discussed and clarified the introduction to better highlight contradictions in previous
dies, as well as what can be expected based on these findings.

mments to the Author(s)
the present study the authors measured one important component of immune response
ncapsulation) in damselflies and dragonflies, and related it to the presence of important parasites
regarines and mites) and body mass, with and without controling for phylogenetic relatedness.
onates have been important models for studies of parasitism and the evolution of immune
ponses in insects, and therefore it is important to provide explanations on the parasite pressures
at shape immune responses in these insects. Including phylogenetic control is important for this
rpose, and the autors have justified this properly.
spite the subject is interesting and novel, the statistical analyses are not appropriate, which can
ange the results and the conclusions. Also, some conclusions are not in accordance with results.
We agree that there are alternative approaches in data analysis. However, the methods we have
ed are correct and reliable. Moreover,the focus of this paper is differences between species and
ferences between the two suborders (damselflies and dragonflies) rather than within species
ferences, such as between sexes.

ndition. All the text should say body mass.
his is true and we replaced the word "size" with "body mass" throughout the manuscript where

s far as we know, there are no studies on induced immunity done on odonates.

ne 114. two sides instead of both sides (I imagine it is a cylindirical implant)
mplants we use have a knot 1mm from one end and 2mm from one end, creating an angle to the
plant. This makes the implant have two distinct sides, i.e. left and right side. Therefore the use of
oth sides".
ne 120. This equation is not necessary here. "left" and "right" are arbitrary. Just say that you took
o measurements of each implant.
s we replied in the previous section, due to the angle in the usually cylindrical implant, there are
arly two different sides in the implants.
nes 137-139. Why using the average instead of the values of each individual? By using the
erage you lose a lot of information about variation.
ue to behavioral differences between males and females, it was always easier to catch males
dependent of the species in question. Therefore our data contains more males than females, and
balance this, we chose to calculate an average value for each sex and use these two values for
e species value. This way we could more accurately evaluate the value each species has. Because
s manuscript is all about species differences and not individual differences, losing information

We clarified this: "... the prevalence ranged from 0 in some species to a 100 percent in others."
sults section:
o not think that the statistical analyses are appropriate. Given that encapsulation response,
egarine prevalence and mite prevalence are the response variables that are dependent on species,
x and body mass, why not carrying out one single analysis for each dependent variable, with all
ese explanatory variables (and interactions) in one single GLM?
ur main objective was to see whether differences existed between species, not within. We ran a
LM, and in this analysis both the species and the mass were significant factors. However,
gardless of what method we use to analyze our data, if mass is an explanatory factor, differences
arly exist (this can easily be seen from the figures). GLM might be a useful tool if we were
erested in sex differences, but we covered parasitism of sexes in our previous paper ("Are sexes
ually parasitized in damselflies and dragonflies?" by Ilvonen et al. 2016 Oikos) and using GLM
es not give us anything new in regards of species differences. Also, we did check sex differences
encapsulation using GLM, and found no differences. However, this paper is all about species
ferences, and we do not think running GLM will give us more than we already knew or did using
r current methods. In addition, we are particularly interested in the effect phylogeny has on
capsulation and parasitism and using GLM would offer a more complicated method, thus
creasing the general understandability of this manuscript.
ne 143. Gregarine and mite counts have to be analyzed with generalized linear models with
isson or negative binomial errors. Prevalence should be analyzed with GLMs with binomial
ors. What about differences by sex or species? They need to be specified in the model.
nce again, this is a paper about species differences. These methods you describe are good
thods, especially if you are interested in within species differences. However, we have done a
dy on that (see "Are sexes equally parasitized in damselflies and dragonflies?" by Ilvonen et al.
16, Oikos) and repeating those results is unnecessary. In addition, it is clear that there are
ferences between species, regardless of the statistical methods we use, and the existence of these
ferences is the main point of this paper.
ne 149. Why do you use this method? please provide some current reference for using it.
ested Analysis of Variance is old, but a good way of determining phylogenetic effects, especially
ce we go only to the family level in our analysis. The reason we chose to cite Strearns and the
ok by Harvey & Pagel, was that the book clearly describes what we did and Stearns was one of
e first to use this method for testing the effects phylogeny has. Nested Analysis of Variance has
cently been used to determine phylogenetic effects in e.g. a paper called "Regional and
ylogenetic variation of wood density across 2456 Neotropical tree species" (Chave et al. 2006),
ological Applications.
l across the results section the authors use a strange notation for specifying standard errors. They

he aim of the citation was to emphasize the importance of host size in parasitism. We clarified
at sentence in manuscript. The main objective of this manuscript was to study differences between
ecies, not individuals, and due to space limitations and general coherence, analysis done on
dividual level has to be postponed to future manuscripts, because this is an interesting and
portant question.

e authors took into account some of my previous suggestions, but not my main
ggestion of re-analyzing data with generalized linear models. As in my previous
mments, I still believe that the statistical analyses are inapropriate. The arcsine
nsformation was used by the authors despite this method, which was used in the
st, is not recommended anymore (Warton and Hui 2011. The arcsine is asinine: the
alysis of proportions in ecology. Ecology, 92, 3-10). Textually, Warton and Hui
nclude: “Readers are encouraged to use modern alternatives to the arcsine
nsform, and we hope that textbook revisions will no longer suggest it as a
nsformation for proportional data, as it can be considered an historical antiquity”.
oreover, the authors are using non parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U tests) despite
ey transformed the data. Was it because normality was not achieved after
nsformation?
We have now re-analyzed the data using GLMs models. Additional text has been added
the Material & Methods section in the Statistics part, to the Results section and to the
scussion part.
ue to the use of GLMs, the arcsine problem is gone.
e are still using non-parametric tests, because the variances between the two suborders
ere different and thus we were unable to use a t-test.
ne 134. It does not make sense to take the average of each gender if you are not
mparing males and females.
We have now included sex as a factor in the GLMs models and these results have been
ded to the manuscript. In the interspecific comparisons, we used estimated marginal
eans derived from the GLMs models for each species as independent observations.
erefore sex differences do not affect species marginal means.

nes 178-179. So phylogenetic corrections were only used for correlation analyses and not for
LMs? Why? Do species differ in immune response, body mass, gregarines and mites after
ntrolling for phylogenetic relatedness? This seems to be the main goal of the study, but
ylogenetic relatedness is only controlled in less important analyses of correlations between all
ese variables. I do not understand why.
o assess whether species differ in these traits after controlling for phylogeny, we calculated
ether a phylogenetic signal (whether species resemble each other less than expected under the
ownian motion model of trait evolution) exists in these four traits. It exists strongly in weight,
akly in the others. We also calculated correlations using phylogenetic generalized linear models
R Studio (caper package). Using this method gave us the same results as previous methods we
