This review covers the salient areas of fertility research but there are a few areas (detailed below)
where more recent studies should be mentioned which would naturally lead to a wider
discussion. In general, the review is rather broad and so the authors haven’t given themselves the
scope to explore any one area in greater detail; consequently, the review is more “textbook-like”
rather than providing a forum for discussing the issues which are current in the field.
Areas that require further discussion:
The description of the acrosome reaction as well as that of sperm binding to the ZP is inaccurate:
Page 11 lines 202-206: the idea that the ZP triggers the acrosome reaction is outdated (PMID:
26872876) and it has been shown that acrosome-reacted sperm can pass through the ZP (PMID:
22084105) implying that the acrosomal enzymes are not required to pass this barrier.
Page 11 line 203: the plasma membrane and the outer acrosomal membrane fuse, do not break
down.
Page 18 lines 343-344: the reference cited is very old and Dean et al. have produced evidence
suggesting that ZP2 mediates gamete the binding (PMID: 22734000, PMID 24934154).
Page 18 lines 354-358: again these references are out of date, the hypothesis suggesting that O-
glycans on mZP3 – specifically on Ser332 and Ser334 - might be involved in sperm binding was
questioned by the genetic ablation of glycosyltransferases as well as by genetic mutation of the
specific residues (Ser332 and Ser334) which did not prevent fertility (PMID: 7663023; PMID:
17374637).
Finally another old reference in the paragraph about Juno:
Page 19 line 378: The recent crystal structure of the human proteins shows that actually the
surface behind the putative JUNO ligand binding pocket binds IZUMO1 (PMID: 27309808 and
PMID: 27309818).

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This review summarizes the existing knowledge on sperm and egg genes directly influencing
fertilization, with focus on mammals. It is mostly very well written and an enjoyable read and
gives a good overview of the genes in sperm and egg. For the text itself my comments are mostly
very minor (detailed below, though the Application section is somewhat confusing in parts).
After having read the review part – I was looking forward to reading the applications and
“potential pathway forward”. However, at this point the manuscript seems to fall a bit short.
For an evolutionary ecologist, it seems to somewhat superficially summarizing how knowledge
on key genes and proteins of eggs and sperm can be used in understanding evolution
(particularly as it relates to natural populations and non-model taxa). Yet, for a wider impact of
the survey, this section should be developed further (and in parts improved for clarity).
I specifically was missing discussions about emerging molecular tools and the role of
glycobiology in egg-sperm interactions – this would seem timely given the recent surge of
literature in this feel and the aimed focus on “molecular variation” set forward by the authors.
This is important also as – unlikely for a direct gene-protein template – the variation that is
induced by alteration of proteins via glycosylation (as post-translational modification) is not
directly template driven. Thereby the link from gene to the molecular phenotype may not be as
clean cut as the review seems to indicate. (This is very briefly touched upon on L357 but the large
implications warrant more attention to these processes and the methods needed to study sperm-
egg interactions at the molecular level). Covering key aspects on this would increase the novel
insight gained from molecular variation of sperm and egg (and not only for mammal scientists).
Likewise, the aspects of variation in gene expression are not considered – yet both glycoproteins
(which are major post translational proteins) and gene expression will be important in the
dynamic interactions that take place during fertilization. Also the fact that reproductive proteins
typically evolve rapidly should be more explicitly stated (here the reviews by Swanson &
Vacquier 2002. Nature Review Genetics and Turner & Hoekstra 2008. “Causes and consequences
of the evolution of reproductive proteins”).
Finally, ecological perspectives are not much considered. For instance, how our understanding of
divergence of populations of mammals (or other taxa for that matter), and even ecological
speciation, might be increased with studies that merge the latest knowledge on the molecular
basis of sperm-egg variation and understanding of ecology and evolution of natural populations.
Clearly in mammals with internal fertilization, the direct impact of the environment on sperm or
egg is minimal (compared to taxa were fertilization is external) – yet both sperm and egg quality
(as well as gene expression) are likely to be affected by the external environment experienced by
males and females.
These aspects do not in my opinion require an extensive literature review, and can be kept
concise. However, I would encourage the authors to take a step towards these new insights and
thereby widen the impact of this review beyond stating “these are the genes and proteins” in
mammals. I hope you find my comments useful.
Specific comments
Please state explicitly that fertilization in mammals is internal in the introduction. Here would be
suitable to briefly discuss to what extent the maternal or paternal environment/physiology may
influence the quality of egg and sperm (and, for instance, gene expression). For a wider
readership this statement is informative (and sets the mammalian work in perspective/contrast
to the numerous non-mammalian taxa with external fertilization and embryonic development)
4
L46-47. In many instances the lock-key system may be mediated by interacting glycans and
surface proteins. What is known in mammals about this?
L60-64. Here would be a suitable place to briefly consider the role of gene expression variation
(which may be influenced by environment and physiological state) in determining sperm/egg
characteristics and thereby, perhaps, interactions between them.
L69. Which taxa were these proteins/genes identified?
L80-82. See my general comments. For “a guide” I think the application section (also with regard
to molecular tools available) needs to be strengthened.
L98-107. This section would be suitable for discussing the role of glycoproteins (thereby setting
the stage for glycans as dynamically responding postranslational modifications) as this is what
the ZP genes code for. My knowledge on glycans/glycoproteins of sperm is limited but this
aspect should be briefly touched upon in the sperm section (this seems relevant, for instance,
based on reviews by Mengerick and Vacquier 2001. Glycobiology).
The “3. Fertilization” section should briefly cover the role of environment and ecology (natural
selection) in determining sperm-egg interactions in mammals (and contrast those – briefly - with
internal vs external fertilizing species to give more context)
L131. In many molecular biotic interactions (including host and pathogens) glycan mimicry is
used. Is anything known about this in sperm-egg interactions ? (I.e. can sperm surface glycans be
modified to prevent identifying sperm as “alien”?) – this is a minor point that may not need
attention but if evidence exist, then is worth mentioning.
L220-222. This is a section where the role of environment on gene expression and
posttranslational modifications of the sperm-egg proteins could be touched upon.
The section from 411-426 on role of genetic similarity, drift in small populations and evolution of
mating strategies is somewhat confusingly written. The text implies these processes are linked
(and they may very well be), but the authors should be more explicit on how. Also several
statements are rather unclear. (Having someone not in the co-author list to read this might help to
identify sentences that are not clear)
L427-431. This section should also touch upon ecological speciation and to what extent
understanding the molecular underpinning of fertilization may (or may not) be important when
speciation occurs via adaptation to different environments in sympatry (i.e. especially in face of
gene flow). In part L432-440 is perhaps intended to deal with this, but this section I found
confusing. Turner and Hoekstra 2008 (Causes and consequences of
the evolution of reproductive proteins) seems a useful reference here.
“5. Applications” section: Here a wider coverage of the molecular basis, including protein
modifications – particularly glycosylation, the role of environment, gene expression and resulting
dynamic interactions, as well as rapid evolution of reproductive proteins should be better
covered.
Overall, given the many genes and their variable location in the sperm (detailed in text), it would
be useful to indicate those in one of the figures (Fig 4 seems most suitable).
Minor
L173. Clarify for non-expert readers what “capacitate” means. (I had to google it up).
L174. Clarify what you refer to by “removal” of seminal fluid. Removal from where?

Please clarify for benefit of non-experts.

label_comment_3
We have now received two reviews of your submitted article. Both reviewers agree that the
manuscript is, in general, well written. They agree that the subject matter is of interest and
contributes to the literature on the subject of fertilization. However, both reviewers feel that the
manuscript falls a bit short in some aspects. They state that some more recent development in the
field are not appropriately mentioned, and they would like to see the description of the advances
made in recent years to be expanded in some areas. Both reviewers make strong suggestions
where they would want to see the addition of further ideas and thoughts. Especially reviewer 2
lays out a few areas that should be covered in a very detailed manner.
For these reasons, both reviewers request a substantial revision of the manuscript before
publication. While the associate editor agrees with the reviewers, it is not necessary to write very
extensive additions to the text in those areas that the reviewers find missing. A concise paragraph
or two with the appropriate references should be fine for each section. It should be possible to
accomplish this within a shorter time period and then submit a revised manuscript.
Let us know if there are any questions or concerns.

In their revised version of the manuscript, the authors have been very responsive and diligent in
addressing the questions and criticisms raised by the two reviewers. They have added the
requested paragraphs that incorporate additional recent data on the subject, for instance,
regarding the initial acrosome reaction, and have highlighted some of the controversies in the
field. They have added references and clarified the text in several instances, as suggested by the
reviewers. A few of the comments made by the reviewers clearly went beyond the scope of the
present manuscript and might have led to a diversion from the main issues of the manuscript, it
is therefore fully justified to have declined to incorporate the further thematic (e.g. possible
environmental influences).
The revisions have clearly improved the general significance and conclusions of the manuscript,
and all the main points raised by the reviewers have been addressed.
Appendix A
RESPONSE TO REVIEWER COMMENTS
REVIEWER #1
1. The description of the acrosome reaction as well as that of sperm binding to the ZP is
inaccurate:
Page 11 lines 202-206: the idea that the ZP triggers the acrosome reaction is outdated
(PMID: 26872876) and it has been shown that acrosome-reacted sperm can pass through
the ZP (PMID: 22084105) implying that the acrosomal enzymes are not required to pass
through this barrier.
Page 11 line 203: the plasma membrane and the outer acrosomal membrane fuse, they
do not break down.
True. This section has been corrected, with the appropriate references added. We have
also added an additional paragraph explaining this situation. Lines 235 to 247 now read:
“It has historically been thought that the acrosome reaction is triggered when the proteins
on the head of the spermatozoa that were exposed during capacitation interact with those
on the ZP. Indeed, several studies have shown that the ZP, and ZP3 in particular, have
sperm-binding capabilities and can also trigger the AR (e.g., Liu et al. 1996; Rankin et al.
1996). Additionally, during the AR enzymes are released that can dissolve the ZP,
creating a hole through which spermatozoa can pass (e.g., Wassarman et al. 2001).
However, recent studies have shown that - at least in mice - this is not necessarily the
case, and that spermatozoa can undergo the acrosome reaction prior to interaction with
the ZP, and even prior to encountering the cumulus cells surrounding the egg (Jin et al.
2011; LaSpina et al. 2016). Therefore, at this time the trigger(s) for the acrosome
reaction, and the exact location were it takes place, are not known. A role for an
interaction with the ZP still seems likely, but what that role is, and how essential it is, are
now unclear. One possibility is that interaction with the ZP3 may facilitate the
completion of the AR, rather than being a key aspect of AR initiation (Jin et al. 2011).”
2. Page 18 lines 343-344: the reference cited is very old and Dean et al, have produced
evidence suggesting that ZP2 mediates gamete the binding (PMID: 22734000, PMID
24934154).
The noted references have been changed to the more recent ones, as suggested.
3. Page 18 lines 354-358: again these references are out of date, the hypothesis
suggesting that O-glycans on mZP3 – specifically on Ser332 and Ser334 – might be
involved in sperm binding was questioned by the genetic ablation of glycosyltransferases
as well as by genetic mutation of the specific residues (Ser332 and Ser334) which did not
prevent fertility (PMID: 7663023; PMID 17374637).
This has been revised in light of the information presented in these papers (and references
therein. Lines 393 to 405 now read “Although, as stated above, the role of sperm binding
with the ZP has been revised with respect to triggering the acrosome reaction, sperm-ZP
binding is still an important step in fertilization, regardless of its role in the AR. For
example, mice that lack ZP3 form oocytes without a zona pellucida, which results in
sterility (Meczekalski et al. 2009). ZP3 is also thought to be responsible for the species-
specific binding of sperm to the egg (Wassarman et al. 2001). Although some studies
have found indications of which specific regions directly influence sperm binding
(Florman et al. 1985; Chen et al. 1998), other studies have obtained conflicting results
(Liu et al. 1995; Williams et al. 2007), and therefore the key regions involved remain
unknown. ZP3 polypeptides do not appear to interact with the sperm directly, but rather
do so via oligosaccharides that bind to the ZP3 polypeptides (e.g., Wassarman et al.
2001). Thus variation within the gene itself, as well as in the associated oligosaccharides,
is responsible for the subsequent effects on fertilization. Indeed, previous studies have
shown that this gene is under strong selection, causing rapid divergence between species
(Swanson et al. 2001).
4. Finally, another old reference in the paragraph about Juno:
Page 19 line 378: The recent crystal structure of the human proteins shows that actually
the surface behind the putative Juno ligand binding pocket binds Izumo1.
This has been changed, as has the related section for Izumo, based on these new
references. Lines 421 to 423 now read “Juno has a folate-binding pocket at amino acids
60-175; however the binding site for Izumo1 has been identified as the surface behind
this binding pocket, and specifically within amino acid sites 44-91 and 145-191 (Aydin et
al. 2016; Ishida et al. 2016).”
REVIEWER #2
1. For an evolutionary ecologist, it seems to somewhat superficially summarizing how
knowledge on key genes and proteins of eggs and sperm can be used in understanding
evolution (particularly as it relates to natural populations and non-model taxa). Yet, for a
wider impact of the survey, this section should be developed further (and in parts
improved for clarity… I specifically was missing discussions about emerging molecular
tools and the role of glycobiology in egg-sperm interactions – this would seem timely
given the recent surge of literature in this feel [field] and the aimed focus on “molecular
variation” set forward by the authors. This is important also as – unlikely for a direct
gene-protein template – the variation that is induced by alteration of proteins via
glycosylation (as post-translational modification) is not directly template driven. Thereby
the link from gene to the molecular phenotype may not be as clean cut as the review
seems to indicate. (This is very briefly touched upon on L357 but the large implications
warrant more attention to these processes and the methods needed to study sperm-egg
interactions at the molecular level). Covering key aspects on this would increase the
novel insight gained from molecular variation of sperm and egg (and not only for
mammal scientists).
It is true that, outside of the ZP, we do not discuss the role of glycoproteins in
fertilization, or the subsequent role/impacts of glycosylation. This was intentional
because, at least in mammals (to which our review is limited), there are not well-
described glycoproteins known to influence gamete compatibility other than those
described with the ZP. However, we have added a paragraph indicating the likely
importance of such glycoproteins, and explaining why they are not covered more in our
review. Specifically, lines 437 to 446 now read, “The genes discussed here primarily
code for proteins thought to interact directly with complementary proteins on the other
gamete. However, the products of some gamete compatibility genes, such as ZP3, bind to
sugar molecules and it is this combined glycoprotein that is involved in gamete
interactions (Tulsiani et al. 1997; Mengerink et al. 2001; Diekman et al. 2003). This
greatly increases the complexity of gamete interactions, with variation in the proteins
themselves, the sugar molecules, and in the post-translational modification
(glycosylation), potentially impacting gamete compatibility. However, we currently know
little about the role of glycoproteins in mammalian gamete compatibility, outside of those
involved with the ZP, but, given their importance in other taxonomic groups (e.g.,
Mengerink et al. 2001), it seems likely that they play an important role, the details of
which remain to be discovered.”
2. Likewise, the aspects of variation in gene expression are not considered – yet both
glycoproteins (which are major post translational proteins) and gene expression will be
important in the dynamic interactions that take place during fertilization. Also the fact
that reproductive proteins typically evolve rapidly should be more explicitly stated (here
the reviews by Swanson & Vacquier 2002. Nature Review Genetics and Turner &
Hoekstra 2008. “Causes and consequences of the evolution of reproductive proteins”).
While variation in gene expression could indeed be influential for gamete compatibility,
we are not aware of any knowledge, or studies, to this effect in mammals or even any
vertebrates. This seems to be a topic receiving attention in plants, but their mechanisms
are so different that they do not warrant mention in this review focused on mammals.
Therefore, we have not added text with regard to gene expression.
With respect to rapid evolution, we have added text to this effect. Lines 71 to 88 now
read “Genes involved in reproduction, and gamete compatibility in particular, have
proven to be among the fastest evolving genes in organisms yet studied (along with those
of the immune system) (e.g., Swanson & Vacquier 2002; Panhuis et al. 2006; Turner &
Hoekstra 2008). There are three primary hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive,
regarding the underlying selection pressures (Swanson & Vacquier 2002). The first is
sperm competition, where the genetic compliment of a sperm could influence its chances
of fertilization success at many stages throughout the fertilization process, and intense
competition among sperm could then lead to rapid evolution of the associated genes.
Second is sexual selection, where particular sperm-egg combinations have higher success
rates than others, leading to the continual co-evolution of genes expressed on the gametes
of both sexes. Lastly is sexual conflict, where selection on eggs to block polyspermy, and
intense competition among sperm, provide conflicting selection pressures on the gametes
(on eggs to make multiple fertilization difficult, and on sperm to more rapidly fertilize the
egg). This process would lead to a continual co-evolution of the genes involved in such
strategies. Related to the 'sexual selection' hypothesis is the rapid divergence in gamete
compatibility genes often found between recently diverged species (Gavrilets & Waxman
2002; Palumbi 2009; Hart et al. 2014). Selection against cross-species fertilization could
lead to rapid divergence of gamete compatibility genes, relative to other parts of the
genome, and thus lead to effective reproductive boundaries between taxa.
3. Finally, ecological perspectives are not much considered. For instance, how our
understanding of divergence of populations of mammals (or other taxa for that matter),
and even ecological speciation, might be increased with studies that merge the latest
knowledge on the molecular basis of sperm-egg variation and understanding of ecology
and evolution of natural populations. Clearly in mammals with internal fertilization, the
direct impact of the environment on sperm or egg is minimal (compared to taxa were
fertilization is external) – yet both sperm and egg quality (as well as gene expression) are
likely to be affected by the external environment experienced by males and females.
We have not added new text in response to this directly. However, we think that what we
originally included in the last paragraph of the “Applications” section, in addition to the
new related text added in response to critique #2 above, adequately capture what is
known about these genes – and how they can be applied - with respect to the speciation
process, or divergence of populations of mammals, to a depth appropriate for such a
review. With respect to ecology and environmental influences, it is true that the external
environment or conditions could influence gamete quality (e.g., if an individual is
malnourished, or otherwise of poor health), through impacts on gene expression.
However, we are not aware of any studies looking into this issue, and it seems like going
too far out on a limb to discuss the wealth of related topics (of which this is one),
regarding potential impacts of other factors, but for which there is not yet any data,
particularly for this review.
4. Please state explicitly that fertilization in mammals is internal in the introduction.
Here would be suitable to briefly discuss to what extent the maternal or paternal
environment/physiology may influence the quality of egg and sperm (and, for instance,
gene expression). For a wider readership this statement is informative (and sets the
mammalian work in perspective/contrast to the numerous non-mammalian taxa with
external fertilization and embryonic development)
This has been done. Lines 67 to 70 now read: “Although the benefits of genes influencing
gamete compatibility are clear in species with external fertilization such as these, to
ensure eggs are fertilized by sperm of the correct species, much evidence exists that such
genes are important in organisms with internal fertilization as well, such as mammals.”
5. L46-47. In many instances the lock-key system may be mediated by interacting glycans
and surface proteins. What is known in mammals about this?
See response to critique #1.
6. L60-64. Here would be a suitable place to briefly consider the role of gene expression
variation (which may be influenced by environment and physiological state) in
determining sperm/egg characteristics and thereby, perhaps, interactions between them.
See response to critique # 2.
7. L69. Which taxa were these proteins/genes identified?
This has been added. Lines 91 to 94 now read: “However, this changed in 2014 when a
pair of genes (called “Izumo” for the sperm surface protein, and “Juno” for the
complimentary egg receptor) was identified in mice with a specific ligand-receptor
relationship.”
8. L80-82. See my general comments. For “a guide” I think the application section (also
with regard to molecular tools available) needs to be strengthened.
We have added a paragraph to address this issue. Lines 500 to 519 now read “When
trying to identify loci influencing specific traits, two approaches are generally used: the
candidate gene approach where specific genes or loci are targeted for sequencing and
analysis; and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) where tens of thousands of loci
(generally single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) are analyzed to screen the genome
for regions or loci showing an appropriate signature. The rapid evolution, and decreasing
cost, of methods to characterize and genotype individuals at tens of thousands of SNPs
has led to the rapid growth of our understanding of how genotype influences fitness and
phenotype based on the GWAS approach (Hohenlohe et al. 2010; Cammen et al. 2015;
Timmann et al. 2017). However, such studies often involve two stages: the first involving
the large-scale genome screening to identify loci with an appropriate signature, and then a
second stage of further sequencing and characterization of the area around the SNP
originally identified. Therefore, the candidate gene approach may still be a more efficient
option in cases where putative candidate genes have been identified (Amos et al. 2011).
Much research has been conducted on potential gamete compatibility genes, and their
likely roles in the fertilization process. Therefore, the goal of this review was to bring this
wealth of literature together into one cohesive paper and framework, and to create a list
of candidate genes that hold the most potential for success, and therefore serve as a guide
for future studies. Moreover, given the broad range, and importance, of processes
influenced by gamete compatibility genes, we hope that his paper will serve as
motivation for more researchers to pursue this line of inquiry.”
9. L98-107. This section would be suitable for discussing the role of glycoproteins
(thereby setting the stage for glycans as dynamically responding postranslational
modifications) as this is what the ZP genes code for. My knowledge on
glycans/glycoproteins of sperm is limited but this aspect should be briefly touched upon
in the sperm section (this seems relevant, for instance, based on reviews by Mengerick
and Vacquier 2001. Glycobiology).
See our response to critique #1.
10. The “3. Fertilization” section should briefly cover the role of environment and
ecology (natural selection) in determining sperm-egg interactions in mammals (and
contrast those – briefly - with internal vs external fertilizing species to give more
context).
See our response to critique # 3.
11. L131. In many molecular biotic interactions (including host and pathogens) glycan
mimicry is used. Is anything known about this in sperm-egg interactions ? (I.e. can sperm
surface glycans be modified to prevent identifying sperm as “alien”?) – this is a minor
point that may not need attention but if evidence exist, then is worth mentioning.
See response to critique #1.
12. L220-222. This is a section where the role of environment on gene expression and
posttranslational modifications of the sperm-egg proteins could be touched upon.
See response to critique #s 2 and 3.
13. The section from 411-426 on role of genetic similarity, drift in small populations and
evolution of mating strategies is somewhat confusingly written. The text implies these
processes are linked (and they may very well be), but the authors should be more explicit
on how. Also several statements are rather unclear. (Having someone not in the co-
author list to read this might help to identify sentences that are not clear).
We have revised this text. Lines 466 to 474 now read “Understanding these patterns also
has large implications for the fields of conservation biology and conservation genetics. In
many of the species where non-random fertilization patterns have been found,
fertilizations are biased towards gametes that are genetically dissimilar (Kempenaers et
al. 1996; Olsson & Shine 1996; Tregenza & Weddell 2000; Birkhead & Pizarri 2002;
Mays & Hill 2004; Dziminski et al. 2008; Firman & Simmons 2008). The result is
offspring with higher levels of heterozygosity than expected from a similar-sized
random-mating population. In this way, this process can not only slow the decline of
heterozygosity expected from genetic drift, but can also maintain heterozygosity at higher
levels than expected in small populations. Thus, these biased fertilization patterns can
significantly counter the effects of genetic drift, and act to maintain genetic diversity in
small populations (Bensch et al. 2006; Frasier et al. 2013).
14. L427-431. This section should also touch upon ecological speciation and to what
extent understanding the molecular underpinning of fertilization may (or may not) be
important when speciation occurs via adaptation to different environments in sympatry
(i.e. especially in face of gene flow). In part L432-440 is perhaps intended to deal with
this, but this section I found confusing. Turner and Hoekstra 2008 (Causes and
consequences of the evolution of reproductive proteins) seems a useful reference here.
We did not want to dwell on any one topic for too long in this section, but rather to
highlight key areas where the analysis of these genes will likely be useful, and why. We
agree that the text, as it was, focused too heavily on sympatric speciation. Therefore, we
have added a sentence, as suggested by the review, to deal with allopatric scenarios.
Specifically, lines 495 to 497 now read “A similar process is likely also important in
many cases of allopatric speciation with gene flow, where differentiation at gamete
compatibility genes underlies the development of reproductive barriers.” However, we
have not added more details regarding ecological speciation and adaptation to different
environments. Partly for reasons explained in our response to critique #3, and also
because we think that readers will get the point from what is included, and therefore the
neither the message nor the clarity of the paper would be changed.
15. “5. Applications” section: Here a wider coverage of the molecular basis, including
protein modifications – particularly glycosylation, the role of environment, gene
expression and resulting dynamic interactions, as well as rapid evolution of reproductive
proteins should be better covered.
See response to critique #s 2 and 3.
16. Overall, given the many genes and their variable location in the sperm (detailed in
text), it would be useful to indicate those in one of the figures (Fig 4 seems most
suitable).
We have not added this. We think that doing so would make the figure too busy and
cluttered.
17. L173. Clarify for non-expert readers what “capacitate” means. (I had to google it
up).
We have not added this because this whole section explains the capacitation process, and
what occurs therein (specifically lines 204 to 214).
18. L174. Clarify what you refer to by “removal” of seminal fluid. Removal from where?
This sentence has been changed. Lines 198 to 200 now read “One of the key steps that
appears to trigger this process is the removal (in vitro) or dilution (in vivo) of seminal
fluid associated with the spermatozoa, which is a known inhibitor of capacitation (Chang
1957; Bedford 1970; Jaiswal et al. 2002).
19. L180. Clarify for non-expert readers what is meant by sperm becoming
“hyperactived”
Done. Lines 206 to 209 now read “Hyperactivation usually involves increased amplitude
and asymmetry in flagellar beating patterns, and appears necessary for the spermatozoa to
break free from their bonds with the oviductal epithelium, complete their journey toward
the egg, and penetrate the outer layers of the egg (Demott & Suarwez 1992; Stauss et al.
1995).”
20. L184. Is there are role for glycans in this process?
See response to critique #1.
21. L242. It is not clear to me what is meant by …the sperm is “built up” in the
perivitelline space. Please clarify for benefit of non-experts.
We have tried to clarify this. Lines 283 to 284 now read “The sperm instead built up in
the perivitelline space (the space in between the ZP and the plasma membrane of the
egg).”
22. L255. The evidence for the venom variation in these non-mammalian taxa calls for a
reference. Likewise, state the relevance of this.
As suggested, we have added appropriate references here. We have not added anything
new with respect to ‘relevance’, however. The rationale is that the next sentence explains
that this family of genes all have the same basic structure, hence why they are all
classified together as CRISP genes.
23. ZP and zona pellucida are used somewhat inconsistently through the text. Please
make use consistent.
We have tried make the usage appropriate to the context. For example, in sections or
paragraphs where we have initially made it clear that we are talking about the zona
pellucida, we will use ZP for the rest of the paragraph/section. However, in other areas of
the text, where this may not be clear, we use zona pellucida.
24. L275 .,,”is an other member of the CRISP family” is repetitive from L269-272.
True. This has been removed.
25. L288. What are the REJ genes ? (PKD genes are explained but REJ not)
Yes, we explain REJ in the subsequent sentence. Specifically, lines 332 to 333 read “A
region of PKDREJ is also homologous with the sea urchin REJ gene, which is involved
in sperm-egg interaction (Moy et al. 1996).”
26. L295. Replace “reproductive success” with “fertilization success”
This has been changed.
27. Figure 5 is not particularly informative and could be left out. The text, together with
the egg and sperm structures) is sufficiently clear.
Perhaps. However, we would like to include it because we think that it provides a useful
overview” of the process. One goal of this paper is to clarify what is known about the
complex process of fertilization. This figure seems helpful in this respect. Therefore, we
have left it in.
28. L313. You mean “has been identified”? Check wording.
Yes, this has been changed.
29. L318. Provide reference.
This has been added.
30. L350. Replace “individual” with female (else one can understand it means sterility of
the offspring.
This has been changed.
31. L405-408. As well as gene expression.
This has not been added. Including it here would only add confusion. Because we have
not discussed gene expression elsewhere (due to a lack of information, as explained in
our response above), including it here does not seem appropriate.
32. L410. Please provide reference.
This has been added.
33. L413. Clarify why fertilization is more likely between genetically dissimilar gametes
(for the readers benefit)
We do not know. We state simply that this is what has been found, but that more analyses
are required on gamete compatibility genes to understand the underlying mechanisms.
This is one goal of the paper – to show readers that the analysis of gamete compatibility
genes will likely be fruitful for addressing a broad range of important biological
questions, and therefore serve as motivation for them to do so.
