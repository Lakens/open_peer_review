The paper presents an original approach to compare human mobility models evaluating their
predictions on policy testing scenarios. The proposed methodology is applied to a case study
about the introduction of a Bus Rapid Transport system in the city of Teresina, Brazil.
Gravitational and radiation models are used to estimate the variation of the accessibility of
different zones, and to investigate the similarities and differences in their predictions.
The main contribution of this work is to introduce new metrics to evaluate human mobility
models at the urban scale, with a specific focus on applications and planning. Due to the lack of
data after the introduction of the BRT system, the variations of the flows and zone accessibilities
can only be simulated, so that it is not possible to fully test the models' predictions. However, this
does not affect the relevance of the results obtained.
Some technical aspects need further clarification and are listed below.
1) Additional information on the variables used in the models should be provided. In particular,
is the population, $P$, and employment, $E$, of each zone estimated from the survey data or the
census? With reference to Fig. 1 left, what is the unit of income?
2) On page 3: "This will be composed of eleven terminals connected through express bus
corridors"
In Fig.1 right I see only 8 terminals.
3) On page 4, $P_{ij}$ is defined as the population in zones included in a radius of distance
$d_{ij}$ and excluding those of zones $P_i$ and $P_j$. In this application it would be natural to
use the travel cost $c_{ij}$ instead of the distance $d_{ij}$ and estimate the intervening
opportunities $E_{ij}$ as the number of opportunities within travel time $c_{ij}$ from $i$. This is
similar to the approach of
Ren, Y., et al. "Predicting commuter flows in spatial networks using a radiation model based on
temporal ranges." Nature communications 5 (2013): 5347-5347.
4) On page 6: "To calibrate the parameters of the models we have used we used [typo] the
maximum likelihood method."
Eq. 4.1 is presented as a likelihood. Rather than a likelihood, it seems to be related to the
(negative) Kullback-Leibler divergence from the observed distribution of distances to the one of
models, where the term $- \sum_t p_o(t) log p_o(t)$ has been neglected, being independent of
the model's parameter. In this interpretation, the parameter $p$ that minimises the KL divergence
corresponds to the model whose distribution of distances best approximates the observed one.
5) What is the definition of variable $n$ in Eq. 4.2 ? Using the notation of Eq. 3.9 it probably is
$n_j = E_j$, and so $s_{ij} = E_{ij}$.
6) In the caption of Fig.2c, authors could add a remark on the fact that the black dashed curve is
the observed distribution of travel times based on the survey conducted before the introduction
of the BRT.
7) A more precise definition of the three categories on page 10 would be
Category 1: $\Delta r > 2$; Category 2: $-2 < \Delta r < 2$; Category 3: $\Delta r < -2$.
8) In the Discussion it should be highlighted the fact that in measuring the new accessibility it has
been assumed that the spatial distribution of population and employment do not change after the
3
introduction of the BRT. As a result, this approach may not be appropriate to estimate variations
of accessibility a long time after the introduction of the BRT, when it is likely to expect that the
resident population and employment would also change.

This article evaluated the abilities of applying gravitational model and radiation model for intra-
urban mobility predication and accessibility assessment. Unlike existing literature, the authors
chose the optimal models based on the similarity between the empirical travel duration
distribution and the estimated travel duration distribution. In this way, I have concerns on the
derived parameter for the optimal models, since the similarity between the two show no details
of the flow between each pair of parcels. It can be somehow misleading. I would suggest the
authors to calculate the Sorensen index between the observed flow and the predicted flow for
those pair of parcels that have observed data. It will help readers to evaluate their models.
Therefore, I would recommend a “major revision” for potential publication of this research work.

I understand that the survey data does not contain trips from every zone to every other. Yet, as
for me, you can still calculate the Sorensen's index between the observed trips and the estimated
8
trips for those pairs of zones that are contained in the survey. It will provide more solid evidence
of the model performance. Put it simple, my major concern is that the model, which is
fundamental for comparing the OD distribution on the true policy testing scenario, might be not
appropriate (or optimal). I therefore insist that the Sorensen's index should be presented in the

Our Reply:
Given the concerns of the reviewer we have changed the calibration process, and have indeed
used Sorensens Index. This yielded slightly different values for the parameters of the gravity
models, but not for the Extended Radiation model. However we were forced given the new
values to repeat all the simulations and produce new results. Despite the new parameters the
results we had obtained are still valid as the reviewer can see from the new figures, and therefore
the structure of the manuscript has not been changed.

1 REVIEWER 1
We thank the reviewer for his comments, which have helped increase the quality
of our paper. We will address each point separately, showing explicitly any new
or modified text introduced in the corrected version.
1) Additional information on the variables used in the models
should be provided. In particular, is the population, P , and employ-
ment, E, of each zone estimated from the survey data or the census?
With reference to Fig. 1 left, what is the unit of income?
Both the P and employment E are taken from the Census Data provided by
the city council of Teresina. In order to make this clearer we have moved the
section where we introduce the data sources, right after the case study section,
and have added the following line
The population and employment data are taken from the census provided by
Teresina’s city council.
Moreover the Brazilian Real has been added as a unit of income.
2) On page 3: ”This will be composed of eleven terminals connected
through express bus corridors” In Fig.1 right I see only 8 terminals.
We thank the reviewer spotting this error. The figure was wrong, we have
now uploaded a new corrected one.
3) On page 4, Pij is defined as the population in zones included in a
radius of distance dij and excluding those of zones Pi and Pj . In this
application it would be natural to use the travel cost cij instead of
the distance dij and estimate the intervening opportunities Eij as the
number of opportunities within travel time cij from i. This is similar
to the approach of Ren, Y., et al. ”Predicting commuter flows in
spatial networks using a radiation model based on temporal ranges.”
Nature communications 5 (2013): 5347-5347.
Actually this is exactly what we have done. For some reason we have not
explained this properly in the text. We have now added the new citation we
1
were not aware of and the following text
”As previously said, for our analysis we have used the expected travel time
to measure the cost of travelling from one zone to the another. Therefore as in
ren2014 predicting Eij here represents the opportunities within travel time cij
from i.”.
4) On page 6: ”To calibrate the parameters of the models we have
used we used [typo] the maximum likelihood method.” Eq. 4.1 is
presented as a likelihood. Rather than a likelihood, it seems to be
related to the (negative) Kullback-Leibler divergence from the ob-
served
P distribution of distances to the one of models, where the term
- t po (t)logpo (t) has been neglected, being independent of the model’s
parameter. In this interpretation, the parameter p that minimises the
KL divergence corresponds to the model whose distribution of dis-
tances best approximates the observed one.
The term likelihood indeed has different meanings which depend on the con-
text. Given our context (presence of modelled and real data), we are interested
in calibrating the parameters, in order for the ”likelihood” of the model repro-
ducing the observed data being maximum.
In this case the Likelihood is a measure of the extent to which a sample
provides support for a particular value of a parameter in the model. Mathemat-
ically this corresponds to maximising the following equation
hlog(pmodel (<U+03B3>))ipdata (1)
with respect to the parameter <U+03B3>. In order to make this clearer we have added, a
reference to a previous work where we had done the same procedure, and added
the following text (in red)
As we have seen above the survey used to calibrate the models counts only
138 households, and therefore does not contain information on trips from ev-
ery zone to every other. For each origin zone, we only have information on
trips to a limited number of destinations. This implies that we cannot cali-
brate the models using the common part of commuters based on the Sorensen’s
index [sorensen1948method] as done in previous comparisons. We therefore ex-
tract the trip duration distribution of the bus trips contained in the dataset
[Strano2008] pdata (t), and for each value of the parameter which we generically
indicate as <U+03B3> (a for the extended radiation and ß for the gravity model) we
measure the distribution of the predicted duration of the trips pmodel (t, <U+03B3>). To
calibrate the parameters of the models we have used we used the maximum
likelihood method, (exactly as done in [pio2017spatial]) which consists in tun-
ing the parameters in order to maximise the likelihood that the model model
could generate the observed data. This can also be seen as choosing the param-
eters’ values with more support in the data. Mathematically this translates in
maximizing with respect to the parameter <U+03B3> the equation
5) What is the definition of variable n in Eq. 4.2 ? Using the notation

of Eq. 3.9 it probably is nj = Ej , and so sij = Eij
Yes indeed. We apologise for the typo, it is now corrected.
6) In the caption of Fig.2c, authors could add a remark on the fact
that the black dashed curve is the observed distribution of travel
times based on the survey conducted before the introduction of the
BRT.
We have now added the following text in the caption:
In (c) we compare the bus trip duration distribution found in the survey before
the introduction of the BRT, black dashed curve, with what comes out from the
models once the parameters are optimized.
7) A more precise definition of the three categories on page 10 would
be Category 1: <U+2206>r > 2; Category 2: -2 < <U+2206>r < 2; Category 3: <U+2206>r < -2.
We have now added an explanation in the definition of the categories. This
now reads:
The red and blue areas highlight the zones for which the predictions vary con-
siderably (k<U+2206>rk > 2), which are those whose characteristics we want to analyse.
We have therefore divided the zones into
• Category 1: zones that rank higher when using the double-constrained
gravitational model, <U+2206>ri > 2.
• Category 2: zones whose rank is similar when using the two models,
k<U+2206>ri k < 2.
• Category 3: zones that rank higher when using the extended radiation
model, <U+2206>ri < -2.
8) In the Discussion it should be highlighted the fact that in
measuring the new accessibility it has been assumed that the spatial
distribution of population and employment do not change after the
introduction of the BRT. As a result, this approach may not be ap-
propriate to estimate variations of accessibility a long time after the
introduction of the BRT, when it is likely to expect that the resident
population and employment would also change.
This comment is absolutely correct, and holds for most of the approaches used in
this field. The predictions are generally valid only immediately after the intro-
duction of the tested network, and give an idea of the direction of the evolution
of the urban system. Indeed by varying the accessibility of an area everything
else is bound to change as well, but these complex non linear relationships be-
tween infrastructure, house prices, employment and population distribution go
beyond the scope of this work. We now clearly state this in the paper. In the
Methods section (subsection Measures of Accessibility )

Of course the variation of accessibility induced by changing the cost matrix
will have an impact on the population and employment distributions. A zone
with an increased accessibility will see the house prices rise, which will effect the
resident population and consequently the employment. Despite these secondary
effects definitely playing an important role in the planning of such public in-
terventions, they emerge as a result of complex non linear interactions and are
therefore hard to predict. For this reason their description goes beyond the
scope of this work, where we have concentrated on the immediate impact of the
transportation network.
and in the discussion
The results we present are valid only immediately after the introduction of
the BRT network, and fail to describe the system the more it adapts to the
changes. This is because accessibility, population and employment distribution
are inter-dependent, and changing once of them changes all the others. In this
work we have not taken into account these variations and have only described
how the new transportation network would impact the accessibility distribution.
We leave the rest of the analysis to future work.

2 REVIEWER 2
This article evaluated the abilities of applying gravitational model and radiation
model for intra-urban mobility predication and accessibility assessment. Unlike
existing literature, the authors chose the optimal models based on the similar-
ity between the empirical travel duration distribution and the estimated travel
duration distribution. In this way, I have concerns on the derived parameter
for the optimal models, since the similarity between the two show no details of
the flow between each pair of parcels. It can be somehow misleading. I would
suggest the authors to calculate the Sorensen index between the observed flow
and the predicted flow for those pair of parcels that have observed data. It will
help readers to evaluate their models. Therefore, I would recommend a major
revision for potential publication of this research work.
We understand the reviewers concerns about the calibration of the models and
we do agree that the Soersen Index would have been a better choice. Unfortu-
nately we cannot use the common part of commuters given the incompleteness
of the survey we have used to fill our Origin- Destination matrix. This is clearly
stated in the text in section 4.A:
”As we have seen above the survey used to calibrate the models counts only
138 households, and therefore does not contain information on trips from every
zone to every other. For each origin zone, we only have information on trips
to a limited number of destinations. This implies that we cannot calibrate the
models using the common part of commuters based on the Sorensen’s index
sorensen1948method as done in previous comparisons Lenormand2012 , Lenor-
4
mand2016, Yang2014, Masucci2013”
Moveover, the true novelty of our work does not lie on the comparing the models
on the performance in reproducing the origin - destination matrix, but in com-
paring them on a true policy testing scenario. The problem we are describing
and the data used to tackle it are those actually used by Teresina’s city council
to test the cost/benefits of the new BRT network. We have now added a new
part in the introduction to help clearly state this point:
In 2008, the municipality of Teresina approved its Transport and Mobility Mas-
ter Plan which proposes a new system of public transport in the city. It relies
on an Origin-Destination survey of trip making conducted in 2007 which was
developed to analyse travel patterns and predict future scenarios [Strano2008].
Despite the survey not being ideal for the detailed comparison of the model, as
it does not provide information on the commuters’ behavior in all zones of the
city, it is an excellent way of comparing the two models on a true policy testing
scenario. To our knowledge the models have never been compared in such a
manner.
If the reviewer feels we have to address this point further, we will be happy
to do so, but unfortunately given the nature of our input data we cannot satisfy
his requirement of using the Soersen Index.
