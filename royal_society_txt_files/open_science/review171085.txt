This is a nicely written paper very relevant at a time when we are debating use of P-values. I have
some major points and some minor points
Major Points:
(1) The authors need to clarify what is the original contribution of the paper. As I was reading
this paper, it seemed to me all the points made in this paper already exist in the literature and the
author is putting them together in an integrated landscape. The author needs to clarify whether
that is the goal of the paper or there are a couple of new points the author is trying to
make/highlight that have not appeared in the literature. This could be the P-equal versus P-less
than argument or just releasing R codes to calculate the prior, likelihood, posterior odds
mapping, but this needs to be clarified what is new.
(2) Reading some sections of the paper, I was confused whether the author is considering the
issue of multiple testing versus testing a single hypothesis at P=0.05. The references to the
Wacholder (2004) paper with False Positive Report Probability made me feel we are in the
genomewide association study setting where the search is agnostic and over multiple hypotheses.
It will be good if the paper clarifies at the onset that the conversation is about single hypotheses
testing and relegate discussion of multiple testing, FDR to a separate section.
(3) Replication studies: The role of replication studies is paramount in modern science even if we
reduce the P-value threshold. This needs to be incorporated.
(4) On page 4, equation (1) should be posterior odds. I found the use of the word odds ratio very
confusing. Perhaps it is best to introduce some notations like in equation A8. Otherwise
equations (1) and (2) seem vague.
(5) In connection with the authors argument of P-equal versus less than, it will be great to discuss
the choice of alternative and critical region, a point null versus a composite null. As Fisher had
argued, do we need to think about a specific alternative?
(6) What is the recommendation then, to use P=0.00045 to maintain a FPR of 5%. I would think
this really depends on the study. The prior probability for null hypothesis being 0.1 may be
reasonable in some studies but in agnostic searches this number will be much much smaller.
Perhaps the authors can add another paragraph on this issue?

This work by Prof. Colquhoun is extremely timely, and the subject of paramount importance. As
this has been up as a preprint for some time, I have read both this version and the prior revisions,
and am pleased to see how the paper has evolved. As this is effectively a 7th revision, the vast
majority of my points are relatively minor, and designed to make the paper slightly more
accessible to a non-expert reader, as I firmly agree it is important that all scientists take home the
central message of this work.
(1) In the introduction, it would be worthwhile to clarify a subtle but important point -
presumably, Prof Colquhoun is talking about the specific examples of an experiment being
conducted without any clear mechanistic predictions (or priors) considered before the
experiment. For example, experiments done under the guise of 'hypothesis generation' rather
than 'hypothesis testing'. This is perfectly reasonable in biology and lab science, but may not
translate directly to other sciences - for example, physics, where mechanistic theory is used to
predict experimental outcome. I appreciate this is a subtle point, but it might be pertinent to
explicitly clarify this.
(2) "The most common (mis)interpretations are “the P value is the probability that your results
occurred by chance”. Or “the P value is the probability that the null hypothesis is true”. Both of
these are disastrously wrong [5]. The latter definition is
obviously wrong because the P value is calculated on the premise that the null hypothesis is true,
so it can’t possibly tell you about the truth of the null hypothesis."
Very true, but I would suggest making the refutation of the former explictly clear too.
(3) There appears to be a typo in the caption for figure 1 (strike out clear) - also, y1 isn't marked
and should be.
(4) Eq (1) is good and not intimidating to a general audience, but would it be worthwhile to
include the 'classical' form of Baye's theorem and explain what it means?
(5) As it stands, part 3 is confusing and should be reworded - partially this is the reliance on
appendix A and prior work, but I think there are some things that require re-phrasing. The
question has apparently been long discussed in statistical literature, so it would be appropriate to
reference some previous discussions in the first paragraph - such as section 10 of the author's
previous work.
In fact, to grasp this section I had to go to the author's 2014 paper - to my mind, p= should be
understood as a precisely defined value; the chances of a simulated t-test producing this result
exactly might be rather low. However, in the 2014 paper, the p= is actually an envelope (between
0.045 and 0.05 in the example) so that a p= interpretation actually means something very close to
the arbitrary p cut off, whereas p < interpretation means values of p less than this. In essence, I
assume Prof Colquhoun is defining p= as 'close to' the threshold, but this terminology is
4
confusing and it should be explicitly stated it is not a true equality in the classical sense. If I have
misunderstood, I would appreciate clarification.
(6) I quite like the discussion section, and would like to see it expanded. These of course are only
suggestions, and can be employed (or ignored!) as the author sees fit. As the problem of
reproducibility in science is at the heart of this work, it might be pertinent to expand on how this
work should inform experimenters and policy makers. Some of this could be achieved by
discussing the emerging field of meta-research, and certainly, this work qualifies as part of that.
The work of John Ioannadis has been mentioned, but especially relevant might be the work of
Smaldino and McElreath (http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/9/160384) in this
journal, which suggests our obsession with metrics can have a negative impact of research
quality. A another recent pre-print that might be relevant is the work of Grimes, Bauch and
Ioannadis (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/17/139063) which makes similar
arguments, and also shows by way of a simple model that fields with a a high-false positive rate
tend to have lower reproducibility, and that rewarding scientists on publication metrics alone is
detrimental to research quality.
What would be really interesting is to expand upon how alternatives might be employed. The
crux of this paper is that p value can be useful, IF correctly interpretted but alas it is frequently
misunderstood or outright manipulated. Papers like this serve to improve statistical fluency, and
that is in itself fantastic. But aside from this, what does the author think might help improve
thing? or example, should we be more focused on effect size than p-value? This is certainly an
argument put forward in some medical literature

Appendix A
Response to teviewers
Thanks to both reviewers for their comments, which have helped to clarify the paper
(and for not insisting that I become a subjective Bayesian). My responses are
indented, below.
David Colquhoun
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This is a nicely written paper very relevant at a time when we are debating use of P-
values. I have some major points and some minor points
Major Points:
1. The authors need to clarify what is the original contribution of the paper. As I was
reading this paper, it seemed to me all the points made in this paper already exist in
the literature and the author is putting them together in an integrated landscape. The
author needs to clarify whether that is the goal of the paper or there are a couple of
new points the author is trying to make/highlight that have not appeared in the
literature. This could be the P-equal versus P-less than argument or just releasing R
codes to calculate the prior, likelihood, posterior odds mapping, but this needs to be
clarified what is new.
What’s new? I’m not aware of any other paper that discusses and compares
the p-equals and the p-less-than approach in such detail, or provides both R
scripts and a web calculator to calculate both (the web calculator was written
after the paper was submitted but it is described in the revised version and
illustrated in Figs 4 and 6 of the revised version. Also, almost every other
paper deals only with large samples, using the z statistic, whereas I use
Student’s t statistic so results are relevant to the small samples that are
common in lab research.
2. Reading some sections of the paper, I was confused whether the author is
considering the issue of multiple testing versus testing a single hypothesis at P=0.05.
The references to the Wacholder (2004) paper with False Positive Report Probability
made me feel we are in the genomewide association study setting where the search
is agnostic and over multiple hypotheses. It will be good if the paper clarifies at the
onset that the conversation is about single hypotheses testing and relegate
discussion of multiple testing, FDR to a separate section.
The question to be answered is stated (and emphasised in a box) right at the
start of the paper. Multiple comparisons were mentioned at the end of
Appendix A1. But for the sake of clarity, I have moved that to the introduction.
I added this paragraph
“The problem of multiple comparisons is often an important source of false discoveries, but
isn’t discussed in this paper. It is worth noting that all the methods for correcting for multiple
comparisons aim to correct the type 1 error only. The result is therefore a (corrected) P
value, so it will still underestimate the false positive risk, for the reasons to be described.”
I think that this, with the opening question, should make it clear that I’m not
talking about multiple comparisons.
(3) Replication studies: The role of replication studies is paramount in modern
science even if we reduce the P-value threshold. This needs to be incorporated.
This was stressed several times in the submitted version, in the conclusions
(section 9)
Marginal P values are fine as a signal to investigate further. In the end, the only
solution is replication
Calculation of the prior seems to me to be a better way than specifying an arbitrary
prior in order to calculate an FPR. In the end, only replication will resolve arguments.
(4) Always be aware that no method exists for rigorous inductive argument [5]. In
practice, judgement, and especially replication, is always needed. There is no
computer program that can automatically make a judgement for you.
I have added to the abstract the following sentence, to make sure that this
point is appreciated.
“In the end, precise inductive inference is impossible and replication is the
only way to be sure.”
(4) On page 4, equation (1) should be posterior odds. I found the use of the word
odds ratio very confusing. Perhaps it is best to introduce some notations like in
equation A8. Otherwise equations (1) and (2) seem vague.
Point taken. My aim was to keep the body of the paper as free of equations
as humanly possible. Experience has shown that this increases the
readership vastly. I have changed this section now to read as follows
.” . . can be written thus.
posterior odds ratio = likelihood ratio X prior odds (1)
(see eq, A8 for a more precise definition), The word ‘prior’ signifies ‘before the
experiment; and ‘posterior’ signifies after the experiment. So the likelihood ratio
measures the evidence provided by the experiment. Often we shall prefer to speak of
probabilities rather than odds. The probability that a hypothesis is true is related to
the odds ratio in favour of the hypothesis being true, thus
<U+0001D45C><U+0001D451><U+0001D451><U+0001D460>
<U+0001D45D><U+0001D45F><U+0001D45C><U+0001D44F><U+0001D44E><U+0001D44F><U+0001D456><U+0001D459><U+0001D456><U+0001D461><U+0001D466> =
<U+0001D45C><U+0001D451><U+0001D451><U+0001D460> + 1
(2)
For example, if the…”
I hope this is a sufficiently good compromise.
(5) In connection with the authors argument of P-equal versus less than, it will be
great to discuss the choice of alternative and critical region, a point null versus a
composite null. As Fisher had argued, do we need to think about a specific
alternative?
I’m puzzled by this comment because the alternative hypothesis is introduced
at many points, and it is illustrated explicitly in Figure 1. In section 2. Here are
some examples
In order to calculate the false positive risk the null hypothesis is not enough. We
need also an alternative hypothesis. This is needed because, as Berkson said in
1942 [6]
In section 4
In order to calculate the FPR we need to postulate an alternative to the null
hypothesis
And later
The likelihood of a hypothesis is not interpretable on its own: we can interpret only the
relative likelihood of two hypotheses. This is called the likelihood ratio. In the example
used here (and in ref [1]), the two hypotheses are the null hypothesis (the true
difference between means is zero) and the alternative hypothesis (the true
difference between means is one).
In section 5
and the probability of the observations under the alternative hypothesis is proportional
to the ordinate labelled y1 in Figure 1.
And
If we observe P = 0.05, for which power = 0.78, as in Figure 1, the likelihood ratio for
the alternative versus the null is 2.76 (see Table 1 and Appendix A2 for details)
And
If we observe P = 0.05, for which power = 0.78, as in Figure 1, the likelihood ratio for
the alternative versus the null is 2.76 (see Table 1 and Appendix A2 for details)
In appendix A1
The null hypothesis is that the true effect size is zero and the alternative hypothesis is
(for a two-sided test) that the true effect size is not zero
and many more times
(6) What is the recommendation then, to use P=0.00045 to maintain a FPR of 5%. I
would think this really depends on the study. The prior probability for null hypothesis
being 0.1 may be reasonable in some studies but in agnostic searches this number
will be much much smaller. Perhaps the authors can add another paragraph on this
issue?
Well the p=0.00045 certainly serves as a warning against hubris. But the main
purpose of the paper, as stated in the abstract, is to advocate the view
It is recommended that the terms “significant” and “non-significant” should never be
used. Rather, P values should be supplemented by specifying the prior probability
that would be needed to produce a specified (e.g. 5%) false positive risk.
I have added this to the introduction also, to make sure that it’s clear from the
outset.

work.
(1) In the introduction, it would be worthwhile to clarify a subtle but important point -
presumably, Prof Colquhoun is talking about the specific examples of an experiment
being conducted without any clear mechanistic predictions (or priors) considered
before the experiment. For example, experiments done under the guise of
'hypothesis generation' rather than 'hypothesis testing'. This is perfectly reasonable
in biology and lab science, but may not translate directly to other sciences - for
example, physics, where mechanistic theory is used to predict experimental
outcome. I appreciate this is a subtle point, but it might be pertinent to explicitly
clarify this.
This is an interesting point. The whole argument is conducted in terms of
testing the difference between two independent means. The question of how
much the results apply to P values obtained in other ways remains open.
Since the p value is always defined in the same way, it will always be subject
to the error of the transpaoed conditional, so I imagine that similar problems
will occur with any P value whatsoever. However, I have not investigated
other cases so it did not feel safe to mention this idea. I recall Jon
Butterworth giving In the Guardian!) an accurate description of the transposed
conditional when referring to the discovery of the Higgs boson.
(2) "The most common (mis)interpretations are “the P value is the probability that
your results occurred by chance”. Or “the P value is the probability that the null
hypothesis is true”. Both of these are disastrously wrong [5]. The latter definition is
obviously wrong because the P value is calculated on the premise that the null
hypothesis is true, so it can’t possibly tell you about the truth of the null hypothesis."
Very true, but I would suggest making the refutation of the former explictly clear too.
Good point. I added
The former is wrong because in order to calculate the probability that the result
occurred by chance, we need the total number of positive tests, not only those that
are found when the null hypothesis is true (see Figure 2 in ref [1]).
This would be clearer of Fig 2 was included here, but there is a limit to the
amount of self-plagiarism that I can do.
(3) There appears to be a typo in the caption for figure 1 (strike out clear) - also, y1
isn't marked and should be.
Sorry, I can’t see a typo, and y1 is there.
(4) Eq (1) is good and not intimidating to a general audience, but would it be
worthwhile to include the 'classical' form of Baye's theorem and explain what it
means?
It was my aim to have an absolute minimum of equations in the body of the
text. Experience has shown that this increases the readership enormously.
But I have added some clarification, by referring to the full equation in the
appendix, and by explaining prior and posterior.
.” . . can be written thus.
posterior odds ratio = likelihood ratio X prior odds (1)
(see eq, A8 for a more precise definition), Then word prior signifies ‘before the
experiment; and posterior signifies after the experiment. So the likelihood ratio
measures the evidence provided by the experiment. Often we shall prefer to speak of
probabilities rather than odds. The probability that a hypothesis is true is related to
the odds ratio in favour of the hypothesis being true, thus
(5) As it stands, part 3 is confusing and should be reworded - partially this is the
reliance on appendix A and prior work, but I think there are some things that require
re-phrasing. The question has apparently been long discussed in statistical literature,
so it would be appropriate to reference some previous discussions in the first
paragraph - such as section 10 of the author's previous work.
In fact, to grasp this section I had to go to the author's 2014 paper - to my mind, p=
should be understood as a precisely defined value; the chances of a simulated t-test
producing this result exactly might be rather low. However, in the 2014 paper, the p=
is actually an envelope (between 0.045 and 0.05 in the example) so that a p=
interpretation actually means something very close to the arbitrary p cut off, whereas
p < interpretation means values of p less than this. In essence, I assume Prof
Colquhoun is defining p= as 'close to' the threshold, but this terminology is confusing
and it should be explicitly stated it is not a true equality in the classical sense. If I
have misunderstood, I would appreciate clarification.
I have inserted ref 22 in the first paragraph, though actually the distinction is
older, at least to Edwards, Lindman & Savage (1963). The problem is that the
distinction is buried in mathematical jargon in these references, and it’s
unlikely that most non-statisticians would appreciate the distinction by reading
them. I was disappointed that the reviewer found this section hard because it
was my aim to make it simpler than existing accounts. As you point out, the
simulation approach makes the distinction obvious and this is described
already towards the end of section 3, and in section 4. I have moved a
reference to this approach to near the start of section 3, in the hope that this
makes it easier to follow. This now reads
This is an old, but often neglected question. . Although this discussion has gone on
for decades in the statistical literature (eg ref [22]), it is unknown to most users. It
was discussed in section 10 of ref [1]/
In fact the R programs and the web calculator do the calculations for the
exactly equal case. Of course the probability if observing a P value exactly
equal to 0.05 (or whatever) is infinitesimally small (so for simulations a small
interval must be used), but it’s proportional to the probability densities (y0 and
y1 in Figure 1) and the proportionality constant cancels when the likelihood
ratio is found. To clarify this I added, near the end of section 3.
Although the distinction between the p-less-than case and the p-equals case is most
easily understood by simulations, one aim of this paper is to supply code that
calculates the p-equals case exactly (rather than the p-close-to case that is all that
can be done by simulation), as explained in Appendix A2.
(6) I quite like the discussion section, and would like to see it expanded. These of
course are only suggestions, and can be employed (or ignored!) as the author sees
fit. As the problem of reproducibility in science is at the heart of this work, it might be
pertinent to expand on how this work should inform experimenters and policy
makers. Some of this could be achieved by discussing the emerging field of meta-
research, and certainly, this work qualifies as part of that. The work of John
Ioannadis has been mentioned, but especially relevant might be the work of
Smaldino and McElreath (http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/9/160384)
in this journal, which suggests our obsession with metrics can have a negative
impact of research quality. A another recent pre-print that might be relevant is the
work of Grimes, Bauch and Ioannadis
(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/17/139063) which makes similar
arguments, and also shows by way of a simple model that fields with a a high-false
positive rate tend to have lower reproducibility, and that rewarding scientists on
publication metrics alone is detrimental to research quality.
There has been a spate of such papers recently. I’ve said it endlessly myself.
I added some references to the discussion (including Smaldino & McElreath).
This paper addresses a very limited question: how do you interpret the result of a
single unbiased test of significance. It makes no attempt to estimate the science-
wide false positive rate. The increased awareness if the problem of reproducibility
has led to many attempts to assess the scale of the problem. Since most of these
papers use the p-less-than approach to calculate false positive risks, the problem
may be even worse than they suggest. See, for example [9] [29] [30] [33] [42] [43].
What would be really interesting is to expand upon how alternatives might be
employed. The crux of this paper is that p value can be useful, IF correctly
interpretted but alas it is frequently misunderstood or outright manipulated. Papers
like this serve to improve statistical fluency, and that is in itself fantastic. But aside
from this, what does the author think might help improve thing? or example, should
we be more focused on effect size than p-value? This is certainly an argument put
forward in some medical literature
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3444174/).
I had hoped that I’d made it clear what should be done, e.g in the abstract
It is recommended that the terms “significant” and “non-significant” should never be
used. Rather, P values should be supplemented by specifying the prior probability
that would be needed to produce a specified (e.g. 5%) false positive risk. It may also
be helpful to specify the minimum false positive risk associated with the observed P
value.
The same message is repeated throughout the paper. E.g. under conclusions
So here is what I think should be done.
(1) Continue to give P values and confidence intervals. These numbers should be
given because they are familiar and easy to calculate, not because they are very
helpful in preventing you from making a fool of yourself. They do not provide good
evidence for or against the null hypothesis. Giving confidence intervals has the
benefit of focussing attention on the effect size. But it must be made clear that there
is not a 95% chance that the true value lies within the confidence limits you find.
Confidence limits give the same sort of evidence against the null hypothesis as P
values, i.e, not much.
(2) I propose that the best way of indicating the strength of evidence provided by a
single P value is to use the reverse Bayesian method (section 7). That is, calculate
what prior probability would be needed to achieve a specified false positive risk (e,g.
use calc-prior.R, or the web calculator [44])
