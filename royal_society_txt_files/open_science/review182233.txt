This was a pleasure to review as the authors have addressed well the initial comments from the
three referees from their RSC Advances submission. A few comments though.
Please add the reaction temperature to the paper abstract.
It would have been informative for the authors to have conducted this reaction with the H-
CubePro, say at 150ºC, which may have been accessible to them as one of the authors (Jones) is
cited as at ThalesNano.
It is not clear how the level of leach metals were determined - is this by ICP MS? This should be
mentioned din the body text.
Please provide an experimental procedure section.

The authors describe a continuous flow method to screen and optimize heterogeneous catalytic
conditions for the conversion of methyl- and ethyl- levulinate esters to gamma-valerolactone
3
(GVL). Key to this process is the H-Cube hydrogenation system. One benefit of the optimised
method is that the H2 mediated reduction of both levulinate esters proceeds in water and
alcoholic solvents (methanol and ethanol). The authors have diligently addressed the reviewer
comments from previous iterations of the manuscript, and these efforts have presumably
improved the previously submitted versions of the manuscript. However, a number of
inadequacies remain:
1. The scalability of the process is not discussed. The practical synthesis of GVL mandates multi-
tonne reduction of methyl- and ethyl- levulinate. Did the authors perform gram scale (tens of
grams) synthesis to validate the optimized process?
2. The SI is not instructive, and the Tables contain acronyms that are not adequately described. It
is therefore difficult to deconvolute the data and the SI is of very limited value in current format.
3. In the SI, Table S1 appears to be directly copied from the marketing brochure and offers no
scientific value within the context of the manuscript.
The study does make a minor contribution to the field of continuous flow hydrogenation in
describing a method to screen the reduction methyl- and ethyl- levulinate esters to gamma-
valerolactone (GVL). However, the H-Cube is a well-established laboratory scale technology and
the use of this apparatus for high throughput screening of heterogenous catalysis (CatCarts) was
rapidly established following the inception of the H-Cube device. Of greater concern is the lack of
innovative chemistry in the manuscript. For example, the authors had an opportunity to develop
a multi-step process to furnish GVL derivatives in a single unit operation or to develop a scalable
process for GVL. Given that very narrow focus of the manuscript, I conclude that the manuscript
is beyond the scope of the journal. I recommend that the manuscript be considered for
publication in a specialised engineering journal to ensure better alignment with the journal scope
and readership.

Review comments on RSOS-182233
This resubmitted manuscript has answered most of the issues proposed by previous reviewers,
and some revisions were given in the revised manuscript. Although the scientific novelty of this
work is indeed not so obvious, the researches of the conversion of levulinic esters to GVL on a
continuous reactor were attempted and the results are helpful to promote the real application of
the synthesis of GVL through this reactor. So this work is more meaningful in viewpoint of
engineering. Therefore, I recommend this work published in Royal Society Open Science after
Minor Revision.
1. The author claimed that the addition of acids could promote the formation of GVL in two
places in the manuscript but no experiment data were provided. The evidences should be given.
2. A continuous loss of Ru may happen. The authors should detect the Ru content in the catalyst
after used for 220 min, not just Ru content in the reaction solution. This may provide more
explanations on the loss of activity during long time reaction.
3. The unit in x axe in figure 6 is wrong, min instead of h.

Comments to the Author(s)
This was a pleasure to review as the authors have addressed well the initial comments

Please add the reaction temperature to the paper abstract.
The reaction temperature was added to the abstract’s text.
It would have been informative for the authors to have conducted this reaction with the
H-CubePro, say at 150ºC, which may have been accessible to them as one of the
authors (Jones) is cited as at ThalesNano.
Thank you for this suggestion; however, the H-Cube Pro® was not accessible for these
experiments. Obviously, higher applied reaction temperature could result in higher
conversion rates at same pressures and/or could allow to reduce total system pressure.
It was demonstrated in our previous paper regarding the hydrogenation of levulinic acid
(RSC Adv. 2013, 3, 16283.)
It is not clear how the level of leach metals were determined - is this by ICP MS? This
should be mentioned din the body text.
The metal leaching was determined by ICP-MS. The body text was extended and the
analytical procedures were detailed in the revised section of “Materials and Methods”.
Please provide an experimental procedure section.
The section “Materials and Methods” was revised and extended with a detailed
experimental and analytical procedure.
What is the time (flow rate / volume of reagents) to catalyst exhaustion?
Checked. The total reaction time for the investigation of catalyst’s stability was 220
min. The flow rate (1 mL/min) was indicated in the caption of Figure 6.

Thank you for your comments.
1. The scalability of the process is not discussed. The practical synthesis of GVL
mandates multi-tonne reduction of methyl- and ethyl- levulinate. Did the authors
perform gram scale (tens of grams) synthesis to validate the optimized process?
Authors agree that the scalability is very important and crucial issue of a proposed
conversion process. However, in the absence of laboratory scale experiments, we
cannot evaluate the feasibility of a discussed conversion technology. The basic research
activities focusing on continuous biomass valorization processes typically performed
on laboratory gram-scale. Please see cited studies. The primarily aim of our work was
the evaluation of GVL’s production from levulinic acid esters in water or corresponding
alcohols under continuous conditions using water as hydrogen source. H-Cube system
with higher capacity have developed by ThalesNano and the scale up studies will be
subject our further studies.
2. The SI is not instructive, and the Tables contain acronyms that are not adequately
described. It is therefore difficult to deconvolute the data and the SI is of very limited
value in current format.
3. In the SI, Table S1 appears to be directly copied from the marketing brochure and
offers no scientific value within the context of the manuscript.
The SI was revised as follows: 1) The Reviewer is right, the Table S1 contained
technical details of H-Cube system, therefore, it was deleted. 2) Abbreviations were
added to the SI file for better understanding. 3) Table S10 was revised for better
understanding.
The study does make a minor contribution to the field of continuous flow hydrogenation
in describing a method to screen the reduction methyl- and ethyl- levulinate esters to
gamma-valerolactone (GVL). However, the H-Cube is a well-established laboratory

Thank you for your kind recommendation.
1. The author claimed that the addition of acids could promote the formation of GVL in
two places in the manuscript but no experiment data were provided. The evidences
should be given.
The conversion of MHP to GVL by the addition of HCl was established by GC-MS and
NMR technique. The corresponding sentences were modified and the 1H NMR of MHP
and EHP were added to the experimental part for better understanding.
2. A continuous loss of Ru may happen. The authors should detect the Ru content in
the catalyst after used for 220 min, not just Ru content in the reaction solution. This
may provide more explanations
on the loss of activity during long time reaction.
Thank you for your comment. I understand that the determination of the
ruthenium content of the catalyst provide information for mass balance of Ru. While
metal leaching could be detected in the first two samples, the Ru loss became negligible
(<0.2 ppb) after 20 min reaction time. Authors would like to note that no any decrease
in the activity was detected for 220 min reaction time (figure 6). The conversion values
of methyl levulinate were >99.9%, therefore the negligible change of Ru content had
no effect on the catalyst activity.
On the other hand the CatCart is a commercially available product of
ThalesNano Nanotechnology Inc. For comparable measurements the Ru content would
have been determined before the reaction and after the reaction. Because the non-used
catalyst is not available (no samples were taken before reaction), the measurements
cannot be compared.
3. The unit in x axe in figure 6 is wrong, min instead of h.
The title of x axis of Figure 6 was corrected.
