This manuscript addresses an open question in our understanding of how animals, specifically
bats, react to distress calls of conspecifics: does the context in which the distress call is emitted
impact the response of other individuals? In this study, the authors assess if greater sac-winged
bats, Saccopteryx bilineata, respond differently to the distress call of a conspecific that is emitted
within a roost versus near a roost versus at a foraging site. The study is novel and provides
insight into how bats behaviorally respond to a conspecific’s distress call. My comments
primarily focus on some clarification within the text and more clearly delineating what was done
to compare reactions to conspecific versus heterospecific calls.
Lines 59-61: What have the majority of these past studies found? Is the problem that most past
studies have found no impact of distress call playbacks on bat behavior? The wording in the
parenthesized section suggests that is the case. If so, that needs to be more clearly stated.

Lines 61-66: This end part of the paragraph with insectivores vs frugivores and solitary hunting
vs group hunting needs to be clarified and put in a clearer context - it seems to be setting up a
study question that incorporates these factors into understanding distress call responses.
Alternatively, the actual study is only looking at the first scenario (solitary foraging insectivore)
to see if context of the distress call matters.
Line 126 (or around there): Can you comment on the similarity of these distress calls to other
social calls of this species? I'm wondering if this species produces territorial foraging calls, and if
so, if such territorial signals are similar enough in structure to distress calls that your playbacks
on the foraging grounds could have been mistaken for a territorial call, thus actively repelling
conspecifics.
Lines 146-147: What do you mean by "during the same playback session"? Are you saying that
the three types of trials were always paired so that you had comparisons at the same time on the
same date? Was this critical for some reason? This is touched on a little later in the Methods
when you talk about the 1-2-3 vs 3-2-1 order of the trial types, but I am not clear on how much
time separated each of the playback trials and why it would be important to collect the data in
close succession like that. Certainly, that is a good thing to ensure that no major changes occur
across the sampling period, but your study design suggests that maybe there is some other
reason that you wanted to have the three trials set up at the same time and date like this? Maybe
not, just wondering,
Line 151: Why did you put the conspecific and heterospecific calls into the same playback period
rather than separating them into two separate playback types? In other words, you did “silence-
con/hetero-silence”. Why not have half the sequences be “silence-con-silence” and the other half
be “silence-hetero-silence” and simply randomize the order of these two playback types within a
trial?
Line 164: Why was the speaker placed on the ground versus raised up on a tripod, like a flying
bat? Are you assuming that distress calls are generally emitted from injured, downed bats?
Makes sense, but maybe state it explicitly if that is your reasoning.
Line 204: What about any analysis of the reaction to Molossus molossus calls? The results of
such a test are described in the Results, but not included in the Methods. I am curious how you
managed this since the conspecific and heterospecific calls were emitted in back-to-back 15 sec
broadcasts – are these bats so fast and maneuverable that you are confident they would be
attracted and/or lose interest in a broadcast so quickly that you could detect differences in this
short time period?

This manuscript addresses an open question in our understanding of how animals, specifically bats,
eact to distress calls of conspecifics: does the context in which the distress call is emitted impact the
esponse of other individuals? In this study, the authors assess if greater sac-winged bats,
Saccopteryx bilineata, respond differently to the distress call of a conspecific that is emitted within a
oost versus near a roost versus at a foraging site. The study is novel and provides insight into how
bats behaviorally respond to a conspecific’s distress call. My comments primarily focus on some
clarification within the text and more clearly delineating what was done to compare reactions to
conspecific versus heterospecific calls.
Lines 59-61: What have the majority of these past studies found? Is the problem that most past
tudies have found no impact of distress call playbacks on bat behavior? The wording in the
parenthesized section suggests that is the case. If so, that needs to be more clearly stated.
The majority of studies found an impact of distress calls on bat behavior (e.g. Fenton 1976, August et
al. 1985, Russ et al. 1998, Nagel 2006, Carter et al. 2015) and it was never our intention to deny this.
We merely wanted to point out that a change of the experimental setup in distress call studies (e.g.
broadcasting distress calls near the roost instead of at a foraging site) could trigger a different (i.e.
tronger and/or faster) reaction. We clarified this in the revision (Line 60).
Lines 61-66: This end part of the paragraph with insectivores vs frugivores and solitary hunting vs
group hunting needs to be clarified and put in a clearer context - it seems to be setting up a study
question that incorporates these factors into understanding distress call responses. Alternatively,

solitary foraging insectivore with perennial day-roost associations) into a broader context.
Specifically, we wanted to emphasize that the social context might influence the behaviour towards
distress calls of every bat species, e.g. solitary foraging bats might react differently than group
hunting bats when distress calls are broadcast at feeding sites. We clarified this in the revision (Lines
66-69).
calls of this species? I'm wondering if this species produces territorial foraging calls, and if so, if such
erritorial signals are similar enough in structure to distress calls that your playbacks on the foraging
grounds could have been mistaken for a territorial call, thus actively repelling conspecifics.
Saccopteryx bilineata does not produce territorial foraging calls, so we think it is highly unlikely that
our playbacks actively repelled conspecifics. That said, there is a superficial similarity between some
distress calls and the buzz syllables of male territorial songs (but distress calls are much longer and
noisier than buzz syllables). Moreover, territorial songs are exclusively produced by males roosting in
heir day-time territories. within the day roost and not in the foraging ground. Furthermore the
erritorial buzz syllables are always part of a long stereotypic song whereas the distress calls are
emitted singly or in series without a stereotypic song pattern. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that
ndividuals have mistaken the distress call stimuli for a territorial song.
Lines 146-147: What do you mean by "during the same playback session"? Are you saying that the
hree types of trials were always paired so that you had comparisons at the same time on the same
date? Was this critical for some reason? This is touched on a little later in the Methods when you
alk about the 1-2-3 vs 3-2-1 order of the trial types, but I am not clear on how much time separated
each of the playback trials and why it would be important to collect the data in close succession like
hat. Certainly, that is a good thing to ensure that no major changes occur across the sampling
period, but your study design suggests that maybe there is some other reason that you wanted to
have the three trials set up at the same time and date like this? Maybe not, just wondering,
Yes, all three different trials (within the roost, in proximity to the roost and at the foraging ground)
were always paired, i.e. presented in direct succession to one another at dawn or dusk. The time
between the playback trials varied slightly between each session. In general, all three trials were
completed within one hour. The time between ‘in the roost’ and ‘in proximity to the roost’ depended
on the natural activity pattern of each bat colony (i.e. in the morning: the moment when bats start
o return to the roost and the moment when all bats were back in the colony/ in the evening: the
onset of activity in the roost and the moment when bats started to leave the roost), but was never
ess than 10min. The time gap between ‘in proximity to the roost’ and ‘at the foraging ground’ was
also never less than 10min (andusually longer than that). We presented the three trials in a paired
design during the same session to each colony in order to avoid major changes within in the group of
bats we were testing , e.g. general activity, specific group composition, etc. We clarified this in the
evision (Lines 149-151).
Line 151: Why did you put the conspecific and heterospecific calls into the same playback period
ather than separating them into two separate playback types? In other words, you did “silence-
con/hetero-silence”. Why not have half the sequences be “silence-con-silence” and the other half be
“silence-hetero-silence” and simply randomize the order of these two playback types within a trial?
This seems to be a misunderstanding. Actually, we used exactly the design you are proposing. We
used “silence-con-silence” and “silence-hetero-silence” stimuli and presented them in a balanced
order (Line 151) in each situation (in the roost, in proximity to the roost and at the foraging ground).
We clarified this in the manuscript (Lines 151-153).
Line 164: Why was the speaker placed on the ground versus raised up on a tripod, like a flying
bat? Are you assuming that distress calls are generally emitted from injured, downed bats? Makes
ense, but maybe state it explicitly if that is your reasoning.
Line 204: What about any analysis of the reaction to Molossus molossus calls? The results of such a
est are described in the Results, but not included in the Methods. I am curious how you managed
his since the conspecific and heterospecific calls were emitted in back-to-back 15 sec broadcasts –
are these bats so fast and maneuverable that you are confident they would be attracted and/or lose
nterest in a broadcast so quickly that you could detect differences in this short time period?
As mentioned above, the stimuli were not broadcasted in the same file (instead as “silence-con-
ilence” and “silence-hetero-silence” ) and we could thus analyse the reactions towards Saccopteryx-
and Molossus-stimuli separately in the two different recording files. All the analyses described in the
Playback analysis’ section were used for both conspecific and heterospecific playback recordings
Lines 182-199).
