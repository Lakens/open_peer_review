The manuscript entitled “Original Plant Traceability of Dendrobium Species Using Multi-
Spectroscopy Fusion and Mathematical Model” mainly presented an approach for fast
identification of botanical origins of Dendrobium materials. Mid-infrared and NIR techniques
combined with three different chemometric methods were used. Although lots of work has been
done by the authors, the sections of results and discussion should be further improved. After
careful review, I recommended major revision based on following points:
(1) As stated by authors, MIR and UV-Vis spectra was used to authenticate the multi-origin
Fengdou crude materials in Ref. [29]. What’s the difference between these two articles? Just two
different techniques?
(2) Line 56, Page 6. The reason for accumulation number was wrong.
(3) Why did authors choose to use these three methods?
(4) The section of discussion was simple, and the advantages and disadvantages of these three
methods should be discussed.
(5) The sample number used for was limited. I wonder the reliability of the results.
(6) How about the results of cross-validation for these three methods?
(7) Grid search support vector machine should be replaced by support vector machine.
(8) Line 60, Page 7. The authors stated reflection and transmission mode of mid-infrared
spectroscopy were used in this experiments. However, the comparison for these two modes was
not presented.

The manuscript includes relevant information and applied techniques for the discrimination of
Dendrobium species. However, it is poorly written which makes it hard to follow and
comprehend. It is highly recommended to be revised and rewritten by a native speaker.
A discussion of the relevant bioactive components and their relation to the finding in the IR data
is required. How do the species relate to each other with relevance to the metabolites is also
important. In page 4 you mention that the species are quite different in their metabolites so how
can you apply this to your discrimination results? The interpretation in page 12 deals with
functional groups rather than prediction of actual metabolites.

Appendix A
Dear editor,
Thanks for your kind letter of “Original Plant Traceability of Dendrobium Species
Using Multi-Spectroscopy Fusion and Mathematical Model”. We have revised the
manuscript in accordance with the reviewers’ comments, and carefully proof-read the
manuscript to minimize errors. The changes we made in the manuscript have shown a
new manuscript.
Here below is our description on revision according to the reviewers’ comments.
Response to Reviewer 1
Question: (1) As stated by authors, MIR and UV-Vis spectra was used to authenticate
the multi-origin Fengdou crude materials in Ref. [29]. What’s the difference between
these two articles? Just two different techniques?
Answer: (1) Thanks for your kind suggestions. There were some differences between
two articles in Ref. [29] and our present study. The former focused on the
combination between chemical structure information and different chromophores
(C=C, C=O) and auxochromes (-OR, -OH), which cover near-infrared spectra range
from 10000 to 4000 cm-1 and ultraviolet-visible spectra from 600 to 200 nm. The
latter was concentrated on complementary NIR and MIR spectra from 10000 to 650
cm-1 which reflect more detailed structure information of chemical components within
these Dendrobium species. In addition, published study of Ref. [29] didn’t contain the
most popular species—D. officinale which was the main species in the herbal market.
What’s more, the fusion strategy with complementary NIR and MIR spectra hasn’t
been reported for authentication of the multi-origins Fengdou crude materials.
Question: (2) Line 56, Page 6. The reason for accumulation number was wrong.
Answer: (2) Thanks for your kind suggestions. It’s our wrong explanation to the
reason for accumulation scans and the wrong writing has been removed in our revised
manuscript. In addition, we have learnt that the accumulation scans were related to
signal-to-noise ratio which increase with accumulation time (Stuart B. Infrared
spectroscopy, Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. John Wiley &
Sons, Inc., 2005.).
Question: (3) Why did authors choose to use these three methods?
Answer: Thanks for your kind question for improving our scientific writing. The
reason of application of three models is that different datasets with suitable model
would generate good discrimination results. Therefore, three methods were
investigated find the most suitable classification methods. In order explaining the
reason, the advantages and disadvantages of these three methods have been discussed
in our revised manuscript.
Random forest depends on the best ntree and optimal split variables (mtry) based on
lowest out-of-band (OOB) error. In addition, re-constructed matrix comprised of
important variables in light of permutation accuracy importance would influence the
final discrimination result.
Support vector machine as a non-linear classification model mainly depends on
hyperplane and kernel function. Generally, the model has excellent generalization
ability when compared with other multivariate statistical approaches.
Partial least squares discrimination analysis is a variant of partial least squares
regression. Different from regression analysis which is used for modeling relationship
between dependent variables (Y) and independent variables (X), PLS-DA tries best to
find a relationship between variables matrix (X) and label dataset (Y) for prediction of
unknown samples. Compared with two methods mentioned above, the method has
many evaluation parameters for result discussion.
Finally, each chemometrics method has their respective advantages in terms of theory,
calculation time, evaluation method, etc. Therefore, three methods were investigated
for comparison of discrimination.
Question: (4) The section of discussion was simple, and the advantages and
disadvantages of these three methods should be discussed.
Answer: (2) Thanks for your kind suggestions. We have added a chapter of
“Comparison of discrimination performance in three models” in our revised
manuscript.
Comparison of discrimination performance in three models
Based on the results from three models and two fusions strategies above, low-level
fusion method was recommended as the optimal fusion method for the discrimination
analysis of 12 Dendrobium species. It was interpreted that the low-level fusion
strategy contains the most original information from different spectra which would
reflect the maximum difference among 12 species. As for mid-level fusion method,
accuracy rate of calibration set in RF and accuracy rate of validation set in PLS-DA
were less than 100%. C value of cross-validation in mid-level fusion was higher than
that of low-level in SVM. The poor performance of mid-level fusion could be
explained that the variable transform might lose some chemical variable information
although it has rapid calculation speed.
Because of the equal discrimination performance of three model with low-level fusion
strategy, the advantage of low-level fusion was discussed in the chapter rather than the
comparison of three models.
Question: (5) The sample number used for was limited. I wonder the reliability of the
results.
Answer: (5) Because 119 specimens from 12 species were obtained from nursery
garden of Orchidaceae plants in Wenshan University in Wenshan Prefecture, there
aren’t enough samples of each species to be collected for the purpose of resource
protection. Surely, we will collect enough samples to investigate whether this method
is valid on other data in the further study.
Question: (6) How about the results of cross-validation for these three methods?
Answer: It’s our negligence that we didn’t clearly interpret the conception of
cross-validation. In our present study, calibration set was used to replace
cross-validation while validation set was equal to the conception of prediction set.
Question: (7) Grid search support vector machine should be replaced by support
vector machine.
Answer: Thanks for your kind suggestions. Grid search support vector machine has
been replaced by support vector machine in our revised manuscript. However, grid
search was still used because of its advantages [1, 2].

Gentiana rigescens by high-performance liquid chromatography and infrared
spectroscopy. Anal. Lett. 51, 2173-2191.
[2] Wu Z, Zhao Y, Zhang J, Wang Y. 2017 Quality assessment of Gentiana rigescens

Molecules. 22, 1238.
Question: (8) Line 60, Page 7. The authors stated reflection and transmission mode of
mid-infrared spectroscopy were used in this experiments. However, the comparison
for these two modes was not presented.
Answer: It’s our negligence that we didn’t clearly show the comparison for these two
modes. In the chapter of “Interpretation of mid-infrared spectra”, we have made the
comparison between them: Due to the fact that score plots (Figure S2A and S2B)
didn’t show satisfying cluster performance using transmission FTIR spectra (Figure
S3) after pretreatment by SD and MSC, ATR-FTIR spectra (Figure 4) was
recommended for further fusion analysis with NIR spectra matrix. Even though the
first two PCs interpreted 36.34% original information which was more than that
ATR-FTIR spectra (29.25%). In addition, there were similar spectra characteristics
just in terms of spectra peaks between 4000 to 1000 cm-1, which has the ability to
reflect most of chemical information of these species. In addition, it approximately
spent 1 min to scan one sample using reflection mode while transmission mode spent
10 min at least because of the long-time grind with potassium bromide. In addition, it
approximately spent 1 min to scan one sample using reflection mode while
transmission mode spent 10 min at least because of the long-time grind with
potassium bromide.
Question: (9) Language should be further improved. Lots of grammatical mistakes,
such as Line 21-23, Page 6; Line 41-44, Page 7; Line 50-51, Page 7; Line 56-57, Page
7.
Answer: Thanks for your kind suggestions and chance to correct these grammatical
mistakes.
Line 21-23, Page 6:“Potassium bromide (KBr) was obtained from Tianjin Fengchuan
Fine Chemical Research Institute (Tianjin, China)”has been rewritten as “Potassium
bromide (KBr) powder was purchased from Tianjin Fengchuan Fine Chemical
Research Institute (Tianjin, China)”in our revised manuscript.
Line 41-44, Page 7: “In addition, there are also overlapping absorbance peaks and
noisy signal caused interference for further discrimination purpose.” has been
rewritten as “In addition, there are also overlapping absorbance peaks and noisy
signal which would lead to interference for further discrimination purpose.”
Line 50-51, Page 7: “Therefore, second derivative was used for increasing resolution
and amplifying the weak absorbance peak belong to chemical structure” has been
rewritten as “Therefore, second derivative was used for increasing resolution and
amplifying the weak absorbance peaks”
Line 56-57, Page 7: “Two preprocessing methods and data transform from spectra
were computed by SIMCA 14.1 software (Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden).” has been
rewritten as “Two preprocessing methods and data transform were computed by
SIMCA 14.1 software (Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden).”
In addition, other spell mistakes and grammatical mistakes were also corrected in our
revised manuscript such as the redundant spacing.
Response to Reviewer 1
Question: A discussion of the relevant bioactive components and their relation to the
finding in the IR data is required. How do the species relate to each other with
relevance to the metabolites is also important.
Answer: Thanks for your kind suggestions, we have added the relevant bioactive
component and their relation to the finding in the ATR-FTIR spectra in our revised
manuscript. For instance, “Amongst these spectral variables, the absorbance at
3350.70 cm-1 (O-H stretching vibration) combined with band range between 1200
and 1030 cm-1 is responsible for the dominant polysaccharide in these crude materials
form Dendrobium plants [5,47]. Absorbance peaks between 900 and 650 cm-1 was
the fingerprint range of polysaccharide which is main active components within these
herbs [7]. Herein, Dendrobium polysaccharides was mainly contributed to these
bioactivities, such as anti-tumor, anti-diabetic, immuno-modulatory, and antioxidant
properties.”
Question: In page 4 you mention that the species are quite different in their
metabolites so how can you apply this to your discrimination results?
Answer: Thanks for your kind suggestions. It is the fact that these species are quite
different in their metabolites. Compared with common chemistry analysis methods,
spectroscopy mainly reflects chemical structure information of most of metabolites,
such as symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching vibration belonging to -CH3 and
-CH2-, O-H stretching vibration, etc. However, single spectroscopy has their
respective advantages with parts of metabolites information. Therefore, fusion spectra
in our present study including near-infrared and mid-infrared spectra were
investigated for discrimination results with more comprehensive chemical information
in which not only chemical structure information but their overtones and
combinations of fundamental vibrations absorbance hydrogen.
Question: The interpretation in page 12 deals with functional groups rather than
prediction of actual metabolites.
Answer: Thanks for your kind suggestions. It is the fact that the interpretation of
spectra deals with functional groups instead of prediction of actual metabolites.
Because of scientific fingerprint has fuzzy train not only in chromatograms but in
spectra (Layloff T. Scientific fingerprinting: a pharmaceutical regulatory tool.
Pharmaceutical Technology, 1991.), it is difficult that the spectra peaks interpret
actual metabolites. Surely, we still feel great appreciated for your suggestions. In the
further study of Dendrobium species, we will try our best to interpret the detailed
metabolites in these spectra when we could obtain more chemical standards and have
more better analytical technique.
