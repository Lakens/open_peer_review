Behaviour of free ranging wild boar towards their dead fellows – potential implcations for the
transmission of African swine fever.
Probst and coll.
An interesting paper aimed in highlighting the behaviour of wild boar in respect to intra-species
scavenging. The paper is easy to read and understand. Data are clearly presented. Conclusion is
coherent with the field data.
I would suggest few amendments, see the following lines:
Cannibalism: usually cannibalism includes an active killing of individuals of the same species. It
is true that cannibalism is – sometimes- used in replacing intra-species scavenging. Make clear
that – in the paper – cannibalism means intra species scavenging.
Social units (pag. 4 Line 54, pag 5 etc). I feel you could not assess which social unit the individuals
belonged to. I feel that you could individuate only the size of the wild boar group composition
that approached the carcass. Maybe it is better to replace Social unit (or similar) with “Feeding
units” or something similar but I would avoid to use social unit.
Direct contact: It would be important that you define what do you mean with DIRECT
CONTACT. You offered several good examples in the text, but a clear definition of Direct contact
(also indirect) would benefit the paper. It could be easily presented in Mat&Met session.
Fig. 1 and text: it appears that wild boar poorly approached (without any direct contact) the
carcasses after the end of February. You should comment this finding even if a very small sample
size is available. However it is interesting since in site n. 2 carcass n. 2 has been directly contacted
many times whereas carcass n. 12 only few indirect times. The same happened for carcass n. 3
directly contacted in site 3 whereas carcasses 11, 13 and 14 had only indirect contacts. I just
compared the data before 1st March. 7 out of 8 carcasses were directly contacted (N. 8 only had
indirect contacts); after 1st March 0 out of 4 were direct contacted. This lead to P=0.0101 (fisher
exact test).
Pag 2
Line 18: it would be better to add some literature supporting the “3% prevalence” and also to add
that the virus spreads geographically. As it is written now, it seems that the virus did not spread
at all whereas it is still spreading – even if less than expected – to west.
Check literature n. 4, 5,10. Citations not completed (EFSA ed. …ecc.)
Line 59: add “total” to the hunting bag figures;
PAG 3
Line 4: kindly add the wild boar estimated population size (include also density wb/kmsq)
Line 34: kindly add: “When activated (or similar)” otherwise it seems that cameras shot photos
even if not activate by any movements.
PAG 4
Line 30 Check Red kite (during winter?).
Line 43: 671 pictures with wild boars. Kindly define the average n. of wild boar(s) observed. Since
this data is lacking it is difficult to follow the discussion (pag 6 lines 37-49).
3
Line 51: since you mentioned the average time, it would be important to add SD as you did for
other parameters.
PAG 5
line 3: here it is difficult to catch if all the wild boar photographed could be distinguished or only
the 89 wild boars mentioned have been individually distinguished. You had 671 pictures of wild
boars, from the pictures you could identify ONLY 89 wild boars…or…from the pictures you
identified 89 different individuals? Could some individual be shot twice and identified as 2
different individuals (i.e. 2 times the same adult boar).
It should be clearer, including the age classes you used (young male, young animals, young pigs:
all used in the text).
Pag 6
Lines 37-47. This is the very high value of the paper. I would suggest to better highlight this part.
Eventually comparing (inferring) what could happen to the whole population inhabiting the
hunting ground. 9000 ha, about 700 wild boars (my guess) of which potentially 56 had direct
contacts with 14 carcasses (pag 5 line 7) got the infection during 193 days. Be careful that here 65
animals are mentioned (Line 42) whereas 56 had direct contact. Mistyping? Or the average size of
the feeding groups was only 1.16? Kindly check.
The total N. of days during which the carcasses were present (i.e. carcass n. 1 100 days, plus
carcass. 2 45 days etc etc. divided by 14; same data presented in Fig. 1: monitoring period) could
be linked with the 56 animals that - under an average time of carcass availability - had directly
contacted the carcasses. In this way you could estimate the local (under you wild boar density)
daily contact rate between wild boar and potentially contaminated carcasses. On average, a
carcass (that lasts on the ground X days) is directly contacted by a wild boar every X days. This
would greatly improve modelling and ASF management in the field.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This subject is highly relevant, particularly given the current ASF situation, but the findings are
not really novel and are based on rather limited fieldwork. I hope my comments help to improve
4
this manuscript, or even better convince the authors of the need of investing more efforts in the
field and regarding the existing literature.
Major comments
1.- Lack of novelty. Wild boar visits to wild boar carcasses, as well as wild boar avoidance of
carcasses of conspecifics, have already been recorded in similar habitats (temperate woodlands)
in neighboring Poland (Selva el al. 2005). This and other references (see also point 5) make this
manuscript of a more local than global relevance, although I take it that the current ASF situation
has contributed to an increased concern. The use of ruminant carcasses along with wild boar ones
allows for confirming avoidance and is interesting, but needs a better method design (see point
2).
2.- Methods. Camera trapping is in fashion, and technology is evolving fast. Assessing carcass
consumption requires accurate data on time at carcass and on behavior. Such data would best be
obtained by short video footage, which most modern camera traps can do. You used up to four
different models, and a range of intervals-between-pictures from 1 to 10 seconds. I am sorry, but
this is a poor methods design for your purpose. You can describe your data in terms of frequency
of visits to the carrion, but not in terms of frequency of actual consumption or direct contact with
the carcass. With one picture taken every second or even more, I feel that some carrion feeding
events by wild boar on e.g. wild boar piglets might have been missed. Finally I am not convinced
of the validity of visual individual identification in wild boar. References and more explanations
of the criteria used are missing.
3.- Carcass selection. Mixed age, gender, species and carcass status (gutted, wounded,
complete…). This is OK since you need to take what you get, but possibly the sample size is too
limited to make strong conclusions. If you decide using ruminant carcasses along with wild boar
ones, I suggest you do it always, or at least you increase the sample size and try homogenize
carcass characteristics as much as possible. There are too many individual peculiarities in this
design.
4.- Study sites and feeding. This said, I agree with the authors that the data suggest that “under
favorable feed conditions, cannibalism among wild boar is not a frequent phenomenon”.
However, one key information is missing: how much feed (winter feeding + baiting) is provided
in the study sites, and of what kind? The authors state that breeding occurs almost year-round,
and this suggests that plenty of food is available in all seasons – probably in part of
anthropogenic origin. This is of importance since well-fed wild boar are probably less interested
in cannibalism, than hungry ones.
5.- Carrion users. Deer species are known to prey on bird nests and have been recorded
consuming carrion. Certainly rodents do occasionally take up animal matter. Hence, even if the
focus of the paper is ASF, a suid-only infection, I strongly suggest not excluding any visiting
species.
6.- References. Some parts of the manuscript lack references. One example is the las paragraph
prior to the conclusions, but there are others, particularly regarding the methods for population
assessment and for recording animal presence or activity in some situations.
In addition, much of the literature on scavenging is not considered, neither in the introduction
nor in the discussion. This might be due to using pubmed or other “medical” search engines,
instead of general ones. Some references the authors might be interested in reading are the
following:
Selva et al. 2005 Factors affecting carcass use by a guild of scavengers in European temperate
woodland. Canadian Journal of Zoology Volume 83, Issue 12, December 2005, Pages 1590-1601
Mateo-Tomas et al. 2015 From regional to global patterns in vertebrate scavenger communities
subsidized by big game hunting. Diversity and Distributions Volume 21, Issue 8, 1 August 2015,
Pages 913-924
Another area to review is the literature on Trichinella in wild boar, since references on
scavenging or cannibalism might be relevant.

Behaviour of free ranging wild boar towards their dead fellows – potential implications for the
transmission of African swine fever
Probst et al.
The authors present a field experiment using camera traps to investigate the behaviour of free-
ranging wild boar towards their dead conspecifics in the light of ASF spreading westwards from
Eastern Europe. The presented study is novel and highly topical, contributing to the burning
questions for the role of carcasses for the transmission of ASF in wild boar.
The manuscript is written concise and comprehensible. The methods are mainly sound, but
exhibit some weaknesses (see comment on P8&9, Cameras). The results are presented clearly and
the conclusions are based on the results.
Previous comments of Reviewers 1 and 2 were thoroughly addressed by the authors. I mainly
agree with Reviewer 1 and see the manuscript as appropriate for publication after minor revision.
See the detailed comments below. I disagree with Reviewer 2, who questions the novelty of the
study (Comment 1). The presented findings are novel and highly relevant with respect to ASF
control and modelling in support of contingency planning.
Background
P7-L58: I would appreciate a reference to Figure 1 here
P7-L59: “coniferous” seems to me a more appropriate term instead of “evergreen”, but this
should be decided by a native speaker.
P8-L7: Please indicate to which spatial unit(s) the hunting bag refers.
P8-L23: Duplicate “all”.
Methods
P8&9, Cameras: I agree with Reviewer 2 that the camera trapping is somewhat inconsistent. The
use of lots of different camera models and the wide range of shot frequencies (every 1 to 10
seconds, technical constraint due to different cameras?) may have had an impact on the results.
This does not affect the principal findings of the study, but I would appreciate a table showing
“primary” and “confirmatory” camera models and shot frequencies per site (and season if
necessary).
P9-L33: Please also indicate in the methods at which time of day a camera day starts, and how
day and night were defined.
P9-L49: Please use the terms “primary” and “confirmatory”, introduced here, consistently
throughout the manuscript. E.g. in Table 2 you write “original” instead of “primary”.
Results
P10-L10: Shouldn’t it be 366 days, as 2016 was a leap year? Or even 367, of start and end dates are
inclusive?
P10-L13: In my understanding, “camera-days” are the total days “all cameras were in use”, not
“each camera was in use”, otherwise 1136 days in 366 days would not be possible.
P10-L17: Would it be possible to plot visits (without and with contact) at particular carcasses in
Figure 2? Like two different kinds of markers in the carcasses’ bars for each night with visits?
Given the finding that on average one and two weeks passed between deposition and visits and
contacts respectively, I would appreciate to see the temporal distribution of contacts. An
alternative visualization could be similar to a CDF, where the x axis shows time after deposition,
and the y axis shows the percentage of carcasses that had at least one contact/visit before x. This
could be done separately for summer and winter. The manuscript could in my eyes benefit from
more visual presentation of the results, and the delay of contact is an important finding that
supports the authors’ proposal of carcass removal.
P11-L9: See comment on P9-L33
P11-L9-16: Results based on the numbers and percentages of pictures are hard to assess in
relation, due to the experimental design. It may be helpful to also list frequencies per night (like:
…visits in xx% of camera nights in winter… or …0.1 visits per camera night…)
P11-L35-42: See comment on P10-L17.
Discussion
10
P13-L28: “they never stayed close to a carcass only for a short time” seems to be a mistake.
In my opinion, removal of carcasses may be unfeasible, although the observed delay of contacts is
promising. It deserves mention that the possible efficiency of carcass removal is completely
unclear and needs to be investigated.
Figure 2: Please improve x axis division/labels, e.g. with ticks at every month’s 1st and 15th, or
every 7 or 14 days.

Behaviour of free ranging wild boar towards their dead fellows – potential implications for the
transmission of African swine fever
Probst et al.
The authors present a field experiment using camera traps to investigate the behaviour of free-
ranging wild boar towards their dead conspecifics in the light of ASF spreading westwards from
Eastern Europe. The presented study is novel and highly topical, contributing to the burning
questions for the role of carcasses for the transmission of ASF in wild boar.
The manuscript is written concise and comprehensible. The methods are mainly sound, but
exhibit some weaknesses (see comment on P8&9, Cameras). The results are presented clearly and
the conclusions are based on the results.
Previous comments of Reviewers 1 and 2 were thoroughly addressed by the authors. I mainly
agree with Reviewer 1 and see the manuscript as appropriate for publication after minor revision.
See the detailed comments below. I disagree with Reviewer 2, who questions the novelty of the
study (Comment 1). The presented findings are novel and highly relevant with respect to ASF
control and modelling in support of contingency planning.
Background
P7-L58: I would appreciate a reference to Figure 1 here
P7-L59: “coniferous” seems to me a more appropriate term instead of “evergreen”, but this
should be decided by a native speaker.
P8-L7: Please indicate to which spatial unit(s) the hunting bag refers.
P8-L23: Duplicate “all”.
Methods
P8&9, Cameras: I agree with Reviewer 2 that the camera trapping is somewhat inconsistent. The
use of lots of different camera models and the wide range of shot frequencies (every 1 to 10
13
seconds, technical constraint due to different cameras?) may have had an impact on the results.
This does not affect the principal findings of the study, but I would appreciate a table showing
“primary” and “confirmatory” camera models and shot frequencies per site (and season if
necessary).
P9-L33: Please also indicate in the methods at which time of day a camera day starts, and how
day and night were defined.
P9-L49: Please use the terms “primary” and “confirmatory”, introduced here, consistently
throughout the manuscript. E.g. in Table 2 you write “original” instead of “primary”.
Results
P10-L10: Shouldn’t it be 366 days, as 2016 was a leap year? Or even 367, of start and end dates are
inclusive?
P10-L13: In my understanding, “camera-days” are the total days “all cameras were in use”, not
“each camera was in use”, otherwise 1136 days in 366 days would not be possible.
P10-L17: Would it be possible to plot visits (without and with contact) at particular carcasses in
Figure 2? Like two different kinds of markers in the carcasses’ bars for each night with visits?
Given the finding that on average one and two weeks passed between deposition and visits and
contacts respectively, I would appreciate to see the temporal distribution of contacts. An
alternative visualization could be similar to a CDF, where the x axis shows time after deposition,
and the y axis shows the percentage of carcasses that had at least one contact/visit before x. This
could be done separately for summer and winter. The manuscript could in my eyes benefit from
more visual presentation of the results, and the delay of contact is an important finding that
supports the authors’ proposal of carcass removal.
P11-L9: See comment on P9-L33
P11-L9-16: Results based on the numbers and percentages of pictures are hard to assess in
relation, due to the experimental design. It may be helpful to also list frequencies per night (like:
…visits in xx% of camera nights in winter… or …0.1 visits per camera night…)
P11-L35-42: See comment on P10-L17.
Discussion
P13-L28: “they never stayed close to a carcass only for a short time” seems to be a mistake.
In my opinion, removal of carcasses may be unfeasible, although the observed delay of contacts is
promising. It deserves mention that the possible efficiency of carcass removal is completely
unclear and needs to be investigated.
Figure 2: Please improve x axis division/labels, e.g. with ticks at every month’s 1st and 15th, or
every 7 or 14 days.

Appendix A
Dear Reviewers,
hank you for your feedback regarding our study on the behavior of wild boar towards their dead
ellows. Your comments have certainly improved the quality of the manuscript.
We revised the manuscript completely and added the results of the second part of the study, which
covered the summer half-year. This increased the observed time period to one year and increased
he sample size from 14 to 32 monitored carcasses.
We took your comments in the following way into account:
Reviewer 1
Cannibalism: usually cannibalism includes an active killing of individuals of the same species. It is true
hat cannibalism is – sometimes- used in replacing intra-species scavenging. Make clear that – in the
paper – cannibalism means intra species scavenging.
n “Methods and Materials”, we added the following sentence: In the analysis, we considered
ouching with the snout the remains of a carcass as direct contact, and feeding on carrion of the same
pecies as intra-species scavenging.
Social units (pag. 4 Line 54, pag 5 etc). I feel you could not assess which social unit the individuals
belonged to. I feel that you could individuate only the size of the wild boar group composition that
approached the carcass. Maybe it is better to replace Social unit (or similar) with “Feeding units” or
omething similar but I would avoid to use social unit.
We agree. We now replaced the term “social unit” by “group”.
Direct contact: It would be important that you define what you mean with DIRECT CONTACT. You
offered several good examples in the text, but a clear definition of Direct contact (also indirect)
would benefit the paper.
n “Methods and Materials”, we added the following sentence: In the analysis, we considered
ouching with the snout the remains of a carcass as direct contact (…).
Fig. 1 and text: it appears that wild boar poorly approached (without any direct contact) the
carcasses after the end of February. You should comment this finding even if a very small sample size
s available. However it is interesting since in site n. 2 carcass n. 2 has been directly contacted many
imes whereas carcass n. 12 only few indirect times. The same happened for carcass n. 3 directly
contacted in site 3 whereas carcasses 11, 13 and 14 had only indirect contacts. I just compared the
data before 1st March. 7 out of 8 carcasses were directly contacted (N. 8 only had indirect contacts);
after 1st March 0 out of 4 were direct contacted. This lead to P=0.0101 (fisher exact test).
We added the following sentence in the Discussion:
Wild boar seemed to find carcasses of conspecifics more attractive in summer/ fall than in winter,
maybe due to increased nutritional requirements in the warm season, which may be related to the
apid growth of piglets and the fact that they are suckling milk at this time of the year. In winter, wild
boar were exclusively observed in the dark and not seen returning to the carcass within the same
night. In summer, they were seen day and night, and the same groups sometimes returned to the
carcass some hours after the previous visit. However, with few exceptions, they never stayed close to
a carcass only for a short time (less than three minutes), which might be a further indication that they
were not interested in scavenging on it. The low number of visits in March and April might be due to
he fact that females are busy with building farrowing nests at this time of the year.
Line 18: it would be better to add some literature supporting the “3% prevalence” and also to add
hat the virus spreads geographically. As it is written now, it seems that the virus did not spread at all
whereas it is still spreading – even if less than expected – to west.
To avoid confusing the reader with too much detail, we deleted the sentence referring to 3%
prevalence.
Check literature n. 4, 5,10. Citations not completed (EFSA ed. …ecc.)
We checked and corrected the reference.
Line 4: kindly add the wild boar estimated population size (include also density wb/kmsq)
We understand the reviewer’s intention, but felt unable to estimate the wild boar population in the
area as we had only hunting bag data. However, we calculated the number of hunted wild boar per
hectare and added these data in Material and Methods:
The hunting bags 1995-2005 and 2005-2015 were 1,547 and 2,598 wild boar, which corresponds to
0.17 and 0.29 wild boar per hectare, respectively.
Line 34: kindly add: “When activated (or similar)” otherwise it seems that cameras shot photos even
f not activate by any movements.
We rephrased the sentence as follows:
The cameras were set to take one photo every 1 to 10 sec if activated.
PAG 4 Line 30 Check Red kite (during winter?).
The red kite was observed in summer.
Line 43: 671 pictures with wild boars. Kindly define the average n. of wild boar(s) observed. Since this
data is lacking it is difficult to follow the discussion (pag 6 lines 37-49).
We added the following sentence in the Results section:
The animals approached the site solitary (adult or young pigs), as part of small groups, or as part of
arge routs with up to 17 animals (mainly sows with piglets). The average group size was 4.1
standard deviation 3.1) and ranged from 1 (site 1) to 4.5 (site 4).
Line 51: since you mentioned the average time, it would be important to add SD as you did for other
parameters.
We added the following sentence in the Results section:
The average time a group or a solitary animal spent at the site during each visit ranged from 0.5 (site
8) to 7.2 minutes (site 7) (average 5.5 min; standard deviation 6.4).
PAG 5
ine 3: here it is difficult to catch if all the wild boar photographed could be distinguished or only the
89 wild boars mentioned have been individually distinguished. You had 671 pictures of wild boars,
rom the pictures you could identify ONLY 89 wild boars…or…from the pictures you identified 89
different individuals? Could some individual be shot twice and identified as 2 different individuals
i.e. 2 times the same adult boar).
t should be clearer, including the age classes you used (young male, young animals, young pigs: all
used in the text).
As the reliability of the identification of both groups and individuals has been questioned, we deleted
he respective data from the manuscript.
Pag 6
Lines 37-47. This is the very high value of the paper. I would suggest to better highlight this part.
Eventually comparing (inferring) what could happen to the whole population inhabiting the hunting
ground. 9000 ha, about 700 wild boars (my guess) of which potentially 56 had direct contacts with 14
carcasses (pag 5 line 7) got the infection during 193 days. Be careful that here 65 animals are
mentioned (Line 42) whereas 56 had direct contact. Mistyping? Or the average size of the feeding
groups was only 1.16? Kindly check. The total N. of days during which the carcasses were present (i.e.
carcass n. 1 100 days, plus carcass. 2 45 days etc etc. divided by 14; same data presented in Fig. 1:
monitoring period) could be linked with the 56 animals that - under an average time of carcass
availability - had directly contacted the carcasses. In this way you could estimate the local (under you
wild boar density) daily contact rate between wild boar and potentially contaminated carcasses. On
average, a carcass (that lasts on the ground X days) is directly contacted by a wild boar every X days.
This would greatly improve modelling and ASF management in the field.
As the reliability of the identification of both groups and individuals has been questioned, we deleted
he respective data from the manuscript. Individual identification of visiting animals and social
groups are prerequisite for the type of analysis proposed by the reviewer, but unfortunately we have
no alternative to visual identification. However, the validity of this method has been questioned by
Reviewer 2.
Reviewer: 2
1.- Lack of novelty. Wild boar visits to wild boar carcasses, as well as wild boar avoidance of carcasses
of conspecifics, have already been recorded in similar habitats (temperate woodlands) in neighboring
Poland (Selva el al. 2005). This and other references (see also point 5) make this manuscript of a
more local than global relevance, although I take it that the current ASF situation has contributed to
an increased concern. The use of ruminant carcasses along with wild boar ones allows for confirming
avoidance and is interesting, but needs a better method design (see point 2).
With regard to the aspect of novelty, we would like to point out that the few studies that have been
carried out on scavenging, including Selva et al. 2005, did not focus on wild boar. As we were
nterested in the potential role of wild boar carcasses in the spread of African swine fever, we
ocused on wild boar in our study.
2.- Methods. Camera trapping is in fashion, and technology is evolving fast. Assessing carcass
consumption requires accurate data on time at carcass and on behavior. Such data would best be
obtained by short video footage, which most modern camera traps can do. You used up to four
different models, and a range of intervals-between-pictures from 1 to 10 seconds. I am sorry, but this
s a poor methods design for your purpose. You can describe your data in terms of frequency of visits
o the carrion, but not in terms of frequency of actual consumption or direct contact with the
carcass. With one picture taken every second or even more, I feel that some carrion feeding events
by wild boar on e.g. wild boar piglets might have been missed. Finally I am not convinced of the
validity of visual individual identification in wild boar. References and more explanations of the
criteria used are missing.
We agree that short video sequences might seem to be the best method to document the behavior
of wild boar towards their dead fellows. We therefore started with video sequences, but found out
quickly that during the night (and this is the predominant time when wild boar are active) video
ootage is more difficult to interpret than individual photographs, even if the intervals-between
pictures are several seconds. To document the presence and behavior of wild boar as accurately as
possible, we used several cameras on one study site during the summer part of the study. We added
hese aspects to the “Material and Methods” section and also mention them in the “Discussion”
now.
The data on individual identification in wild boar were deleted from the manuscript to take the
concerns regarding visual identification into account.
3.- Carcass selection. Mixed age, gender, species and carcass status (gutted, wounded, complete…).
This is OK since you need to take what you get, but possibly the sample size is too limited to make
trong conclusions. If you decide using ruminant carcasses along with wild boar ones, I suggest you
do it always, or at least you increase the sample size and try homogenize carcass characteristics as
much as possible. There are too many individual peculiarities in this design.
We added the following sentence in the Discussion:
For reasons of practicability, we had to use carcasses with many different individual characteristics
e.g. gutted, wounded, complete). On the other hand, by using both male and female and different
age groups, we could rule out that cannibalism is avoided only under special circumstances (e.g. due
o the odor of adult males or piglets, or hunted animals). On the contrary, age, gender and the smell
of the carcasses seemed to have no influence on the behaviour, since all carcasses, including those of
adult males, were approached.
4.- Study sites and feeding. This said, I agree with the authors that the data suggest that “under
avorable feed conditions, cannibalism among wild boar is not a frequent phenomenon”. However,
one key information is missing: how much feed (winter feeding + baiting) is provided in the study
ites, and of what kind? The authors state that breeding occurs almost year-round, and this suggests
hat plenty of food is available in all seasons – probably in part of anthropogenic origin. This is of
mportance since well-fed wild boar are probably less interested in cannibalism, than hungry ones.
We added the following sentence in the “Materials” (study sites):
Although winter feeding is regularly provided in the surrounding area, no additional feeding was
provided in the vicinity of the study sites, with the exception of site 9, where 500 grams of maize per
day was provided through an automatic dispenser approx. 10 meters apart from the carcass site in
uly and August 2016.
To address the question of food availability, we added the following sentence in the Discussion:
The finding that intra-species scavenging among wild boar played hardly any role under the given
circumstances is not surprising as the study was carried out in an area where plenty of food is
available during all seasons (large forage areas with beechnuts, acorns, and other tree seeds as well
as agricultural products like cereals, fruits, and vegetables) and during a mild winter. Well-fed wild
boar are probably less interested in scavenging on decomposing carcasses of conspecifics. However,
he feed-rich situation is very similar across the whole country, so we can assume that the behaviour
of wild boar towards their dead conspecifics would be more or less similar in most parts of Germany
and central Europe. The potential impact of rough climatic conditions and scarcity of food has to be
addressed in other study areas.
5.- Carrion users. Deer species are known to prey on bird nests and have been recorded consuming
carrion. Certainly rodents do occasionally take up animal matter. Hence, even if the focus of the
paper is ASF, a suid-only infection, I strongly suggest not excluding any visiting species.
n this manuscript, we would like to focus on wild boar. We plan to publish the composition of the
cavenging fauna and other visiting species like deer or rodents separately.
6.- References. Some parts of the manuscript lack references. One example is the las paragraph prior
o the conclusions, but there are others, particularly regarding the methods for population
assessment and for recording animal presence or activity in some situations.
n addition, much of the literature on scavenging is not considered, neither in the introduction nor in
he discussion. This might be due to using pubmed or other “medical” search engines, instead of
general ones. Some references the authors might be interested in reading are the following:
Selva et al. 2005 Factors affecting carcass use by a guild of scavengers in European temperate
woodland. Canadian Journal of Zoology Volume 83, Issue 12, December 2005, Pages 1590-1601
Mateo-Tomas et al. 2015 From regional to global patterns in vertebrate scavenger communities
ubsidized by big game hunting. Diversity and Distributions Volume 21, Issue 8, 1 August 2015, Pages
913-924 Another area to review is the literature on Trichinella in wild boar, since references on
cavenging or cannibalism might be relevant.
The references are added to the literature.
Appendix B
Reviewer 3
We would like to thank the reviewer for the constructive feedback regarding our manuscript, which
helped to improve the quality of the manuscript. We are especially grateful for the judgement that
he results are highly relevant with respect to ASF control.. We took the comments in the following
way into account:
Background
P7-L58: I would appreciate a reference to Figure 1 here
We included a reference to Figure 1: “The landscape is dominated by agriculture, forestry and low
number of human settlements (Figure 1).”
P7-L59: “coniferous” seems to me a more appropriate term instead of “evergreen”.
We replaced “evergreen” by “coniferous”: “The study was conducted in nine different sites in five
ndependent, mixed coniferous/ deciduous forests dominated by oak (Quercus robur), alder (Alnus
glutinosa) and beech (Fagus sylvatica).”
P8-L7: Please indicate to which spatial unit(s) the hunting bag refers.
We added “9,000 hectares” in the sentence as follows: “Within the ground of 9,000 hectares, the
hunting bags 1995-2005 and 2005-2015 were 1,547 and 2,598 wild boar, which corresponds to 0.17
and 0.29 wild boar per hectare, respectively.”
P8-L23: Duplicate “all”.
We deleted the second “all”.
Methods
P8&9, Cameras: The use of lots of different camera models and the wide range of shot
requencies (every 1 to 10 seconds, technical constraint due to different cameras?) may have
had an impact on the results. This does not affect the principal findings of the study, but I
would appreciate a table showing “primary” and “confirmatory” camera models and shot
requencies per site (and season if necessary).
Table 2 with “technical specifications of the digital cameras used in the study” was included:

P9-L33: Please also indicate in the methods at which time of day a camera day starts, and how
day and night were defined.
We rephrased the sentence as follows: “The cameras were on standby mode during 24 hours a day
and set to take one photo every 1 to 10 s if activated.”
We did not differentiate between day and night.
P9-L49: Please use the terms “primary” and “confirmatory”, introduced here, consistently
hroughout the manuscript. E.g. in Table 2 you write “original” instead of “primary”.
n Table 2, we replaced the word “original” by “primary”.
Results
P10-L10: Shouldn’t it be 366 days, as 2016 was a leap year? Or even 367, of start and end dates
are inclusive?
The latter is correct. We therefore replaced 365 by 367 as follows: “The trial encompassed a total
of 367 days and nights starting from 27th October 2015 until 27th October 2016.”
P10-L13: In my understanding, “camera-days” are the total days “all cameras were in use”, not
“each camera was in use”, otherwise 1136 days in 366 days would not be possible.
We rephrased the sentence as follows: “The total sampling effort was 1,136 camera-days (number
of days all cameras were in use) yielding a total of 122,160 pictures, thereof 21,567 in winter and
110,593 in summer.”
P10-L17: Would it be possible to plot visits (without and with contact) at particular carcasses in
Figure 2? Like two different kinds of markers in the carcasses’ bars for each night with visits?
Given the finding that on average one and two weeks passed between deposition and visits and
contacts respectively, I would appreciate to see the temporal distribution of contacts. An
alternative visualization could be similar to a CDF, where the x axis shows time after
deposition, and the y axis shows the percentage of carcasses that had at least one contact/visit
before x. This could be done separately for summer and winter. The manuscript could in my
eyes benefit from more visual presentation of the results, and the delay of contact is an
mportant finding that supports the authors’ proposal of carcass removal.
Plotting all visits on Figure 2 resulted in a confusing diagram. Therefore, we divided Figure 2 into
wo new figures and distinguished between sites where only one carcass was placed (new Figure 2A)
and sites where several carcasses were placed (Figure 2B).
Figure 2: Timeline of monitoring wild boar carcasses. Each bar represents one carcass; the length of
he bar indicates how long it took until skeletonization of the carcass was complete. Bars in dark
blue=adult male; light blue=young male; dark pink=adult female; light pink=piglets. Days/nights with
wild boar visits are plotted with red (direct contact) and black (no direct contact) lines.
Figure 2A: Monitoring individual carcasses in winter (sites 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8).
Figure 2B: Consecutive monitoring of wild boar carcasses in winter and summer (sites 2 and 3) and in
summer (site 9).
We explained the new figures 2 and 3 in the “Methods section/study sites” as follows:
On sites 1, 6, 7 and 8, we placed one carcass and on sites 4 and 5 two piglets at the same time
Figure 2A). Sites 2, 3 and 9 were consecutively used to place several carcasses there; new
carcasses were only exposed after the skeletonization of the previous carcass was complete (Figure
2B). Sites 2, 3 and 9 were continuously monitored starting with the exposure of the first carcass until
he end of the study on 27th October 2016. On site 2, we placed a total of eight carcasses; on site 3,
nine, and on site 9 seven carcasses (thereof two piglets at the same time).”
P11-L9: See comment on P9-L33
Since we did not differentiate between day and night, we rephrased the sentence as follows: “A
otal of 520 wild boar visits were recorded in 298 days/nights (26 % of all 1,136 camera-nights),
hereof 63 visits (12 %) in 55 nights in winter and 457 visits (88 %) in 243 days/nights in summer
Table 3).”
P11-L9-16: Results based on the numbers and percentages of pictures are hard to assess in
elation, due to the experimental design. It may be helpful to also list frequencies per night
like: …visits in xx% of camera nights in winter… or …0.1 visits per camera night…)
We added the following sentence: “In most days/nights (191; 64 %), only one visit was observed. In
107 days/nights (36 %), two or more visits were observed: in 59 days/nights two visits, in 37
days/nights three, in 8 days/nights five, in 2 days/nights six, and in one days/nights nine.”
P11-L35-42: See comment on P10-L17.
We added the following sentence: “Direct contact was observed at 19 carcasses (Figure 2). Contact
n a fresh stage of decomposition was observed only in case of carcass 2 (day 1). Contact in the bloat
stage (inflation of the abdomen) was observed at carcasses 26, 32 (day 2) and 27/28 (day 3). All other
carcasses were only touched in a more advanced stage of decay. In six cases (carcasses 17, 20, 22,
23, 24, 29), contact took place after skeletonization was already completed (Figure 2).”
Discussion
P13-L28: “they never stayed close to a carcass only for a short time” seems to be a mistake.
We rephrased the sentence as follows: “However, with few exceptions, they only stayed at the
carcass site for a short time (less than three minutes), which might be a further indication that they
were not interested in scavenging on the carcass.”
n my opinion, removal of carcasses may be unfeasible, although the observed delay of contacts
s promising. It deserves mention that the possible efficiency of carcass removal is completely
unclear and needs to be investigated.
We rephrased the paragraph as follows: “The possible efficiency of carcass removal still needs to be
nvestigated. In any case, our results indicate that ASF transmission does not necessarily occur within
he first days after the death of an infected wild boar, if mediated through contact with an infected
carcass, but rather in a more advanced state of decomposition. However, infection of a single
animal may lead to the spread of ASFV to other members of the social group. Therefore, all efforts
hould be taken to localize and remove them as soon as possible, although wild boar carcasses are
not easy to find. If removal is not feasible, the carcass should be treated with strong repellents to
prevent wild boar approaching the site.”
Figure 2: Please improve x axis division/labels, e.g. with ticks at every month’s 1st and 15th, or
every 7 or 14 days.
The x axis of tables 2 and 3 are now divided into 14 days intervals.
Table 2, column “Percentage pictures with contact original camera”, row 3: 103%?
The error has been corrected; 103 % has been replaced by 18 %.
