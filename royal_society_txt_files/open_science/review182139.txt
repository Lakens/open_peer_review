Ciera and coworkers present an interesting paper on the efficacy of repellent-treated fabrics.
Unfortunately, the authors don't seem familiar with the current literature and make many
unsubstantiated claims in the introduction and discussion. Some mayor revisions would be
required before this paper could be published.
Introduction:
Page 2, Line 13: permethrin is a pyrethroid class insecticide with repellent properties. It is
different from the other repellents that can be sprayed on peoples skins.
Line 14-16 The citations used to show that 'synthetic repellents' are toxic to humans are not valid.
There is little in the literature to suggest that for example DEET is more toxic to humans like for
example PMD. The authors should take a critical look at the literature and rewrite their
introduction.
Line 19-20 Better say that there is a large market for 'alternative repellents'.
Line 6-42 Many of the citations in the introduction (like for example Science Daily) are not
acceptable and need to be replaced with scientific paper citations.
Materials - should be Materials & Methods
Page 5 Line 27 - please describe the species of mosquitoes used.
Line 51 the bioassay is not well described. Please add a scheme and photo so the reader can
understand how this assay works.
Page 6 Line 6 - Provide details of the solution from Mukabana and add citation.
Discussion:
Many of the citations are simply missing
Page 16 line 48 the authors contrast synthetic repellents with biological repellents. This is
unacceptable language.
Line 52 none of the repellents tested here are novel.
Line 53 Permethrin-treated clothing is already on the market.
Page 17 Line 10 Is there any proof that the textiles actually slowly release the repellents? If not
these claims must be removed.

The manuscript reports a preparation of mosquito repelling nanofibrous fabric by electrospinning
repellents-containing polymer solution. It is interesting and of practically useful of the
functionalized material by a facile technique. During the revision, most of the comments are well
replied. However, this reviewer would suggest a minor revision with several additional
questions:
1) Since the used mosquito repellents are volatile that will be easily evaporated during
electrospinning, so is it possible to verify the exact amount of repellents remaining in the
nanofiber after electrospinning?
2) PAV is a water-soluble polymer, as claimed by the authors it is environmental; however, just
because it is water-soluble it would be easily dissolved for the resulting PVA nanofibers since
applying environment is moist/wet/high humidity, and for human skin, it also might be
sweating. So, how to address this issue?
3) SEM image of nanofiber containing different amount of repellents should be provided.
4) The size of the microcapsules is 5 ±1 µm, how does such a big size particles being
encapsulated in nanofibers with the diameter of about several hundreds nanometers?
5) In the experiment section, it is written that the PVA solution was prepared under stirring at
room temperature (21 ±1°C), but as I know the PVA could usually be dissolved under heating
(~90°C). Can you answer this question?
6) What is the thickness of the nanofiber mat used for the mechanical test (both the directly
measured and calculated ones)?

mentioned it as an example of a synthetic repellent. Please see the paragraph below:
The most effective and most commonly used insect repellents for preventing mosquito bites
present on the market today are synthetic in nature which include DEET (N, N-diethyl-3-
methylbenzamide), permethrin and Picaridin [2, 4, 5]. However, some of these synthetic
repellents are associated with some harmful and toxic effects, some resulting in allergic
reactions and damage to the nervous system [6, 7]. Moreover, some mosquitoes have become
resistant to the current synthetic repellents and environmental concerns have prevented their
effective use [3, 5]

For the same concentrations, Permethrin performs better (89% reduction) in repelling
mosquitos than the other repellents like chili (51% reduction), PMD (74% reduction) and catnip
oil (50% reduction), [2, 39]. Moreover, a potent repellent effect was observed in permethrin as
is reported in previous studies [2, 40, 41].

These results clearly indicate that the novel textile materials with incorporated biological
repellents can be used in the protection against mosquitoes. Recently, biological repellents are
considered as a tool in vector control preventing mosquito house entry [32, 42, 43], providing a
promising application for our novel repelling textiles in push-pull system [44]. In light of these
potential applications, future studies should focus on the durability of the material, such as their
washing durability and the longevity of the repellency efficacy.

Lastly, microencapsulation prevents repellents from being in direct contact with the skin,
therefore reducing skin irritation and/or allergic reactions. An additional advantage of

For the pure permethrin spectra (Figure 5, b), four characteristic peaks at 3064, 1614, 1437 and

permethrin, the same characteristic peaks, namely 3064, 1614 and 1000 cm-1, were present like
in pure permethrin (not found in PVA) and therefore can be used for the identification of
permethrin in PVA nanofibrous structures. The spectra for the sample of PVA incorporated with
permethrin showed the peaks for both PVA and permethrin, namely at 1614 and 1000 cm-1 for
permethrin, and 1437 for PVA, confirming the presence of permethrine in the spun PVA
nanofibrous structure.

To conclude, mosquito repellents were successfully spun into PVA nanofibers with
electrospinning to obtain a possible slow release mosquito repellent textile. Two techniques
were used, namely electrospinning of microcapsules with incorporated repellent and direct
emulsion electrospinning of the repellents. These methods both proved very successful in
developing new and very effective mosquito repelling textile material that can be used in the
prevention against mosquito associated diseases. Whereas, incorporation of microcapsules in
the nanofibers gives long term functionality it still needs active breakage of the microcapsules to
release the functional additive. Here we only tested PMD, but it is obvious that these micro-
capsules can contain many different repellents and even mixtures, making this an attractive,
quick method for developing a variety of repelling textiles. On the other hand, emulsion
electrospining encapsulates the functional additives in a one-step process into nanofibers
making it a simple and cheap technique. Moreover, because the encapsulating wall is so thin, it
may be possible that the additives are continuously released slowly and it is therefore needless
to break the nano-capsules to release the additive. However, this possible continuous release
may result in short term use. Both methods show great potential in creating novel and very
efficient repelling textiles, not only on a lab-scale but also for industrial–scale productions.

would like to thank you for your email and your continuous effort to improve our paper. We have
and answered the comments of the reviewers in great detail.
eviewer 2 and 4 did not have any more questions/remarks we only could answer the remarks of
ewer 3 who had some valid points:
utline of the reviewers’ comments and our changes and/or rebuttal is described below. Our
onses to the reviewer’s comments appear in italic. Thank you for your continued assistance
ughout this process.
1) Since the used mosquito repellents are volatile that will be easily evaporated during
electrospinning, so is it possible to verify the exact amount of repellents remaining in the
nanofiber after electrospinning?
This is a valid point and some of the repellent will evaporate during the electrospinning
process, however we think this loss will be very minimal during the process for the
following reasons:
- The repellent is in emulsion in PVA and is oil like, therefore water from the PVA
solution will still be evaporated first and in greater amounts than the repellent, although
it is possible that some small quantities of the repellent could evaporate.
- We still see beads in the fibres compared to the blank meaning that the repellent
did get included in the PVA nanofibrils (Figure 2)
- We showed that the repellents are present in the fibrous mats with infrared
which is very clear (Figure 5)
- We can show a repellent effect on mosquitos of our fibrous mats which is a
macroscopic effect of a nanofibrous mat, meaning that the repellent that is integrated
into the electrospun mats must be significantly high (Figure 6)
So in general, we are convinced that the repellent is integrated in the electrospun mats
and in large quantities. In the future, we of course will quantify these amounts but it is
extremely hard to also show this. As for now there is no straight forward technique to do
this. So yes, this will be done in the future but is not part of the current paper.
2) PVA is a water-soluble polymer, as claimed by the authors it is environmental; however, just
because it is water-soluble it would be easily dissolved for the resulting PVA nanofibers since
applying environment is moist/wet/high humidity, and for human skin, it also might be
sweating. So, how to address this issue?
Again, a very valid point and it is strange that this question has not been raised before.
PVA is indeed water soluble and indeed in high humidity situations it is possible that the
structure would dissolve. However, there are already many techniques known in the
literature that show you can crosslink PVA to make it water insoluble (Affandi et al.,
2012). These techniques are quite standard and are known to work so we see no
problem on applying these to our fabrics to make them water insoluble.
Therefore a sentence was added in the manuscript in the discussion section:
“Also, as PVA is water-soluble, it will be important to look at possible crosslinking
methods to make the PVA in combination with the different repellents water-insoluble
and independent of environmental humidity.”
3) SEM image of nanofiber containing different amount of repellents should be provided.
For this paper and its focus we do not see the added value of adding additional SEM
image of nanofiber containing different amount of repellents. We think the given
pictures (Figure 2) are sufficient and clear, and additional pictures in the manuscript
would overload the paper with images and make it extra-long.
4) The size of the microcapsules is 5 ±1 µm, how does such a big size particles being encapsulated
in nanofibers with the diameter of about several hundred nanometers?
This is a strange question for someone in the field of electrospinning as this is quite
basic. In short, in the paper we mentioned that we are using a needle of 15 cm long
stainless steel needle with an inner diameter of 1.024 mm. This diameter of the needle is
not the ultimate diameter of the spun fibres as these are formed with the Taylor cone
and during evaporation. So we go from 1mm to hundreds of nanometers during the
spinning process. It is thus clear that the microcapsules can clearly pass the needle and
are expelled during the electrospinning process, forming an equal distribution in the mat
during the spinning of the PVA.
5) In the experiment section, it is written that the PVA solution was prepared under stirring at
room temperature (21 ±1°C), but as I know the PVA could usually be dissolved under heating
(~90°C). Can you answer this question?
It is true, both techniques work. Elevated temperatures will indeed dissolve the PVA
faster and then you can use it sooner too. We opted for dissolving it at room
temperature but for a much longer time in order to avoid heat damage to the PVA.
6) What is the thickness of the nanofiber mat used for the mechanical test (both the directly
measured and calculated ones)?
The thickness of the mats was not taken as it is extremely difficult to measure this
accurately. Instead we considered the width and the length of the sample (3 x 30 mm)
sample strips. Afterwards all samples were weighed having an average weight of 7,71±1
mg to ensure an equal thickness between samples. This leads to a much better
comparison between samples. (This is explained in the material and method section).”
