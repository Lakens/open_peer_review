Comments on Morita et al: River temperature drives salmon survivorship: is it determined prior
to ocean entry?
label_version_2
RSOS-140312
This paper shows a relationship between river temperature and fry-to-adult survival of chum
salmon. The authors show evidence that a survival bottleneck is established during the
freshwater migration, due to the observed relationship between returning adults and migrating
fry, and suggest this observed pattern in fry-to-adult survival is driven by river temperatures
during the fry migration.
There is increasing recognition that the brief freshwater life during the seaward migration of
salmon represents a survival bottleneck, and that this brief period would typically be "lumped in"
with ocean life, masking the observation that the bottleneck actually occurs prior to ocean entry.
This paper presents an example of this idea.
I was a reviewer for a previous version of this manuscript, submitted to Biology Letters.
Changes since previous version of manuscript:
I raised some major and some minor comments about the previous version. Those comments
appear to have been dealt with adequately, and the current version is much clearer now with a
greater mechanistic focus on temperature as a factor influencing survival, and without the
distraction of cherry tree phenology. Below, I raise a few further comments about the current
version.
Major comments:
The authors quantified and discussed various survival rates of salmon, but occasionally they
discuss these results and ideas interchangeably with population size (e.g. in summary at lines 30-
31 and 32; beginning of introduction; elsewhere). In their highly constrained case study of using
hatchery-reared salmon and releasing a constant number of fish each year, this may be acceptable
to use these interchangeably because variation in population size will be direcly influenced by
(and equivalent to) variation in survival rates. However, this is a rare exception in typical
ecological or fisheries contexts, and most readers will have a different understanding of what is
meant by and influences population size in more natural settings (i.e. when there is no artificial
constraint on initial population size each year). I suggest that the authors do not extrapolate their
findings about survival rates to imply these are also findings about population size, and just stick
to discussing survival rates.
[ This follows my comments on the previous version of the manuscript:
- In the special case of this study all years had the number of fry released, and thus the number of
fry observed days later and adults observed years later reflect survival differences. But this
should not be taken to mean that the number of observed fish should be equated to population
size; population size is determined by many factors not discussed in this paper.
- All previous discussion leading up to this involves survival, and there has not been an adequate
development of factors affecting population size in order to raise that here. ]
The authors show the effect of temperature on fry-to-adult survival (fig 3). Temperature could
affect survival while still within the river, or temperature experienced within the river could have
latent effects and affect later survival, after ocean entry. There is some indication that because fry-
to-smolt survival appears to be at least partly determined before ocean entry (fig 5), effects of
temperature occur early in life. However, the strength of relationship is surprisingly stronger in
fig. 3 than in fig. 5. The missing part of this puzzle is the effect of river temperature on the
number of observed fry. A second panel could be added to fig. 3, so that temperature effects on
survival are shown at the stage of migrating fry as well as at the stage of returning adults.
--If the relationship of temperature on fry-to-adult survival turns out to be stronger than the
relationship of temperature on observed number of migrating fry (i.e. in-river survival, given the
constant release number), that could mean at least two possibilities, which should warrant
3
considerable discussion. One possibility is that there is a latent (delayed) effect of river
temperature on survival, which occurs after ocean entry. In other words, river temperature may
affect survival within the river and may cause further effects, later, which happen to be
manifested after leaving the river. Another possibility is simply that the index of fry abundance is
less accurate than the counts of returning adults, so that even if temperature-induced mortality
occurs primarily within the river, the observation uncertainty at the fry stage is so great that this
observed relationship is weaker than the observed relationship after the full ocean life.
--If the relationship of temperature on fry-to-adult survival is instead weaker than the
relationship of temperature on observed number of migrating fry (which is hard to imagine,
given the r^2 of 0.91), that would tend to suggest the effect of river temperature on fry-to-adult
survival occurs entirely within the river, before ocean entry.
The authors discuss some management (hatchery) considerations in lines 132-140. Why would
hatchery managers choose to release fish during a period of low river temperature that is clearly
sub-optimal for survival? Are there other considerations involved in decisions of release timing?
Are there explicit efforts to avoid concurrent migration periods with the wild fish that typically
migrate a month later?
Minor comments:
- the abundance index of outmigrating fry was based on visual counts. Was variation in water
transparency accounted for? This could affect estimates of abundance and observed patterns in
survival, especially if visibility covaries with river temperature.
- are there examples from the literature of how river conditions may affect mortality during ocean
life of salmonids? Consideration of studies that have looked at 'lagged mortality', 'delayed
mortality', or 'latent mortatlity' (or similar search terms) may reveal some relevant papers.
- not necessary, but the authors may wish to discuss conservation or management implications of
climate change predictions and the associated effects of river temperatures on survival. Fig. 2
shows that annual temperatures varied, but the individual years are not labelled; was there any
consistent interannual trend in temperature? (I recognize there are only 8 years of data). Is chum
salmon survival, at least of hatchery fish, expected to improve in a warming climate?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The manuscript “River temperature drives salmon survivorship…” by Morita et al. illustrates a
relationship between river temperature and juvenile chum salmon survivorship to adulthood.
Although the trends demonstrated by Morita et al. are somewhat convincing and the findings
could be important for fisheries management applications, I consider the work in need of further
revisions before I would consider it acceptable for publication in Royal Society Open Science. To
be clear, the manuscript has improved from the past revision substantially and the material is
appropriate for the journal. However, the authors need to statistically assess to account for
potential complications in their story. My comments are divided into major and minor concerns
below.
Major concerns:
-The authors provide information pertaining to the date of release into the river for the juvenile
salmon, and this absolutely should be retained. However, as I feared in the first review, the
salmon were released over a 5-month period depending on the year and although the authors
imply that they were mostly released in a brief window (line 90) but provide no measures of
what proportion were released on the “average date”. This aspect of their study must be treated
with more caution for several reasons. The timing of their release could have to do with any
number of factors not related to temperature but that could rather be related to the timing of
release, including hydrologic factors, food resources, photoperiod, and many others. Simply
correlating the date of release with survivorship (line 91) does not adequately address the issue
because the timing of release could interact with temperature to affect survivorship, for example.
The authors should develop a more sophisticated statistical model that includes temperature but
also timing of release, hydrologic conditions if they have the data (such as mean flow for that
year), and other potentially pertinent data that they may have (for instance, invertebrate
resources) plus interaction terms. A mixed linear model would probably suffice, so long as the
assumptions are met. The overall story may not change: only temperature may prove to be a
statistically significant variable. But considering the range of dates in which salmon were
released, the authors must make sure that other factors are not affecting survivorship. Even if, in
an appropriate model, only temperature appears to be a statistically significant explanatory
variable for survival, this would strengthen their findings considerably.
-Although I did suggest the authors look into literature on salmon survivorship and temperatures
by pointing them to papers that concerned adults, I still stand by my assertion that the freshwater
life stage is well-studied in the literature. The authors should not imply that salmon biologists
have neglected the freshwater stage (lines 48-50). Here are a few papers that consider
survivorship and juvenile salmon with respect to temperature: Baker et al. CJFAS (1995), Burt et
al. Ecology of Freshwater Fish (2012), and Naiman et al. Ecosystems 2002. The literature that
covers how the freshwater stage impacts survival rates is much more extensive. The results
shown here are unique and worthy of publication, the authors just need to be careful to not imply
that this is an overlooked life stage.
Minor concerns:
-Line 51: change to “freshwater life history stage”.
-Line 91: if you are showing an r-squared value, this is a regression, not a correlation. In any case,
the statistics should be more comprehensive.
-Line 116: there may be more explanations that simply have not been considered. Reword this
sentence to clarify that these are the three strongest theories that the authors derived.

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-140312)
Thank you for your most constructive comments on our revised manuscript.
We concur with all of the suggestions made by the two reviewers and have revised the
manuscript accordingly. In addition, we have modified the equation to estimate survivorship and
calculate the number of returning adults for each sex separately (line 77). Responses to each
comment are detailed below.
Referee: 1
Major comments:
The authors quantified and discussed various survival rates of salmon, but occasionally they

- All previous discussion leading up to this involves survival, and there has not been an adequate
development of factors affecting population size in order to raise that here.].
Response: We have removed the words “population size” from the revised manuscript.
The authors show the effect of temperature on fry-to-adult survival (fig 3). Temperature could
affect survival while still within the river, or temperature experienced within the river could have
latent effects and affect later survival, after ocean entry. There is some indication that because fry-
to-smolt survival appears to be at least partly determined before ocean entry (fig 5), effects of
temperature occur early in life. However, the strength of relationship is surprisingly stronger in
fig. 3 than in fig. 5. The missing part of this puzzle is the effect of river temperature on the
number of observed fry. A second panel could be added to fig. 3, so that temperature effects on
survival are shown at the stage of migrating fry as well as at the stage of returning adults.
Response: We have added a second panel to Fig. 3 (Figure 3a), and have added the results of the
relationship between river temperature and the number of fry moving past the observation
windows (lines 102–104).
--If the relationship of temperature on fry-to-adult survival turns out to be stronger than the
relationship of temperature on observed number of migrating fry (i.e. in-river survival, given the
constant release number), that could mean at least two possibilities, which should warrant
considerable discussion. One possibility is that there is a latent (delayed) effect of river
temperature on survival, which occurs after ocean entry. In other words, river temperature may
affect survival within the river and may cause further effects, later, which happen to be
manifested after leaving the river. Another possibility is simply that the index of fry abundance is
less accurate than the counts of returning adults, so that even if temperature-induced mortality
occurs primarily within the river, the observation uncertainty at the fry stage is so great that this
observed relationship is weaker than the observed relationship after the full ocean life.

relationship of temperature on observed number of migrating fry (which is hard to imagine,
given the r^2 of 0.91), that would tend to suggest the effect of river temperature on fry-to-adult
survival occurs entirely within the river, before ocean entry.
Response: The relationship between temperature and fry-to-adult survival was stronger than the
relationship between temperature and the observed number of migrating fry. We have added
discussion on this point following your suggestions, i.e., delayed effect of river temperature after
passing the observation windows and/or inaccuracy of the fry abundance index (lines 138–145).
We have also added a photo of the weir to show accuracy of the returning adult counts (Figure
1a). One point that I missed in the previous manuscript was the location of the observation
windows. The observation windows were located 10 km downstream from the fry release site
and 70 km upstream from the river mouth. Therefore, the fry had to migrate an additional 70 km
within the river. Therefore, delayed mortality could occur within the river. We have added this
information to the revised manuscript (lines 143–147).

The authors discuss some management (hatchery) considerations in lines 132-140. Why would
hatchery managers choose to release fish during a period of low river temperature that is clearly
sub-optimal for survival? Are there other considerations involved in decisions of release timing?
Are there explicit efforts to avoid concurrent migration periods with the wild fish that typically
migrate a month later?
Response: Thank you for your comments. There is no management guide about river temperature
at the time of release in Japan. A management guide with sea surface temperatures at the time of
release has been established in Japan. Thus, most researchers and hatchery managers check the
coastal sea temperature. Therefore, this study is very important for management considerations.
The release time decision is simply subjected to hatchery capacity limitations. Well-fed fry
continue to grow in the hatchery, but hatchery ponds cannot maintain a large number of large fry
in good health. Therefore, it is difficult to delay or control the time of release. In addition,
agricultural use of Chitose River water begins in May, so hatchery managers want finish
releasing fish before May (to reduce the number of hatchery fry straying into rice fields). We have
added these points to consider the release time (lines 173–177). At present, there is no official
measure to protect wild fish in the Chitose River. See Morita (2014) (cited in this paragraph) for
details.
Minor comments:
- the abundance index of outmigrating fry was based on visual counts. Was variation in water
transparency accounted for? This could affect estimates of abundance and observed patterns in
survival, especially if visibility covaries with river temperature.
Response: No, it was not. The abundance index would include substantial uncertainty, as
discussed above. However, the Chitose River is a spring-fed river, water is usually clear, and
clarity is relatively stable. We have added this point to the Materials and methods (lines 89–90).
- are there examples from the literature of how river conditions may affect mortality during ocean
life of salmonids? Consideration of studies that have looked at 'lagged mortality', 'delayed
mortality', or 'latent mortatlity' (or similar search terms) may reveal some relevant papers.
Response: We have added citations to the Discussion on delayed mortality (lines 145–147).
- not necessary, but the authors may wish to discuss conservation or management implications of
climate change predictions and the associated effects of river temperatures on survival. Fig. 2
shows that annual temperatures varied, but the individual years are not labelled; was there any
consistent interannual trend in temperature? (I recognize there are only 8 years of data). Is chum
salmon survival, at least of hatchery fish, expected to improve in a warming climate?
Response: We have labelled the individual years in Figure 2. We have also added a paragraph in
the Discussion on the impact of climate warming on survival of hatchery-reared salmon (lines,
190–197).
Referee: 2
Major concerns:
-The authors provide information pertaining to the date of release into the river for the juvenile
salmon, and this absolutely should be retained. However, as I feared in the first review, the
salmon were released over a 5-month period depending on the year and although the authors
imply that they were mostly released in a brief window (line 90) but provide no measures of
what proportion were released on the “average date”. This aspect of their study must be treated
with more caution for several reasons. The timing of their release could have to do with any
8
number of factors not related to temperature but that could rather be related to the timing of
release, including hydrologic factors, food resources, photoperiod, and many others. Simply
correlating the date of release with survivorship (line 91) does not adequately address the issue
because the timing of release could interact with temperature to affect survivorship, for example.
The authors should develop a more sophisticated statistical model that includes temperature but

released, the authors must make sure that other factors are not affecting survivorship. Even if, in
an appropriate model, only temperature appears to be a statistically significant explanatory
variable for survival, this would strengthen their findings considerably.
Response:
We have added a new paragraph to the Results (lines, 114–123). We have added results when the
proportion of fry released during a given period was used as an explanatory variable (lines, 119–
121). Released fry survivorship was not significantly correlated with the proportion of fry
released during each 10-day period in both simple and partial correlations after controlling for
river temperature (mid-January to late-April, 11 periods, result not shown). We added raw data
(proportion of fry released during each month) in supplemental material. We have added river
discharge as an explanatory variable (lines, 92–95, 114–119). This includes the results of simple
correlation and multiple regression analyses, where explanatory variables are the date of release,
river discharge, and river temperature.
I acknowledge that the date of fry release is an important factor affecting the survival rate.
Different studies have examined the effect of release date on survivorship. Release date-specific
otolith markings within the same brood year were used during several years, and there were
significant relationships between release date and survivorship. However, this was not within the
scope of this study. The average date of fry release varied little (controlled) between years and
was not an important factor affecting survivorship of hatchery-reared chum salmon. We do not
want to argue that the fry release date is not important. We have added a citation on results of
releasing date-specific otolith marked fish to the Discussion (lines, 170–172).
-Although I did suggest the authors look into literature on salmon survivorship and temperatures
by pointing them to papers that concerned adults, I still stand by my assertion that the freshwater
life stage is well-studied in the literature. The authors should not imply that salmon biologists
have neglected the freshwater stage (lines 48-50). Here are a few papers that consider
survivorship and juvenile salmon with respect to temperature: Baker et al. CJFAS (1995), Burt et

covers how the freshwater stage impacts survival rates is much more extensive. The results
shown here are unique and worthy of publication, the authors just need to be careful to not imply
that this is an overlooked life stage.
Response: We have added a new sentence to the Introduction (lines, 51–53) to state that “several
studies suggested that riverine environmental conditions, such as temperature and discharge,
significantly affect freshwater mortality of salmonid fish prior to ocean entry (Bakers et al. 1995,
Jensen and Johnsen 1999)”.
Minor concerns:
-Line 51: change to “freshwater life history stage”.
Response: We have changed this to “freshwater life history stage” (line 55).
-Line 91: if you are showing an r-squared value, this is a regression, not a correlation. In any case,
the statistics should be more comprehensive.
9
Response: We have changed the r-squared to r values in the revised manuscript, except in Figure
4.
-Line 116: there may be more explanations that simply have not been considered. Reword this
sentence to clarify that these are the three strongest theories that the authors derived.
Response: We have changed this sentence to clarify that these are our three ideas (lines, 148–149).
We hope our responses are satisfactory.
