In this study, the exploration behaviour of the Rock Ant Temnothorax albipennis is studied.
Colonies are housed in nests of varying quality, and the number of exploration bouts, and their
total and individual lengths and durations, are measured. Two conclusions are drawn: Regarding
collective exploration, the authors conclude that overall exploration rates increase as current nest
value decreases. Regarding individual exploration, the authors conclude that exploration bout
length and duration increase with increasing nest quality, while instantaneous speed decreases.
The paper reads well, the motivation behind the experiments is sound, and the experimental
methodology is robust. The figures are clear and informative. The statistical analysis is, to my
knowledge, generally sound (see some minor comments at the end), although I cannot judge the
Python script. Indeed, I applaud the provision of both the preliminary data checking and the
scripts use to carry out the analysis (but see some minor comments) – this sort of transparency is
what most papers should strive for.
I find the collective results robust, reliable and believable. I will make more detailed suggestions
at the end, but have no major comments regarding this aspect of the work.
However, I am very sceptical about the patterns described for the individual level behaviour.
While significant differences are found, and I can find no flaw in how the statistics were carried
out (I am no expert on the matter). However, the effect size seems from the figures to be very
small indeed. If we consider the breadth of the whiskers in all panels of figure 4, we see that
variation within groups is much, much greater than variation between groups. If we were to
consider non-transformed data, the whiskers would likely be even broader. While there is no
agreed upon equivalent for an R-squared value for generalised linear mixed-effect models
(GLMM), a rough estimate can be achieved by using an equivalent GLM. Using the raw data
supplied, I calculated such R-squared. Log bout duration vs treatment had an adjusted R squared
of 0.78% - less than 1% of the variation is explained by the treatment! Similar results are found for
speed (2.21%). Very large sample sizes (here they vary from 2205 to 648 samples per treatment)
can result in even tiny effects reaching significance. Just because an effect is statistically
significant does not mean it is either real or that it has biological meaning.
Even if we were to agree that these patterns represent real and important biological effects (which
I do not), I do not necessarily agree with the interpretation assigned to them. The authors present
these results as showing a behavioural adaptation by individual scouts to their nest quality. I see
a different (and in my opinion more likely) explanation: with higher nest quality all but a few
‘super-scouts’ stop scouting. This non-random subsample of scouts also happen to walk slower,
make longer scouting bouts, and spend longer scouting. Thus, there is no change in the scouting
behaviour of individuals – just a removal of all but the most hard working scouts. Had the
individual scouts been assigned an identity (perhaps using the software id-Tracker (Pérez-
Escudero et al. 2014), although I realise this software is limited to a very few individuals), testing
which of these options is true would be possible. Without such individual ID information, both
options must be presented as (at least) equally likely.
In light of these concerns, I urge the authors to be much more cautious in both how they present
their results regarding individual behaviour, and in the conclusions drawn. This will require a
significant rewrite of the title, the abstract, the results, and the discussion. Frankly, I would
completely drop any claims being made about adjustment of individual-level behaviour.
With that said, as the experimental methods and data collection is solid, I believe that manuscript
will be acceptable for publication after a revision.

I hope the authors find my comments constructive and helpful.

I shall now make a series of more minor comments (split by section), aimed at improving the
manuscript.
ABSTRACT
• Line 16-18: this (division of labour) does not seem very relevant to the study
• Line 20-21 and elsewhere: you are (perhaps reasonably) assuming the ants are scouting
for a new nest, but in fact you do not know what the ants are doing. They may be searching for
food, patrolling for enemies, or searching for material with which to modify their nest. Caution is
required when assigning motivation to animal behaviour, as the motivational state of the animal
will strongly affect how it reacts to stimuli.
• Lines 22-24: some concrete numbers (percentages, ratios, etc) would not go amiss here.
• Line 26-27: looking at the effect strengths, it seems that the collective patterns are driven
almost exclusively by the number of bouts made in total.
BACKGROUND
• Line 51: “might be” – this has been concretely shown repeatedly, no?
• Line 53: in the reference list, ref 12 is formatted as a journal article, but it is fact a chapter
in a book.
• I feel a lot of the introduction is not strictly relevant, e.g. lines 46-52, and even as far as
line 62.
• Lines 55-58: I don’t see these as mutually exclusive.
• Lines 67-8: according to ref 21, the ants adapted rather poorly to microgravity. Indeed, I
feel this reference is a bit of a stretch.
• Line 72: “ultimately” replace with “finally”.
METHODS
• Line 104: add “sequentially” before “inhabit”.
• Figure 1 would be more informative if it was a grab from one of the videos, perhaps
showing some ant paths.
• As there is no id tracking in the video analysis, how can an ant running in and out of the
nest repeatedly be distinguished from many ants beginning scouting bouts? Is there a minimum
bout length cut-off? Figure S7 suggests mostly very short bouts. Are these, biologically speaking,
really scouting bouts?
• Line 127 – is the median speed a good measure to use here? The ants paths may be
characterised by mostly standing still, with bouts of rapid movement. If so, you'll miss changes in
these movement bouts if only the median is used. Overall distance per unit time might be more
informative.
• Supplementary code: I applaud the provision of the scripts and code. However, they
should be properly annotated in order to make them useful. As they stand, I cannot follow them.
For example, in the Rscript model summary modouts1, what are L, Q, C and 4? It took me a while
to realise this refers to linear, quadratic, cubic, etc). The same goes for Treat1-4.
• Line 137-8 – was square rooting nececcary here?
• Was the experiment order ever tested for an effect? Ants might give up scouting after
four weeks of not finding any new nest.
4
• Line 144 – it is not clear to me why linear, quadratic, cubic or 4th (!) order trends were
searched for. Was there any a-priori reason for doing this? In general, higher order trends should
only be looked for with good reason.
RESULTS
• Line 150 – I’m not sure “linearly” can be claimed for ordinal data.
• Line 162 – replace ‘work’ with ‘exploration’ or scouting
DISCUSSION
• Lines 224-226 - see main comments above.
• Line 230 – remove one comma
FIGURES
• Figure 1 – a screen grab with scale bars and ant paths would be more informative
• Figure 2 – Y axis should read “total number of EXPLORATION bouts”. For all figures –
what do the whiskers represent?
• Figures 3 & 4 – I dislike showing transformed data in figures. It is fine to use them for
statistical analysis, but I feel the raw numbers are more useful in a figure.
• Figure 3 – it would be nice to see similar figures to these, but with the path length and
exploration time divided by number of bouts. This would allow the reader to assess the
relationship between these variables, and would likely show that the number of bouts mostly
controls the other two variables.

This is a nice piece of work. It is interesting, it builds on previous work in a productive and useful
way and it is generally well-presented. The study is well framed, the Methods and Results are
clear and the Discussion is open-handed and does not overreach. It is not my nature to submit
short reviews and I know, with my Editor’s hat on, that short reviews are often unhelpful.
However, I thought this was a good study and I enjoyed reading the paper.
5
The only comments I have are:
I think the overall finding of the paper could be expressed more clearly in the Abstract – my issue
here was the use of “target nest”, which I think will not be immediately understood in that
context by someone not familiar with this body of work, and the use of “nest value”. I think there
is room here to be more plain and direct in the Abstract and tell the story in a more intuitive way
- “increasing current nest value” might make total sense but it seems to over complicate things.
However, this is a matter of taste rather than a “must address” comment
The Introduction is already quite long so it might be difficult to incorporate this, but…it would be
nice to have some discussion of nest finding and nest value in other (non-ant) species. Honeybees
are obvious of course, but also nesting birds choosing nest boxes etc.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
I have been asked to re-review the manuscript “Ant colonies explore less but individuals search
for longer when current housing conditions are better” By Doran et al. In my previous review I
reported that I found the collective aspect of this manuscript robust and worthy of publication (if
not novel) with only minor revisions (which the authors have now carried out). However, I was
very sceptical about the results pertaining to the reported modulation of individual-level
behaviours of scouting bout length (per bout) and scouting bout path length (per bout). While the
results came out “significant” (i.e. lower than P<0.05) the explanatory power of the effect was so
low as to be, to my eyes, meaningless. I thus strongly suggested removing all mention of the
individual level effects.
The authors disagreed with my assessment, stating:
“We agree that the effect size is indeed very small. However, these results corroborate the results
in Doran et al. 2013 (reference number 25) using another metric. In addition, for social systems
such as ant colonies, small effect sizes will have larger effects if there is social amplification such
as recruitment.”
They thus chose not to reconsider the validity of the conclusions they draw from the data.
I’m afraid I find this response wholly unconvincing.
8
Firstly, in Doran et al. (2013), which I had studied closely previously, and have now re-read, the
authors report changes in colony-level behaviour - the probability of ants scouting depending on
current nest quality, as measured by the number of ants scouting. The results we are debating
here pertain to changes in mean path length of a scouting bout, mean bout duration, and mean
speed of the scouting ants. I simply do not see how these results are a corroboration of the
findings of Doran et al. (2013).
I’m afraid the secondary argument, that social amplification will make smaller effects larger, also
feels very much like hand-waving. The recruitment system here famously shows linear feedback,
and so will not show such large amplification. I remind the authors that I previously estimated
the effect strength to be c. 1% - leaving 99% of the variation unexplained. This remaining 99% of
random variation will be amplified along with the putative 1% of signal, still resulting in little
biological relevance of the factors measured.
I thus cannot accept the response of the authors to my concern, and therefore still cannot
recommend that this manuscript be published in its current state. I reiterate my request that “the
authors be much more cautious in both how they present their results regarding individual
behaviour, and in the conclusions drawn. This will require a significant rewrite of the title, the
abstract, the results, and the discussion. Frankly, I would completely drop any claims being made
about adjustment of individual-level behaviour.”
I also stand by my previous comment, that
“With that said, as the experimental methods and data collection is solid, I believe that
manuscript will be acceptable for publication after a revision.”
The authors responded in much more detail to my subsidiary concern about the interpretation of
the individual behavioural patterns they report finding.. I somewhat regret raising this point, as it
perhaps took the emphasis off my main concern. Nonetheless, I appreciate the response of the
authors to my comment. I will respond to their response, but emphasise that without handling
my main point above, this debate is purely hypothetical.
In brief, I suggested that rather than adjustment of individual level behaviour, the putative
findings could be explained by a process of self-selecting subsets of ants. The authors argue that,
due to the variation within each groups not changing, one can rule out the hypothesis the
alternative hypothesis I raised. I find this to be rather weak evidence to hang the entire message
of the paper on. Indeed, why assume that the variance would decrease? The 'super-scouts' (see
original comment) might have the same variance, but with a shifted mean in other aspects of their
behaviour.
The authors go on to run some new statistical analyses in which the collective effects examined
are divided by the total number of bouts. They find opposite effects to the ones reported (good
that this is now added to the manuscript!). This is presented as further support for their
interpretation. They state:
“If the number of bouts was the cause of the variation in the collective effort we would expect
no trend at all after dividing the response variables by the number of bouts.”
True, but it is not clear to me how this rules out the super-scout hypothesis? It may just mean that
the super-scouts walk further and for longer, and make the same number of bouts. I’m still not
fully convinced, and think both hypotheses should have been equal weight. But, as I stated
earlier, I am not convinced that there is any real evidence of individual-level behavioural
differences between the treatments at all.
I am very sorry to be stubborn on this point – I know that this can be frustrating. I also realise
that, without the individual level behaviour, the results presented here are not greatly different to
9
those shown in Doran (2013). Nonetheless, I cannot in good conscience recommend this
manuscript for publication until I am fully convinced, or my suggestions are followed. Perhaps I
have misunderstood something key? If discussion via writing is not working, but the authors
really are convinced that they are right, I would be happy to talk in person (via skype or similar)
to try and work this out.
Yours sincerely,
Tomer Czaczkes
I will now respond to the ‘minor comments’ bits.
(old comment): Lines 22-24: some concrete numbers (percentages, ratios, etc) would not go amiss
here.
We don’t usually put values in the abstract as we think the abstract should give a general
overview of the
paper. However we are happy to do so if the editor sees fit
TC) no, I didn't mean results of statistical tests, so much as descriptive statistics. E.g. "the number
of scouting bouts was four times higher in poor compared to excellent nests”
(old comment):Figures 3 & 4 – I dislike showing transformed data in figures. It is fine to use them
for statistical
analysis, but I feel the raw numbers are more useful in a figure.
We completely agree with the referee, however, when the non-transformed data is skewed,
extreme values
could “squash” the presentation of most of the data and make the figure non informative
TC) Well, you could take out the outliers – the figures are only illustrations of the results, after all,
and should serve to help the readers get the main message. But this is all a matter of personal
taste.
Line 240 typo – ‘wile’ instead of ‘while’
All other minor responses and changes look good, and are approved.

Comments to the Author(s)
In this study, the exploration behaviour of the Rock Ant Temnothorax albipennis is studied.
Colonies are housed in nests of varying quality, and the number of exploration bouts, and their
total and individual lengths and durations, are measured. Two conclusions are drawn: Regarding
collective exploration, the authors conclude that overall exploration rates increase as current nest
value decreases. Regarding individual exploration, the authors conclude that exploration bout
length and duration increase with increasing nest quality, while instantaneous speed decreases.
The paper reads well, the motivation behind the experiments is sound, and the experimental
methodology is robust. The figures are clear and informative. The statistical analysis is, to my
knowledge, generally sound (see some minor comments at the end), although I cannot judge the
Python script. Indeed, I applaud the provision of both the preliminary data checking and the
scripts use to carry out the analysis (but see some minor comments) – this sort of transparency is
what most papers should strive for.
Dear Dr Czaczkes,
We are extremely grateful for all your encouraging words and all your suggestions for our
manuscript. We appreciate your very thorough review and will address now all of your comments.
I find the collective results robust, reliable and believable. I will make more detailed suggestions
at the end, but have no major comments regarding this aspect of the work.
However, I am very sceptical about the patterns described for the individual level behaviour.
While significant differences are found, and I can find no flaw in how the statistics were carried
out (I am no expert on the matter). However, the effect size seems from the figures to be very
small indeed. If we consider the breadth of the whiskers in all panels of figure 4, we see that
variation within groups is much, much greater than variation between groups. If we were to
consider non-transformed data, the whiskers would likely be even broader. While there is no
agreed upon equivalent for an R-squared value for generalised linear mixed-effect models
(GLMM), a rough estimate can be achieved by using an equivalent GLM. Using the raw data
supplied, I calculated such R-squared. Log bout duration vs treatment had an adjusted R squared
of 0.78% - less than 1% of the variation is explained by the treatment! Similar results are found for
speed (2.21%). Very large sample sizes (here they vary from 2205 to 648 samples per treatment)
can result in even tiny effects reaching significance. Just because an effect is statistically
significant does not mean it is either real or that it has biological meaning.
We agree that the effect size is indeed very small. However, these results corroborate the results
in Doran et al. 2013 (reference number 25) using another metric. In addition, for social systems
such as ant colonies, small effect sizes will have larger effects if there is social amplification such
as recruitment.
Even if we were to agree that these patterns represent real and important biological effects (which
I do not), I do not necessarily agree with the interpretation assigned to them. The authors present
these results as showing a behavioural adaptation by individual scouts to their nest quality. I see
a different (and in my opinion more likely) explanation: with higher nest quality all but a few
‘super-scouts’ stop scouting. This non-random subsample of scouts also happen to walk slower,
make longer scouting bouts, and spend longer scouting. Thus, there is no change in the scouting
behaviour of individuals – just a removal of all but the most hard working scouts. Had the
individual scouts been assigned an identity (perhaps using the software id-Tracker (Pérez-
Escudero et al. 2014), although I realise this software is limited to a very few individuals), testing
which of these options is true would be possible. Without such individual ID information, both
options must be presented as (at least) equally likely.
We appreciate the alternative interpretation of our results. In fact we had previously considered
such a scenario since it would go extremely well in line with the response threshold idea. If
colonies are composed of individuals with different response thresholds, we would expect that in
better housing conditions only individuals with a really high threshold would not be satisfied and
continue searching. However, if we compare the different treatments, the level of variation does
not seem to change that much. We have compared this using an F test, which is not the most
accurate way since it does not consider colony as a random factor, but it is enough to give us an
idea. For the duration, the F-ratio is not significantly different from 1, even with a sample size of
2204 points. For both path length and instantaneous speed it is significant but at 1.25 and 1.47
ratio respectively. Both are closer to 1 than to 2. If indeed in better housing conditions only the
‘super scouts’ would be scouting we would expect a gradual decrease in variation with increasing
nest value. As that is not the case, we think it is more likely the interpretation that the patterns
observed are a result of individual flexibility.
Furthermore, if we run the collective effort models (Total path length and Total path duration) but
with both response variables divided by the number of bouts, in both cases, we get a significant
positive linear trend with increasing nest value, with the addition of treatment to the models
having a highly significant effect (p <0.001 in both cases). This trend is opposite to the trend
obtained for total path length and total exploration behaviour when not divided by total number of
bouts. This is another piece of evidence in support of our interpretation. If the number of bouts
was the cause of the variation in the collective effort we would expect no trend at all after dividing
the response variables by the number of bouts.
We have added boxplots of both response variables divided by the number of bouts to the
supplementary information as well as the R code and output of the models. We have also added
some information regarding this analysis both in the results (lines 173 - 175) and in our discussion
(lines 211 - 216). We have also added a few lines to our discussion regarding the referee’s
interpretation since we do think that this alternative interpretation is highly relevant (lines 212 –
219).
We did consider id-Tracker, unfortunately it requires more pixels per ant than in our videos.
Something to keep in mind for future experiments.
In light of these concerns, I urge the authors to be much more cautious in both how they present
their results regarding individual behaviour, and in the conclusions drawn. This will require a
significant rewrite of the title, the abstract, the results, and the discussion. Frankly, I would
completely drop any claims being made about adjustment of individual-level behaviour.
With that said, as the experimental methods and data collection is solid, I believe that manuscript
will be acceptable for publication after a revision.
For the reasons justified above, we decided to keep the title and continue to favour our initial
interpretation. However we have now included the alternative interpretation by Dr Czaczkes.
I hope the authors find my comments constructive and helpful.
Yours sincerely,

Dear Dr Gzaczkes
We appreciate greatly the positive comments and encouragement. Please see our detailed point-
by-point responses below.
I shall now make a series of more minor comments (split by section), aimed at improving the
manuscript.
ABSTRACT
• Line 16-18: this (division of labour) does not seem very relevant to the study
We understand this concern and have made more obvious the relationship between our work and
division of labour on lines 58 - 64. This study focusses on how colonies organize their work, within
a single task and we believe that it might shed some light on more general models of work
organisation such as task allocation.
• Line 20-21 and elsewhere: you are (perhaps reasonably) assuming the ants are scouting for
a new nest, but in fact you do not know what the ants are doing. They may be searching for food,
patrolling for enemies, or searching for material with which to modify their nest. Caution is
required when assigning motivation to animal behaviour, as the motivational state of the animal
will strongly affect how it reacts to stimuli.
We agree with the reviewer that caution is required when assigning motivation to animal
behaviour. However, as shown both here and in one of our previous papers (reference number
25), with all else being equal, differences in the number of individuals outside have to be
attributed to changes in nest value. We have made this clearer in our discussion lines 257 – 258.
• Lines 22-24: some concrete numbers (percentages, ratios, etc) would not go amiss here.
We don’t usually put values in the abstract as we think the abstract should give a general
overview of the paper. However we are happy to do so if the editor sees fit.
• Line 26-27: looking at the effect strengths, it seems that the collective patterns are driven
almost exclusively by the number of bouts made in total.
As mentioned in our first response, the models including total path length and total exploration
duration divided by the number of bouts show a linear trend in the opposite direction in
comparison to when they are not divided by the number of bouts. Hence the total effort observed
is not a result of only variation in total number of bouts as if that was the case we would expect
that dividing total path length and total exploration time by the total number of bouts would
annihilate the effect of treatment.
We have chosen not to make any changes in the title and abstract but have addressed all the
referees concern in other sections.
BACKGROUND
• Line 51: “might be” – this has been concretely shown repeatedly, no?
We have updated line 49.
• Line 53: in the reference list, ref 12 is formatted as a journal article, but it is fact a chapter in
a book.
Thank you, we have corrected this reference.
• I feel a lot of the introduction is not strictly relevant, e.g. lines 46-52, and even as far as line
62.
We have made the connection between our work and division of labour clearer. See lines 58 –
64.
• Lines 55-58: I don’t see these as mutually exclusive.
We completely agree with this point and have added updated the manuscript, lines 58 - 60
• Lines 67-8: according to ref 21, the ants adapted rather poorly to microgravity. Indeed, I feel
this reference is a bit of a stretch.
We reference this paper to show other research where the same tracking software has been
used. We have made it clear that colonies indeed adapted very poorly. See line 70.
• Line 72: “ultimately” replace with “finally”.
We have made this correction, now line 74.
METHODS
• Line 104: add “sequentially” before “inhabit”.
We have made this correction, now line 104.
• Figure 1 would be more informative if it was a grab from one of the videos, perhaps showing
some ant paths.
We do agree with the referee, however the ants occupy only around 20 pixels and there are
several trajectories at the same time. Hence we find it not so informative. We think figure 1, as it
stands is quite an elegant diagram, which aims to visualise the experimental set up and how the
parameters were calculated.
• As there is no id tracking in the video analysis, how can an ant running in and out of the nest
repeatedly be distinguished from many ants beginning scouting bouts? Is there a minimum bout
length cut-off? Figure S7 suggests mostly very short bouts. Are these, biologically speaking,
really scouting bouts?
We are not able to distinguish if the same ant leaves more than once. We have made this clearer
in lines 118 – 119. We considered exploratory bouts as soon an ant’s full body entered the
scouting arena. This was done exactly the same way for all treatments.
• Line 127 – is the median speed a good measure to use here? The ants paths may be
characterised by mostly standing still, with bouts of rapid movement. If so, you'll miss changes in
these movement bouts if only the median is used. Overall distance per unit time might be more
informative.
This is a really good point. In fact we did look at number of seconds an ant is not moving and this
does not change significantly for the 5 nesting conditions. We do not think this information is
relevant for the paper but we can certainly add it if necessary.
• Supplementary code: I applaud the provision of the scripts and code. However, they should
be properly annotated in order to make them useful. As they stand, I cannot follow them. For
example, in the Rscript model summary modouts1, what are L, Q, C and 4? It took me a while to
realise this refers to linear, quadratic, cubic, etc). The same goes for Treat1-4.
We completely agree with this point and have added several comments to all the scripts.
• Line 137-8 – was square rooting necessary here?
We have chosen to square-root the data so that a linear mixed model could be used. Such
models require that the date is at least approximately normal.
• Was the experiment order ever tested for an effect? Ants might give up scouting after four
weeks of not finding any new nest.
We did look at the effect of order for all the response variables. We ran the following models:
Mod0 -> Response variable and colony as a random factor (Null model)
Mod1 -> Response variable, treatment as a fixed factor and colony as a random factor
Mod2 -> Response variable, treatment and order as a fixed factors and colony as a random factor
Mod3 -> Response variable, order as a fixed factor and colony as a random factor
For all 3 response variables (path length, duration and instantaneous speed) the comparison
between models Mod0 and Mod3 showed no significant differences. Furthermore comparing
models Mod1 with Mod 2 did show a significant difference but with a delta AIC of 2, 4 and 7 for
path length, duration and instantaneous speed respectively. According to Burnham and Anderson
(2001, 2nd edition) delta AIC > 10 are considered not to be competitive with the best model. Also
for all cases Mod2 only showed a significant fit to cubic and 4 th order trends which do not have a
biological meaning and so we chose the model with only treatment as a fixed factor.
The supplementary information is already quite vast and so we chose to leave all this information
out but we are happy to add it if necessary.
• Line 144 – it is not clear to me why linear, quadratic, cubic or 4th (!) order trends were
searched for. Was there any a-priori reason for doing this? In general, higher order trends should
only be looked for with good reason.
We completely agree with the referee. That is why in our interpretation we focus on the linear
trend and overall positive or negative direction as these are of biological interest. By definition the
max order of trends in a model is equal to the number of categories minus 1, hence with five nest
qualities the software automatically gives from linear to 4th order trend.
RESULTS
• Line 150 – I’m not sure “linearly” can be claimed for ordinal data.
We agree with the referee and have removed the word linearly from here as it causes confusion
between linear relationship and a linear contrast.
• Line 162 – replace ‘work’ with ‘exploration’ or scouting
We agree and have made this change now in line 159
DISCUSSION
• Lines 224-226 - see main comments above.
Already discussed above
• Line 230 – remove one comma
We agree and have removed one of the commas, lines 232 – 233.
FIGURES
• Figure 1 – a screen grab with scale bars and ant paths would be more informative
Already discussed above
• Figure 2 – Y axis should read “total number of EXPLORATION bouts”. For all figures – what
do the whiskers represent?
We agree and have made the change to the figure label. The whiskers represent the nearest
value within 1.5 of the interquartile range. We find this to be the default for most software’s. We
have added this information to the figure labels.
• Figures 3 & 4 – I dislike showing transformed data in figures. It is fine to use them for
statistical analysis, but I feel the raw numbers are more useful in a figure.
We completely agree with the referee, however, when the non-transformed data is skewed,
extreme values could “squash” the presentation of most of the data and make the figure non
informative.
• Figure 3 – it would be nice to see similar figures to these, but with the path length and
exploration time divided by number of bouts. This would allow the reader to assess the
relationship between these variables, and would likely show that the number of bouts mostly
controls the other two variables.
We have done this and have added to the supplementary figure document (figure S33). We have
added a sentence referring to these to the main document. Lines 174 – 176. If the number of
bouts controlled most of the other variables we would expect no trend, but instead we found a
positive trend (as expected based on the individual bout analysis).

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a nice piece of work. It is interesting, it builds on previous work in a productive and useful
way and it is generally well-presented. The study is well framed, the Methods and Results are
clear and the Discussion is open-handed and does not overreach. It is not my nature to submit
short reviews and I know, with my Editor’s hat on, that short reviews are often unhelpful.
However, I thought this was a good study and I enjoyed reading the paper.
We thank the referee for the encouraging comments on our manuscript.
The only comments I have are:
I think the overall finding of the paper could be expressed more clearly in the Abstract – my issue
here was the use of “target nest”, which I think will not be immediately understood in that context
by someone not familiar with this body of work, and the use of “nest value”. I think there is room
here to be more plain and direct in the Abstract and tell the story in a more intuitive way -
“increasing current nest value” might make total sense but it seems to over complicate things.
However, this is a matter of taste rather than a “must address” comment
We agree with the referee that even though this terms are very obvious to us they might not be to
some readers and hence we have changed the abstract Lines 20, 21 and 24).
The Introduction is already quite long so it might be difficult to incorporate this, but…it would be
nice to have some discussion of nest finding and nest value in other (non-ant) species.
Honeybees are obvious of course, but also nesting birds choosing nest boxes etc.
We agree with this point and since our introduction was indeed already long we have included a
paragraph in the discussion regarding house hunting in other animal species, lines (238 - 244).

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
I have been asked to re-review the manuscript “Ant colonies explore less but individuals search
for longer when current housing conditions are better” By Doran et al. In my previous review I
reported that I found the collective aspect of this manuscript robust and worthy of publication (if
not novel) with only minor revisions (which the authors have now carried out). However, I was
very sceptical about the results pertaining to the reported modulation of individual-level
behaviours of scouting bout length (per bout) and scouting bout path length (per bout). While the
results came out “significant” (i.e. lower than P<0.05) the explanatory power of the effect was so
24
low as to be, to my eyes, meaningless. I thus strongly suggested removing all mention of the
individual level effects.
Dear Tomer Czaczkes,
We are extremely grateful for all the time and effort you have invested in our manuscript. After
careful consideration we have decided to take your advice. We have now made changes to the
title, abstract, results and discussion. The manuscript now focuses mainly on the collective
responses. However we still discuss the idea of individual adjustment and quote 2 papers where
small effect size actually showed a significant effect on the collective.
We hope you are now happy with the manuscript. We will now respond to every point separately.
The authors disagreed with my assessment, stating:
“We agree that the effect size is indeed very small. However, these results corroborate the results
in Doran et al. 2013 (reference number 25) using another metric. In addition, for social systems
such as ant colonies, small effect sizes will have larger effects if there is social amplification such
as recruitment.”
They thus chose not to reconsider the validity of the conclusions they draw from the data.
I’m afraid I find this response wholly unconvincing.
Firstly, in Doran et al. (2013), which I had studied closely previously, and have now re-read, the
authors report changes in colony-level behaviour - the probability of ants scouting depending on
current nest quality, as measured by the number of ants scouting. The results we are debating
here pertain to changes in mean path length of a scouting bout, mean bout duration, and mean
speed of the scouting ants. I simply do not see how these results are a corroboration of the
findings of Doran et al. (2013).
I’m afraid the secondary argument, that social amplification will make smaller effects larger, also
feels very much like hand-waving. The recruitment system here famously shows linear feedback,
and so will not show such large amplification. I remind the authors that I previously estimated the
effect strength to be c. 1% - leaving 99% of the variation unexplained. This remaining 99% of
random variation will be amplified along with the putative 1% of signal, still resulting in little
biological relevance of the factors measured.
I thus cannot accept the response of the authors to my concern, and therefore still cannot
recommend that this manuscript be published in its current state. I reiterate my request that “the
authors be much more cautious in both how they present their results regarding individual
behaviour, and in the conclusions drawn. This will require a significant rewrite of the title, the
abstract, the results, and the discussion. Frankly, I would completely drop any claims being made
about adjustment of individual-level behaviour.”
We have now made changes to the title, abstract (lines 22 – 26), results (lines 185 – 186) and
discussion (lines 211 – 212, 219 – 224 and 271 – 272). We have maintained a few lines in the
discussion arguing how the individual effect might still influence the collective pattern observed,
even though very small. The same had been previously shown in reference 34 and 35. However
we have taken on board the suggestion of the referee and have changed the manuscript such
that equal weight is given to both interpretations.
I also stand by my previous comment, that
“With that said, as the experimental methods and data collection is solid, I believe that manuscript
will be acceptable for publication after a revision.”
The authors responded in much more detail to my subsidiary concern about the interpretation of
the individual behavioural patterns they report finding. I somewhat regret raising this point, as it
perhaps took the emphasis off my main concern. Nonetheless, I appreciate the response of the
authors to my comment. I will respond to their response, but emphasise that without handling my
main point above, this debate is purely hypothetical.
In brief, I suggested that rather than adjustment of individual level behaviour, the putative findings
could be explained by a process of self-selecting subsets of ants. The authors argue that, due to
the variation within each groups not changing, one can rule out the hypothesis the alternative
hypothesis I raised. I find this to be rather weak evidence to hang the entire message of the paper
on. Indeed, why assume that the variance would decrease? The 'super-scouts' (see original
comment) might have the same variance, but with a shifted mean in other aspects of their
behaviour.
We very much agree with this point. In fact these data support the suggestion to combine both
interpretations: There could be a process of self-selecting ants, and such ants might be adjusting
their behaviour and that might be why the effect size is rather small. We have added this idea
both in the abstract (lines 22 – 26) and discussion (221 – 224).
The authors go on to run some new statistical analyses in which the collective effects examined
are divided by the total number of bouts. They find opposite effects to the ones reported (good
that this is now added to the manuscript!). This is presented as further support for their
interpretation. They state:
“If the number of bouts was the cause of the variation in the collective effort we would expect
no trend at all after dividing the response variables by the number of bouts.”
True, but it is not clear to me how this rules out the super-scout hypothesis? It may just mean that
the super-scouts walk further and for longer, and make the same number of bouts. I’m still not
fully convinced, and think both hypotheses should have been equal weight. But, as I stated
earlier, I am not convinced that there is any real evidence of individual-level behavioural
differences between the treatments at all.
I am very sorry to be stubborn on this point – I know that this can be frustrating. I also realise that,
without the individual level behaviour, the results presented here are not greatly different to those
shown in Doran (2013). Nonetheless, I cannot in good conscience recommend this manuscript for
publication until I am fully convinced, or my suggestions are followed. Perhaps I have
misunderstood something key? If discussion via writing is not working, but the authors really are
convinced that they are right, I would be happy to talk in person (via skype or similar) to try and
work this out.
Yours sincerely,
Tomer Czaczkes
Again, we are very grateful for all the investment of time and effort by the referee in out
manuscript. We have taken on board your suggestion and have acknowledged that for the
individual level the effect size is very small and argue that we might have a combination of both
processes. A self-selection of the most hard-working ants who might be adjusting their behaviour
to their current housing conditions. We are very happy with this improved version and hope it is
now suitable for publication.
I will now respond to the ‘minor comments’ bits.
(old comment): Lines 22-24: some concrete numbers (percentages, ratios, etc) would not go
amiss here.
We don’t usually put values in the abstract as we think the abstract should give a general
overview of the
paper. However we are happy to do so if the editor sees fit
TC) no, I didn't mean results of statistical tests, so much as descriptive statistics. E.g. "the
number of scouting bouts was four times higher in poor compared to excellent nests”
The number of bouts is 5 times smaller in excellent nests in comparison with Poor nest sites,
however, due to the word limit of the abstract we have chosen no to add this. However, if the
reviewer and editor advise us otherwise, we are happy to add this information.
(old comment):Figures 3 & 4 – I dislike showing transformed data in figures. It is fine to use them
for statistical
analysis, but I feel the raw numbers are more useful in a figure.
We completely agree with the referee, however, when the non-transformed data is skewed,
extreme values
could “squash” the presentation of most of the data and make the figure non informative
TC) Well, you could take out the outliers – the figures are only illustrations of the results, after all,
and should serve to help the readers get the main message. But this is all a matter of personal
taste.
We have discussed this at length but we don’t like removing outliers and have chosen to maintain
the transformed data.
Line 240 typo – ‘wile’ instead of ‘while’

All other minor responses and changes look good, and are approved.
