Werth et al. contribute an important, timely, and thorough study to address a basic question
mostly unaddressed by anyone: does petroleum-based oils affect whale baleen? Surprisingly, no
one has really tested this idea, and I applaud Werth et al. for a robust effort in mechanics,
experimental design, and ecological context. I found a lot to like in this study, and see it as a
fundamental finding that will garner many citations in the future -- after all, there will only be
more whales mired in human-generated oil spills, not fewer (unfortunately).
I actually have no major issues with the manuscript in terms of structure or execution. The
paper's clearly thought out, the materials are appropriately sourced and handled, and the authors
provided a clear window into their thought process about mechanical tissue properties, and how
to test for a signal. Their findings are interesting and noteworthy for a broad readership.
I don't need to see this manuscript again; just minor issues that should be corrected in their
revisions:
Abstract:
There needs to be a sentence about what baleen is, what it's made out of, and why anyone
(biologist or not) might care about. I realize that's a hard sentence to write, but it's important as
the audience for RSOS is broad. There really needs to be more of a hook for the reader, in other
words. I suggest "Baleen whales filter feed using..."
Scientific names should also be used instead of common names, especially in the abstract. Also,
please use full words -- e.g., "and" and "or" -- instead of back slashes, which are brief and
stylistically modern but not as informative as real words.
l. 17, Be specific -- species of whale. Potentially confused with prey species.
MAIN TEXT
l. 25, Again, provide more context about what a mysticete is. Realize that many readers of RSOS
might not even know that we're talking about whales! I also think this is a key place to expand on
that first sentence in the abstract describing the composition of baleen -- what is it, who has it,
what does it do. It needs not be long, but it does need to be here, at this point in the manuscript.
l. 37, Eubalaena spp., period missing after "app"
l. 39, Family is not capitalized. And please use ">" instead of "+" for the words "in excess of"
l. 42, Please cite a general reference (e.g., the Kraus Urban Whale book) for why it is that right
whales are endangered. A general reader might not know.
ll. 58-62, I don't think this formatting is necessary. It would be more seamless and artful, prose-
wise, to have it inline with the text as full sentences. It wouldn't take much, and it would be
worth the effort.
3
l. 70, Family is not capitalized.
l. 231, spell out 4 out of 120.
ll. 260, 287. Again, backslashes are lazy and not communicating the nuance intended -- and or?
Just and? Please be specific for mechanical strength and/or flexibility + cleansing and or clearing
l. 332. Or only for copepod-feeding mysticete? Isn't that just balaenids? Or do some mid-size
rorquals feed on copepods? Specificity is warranted here.
L. 337, I am not a fan at all of checklist conclusions. The formatting is unappealing, it breaks from
the rest of the manuscript, and it comes off as a bit lazy to me. I would appreciate the extra effort
to write it out, in a few sentences. Doesn't take much, and it makes a big difference.

I found this to be a very interesting paper for a number of reasons, including the implications for
the real-world environment the whales inhabit. The findings of this study are consistent with
unpublished findings of a different research team that recently examined oil effects on baleen
performance, and the implications discussed are consistent across both studies. I thought the use
of multiple and qualitatively different endpoints was useful and appropriate, and strengthened
the overall conclusions. The only quibble I have with this work is that the choice of petroleum
test products was somewhat less than satisfying, in that all are refined/processed and not
representative of the petroleum oils likely to be encountered in the environment (i.e., fuel or
crude oils). I understand the issues and risks associated in working with, for example, crude oils,
but an intermediate or heavy fuel oil would have provided an important reference that I'm not
sure the other petroleum products provide. Similarly, given the ongoing controversies associated
4
with the use of chemical oil dispersants, inclusion of a representative product in the testing also
would have been desirable. However: all other things being equal, this is a nice piece of work
and well-thought out and implemented.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Denise Greig):
This is a well constructed study that builds on the growing literature around balleen by
considering how environmental pollution impacts balleen structure and function, and ultimately
ingestion of pollutants. I would have loved to see some heavier oil and some oil dispersants
tested as well, but maybe those will be part of future work. The manuscript is generally well
written, but I got a bit lost in some of the different treatments and their terminology. I think this
can be easily fixed relatively easily with a few definitions for a broader readership and consistent
use of the words you use to describe your work. Below are some specific areas where I was
confused.
7
Line 171. I was not sure what you meant when you said “submerged or painted”. Are these two
separate oil treatments (1. submerged in oil for 7 days and 2. “painted” with oil) or just two ways
to describe the same thing?
Line 186-189. This paragraph is confusing. I would prefer that you report the p values in the same
sentences where you report the direction of the statistically signficant effect. For example,
hydrated baleen gained more mass than air-dried baleen (p=….) rather than comparing the
significance of two separate results (i.e. to say that something is more significant than something
else based on the p value of 0.02 versus 0.04 is probably not meaningful numerically or
biologically). I’m also confused by the word adsorption. I thought these results were reporting on
proportional mass change as a proxy for adherence. If adsorption and adherence are
synonymous, I would pick one word and stick with it. It is also not clear whether relative and
proportional mass gain are the same or two different measures. Is proportional when you
compare the within balleen treatments and relative when you compare between treatments?
Line 226. Please add no “visible” residue….
Line 299-301. I think I am confused by Table 1 so I am not understanding how it relates to the text
here. The text says the hydrated balleen decreased in mass after submersion in oil, but when I
look at the table, the proportional changes are all above one so I thought that meant the mass
increased. The title of the table is also confusing – it sounds like dried balleen was submerged in
either water or oil, however the table appears to be balleen that was either dried or hydrated, and
then all of the samples were submerged in oil. It is also unclear what the column labelled H2O
means or why it is italicized.
Line 303. This seems to contradict the line before…does oil displace water or water displace oil?
Line 322. The “recognized olfatory ability” of whales is referenced in this sentence, but when I
looked at the reference, it said that the mysticetes have a functional olfactory bulb (compared to
odontocetes which have none), but are missing the genes used to actually "smell" and that they
lack the ability to avoid "spoiled smells". I wonder if they have another way to detect oils in their
prey. Either way, please re-word this sentence to accurately reflect this earlier work.
Line 335. Your conclusion about microplastics seems contradictory to the sentence before where
you suggest the ingestion risk from oil is enhanced because it does not adhere to the balleen and
is more easily swallowed (that makes sense to me). I don’t disagree that microplastic ingestion is
a global risk for these animals (especially the benthic feeding whales), I just am not sure how you
are proposing that is more risky than oil ingestion. Or maybe ingestion risk is not exactly what
you mean. Maybe exposure risk from ingestion? I am not sure what the risk is from having
microplastics stuck in your balleen (exposure to chemicals on the plastics, balleen become less
functional if full of microplastics)? I think you need to expand or clarify this assertion.

s is a well constructed study that builds on the growing literature around balleen by
sidering how environmental pollution impacts balleen structure and function, and ultimately
stion of pollutants. I would have loved to see some heavier oil and some oil dispersants
ed as well, but maybe those will be part of future work. The manuscript is generally well
ten, but I got a bit lost in some of the different treatments and their terminology. I think this
be easily fixed relatively easily with a few definitions for a broader readership and consistent
of the words you use to describe your work. Below are some specific areas where I was
fused.
ponse: We have added mention that experimentation is ongoing with heavier fuel oils and
mical dispersants.
have clarified the confusing sections about different treatments (both in the text and Table)
standardized definitions by referring only to adsorption and not adherence. Adsorption
ns adherence to a surface, but we agree that using both terms is potentially confusing to
ers. We have also added some introductory information to make our paper more accessible
wide audience.
e 171. I was not sure what you meant when you said “submerged or painted”. Are these two
arate oil treatments (1. submerged in oil for 7 days and 2. “painted” with oil) or just two ways
escribe the same thing?
ponse: We can see how this was confusing. We were trying to be concise but needed
oration here, which we have added to explain that because oil often ran off baleen samples
ore flow tank trials could get underway, we “painted” oil on the samples to replicate what
were like when pulled from the oil in which they were submerged.
e 186-189. This paragraph is confusing. I would prefer that you report the p values in the
e sentences where you report the direction of the statistically signficant effect. For example,
rated baleen gained more mass than air-dried baleen (p=….) rather than comparing the
ificance of two separate results (i.e. to say that something is more significant than something
based on the p value of 0.02 versus 0.04 is probably not meaningful numerically or
ogically).
ponse: We agree this was confusing, and we have followed this advice in fixing it.
also confused by the word adsorption. I thought these results were reporting on proportional
s change as a proxy for adherence. If adsorption and adherence are synonymous, I would
one word and stick with it.
ponse: Adsorption and adherence are basically synonymous, but we agree it is easier to use
one term. Thus we have eliminated mention of adherence. We hope this eliminates
fusion.
also not clear whether relative and proportional mass gain are the same or two different
sures. Is proportional when you compare the within balleen treatments and relative when you
pare between treatments?
ponse: Again, we can see how this was confusing. We have eliminated the term
oportional” which we were just using as a synonym for “relative.”
e 226. Please add no “visible” residue….
ponse: We made this simple change.
e 299-301. I think I am confused by Table 1 so I am not understanding how it relates to the
here. The text says the hydrated balleen decreased in mass after submersion in oil, but when
ok at the table, the proportional changes are all above one so I thought that meant the mass
eased. The title of the table is also confusing – it sounds like dried balleen was submerged in
er water or oil, however the table appears to be balleen that was either dried or hydrated, and
all of the samples were submerged in oil. It is also unclear what the column labelled H2O
ns or why it is italicized.
ponse: We think the Table was the most confusing part of the paper and we spent much time
sing it to add clarity and avoid confusion. First, we have moved the column labeled H2O,
ch is (for reference) just weights of baleen submerged in water. The other columns show
ghts of baleen after submersion in a week in various oils following a different initial week in
er air or water. This shows that wet baleen repels oil better than dried baleen. We have not
y moved columns but changed the column headings and altered the heading/caption for this
e for greater clarity. We think it makes much more sense now.
e 303. This seems to contradict the line before…does oil displace water or water displace oil?
ponse: We have expanded this sentence to clarify this. In short, we think both things are
pening: wet baleen (with water that previously infiltrated the tissue) repels oil, and surface oil
aleen repels free water.
e 322. The “recognized olfactory ability” of whales is referenced in this sentence, but when I
ked at the reference, it said that the mysticetes have a functional olfactory bulb (compared to
ntocetes which have none), but are missing the genes used to actually "smell" and that they
the ability to avoid "spoiled smells". I wonder if they have another way to detect oils in their
y. Either way, please re-word this sentence to accurately reflect this earlier work.
ponse: There has been much study of the mysticete sense of smell, particularly in bowhead
les. We added another reference to this research. Many whale biologists believe whales can
se the dimethyl sulfide (DMS) that gives seafood its distinctive smell, and that this is how
detect krill or other zooplankton. Without going into detail here, we cite relevant research,
we also slightly expanded and clarified our points here in the Discussion.
e 335. Your conclusion about microplastics seems contradictory to the sentence before where
suggest the ingestion risk from oil is enhanced because it does not adhere to the balleen and
ore easily swallowed (that makes sense to me). I don’t disagree that microplastic ingestion is
obal risk for these animals (especially the benthic feeding whales), I just am not sure how
are proposing that is more risky than oil ingestion. Or maybe ingestion risk is not exactly
t you mean. Maybe exposure risk from ingestion? I am not sure what the risk is from having
roplastics stuck in your balleen (exposure to chemicals on the plastics, balleen become less
ctional if full of microplastics)? I think you need to expand or clarify this assertion.
ponse: Yes, we did need to clarify this assertion, and to do so we expanded it as suggested.
do think that the risk of oil ingestion, while present, is minimal because oil does not seem to
ck” to baleen. In contrast, baleen readily traps microplastic, leading to serious potential for
stion, along with greater potential for plastic fouling (clogging) of the filter relative to oil.

est for a signal. Their findings are interesting and noteworthy for a broad readership.
n't need to see this manuscript again; just minor issues that should be corrected in their
sions:
tract:
re needs to be a sentence about what baleen is, what it's made out of, and why anyone
logist or not) might care about. I realize that's a hard sentence to write, but it's important as
audience for RSOS is broad. There really needs to be more of a hook for the reader, in other
ds. I suggest "Baleen whales filter feed using..."
ponse: This is a good idea and we were happy to add an opening sentence just as suggested.
ntific names should also be used instead of common names, especially in the abstract.
ponse: This was easily remedied.
o, please use full words -- e.g., "and" and "or" -- instead of back slashes, which are brief and
istically modern but not as informative as real words.
ponse: We are sorry that we had used so many slashes (largely to decrease the word count).
have tried to eliminate nearly all slash use by adding proper conjunctions.
7, Be specific -- species of whale. Potentially confused with prey species.
ponse: We made this logical change.
IN TEXT
5, Again, provide more context about what a mysticete is. Realize that many readers of RSOS
ht not even know that we're talking about whales! I also think this is a key place to expand on
first sentence in the abstract describing the composition of baleen -- what is it, who has it,
t does it do. It needs not be long, but it does need to be here, at this point in the manuscript.
ponse: As with the Abstract, we added a bit of necessary background here to aid all readers.
7, Eubalaena spp., period missing after "app"
ponse: We added the missing period.
9, Family is not capitalized. And please use ">" instead of "+" for the words "in excess of"
ponse: We changed the word family and we used a greater than symbol (>).
2, Please cite a general reference (e.g., the Kraus Urban Whale book) for why it is that right
les are endangered. A general reader might not know.
ponse: We added a new citation here: not the popular Kraus book but a similar article from
nce.
8-62, I don't think this formatting is necessary. It would be more seamless and artful, prose-
e, to have it inline with the text as full sentences. It wouldn't take much, and it would be
th the effort.
ponse: We thought the slimmer format was easier to scan, but we gladly made this change.
0, Family is not capitalized.
ponse: We omitted the word “family” here.
31, spell out 4 out of 120.
ponse: Done.
60, 287. Again, backslashes are lazy and not communicating the nuance intended -- and or?
and? Please be specific for mechanical strength and/or flexibility + cleansing and or clearing
ponse: We now spell all of these out, having eliminated slash marks throughout the revision.
32. Or only for copepod-feeding mysticete? Isn't that just balaenids? Or do some mid-size
uals feed on copepods? Specificity is warranted here.
ponse: Good point—a rorqual (the sei whale) also feeds on copepods, as we now make clear.
37, I am not a fan at all of checklist conclusions. The formatting is unappealing, it breaks
m the rest of the manuscript, and it comes off as a bit lazy to me. I would appreciate the extra
rt to write it out, in a few sentences. Doesn't take much, and it makes a big difference.
ponse: We changed the numbered conclusions to a single paragraph as suggested.
iewer: 2
mments to the Author(s)
und this to be a very interesting paper for a number of reasons, including the implications for
real-world environment the whales inhabit. The findings of this study are consistent with
ublished findings of a different research team that recently examined oil effects on baleen
ormance, and the implications discussed are consistent across both studies. I thought the use
ultiple and qualitatively different endpoints was useful and appropriate, and strengthened the
rall conclusions. The only quibble I have with this work is that the choice of petroleum test
ducts was somewhat less than satisfying, in that all are refined/processed and not
esentative of the petroleum oils likely to be encountered in the environment (i.e., fuel or
de oils). I understand the issues and risks associated in working with, for example, crude oils,
an intermediate or heavy fuel oil would have provided an important reference that I'm not
the other petroleum products provide. Similarly, given the ongoing controversies associated
h the use of chemical oil dispersants, inclusion of a representative product in the testing also
ld have been desirable. However: all other things being equal, this is a nice piece of work
well-thought out and implemented.
ponse: We are glad Reviewer 2 enjoyed the paper. Reviewer 2 is correct that working with
de or heavy oils is more difficult, but we are currently engaged in such experiments (and also
h chemical oil dispersants), as we now make clear.
