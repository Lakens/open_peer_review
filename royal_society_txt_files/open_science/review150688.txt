The presented paper considers such an important question as structural decomposition of urban
growth using a new recently available dataset of Foursquare check-ins. The clustering of the
world top 100 cities according to their growth structure is presented and the spatial correlation
between growth vectors is established (i.e. closer cities tend to demonstrate higher similarity in
terms of their growth vectors), which seems to be an interesting, although rather expected
finding. Further this macro-scale analysis is complemented with a very interesting micro-scale
considerations, showing for which categories of the venues, opening of a new one nearby usually
have negative/positive impact.
Although this second part of the paper seems slightly disconnected from the first one (mainly the
connection is in the data used, while the questions asked in the two parts seem to tell two rather
different stories), the paper is an interesting reading, providing valuable insights.
At the same time certain shortcomings have to be mentioned. First of all, the metric being
studied, although being relevant, cannot be really interpreted as a characteristic of urban growth
for several reasons: a) it does not address the growth as while new venues are getting opened all
the time, a substantial fraction of the old ones is getting closed, which is not addressed by the
methodology in any way, so what is measured is rather a combination of the growth and
turnover, rather than purely growth; b) while the number of venues is an important factor,
another critical one is their size, which is not considered; moreover imposing a necessary
threshold on the minimal activity of the venue to be considered introduce a bias – this way
different fraction of the venues is considered for different commercial categories as those might
have different fractions of smaller venues, which might appear too small for passing the selected
threshold c) finally as the venues offering services represent only one side of the urban system
(commercial offering), one should exercise caution claiming the dynamics in those venues as a
proxy for the growth of the entire urban system. Also while the authors undertake a worthy
effort to discuss biases and limitations of the dataset, it would be a good idea to discuss the bias
related to the possible heterogeneity of Foursquare representativeness across different categories
of customer activity, which might also vary in different geographical areas, being dependent on
cultural habits and preferences of the population.
On the other notice, the second – relative – version of the growth vector (2) does not seem to
make too much sense to me, as it might be heavily affected by the fractions Nnew/Nold which
could become pretty random for a number of smaller commercial categories. Perhaps this is the
reason why meaningful patterns, such as spatial correlation vanish for such a definition.
All said, although I see this is an interesting research with significant merit, some improvements
would be helpful before the paper can be published.

Review of " Tracking Urban Activity Growth Globally with Big Location Data" (RSOS-150688)
This paper harnesses large-scale location ("check-in") data from Foursquare to systematically
study the growth of cities across the world in terms of their venues (businesses and other urban
functions). Specifically, it presents a set of new data-driven methods to i) identify different types
cities according to different growth patterns, ii) to identify local hot-spots of growth and iii) to
assess the effect of new venues on existing ones in terms of their popularity.
I very much enjoyed reading the paper and I believe it is a significant contribution to the existing
literature on the growth dynamics of cities. While data from Foursquare certainly has its
limitations (which are properly discussed by the authors), the paper introduces interesting
techniques and case studies that clearly demonstrate the potential of this kind of data for the
quantitative study of cities. As such, I can highly recommend this paper to be published in the
label_version_2
RSOS special issue.
Besides a few typos, I have only a few really minor points that might be addressed when
preparing the final version:
1. In section III. A, the authors write that "Athens shows a blossoming nightlife scene...".
However, as far as I understand from equation 1, Figure 1 shows only relative values. I would
suggest to slightly soften this statement by saying that the nightlife scene is blossoming when
compared to the other categories.
2. In section III. B, second paragraph, I guess the grid size is given in meters?
3. In section IV, the term "transition" in equation 5 was not clear to me. Does a transition
correspond to a check-in to a location? I think it would be helpful if the authors could clarify this
term.

Authors say they will:
1) track urban growth patterns, in terms of new place creation
2) areas in a city that surge in terms of development
3) emergence of new urban activities in a neighbourhood influences existing locations
and I believe they reach these accomplishments.
Regarding:"A new inter-disciplinary field: urban data science."
I understand that this is a good way to introduce your work, but "urban data science" might rub
people the wrong way, especially urban planners and urban sociologists. I do very similar work,
and have worked with the people you cite, but I still wouldn't introduce research like that, as
right now, we very much do not have things down to a science ;).
Regarding: "However, advances in city science have not only come from work primarily
concerned with classical urban geography and ecology problems, but have also been driven by
computer science and related mobile technologies that lie at the centre of today’s digital
revolution."
Describe briefly how what you will do has been done traditionally. That way, users can see the
difference. Urban growth patterns have been tracked with census data, remotely sensed imagery
and modeled with cellular automata. Areas of "surging" have also been looked at with car counts,
business revenue, etc. And urban activities with real estate records, traffic, etc. (similar to the
surging).
This will make for a stronger intro--your readers are likely to learn more this way.
The abstract needs commas. after the terms: in this paper; initially; subsequently.

Please fix bibliography--i.e. websites need more info. and a few other things.
foot traffic --> pedestrian traffic
these categories shouldn't be upper case: (Nightlife spot, Travel & Transport, Hotel etc.),
(Colleges & Universities, Schools, Government Buildings etc.). I realize this might not be your
first choice, but it's grammatically correct to keep them lower (maybe italicize?)
"This hopefully removes the majority of false venues added by users, either mistakenly or
maliciously." or locations that are just not popular....
" for each city the dataset also contains all “transitions” occurring within the city." fix.
This is a hole in your methodology (that could be fixed easily) "the start time, end time, source
venue and destination venue" -how will you geolocate the venues? (i.e. translate them to long/lat
or to a building in a geodtabase)
Can we exploit crowdsourced data --> Can we use crowdsourced data
In Appendix A, we provide a detailed description
of the filtering methodology..... This is good, but can you tell us a little bit about it before you
point us to the appendix? Maybe a few sentences to summarize, and then when people want
more detail they an go to the appendix.
I like your results from figure 1.
How did you get the categories (are they standard on Foursquare?) (apologies if I missed this).
Can you tell us the tightness of each cluster from Fig 2? (i.e. the RMSE within each cluster) It's
good that you note that the airport was new for Dubai and Queens---and perhaps that Brazil is
creating new universities. It's good to put this context.
In addition to the Haversine distance, can you enumerate the contents/regions? That would be
appropriate because your heading does reference geography, and being within the same
continent sometimes means more than being near in Euclidean distance.
Typo in "Can data from location-based services can be..."
Figure 4 may be eliminated if you'd like. It doesn't add really add more information than the text
provides. Without it, it seems that viewers may pay more attention to figure 5, which is
interesting.
"This pattern appears to reflect well the fact that development happens strategically as dictated
by the city's authorities"....yes maybe, it also shows that development happens in clusters as well,
a 'rich-get-richer' effect or 'piggy-backing' effect where new places take advantage of other new
openings, or emerging hot spots. It's not necessarily policy, although that could play a role. But I
suppose you explore that in the next section~
Reorder Table IV highest to lowest as you do with table VI.

I understand the problem that the authors are facing regarding data availability and am
sympathetic. However it may have sounded like there was an API that the public can access. It
sounds like there is: "More than 80 thousand applications rely on, and contribute to, its data
ecosystem through its API." I looked at the website---do you need a 'client'' key?

Comments to the Author(s)
The presented paper considers such an important question as structural decomposition of urban
growth using a new recently available dataset of Foursquare check-ins. The clustering of the
world top 100 cities according to their growth structure is presented and the spatial correlation
between growth vectors is established (i.e. closer cities tend to demonstrate higher similarity in
terms of their growth vectors), which seems to be an interesting, although rather expected
finding. Further this macro-scale analysis is complemented with a very interesting micro-scale
considerations, showing for which categories of the venues, opening of a new one nearby usually
have negative/positive impact.
Although this second part of the paper seems slightly disconnected from the first one (mainly the
connection is in the data used, while the questions asked in the two parts seem to tell two rather
different stories), the paper is an interesting reading, providing valuable insights.
At the same time certain shortcomings have to be mentioned. First of all, the metric being
studied, although being relevant, cannot be really interpreted as a characteristic of urban growth
for several reasons: a) it does not address the growth as while new venues are getting opened all
the time, a substantial fraction of the old ones is getting closed, which is not addressed by the
methodology in any way, so what is measured is rather a combination of the growth and
turnover, rather than purely growth; b) while the number of venues is an important factor,
another critical one is their size, which is not considered; moreover imposing a necessary
threshold on the minimal activity of the venue to be considered introduce a bias – this way
different fraction of the venues is considered for different commercial categories as those might
have different fractions of smaller venues, which might appear too small for passing the selected
threshold c) finally as the venues offering services represent only one side of the urban system
(commercial offering), one should exercise caution claiming the dynamics in those venues as a
proxy for the growth of the entire urban system. Also while the authors undertake a worthy
effort to discuss biases and limitations of the dataset, it would be a good idea to discuss the bias
related to the possible heterogeneity of Foursquare representativeness across different categories
of customer activity, which might also vary in different geographical areas, being dependent on
cultural habits and preferences of the population.
On the other notice, the second – relative – version of the growth vector (2) does not seem to
make too much sense to me, as it might be heavily affected by the fractions Nnew/Nold which
could become pretty random for a number of smaller commercial categories. Perhaps this is the
reason why meaningful patterns, such as spatial correlation vanish for such a definition.
All said, although I see this is an interesting research with significant merit, some improvements
would be helpful before the paper can be published.

Review of " Tracking Urban Activity Growth Globally with Big Location Data" (RSOS-150688)
11
This paper harnesses large-scale location ("check-in") data from Foursquare to systematically
study the growth of cities across the world in terms of their venues (businesses and other urban
functions). Specifically, it presents a set of new data-driven methods to i) identify different types
cities according to different growth patterns, ii) to identify local hot-spots of growth and iii) to
assess the effect of new venues on existing ones in terms of their popularity.
I very much enjoyed reading the paper and I believe it is a significant contribution to the existing
literature on the growth dynamics of cities. While data from Foursquare certainly has its
limitations (which are properly discussed by the authors), the paper introduces interesting
techniques and case studies that clearly demonstrate the potential of this kind of data for the
quantitative study of cities. As such, I can highly recommend this paper to be published in the
label_version_3
RSOS special issue.
Besides a few typos, I have only a few really minor points that might be addressed when
preparing the final version:
1. In section III. A, the authors write that "Athens shows a blossoming nightlife scene...".
However, as far as I understand from equation 1, Figure 1 shows only relative values. I would
suggest to slightly soften this statement by saying that the nightlife scene is blossoming when
compared to the other categories.
2. In section III. B, second paragraph, I guess the grid size is given in meters?
3. In section IV, the term "transition" in equation 5 was not clear to me. Does a transition
correspond to a check-in to a location? I think it would be helpful if the authors could clarify this
term.

nk you for this suggestion and we understand the reviewers motivation in suggesting this. However, with
greatest possible respect for the reviewers suggestion, the authors would prefer to keep the table
ering as is. Our reasoning is as follows: Table VI shows the top 10 most cooperative categories, with the
est value representing the most cooperative, so it makes sense to list Table VI in descending order.
le IV shows the top 10 most competitive categories, with the lowest value representing the most
perative. Therefore we feel it makes more sense to have the most competitive category (the lowest
e) at the top of the table, and hence to sort the table in descending order.

t of all, the metric being studied, although being relevant, cannot be really interpreted as a
racteristic of urban growth for several reasons: a) it does not address the growth as while new
ues are getting opened all the time, a substantial fraction of the old ones is getting closed,
ch is not addressed by the methodology in any way, so what is measured is rather a
bination of the growth and turnover, rather than purely growth; b) while the number of venues
n important factor, another critical one is their size, which is not considered; moreover
osing a necessary threshold on the minimal activity of the venue to be considered introduce a
s – this way different fraction of the venues is considered for different commercial categories
hose might have different fractions of smaller venues, which might appear too small for
sing the selected threshold c) finally as the venues offering services represent only one side
he urban system (commercial offering), one should exercise caution claiming the dynamics in
se venues as a proxy for the growth of the entire urban system.
nk you for the valuable critique. We’ll address the 3 points separately if we may:
a) This is a totally valid point, and perhaps we are using the term growth too loosely in Secton III.
Unfortunately the dataset does not provide a means of tracking venues that close down and
therefore measuring the net number of new venues opening (or closing) is not possible given the
dataset. Additionally due to the tight time constraints imposed on these revisions, we feel we are
short of the time needed for the substantive rewrite that changing our use of the word growth
throughout the paper would entail. In order to mitigate that this, we have added additional sentences
at the start of Section III.A explaining the limitations of the dataset and how as a result we use the
term <U+200B>growth<U+200B> broadly.
b) This is very true and the issue of bias was raised by Reviewer 1 as well. As mentioned in our
response to Reviewer 1’s comment, we have added a qualification addressing this bias. In regards
to the size of the venues, it is true that this is a very important fact, and any sort of model of urban
growth would undoubtedly have to take size into account. In fact we have performed some further
work exploring this which is not included in this paper. In terms of this paper we have added an
additional paragraph in Section III.A before the clustering analysis, describing a possible alternative
analysis that would take size into account.
c) One of the main advantages of the Foursquare dataset used is that it covers far more than simply
service or commercial venues. For instance in Figure 1 it is possible to see that the dataset contains
many categories outside purely commerical or service categories, such as Residences, Travel and
Transport, Outdoors and Recreation, Events, Offices etc. Therefore we feel that we have
reasonable grounds upon which to assert that we’re measuring something that captures the growth
(subject to the qualifications above) of the majority of the urban system.
o while the authors undertake a worthy effort to discuss biases and limitations of the dataset,
ould be a good idea to discuss the bias related to the possible heterogeneity of Foursquare
resentativeness across different categories of customer activity, which might also vary in
erent geographical areas, being dependent on cultural habits and preferences of the
ulation.
is a very good point and we have added a 3rd paragraph in Section III.A discussing this potential
rce of bias.
the other notice, the second – relative – version of the growth vector (2) does not seem to
ke too much sense to me, as it might be heavily affected by the fractions Nnew/Nold which
ld become pretty random for a number of smaller commercial categories. Perhaps this is the
son why meaningful patterns, such as spatial correlation vanish for such a definition.
nk you for raising this issue. This is indeed a valid concern and this perhaps may be the weakest piece
nalysis in the paper. However the authors hope that the effect described is relatively small, as every city
more than 2,000 venues in and most have between 5,000 and 30,000. As we are only subdividing them
20 categories, we hope that even the small categories will have enough new venues to provide
ningful data. If the submission deadline for revisions wasn’t so tight, we might try and quantify this by
suring the distribution of Nnew and Nold values. However under the time constraints we have had to
le for adding in an acknowledgement of this potential problem into the paper, as well as a form of our
soning above on why we hope the effect is only small.

n section III. A, the authors write that "Athens shows a blossoming nightlife scene...". However,
ar as I understand from equation 1, Figure 1 shows only relative values. I would suggest to
htly soften this statement by saying that the nightlife scene is blossoming when compared to
other categories.
nk you for the suggestion. We have changed it to “<U+200B> can also be seen to be growing rapidly compared to
er categories and cities”<U+200B> .
n section III. B, second paragraph, I guess the grid size is given in meters?
nk you for pointing out that the grid dimensions were very ambiguous. We have changed “<U+200B> divide each
up into a 100x100 grid<U+200B> divide each city up into into 10,000 identically sized regions” <U+200B>
” to “<U+200B> in order to
e our process clearer.
n section IV, the term "transition" in equation 5 was not clear to me. Does a transition
respond to a check­in to a location? I think it would be helpful if the authors could clarify this
m.
transitions referred to were defined back in the start of “Section II : The dataset”. In order to refresh the
der’s memory we have now redefined the term “transition” in Section V and referenced Section II so the
der may return their if desired.

ortunately, as mentioned in our original submission, the Foursquare dataset was provided under an
A. In attempt to explain and mitigate this we have written the following:
Foursquare dataset used in the present work is proprietary and cannot be directly shared by the
hors without permission from Foursquare. However the vast majority of the venue data used in
tion~III can be obtained from the public Foursquare API. Unfortunately, due to changes to the API, the
sition data used in Section~IV cannot be accessed at the time of writing.
ase of interest, readers are welcome to contact the author to discuss approaching Foursquare for

wd­sourced data about points­of­interest and their addition time is available.
hope that this is sufficient, and we have taken Reviewer 2’s comments on board and discussed the API.
