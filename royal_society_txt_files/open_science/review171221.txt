The authors present data on sharing norms, social networks, and sharing behavior in a Saami
reindeer herding community. As the title indicates, they find a “narrow gap” between sharing
norms and actual behavior, with people’s perceptions of cooperation exceeding actual
cooperation, but not by much.
This is a clear and well written manuscript that would make a solid contribution to the literature
on human cooperation. I especially like the petrol allocation task they used to assess generosity
among license-holding reindeer herders. Although this method has been used previously, the
innovation introduced in this paper of endowing participants with a larger sum and allowing
them to donate to as many recipients as they wished was an excellent idea.
Although the manuscript is generally clear, my most important criticism has to do with some lack
of clarity regarding types of norms and the types of data that were collected. As explained in the
second paragraph in the introduction, norms may be descriptive or injunctive (i.e., proscribed or
prescribed). But as the manuscript moves on, I realized that it wasn’t always clear which meaning
of the term was being used. For example, the authors say that “Participants reported a strong
perceived normative belief in reciprocity”. By itself, that makes it sound as if they asked people
about their expectations regarding other people’s behavior and found that they thought that
reciprocating for past help was the (morally?) right thing to do. So that would be an injunctive
norm. But that quote is immediately followed by a colon and then this: “every person we
interviewed said they received advice, help or items from each license owner they reported
helping in turn.” That sounds like a descriptive norm.
I recommend that the authors clarify what exactly they did ask and what conclusions they are
drawing. Is the paper only about descriptive norms, or did they also ask about injunctive norms?
If they did ask about injunctive norms, and if the responses they received are informing their
narrative, then I think that should be acknowledged in the “Materials and Methods” section as an
additional type of data collected.
My other comments are more minor:
(1) Their petrol allocation task reminds me of the Allocation Game developed by Gervais. Here’s
the reference:
Gervais, M.M. (2017). RICH economic games for networked relationships and communities:
Development and preliminary validation in Yasawa, Fiji. Field Methods.
It may not be necessary to cite Gervais’ article, but the authors might be interested in reading it
since it appears that they have independently invented a similar task.
(2) The question of whether behavior in experimental economic games corresponds with
behavior outside the experimental setting is known in that literature as the problem of external
validity. It might be a good idea for the authors to find a way to indicate in their manuscript that
they are aware of that literature and of the relevance of their findings to it.
3
(3) The authors write that “This study provides the first quantification – as far as we are aware –
of the gap between a norm and its associated behaviour.” It’s possible that’s true, but before
making such a claim I think they should examine the rather sizable literature, mostly from social
psychology and sociology, on mismatches between norms and behavior. They cite some of this
literature (citations 9-14), but I’m thinking of a much older literature. Here are a couple of good
sources to check out:
Deutscher, I. 1973. What We Say/What We Do: Sentiments and Acts. Glenview, IL: Scott,
Foresman.
Deutscher, I., et al. 1993. Sentiments and Acts. Hawthorne, NY: Aldine de Gruyter.
Another approach would be to simply insert the word “cooperative” before norm. I’m pretty sure
that would make the claim unassailable, particularly with the “as far as we are aware” caveat.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors present data on sharing norms, social networks, and sharing behavior in a Saami reindeer
herding community. As the title indicates, they find a “narrow gap” between sharing norms and actual
behavior, with people’s perceptions of cooperation exceeding actual cooperation, but not by much.
This is a clear and well written manuscript that would make a solid contribution to the literature on
human cooperation. I especially like the petrol allocation task they used to assess generosity among
license-holding reindeer herders. Although this method has been used previously, the innovation
introduced in this paper of endowing participants with a larger sum and allowing them to donate to as
many recipients as they wished was an excellent idea.
Although the manuscript is generally clear, my most important criticism has to do with some lack of
clarity regarding types of norms and the types of data that were collected. As explained in the second
paragraph in the introduction, norms may be descriptive or injunctive (i.e., proscribed or prescribed).
But as the manuscript moves on, I realized that it wasn’t always clear which meaning of the term was
being used. For example, the authors say that “Participants reported a strong perceived normative belief
in reciprocity”. By itself, that makes it sound as if they asked people about their expectations regarding
other people’s behavior and found that they thought that reciprocating for past help was the (morally?)
right thing to do. So that would be an injunctive norm. But that quote is immediately followed by a colon
and then this: “every person we interviewed said they received advice, help or items from each license
owner they reported helping in turn.” That sounds like a descriptive norm.
I recommend that the authors clarify what exactly they did ask and what conclusions they are drawing.
Is the paper only about descriptive norms, or did they also ask about injunctive norms? If they did ask
about injunctive norms, and if the responses they received are informing their narrative, then I think
that should be acknowledged in the “Materials and Methods” section as an additional type of data
collected.
Response: Our paper is only about descriptive norms and we have now clarified this throughout the
manuscript (e.g. lines 43-44, 78, 252). All the data we used for our analyses has been reported in the
manuscript; we did not include other responses as an additional type of data.
My other comments are more minor:
(1) Their petrol allocation task reminds me of the Allocation Game developed by Gervais. Here’s the
reference:
Gervais, M.M. (2017). RICH economic games for networked relationships and communities:
Development and preliminary validation in Yasawa, Fiji. Field Methods.
It may not be necessary to cite Gervais’ article, but the authors might be interested in reading it since it
appears that they have independently invented a similar task.
Response: We are aware of Gervais’s allocation game, although we did not cite it because his game
differed from ours in significant ways. Participants in Gervais’s game were allowed to keep part of their
endowments for themselves whereas in our version (and the others we cited), participants had to give
everything away; in addition, participants were presented with photographs of their social networks and
were only allowed to allocate money to men. Thus, we argue that behaviour in Gervais’s game and ours
are not easily comparable.
(2) The question of whether behavior in experimental economic games corresponds with behavior
outside the experimental setting is known in that literature as the problem of external validity. It might
be a good idea for the authors to find a way to indicate in their manuscript that they are aware of that
literature and of the relevance of their findings to it.
Response: The question of external validity is a very important one and we thank the reviewer for
highlighting it. Our aim in using petrol as the currency in our experimental game was to achieve external
validity (and is something we have done in our previous studies: see Thomas et al. 2015, 2016), since
participants were making allocation decisions based on a commodity that is important in a reindeer
herding lifestyle. We have now added a statement to this effect in Methods and cited papers by Levitt,
List and Winking in this area (lines 138-142).

public goods experiment. Hum. Ecol. 44 633–642. (doi:10.1007/s10745-016-9848-3)
(3) The authors write that “This study provides the first quantification – as far as we are aware – of the
gap between a norm and its associated behaviour.” It’s possible that’s true, but before making such a
claim I think they should examine the rather sizable literature, mostly from social psychology and

Another approach would be to simply insert the word “cooperative” before norm. I’m pretty sure that
would make the claim unassailable, particularly with the “as far as we are aware” caveat.
Response: Thank you for pointing us towards Deutscher’s work in this area. We have now added
‘cooperative’ before ‘norm’ as suggested (line 313).

Comments to the Author(s)
Good data, great research practices, well explained. I recommend publication with only a few
clarifications and suggestions:
1. I understand that H1 probably came from your pilot analysis, but I don't follow why you would
theoretically expect the mismatch?
Response: H1 comes from the literature we cited in the introduction showing that there are often
differences between (cooperative) norms and ensuing behaviour. We have now added a note to H1 to
that effect (line 84).
2. For clarity in reading, it might be good to list the hypotheses and the theory behind them in a
numbered list rather than in the text.
Response: We have changed this to a numbered list (lines 84-99).
3. Similarly, it would be useful to list the findings more clearly in the results and/or discussion.
Response: We have highlighted which hypothesis each finding refers to in the results section (lines 218,
222, 224, 237, 250).
