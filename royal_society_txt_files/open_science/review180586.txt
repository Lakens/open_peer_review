Adsorption of organic matter on/within low pressure membrane plays an important role in
membrane fouling, especially irreversible fouling. In this study, the amount and structure of
EfOM deposition on PVDF films containing different amount of additives was monitored using
QCM-D, and interaction force between EfOM and membranes during different stages of filtration
was determined by AFM. The topic is meaningful and interesting, and the manuscript is well
structured. I think the manuscript fits the journal’s requirements, but there are some points that
can be further improved. Therefore, I recommend the acceptance of this paper after a moderate
revision.
Suggestions:
1) In Section 4.5, membranes after filtration of 800 mL secondary effluent were used to evaluate
the adhesion force between EfOM molecules, and concluded interaction forces between EfOM
molecules were affected by surface properties of membrane. However, as shown in section 4.2
and 4.3, the amounts of EfOM deposition on these three kinds of membranes were different,
which meant that surface coverage of membrane by EfOM was different. Therefore, part of the
determined adhesion forces might be interactions between EfOM and membrane, not those
between EfOM molecules.
2) As demonstrated in section 4.3, more EfOM was adsorbed on M1. Moreover, average pore size
of M1 was much smaller than M3. Therefore, the amount of EfOM deposited on/within M1
would be higher than that on/within M3. To further elucidate the variation of foulant layer, it is
suggested that the fouling resistance normalized by DOC deposition on/within membrane could
be calculated.
3) How the surface properties of membrane and adhesion forces between EfOM and membrane
exerted influence on interaction forces between EfOM molecules and the structure of foulant
layer? The possible mechanisms should be further elucidated.
4) Page 3, Line 40, check if the diameter of the PVDF microsphere was 5 mm.
5) There are many grammar errors and the language should be improved further, for example:
Page 1, Line 26: ‘membrane blend with …’;

Page 1, Line 42, ‘poor hydrophobic properties’;

Adsorption of organic matter on/within low pressure membrane plays an
important role in membrane fouling, especially irreversible fouling. In this study,
the amount and structure of EfOM deposition on PVDF films containing
different amount of additives was monitored using QCM-D, and interaction
force between EfOM and membranes during different stages of filtration was
determined by AFM. The topic is meaningful and interesting, and the manuscript
is well structured. I think the manuscript fits the journal’s requirements, but there
are some points that can be further improved. Therefore, I recommend the
acceptance of this paper after a moderate revision.
Suggestions:
1) In Section 4.5, membranes after filtration of 800 mL secondary effluent
were used to evaluate the adhesion force between EfOM molecules, and
concluded interaction forces between EfOM molecules were affected by surface
properties of membrane. However, as shown in section 4.2 and 4.3, the amounts
of EfOM deposition on these three kinds of membranes were different, which
meant that surface coverage of membrane by EfOM was different. Therefore,
part of the determined adhesion forces might be interactions between EfOM and
membrane, not those between EfOM molecules.
The authors’ Answer: Thank you for your careful examination of our paper.
We agree with your opinion that the interactions between EfOM and membrane
played a dominant role in the filtration process. Our Previous research [Wang L,
Miao R, Wang X, et al. Environmental Science & Technology, 2013, 47(8):3708-3714.]
found that in the initial stage of filtration, foulant was rapidly adsorbed and
accumulated onto the membrane surface, which was controlled mainly by the
foulant-membrane interaction, and in the later stage of filtration was controlled
mainly by the foulant-foulant interaction. In this study, we found that the
relationship between foulant and foulant is also affected by the interaction
between membrane and foulant (EfOM), and it’s mainly because of the water
film was formed on the membrane surface, which could effectively prevent
interaction between EfOM and the membrane surface, thereby effectively
reduces the interaction between EfOM and EfOM . Therefore, we think that the
adhesion in the adsorption process is mainly affected by the interaction between
membrane and EfOM, the stronger the hydrophilicity of membrane surface, the
weaker the interaction of membrane-foulant, and the weaker the interaction of
foulant-foulant.
2) As demonstrated in section 4.3, more EfOM was adsorbed on M1. Moreover,
average pore size of M1 was much smaller than M3. Therefore, the amount of
EfOM deposited on/within M1 would be higher than that on/within M3. To
further elucidate the variation of foulant layer, it is suggested that the fouling
resistance normalized by DOC deposition on/within membrane could be
calculated.
The authors’ Answer: Thank you for your careful examination of our paper. On
the one hand, the use of quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring
(QCM-D) to characterize the variation of foulant layer on the membrane surface
is an effective method and it is widely used. For example, Ying et al. [Ying W,
Yang F, Bick A, et al. Environmental Science & Technology, 2010, 44(22):8636-8643.] study
on the viscoelasticity of Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) foulant layer
on membrane surface by QCM-D; Sweity et al. [Sweity A, Ying W, Ali-Shtayeh M S, et
al. Water Research, 2011, 45(19):6430-6440; Sweity A, Wang Y, Belfer S, et al. Journal of
Membrane Science, 2011, 378(1–2):186-193.] also studied on the adherence,
viscoelastic properties of EPS in the membrane bioreactor using QCM-D. Miao
et al. [Miao R, Wang L, Mi N, et al. Environmental Science & Technology, 2015,
49(11):6574-6580.] used QCM-D combined with a PVDF coated sensor crystal to
investigate the effect of ionic strength on the deposition and adsorption behavior
of BSA on the PVDF surface and the structure of the BSA adsorption layers. On
the other hand, In section 4.3, because of the foulant layer which deposition
on/within the QCM-D sensor coated with M1-M3 membrane was extremely thin
(only a few tens of nanometer), when we measured DOC, it is very difficult to
determine whether the foulant layer can be completely removed from the M1–M3
membrane surface, thus causing great errors in the determination of DOC, so we
did not use this characterization method. In the future, we will further improve
the relevant methods.
3) How the surface properties of membrane and adhesion forces between EfOM
and membrane exerted influence on interaction forces between EfOM molecules
and the structure of foulant layer? The possible mechanisms should be further
elucidated.
The authors’ Answer: Thank you for your careful examination of our paper. As
shown in figure 4(b). SiO2 particles are rich in hydroxyl groups, which are very
easily combined with water molecules. With the increase in SiO2 content, a
dense hydrated layer was formed, which could effectively inhibit the initial
accumulation of EfOM onto the membrane surface. The conformation of EfOM
was not easily distorted upon interaction with the modified membrane surface.
Water molecules penetrated into the adsorption layer gradually, accompanied by
the EfOM adsorption process, so the conformation of the foulant layer became
loose. The presence of water molecules can make the adsorption layer loose, and
can also effectively reduce the contact between EfOM and EfOM, as well as
between EfOM and membrane, thus the adhesion force will become smaller.

The authors’ Answer: Thank you for your careful examination of our paper. I
have corrected this mistake. The diameter of the PVDF microsphere was 5 µm.
Please see the revised manuscript in Page 3, Line 39.
5) There are many grammar errors and the language should be improved further,
for example:
