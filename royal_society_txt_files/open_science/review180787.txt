The authors improved Anti-infrared Radiation and Heat-insulation of composite aerogel by
adding PTW. The work is interesting and can be publish in this journal if the following issues are
addressed:
1. In the Thermal conductivity analysis section, Paragraph 1 and 2 should be moved to the
Introduction. These paragraphs review on thermal conductivity of material.
2. Why choose the molar ration of Al and Si is 1:9.
3. What difference between FI-IR results of modified PTW dosing samples and PTW doped
composite aerogel (Figure 1 and 2).
4. What about xerogel particle size? The SEM results did not clearly show the difference of
xerogel particle size as authors mentioned. The authors should add SEM results with higher
magnification to prove the discussion.
5. Shrinkage of gel can be prove by porosity of samples. Porosity can be calculate by density. The
authors should add these results and combine with SEM to prove your discussion on structure of
composite aerogel.

Appendix A
Dear referees:
First of all, please accept my apology for giving you a reply after such a long
time. Due to the occupancy of the test equipment, the re-test of the sample's
SEM results has delayed some time.
It is my honor that you can read this article patiently during your busy schedule
and I am really appreciated for your recognition of this article. Besides, thank
you for providing these instructive suggestions which do a lot of help to the
further improvement of the article. I have carefully considered the issues you
addressed and have revised them one by one in this article. The specific
modifications are shown in Annex I on the following pages.
Thank you again for your suggestions. I hope the answers and modifications I
give are valid and appropriate. If there is any other issue or suggestion, please do
not hesitate to let me know and I am willing to provide the further modifications.

Manuscript ID: RSOS-180787
Title: Improving Anti-infrared Radiation and Heat-insulation by PTW-doped
Al2O3-SiO2 Composite Xerogel
Point-by-Point Responses:
Reviewer 1
Comments: The authors improved Anti-infrared Radiation and Heat-insulation of
composite aerogel by adding PTW. The work is interesting and can be publish in this
journal if the following issues are addressed.
Comments:
1. In the Thermal conductivity analysis section, Paragraph 1 and 2 should
be moved to the Introduction. These paragraphs review on thermal
conductivity of material.
Respond: After carefully considering your suggestion here, I agree that it is
more reasonable to put the first and second paragraph of the Thermal
conductivity analysis section into the Introduction. (For the detailed revised
content, please check on page 1-2 of the paper which I have highlighted with the
red font.)
2. Why choose the molar ration of Al and Si is 1:9.
Respond: I am sorry for not clearly stating the reasons for this molar ratio in the
paper because of the wrong consideration about the conciseness, here we accept
your comment to supplement the reason for choosing this ratio in our paper. And
for the better logicality, we change the properly the expounding order of thermal
conductivity analysis and infrared radiation blocking performance analysis. (For
the detailed revised content, please check on page 4, 5 and 7 of this paper which
I have highlighted with the red font.) For your convenience, here I have
summarized the reason below:
In order to investigate what difference in its thermal conductivity will be made
by adding different amount of Al2O3 into the composite gel, two other samples
adding the Al to Si molar ratio as 2:8 and 3:7 with 5wt% modified PTW have
been prepared in the laboratory(sample VI and VII), and their thermal
conductivities were measured after drying at 100 <U+2103> for one hour(Same
processing conditions as sample III) ,which is higher compared with the
experimental sample III.

VI 2:8 5 0.4369 0.14 0.0612
VII 3:7 5 0.4399 0.12 0.0639
Considering that the increasing amount of Al increases the thermal conductivity
instead of improving the thermal insulating property of the samples, we choose
the most appropriate Al to Si molar ratio as 1:9 with the lowest thermal
conductivity.
3. What difference between FI-IR results of modified PTW dosing
samples and PTW doped composite aerogel (Figure 1 and 2).
Respond: I am really sorry that our unclearly expression in this section has
caused such doubts. Here I further explain: Fig.1 and Fig.2 are showed in this
paper not for comparison. They both show the samples in the infrared spectrum
to analyze functional group structures. (For the detailed revised content, please
check on page 4, Paragraph 1 and 2 in the section “Infrared analysis of new
composite materials” of this paper which I have highlighted with the red font.)
For convenience, here I have summarized the reasons why we present these two
figures with no particular differences below:
In order to intuitively compare infrared contrastive spectrums of these four
samples with different amount of modified PTW at room temperature: II, III, IV,
and V, we put all curves on one image (Fig.1) to clearly reveal that the four
samples show the same peak positions, which indicates that the different doping
amount of PTW brought no difference to main compositions of the final products
prepared. And we take the sample prepared with a modified PTW doping amount
of 5wt% (sample III) as an example individually on Fig.2 to specifically analyze
the structures and functional groups of the new composite material.
4. What about xerogel particle size? The SEM results did not clearly show
the difference of xerogel particle size as authors mentioned. The authors
should add SEM results with higher magnification to prove the discussion.
Respond: I am pretty sorry for not providing the suitable SEM results and
giving an unclear description and discussion about the products of experimental
research due to the poor testing techniques and the inappropriate selection of the
SEM results. We have offered more appropriate SEM results and discussions in
the revised paper after re-testing the samples. The highest SEM results provided
in the revision are magnified by 50.0K times. (For the detailed revised content,
please check on page 4-5, in the section “Electron microscopic analysis for
surface microstructures of new composites” of this paper which we have
highlighted with the red font.) The specific amendments and SEM results are
offered as follows:
First of all, it can be seen from the images that the particle size of the
experimentally-prepared xerogel samples are nanometer-scale which means the
xerogel is composed by nano-micro particles. According to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the
partial aggregation of the particles becomes more apparent and the particle size
of the agglomerated particles becomes larger by adding Al2O3, and the voids
between the agglomerated particles are also reduced. When the adding PTW is
not too much, according to Fig. 3, the particle size of the agglomerated particles
is getting bigger and the voids between the agglomerated particles are further
reduced. While with the increased doping amount of PTW, according to Fig. 4
and Fig. 5, what can be seen clearly is that though the particle size is getting
bigger, the voids become larger which could indicate that the compactness of the
samples is seriously damaged.

Fig.3 Electron microscope image of sample III

Fig.5 Electron microscope image of sample V
5. Shrinkage of gel can be proved by porosity of samples. Porosity can be
calculate by density. The authors should add these results and combine with
SEM to prove your discussion on structure of composite aerogel.
Respond: Thank you for your suggestion here and it is necessary for us to
apologize that we realized the improper analysis about the porosity previously
due to improper selection and misunderstanding of the SEM results after
re-testing the microstructure of the samples. We have put the clearer results and
revised the discussion in this section about microscopic structures of xerogel we
prepared. (For the detailed revised content, please check on page 4, 5 and 7 of
this paper which we have highlighted in the red font.)The specific amendments
are summarized as follows:
As can be seen obviously from Fig.1, silica xerogel exhibits certain shrinkage on
the surface due to the preparing method and conditions. After adding Al2O3, we
can see from Fig.2 that the shrinkage of sample II has reduced comparing with
Fig.1. As Fig.3 shows, the shrinkage is further reduced and the structure of the
sample III is relatively dense and the whiskers are faintly visible. According to
Fig.4 and 5, with the increasing amount of PTW in the xerogel, the compactness
of the samples is seriously damaged which finally affect the related properties of
samples. The reason probably is that the size of PTW particles which can be seen
as long strips in Fig.3,4 and 5 is uneven and much larger than that of the silica
particles .

6. How to compare particle size of PTW and SiO2 with no data. Should
add these data to clarify.
Respond: Following your comment, we have added the particular images for the
particle size of PTW and SiO2 in the revision to clarify the comparison. (For the
detailed revised content, please check on the top of page 5 of this paper which I
have highlighted in the red font.) For convenience, here I have summarized
corresponding analysis below:
According Fig.6, the PTW prepared is small, 0.5-1.5µm in diameter and 30-50µm
in length. As can be seen from Fig.7, the particle size of SiO2 is nanometer-sized
which is much smaller than the former.

Fig.7 Electron microscope image of SiO2
7. Why adding PTW lead to reduce thermal conductivity of composite
aerogel. What is the thermal conductivity value of PTW.
Respond: Thank you for your suggestion here. After a careful consideration, we
have made a supplement in the paper about the thermal conductivity value of
PTW and its thermal conductivity is 5.4 W/(m.K) at room temperature. (For the
detailed revised content, please check paragraph 1 on page 1 of this paper
which I have highlighted in the red font.)
Here is the reason for the reduction on thermal conductivity of composite aerogel
by adding PTW: Due to the high infrared reflectivity of PTW, with the
appropriate increasing incorporation of PTW, the total thermal conductivity of
the composite xerogel decreases owing to the decrease of the radiant thermal
conductivity which is benefit from PTW.
8. English writing need to be improved.
Respond: Thank you for your suggestion. I am really ashamed if my poor
English writing level has caused any inconvenience for your reading. I have tried
my best to weigh and modify the wording of the paper again and I really hope
that I have made some progress. If there is still any inappropriate wording,
please do not hesitate to let me know. Thank you again for your patience and
kind advice.
