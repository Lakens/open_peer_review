In this paper Carucci et al attempt to determine how different neural progenitors respond
differentially to the same extrinsic signals (retinoic acid). The motivation behind the study is to
understand how RA can drive context-specific effects on neural cells (both the timing and
position of a cell along the neuraxis will affect how it responds to RA). The authors are interested
in the molecular mechanism that explains how forebrain progenitors lose their competency to
become posteriorized by RA.
To answer this question, the authors use the in vitro culture of isolated neural stem cells
from13.5dpc mouse embryos. The use populations of neural stem cells from the anterior nervous
system and the hindbrain/spinal cord to assess the ability of different rostrocaudal neural
progenitors to induce Hoxb genes, which are well-characterised targets of RA during A-P
patterning. They examine Hoxb4-6 (characteristic of the posterior hindbrain/brachial spinal cord
region).
The authors demonstrate that although anterior and posterior neural stem cells respond to RA
signalling (based on a luciferase reporter), only the caudal cells induce HoxB genes. Likewise,
treatment with RA elevates the expression of these genes in caudal but not rostral cells. The
authors demonstate with ChIP analyses that rostral neural cells have a higher enrichment for the
repressive histone mark H3K27me3 at known HoxB enhancers, and other genomic regions
nearby, whereas caudal progenitors have a higher enrichment for activation marks H3K4me3 and
H3K9/14ac.
Major points:
As this is a study centred around Hox identity, it is important to better clarify the precise AP
positions used to derive rostral and caudal cell types from mouse embryos.
It is unclear what proportion of cells are responding to the RA treatment. Similarly, what
transfection efficiency was observed in this population-based assay?
It is unclear why gene expression analyses were conducted 24hrs after the time point at which RA
signalling was observed. A time course to examine when RA signalling is peaking in these cells
would have been useful to determine when to examine the readout of RA at the level of Hox
genes - particularly as the activation of different Hox genes depends on timing.
The induction of other Hox clusters should have been examined, to have a better understanding
of the AP identity of the cells with/without RA. It seems as though the neural cells being isolated
are brachial spinal cord and the treatment with RA is not altering their AP identity. Therefore,
even caudal progenitors are not changing their AP identity. Is that correct?
Histone marks that were assayed correlate with the fact that there are differences in gene
expression levels between rostral and caudal progenitors - they do not explain the differences.
The direct relevance of each genomic region examined is not fully explored. The authors should
be careful not to over-interpret the data. In particular the title implies causation not just
correlation. In addition, the last line of the Abstract, “These results suggest that the response of
NSPCs to morphogen signalling across the rostrocaudal axis of the neural tube is gated by the
epigenetic configuration of target patterning genes…” also implies causation.

We thank the Editor for the positive assessment of our manuscript. As suggested by
the Editor, we show in our response to the Reviewers' comments below some in-hand
data that are useful to address some of the issues raised by Reviewer 1. While these
results support the experimental work reported in the manuscript, they are based on a
more limited number of experimental replicates than the data reported in the Dryad
repository. For this reason, we would prefer not to include them in the published
dataset, unless requested by the Editor. In addition, we have revised the manuscript
text according to the Reviewer's suggestions.

We thank the Reviewer for the careful and constructive review of our manuscript. We
provide below additional unpublished evidences in support of the experimental work
described in the manuscript. We have also revised the manuscript text and cited
additional literature to clarify the issues raised by the Reviewer.
Major points:
the precise AP positions used to derive rostral and caudal cell types from mouse
embryos.
Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) used for this work were already described in
previous publications [1]. Nonetheless, as requested by the Reviewer, we have added
a more detailed description of the derivation of rostral and caudal NSPCs in the
Materials and Methods section of this manuscript.
Briefly, rostral (cortex) NSPCs were derived from the dorsolateral wall of the
E13.5 telencephalon, corresponding to the developing cerebral cortex, excluding both
the hippocampus (medially) and the ganglionic eminences (ventrally). Caudal (spinal
cord) NSPCs were derived from E13.5 spinal cord tissue dissected between the
hindbrain/spinal cord boundary [2] and hindlimb buds.
It is unclear what proportion of cells are responding to the RA treatment.
Similarly, what transfection efficiency was observed in this population-based
assay?
We transfected NSPCs with Amaxa Nucleofector kits (http://www.lonza.com), which
provide high transfection efficiency. Previously published work performed in the
authors' labs report a transfection efficiency of approximately 80% in the NSPC
culture system used for this manuscript [3][4]. Therefore, data shown in Fig. 1
suggest that, when activation of a RA-responsive reporter is compared between rostral
and caudal NSPCs, mean activation levels measured across the majority of cultured
cells are similar in rostral and caudal samples. As pointed out by the reviewer, we
cannot rule out differences in the proportion of RA-responsive NSPCs in rostral and
caudal cultures, even though they show similar average responses when whole
populations are compared. We have added a sentence in the manuscript Discussion to
clarify this issue.
It is unclear why gene expression analyses were conducted 24hrs after the time
point at which RA signalling was observed. A time course to examine when RA
signalling is peaking in these cells would have been useful to determine when to
examine the readout of RA at the level of Hox genes - particularly as the
activation of different Hox genes depends on timing.
A recent study [5] has described a detailed time course of Hox gene upregulation by
exogenous RA in mouse embryonic stem cells differentiating to neuroectoderm. In
the case of Hoxb genes, peak expression levels were reached after 36 hours of
treatment, which is close to the 48 hours time window used in our assays. Although
we did not carry out a systematic analysis as that of De Kumar et al., we performed
pilot experiments indicating that the 48 hours time point is suitable to detect maximal
upregulation of our genes of interest.
For example, the charts below show real-time PCR quantification of the expression
levels of RA-inducible genes (Rarb and Dhrs3) in rostral NSPCs that were treated
with DMSO or RA for 32 or 48 hours. Data are normalized to expression levels in
E13.5 spinal cord (SC) tissue and represented as Log10 of this ratio. Rarb levels are
similar in the two treatment conditions, while Dhrs3 shows slightly increased
expression at the 48 hours time point.

The following charts show the effects of prolonged (3-4 cell culture passages,
corresponding to approximately 10 days) RA treatments, in comparison with 48 hours
treatments, on the expression levels of RA-responsive genes (Rarb, Dhrs3, Cyp26a1)
and Hoxb genes in caudal NSPCs. RA pathway activation (as assessed based on the
expression levels of Rarb, Dhrs3 and Cyp26a1) does not noticeably increase during
treatments longer than 48 hours. Overall expression levels of Hoxb genes also remain
similar during prolonged treatments, although there might be a slight shift towards
more caudal Hoxb profiles (as suggested by a limited decrease of Hoxb4 RA/DMSO
ratio and a limited increase of Hoxb9 RA/DMSO ratio in the extended treatment
condition, in comparison with the 48 hours time point).

Altogether, these results suggest that maximal levels of RA pathway activation are
reached close to the 48 hours time point and that longer treatment conditions do not
lead to major changes in the expression profiles of Hoxb genes in comparison with 48
hours treatments.
In the case of the luciferase reporter assays shown in Fig.1A and 1D, we chose to
analyse the samples after 24 hours of RA treatment (corresponding to 48 hours post-
transfection), since expression levels of episomal plasmids in NSPCs peak 48 hours
after transfection and are likely to decline afterwards (www.lonza.com).
The induction of other Hox clusters should have been examined, to have a better
the neural cells being isolated are brachial spinal cord and the treatment with
RA is not altering their AP identity. Therefore, even caudal progenitors are not
changing their AP identity. Is that correct?
For this study, we have focused on the regulation of Hoxb genes, because, among Hox
clusters, they show the strongest response to retinoid signalling in the developing
mouse neural tube [6][7]. Furthermore, key RAREs mediating RA-dependent
regulation of these genes in the neural tube have been extensively characterised and
one of them (known as DE-RARE) is specific to the Hoxb cluster, explaining the
stronger response of Hoxb genes to RA in neural tube cells [6]. As suggested by the
Reviewer, expression of Hoxb4-9 genes in spinal cord NSPCs is consistent with a
brachial spinal cord identity [6][7], but we cannot exclude coexistence of more caudal
identities, since spinal cord fragments used for NSPC derivation included a broad
region extending to the level of hindlimb buds. While this work was mainly focused
on the comparison between rostral (cortex) and caudal (spinal cord) NSPCs, in future
studies it would be interesting to investigate whether NSPCs derived from different
levels of the posterior neural tube can maintain region-specific identities in vitro and
whether their positional identity can be modulated by RA or other morphogens.
As explained above, we chose to focus on Hoxb cluster due to its strong response
to retinoid signalling in neural tube cells in vivo. As a first step to compare the effects
of retinoid signalling on Hoxb genes with those on other Hox clusters in vitro, we
tested the expression of Hoxa4 in control and RA-treated caudal NSPCs. These data
are shown in the chart below, where Hoxa4 expression levels in NSPCs and in E13.5
spinal cord tissue are normalized to expression levels in E13.5 hindbrain (HB) tissue
(data are represented as Log10 of this ratio). In this analysis, it is interesting to see that
Hoxa4 expression levels are comparable in caudal NSPC cultures and in spinal cord
tissue, but in both cases they are clearly lower than the expression levels of this gene
in hindbrain (HB) tissue. Although Hoxa4 is significantly upregulated in RA-treated
NSPCs in comparison with DMSO-treated samples, the relative Hoxa4 increase is
nearly half of that displayed by Hoxb4 (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that spinal
cord identity is maintained in RA-treated caudal NSPCs, and that differences in RA-
responsiveness of distinct Hox clusters in neural tube cells in vivo might be
reproducible in NSPCs in vitro. In future work, it will be interesting to compare RA-
dependent responses of different Hox clusters in caudal NSPCs in more detail.

Histone marks that were assayed correlate with the fact that there are
differences in gene expression levels between rostral and caudal progenitors -
they do not explain the differences. The direct relevance of each genomic region
interpret the data. In particular the title implies causation not just correlation.
In addition, the last line of the Abstract, “These results suggest that the response
of NSPCs to morphogen signalling across the rostrocaudal axis of the neural
tube is gated by the epigenetic configuration of target patterning genes…” also
implies causation.
We agree with the Reviewer that our results suggest a correlation between the
epigenetic signatures of rostral and caudal NSPCs and their different responses to RA,
but they do not yet demonstrate a causative link. According to the Reviewer's
recommendation, we have modified the manuscript title and the manuscript text to
tone down speculations on the role played by the analysed histone marks in
controlling NSPC responsiveness to retinoid signalling.

I read this paper with interest. It provides support for the use of in vitro model
systems to potential mirror in vivo responses to RA and perhaps other signally
pathways, and show underlying chromatin marks consistent with those
expression responses. Future experiments exploiting these to determine
mechanistic causes and consequences and confirmation of these back to in vivo
context will be important.
We thank the Reviewer for the positive evaluation of our manuscript. We hope that
this work will represent a useful reference for future functional studies investigating
the epigenetic mechanisms controlling maintenance of positional identities in NSPCs.
