Major Comment:
I did not notice this in a previous work by the authors, but in the kind of regression that seems to
be employed here, Equation (1) has unit vector predictors and a unit vector prediction, which is
not mathematically possible with ordinary statistical methods. I.e., even though you can calculate
residuals between the left and right hand sides of the equation, and then choose beta to minimize
the square residuals, normal error (not shown in Eq. 1) will not maintain the normalized property
of the unit vectors and the distribution of predictions is not actually a distribution of unit vectors.
This is definitely a problem, though it is not clear to me how much of an effect it might have on
the results (and perhaps fixing it might even improve the results), as the unit vectors analyzed
should be correlated, which this analysis does get at. I think the easiest way to fix this might be to
switch to an AR(1) like model in the turn angles, possibly with link functions from circular
statistics like tangent/arctangent. I have never used it, but there appear to be some relevant
methods and references in the R package circular.
I suspect that this issue can be fixed without excess effort by the authors, and the results will
likely hold for the most part, though it would definitely constitute a major revision.
Minor Comments:
Was it not possible to marginalize over the missing locations? Interpolation will (I think)
necessarily inflate both sample size and the lag term in Eq. (1). As an aside, this kind of
marginalization is very easy if you construct a linear model, like an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
for the velocity. I think Devin Johnson has had a paper or two recently related to this. Also, this
avoids the normalization issue pointed out above, though it is probably far too much work at this
stage of this manuscript.
Why is there no proportionality constant on rank in Eq. (2).

This paper studies the influences that individuals exert on each other during foraging movements
in a troop of baboon. The analysis is based on a movement kinetic model where each group
member is attracted (or repelled) in the direction of others, through an interaction matrix. The
results reveal heterogeneous patterns of interactions, which are correlated to social rank, but not
exclusively. A network analysis shows that a relatively large number of individual form a core
which strongly influences the movements of the group, the other individual being more
peripherical. This result, among others presented in the paper, is an interesting one, as it shows
that movement may produce or reveal unexpected structures in social groups, even those with
despotic structure. The core of more influent individuals could be used by the group as a
distributed knowledge regarding the location of resources, for instance.
The paper is clearly written and presents an original methodology to disentangle social structure
and collective movement. It is a valuable contribution to the field. There are a few aspects below
that could be clarified.
-The interaction coefficients beta_i,j do not depend on the separation distance between
individuals i and j. In a spread out group, the effect of distances may be important. In bird flocks,
a interaction radius is often considered in models. A justification for not taking the distance into
account should be given.
-Eq (2) seems to be a fit which is tested on the calculated beta_i,j rather than an assumption in the
model, but this is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore this equation is a bit confusing. In addition
the variable g_i is not explained (is it a propensity of individual i to follow others or the center of
mass?), and more general fits could also be proposed, for instance beta_i,j=c_i(Drank_i,j)+g_i, as
it is not obvious that beta_i,j should be a linear function of the rank difference with refactor 1.
-Little is said in the methods on how the rank of each individual was estimated in the group.
-The three-layer structure found looks a bit subtle for a network composed of only 14 nodes. How
reliable is this extra-core composed of 2 individuals, in-between the core and the periphery?
Couldn't these nodes be incorporated to one of the two other components? If it is real, what could
explain the presence of three layers and what could be a possible function of such structure?
Similarly, the presence of a low ranking female in the core could indicate a special role for this
individual, or be a consequence of the limitation of the method exposed on page 8.

I only have some minor comments remaining:
I think it should be better mentioned in the main text surrounding eqn. 1 that the x and y
components can't actually be independent (once you pin down one component of a unit vector,
the other component can only take 2 possible values), and then I would reference the new circular
statistics material in the appendix.

I would also check through simulation if your standard errors behind the coefficient CIs need to
be increased by a factor of approximately sqrt(2) as a correction for counting both the x & y
components as independent data. Alternatively, I suppose you could use something like a
parametric bootstrap to generate the CIs. I'm not familiar with the packages you used to run the
analysis, but if they do something like a bootstrap yet simulate independent x & y components,
then that wouldn't correct for the non-independence.

Major Comment:
I did not notice this in a previous work by the authors, but in the kind of regression that
seems to be employed here, Equation (1) has unit vector predictors and a unit vector
prediction, which is not mathematically possible with ordinary statistical methods. I.e., even
though you can calculate residuals between the left and right hand sides of the equation, and
then choose beta to minimize the square residuals, normal error (not shown in Eq. 1) will not
maintain the normalized property of the unit vectors and the distribution of predictions is not
actually a distribution of unit vectors.
This is definitely a problem, though it is not clear to me how much of an effect it might have
on the results (and perhaps fixing it might even improve the results), as the unit vectors
analyzed should be correlated, which this analysis does get at. I think the easiest way to fix
this might be to switch to an AR(1) like model in the turn angles, possibly with link functions
from circular statistics like tangent/arctangent. I have never used it, but there appear to be
some relevant methods and references in the R package circular.
I suspect that this issue can be fixed without excess effort by the authors, and the results will
likely hold for the most part, though it would definitely constitute a major revision.
We have altered our method to incorporate unit vectors directly, using the arctangent as a link function
(viz, atan2). We follow Rivest et al. (2016) and use RStan to do the calculations. As Dr Fleming
predicted, the results remain qualitatively the same. That is, the estimated individuals forming the core
are the same, and this is largely true for the periphery structure as well. We also obtain a similar effect
of rank difference on movement bias, although the proportion of variation explained by rank difference
decreased.
When we applied these new methods to the simulated data, however, in which we know the correct
underlying structure, we found that, although the results remained qualitatively similar, the estimates
were more variable around the true structures. Consequently, we find ourselves in a situation where
each method (i.e., linear vs circular) generates qualitatively similar outcomes (other than a drop in
explained variance), but where simulations suggest that the original method, while perhaps not as
analytically 'kosher', is more likely to be capturing the true underlying structure.
To be clear, the original method made the assumption that individual motion in x and y were
independent, producing a matrix in which each observation contributed two rows of data (one in the x
and y dimensions). Under this assumption, it was then possible to take a linear regression approach to
estimating beta values. The production of two rows of data (x,y) for each observation might be seen as
a disadvantage of this approach.
Treating each observation within a circular framework alleviates this disadvantage and allows for each
observation to take into account both x, y dimensions simultaneously. Theoretically, this method then
seems to be superior to the original linear method. However, given our results from testing both
methods on our simulated dataset, we are left with a choice of leading with either the more theoretically
sound approach or the one that produces lower errors from the simulated data.
We are happy to go either way, and leave it up to the reviewers and editor as to which to include in the
main document. In the current submission, we present the original method in the main text, but provide
results from both methods on the simulated data (Supp. A), as well as the results of the observed data
using the circular methods (Supp. B) in supplementary sections.

Minor Comments:
Was it not possible to marginalize over the missing locations? Interpolation will (I think)
necessarily inflate both sample size and the lag term in Eq. (1). As an aside, this kind of
marginalization is very easy if you construct a linear model, like an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process for the velocity. I think Devin Johnson has had a paper or two recently related to this.
Also, this avoids the normalization issue pointed out above, though it is probably far too
much work at this stage of this manuscript.
The recent paper by Devin Johnson is an interesting read! We agree that using the methods proposed in
Johnson et al. 2008 might be too much at this stage. It is important to note that interpolation was only
used to estimate the location of group mates, not the focal animal. In this regard, only the observed
locations of the focal were used as dependent variables, so as to not inflate sample size or the lag term.
We have clarified this in the paper:
“Given that the positions of individuals were not recorded concurrently, the positions of all other group
members at any one given observation for a focal animal were estimated by linear interpolation between
subsequent observations of group members. Using this approach interpolation was used only to estimate
the positions of other group members, whereas the positions of the focal animal was based solely on our
actual observations.”
Why is there no proportionality constant on rank in Eq. (2).
We have added in the proportionality term for the effect of rank on influence, the equation now reads:
<U+3016> ß<U+3017>_(i,j)=<U+3016><U+3016> ß<U+3017>_r <U+2206>rank<U+3017>_(i,j)+g_i eq.2

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper studies the influences that individuals exert on each other during foraging
movements in a troop of baboon. The analysis is based on a movement kinetic model where
each group member is attracted (or repelled) in the direction of others, through an
interaction matrix. The results reveal heterogeneous patterns of interactions, which are
correlated to social rank, but not exclusively. A network analysis shows that a relatively large
number of individual form a core which strongly influences the movements of the group, the
other individual being more peripherical. This result, among others presented in the paper, is
an interesting one, as it shows that movement may produce or reveal unexpected structures
in social groups, even those with despotic structure. The core of more influent individuals
could be used by the group as a distributed knowledge regarding the location of resources,
for instance.
The paper is clearly written and presents an original methodology to disentangle social
structure and collective movement. It is a valuable contribution to the field. There are a few
aspects below that could be clarified.
-The interaction coefficients beta_i,j do not depend on the separation distance between
individuals i and j. In a spread out group, the effect of distances may be important. In bird
flocks, an interaction radius is often considered in models. A justification for not taking the
distance into account should be given.
This is certainly a limitation of the current study. Combining individual- and locally-based models of
influence is something we plan on examining in future research. We have added a section to the
supplementary material comparing alternative models where we take into account the distance to each
individual (Supp. C). The results of this model comparison, using WAIC, between distance weighted (i.e.,
individual influence is weighted by 1/distance) and the non-weighted model (i.e., eq.1) suggest that the
non-weighted model performs better.
-Eq (2) seems to be a fit which is tested on the calculated beta_i,j rather than an assumption
in the model, but this is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore this equation is a bit confusing.
In addition the variable g_i is not explained (is it a propensity of individual i to follow others
or the center of mass?), and more general fits could also be proposed, for instance
beta_i,j=c_i(Drank_i,j)+g_i, as it is not obvious that beta_i,j should be a linear function of
the rank difference with refactor 1.
We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Dr Fleming also found this confusing. Following Dr Fleming's
comments, we explicitly add in a slope parameter for the effect of rank (Br), and clarify that gi is the
random effect of individual.
“Where ß_(i,j) is the influence weight between individual i and individual j, <U+3016><U+2206>rank<U+3017>_(i,j) is the
difference in rank between individual i and j, <U+3016> ß<U+3017>_r is the estimated effect of rank difference, and g_i
is the random effect of the individual being influenced.”
We agree that it is not obvious that beta_i_j should be a linear function. We have tried a varying slope-
intercept model, but model comparisons suggest that the varying intercept model has more weight
compared to the varying slope intercept model (respectively 0.77 and 0.22), and the estimate of the
rank effect does not change qualitatively (i.e., brank ~ 0.007).
-Little is said in the methods on how the rank of each individual was estimated in the group.
We elaborate on the calculation of rank within our troop:
“We used ad hoc records of decided agonistic contest over the study period to assign each adult an
ordinal dominance rank. The Domicalc program (Schmidt & De Vries 2013) was used to confirm a high
degree of linearity in the hierarchy (h1 = 1; N = 704; P < 0.0001).”
Schmid, V.S. & de Vries, H. (2013) Finding a dominance order most consistent with a linear hierarchy:
an improved algorithm for the I&SI method. Animal Behaviour, 86, 1097-1105.
-The three-layer structure found looks a bit subtle for a network composed of only 14 nodes.
How reliable is this extra-core composed of 2 individuals, in-between the core and the
periphery? Couldn't these nodes be incorporated to one of the two other components? If it is
real, what could explain the presence of three layers and what could be a possible function of
such structure? Similarly, the presence of a low ranking female in the core could indicate a
special role for this individual, or be a consequence of the limitation of the method exposed
on page 8.
We agree that the subtle structure in the network could contain interesting information about the
influence in the movement of the troop. However given our simulation results we would need to perform
an additional analysis on the uncertainty around specific structures. For example, for the current
network we have used the estimated Bi,j parameters from equation 1. We could generate many
networks using random draws from the distribution of (e.g., Bi,j +- sd), and see if those subtle
structures in the core/periphery remain. Given our goal in this paper, however, we feel that the
demonstration of non-random structure is sufficient for this paper. We obviously agree that the
uncertainty of the details of the structures can be examined in more detail in future work to provide
insights into the specifics of group influence.
It is interesting that the core-periphery structure estimated using both the linear regression and the
circular regression approach were very similar. The estimated core remained the same, though there
were two changes in the periphery structure.

ly have some minor comments remaining:
ink it should be better mentioned in the main text surrounding eqn. 1 that the x and y components
't actually be independent (once you pin down one component of a unit vector, the other
ponent can only take 2 possible values), and then I would reference the new circular statistics
erial in the appendix.
ould also check through simulation if your standard errors behind the coefficient CIs need to be
eased by a factor of approximately sqrt(2) as a correction for counting both the x & y components
ndependent data. Alternatively, I suppose you could use something like a parametric bootstrap to
erate the CIs. I'm not familiar with the packages you used to run the analysis, but if they do
ething like a bootstrap yet simulate independent x & y components, then that wouldn't correct
the non-independence.
he reviewer suggests, we checked to see if our standard errors are underestimated given the non-
ependence of x and y. We used a bootstrapping procedure resampling from all x and y rows. This
wed model fitting to be done with bootstrapped datasets that contained, for example, only the y
ponent of an observation and no x. The results from this bootstrap test do indeed suggest that the
dard errors are underestimated, correctly predicted by the reviewer!
suggest the following statement as a means of addressing the non-independence of x,y and
sequent underestimation of the standard errors:
ven our treatment of x and y as independent, though they are not, we expect to have narrower
dard errors around our estimates of movement bias. We therefore use 99% confidence intervals to
mate whether we have sufficient evidence for the correct sign of the effect (i.e., positive/negative
vement bias). See Supplementary B for an alternative method that fully treats x and y as dependent,
results in qualitatively the same outcomes.”
