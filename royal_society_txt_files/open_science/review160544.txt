The manuscript "Competing metabolic strategies in a
multilevel selection model" addresses an interesting question of ecological competition between
two species with different metabolic and growth strategies: An efficient eater and slow grower
and an inefficient consumer but a fast grower. The questions asked in the paper are not
particularly new, however, not all problems related to such competition models are entirely
understood. The Authors reach a fairly intuitive conclusion that the segregation helps the
efficient species to outcompete the inefficient one. I think the manuscript strikes an almost perfect
balance between analytic results, intuitive explanations and numerics, provides interesting
insights onto those long-standing problems and could be published after a minor revision. I see
the main shortcoming of the present text in perpetual references to kin selection, which is
repeated as a mantra through the text as some additional and even mysterious force which helps
cooperators. However, things could be demystified by stating that there is no need in any
relatedness among cooperators, and in fact there is no measure of relatedness in the model at all,
just a simple positive correlation among the distribution of species would do a trick. In other
words, collecting efficient feeders into a group, whether they are of the same kin or not, would
benefit them equally well. I wish the Authors could somehow shift the focus of their narrative
and mention this more materialistic
explanation.
And a few minor comments:
P.14 line 42 needs an additional word
Social Dilemma are loaded word which have various meanings depending on context. The
particular use here needs more explanation.
P. 16, bottom paragraph. Please provide a little more explanation about the effect of stochasticity
in the case of smaller groups. I guess even a quantitative estimate is possible.
Perhaps on every second occasion, "Soaring" could be replaced by a more common term

Amado et al propose a mathematical model to study the evolutionary dynamics and social
dilemmas in a mixed population of two genotypes with competing metabolic strategies; one with
a slow-growing high energy yield metabolism and the other with a fast-growing low energy yield
metabolism. In particular, they investigate the conditions leading to the emergence and
maintenance of the high-yield genotypes by studying the evolutionary dynamics of well-mixed
and structured populations. The authors present analytical results for well-mixed populations as
a basis for comparison and simulation results for both well-mixed and structured populations.
The main finding of their analyses is that high-yield genotypes emerge and are stable for a
broader domain of parameter space in structured populations compared to the well-mixed ones
suggesting that group structure promotes the emergence and maintenance of high-yield
genotypes.
Given that this work is trying to address a fundamental question in evolutionary biology (i.e., the
evolution of cooperation), it is a step in the right direction. However, I have a number of major
concerns about how the simulation studies were designed and the novelty of the main findings of
this study as outlined below:
MAJOR CONCERNS
(1) Identifying the parameter regions leading to a social dilemma in simulation studies are
based on the value of quantity r defined in Equation 7. However, the major issue with this
analysis is that given expression for r (in Equation 7) is valid only for a well-mixed population
not for structured populations. For structured populations a modified form of r that takes into
account the impact of group splitting has to be developed and used in simulations. The authors
have already discussed the importance of group splitting in Discussion, however, this has not
been incorporated into their analysis. In fact, I think that the non-monotonicity behavior observed
in the relative fixation probability for structured populations (Fig. 3) could be just an artifact of
the model due to using r relevant only for well-mixed populations in the analysis of structured
ones.
(2) The authors aimed to develop a resource-based model simulating fast-growing low-yield
and slow-growing high-yield genotypes. However, as they have acknowledged too, the
developed model does not capture this fundamental behavior when eta_ATP > 1, where a fast-
growing strain can also become more energy efficient at large amounts of the resource. The
authors are not clear in the text about how the simulation studies were designed to make sure
that they are well away form this region of high per capita resource availability thus making it
difficult to ensure the universality of their conclusions based on the proposed model.
(3) The authors talk about accounting for the impact of stochasticity in their analysis;
however, they are not clear in the text how/where these stochastic effects were incorporated in
simulations.
(4) The main finding this study is that the existence of group structure promotes the
emergence and stability of high-yield genotypes (cooperators). While this is a sound conclusion,
4
it is not a novel finding and has been known before (PMID: 17158317). Therefore, the authors
need to clarify what the contribution of their work is.
MINOR CONCERNS
(5) The authors mention in the abstract that they have “shown” that group expansion;
overlapping generations and group split can offset the negative impact of local competition
inside the group. However, the possible impacts of these mechanisms have been just discussed in
Discussion but no analysis has been presented to “show” their impact. Please modify the abstract
accordingly to properly reflect what has been presented in this study.
(6) It is hard to understand what quantity (e.g., rate, yield, concentration, etc.) the defined
variables and parameters represent. For example, S_D^i(S_G) in Equation (1) has been defined as
the ‘amount’ of resource per strain D in group i, which is unclear whether this refers to the
concentration of the resource used by strain D or the consumption rate of the resource by strain
D. Similarly, it is unclear whether DeltaE_ij in Equation (3) is a yield or a rate. The authors should
mention the units for all quantities they define to avoid any such confusions.
(7) Stability analysis of the fixed points (in the section for analytical results), which in fact
are analogous to the carrying capacity for population size in logistic growth equation, is
straightforward and any details can be moved to supplementary information.
(8) Please provide all relevant parameters for the plots discussed in the text. For example, in
the discussion of Fig. 6 for migration analysis (pages 17 and 18) mentioning only Delta_ATP is
not enough. The relevant values of Gamma_ATP or r have to be mentioned as well. Please also
provide the population sizes used for the migration plots in Fig. 6 and clearly define the
migration rate.

Comments to the Author(s)

The authors need to address the following concerns regarding their replies to the concerns raised
in the initial review:
- Concern (1):
Quantity r (defined in Eqn 7) does depend on the population structure: r is a function of S_D and
S_G (Eqn 7) and S_D and S_G are a function of S* (Eqns 5 and 6). The authors thus assume (in
Eqns 5 and 6) that all individuals experience the same resource influx rate to the community (S*)
meaning that r is valid for a well-mixed population only. However, the proposed resource
utilization model assumes that all groups take an equal portion of the entire resource (S/N_G),
meaning that we have a structured population (otherwise, if we have a well-mixed population,
the portion of the entire resource each group would take should be proportional to the resource
utilization rate by that group). All these imply that while the proposed model deals with a
structured population, r is valid only for a well-mixed population. Therefore, r, the way it has
been defined, cannot be used to analyze the structured population under study.
- Concern (3):
Changes in the population size, as a function of the variations in resource supply per se is not a
stochastic effect unless there is some stochasticity in the resource supply, which is not taken into
account here. Random death rate and random group splitting are thus the only stochastic effects
considered here, which are standard in such studies. Therefore, emphasizing that this study takes
into account stochastic effects does not seem to properly reflect the main focus of this study and
the text should be adjusted accordingly. In addition, if the death rate and group splitting are
random, there should be a clear mentioning of the what method of sampling from what
distribution has been used.
- Concern (4):
The feedback between population size and resource availability is not new and is equivalent to
what has been known before as “eco-evolutionary” feedback (see PMID: 19414476 & PMID:
21273479)
- Concern (6):
Please mention in the main text that the units of the defined variables/parameters are given in SI.

modification made in the manuscript.
First Reviewer:
(i) Reviewer’s comments: “I see the main shortcoming of the present
text in perpetual references to kin selection, which is repeated as a
mantra through the text as some additional and even mysterious force
which helps cooperators. However, things could be demystified by stat-
ing that there is no need in any relatedness among cooperators, and in
fact there is no measure of relatedness in the model at all, just a simple
positive correlation among the distribution of species would do a trick.
In other words, collecting efficient feeders into a group, whether they
are of the same kin or not, would benefit them equally well. I wish the
Authors could somehow shift the focus of their narrative and mention
this more materialistic explanation.”
Authors’ reply: We agree with the Reviewer. We reformulated the
text to lift the focus off kin selection. Several parts of the manuscript
were changed to address this question, more substantially the sections
Introduction and Discussion. We added the sentence suggested by the
Reviewer in the last paragraph of Section Conclusion.
(ii) Reviewer’s comments: “P.14 line 42 needs an additional word”
Authors’ reply: We rephrased the sentence (page 14).
(iii) Reviewer’s comments: “Social Dilemma are loaded word which have
various meanings depending on context. The particular use here needs
more explanation.”
Authors’ reply: We specifically clarify this now in the first paragraph
of Introduction.
(iv) Reviewer’s comments: “P. 16, bottom paragraph. Please provide a
little more explanation about the effect of stochasticity in the case of
smaller groups. I guess even a quantitative estimate is possible.”
Authors’ reply: We added some more explanations about the effect
of the group size, and thus the stochasticity, to the first paragraph of
page 16.
(v) Reviewer’s comments: “Perhaps on every second occasion, “Soar-
ing” could be replaced by a more common term”
Authors’ reply: We replaced this word throughout the text.
Second Reviewer:
(1) Reviewer’s comments: “Identifying the parameter regions leading
to a social dilemma in simulation studies are based on the value of
quantity r defined in Equation 7. However, the major issue with this
analysis is that given expression for r (in Equation 7) is valid only for a
well-mixed population not for structured populations. For structured
populations a modified form of r that takes into account the impact
of group splitting has to be developed and used in simulations. The
authors have already discussed the importance of group splitting in
Discussion, however, this has not been incorporated into their analysis.
In fact, I think that the non-monotonicity behavior observed in the
relative fixation probability for structured populations (Fig. 3) could
be just an artifact of the model due to using r relevant only for well-
mixed populations in the analysis of structured ones.”
Authors’ reply: It is important to clarify that r is not a parameter of
the model. Instead, it is a measurement of the relative performance of
defectors and cooperators defined only by the metabolic properties of
individuals, regardless of the population structure. This is particularly
true in the limit of small S/N , which is always satisfied when <U+03BD>/aD is
small (as we can infer from Eq. (12)). The condition of small <U+03BD>/aD
is very realistic as large values of <U+03BD>/aD mean extinction of the whole
population. Therefore, the regime at which we use to delimitate the
onset social dilemma coincides with the physically sounding regime.
(2) Reviewer’s comments: “The authors aimed to develop a resource-
based model simulating fast-growing low-yield and slow-growing high-
yield genotypes. However, as they have acknowledged too, the devel-
oped model does not capture this fundamental behavior when eta ATP
> 1, where a fast-growing strain can also become more energy efficient
at large amounts of the resource. The authors are not clear in the text
about how the simulation studies were designed to make sure that they
are well away form this region of high per capita resource availability
thus making it difficult to ensure the universality of their conclusions
based on the proposed model.”
Authors’ reply: As we mention in the previous question, our model is
self-organized in such way that its size N at the stationary state is de-
termined by both the availability of resource and metabolic properties
of the cells. Of course, if the cells are very inefficient this means that
the system can not sustain a large population. At the stationary state
there is balance between the number of individuals eliminated at rate <U+03BD>
(death rate) and the number of newborn cells as the energy storage of
each cell surpasses the threshold value Emax . An inefficient metabolism
means that it is more difficult to reach this threshold and so the pop-
ulation size is smaller (as we can see from Fig. S1). As the ratio <U+03BD>/aD
is assumed to be small (as a large <U+03BD>/aD entails population extinction),
from Eq. (12) we obtain that in this limit S/n is proportional to <U+03BD>/aD .
In order to emphasize the point raised by the Reviewer, this discussion
has been added to main text ( page 13).
(3) Reviewer’s comments: “The authors talk about accounting for the
impact of stochasticity in their analysis; however, they are not clear
in the text how/where these stochastic effects were incorporated in
simulations.”
Authors’ reply: In a broad sense, it is natural that stochastic effects
exist when we deal with finite populations. Here the population size
fluctuates. In this sense the population is self-organized and its size is
determined by the supply of resource as well as the metabolic proper-
ties of its constituents. Other components contribute to stochasticity:
random death and random sampling in the process of group splitting.
As we know from probability theory the variation of the frequency a
given trait from this process of sampling scales as 1/P , being P the
size of the new formed group. In this way it is expected that smaller
groups (smaller Pmax ) face more drastic changes in their composition.
(4) Reviewer’s comments: “The main finding this study is that the
existence of group structure promotes the emergence and stability of
high-yield genotypes (cooperators). While this is a sound conclusion,
it is not a novel finding and has been known before (PMID: 17158317).
Therefore, the authors need to clarify what the contribution of their
work is.”
Authors’ reply: We thank the reviewer for pointing out this useful lit-
erature about multilevel selection models and we have cited it together
with other related papers. In Nowak, Science, 2006 and Traulsen &
Nowak, PNAS, 2006, a population is composed of multiple groups and
a group splits into two when it reaches a certain size; selection appears
in the individual level as well as in the group level. In our model,
we have a similar set up of group splitting. The biggest difference is
that we address the maintenance of cooperation in the context of re-
source competition. This leads to some fundamental differences from
previous model. First, in our definition of resource utility, we dont
consider pairwise interactions between cooperator and defector and the
payoffs are not constant numbers as in the previous paper. Secondly,
the resource per group in our model is dynamical - the group number
increases/decreases over time but the total resource for the whole pop-
ulation is constant. This mimics a natural situation where the resource
in the environment is not infinite and brings another level of complexity
between population dynamics and selection. Suppose a population of
many pure cooperator groups, the number of groups as well as the to-
tal population size will increase fast initially as these cooperator groups
split fast. However, this increasing population size/group number will
in turn lower the resource portion for each group/individual, thus in-
crease the selection intensity. Such a natural feedback between pop-
ulation size and selection intensity is an important new aspect of our
model.
In general, our model builds a very important linkage between multi-
level selection and energetic efficiency/resource utility. This allows us
to understand when and how local competition inside and between the
groups as well as groups elasticity, group splitting and group size act
concomitantly to promote the cooperative trait.
Minor Comments
(5) Reviewer’s comments: “The authors mention in the abstract that
they have shown that group expansion; overlapping generations and
group split can offset the negative impact of local competition inside
the group. However, the possible impacts of these mechanisms have
been just discussed in Discussion but no analysis has been presented to
show their impact. Please modify the abstract accordingly to properly
reflect what has been presented in this study.”
Authors’ reply: The referred sentence has been removed in order to
attend the Reviewer’s concern as it also matches the requirement of
the First Reviewer concerning the emphasis about kin selection in the
previous version.
(6) Reviewer’s comments: “It is hard to understand what quantity (e.g.,
rate, yield, concentration, etc.) the defined variables and parameters
represent. For example, S Di^(S G) in Equation (1) has been defined
as the amount of resource per strain D in group i, which is unclear
whether this refers to the concentration of the resource used by strain
D or the consumption rate of the resource by strain D. Similarly, it
is unclear whether DeltaE ij in Equation (3) is a yield or a rate. The
authors should mention the units for all quantities they define to avoid
any such confusions.”
Authors’ reply: We followed the Reviewer’s recommendation. Now
in the Supporting Information we added a new section “Parameter
summary” where we list the variables and their corresponding units.
Along the text we also changed the word “generation” by “time step”
since it reflects better our definition of time.
(7) Reviewer’s comments: “Stability analysis of the fixed points (in
the section for analytical results), which in fact are analogous to the
carrying capacity for population size in logistic growth equation, is
straightforward and any details can be moved to supplementary infor-
mation.”
Authors’ reply: Although the analysis is very simple, we understand
that for the sake of completeness and clarification for the reader it
should be kept as it is.
(8) Reviewer’s comments: “Please provide all relevant parameters for
the plots discussed in the text. For example, in the discussion of Fig.
6 for migration analysis (pages 17 and 18) mentioning only Delta ATP
is not enough. The relevant values of Gamma ATP or r have to be
mentioned as well. Please also provide the population sizes used for
the migration plots in Fig. 6 and clearly define the migration rate.”
Authors’ reply: We have provided all parameters in the captions in
each figure. The captions are listed in the end of the manuscript. We
would like to point out that the population sizes are an outcome of the
dynamics instead of a parameter of the model.

Appendix B

Royal Society Open Science
Dear Editor,
First of all, we would like to thank for the positive decision concerning the
acceptance of our manuscript as a research article in Royal Society Open
Science. We also acknowledge the positive feedback from the two Reviewers.
Here we resubmit the manuscript with minor changes as suggested in the last
Reviewer’s report.
Below we enumerate the changes made in the manuscript.
(i) As we answered in the previous report r is only defined for a pairwise
competition. It is quantitative but mainly an informative measurement
about the competition regime regardless the population structure. In
our resource-based modelling, the quantity is calculated in the limit
that the availability of resource per individual is pretty small, as ac-
tually expected and observed from the simulations. In this limit the
quantity becomes independent of the resource supply S (calculations
demonstrated in the manuscript). To emphasize that r is not depen-
dent on S we added a new sentence in the last line of third paragraph
on page 14.
(ii) In the manuscript we now emphasize that the death process and the
group splitting procedure are random processes. The latter process
alters group composition and can favor the formation of cooperative
by chance, which becomes more likely as smaller group sizes are con-
sidered. These two processes introduce stochasticity into the system.
This point is highlighted on the second paragraph of page 6.
(iii) The two references suggested by the Reviewer were added in the second
paragraph of subsection 2.1.
(iv) The sentence “The units of the defined variables/parameters are given
in Supporting Information” was added to the main text (last sentence
of page 7).
Yours sincerely,
The authors
