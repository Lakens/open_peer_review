This paper measures the greeting behavior of wolf pups towards people of varying degrees of
familiarity at two time points in an attempt to determine if wolves form attachments to human
caregivers and how those attachments change over time. This paper is unique in its use of
greeting behavior to measure attachment behavior and its attempt to explore how attachment
behavior in wolf pups changes over time. This is a useful contribution to the literature; however,
it does have some areas that need reworking before it is publishable.
1) The language is sometimes confusing or grammatically incorrect.
2) As the authors note it is not possible to make comparisons between the experiments with
confidence due to the methodological differences. However, interesting and worthwhile
comparisons can still be made within the experiments. Currently, the majority of the conclusions
are comparisons between the experiments, even though the authors state that these conclusions
could be due to methodological differences, this is still not appropriate. These thoughts should
be kept short and to the point in the discussion section and stated as possible future directions,
not as conclusions.
3) While described as greeting behaviors two of the dominant behaviors recorded seem like they
are likely not exclusively greeting behaviors, but also exploratory behaviors (proximity, touch).
The overlap of greeting and exploration is discussed, but from the perspective of the wolves
behavior. I suspect this is more of an artifact of the behaviors chosen for coding rather than the
behavior of wolves (proximity and touch are not exclusive to greeting behavior). This in no way
invalidates the findings, but does change the discussion of the findings somewhat.
More specific comments on these issues as well as some other more minor issues are listed below:
Page 1
Title: nexus can mean connection or link (although usually associated with a series or group of
things), but this use is awkward. Usually, nexus is followed by a preposition, “the nexus of” or
“the nexus between”… I would suggest rephrasing the title. For example,” varying levels of
familiarity.” And eliminating the use of the word nexus throughout.
Key words: I would suggest including attachment
Intro
Grammar and language should be edited throughout the introduction.
Examples:
Line: 41-44 is a run on
Line 44-45 is confusing
Line 46 “The dog-owner relationship is the closest humans have probably ever had with
members of another species.”
The closest relationship? That is highly subjective and unnecessary, many other socialized
animals have been found to do the things dogs do with people and those who live with them
would probably argue their bonds with those animals are just as close.
3
Line 47 makes it sound like intensive research has be done on facing stressful situations, need to
start with more general statement about what the intensive research has been on in the last two
decades that covers these different categories then launch into specifics in next sentence.
Page 2
Line1-2: “In most hand-raising projects the wolves had less exposure to humans than what is
typical for dogs, and even if extensively socialized by a group of raisers, there
was no person who was constantly present around the animals.”
While The Family Dog Project, is “unique in having provided each wolf with its own foster
parent and having raised the wolf in her/his home” Line 1-2 is overstating the facts. Given the
protocol of Klinghammer and Goodman, which all but perhaps 1 one of the projects since its
publication in 1987 followed, the only way to socialize wolf pups is with more human exposure
than normally provided to a dog it is misleading to say most had less exposure to humans and in
at least several of the studies listed in Table one there was a single person who was constantly
present around the animals during rearing e.g. Fentress reared Lupey and wolf park (Udell and
Lord) has a primary care taker that is constantly present around the animals for 2-4 months.
The quotes provided in Table 1 attest to the statement either and are taken out of context For
example the Fedderson pedderson quote is in regards to hierarchy and relations between the
wolves themselves, and the quote from Lord is in the context of response to sound not
relationship with humans.
Line 26-26
“In the course of this ceremony the subordinate animal excitedly nips at, licks and
smells the mouth of the dominant individual. This behaviour is usually coupled with a lowered
tail and body posture and with lowered ears, held close to the head [35].”
In the wild “dominant animal” is generally the parents or older sibling, therefore given that this
paper is on attachment, it would seem more appropriate to describe this in terms of pups greeting
adults, particularly since much of this behavior is associated with soliciting regurgitations. Also
later the tucked tail is used as a fear behavior, should describe if this is different from the lowered
tail described here.
Line 35 use of word nexus
Page 3
Line 0: “and had maybe been exemplified only by” awkward wording
Line 57-1 tense agreement, and run on sentence.
Line 55 “kind tone of voice” is vague. Can you be more descriptive e.g. high pitch? Tonal?
Line 48-51 I assume the familiar person who entered first was not counted in greeting behaviors,
but this is not made clear in methods.
Page 4
Line 15-16, explain what is meant by final model? Do you mean when you ran the test again with
the second set of data with the older wolves? Or do you mean you ran the model multiple times
on the same data? And explain why.
Results exp 1
I assume graphs are done as proportion of time for ease of interpretation, but was data analyzed
this way or by duration (seconds), should be made clear in methods and if done as proportion
this choice should be explained.

Page 6
Line 10 “nexus”
Discussion exp 1
Line 19-20 add reference
Line 43 given that the wolves have been alive for longer in experiment 2 is the close acquaintance
definition still the same? Is this still someone they have known since 4 weeks and have spent at
least once a week with ever since? If yes than this is actually a different experience from the first
experiment and should be taken into consideration in discussion.
Materials and methods
Lines 44-45 Make clear if this is the same or different from exp. 1
Procedures
The bullets don’t work well here; this format makes this information more difficult to
understand. It would be clearer to write in paragraph format and explain the differences, for
example: The cameraperson stood outside of enclosure rather than inside the enclosure.
The second third and fourth bullet points are the most confusing.
Page 7
Line 20-22 again it is unclear why you are running some models without interaction term.
Page 11
Line 7 “nexus”
Do you calculate reliability for either experiment?
Line 17-18 “This may indicate that “greeting” total strangers may be
rather an exploration of novel social stimuli than an expression of the animals' relationship with
or social affinity to such people.”
This seems likely due to your behavioral measures rather than to the greeting behavior of the
wolves. It would seem that proximity and contact could contain behaviors other than greeting
such as exploration, while jumping and tail wagging in particular would be more specific to
greeting.
Line 27 “nexus”
The majority of the conclusion is new information. Conclusion should be a wrap up of the paper
not introduction of new material. This new information should go in the discussion. Also, much
of it is related to comparisons between the two experiments, which as the authors point out,
cannot really be made with any confidence due to the differences in methods. These things are
fine to mention as possible future directions, but are inappropriate as major conclusions, and little
space should be dedicated to them.
5
Table 3&4 could be condensed into one. As text stands it sounds like the ethogram was the same,
but not all behaviors were observed. If this is not the case and some behavior were only being
looked for in the second experiment this could be designated in the table.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In the current study the authors explored wolf-human relationship and in particular they focused
on greeting behaviours of hand reared, extensively socialized wolves towards human visitors
with whom they have different social relationships: foster-parents, close acquaintances, persons
met only once before, and complete strangers.
In Experiment 1, the authors observed the greeting behaviors of two groups of young (6 months
old) socialized wolves upon arrival of varying visitors using a Greeting Situation Test (GST); in
Experiment 2 the same wolves were observed individually in a similar situation at the age of 12
and 24 months. The idea of investigating wolves’ behaviour towards different types of visitors
and to carry out a greeting test on wolves of different ages is interesting and original, and adds to
our knowledge of the wolf–human relationship and of the dog-human relationship and its
origins; in fact, as the authors state, little is known about to what extent the relationship wolves
develop to their “owner” is comparable to that of dogs, and the available evidence is still
controversial.
The manuscript is overall well written and clearly organized, however, in my opinion, there are
some aspects that the authors need to address carefully before the manuscript can be considered
for publication. In particular, I am concerned about the lack of interobserver agreement on the
behaviour variables recorded in Experiment 1 and 2. In my opinion this aspect is essential for
publication of the manuscript. Another aspect that I would like to understand better is why only
the 12 and 24 months old wolves were tested individually. Testing all wolves individually would
have been better in terms of procedure.
Some parts of the manuscript are not clearly written and do not provide the necessary
information to the reader: thus some rearrangement is needed, mainly in the Materials and
methods sections. Discussion of Experiment 1 and 2 and general conclusions are overall clear and
well organized.

Below I provide some suggestions as to how the manuscript could be revised, hoping they will be
of help:
Summary.
Page 1-Line 26-27. The authors say “we analysed greeting behaviours of hand reared, extensively
socialized wolves” and then on line 28-29 they just consider “ intense and friendly contact
seeking behaviours”; are contact seeking behaviors and greeting behaviours the same thing? I
would say greeting is different from contact seeking alone. I suggest defining better what the
authors consider to be part of greeting. For example proximity seeking can be observed, at least
in dogs, in situations quite different from greeting.
Page 1-Line 32. “We showed that, in case of extensively socialized wolves, distinctive affiliation
and affinity towards the foster parent prevails into adulthood even if dependence on the hand
rearing human cannot be revealed”. This sentence is rather unclear. Please rephrase.
Introduction. The introduction is well organized in terms of basic background information and
study goals.
Page 1 -Line 43. Is ref 4 relevant here? Why?
Page 2-line 39. “First, we were interested in seeing whether the greeting behaviour of wolves is a
sensitive enough measure that differentiates even between first time and second time visits of
strangers”. This sentence is unclear.
Page 2-line 39. “First, we were interested in seeing whether the greeting behaviour of wolves is a
sensitive enough measure that differentiates even between first time and second time visits of
strangers”. This sentence is unclear.
Materials and Methods – General: Subjects. In the introduction the authors say that they tested
the same subjects tested by Topál and colleagues (2005) at an older age to assess whether they
greeted their raisers differently to strangers in familiar surroundings, under well-known
circumstances; I think it would be useful reminding this in the subject section, so that it is clear
that the wolves tested in this study are the same tested at an earlier age by Topál and colleagues
in the SST.
Experiment 1 – Group Greeting Situation Test
Page 3-lines 23-24. “ ….they still regularly spent longer periods of time in the garden around their
owners' house where the greeting tests took place”. It seems that the subjects were tested as a
group (4 each year) and that the greeting tests were carried out in the owners’ garden. However,
in the Procedure section (line 41) the authors say that “Testing took place in the yard where
subjects (all pack mates) lived from approximately 4 months of age. Subjects were free to roam
the entire yard, and were able to see the approaching visitor through the wire mesh fencing”. So,
I do not understand were the testing took place: in the owners’ garden? In the yard? Moreover,
how large was the owner’s garden? And how large was the yard were they were free to roam?
Visitors: page 3 line 28. “Four visitor types (comprised of 3-7 individuals)”. It seems that
different individuals played the role of the two strangers and the close acquaintance: why
different persons? How many different strangers and close acquaintances were used in the test?
Procedures -Page 3- lines 38-46. The description of the procedure is unclear. The authors should
explain better the procedure and also clarify the rationale to repeatedly measure the behaviour of
the wolves with the different visitor types, using several individuals belonging to each type (e.g
why 11 testing days). I would also like to know how large was the testing area and thus how far
could the wolves be when a visitor entered through the gate.
7
Page 3, Calling phase. Did the visitors call all the subject by name? Or did theiy just say “come,
come”? It is difficult for me to figure out the testing situation, with 4 wolves being called at the
same time and being petted at the same time. I also wonder wether a social facilitation effect
occurred with one wolf approaching the person and the other following it. And how this might
have affected individuals’ behavior.
Page 4 Behavioural analyses
As the aim of the study was to measure greeting behaviour I assume that the 4 categories
reported in table 3 (proximity, contact, jumping and wagging ) are all different component of
“greeting behaviour” as a whole. However I suggest specifying better in the text that greeting
behaviour was evaluated considering 4 different behaviours (i.e proximity, contact jumping and
wagging). I also assume that the remaining other behaviour variables ( i.e. lying down, tugging
clothes, flight response, urination/defecation, yapping, growling or attack) cited by the authors
were not observed in the sense that they were part of an initial ethogram but never occurred in
the testing situation. Is my assumption correct?
The most problematic aspect of behavioural analyses section is that no interobserver agreements
for the 4 behaviours recorded is reported. As already said in the introductory comments
interobserver agreement should be calculated and reported in the manuscript.
Discussion – Experiment 1
Page 6 lines 19-21. The authors underline the possible impact on wolves greeting behaviour of
the group testing. I fully agree with their concern and I wonder why they did not test subjects
individually, as they did with 12 months old wolves, given the greeting test required only short
separations from other individuals.
Experiment 2 – Individual Greeting Situation Test
Page 6 -line 30. The authors say they expected more fear related behaviours toward strangers:
could they briefly explain why?
Visitors (see also page 3 line 28). Now I understand better the rationale for having several
people in each visitor type (i.e.to minimize the effect of individual differences).
Procedures
Page 6 –line 49-50. “Procedures were similar to those of Experiment 1 except for the following
differences”. Why, apart from individual testing, other procedural changes were introduced? For
example, why introducing a third phase to the protocol including it into behavioural analyses. I
think a short explanation for this changes is needed.
Page 7- Behavioural analyses
Same problem as for Experiment 1. Interobserver agreement should be evaluated for all
behaviours and reported in the text.
Results – Experiment 2. Page 7 line 36: ((
Conclusions: Conclusions are clearly written well organized. I agree that this study is the first
investigating the relationship of intensively socialized hand reared wolves with humans of
different types in a Greeting Situation Test and in investigating the wolf-human relationship
going into adulthood. I am not sure, however that these results can be easily compared with
earlier findings on attachment as measured in the Strange Situation Test: the SST procedure and
the the current Greeting Test, either individual or in group, are quite different in their aims and
pick up different aspects of the relationship: attachment and affiliative behaviour . It also seems
to me that “greeting behaviour” after an unwanted separation in an unfamiliar environment is
different from greeting a familiar person met in a very familiar environment.

In the current study the authors explored wolf-human relationship and in particular they focused
on greeting behaviours of hand reared, extensively socialized wolves towards human visitors
with whom they have different social relationships: foster-parents, close acquaintances, persons
met only once before, and complete strangers.
In Experiment 1, the authors observed the greeting behaviors of two groups of young (6 months
old) socialized wolves upon arrival of varying visitors using a Greeting Situation Test (GST); in
Experiment 2 the same wolves were observed individually in a similar situation at the age of 12

would say greeting is different from contact seeking alone. I suggest defining better what the
authors consider to be part of greeting. For example proximity seeking can be observed, at least
in dogs, in situations quite different from greeting.
Page 1-Line 32. “We showed that, in case of extensively socialized wolves, distinctive affiliation
and affinity towards the foster parent prevails into adulthood even if dependence on the hand
rearing human cannot be revealed”. This sentence is rather unclear. Please rephrase.
Introduction. The introduction is well organized in terms of basic background information and
study goals.
Page 1 -Line 43. Is ref 4 relevant here? Why?
Page 2-line 39. “First, we were interested in seeing whether the greeting behaviour of wolves is a
sensitive enough measure that differentiates even between first time and second time visits of
strangers”. This sentence is unclear.
Page 2-line 39. “First, we were interested in seeing whether the greeting behaviour of wolves is a
sensitive enough measure that differentiates even between first time and second time visits of
strangers”. This sentence is unclear.
Materials and Methods – General: Subjects. In the introduction the authors say that they tested
the same subjects tested by Topál and colleagues (2005) at an older age to assess whether they
greeted their raisers differently to strangers in familiar surroundings, under well-known
circumstances; I think it would be useful reminding this in the subject section, so that it is clear
that the wolves tested in this study are the same tested at an earlier age by Topál and colleagues
in the SST.
Experiment 1 – Group Greeting Situation Test
Page 3-lines 23-24. “ ….they still regularly spent longer periods of time in the garden around their
owners' house where the greeting tests took place”. It seems that the subjects were tested as a
group (4 each year) and that the greeting tests were carried out in the owners’ garden. However,
14
in the Procedure section (line 41) the authors say that “Testing took place in the yard where
subjects (all pack mates) lived from approximately 4 months of age. Subjects were free to roam
the entire yard, and were able to see the approaching visitor through the wire mesh fencing”. So,
I do not understand were the testing took place: in the owners’ garden? In the yard? Moreover,
how large was the owner’s garden? And how large was the yard were they were free to roam?
Visitors: page 3 line 28. “Four visitor types (comprised of 3-7 individuals)”. It seems that
different individuals played the role of the two strangers and the close acquaintance: why
different persons? How many different strangers and close acquaintances were used in the test?
Procedures -Page 3- lines 38-46. The description of the procedure is unclear. The authors should
explain better the procedure and also clarify the rationale to repeatedly measure the behaviour of
the wolves with the different visitor types, using several individuals belonging to each type (e.g
why 11 testing days). I would also like to know how large was the testing area and thus how far
could the wolves be when a visitor entered through the gate.
Page 3, Calling phase. Did the visitors call all the subject by name? Or did theiy just say “come,
come”? It is difficult for me to figure out the testing situation, with 4 wolves being called at the
same time and being petted at the same time. I also wonder wether a social facilitation effect
occurred with one wolf approaching the person and the other following it. And how this might
have affected individuals’ behavior.
Page 4 Behavioural analyses
As the aim of the study was to measure greeting behaviour I assume that the 4 categories
reported in table 3 (proximity, contact, jumping and wagging ) are all different component of
“greeting behaviour” as a whole. However I suggest specifying better in the text that greeting
behaviour was evaluated considering 4 different behaviours (i.e proximity, contact jumping and
wagging). I also assume that the remaining other behaviour variables ( i.e. lying down, tugging
clothes, flight response, urination/defecation, yapping, growling or attack) cited by the authors
were not observed in the sense that they were part of an initial ethogram but never occurred in
the testing situation. Is my assumption correct?
The most problematic aspect of behavioural analyses section is that no interobserver agreements
for the 4 behaviours recorded is reported. As already said in the introductory comments
interobserver agreement should be calculated and reported in the manuscript.
Discussion – Experiment 1
Page 6 lines 19-21. The authors underline the possible impact on wolves greeting behaviour of
the group testing. I fully agree with their concern and I wonder why they did not test subjects
individually, as they did with 12 months old wolves, given the greeting test required only short
separations from other individuals.
Experiment 2 – Individual Greeting Situation Test
Page 6 -line 30. The authors say they expected more fear related behaviours toward strangers:
could they briefly explain why?
Visitors (see also page 3 line 28). Now I understand better the rationale for having several
people in each visitor type (i.e.to minimize the effect of individual differences).
Procedures
Page 6 –line 49-50. “Procedures were similar to those of Experiment 1 except for the following
differences”. Why, apart from individual testing, other procedural changes were introduced? For
example, why introducing a third phase to the protocol including it into behavioural analyses. I
think a short explanation for this changes is needed.
15
Page 7- Behavioural analyses
Same problem as for Experiment 1. Interobserver agreement should be evaluated for all
behaviours and reported in the text.
Results – Experiment 2. Page 7 line 36: ((
Conclusions: Conclusions are clearly written well organized. I agree that this study is the first
investigating the relationship of intensively socialized hand reared wolves with humans of
different types in a Greeting Situation Test and in investigating the wolf-human relationship
going into adulthood. I am not sure, however that these results can be easily compared with
earlier findings on attachment as measured in the Strange Situation Test: the SST procedure and
the the current Greeting Test, either individual or in group, are quite different in their aims and
pick up different aspects of the relationship: attachment and affiliative behaviour . It also seems
to me that “greeting behaviour” after an unwanted separation in an unfamiliar environment is
different from greeting a familiar person met in a very familiar environment.

The current manuscript is much improved. There are still some problems with grammar,
although mainly just dropped articles, and a couple awkward sentences. The only moderate

tested in experiment 1 and whether this was the same for both groups of wolves. If not why?

How many times was each visitor type tested, needs to be described in more detail. I think this is

Overall, the manuscript is a nice extension to Topal et al., showing that the wolves show clear
familiarity preference to a caregiver over varying levels of strangers at 6 months and 12-24
months, although the exact nature of the relationship across time with the former foster parent is
unclear due to methodological differences across the testing periods. Despite the methodological
variability, I found the overall results interesting and worthy of publication.
I only had a couple of comments in addition to those provided by the other reviewers. First, in
line 8, I’m not sure it’s quite true to what degree the present socialization method "goes far
beyond" other methods. Much of the prior work used the Wolf Park method (Udell, Lord, Hall,
etc.), which, although true the pups weren’t brought into urban environments with foster
parents, they were in 24-hour contact with their primary caregivers.
Second, I found parts of the Experiment 1 method confusing. Line 6 indicates pups were
individually assigned to foster parents, indicating each wolf had a different foster parent. For the
group GST, was the test repeated using each individual foster parent? Did a Foster for one wolf
count as a stranger to the other pups? Was the whole sequence repeated for each individual wolf
and foster pair? Were all individuals coded for each test? I’m a bit confused as to how this test
was conducted. Also, I tried to look at the raw data to clear up these questions, but the link
presented in the paper was not valid and I didn’t see any supplementary files. Please check the

Comments of Reviewer: 1 and Authors’ point-by-point Responses:
Comments to the Author(s)
This paper measures the greeting behavior of wolf pups towards people of varying degrees of familiarity at
wo time points in an attempt to determine if wolves form attachments to human caregivers and how those
attachments change over time. This paper is unique in its use of greeting behavior to measure attachment
behavior and its attempt to explore how attachment behavior in wolf pups changes over time. This is a
useful contribution to the literature; however, it does have some areas that need reworking before it is
publishable.
Response: Actually, our aim here was not to measure attachment in its classical sense, by strict
definition as in SST (factor of dependence, secure base effect, etc.), but something that is very
imilar, we termed affiliation. The reason for this is that wolves may not show classical attachment at
hese ages, similar to that shown by human infants and adult dogs, but do show markedly different
behaviour toward caregivers and familiar people – which we aimed to quantify in this study. This is
also the reason why attachment was not among our key words.
1) The language is sometimes confusing or grammatically incorrect.
Response: Thank you for drawing our attention to this! We asked a native English speaker to correct
our language mistakes. We hope that the situation is now somewhat improved.
2) As the authors note it is not possible to make comparisons between the experiments with confidence due
o the methodological differences. However, interesting and worthwhile comparisons can still be made
within the experiments. Currently, the majority of the conclusions are comparisons between the
experiments, even though the authors state that these conclusions could be due to methodological
differences, this is still not appropriate. These thoughts should be kept short and to the point in the
discussion section and stated as possible future directions, not as conclusions.
Response: In agreement with you comment, we have shifted focus to comparisons within
experiments as opposed to between experiments. Discussion of differences between experiment are
hortened and the speculative nature of these in this current context is made clear.
3) While described as greeting behaviors two of the dominant behaviors recorded seem like they are likely
not exclusively greeting behaviors, but also exploratory behaviors (proximity, touch). The overlap of
greeting and exploration is discussed, but from the perspective of the wolves behavior. I suspect this is
more of an artefact of the behaviors chosen for coding rather than the behavior of wolves (proximity and
ouch are not exclusive to greeting behavior). This in no way invalidates the findings, but does change the
discussion of the findings somewhat.
Response: We of course agree that proximity and touch are not exclusively greeting behaviors. These
behaviors naturally overlap in various contexts. Our aim, however was not to only code greeting
behaviors, but to code all behaviors shown in course of a specific “greeting episode” (i.e. a person
arriving to the home enclosure of the wolf). The text might not have been clear enough in this
espect. We hope that we succeeded in clarifying this issue.
More specific comments on these issues as well as some other more minor issues are listed below:
Page 1
Title: nexus can mean connection or link (although usually associated with a series or group of things), but
his use is awkward. Usually, nexus is followed by a preposition, “the nexus of” or “the nexus between”… I
would suggest rephrasing the title. For example,” varying levels of familiarity.” And eliminating the use of the
word nexus throughout.
Response: Thank you for pointing that out! It has been rephrased throughout.
Key words: I would suggest including attachment
Response: We would rather not include attachment, because of its strict definition (please see also
our first response above)
ntro
Grammar and language should be edited throughout the introduction.
Examples:
Line: 41-44 is a run on
Response: Has been rephrased.
Line 44-45 is confusing
Response: Has been rephrased.
Line 46 “The dog-owner relationship is the closest humans have probably ever had with members of
another species.”
The closest relationship? That is highly subjective and unnecessary, many other socialized animals have
been found to do the things dogs do with people and those who live with them would probably argue their
bonds with those animals are just as close.
Response: We see your point. This part has been deleted.
Line 47 makes it sound like intensive research has be done on facing stressful situations, need to start with
more general statement about what the intensive research has been on in the last two decades that covers
hese different categories then launch into specifics in next sentence.
Response: Quite true. This part has been rephrased.
Page 2
Line1-2: “In most hand-raising projects the wolves had less exposure to humans than what is typical for
dogs, and even if extensively socialized by a group of raisers, there
was no person who was constantly present around the animals.”
While The Family Dog Project, is “unique in having provided each wolf with its own foster parent and having
aised the wolf in her/his home” Line 1-2 is overstating the facts. Given the protocol of Klinghammer and
Goodman, which all but perhaps 1 one of the projects since its publication in 1987 followed, the only way to
socialize wolf pups is with more human exposure than normally provided to a dog it is misleading to say
most had less exposure to humans and in at least several of the studies listed in Table one there was a
single person who was constantly present around the animals during rearing e.g. Fentress reared Lupey
and wolf park (Udell and Lord) has a primary care taker that is constantly present around the animals for 2-4
months.
Response: We agree with both points made. Has been rephrased.
The quotes provided in Table 1 attest to the statement either and are taken out of context For example the
Fedderson pedderson quote is in regards to hierarchy and relations between the wolves themselves, and
he quote from Lord is in the context of response to sound not relationship with humans.
Response: You are right. Both quotes have been removed from Table 1.
Line 26-26
In the course of this ceremony the subordinate animal excitedly nips at, licks and
smells the mouth of the dominant individual. This behaviour is usually coupled with a lowered tail and body
posture and with lowered ears, held close to the head [35].”
n the wild “dominant animal” is generally the parents or older sibling, therefore given that this paper is on
attachment, it would seem more appropriate to describe this in terms of pups greeting adults, particularly
since much of this behavior is associated with soliciting regurgitations. Also later the tucked tail is used as a
ear behavior, should describe if this is different from the lowered tail described here.
Response: Yes, this definition is probably a bit dated (as the reference also shows), however we did
not find a better one in the literature. Has been rephrased/updated according to your suggestion.
Thank you!
Line 35 use of word nexus
Response: Corrected
Page 3
Line 0: “and had maybe been exemplified only by” awkward wording
Response: Corrected
Line 57-1 tense agreement, and run on sentence.
Response: Corrected
Line 55 “kind tone of voice” is vague. Can you be more descriptive e.g. high pitch? Tonal?
Response: Described in text as high pitched.
Line 48-51 I assume the familiar person who entered first was not counted in greeting behaviors, but this is
not made clear in methods.
Response: Yes, this person was not counted. Made clear in text.
Page 4
Line 15-16, explain what is meant by final model? Do you mean when you ran the test again with the
second set of data with the older wolves? Or do you mean you ran the model multiple times on the same
data? And explain why.
Response: Thank you for pointing out that this may not be clear! We ran the models with the
nteractions first, but only kept those if significant to interpret main effects. We clarified this in the
ext as well.
Results exp 1
assume graphs are done as proportion of time for ease of interpretation, but was data analyzed this way or
by duration (seconds), should be made clear in methods and if done as proportion this choice should be
explained.
Response: Data was calculated as a proportion of the actual length of the phase. The reason for this
was that there was a slight deviation in the lengths of the phases due to technical reasons in the field
delays in timing, instruction of visitors, actual behaviour of visitors, etc.), so we calculated the
duration measures relative to the actual length of the given phase coded. We hope it is now clear in
he text.
Page 6
Line 10 “nexus”
Response: Corrected
Discussion exp 1
Line 19-20 add reference
Response: Has been added.
Line 43 given that the wolves have been alive for longer in experiment 2 is the close acquaintance definition
still the same? Is this still someone they have known since 4 weeks and have spent at least once a week
with ever since? If yes than this is actually a different experience from the first experiment and should be
aken into consideration in discussion.
Response: Visitors in Experiment 2 have been chosen to fit the original definition. Naturally there has
been some fluctuation of familiar people around the wolves, however we aimed to find people who
were close to the subjects form early age and have met them regularly since.
Materials and methods
Lines 44-45 Make clear if this is the same or different from exp. 1
Response: described in text in more detail.
Procedures
The bullets don’t work well here; this format makes this information more difficult to understand. It would be
clearer to write in paragraph format and explain the differences, for example: The cameraperson stood
outside of enclosure rather than inside the enclosure.
The second third and fourth bullet points are the most confusing.
Response: Rewritten and rephrased according to your suggestion.
Page 7
Line 20-22 again it is unclear why you are running some models without interaction term.
Response: As described also earlier in response to your concern, initially we ran the models with the
nteraction term, but kept them only if significant. Sorry for the confusing wording!

Line 7 “nexus”
Response: Corrected
Do you calculate reliability for either experiment?
Response: Yes, we calculated inter-rater reliability in both experiments by double coding of random frames
by two independent coders (Cohen <U+03BA>’s were calculated) – now included in the Data analysis sections.
Line 17-18 “This may indicate that “greeting” total strangers may be
ather an exploration of novel social stimuli than an expression of the animals' relationship with or social
affinity to such people.”
This seems likely due to your behavioral measures rather than to the greeting behavior of the wolves. It
would seem that proximity and contact could contain behaviors other than greeting such as exploration,
while jumping and tail wagging in particular would be more specific to greeting.
Response: Yes, we fully agree. See also this topic addressed above.
Line 27 “nexus”
Response: Corrected
The majority of the conclusion is new information. Conclusion should be a wrap up of the paper not
ntroduction of new material. This new information should go in the discussion. Also, much of it is related to
comparisons between the two experiments, which as the authors point out, cannot really be made with any
confidence due to the differences in methods. These things are fine to mention as possible future
directions, but are inappropriate as major conclusions, and little space should be dedicated to them.
Response: Yes, we agree. This “long” conclusion was a mistake prompted by the RSOS template.
Modifications to the formatting, as well as the text have been made according to your suggestions.
Table 3&4 could be condensed into one. As text stands it sounds like the ethogram was the same, but not
all behaviors were observed. If this is not the case and some behavior were only being looked for in the
second experiment this could be designated in the table.
Response: Tables were condensed into one (Table 3.), as the ethogram was the same, but not all
behaviors were observed.

Comments to the Author(s)
n the current study the authors explored wolf-human relationship and in particular they focused on greeting
behaviours of hand reared, extensively socialized wolves towards human visitors with whom they have
different social relationships: foster-parents, close acquaintances, persons met only once before, and
complete strangers.
n Experiment 1, the authors observed the greeting behaviors of two groups of young (6 months old)
socialized wolves upon arrival of varying visitors using a Greeting Situation Test (GST); in Experiment 2 the
same wolves were observed individually in a similar situation at the age of 12 and 24 months. The idea of
nvestigating wolves’ behaviour towards different types of visitors and to carry out a greeting test on wolves
of different ages is interesting and original, and adds to our knowledge of the wolf–human relationship
and of the dog-human relationship and its origins; in fact, as the authors state, little is known about to what
extent the relationship wolves develop to their “owner” is comparable to that of dogs, and the available
evidence is still controversial.
The manuscript is overall well written and clearly organized, however, in my opinion, there are some
aspects that the authors need to address carefully before the manuscript can be considered for publication.
n particular, I am concerned about the lack of interobserver agreement on the behaviour variables recorded
n Experiment 1 and 2. In my opinion this aspect is essential for publication of the manuscript. Another
aspect that I would like to understand better is why only the 12 and 24 months old wolves were tested
ndividually. Testing all wolves individually would have been better in terms of procedure.
Some parts of the manuscript are not clearly written and do not provide the necessary information to the
eader: thus some rearrangement is needed, mainly in the Materials and methods sections. Discussion of
Experiment 1 and 2 and general conclusions are overall clear and well organized.
Response: Thank you for your comments!
Regarding inter observer agreement, we have now included in the text that we calculated inter-rater
eliability in both experiments by double coding of random frames by two independent coders (Cohen <U+03BA>’s
were calculated). Results are now added to the Data analysis sections.
n regard of your comment that individual testing throughout would have been a better procedure – we fully
agree. However, when we started Experiment 1, we aimed at testing greeting in a situation that is the least
stressful (most “natural”) for subjects, which seemed to be the group condition. In this regard, we aimed to
make use of social facilitation in a way. However, we found during Experiment 1, that wolves have no stress
elated problems with visitors entering their home enclosure, while in the group condition is no doubt
burdened by the fact that behaviour of subjects is not independent. We had to use repeated measures to try
and address this issue. These are the reasons why we conducted Experiment 2 individually – as we also
ound this to be better in terms of procedure.
Below I provide some suggestions as to how the manuscript could be revised, hoping they will be of help:
Summary.
Page 1-Line 26-27. The authors say “we analysed greeting behaviours of hand reared, extensively
socialized wolves” and then on line 28-29 they just consider “ intense and friendly contact seeking
behaviours”; are contact seeking behaviors and greeting behaviours the same thing? I would say greeting
s different from contact seeking alone. I suggest defining better what the authors consider to be part of
greeting. For example proximity seeking can be observed, at least in dogs, in situations quite different from
greeting.
Response: We by no means wished to suggest that greeting behaviours and contact seeking
behaviours are the same thing. To clarify this, contact seeking has been removed from the
mentioned sentence. Naturally, contact seeking may be found in totally different contexts from
greeting, however it is also part of the greeting behaviour complex. It is important to note that we
not only analysed greeting behaviours, but all behaviours in a specific “greeting episode”, which we
define by a situation where a human enters the home enclosure of the wolf. We hope that this is
now made clear in text.
Page 1-Line 32. “We showed that, in case of extensively socialized wolves, distinctive affiliation and affinity
owards the foster parent prevails into adulthood even if dependence on the hand rearing human cannot be
evealed”. This sentence is rather unclear. Please rephrase.
Response: Has been rephrased.
ntroduction. The introduction is well organized in terms of basic background information and study goals.
Page 1 -Line 43. Is ref 4 relevant here? Why?
Response: Not relevant indeed. Has been removed.
Page 2-line 39. “First, we were interested in seeing whether the greeting behaviour of wolves is a sensitive
enough measure that differentiates even between first time and second time visits of strangers”. This
sentence is unclear.
Response: Has been rephrased.
Materials and Methods – General: Subjects. In the introduction the authors say that they tested the same
subjects tested by Topál and colleagues (2005) at an older age to assess whether they greeted their raisers
differently to strangers in familiar surroundings, under well-known circumstances; I think it would be useful
eminding this in the subject section, so that it is clear that the wolves tested in this study are the same
ested at an earlier age by Topál and colleagues in the SST.
Response: Information has been added to Subjects section.
Experiment 1 – Group Greeting Situation Test
Page 3-lines 23-24. “ ….they still regularly spent longer periods of time in the garden around their owners'
house where the greeting tests took place”. It seems that the subjects were tested as a group (4 each
year) and that the greeting tests were carried out in the owners’ garden. However, in the Procedure section
line 41) the authors say that “Testing took place in the yard where subjects (all pack mates) lived from
approximately 4 months of age. Subjects were free to roam the entire yard, and were able to see the
approaching visitor through the wire mesh fencing”. So, I do not understand were the testing took place: in
he owners’ garden? In the yard? Moreover, how large was the owner’s garden? And how large was the
yard were they were free to roam?
Response: Has been clarified in the text. The garden and the yard mentioned are the same place. The
wolves at that time lived around their owner’s (Horkai Animal Training Center) house in a yard,
where they were free to roam. Size of this yard now included in text.
Visitors: page 3 line 28. “Four visitor types (comprised of 3-7 individuals)”. It seems that different individuals
played the role of the two strangers and the close acquaintance: why different persons? How many different
strangers and close acquaintances were used in the test?
Response: We used different people as strangers (7) and close acquaintances (3) in order to minimize
he possible effect of individual differences between visitors. (Close acquaintances are naturally
harder to come by <U+F04A>). This is now also clarified in the text.
Procedures -Page 3- lines 38-46. The description of the procedure is unclear. The authors should explain
better the procedure and also clarify the rationale to repeatedly measure the behaviour of the wolves with
he different visitor types, using several individuals belonging to each type (e.g why 11 testing days). I would
also like to know how large was the testing area and thus how far could the wolves be when a visitor
entered through the gate.
Response: Procedures are now clarified. As mentioned earlier, we used several different individuals
n order to minimize the effect of individual differences. We used repeated measures, as in the group
ituation the behaviour of the subjects is not independent.
Page 3, Calling phase. Did the visitors call all the subject by name? Or did theiy just say “come, come”? It
s difficult for me to figure out the testing situation, with 4 wolves being called at the same time and being
petted at the same time. I also wonder wether a social facilitation effect occurred with one wolf approaching
he person and the other following it. And how this might have affected individuals’ behavior.
Response: Visitors did not use names, only calling words. We agree that individuals’ behaviour was
not independent in the group situation, and social facilitation may not be ruled out. We attempted to
deal with this by repeated measures and the use of several individuals/visitor type. However, we
changed the setup to individual greeting in Exp 2.The reason we opted for the group condition in
Experiment 1 was mostly in connection to reducing stress related to the entrance of strangers, trying
o make the situation as “natural” as possible.
Page 4 Behavioural analyses
As the aim of the study was to measure greeting behaviour I assume that the 4 categories reported in table
3 (proximity, contact, jumping and wagging ) are all different component of “greeting behaviour” as a
whole. However I suggest specifying better in the text that greeting behaviour was evaluated considering
4 different behaviours (i.e proximity, contact jumping and wagging). I also assume that the remaining other
behaviour variables ( i.e. lying down, tugging clothes, flight response, urination/defecation, yapping,
growling or attack) cited by the authors were not observed in the sense that they were part of an initial
ethogram but never occurred in the testing situation. Is my assumption correct?
Response: Yes, both of your assumptions are correct. We modified the text to make this more clear.
We initially evaluated all behaviours shown in the specific greeting episode (i.e. visitor entering the
enclosure according to protocol) – evaluation was based on the four behaviour components
proximity, contact jumping and wagging) which were found. Remaining variables were not (or only
extremely rarely, for example one single instance) observed in the testing situation.
The most problematic aspect of behavioural analyses section is that no interobserver agreements for the 4
behaviours recorded is reported. As already said in the introductory comments interobserver agreement
should be calculated and reported in the manuscript.
Response: Thank you for this comment! As already stated above, we have now included inter
observer agreement in the text, we calculated inter-rater reliability in both experiments by double coding
of random frames by two independent coders (Cohen <U+03BA>’s were calculated). Results are now added to the
Data analysis sections.
Discussion – Experiment 1
Page 6 lines 19-21. The authors underline the possible impact on wolves greeting behaviour of the group
esting. I fully agree with their concern and I wonder why they did not test subjects individually, as they did
with 12 months old wolves, given the greeting test required only short separations from other individuals.
Response: We aimed to find a testing situation that is the least stressful and closest to natural for the
ubjects. Initially we thought that this will only be possible in their group. In Experiment 2, we have
witched to the individual condition, as we had the same concerns.
Experiment 2 – Individual Greeting Situation Test
Page 6 -line 30. The authors say they expected more fear related behaviours toward strangers: could they
briefly explain why?
Response: We expected our subjects to show more fear related behaviours when alone, because the
ack of social support from pack mates may have resulted in higher stress levels.
Visitors (see also page 3 line 28). Now I understand better the rationale for having several people in each
visitor type (i.e.to minimize the effect of individual differences).
Response: We clarified this in the text, thank you!
Procedures
Page 6 –line 49-50. “Procedures were similar to those of Experiment 1 except for the following
differences”. Why, apart from individual testing, other procedural changes were introduced? For
example, why introducing a third phase to the protocol including it into behavioural analyses. I think a short
explanation for this changes is needed.
Response: This part of text has been restructured and clarified.
The “third phase” was actually present in Experiment 1, only behaviour in this period was not
analysed. As in Experiment 1, after the Passive and Calling phases, the visitor walked into the yard
approximately 15meters, calling and encouraging the animals to stay by her side for 2 minutes. This
phase is presented in the analyses below as the Walking phase in Experiment 2.
Page 7- Behavioural analyses
Same problem as for Experiment 1. Interobserver agreement should be evaluated for all behaviours and
eported in the text.
Response: As stated before, inter observer agreement evaluation has now been added.
Results – Experiment 2. Page 7 line 36: ((
Response: Corrected, thanks!
Conclusions: Conclusions are clearly written well organized. I agree that this study is the first
nvestigating the relationship of intensively socialized hand reared wolves with humans of different types in
a Greeting Situation Test and in investigating the wolf-human relationship going into adulthood. I am not
sure, however that these results can be easily compared with earlier findings on attachment as measured
n the Strange Situation Test: the SST procedure and the the current Greeting Test, either individual or in
group, are quite different in their aims and pick up different aspects of the relationship: attachment and
affiliative behaviour . It also seems to me that “greeting behaviour” after an unwanted separation in an
unfamiliar environment is different from greeting a familiar person met in a very familiar environment.
Response: Yes, we fully agree with this comment, and did our best to make this point throughout the
manuscript, emphasising the difference between both the testing and the phenomenon in question.
Our actual aim was to find a situation OTHER that SST, to test the relationship of our wolves to
humans OTHER than classical attachment. We hope that this is now totally clear in the text.
Thank you again for these most valuable comments!
Appendix C

Dear Reviewer,
Let me thank you again for your evaluation of the revision of our manuscript!
I modified the text again according to your revision suggestions, and described how many times
wolves were tested with each visitor type in Experiment 1.

Comments to the Author(s)
The current manuscript is much improved. There are still some problems with grammar, although mainly
ust dropped articles, and a couple awkward sentences. The only moderate change that still needs to occur
s a bit more detail on how many times each type of visitor was tested in experiment 1 and whether this was
he same for both groups of wolves. If not why?
Otherwise this paper is in a publishable format
More specifics are provided below:
Page 11: line 31 caretaker needs article or plural, same for caretaker in line 32, the before case in line 46
Articles have been added, thanks
Page 12 Line 2 “the” before part
Has been added
Line 17 “ long process of domestication”
As evolutionary processes go domestication was extremely fast
do see your point, long has been deleted
Page 13 Line 35 “ All visitors were young (20-28 years) women, similar in age and sex to the foster
parents” already said all were woman and what does similar in sex mean?
“and sex” has been deleted
Line 41 “in frame” is awkward, maybe…within the frame of?
Has been corrected, thanks
Line 62 “we tested the group with the same visitor type multiple times”
How many times was each visitor type tested, needs to be described in more detail. I think this is saying all
ypes of people were tested and equal number of times, but how many times was this and was it the same
or both groups of wolves. If not why not?
Yes indeed, wolves were tested with all types of visitors equally five times, same for both groups.
nformation has now been added, thank you!
Page 14 line 22 “did not or extremely rarely occurred during the tests” awkward
Line has been rephrased
Page 17 line 5 “to gain more data of each individual” awkward
Line has been rephrased
Line 6-7 “As in Experiment 1, after the Passive and Calling phases, the visitor walked into the yard
approximately 15meters, calling and encouraging the animals to stay by her side for 2 minutes.”
This makes it sound like there was a walking phase in experiment 1, but there was not, according to
experiment 1 methods. Please clarify.
This episode was included into the protocol of Experiment 1 meant to calm the animals after the
greeting episode (Passive and calling phase), however behaviour during this time was not coded in
he first experiment. When conducting the second experiment, we included this period as a third
walking) phase and coded behaviour.
“As in Experiment 1” has been removed to avoid confusion.

Comments to the Author(s)
Overall, the manuscript is a nice extension to Topal et al., showing that the wolves show clear familiarity
preference to a caregiver over varying levels of strangers at 6 months and 12-24 months, although the
exact nature of the relationship across time with the former foster parent is unclear due to methodological
differences across the testing periods. Despite the methodological variability, I found the overall results
nteresting and worthy of publication.
only had a couple of comments in addition to those provided by the other reviewers.
First, in line 8, I’m not sure it’s quite true to what degree the present socialization method "goes far
beyond" other methods. Much of the prior work used the Wolf Park method (Udell, Lord, Hall, etc.), which,
although true the pups weren’t brought into urban environments with foster parents, they were in 24-hour
contact with their primary caregivers.
see the point, and rephrased the sentence.
Second, I found parts of the Experiment 1 method confusing. Line 6 indicates pups were individually
assigned to foster parents, indicating each wolf had a different foster parent. For the group GST, was the
est repeated using each individual foster parent? Did a Foster for one wolf count as a stranger to the other
pups? Was the whole sequence repeated for each individual wolf and foster pair? Were all individuals
coded for each test? I’m a bit confused as to how this test was conducted.
have described how the testing and behaviour coding was done in more detail adding the following
o Exp1/Behavioural analysis
In case of Stranger 1, Stranger 2 and Close acquaintance visits, the behaviour of all four group members were
oded, as their relationship to the visitor was assumed to be the same. In case of the Foster parent visit, only the
behaviour of the individual hand raised by the visitor was coded. Foster parents were not used as any other
visitor type for any other individuals, as the relationship to other (not fostered) individuals varied.”
Thank you for pointing out that this issue was still unclear in the MS!
Also, I tried to look at the raw data to clear up these questions, but the link presented in the paper was not
valid and I didn’t see any supplementary files. Please check the repository link before publication.
am sorry, that the link does not work….I have no idea why that is the case, however, I once again
