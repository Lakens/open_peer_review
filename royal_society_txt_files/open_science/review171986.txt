In this paper, the authors report the humidity sensing using PVA-stabilized Au@Ag and Ag@Au
core@shell nanoparticles and systematically investigate the effect of thickness of the
nanocomposite sample. They found that core@shell bimetallic nanoparticles exhibit higher
sensitivity than Ag or Au monometallic nanoparticles. The results presented in the paper are
interesting and novel.
Unfortunately, however, the paper seriously lacks the elucidation of mechanism of such
observations. In addition, there are several issues which must be addressed as listed below.
Therefore, I could not recommend the paper for publication in the journal as it stands.
(1) The response of the resistance with respect to the relative humidity is totally nonlinear. It is
problematic for practical use. How to solve this problem?
(2) I question reproducibility of their results. It is better to show error bars in the figures which
3
show the relation between %RH and Resistance.
(3) In Figure 2, there is a big difference between Au 4f XPS spectra of Au and Ag@Au
nanoparticles. Please elucidate the reason why such a difference is caused.
(4) Looking at Figure 4(a), the nanoparticles is not Ag@Au core@shell, but they seem more like
Au-Ag alloy.

Dear Dr.Thomas Foley ,
Thank you very much for your email dated 05th February 2018 seeking the
revision of our manuscript entitled “Thickness dependent humidity sensing by PVA
stabilized Au-Ag and Ag-Au core-shell bimetallic nanomorph resistors”. We indeed
appreciate the reviewers for their apt suggestions and affirmative assessment of our
work. We have carefully revised the manuscript by taking into account the points
raised by the reviewers. The modified part of the text (with minor and major
corrections) is highlighted with yellow colour in the revised manuscript. Wherever
felt necessary, specific portions of the revised manuscript are also highlighted with
yellow colour for the swift attention of the reviewers.
We have provided point-wise replies to the comments made by the reviewers.
Looking forward to receiving favorable reply
With warm regards
Sincerely
Prof.Haiwon Lee
Our point-by-point replies to the Reviewers are as follows:
Reviewer : 1
We are grateful to this Reviewer for his compliments and finding our work
commendable.
Reviewer :2
We owe to this Reviewer for finding our work novel and interesting and also for
his proactive suggestions which would surely help in enhancing the scientific
quality of our manuscript. Replies to his comments are as follows:
Comment (1) :The response of the resistance with respect to the relative humidity is
totally nonlinear. It is problematic for practical use. How to solve this problem?
Our Reply:
Due to increase in the humidity, the response in terms of resistance was initially
very fast and the resistance was dropped down from 100000 ohms to 20000 ohms
up to 20 % RH. Subsequently, the resistance changed gradually and further
drop in resistance was observed. Even though it not exactly linear, there has
been consistent pattern with respect to change in resistance which can suffice
limited practical utility. Besides, our studies at the moment are academically
oriented.
Comment (2): I question reproducibility of their results. It is better to show error bars
in the figures which show the relation between %RH and Resistance.
Our Reply:
We have checked the reproducibility of the data 3 times and observed reasonable
consistency in the same. We have used mean values while plotting the figures. It
is opined that showing error bars for closely spaced data values in our studies
can make figures rather clumsy.
Comment (3): In Figure 2, there is a big difference between Au 4f XPS spectra of Au
and Ag@Au nanoparticles. Please elucidate the reason why such a difference is
caused.
Our Reply:
In part agreement with this view-point of the Reviewer, we have appropriately
redrafted the relevant portion of XPS Analysis (Section 3.2) in the revised
manuscript and highlighted the same.
Comment (4): Looking at Figure 4(a), the nanoparticles is not Ag@Au core@shell,
but they seem more like Au-Ag alloy.
Our Reply:
Although atomic number (Z) based contrast difference offered by STEM-
HAADF image normally allows to locate the relative positions of the different
elements, it is difficult to interpret such images in bimetallic core-shell
nanostructures produced by galvanic replacement. We faced this situation in
case of STEM-HAADF image and accompanying elemental mapping data of
Ag(c)Au (s) nanostructures as seen in Fig.4a.The intermixed existence of bright
and gray patches/portions of STEM-HAADF image correspond to mapping
regions of Au(red colour) and Ag(green colour) at some locations only.
Therefore, unequivocal chemical zonation of Ag and Au towards central (core)
and surface (shell) regions could not be noticed in the mapping image of
Ag(c)Au(s) nanomorphs (Fig.4a).At this juncture, it may be recalled that the
pertinent UV-Vis spectral feature reveals predominantly Au like SPR peak
implying Ag(c)Au(s) configuration. Besides, an absence of significant blue-shift
in the SPR peak as well as preponderance of bimetallic core-shell formation in
sequential reduction process weakens the possibility of bimetallic Au-Ag alloy
formation.
Reviewer : 3
We are indebted to this Reviewer for the critical assessment of our key findings
and useful suggestions.
Comment (1): The conclusion about nanostructure of Ag(C)-Au(S) came from UV-
Visible spectroscopy and STEM-HAADF-EELS mapping images is not consistent.
UV-Visible spectroscopy (Fig.1 (c)) shows that there is no Ag/Au alloy in Ag(C)-
Au(S), while mapping images (Fig.4a) shows an opposite result. The Ag components
was not clear from UV-Visible spectroscopy, but there should be some absorption of
Ag there.
Our Reply:

formation.
Comment (2): When compare individual Ag or Au with core-shell nanocomposite
samples, the thickness of these samples should be consistent. It will be better to
include these information.
Our Reply:
We agree with the reviewer. We will carry out the thickness dependent study of
core-shell nanoparticles by changing the concentration of metal salts and would
like to publish it as a separate article.
Comment 3:The result of aging effect is not shown. Too many small figures in the
main text, please combine this small figure according to their types in the main text
for better easy reading.
Our Reply:
We could observe that the sensitivity is persistent even after 5 months and
accordingly made a passing remark about the same in Conclusions section of the
manuscript. Typical aging effect study for the nanocomposite samples is in
progress which will be separately published. Considering the overall
heterogeneous nature of our research, we have provided optimum number of
judiciously combined figures in the main text.

Dear Dr.Thomas Foley ,
Thank you very much for your email dated 13th March 2018 seeking the
second revision of our manuscript entitled “Thickness dependent humidity sensing by
PVA stabilized Au-Ag and Ag-Au core-shell bimetallic nanomorph resistors”. We
indeed appreciate the Reviewer-1 for accepting our reply in toto and Reviewer-2
for accepting almost all the points in our reply. In the light of specific comment
made by Reviewer-2, we have carefully re- revised the manuscript. The modified part
of the text is highlighted with yellow colour in the re-revised manuscript. Wherever
felt necessary, specific portions of the revised manuscript are also highlighted with
green colour for the swift attention of the Reviewers.
Looking forward to receiving favorable reply
With warm regards
Sincerely
Prof.Haiwon Lee
Our Reply to the Comments of the Reviewers are as follows:
Reviewer : 1
We are grateful to this Reviewer for accepting our reply in toto without further
comments.
Reviewer :2
Comment : The authors have NOT addressed my major concern (as shown below) in
my previous comments, while they addressed extra issues I pointed out.
"Unfortunately, however, the paper seriously lacks the elucidation of mechanism of
such observations."
Our Reply:
It is gratifying to note that the Reviewer-2 accepted our point wise replies to the
comments (as provided earlier).
We partially tend to agree with the solo comment of the Reviewer-2 and
accordingly attempted to revise the manuscript with respect to speculative
mechanisms for (i) thickness dependent humidity sensing observations & (ii)
formation of bimetallic nanoprisms and nanocubes. The modified text is
highlighted with yellow colour while the text dealing with humidity sensing
mechanism is highlighted with green-colour in the revised manuscript (for the
swift attention).
