The authors have probed the coevolutionary dynamics of opinon formation and echo chamber
using game theory. Structured by networks, individuals each are characaterized by three traits:
opinion, conformity to opinion of their neighbors, and the benefit of possessing present social
connections. In the evoluitonary process, individuals are able to change both opinion and social
connnection. The evolutionary process advances along the direction of improving fitness.
A simplified genetic algorithm is involved to simulate the evolutionary process. Conditions, or
rather, key parameter ranges, respsonsible for reaching consensus and network division are
obtained. More interestinly, these parameters fit well with the ones derived by considering
realistic data.
The model is clear and point-touching, results interesting, writing proficient, and therefore I
recommend its publication.

label_comment_2
This is a fresh, excellent approach in which the authors consider the coevolution of partisanship
and opinion formation. I really like the core idea and I found the applied technique is sound and
the conclusion is justified. Accordingly, I am very happy to support publication practically in the
present state, but maybe a minor revision would be useful to elevate the presentation of this nice
work.

For this purpose I only have two tiny comments. The first, Fig.1 illustrates a a sort of separation
due to coevolving process. Let me note that similar phenomenon was already observed in EPL 86
(2009) 30007 and in New J. Phys. 11 (2009) 093033. I only mention is because I believe that the
effect discussed by the authors is more general that would be nice to emphasize.
My second comment is technical, unfortunately the reference list is inaccurate, I kindly ask the
authors to revise it for the benefit or readers. For example,
- Ref[8], both volume and page numbers are missing
- Ref[9],[10],[14], page number is missing
- Is it possible to provide links to Ref.[28],[29],[32], and [33]? It would really help the readers.
- Ref.[34] page number and article number are missing
- Ref.[38] article number is missing
- Ref.[39] page number is missing
- Ref.[44] article number is missing
- Ref.[45] probably bad journal name

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
5
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science charge article processing charges for all new
submissions that are accepted for publication. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to
Royal Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers
submitted as part of our collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry
(http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/chemistry).
If your manuscript is newly submitted and subsequently accepted for publication, you will be
asked to pay the article processing charge, unless you request a waiver and this is approved by
Royal Society Publishing. You can find out more about the charges at

Response
Thank you to Reviewer two for their close reading of the paper and their in-
sightful connection of the material with other relevant works. In response to
the first comment, we have added a citation for the two papers mentioned, as
we feel that they do offer greater context to our results. This citation is to be
found in the third paragraph of the results section in the description of figure 1.
In response to the second comment, we have executed the follow alterations
to the bibliography:
• Ref[8], both volume and page numbers are missing - We have added both
numbers.
• Ref[9],[10],[14], page number is missing - The page number has been added
for all except 14, which is published only online without page number.
• Is it possible to provide links to Ref.[28],[29],[32], and [33]? It would really
help the readers. - We have provided links in each case.
• Ref.[34] page number and article number are missing - We have added the
article number. No page number is available in the version accessed.
• Ref.[38] article number is missing - The article number has been added.
• Ref.[39] page number is missing - The article number has been added.
• Ref.[44] article number is missing - The article number has been added.
• Ref.[45] probably bad journal name - The journal title has been corrected.
Thank you again to both reviewers for your careful readings of the paper and
for your insightful commentary.
