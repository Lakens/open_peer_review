This MS reports an analysis of repeatedly measured activity of individual guppies in a
hierarchical sampling design. One element of this analysis that is not entirely novel but
nevertheless useful is that it partitions variation in means as well as variance in residual variance
(or heterogeneous residual variance). Two other aspects of this analysis that are more novel are 1)
taking advantage of the hierarchical sampling of the behavior in bursts to explore nuances of
variance over time and 2) the covariance between individual variation in means and that in
residual variance. The latter is particularly useful because it may allow a better separation of
pattern in residual variance that is circumstantial and pattern that is biological and hence
deserving of explanation. There is much I like about the paper, but I do have some questions, a
few suggestions, and a few quibbles that I think will make the paper more accessible and clearer
for a wide audience.
Title and introduction: Why focus this on behavior? These approaches are generally applicable to
any repeatedly expressed trait, which could include gene expression, physiological measures,
and morphology (e.g., leaves on a tree) in addition to behavior. One advantage of this forum is
the wide audience and I would recommend changing the title and recasting the introduction to
speak more broadly. Obviously the data are on behavior, so you will need to transition to
behavior as an example relatively early. But most of the results don’t really tell us that much
about behavior per se, and the interpretations could be cast more broadly as well.
Line 36: Should be “traits,…, ARE similarly labile.”
Line 42: It is not clear what you mean here by the residual being random. The general assumption
is that it behaves as if it is random, but I don’t think anyone truly thinks that it is produced by
random processes. Moreover, the point you are leading up to isn’t whether or not residual
variance is random, but whether it is homogeneous. One could have heterogeneous residual
variance from totally random processes if there was variation among units in the nature of those
random processes.
Line 43-52: I don’t want to be immodest, but I think this paragraph might be improved by
adopting some of the ideas and even perhaps terminology used in Westneat et al. 2015 (Biol Rev).
There, we explored many of the possible reasons residual variance might have structure. One
slight difficulty I have with clearly understanding the meaning here and elsewhere is the term
“intra-individual variability”. The dominant reason trait expressions vary within individuals is
plasticity. You acknowledge here that unaccounted for plasticity can produce unaccounted
variation within individuals, but it isn’t clear whether you have also considered among-
individual variation in plasticity when discussing individual differences in IIV. Very quickly the
paper assumes that IIV always refers to unaccounted for variance, which is a bit awkward, since
the term IIV is clearly much more general than that. My personal preference would be to use the
phrase “residual variance” since it explicitly focuses on whatever is not in your analysis model.
We do not yet have a general term for a biological component of within-individual variance that
is stochastically generated, but it isn’t clear that’s what you’ve uncovered empirically here
anyway. The Westneat et al. 2015 paper would help navigate all this because it provides a long
3
list of biological processes that generate IIV, with residual variance then being that part of IIV
that is missing from one’s analysis model which could also differ between individuals for the
same reasons, and this would help the non-statistician to understand what you mean here.
Line 53-54: A good example of the confusion that can be generated by the lack of clarity above.
This line to me seemed naïve, although I know the authors are well informed. The reason: we
already have easy, commonly used methods to explore mean-variance covariance in IIV. There is
the covariance between intercept and slope in the behavioral reaction norm approach. Since
random slopes produce IIV, this is already being done. What you want to focus on here is the
covariance between individual mean and individual RESIDUAL VARIANCE in a thoroughly
constructed model that should already have some IIV explained by covariance in random
intercept and slope.
Line 85: Individual differences…HAVE…
Line 88-92: Again, individual differences in IIV do not cause these problems, heterogeneity in
residual variance does. Leaving out random slopes can cause problems with models as well, but
not for the same reasons as leaving out heterogeneous residuals.
Line 173-184: I did not understand why this discussion of BLUPs was included. It implies that the
BLUPs were extracted and analyzed separately, which really isn’t necessary in this case. I note
you do use the BLUPs to check on distributions and so forth, but this could be said in just a line
or two. Perhaps you were trying to explain how the model works, but it threw me off. I might
suggest getting right to the equations.
Line 191: This little nag of general statistical advice probably isn’t necessary and it disrupts the
flow of the methods here. I’d omit it.
Equations 1-4: These are plopped down here seemingly at random. I think they should go near
where they are cited in lines 173-179.
Also, and perhaps extremely importantly, why weren’t random slopes included? Since this is a
potential major source of heterogeneity in residual variance if they are not, then this is a flaw in
your analysis.
Equations 5, 6, and 7: These also need to be moved up closer to where they are cited in line 218-
228.
I have some concerns about these measures of repeatability. I realize that these are the equations
outlined by Araya-Ajoy and Dingemanse, and that they measure certain kinds of repeatability.
But there are some issues. First, it is rather obvious mathematically that short-term repeatability
will be higher than long-term since a variance estimate (in this case, Vbursts) cannot be less than
0. I think a more salient repeatability here would have short term defined as
V(bursts)/V(total) {in a model without individual entered}
Compared with long-term repeatability as
V(individual)/V(total) {in a model without burst entered}
This way long-term repeatability could be either smaller or greater than short-term and there
would then be a reason to be interested in your results an would provide even more justification
for paying attention to the design of your experiment with data collected in bursts.
It is also not clear to me here what Rint is for in this case. It is a repeatability of your ability to
estimate individual intercept values, but this is not the same thing as the repeatability that we
4
want to use for some sort of personality measure. At the least you should carefully parse out why
you want to measure this and make sure that it is not over-interpreted.
Line 252-254: Short-term repeatability is not a measure of IIV, so I am confused by this statement.
Consider the situation if you had measured body length instead of activity. There is no within-
individual variance in body length assuming it doesn’t change much within the time scale of this
study. Variance among individuals would be very high, and measurement error would be the
only source of residual variance, so if your measuring competence was high, that would be very
low. Burst would have no variance, since body size doesn’t change that rapidly. Thus according
to eqn 6, this term would then approach 1. Short-term repeatability is the opposite of IIV.
Line 254-256: This line also seems to contain a slight misinterpretation. Long-term repeatability
does not measure the consistency within individuals, but rather the long-term differences
between individuals given the variance within them. Given your fixed effects, individuals may be
very inconsistent yet if you explain the source of that inconsistency, you would have a high long-
term R.
Line 259: A minor quibble, but technically variation occurs AMONG individuals, differences
occur between. Also, omit hyphen.
Line 261: Omit hyphen.
Line 270-272: The triple use of the word “consistent/cy” here is awkward.
Line 277: Omit hyphen
Line 277-278: I don’t think this is a correct interpretation, or alternatively perhaps equations 5 and
7 are not correct as mentioned above.
Line 284-286: Another subtle quibble here. I don’t think the burst design controls for time. It
controls for clumping of observations within time. Time is already included in the model (Week).
Burst thus accounts for some of the effects of time, but clearly not all of it.
Line 289: variance AMONG individuals, with no hyphen.
Line 289-290: Similar issue here. If time is contributing to variance, then why isn’t WEEK
significant? Perhaps what you mean is that time is a proxy for a variety of potential
environmental influences that may have changed and so create auto-correlation between
observations in time. It might be clearer to state that up front and present the burst design as a
way to assess decays in autocorrelation (which could occur over other gradients besides time).
Line 300-302: I’d put this line (slightly revised) at the beginning of the paragraph so that the
reader knows why all the preceding was included. Certainly your study does not actually
address any of this, but the point about captivity is important. I would suggest that captivity
could also occlude among-individual variance in residual variance. If cues that cause individuals
to switch from consistent to variable activity are missing, then you might have less residual
variation.
Line 311: No hyphen (used only when the hyphenated construct is acting as an adjective or
adverb).
Line 313: Same
5
Line 313-324: I’m not convinced this paragraph is needed. It isn’t clear why habituation would
have any effect on residual variation even if it had occurred, and the transfer of this method to
the field is obvious since it has already been done.
Line 325-367: This is probably the most novel result in the paper and needs to have a more visible
role in the discussion. The covariance is negative which is opposite the normal positive mean-
variance relationship, except that you transformed the data under the assumption that it would
eliminate any mathematical association between mean and variance. This assumption is
discussed in the next paragraph, so all of this could probably be moved up higher in the
discussion.
Line 345-346: I think there something wrong in this sentence as it does not seem to make sense.
Line 356-359: I had two comments on this sentence. First, just to beat a dead horse, plasticity of
course creates intra-individual variation, so it is technically circular or obvious to say that more
plastic individuals have more IIV. I think what you mean is that more plastic individuals may
have more deviations from their reaction norms, which produces more residual variation. You
don’t really explain why, but this is a well-documented prediction in the plasticity literature. For
example, DeWitt et al. (1998) list developmental instability as a cost to plasticity, and Tonsor et al.
(2013, Evolution) make this idea a central focus of their study.

This is a nice work quantifying intra-individual variation, called predictability in the work
(Cleasby et al 2015 MEE), which the authors builds their work upon. I think this work is sound
and the paper is well written generally. I have several comments to improve this manuscript.
Line 218-236: It feels that Equations 5-7 are misplaced. I think it is much better to introduce and
explain them each at a time (need more explanations of these different kinds of ICCs).
Line 238-243: I would encourage the author to put a plot. See this paper, which has what I kind of
want.

Line 244-247: It is hard to figure out whether these values are large or small. I would recommend
the authors present some visual presentation of this. In evolutionary quantitative genetics papers,
people often present a bar graphs of % of each variance components. Or presenting CV may be a
good idea here, which relates to my next comment.
Line 253-254: “moderately high (R short-term = 0.56 [0.48, 254 0.64]), which can be interpreted
as a standardised metric of mean IIV.” I am not sure this quite is correct. This is just
repeatability. The authors should report standardized IIV (or predictability). Cleasby et al.
propose CV[P] (coefficient of variation in predictability; their Equation 17) to be present for
general comparison across studies on predictability (or IIV) so I urge the authors to present it and
also encourage the future studies on predictability to do so.
For acceptance, the authors should provide all the relevant code with good annotation, it is
preferable that authors put the code in online depository like github, Figshare or OSF (Open

general comparison across studies on predictability (or IIV) so I urge the authors to present it and
also encourage the future studies on predictability to do so.

This study of guppy activity levels uses two helpful approaches to assess variability in this
example of a labile trait. First, it employs a burst sampling design which allows for quantitative
assessment of how timing in sampling influences the repeatability of individual mean activity
levels. Second, and more importantly, it uses a double GLM to investigate among-individual
variance in residual variances, and adds in covariance between individual residual variance and
mean activity. This is an important step forward, and overall, the paper does a good job of adding
to the call for more modeling of pattern in residual variance.
I had a number of concerns with the previous version of the MS, and this version is much
improved. I have a few comments, most of which are relatively minor.
I am still uncomfortable with how “intra-individual variability” is used, but I know you are
invested in it so I will belabor the point only briefly. I’d actually be fine with it if it referred to all
within-individual variation, explained and unexplained, as that is what the words actually mean,
and would still prefer “residual variance” over IIV, but I think “unexplained IIV” is best
throughout as “residual IIV” is slightly awkward. The issue here though is to be clear about what
you are referencing. Throughout the paper, you still use IIV in places where you really mean
residual variation, and so it is just confusing (to me) despite the disclaimer about this at the
beginning. That disclaimer is odd—imagine stepping up one level and using plain old
“variation” throughout. This illustrates the problem—“variance” would be way too crude, and in
parallel, the term “IIV” isn’t being used at the appropriate level of specificity. I urge you to look
at each use of “IIV” and ask whether you are referring to this as a general concept (all intra-
individual variation), or as the residual variance in your specific model. If it is the latter, at least
use either “residual IIV” or preferably, “unexplained IIV” in every instance.
Line 187-191: I don’t understand this section—it seems more complicated than it needs to be.
Burst is simply a nested random effect. If it was coded in SAS, I would have done the two as
follows:
Random intercept/subject = ID;
14
Random intercept/Subject = Burst(ID);
Since presumably no individual experienced the burst of sampling of another individual
(depending on how burst was coded), the latter statement is equivalent to:
Random ID*Burst;
All this stuff about a new variable with 294 individual by burst levels seems unnecessary and a
bit confusing.
I have no major problems with the revision of the repeatability. Very thought-provoking
responses too. My only quibble is that given the necessary mathematical bias in comparing short-
term and long-term repeatability, how does one interpret the comparison? In your case, you
interpreted a drop in repeatability from R(short-term) = 0.56 to R(long-term) = 0.31 to be a shift
from “moderately high” to “low”. On what basis? Also, it might be useful to present the
estimated variance for ID so the reader can compare it to the burst*ID variance you provide on
line 270.

Comments to the Author(s)
This MS reports an analysis of repeatedly measured activity of individual guppies in a
hierarchical sampling design. One element of this analysis that is not entirely novel but
nevertheless useful is that it partitions variation in means as well as variance in residual
variance (or heterogeneous residual variance). Two other aspects of this analysis that are
more novel are 1) taking advantage of the hierarchical sampling of the behavior in bursts to
explore nuances of variance over time and 2) the covariance between individual variation in
means and that in residual variance. The latter is particularly useful because it may allow a
better separation of pattern in residual variance that is circumstantial and pattern that is
biological and hence deserving of explanation. There is much I like about the paper, but I do
have some questions, a few suggestions, and a few quibbles that I think will make the paper
more accessible and clearer for a wide audience.
>> Thanks for the encouraging and positive reaction to our work; thanks also for taking
considerable time to provide us with an insightful review!
Title and introduction: Why focus this on behavior? These approaches are generally
applicable to any repeatedly expressed trait, which could include gene expression,
physiological measures, and morphology (e.g., leaves on a tree) in addition to behavior. One
advantage of this forum is the wide audience and I would recommend changing the title and
recasting the introduction to speak more broadly. Obviously the data are on behavior, so you
will need to transition to behavior as an example relatively early. But most of the results
don't really tell us that much about behavior per se, and the interpretations could be cast
more broadly as well.
>> Thanks for this suggestion! We’ve re-focussed the first paragraph to emphasise the
generality of the methodology before transitioning the focus to behaviour. We’ve
substituted “behavioural traits” for “labile traits” in the title. We also draw the introduction
back to broader fields in giving examples from non-behavioural traits (line 54-55) and use
broader terminology when discussing sampling regimes (lines 61-78). Finally, we also point
out in the abstract the general applicability of the methods discussed in this paper.
Line 36: Should be "traits,., ARE similarly labile."
>> Corrected as suggested. (see line 47)
Line 42: It is not clear what you mean here by the residual being random. The general
assumption is that it behaves as if it is random, but I don't think anyone truly thinks that it is
produced by random processes. Moreover, the point you are leading up to isn't whether or
not residual variance is random, but whether it is homogeneous. One could have
heterogeneous residual variance from totally random processes if there was variation
among units in the nature of those random processes.
>> We removed the first sentence of this paragraph as the reviewer is correct, we are more
interested in whether the variation is homogenous.
Line 43-52: I don't want to be immodest, but I think this paragraph might be improved by
adopting some of the ideas and even perhaps terminology used in Westneat et al. 2015 (Biol
Rev). There, we explored many of the possible reasons residual variance might have
structure. One slight difficulty I have with clearly understanding the meaning here and
elsewhere is the term "intra-individual variability". The dominant reason trait expressions
vary within individuals is plasticity. You acknowledge here that unaccounted for plasticity
can produce unaccounted variation within individuals, but it isn't clear whether you have
also considered among-individual variation in plasticity when discussing individual
differences in IIV.
>> Yes, we do very carefully consider this, and make this point in the introduction (line 73-
75). This lead us to design a very tight and controlled experiment to avoid unwanted
systematic variation that might confound individual differences in residual intra-individual
variation. We make this clear by controlling social cues (lines 134-136), keeping temperature
within a small temperature range (further clarified on lines 148-152) and acclimated fish for
1-2 nights (line 131). Finally, we control for time related change as bursts, which acts as a
proxy for internal and external environment (discussed further below).
Very quickly the paper assumes that IIV always refers to unaccounted for variance, which is a
bit awkward, since the term IIV is clearly much more general than that. My personal
preference would be to use the phrase "residual variance" since it explicitly focuses on
whatever is not in your analysis model. We do not yet have a general term for a biological
component of within-individual variance that is stochastically generated, but it isn't clear
that's what you've uncovered empirically here anyway.
>> We agree there is considerable potential confusion in the nomenclature surrounding
IIV/predictability/residual variance etc. in the literature. The term IIV and our working
definition (as used in cited literature, discussed below) is now brought forward to the first
paragraph. We now use “residual intra-individual variability (IIV) to make this clearer and
state “hereafter termed IIV” (line 39), and further clarify the term to say “IIV is typically
viewed as short-term unpredictable fluctuations in an individual’s trait scores in a given
context” (line 53-54) and cite the Stamps’ review (below).
The Westneat et al. 2015 paper would help navigate all this because it provides a long list of
biological processes that generate IIV, with residual variance then being that part of IIV that
is missing from one's analysis model which could also differ between individuals for the same
reasons, and this would help the non-statistician to understand what you mean here.
>> The potential confusion is why we were careful in defining IIV, but clearly as you suggest
we can do even better! Again, using “residual intra-individual variability (IIV)”, with the
added clarification above should fix this problem.
>> Further, using this terminology matches with previously used definitions as: “Short-term
unpredictable fluctuations in within-individual behaviour, often assumed to result from
spontaneous fluctuations in internal state” (Stamps 2015 Biol. Rev. 10.1111/brv.12186),
which goes back in the ecology literature to Stamps et al.’s (2012 Anim. Behav) paper,
where they borrowed the established term (with a similar definition) from a longer history
of use in the psychology literature (e.g. MacDonald et al. 2006 Trends Neurosci). The term
also mirrors the equivalent and similarly used term “intra-genotypic variability (IGV)” (e.g.
Ayroles et al. 2015 PNAS).
>> On a broader note, we question if the term “residual variance” is the best, for several
reasons: (1) we think that the term ‘residual variance’ frames the issue as a statistical one,
whereas the term IIV better frames the focus as a biological parameter, (2) the suggested
term does not differentiate between different levels of biological assortment, e.g. intra-
genotypic variation would also be ‘residual variance’. Heterogeneity in residual variance is
simply unequal variances at your lowest level of sampling units. Although, in a certain sense
of the word, a BLUP prediction is a ‘residual’ deviation from the predicted fixed effect, or in
the case of burst from the ID random effect, and (3) related to 2, the suggested term
becomes verbose and cumbersome to later differentiate these different hierarchical levels
of phenotypic variation, and among-individual variation in residual variance from changes in
residual variance due to environmental contexts, treatments etc. This concern is particularly
apt when defining appropriate search terms or keywords and making the literature
accessible.
>> The other alternative term (though not suggested) is ‘predictability’ (e.g. Cleasby, Briffa,
Biro and others). While at times appropriate in the contexts previously used, the term
implies a function. Something (e.g. predator or social partner, but presumably more than
the statistical model) is trying to make a prediction on the individual’s expressed phenotype.
All of this is to say we think that the term ‘IIV’ to be the best established of the options, with
the greatest familiarity and clarity to the broadest audience in identifying the patterns and
level of assortment we are talking about.
>> We do however wish to take on this critique of the term IIV and have clarified and more
explicitly stated our working definition of IIV (see lines 38-39), and in the areas where the
reviewer points out the nomenclature may be particularly confusing, we prefix in
parentheses “(residual) IIV” (line 79, 342, 391).
>> As to the more important ideas raised in your paper, we are familiar with the paper and
it was an oversight to not cite it. Previous iterations of the manuscript had, though it was
removed as we edited without realising! This particular paragraph however, speaks to the
commonality of IIV varying among-individuals and empirical evidence for this, not why this
would be the case. The citation is now added in other sections where valuable (see lines 40,
75, 348), particularly in drawing the analogue to developmental instability and organismal
error.
Line 53-54: A good example of the confusion that can be generated by the lack of clarity
above. This line to me seemed naïve, although I know the authors are well informed. The
reason: we already have easy, commonly used methods to explore mean-variance
covariance in IIV. There is the covariance between intercept and slope in the behavioral
reaction norm approach. Since random slopes produce IIV, this is already being done. What
you want to focus on here is the covariance between individual mean and individual
RESIDUAL VARIANCE in a thoroughly constructed model that should already have some IIV
explained by covariance in random intercept and slope.
>> Good point. Changed at beginning of paragraph to explicitly state “(residual) IIV” (line
79), as well as defining it in the first paragraph.
Line 85: Individual differences.HAVE.
>> Changed, thanks!
Line 88-92: Again, individual differences in IIV do not cause these problems, heterogeneity in
residual variance does. Leaving out random slopes can cause problems with models as well,
but not for the same reasons as leaving out heterogeneous residuals.
>> See responses above; line 79 uses ‘(residual) IIV’ now to further clarify.
Line 173-184: I did not understand why this discussion of BLUPs was included. It implies that
the BLUPs were extracted and analyzed separately, which really isn't necessary in this case. I
note you do use the BLUPs to check on distributions and so forth, but this could be said in
just a line or two. Perhaps you were trying to explain how the model works, but it threw me
off. I might suggest getting right to the equations.
>> Yes, good suggestion. The paragraph is now deleted and previous paragraph (lines 182-
191) is edited to define subscripts.
Line 191: This little nag of general statistical advice probably isn't necessary and it disrupts
the flow of the methods here. I'd omit it.
>> We have deleted this sentence as suggested.
Equations 1-4: These are plopped down here seemingly at random. I think they should go
near where they are cited in lines 173-179.
>> Absolutely. We moved them to line 197-201.
Also, and perhaps extremely importantly, why weren't random slopes included? Since this is
a potential major source of heterogeneity in residual variance if they are not, then this is a
flaw in your analysis.
>> This is a major potential source as suggested, but we do in fact do the equivalent of this
in our model: the burst modelling has an equivalency to a random (categorical) slope of
time, and it is even more flexible as it does not assume linearity of change through time.
This should act as a proxy for much of the natural error fluctuating through time (e.g. small
fluctuations in water chemistry). If Westneat is not referring to the random effect of time,
but rather slope effect with respect to temperature, we found that for the fixed effect of
temperature, the variation was tiny (23.8-25.6C), and the fixed effect was clearly
inconsequential and actually negative (line 263). The range of temperature values any
specific individual experienced was even smaller (median = 0.65°C, max = 1.3°C), and that
small variation an individual experienced was largely collinear with the burst effect (within
burst range: median = 0.2°C, max = 1.1°C). We have added these ranges (lines 145-150). The
inclusion of a random slope of temperature therefore made little biological sense a priori.
To further convince ourselves of this, we ran the model and values did not meaningfully
change with the residual SD (exp(<U+03B3>0)) at the intercept, decreasing by only 0.01, and the
among-individual standard deviation remaining unchanged (<U+03C9> = 0.42).
Equations 5, 6, and 7: These also need to be moved up closer to where they are cited in line
218-228.
>> Yes, we agree! They have been moved forward to lines 245, 255-257.
I have some concerns about these measures of repeatability. I realize that these are the
equations outlined by Araya-Ajoy and Dingemanse, and that they measure certain kinds of
repeatability. But there are some issues. First, it is rather obvious mathematically that short-
term repeatability will be higher than long-term since a variance estimate (in this case,
Vbursts) cannot be less than 0. I think a more salient repeatability here would have short
term defined as
V(bursts)/V(total) {in a model without individual entered} Compared with long-term
repeatability as
V(individual)/V(total) {in a model without burst entered}
This way long-term repeatability could be either smaller or greater than short-term and
there would then be a reason to be interested in your results an would provide even more
justification for paying attention to the design of your experiment with data collected in
bursts.
>> Yes, we agree it is a foregone conclusion that short-term repeatability is larger than long-
term repeatability as all variances are positive definite. However, that is not to say they are
uninformative and their significance is now more clearly stated in lines 246-251. Specifically,
short-term repeatability allows is to speaks to the consistency of scores within a short time-
frame within bursts. Long-term shows the overall consistency of scores expressed over the
course of the 3 weeks of observations.
>> Firstly, the suggestion to use V(burst)/V(total) (in a burst random intercept only model) is
equivalent to the short-term repeatability that we calculate, because the individual variation
is then pooled into burst effect. Bursts are an interaction effect between time (week -
categorical) and ID (as stated on line 185-186, and term changed in text to ID*Burst to refer
to this parameter). To draw the analogy to a simple two-way (2x2) ANOVA, it is equivalent
to reducing the model down to a one-way ANOVA with four groups. The residual and
explained variance stays the same. To reassure ourselves of this, we simulated burst
sampled data and arrived at the same conclusion.
>> Secondly, the suggestion to use V(ID)/V(total) (in a model ignoring burst) as ‘long term’
repeatability is potentially violating statistical assumptions if the effect of burst is strong,
relative to the size of residual variance. It is also still a foregone conclusion that this
model/equation would always yield a lower R than the above model/equation. For these
reasons, we prefer to continue with the use of eqns 5-7 as these prescribed equations by
Araya-Ajoy et al. offer the most parsimonious evaluation of these patterns, from a single
model.
It is also not clear to me here what Rint is for in this case. It is a repeatability of your ability
to estimate individual intercept values, but this is not the same thing as the repeatability
that we want to use for some sort of personality measure. At the least you should carefully
parse out why you want to measure this and make sure that it is not over-interpreted.
>> R(int) represents the consistency of individual differences through time, the degree to
which individuals’ predicted values intersect as a function of time. This is equivalent to
Brommer’s (2013 Behav Ecol Sociobiol, 10.1007/s00265-013-1603-9) ‘cross-context
correlation’ where the context is time. This is really what we are interested in when we
study ‘personality’, as personality is defined as individual differences (predicted means) that
are maintained through time and across contexts. By contrast, the traditional ‘repeatability’
is the within individual consistency of scores, which is (subtly) something different. We now
add this brief justification on lines 240-244 with citation of Brommer.
>> The point is, one could therefore have strong consistency of scores from observation to
observation, though no maintenance of mean values over time. To use your example below,
if some individuals grow over the intervals between bursts while others do not, you would
have high time-specific R, but the individual differences in body length would not be
maintained, giving low R(int). So while the traditional R values speak to consistency of
scores, this equation explicitly asks whether these individual differences are maintained
through time.
>> Finally, the model should be robust to imprecision in measuring the mean within a burst
with respect to sample size, and that imprecision in estimating each burst BLUPs value
should reduce the precision in estimating the hyper-parameter explaining the burst variance
(increase the credible distribution) and thus of the R(int) value. That is to say, R(int) is a
biologically meaningful term and not a function of the “ability” to estimate the individual
intercept.
Line 252-254: Short-term repeatability is not a measure of IIV, so I am confused by this
statement. Consider the situation if you had measured body length instead of activity. There
is no within-individual variance in body length assuming it doesn't change much within the
time scale of this study. Variance among individuals would be very high, and measurement
error would be the only source of residual variance, so if your measuring competence was
high, that would be very low. Burst would have no variance, since body size doesn't change
that rapidly. Thus according to eqn 6, this term would then approach 1. Short-term
repeatability is the opposite of IIV.
>> Reference to mean IIV is deleted (see line 277).
Line 254-256: This line also seems to contain a slight misinterpretation. Long-term
repeatability does not measure the consistency within individuals, but rather the long-term
differences between individuals given the variance within them. Given your fixed effects,
individuals may be very inconsistent yet if you explain the source of that inconsistency, you
would have a high long-term R.
>> We have now re-phrased to clarify: “By contrast, consistency of scores within individuals
without taking account of any time related change… “ (See line 278-279).
Line 259: A minor quibble, but technically variation occurs AMONG individuals, differences
occur between. Also, omit hyphen.
>> Changed, thanks.
Line 261: Omit hyphen.
>> Changed as suggested.
Line 270-272: The triple use of the word "consistent/cy" here is awkward.
>> We have changed the second two uses (line 294-297).
Line 277: Omit hyphen
>> Changed as suggested.
Line 277-278: I don't think this is a correct interpretation, or alternatively perhaps equations
5 and 7 are not correct as mentioned above.
>> Please see discussion above. This line has been edited to note these differences are
“substantial” to better draw focus on magnitude of change, rather than whether or not
there is a change.
Line 284-286: Another subtle quibble here. I don't think the burst design controls for time. It
controls for clumping of observations within time. Time is already included in the model
(Week). Burst thus accounts for some of the effects of time, but clearly not all of it.
>> The effect of week evaluates mean level change in the population’s behaviour as a
directional effect. The effect of burst is analogous to temporal reaction norms, except the
sampling design is setup to make time categorical. As variation in temporal reaction norms
can be interpreted as an individual by time interaction, the definition of burst is setup the
same way (line 187). Confusion may arise in the use of ‘burst’ to describe the number of
intensive bouts of sampling (1,2,3) compared to the random effect ‘burst’ that is the
ID*burst categorical variable that identifies bursts for each individual. For this reason, when
talking about that effect throughout the manuscript, we refer to it as ID*Burst.
>> As temporal reaction norms are used to control for time related change, the idea is an
analogue with burst sampling. Each have limitations which make them a fairly coarse control
for time, and as you elude to, there is potentially time related change within a burst. The
limitation of reaction norms as pointed out in the MS is that they either assume linearity, or
are definable by some general equation structure (e.g. y ~ ln(time), which may occur as
acclimation/habituation effects taper off with time). Temporal reaction norms fail to
account for the lack of temporal independence which should not be expected to follow any
specific function and is likely the case under the hypothesis of slowly-changing endogenous
and exogenous states. This either needs to be modelled with burst sampling as discussed in
this paper, or through temporal autocorrelation where data can be collected in an
appropriately and relatively evenly spaced time intervals (e.g. Nakayama et al. 2016 Behav
Ecol 10.1093/beheco/arw090).
Line 289: variance AMONG individuals, with no hyphen.
>> changed as suggested.
Line 289-290: Similar issue here. If time is contributing to variance, then why isn't WEEK
significant? Perhaps what you mean is that time is a proxy for a variety of potential
environmental influences that may have changed and so create auto-correlation between
observations in time. It might be clearer to state that up front and present the burst design
as a way to assess decays in autocorrelation (which could occur over other gradients besides
time).
>> Week has no directional effect on the population level (see lines 265 where we present
the results.). The effect of time is heterogeneous among individuals; some increase their
scores from one burst to the next, some decrease their score. So yes, as stated above these
temporal trends could be due to heterogeneous responses to unquantified external stimuli
or endogenous effects.
>> We now include a figure to show the temporal reaction norms arising from the ‘burst’
modelling of time related change that highlights this point. We have now added plots of
temporal trends by ID in Fig. 1d to visualise this.
Line 300-302: I'd put this line (slightly revised) at the beginning of the paragraph so that the
reader knows why all the preceding was included. Certainly your study does not actually
address any of this, but the point about captivity is important. I would suggest that captivity
could also occlude among-individual variance in residual variance. If cues that cause
individuals to switch from consistent to variable activity are missing, then you might have
less residual variation.
>> Good suggestion. First half of sentence moved to topic sentence, second half retained at
end (line 370).
Line 311: No hyphen (used only when the hyphenated construct is acting as an adjective or
adverb).
>> Hyphen removed, thanks!
Line 313: Same
>> Hyphen removed, thanks!
Line 313-324: I'm not convinced this paragraph is needed. It isn't clear why habituation
would have any effect on residual variation even if it had occurred, and the transfer of this
method to the field is obvious since it has already been done.
>> Paragraph removed as suggested.
Line 325-367: This is probably the most novel result in the paper and needs to have a more
visible role in the discussion. The covariance is negative which is opposite the normal positive
mean-variance relationship, except that you transformed the data under the assumption
that it would eliminate any mathematical association between mean and variance. This
assumption is discussed in the next paragraph, so all of this could probably be moved up
higher in the discussion.
>> We have now moved as a block of four paragraphs (discussing covariance matrices) to
follow the discussion of burst sampling. Now is third paragraph, starting line 315.
Line 345-346: I think there something wrong in this sentence as it does not seem to make
sense.
>> Sentence removed.
Line 356-359: I had two comments on this sentence. First, just to beat a dead horse,
plasticity of course creates intra-individual variation, so it is technically circular or obvious to
say that more plastic individuals have more IIV. I think what you mean is that more plastic
individuals may have more deviations from their reaction norms, which produces more
residual variation.
>> Changed to reiterate residual IIV
You don't really explain why, but this is a well-documented prediction in the plasticity
literature. For example, DeWitt et al. (1998) list developmental instability as a cost to
plasticity, and Tonsor et al.
(2013, Evolution) make this idea a central focus of their study.
>> We have added citations to the suggested papers to frame the source for contextual
plasticity-residual IIV covariance eluded to into “organismal error” (line 346-352).

Towards powerful experimental and statistical approaches to study behavioural intra-
individual variation
This is a nice work quantifying intra-individual variation, called predictability in the work
(Cleasby et al 2015 MEE), which the authors builds their work upon. I think this work is sound
and the paper is well written generally. I have several comments to improve this manuscript.
>> Thank you for your supportive feedback.
Line 218-236: It feels that Equations 5-7 are misplaced. I think it is much better to introduce
and explain them each at a time (need more explanations of these different kinds of ICCs).
>> We have moved the equations forward as suggested, and clarified their significance (line
197-201).
Line 238-243: I would encourage the author to put a plot. See this paper, which has what I
kind of want.

>> The fixed effect parameters are not all on the same scale, and therefore unfortunately
cannot be directly compared visually in such a caterpillar plot.
Line 244-247: It is hard to figure out whether these values are large or small. I would
recommend the authors present some visual presentation of this. In evolutionary
quantitative genetics papers, people often present a bar graphs of % of each variance
components. Or presenting CV may be a good idea here, which relates to my next comment.
>> The data is z-transformed, so the variances of the individual intercepts, bursts intercepts,
residuals and that explained by the fixed effects sum to 1. Therefore the variances of these
terms are proportions of the overall variation in scores of the dataset. We now state this
more explicitly on lines 204-205. The proportional importance after accounting for the fixed
effects is then also given by the repeatability estimates. Further addition of terms, formulae
and calculations we fear may serve to confuse in what is already a statistically saturated
paper.
Line 253-254: "moderately high (R short-term = 0.56 [0.48,
254 0.64]), which can be interpreted as a standardised metric of mean IIV."
I am not sure this quite is correct. This is just repeatability. The authors should report
standardized IIV (or predictability). Cleasby et al. propose CV[P] (coefficient of variation in
predictability; their Equation 17) to be present for general comparison across studies on
predictability (or IIV) so I urge the authors to present it and also encourage the future studies
on predictability to do so.
>> We have now included CV[P] on line 284 and defined it in the statistical methods in lines
251-254 including the formula (Eqn. 8, line 257). It is important to note however, CV[P]
speaks to the among-individual variation in IIV, not the mean of IIV, which we point out in
defining the term.
>> We have deleted the statement of R(short-term) being a standard metric of mean IIV.
For acceptance, the authors should provide all the relevant code with good annotation, it is
preferable that authors put the code in online depository like github, Figshare or OSF (Open
Science Framework); these depositories allow author updating. The Stan, Jags, R code
snippets will be useful for future studies.
>> We wholeheartedly agree and a key aim of this paper is to increase the accessibility of
this form of analysis. We intend to publish the code and data alongside the MS as
supplements (see Supplementary material) to make them as visible and accessible as
possible. We have also added the goodness of fit diagnostic code from the previous version
submitted.
>> We appreciate your thoughts, support and feedback.
Comments to the Author(s)
This study of guppy activity levels uses two helpful approaches to assess variability in this
example of a labile trait. First, it employs a burst sampling design which allows for
quantitative assessment of how timing in sampling influences the repeatability of individual
mean activity levels. Second, and more importantly, it uses a double GLM to investigate
among-individual variance in residual variances, and adds in covariance between individual
residual variance and mean activity. This is an important step forward, and overall, the
paper does a good job of adding to the call for more modeling of pattern in residual
variance.
I had a number of concerns with the previous version of the MS, and this version is much
improved. I have a few comments, most of which are relatively minor.
I am still uncomfortable with how “intra-individual variability” is used, but I know you are
invested in it so I will belabor the point only briefly. I’d actually be fine with it if it referred to
all within-individual variation, explained and unexplained, as that is what the words actually
mean, and would still prefer “residual variance” over IIV, but I think “unexplained IIV” is best
throughout as “residual IIV” is slightly awkward. The issue here though is to be clear about
what you are referencing. Throughout the paper, you still use IIV in places where you really
mean residual variation, and so it is just confusing (to me) despite the disclaimer about this
at the beginning. That disclaimer is odd—imagine stepping up one level and using plain old
“variation” throughout. This illustrates the problem—“variance” would be way too crude,
and in parallel, the term “IIV” isn’t being used at the appropriate level of specificity. I urge
you to look at each use of “IIV” and ask whether you are referring to this as a general
concept (all intra-individual variation), or as the residual variance in your specific model. If it
is the latter, at least use either “residual IIV” or preferably, “unexplained IIV” in every
instance.
>> We now use the acronym ‘rIIV’ throughout the MS to denote ‘residual intra-individual
variability’.
Line 187-191: I don’t understand this section—it seems more complicated than it needs to
be. Burst is simply a nested random effect. If it was coded in SAS, I would have done the two
as follows:
Random intercept/subject = ID;
Random intercept/Subject = Burst(ID);
Since presumably no individual experienced the burst of sampling of another individual
(depending on how burst was coded), the latter statement is equivalent to:
Random ID*Burst;
>> Indeed, this is a nested effect. The easiest way to code this in Stan (or JAGS) is to create a
new dummy variable which represents the interaction between ID & Burst. We chose to
explain it as such to make mapping the statistical methods section onto the supplementary
code as easy as possible.
>> We have now first referred to it as being nested, before explaining the dummy variable
for those using the sample code.
All this stuff about a new variable with 294 individual by burst levels seems unnecessary and
a bit confusing.
>> Clarification above should fix any confusion.
I have no major problems with the revision of the repeatability. Very thought-provoking
responses too. My only quibble is that given the necessary mathematical bias in comparing
short-term and long-term repeatability, how does one interpret the comparison? In your
case, you interpreted a drop in repeatability from R(short-term) = 0.56 to R(long-term) = 0.31
to be a shift from “moderately high” to “low”. On what basis? Also, it might be useful to
present the estimated variance for ID so the reader can compare it to the burst*ID variance
you provide on line 270.
>> Among-individual SDs of each the ID*burst and ID terms are already given on lines 270-
271.
>> Yes, the magnitude of change is somewhat subjective at the moment, given few studies
have thus far used this form of sampling. The sentence makes the point that R estimates are
contingent on the period of time considered, which is underappreciated in many studies.
Line 349: What is meant by behavioural and physiological scope?
>> Rephrased to talk about being constrained in the range of scores they may express (line
349-351)
Line 352: Perhaps should be “Theoretical models OF plasticity…”
>> Yes, thanks!
