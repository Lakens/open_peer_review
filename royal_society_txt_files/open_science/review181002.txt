General comments
This manuscript provides the first report of habitual stone-tool use by Cebus capucinus imitator
on island habitats in Coiba National Park, a valuable discovery. Cebus sp have not been known
to be tool users despite widespread tool use in the closely related Sapajus. The emergence of
stone-tool-use behavior specifically on island habitats rich in tool materials and encased food
species, further parallels patterns of habitual stone-tool use by island populations of Burmese
long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis aurea), especially since M fascicularis are also not
known tool users. Based on the authors' observations via surveys and camera trap recordings,
tool use appears to be confined to one island, Jicarón in particular, despite the availability of
associated foods and tool materials on two other islands in CNP that are also inhabited by
capuchins (although this is not entirely convincing to me, and I make several queries below). Tool
use also appears to be a behavioral specialization of male individuals. Further study of this
behavior thus has significant potential to contribute comparative data for understanding the
biological, ecological, and social drivers of the emergence of foraging specializations,
technological innovation, and cultural transmission in primates.
The authors have made an admirable effort to study a rare behavior in unhabituated primates
under challenging field conditions (I fully sympathize with the difficulties of working
with/against the tides!). Mostly, I think the manuscript would benefit from clearer explanations
of the rationales behind some of the methods, more detailed reporting of the data obtained, and a
stronger discussion of some of the findings and implications of the research. I provide some
suggestions below.
Comments on specific sections:
1) Introduction
a) I might suggest some restructuring of the introduction and discussion. The bulk of the
introduction is composed of a review of current explanations for the emergence and maintenance
of tool use traditions, and how these have been used to account for differences in the prevalence
of tool use by Cebus and Sapajus. It is an excellent discussion, but when reading the manuscript, I
felt that this introduction somewhat overstates the focus of the report.
The behavior reported in this paper will certainly lend itself well to testing many of these
hypotheses, but the current report provides only preliminary descriptions of the behavior based
on nonsystematic camera trap records. The authors could consider a more concise and
representative introduction, saving these sections for the discussion, and adding specific
suggestions on how further studies might test these outstanding hypotheses.
2) Study Site
a) Differences in plant diversity are reported - are there any data on potential differences in the
abundance of species associated with tool use (sea almonds, coconuts)?
b) What about differences in the availability of marine invertebrates? This and the above can
inform on patterns of resource selection by capuchins vis-à-vis tool use, i.e. are they utilizing
foods in accordance with availability, or might tools be used to exploit less abundant (but
possibly higher quality) foods.
3
c) Can the authors provide any data on the capuchin populations on these islands (density,
number of groups, number of individuals)?
d) Some description of anthropogenic impact on each island would be good. Are there differences
in anthropogenic impact/disturbance on each island? This can affect tool use (e.g. van Schaik's
"Fragility of Traditions"; Gumert &Malaivijitnond, 2012, Oryx)
3) Coastal surveys
a) How many surveys were done?
b) Did surveys take into account when the monkeys last visited the area before high/low tides?
As the authors mention, tidal action can erase evidence of tool use.
c) Lines 225-226 - It seems like the authors focus disproportionately on sea almonds in their island
surveys and in their selection of camera trap sites, and I wonder what the rationale is for this,
since they might be missing much of tool use on marine invertebrates.
d) Lines 226-228 - were the number of used-tool sites and the types of foods processed at each site
recorded? If so, could the authors provide data on the relative prevalence of food types processed
with tools (perhaps in the findings section)? This would also help to clarify my preceding
comment, e.g. if marine invertebrates comprised only a small proportion of foods processed,
there might be more reason to focus on T catappa to capture more observations (although tool
use on other foods should not be ignored in future more systematic studies).
4) Camera trapping effort
a) Camera trapping effort is not equal across islands relative to island size. Could the authors
provide a more detailed explanation of their rationale for this? In Findings lines 276-277, it is
reported that initial camera trapping failed to return evidence of stone-tool use on Coiba and
Rancharía, but there were only 5 total camera traps deployed on these islands combined vs 30 on
Jicarón. It could be that tool use happens on these two islands but more rarely, and a lower
sampling effort further reduces the chances of observing it.
b) How were sites selected - were they simply placed at all T catappa groves? If so, that would
mean that Jicarón has a much higher T catappa density, then it would be important to discuss this
as a possible ecological driver of tool use.
c) Could tool use also take place where there are no T catappa but there are marine invertebrates,
i.e. is it possible that camera trapping effort was insufficient to capture non- T catappa tool use?
5) Findings
a) Lines 262-271 - Please report data on how many tool use sites were found, how many
instances/bouts (i.e. number of foods processed) of tool use were recorded, and any other data
you can provide about the proportion of tool use that were in different habitat types / on
different food types.
b) Line 268 - "elusive tool use occupations are also commonly observed…" this sounds
contradictory, what do you mean?
c) Lines 294-297 - can you compare these patterns with those described for macaques (Tan et al.
2015, PLoS One)?
6) Discussion
a) Line 309 - there is a key difference between Cebus and Macaca tool use though, Cebus appear
to focus on plants, specifically T catappa, while macaques use tools predominantly to exploit
animal prey.
b) Figure 4 caption - there is a typo in the third line, "shoes"
c) Could you include some discussion as to why tool use was not observed in females (lines 301-
304 of your Findings)? This is an important point, and another apparent difference between
Cebus and Macaca, as well as with Pan. It seems that it would not be a physical limitation, since
smaller tools can also be used. Perhaps it relates to social structure and social learning. I wonder,
in your records of juvenile observations of tool use / attempts at tool use, were any of them

female?

This is a very relevant (and long-awaited for) report on tool use by capuchin monkeys in Coiba
National Park. Though behavioral traditions have long been reported among Cebus capucinus in
the social realm, this is the first observed case of spontaneous use of lithic tools in a gracile
capuchin monkeys, as opposed to their sister genus, Sapajus, the robust capuchins (among which
lithic tools' use is common in savanna populations).
Just a few comments:
l.30: "Sapajus flavius" (not "flaviius")(typo);
l.32: refs. 28-29 are single, anecdotal observations of probe use (29, in particular, is based in a
single camera trap frame, as far as I know, and is hard to be sure if it is actually about tool use).
Systematic reports of habitual probe tool use by Sapajus libidinosus (so far, observed in only one
population) can be found in Mannu & Ottoni 2009 and Falótico & Ottoni 2014.
ls. 85-92: "limited invention hypothesis" (X opportunity X necessity): AUTHOR?
I am also interested/curious about the authorship of this hypothesis. I see it is mentioned by
Fox/Sitompul/vanSchaik) in a 1999 book chapter ("The Mentalities of Gorillas and Orangutans:
Comparative Perspectives", edited by Parker, Mitchell & Miles), but not referenced... (by the way,
the present manuscript includes an interesting discussion on the "4 hypotheses"...)

Appendix A
To the editor and reviewers of this article—
We thank you for the time and thought you put into this manuscript as well as the
quick turnaround. Your comments made it better, clearer, and reminded me to
mention some glaring omissions that I thought I discussed (namely the proposed
reasons for sex bias in tool-use and a detailed discussion of sampling limitations).
We replied to each of the below comments (In italics) and made almost all of the
changes suggested—they are highlighted in yellow in a PDF version of final text.
Where we did follow your recommendations we specified why. Thank you for your
time and for agreeing to publish in an open peer review forum.
12-Jul-2018. We also made sure to edit the post script of our MS (ethics statement,
data accesibilty, acknowledgments, etc) as the editor requested.
We made a few grammatical and spelling corrections in text which we did not
highlight that were caught upon subsequent revisions—they do not change
scientific content. Also, we included a hyperlink to the supplemental video on
youtube in text where it was applicable. We also uploaded a lower quality version of
the supplemental video if you would like access to a permanent link. Supplemental

General comments
This manuscript provides the first report of habitual stone-tool use by Cebus
capucinus imitator on island habitats in Coiba National Park, a valuable discovery.
Cebus sp have not been known to be tool users despite widespread tool use in the
closely related Sapajus. The emergence of stone-tool-use behavior specifically on
island habitats rich in tool materials and encased food species, further parallels
patterns of habitual stone-tool use by island populations of Burmese long-tailed
macaques (Macaca fascicularis aurea), especially since M fascicularis are also not
known tool users. Based on the authors' observations via surveys and camera trap
recordings, tool use appears to be confined to one island, Jicarón in particular,
despite the availability of associated foods and tool materials on two other islands in
CNP that are also inhabited by capuchins (although this is not entirely convincing to
me, and I make several queries below). Tool use also appears to be a behavioral
specialization of male individuals. Further study of this behavior thus has significant
potential to contribute comparative data for understanding the biological,
ecological, and social drivers of the emergence of foraging specializations,
technological innovation, and cultural transmission in primates.
The authors have made an admirable effort to study a rare behavior in unhabituated
primates under challenging field conditions (I fully sympathize with the difficulties of
working with/against the tides!). Mostly, I think the manuscript would benefit from
clearer explanations of the rationales behind some of the methods, more detailed
reporting of the data obtained, and a stronger discussion of some of the findings
and implications of the research. I provide some suggestions below.
Comments on specific sections:
1) Introduction
a) I might suggest some restructuring of the introduction and discussion. The bulk
of the introduction is composed of a review of current explanations for the
emergence and maintenance of tool use traditions, and how these have been used
to account for differences in the prevalence of tool use by Cebus and Sapajus. It is
an excellent discussion, but when reading the manuscript, I felt that this
introduction somewhat overstates the focus of the report.
The behavior reported in this paper will certainly lend itself well to testing many of
these hypotheses, but the current report provides only preliminary descriptions of
the behavior based on nonsystematic camera trap records. The authors could
consider a more concise and representative introduction, saving these sections for
the discussion, and adding specific suggestions on how further studies might test
these outstanding hypotheses.
We decided not to restructure the bulk of the introduction and theoretical review
and move it to the discussion as one of the reasons we chose this journal was that it
provided sufficient length to discuss theory in detail compared to earlier drafts that
were pure description. In the abstract we added, “We review theory and discuss
factors…” to communicate to the reader that that is one of the aims of this paper in
addition to the behavioral description point of this report.
2) Study Site
a) Differences in plant diversity are reported - are there any data on potential
differences in the abundance of species associated with tool use (sea almonds,
coconuts)?
We are almost done mapping almendas on Jicaron and Rancheria. Coiba is too large
to do by foot. Coconuts are common on all of the islands, all (most) capuchins
appear to eat them, and the majority of the time capuchins eat them they just use
their teeth and or an anvil (no stone tools)—added in behavioral description.
In the discussion (line 314) we added:
Halloween crabs, hermit crabs, marine snails, coconuts, and Terminalia catappa
occur on all islands. Abundances of Terminalia catappa trees are currently being
estimated, but preliminary observation suggests that they are relatively rarer on
Ranchería. Groves of similar (or higher) densities occur on sections of Coiba and
Ranchería where we have not observed stone tool use. Future studies will address
the relative abundances within and between islands of the other 320 two primary
processed food items– Halloween crabs and hermit crabs. We did not observe tool
use at any of the artificial anvil sites we set up on the islands (Figure 1).
We also added an additional citation about plant richness at line 240:
Plant richness on Coiba is less than what is observed on similar forests on the
Panamanian mainland [94].
b) What about differences in the availability of marine invertebrates? This and
the above can inform on patterns of resource selection by capuchins vis-à-vis tool
use, i.e. are they utilizing foods in accordance with availability, or might tools be
used to exploit less abundant (but possibly higher quality) foods.
We adressed that marine invertebrates are present on all islands and that we hope
to address the relative availability of hermit crabs and Halloween crabs (which are
technically terrestrial/intertidal invertebrates I guess) in the question above. While
we have seen good evidence that marine snails are processed, we have observed this
far less than other behaviors. This is in part because cameras that would capture
marine snails (and clams) either get destroyed by cocaine traffickers or the tides.
Additionally, hermit crabs will often take marine snail shells and use them as homes,
making it challenging to estimate their usage relative to their availability. From
behavioral data, most of the shells we see processed appear to be hermit crabs.
We made it clearer that almendra, hermit crabs, and Halloween crabs are the
primary things we see processed with stone tools in the first paragraph of the
discussion (LINES 297-304). Marine snails and coconuts are less commonly processed
although coconuts are commonly eaten)
We also added at line 412: It is possible that there may exist undetected tool-using
populations in other areas of Coiba National Park. As previously noted, site
preservation might have an impact on the visibility of tool-use but it is unlikely to
obliterate all signs of such behavior. Additionally, the rugged topography and size of
the islands, limited accessibility of many locations by boat or foot, and prevalence
of cliffs and mangrove swamps on long stretches of coast prevent us from safely
conducting randomized surveys for tool-use– particularly on Coiba. Another
limitation in identifying tool use on other islands is that our camera trapping effort
was not proportional to island area or habitat type, as our primary aim in this initial
round of research was to focus on describing a behavior in areas and islands where
we knew tool-use was likely occurred given logistical and financial constraints. For
these reasons, we have have used targeted sampling and focused on looking for
evidence of tool-use in areas where we would predict it to exist: rocky intertidal
zones with access to forest interior, areas where Terminalia catappa is common,
underneath trees with hard, structurally protected fruits in the forest interior and
along rocky, seasonally dry stream beds. Further surveys of the forest interiors of
Jicarón and Coiba and along the coast of Coiba island are planned for future
expeditions and our uncertainty of absence on coastal areas will be quantified
relative to sampling effort. We hope to further increase camera trapping effort on
Coiba and Jicarón in the future. We can also not rule out that ecological differences
between Jicarón and populations on other islands and the mainland cannot explain
the patterns of tool use we observe. Addressing this is a promising future direction,
and to achieve this systematic, longitudinal data on resource availability and
abundance at each site would be needed.
c) Can the authors provide any data on the capuchin populations on these islands
(density, number of groups, number of individuals)?
This is dara that is currently being analyzed. There is an estimate for population
densities on Coiba, but we think there are many methodological flaws with this
study. We cite previous studies with group size estimates and add our own
observations. We added the following text at line 225:
Observations from a 12 day survey in 1974 estimated capuchin group sizes on Coiba
to be similar to mainland populations at Barro Colorado island [83]. Later estimates
[91] show similar group sizes with a mean of 10.75 individuals (range 5-16) and
suggest that capuchins on Coiba island occur at low densities. However, an increased
sam- pling effort, different surveying methodologies (such as randomization, camera
trapping and mark-recapture 230 analysis), and recent advances in analytical
approaches might yield a different estimate. Longitudinal studies in Costa Rica show
larger maximum annual group size with much variance (mean=23.20, sd=9.26,
range=5- 40, estimated from 20 years of data in Figure 7.1 in [92]). Our qualitative
impression on Jicarón show groups sizes up to an estimated 20 individuals and at
potentially high population densities. However, more system- atic data collection,
increased sampling effort, and nuanced analysis is needed to make reliable
comparisons of group size and population density, so current estimates should be
considered tentative.
d) Some description of anthropogenic impact on each island would be good. Are
there differences in anthropogenic impact/disturbance on each island? This can
affect tool use (e.g. van Schaik's "Fragility of Traditions"; Gumert &Malaivijitnond,
2012, Oryx)
We expanded on historical human impact in the description of the field site
(mentioned above in response to. Direct anthropogenic impact on these islands
appears low compared to mainland populations, and these populations have more
intact primary forest. However, large amounts of trash from the Pacific Ocean can
wash up on shore, as we have observed, in particular, on stretches of Jicaron. We
further alluded to this potential disturbance in the conservation implications section
(see text below). While the “fragility of traditions” perspective is compelling, direct
disturbance at our field site and human-primate interactions are rare.
Line 207 discusses:
Prior to the penal era which began in 1919, the archipelago (including the islands
which contain capuchin monkeys) was utilized and inhabited by indigenous people
who likely arrived from the Azuero Peninsula as early as 250 CE and by subsequent
groups from modern day Chiriquí and Coclé [84]. Europeans first 210 arrived in Coiba
in 1551; subsequent genocide, disease, and enslavement by Spanish colonists
eliminated indigenous populations on the island by the end of the 16th century [81].
During penal colony times, up to 1000 prisoners and their guards lived in 20 prison
camps, mostly along the east coast of Coiba, and including one in the northern coast
of Jicarón. Currently, only two islands in CNP have any constant human occupation
including a research station on Ranchería and a police station and national park
visitors center 215 on the northeast portion of Coiba. The other islands, including
Jicarón, have no recent long-term human settlement; human-wildlife interactions
are rare and mostly restricted to occasional interactions with local fishermen and
tourists along the coast.
In the discussion at line 443:
One noticeable observation, is that some coastal populations of capuchins in Coiba
National Park, including the one at the tool-use sites, can be exposed to tremendous
amounts of anthropogenic plastic waste which washes ashore from the Pacific ocean
(Supplemental Video). While primates occasionally appear to search for embedded
foods in this debris as if they would browse for embedded arthropods in the leaf
litter, how anthropogenic marine plastic that washes ashore impacts mammalian
health and behavior is a potentially
important avenue of inquiry to examine in Coiba National Park.
3) Coastal surveys
a) How many surveys were done?
We put more detail into the text at line 255:
B. Barrett and C. Monteza- Moreno surveyed the coasts of Jicarón, Coiba, and
Ranchería by boat to identify T. catappa groves. We then surveyed these islands,
including the entirety of the coasts of Jicarón and Ranchería at least twice, on foot to
look for evidence of tool use, including broken endocarps, hammerstones and anvils,
cracked crab and bivalve shells, and coconuts. We also surveyed approximately 8 km
of the coast of Coiba with a rocky intertidal zones and/or T. catappa groves.
b) Did surveys take into account when the monkeys last visited the area before
high/low tides? As the authors mention, tidal action can erase evidence of tool use.
No—we can only determine that if we see monkeys or their prints on the sand or
feces in the intertidal zone (or evidence of behavior). Out initial surveys mostly
targeted rocky parts of the intertidal and almendra groves. We recorded when we
observed monkeys at the site in each field note and will be sure to make this a part
of our survey protocol in the future.
c) Lines 225-226 - It seems like the authors focus disproportionately on sea
almonds in their island surveys and in their selection of camera trap sites, and I
wonder what the rationale is for this, since they might be missing much of tool use
on marine invertebrates.
Camera traps were placed at sea almond sites as they are more inland and in areas
where trees exist to mount camera traps. We also knew from that this was the
resource they used tools to open so we targeted these sights given logistical and
financial limitations. We wanted to observe more intertidal behavior but these
camera traps were destroyed which we mentioned in the text (see below) and made
clearer. This island is also a hotspot for cocaine trafficking from South America and
we do not want to place video cameras at places where traffickers are walking so
equipment is not destroyed and for our own safety.
Line 353: At first glance it appears that capuchins use stone tools more for plant
materials than marine invertebrates. However, the absence of direct observation in
an unhabituated population and challenges of placing camera traps in the intertidal
zone where mounting points are rare and destruction by tides and potentially
dangerous narcotics traffickers currently limit our ability to fully understand the
scope and frequency of tool use for marine invertebrates in the intertidal zone
without direct observation.
d) Lines 226-228 - were the number of used-tool sites and the types of foods
processed at each site recorded? If so, could the authors provide data on the
relative prevalence of food types processed with tools (perhaps in the findings
section)? This would also help to clarify my preceding comment, e.g. if marine
invertebrates comprised only a small proportion of foods processed, there might be
more reason to focus on T catappa to capture more observations (although tool use
on other foods should not be ignored in future more systematic studies).
This data was first systematically collected in March 2018, and will be examined
when there is enough to make meaningful conclusions. Otherwise our current
estimates are likely biased.
FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTION
4) Camera trapping effort
a) Camera trapping effort is not equal across islands relative to island size. Could
the authors provide a more detailed explanation of their rationale for this? In
Findings lines 276-277, it is reported that initial camera trapping failed to return
evidence of stone-tool use on Coiba and Rancharía, but there were only 5 total
camera traps deployed on these islands combined vs 30 on Jicarón. It could be that
tool use happens on these two islands but more rarely, and a lower sampling effort
further reduces the chances of observing it.
We agree with the reviewer. The focus of this initial study was to document a never
before seen behavior, and limited resources, time, and manpower prevented us from
doing this. Future camera trapping and coasta surveying on Coiba and Jicaron is a
priority for future research. Please see our reply to question 2b (text begins at line
412 of revised text).
b) How were sites selected - were they simply placed at all T catappa groves? If
so, that would mean that Jicarón has a much higher T catappa density, then it would
be important to discuss this as a possible ecological driver of tool use.
They were placed in T. catappa groves as that is where the behavior was first
observed. These groves are also further removed from sure, have better mounting
points for cameras, and are less conspicuous to drug traffickers.
Differences in T. catapa density are a possibility which we hope to examine in the
future. We mention this in the text at line 316. It might explain the absence on
Jicaron (where there may be only one or 2 capuchin groups and 8 almendra trees).
However our qualitative impression is that stretches of Coiba have more almendros
than Jicaron—and we have not observed tool use there.
Line 316:
Abundances of Terminalia catappa trees are currently being estimated, but
preliminary observation suggests that they are relatively rarer on Ranchería. Groves
of similar (or higher) densities occur on sections of Coiba and Ranchería where we
have not observed stone tool use. Future studies will address the relative
abundances within and between islands of the other 320 two primary processed
food items– Halloween crabs and hermit crabs.
c) Could tool use also take place where there are no T catappa but there are
marine invertebrates, i.e. is it possible that camera trapping effort was insufficient
to capture non- T catappa tool use?
Yes. We address this and the limitations of our study in our reply to question 2b:
WORDS
5) Findings
a) Lines 262-271 - Please report data on how many tool use sites were found,
how many instances/bouts (i.e. number of foods processed) of tool use were
recorded, and any other data you can provide about the proportion of tool use that
were in different habitat types / on different food types.
In writing this paper, we were aiming to do a simple description of the behavior and
ecological context to set the ground for future studies. We are currently building a
database to score thousands of hours of footage and develop a protocol to
accurately identify individuals to get an accurate number of bouts and rates of tool
use and how this might differ as a function of location along different. We have also
just begun to systematically collect data on distribution of tools across the landscape
(and the corresponding items which are processed with them). We currently do not
have enough systematically collected data to make any meaningful interpretations--.
For these reasons, we reported coarse daily measures across camera traps and
mentioned the limitations of this approach in text. Additionally, limitations of where
is safe and feasible to place camera traps which will detect tool using behavior affect
our ability to estimate tool-use for different food types and habitat types.
The number of sites we find so far appears to vary seasonally, and our sampling
effort on the site differed upon each trip once we got a good feeling for our system
(on or first trip we found 2 sites in 1 hour). In subsequent trips we found an
increasing number of sites (up to 50) as we surveyed more thoroughly. We would
prefer to report this in a future publication when that data has been systematically
collected over a longer time period and is of greater use and validity to readers.
b) Line 268 - "elusive tool use occupations are also commonly observed…" this
sounds contradictory, what do you mean?
Replaced “elusive” with “temporary”
c) Lines 294-297 - can you compare these patterns with those described for
macaques (Tan et al. 2015, PLoS One)?
We do not have images scored well enough to make a clear comparison (especially
since we can only observe tool use in forested areas), but qualitatively it appears
behavioral batters of percussive tool use to be less diverse than for macaques. We
added at line 351:
This is similar to long-tailed macaques in that multiple hammering techniques are
used to process different types of prey \citep{tan2015there}, however the
behavioral diversity appears to be less.
6) Discussion
a) Line 309 - there is a key difference between Cebus and Macaca tool use
though, Cebus appear to focus on plants, specifically T catappa, while macaques use
tools predominantly to exploit animal prey.
We are hesitant to make this claim until we have a clearer picture of intertidal
foraging behavior—. Since they are unhabituated and we cannot place camera traps
in the intertidal zone we don’ have a clear picture of tool use in the intertidal zone.
b) Figure 4 caption - there is a typo in the third line, "shoes"
replaced with shows
c) Could you include some discussion as to why tool use was not observed in
females (lines 301-304 of your Findings)? This is an important point, and another
apparent difference between Cebus and Macaca, as well as with Pan. It seems that
it would not be a physical limitation, since smaller tools can also be used. Perhaps it
relates to social structure and social learning. I wonder, in your records of juvenile
observations of tool use / attempts at tool use, were any of them female?
Whoops! I thought we talked about this in detail. Of the juveniles there were no
females we could confirm—we saw testes on all but two using juveniles who are too
young to accurately sex. They have male-like facial structures, but this is not a
reliable indicator. It is possible that females juveniles use tools who we have not yet
identified and we mention this possibility. We added at line 375:
Similar to robust capuchins [17; 28; 106; 107] , but unlike in chimpanzees [108; 109]
we observe a male sex-bias in tool use (in macaques the bias differs depending on
the type of tool use and food processed [110]). Despite this species having the
largest degree of sexual dimorphism of any robust or gracile capuchin species and
being the smallest observed wild primate species to habitually use stone tools (adult
males weigh 3-3.8 kg and adult females weigh 2-3 kg [33]), we do not think this sex
difference is due to differences in body size. Juveniles much smaller than adult
females habitually use tools. Even if future observations do show adult female
capuchins using tools, this difference is startling. Potential differences for this
behavior might be differing foraging behaviors amongst male and females– perhaps
females are allowed access to better quality resources in fruiting trees and do not
need to use stone tools to acquire adequate nutrition. Another possibility is that sex
differences in the visual systems make it easier for dichromatic males to detect
camouflaged almendra fruits on the forest floor compared to females who are better
at detecting contrasting colors [111]. There also may be sex differences in proclivity
for combinatorial actions as has been observed in Sapajus apella [112]. Perhaps
males are simply more likely to spend time on the ground than females as in other
species of new world monkeys [113], increasing the odds that they will use tools.
High population densities and resource limitation on this island might favor a
reversal in philopatry from female-biased to male-biased; on a resource limited
island with high population densities we might predict females to be the dispersing
sex [114]. Thus, adult females in this group who did use tools may have emigrated to
another area where we did not observe or detect them using tools and adult females
we observe in this group are natal to non-tool using groups. The presence of a
localized tradition solely in the (typically) non-philopatric sex is puzzling, and
something we are excited to address in the future.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a very relevant (and long-awaited for) report on tool use by capuchin
monkeys in Coiba National Park. Though behavioral traditions have long been
reported among Cebus capucinus in the social realm, this is the first observed case
of spontaneous use of lithic tools in a gracile capuchin monkeys, as opposed to their
sister genus, Sapajus, the robust capuchins (among which lithic tools' use is common
in savanna populations).
Just a few comments:
l.30: "Sapajus flavius" (not "flaviius")(typo);
Corrected
l.32: refs. 28-29 are single, anecdotal observations of probe use (29, in particular, is
based in a single camera trap frame, as far as I know, and is hard to be sure if it is
actually about tool use). Systematic reports of habitual probe tool use by Sapajus
libidinosus (so far, observed in only one population) can be found in Mannu &
Ottoni 2009 and Falótico & Ottoni 2014.
We added the above citations and reworded this section as this at line 32:
Other forms of tool use, especially the use of sticks to dig and probe, have also been
reported in a population of Sapajus libidinosus [27; 28] and more anecdotally or with
single observations in Sapajus apella [29], Sapajus flavius [30] and Sapajus
macrocephalus [31].
ls. 85-92: "limited invention hypothesis" (X opportunity X necessity): AUTHOR?
I am also interested/curious about the authorship of this hypothesis. I see it is
mentioned by Fox/Sitompul/vanSchaik) in a 1999 book chapter ("The Mentalities of
Gorillas and Orangutans: Comparative Perspectives", edited by Parker, Mitchell &
Miles), but not referenced... (by the way, the present manuscript includes an
interesting discussion on the "4 hypotheses"...)
Our attribution to Fox et al was not made clear (who came up with the commonly
used terms for 3 of these hypotheses). We added in text citations to the first mention
of the necessity, opportunity, and limited invention hypotheses. The fourth was the
limited invention. We added this at line 61 to make it clearer:
There are four commonly evaluated hypotheses to explain the presence and absence
of tool use in animal populations. Fox et al. [59] synthesized three hypotheses for
why primates use tools while another was articulated by Rutz et al [60].
l.144: "relative efficiency hypotheses" (x "relative PROFITABILITY hypotheses")? Or
something different (definition?)?
Corrected to “relative profitability”
l.183: "feedback LOOPS" ( typo)?

ls.191-217: How is current human presence on these islands, and what about
humans' interactions with the monkeys (present and past)?
We mentioned that Coiba was a penal colony—capuchins at some of the camps on
the coast of Coiba likely had neutral to negative interactions with the prisoners who
had to farm or gather their own food.
Line 207 discusses:
Prior to the penal era which began in 1919, the archipelago (including the islands
which contain capuchin monkeys) was utilized and inhabited by indigenous people
who likely arrived from the Azuero Peninsula as early as 250 CE and by subsequent
groups from modern day Chiriquí and Coclé [84]. Europeans first 210 arrived in Coiba
in 1551; subsequent genocide, disease, and enslavement by Spanish colonists
eliminated indigenous populations on the island by the end of the 16th century [81].
During penal colony times, up to 1000 prisoners and their guards lived in 20 prison
camps, mostly along the east coast of Coiba, and including one in the northern coast
of Jicarón. Currently, only two islands in CNP have any constant human occupation
including a research station on Ranchería and a police station and national park
visitors center 215 on the northeast portion of Coiba. The other islands, including
Jicarón, have no recent long-term human settlement; human-wildlife interactions
are rare and mostly restricted to occasional interactions with local fishermen and
tourists along the coast.
ls.45/371-3: taxonomy: see Boubli et al (2012):
"provisional reassessment for the taxonomy of untufted capuchins in the Amazon,
the Llanos, the Andes, Trinidad, and Central America, splitting currently paraphyletic
taxa into several species, including: at least two Amazonian species (C. yuracus and
C. unicolor); a species from the Guiana Shield (most likely the same as Humboldt's C.
albifrons); two northern Andean species, C. versicolor, C. cesarae; C. brunneus (with
trinitatis a junior synonym) on the Venezuelan coast, and C. adustus in the region of
Lake Maracaibo; C. capucinus in northwestern Ecuador and Colombia, and Panama;
C. imitator in Central America; C. olivaceus and C. castaneus occupying a large part
of the Guiana Shield; and C. kaapori in the eastern Amazon, south of the Rio
Amazonas."
[Am. J. Primatol. 74:381–393, 2012].
We added at line 47:
White-fronted capuchins, Cebus albifrons have been observed to use leaves as
sponges for drinking [43] while white-faced capuchins do the same with leaves, dried
wasp nests, and fruits [42]. However, while tools may be helpful for acquiring these
resources, they are not required. No examples of tool-use have been reported in
wedge-capped capuchins Cebus olivaceous or many of the recently reclassified [24;
44] and less well-studied species (i.e. Cebus yuracus, Cebus unicolor, Cebus kaapori,
Cebus versicolor, Cebus cesarae, Cebus leucocephalus and Cebus brunneus).
