In this manuscript, by means of density functional theory calculations, the authors investigated
the mechanisms selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene on of BNPd single-atom
catalysts. They presented adsorption energy, reaction pathways, and rationalized their results by
calculating the molecular orbital plots. The work is of novelty for publication. However, before its
publication, major revision of this manuscript were needed:
(1) The authors doped B12N12 cage as a B11N12Pd SAC was used as a catalyst for selective
hydrogenation of acetylene. What is the effect of B12N11Pd on the results? It looks that it was
not taken into account. Why?
(2) There is no mention about the possible molecular adsorption sites of both C2H2 and H2. If
there are differences in their molecular binding properties, different reaction pathways exist and
should be addressed.
(3) The authors should discuss the mechanism of hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane. It is
important for better understanding of the results. At this point it is not fully clear.
(4) There existed some grammar mistakes in the manuscript, for example, the sentence of “While

The manuscript "BNPd Single-atom Catalysts for Selective Hydrogenation of Acetylene to
Ethylene: A DFT Study" by Gong and Kangreports a DFT study of BNPd Single-atom Catalysts
3
for Selective Hydrogenation of Acetylene to Ethylene. The authors have considered various
mechanism for such reaction and conclude that the said catalyst has higher selectivity toward the
formation of ethylene than other metal alloys (listed in Table 3).
There are several points that need to be addressed before this manuscript can be accepted for
publications.
1) The abstract refers to a barrier of 26.55 kcal/mol and it is referred again in the end of the text.
However, details for this calculation are not in the manuscript.
2) The reference to Table 1 on the bottom of page 9 does not support the authors argument. Is
this information in another table? The authors need to double check all presented data and cross-
references in the manuscript.
3) The conclusion about the high selectivity of the said catalyst is based on the definition in Eq. 5.
This is counter-intuitive. The more positive a delta Ea is, the the higher Ea is. It means that the
reaction has a larger barrier. Transition state theory would suggest that this reaction should have
a slow rate with high selectivity is not guaranteed.
4) In addition, the authors’s aim is to compare the selectivity toward ethylene or ethane but there
is no information about ethane formation included in this equation. Thus, a good explanation is
needed. (In general, selectivity is not control by thermodynamics, but kinetics. A Kinetic Monte
Carlo simulation is needed to make general conclusion about selectivity)

Title: BNPd Single-atom Catalysts for Selective Hydrogenation of Acetylene to Ethylene: A DFT
Study
Author(s): Wanqi Gong, Lihua Kang*
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our
manuscript entitled “BNPd Single-atom Catalysts for Selective Hydrogenation of Acetylene to
Ethylene: A DFT Study” (ID: RSOS-171598). Those comments are all valuable and very
helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding
significance to our researches. We have studied comments carefully and have made
correction which we hope meet with approval. Revised portion are marked in red in
the paper. The main corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s
comments are as following:
Reviewer:1
Question 1: The authors doped B12N12
cage as B11N12Pd SAC was used as a catalyst for selective hydrogenation of
acetylene. What is the effect of B12N11Pd on the results? It looks that it was not
taken into account. Why?
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We are sorry for neglecting explain why
B12N11Pd is not account as the catalyst for selective hydrogenation of acetylene,
therefore, we have added a detailed explanation in the following words.
Firstly, we attempted to study the catalytic effect of B12N11Pd on the
hydrogenation of acetylene using the DFT, but we did not find the complete reaction
path for the reaction. However, we can use the data to explain why it does not have
the catalytic effect.
Figure 1 shows the calculated reaction diagram for the H2 adsorption on
B12N11Pd SAC. The corresponding activation barrier (energy difference between TS
and IS) for the dissociative reaction is found to be 17.49 kcal mol-1,and the energy of
the final state is 5.38 kcal mol-1, it indicating that H2 is difficult to dissociative
chemisorption on the B12N11Pd SAC and the B12N11Pd(2H) dihydride complex is not
stable. And our conclusion shows that the hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene
followed the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. Therefore, B12N11Pd SAC is not
used as a catalyst for seletctive hydrogenation of acetylene.
Fig. 1 Calculated hydrogenation reaction diagram for the B12N11Pd SAC. The schematic
diagrams of initial (IS), transition (TS), and final (FS) states are illustrated by side views.
Question 2: There is no mention about the possible molecular adsorption sites of
both C2H2 and H2. If there are differences in their molecular binding properties,
different reaction pathways exist and should be addressed.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. It is very important to study the adsorption
sites of adsorbates for the reaction, we use the FMO analysis to determine the reaction
sites. In this work, as the Figure 1 shown, Pd atom may be the only active site of the
B11N12Pd SAC. In order to fully consider the possible adsorption sites, we put C2H2
and H2 on different sites both around the Pd atom and the BN nanocage. The results
showed that only the Pd atom is the active site of reaction and obtained the most
stable structure, as the Figure 2 shown.
Question 3: The authors should discuss the mechanism of hydrogenation of
ethylene to ethane. It is important for better understanding of the results. At this
point it is not fully clear.
Response: We are very sorry for lack of a clear reaction mechanism
explanation of hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane. In the manuscript, we
investigated the mechanism of hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane. In P.12, 3.3.4,
we studied the C2H4 adsorbed onto the B11N12Pd(2H) dihydride complex, and then
reacted to generate ethane in detail, as the Figure 5 shown. And in 3.3.5, we
investigated the non-Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism of hydrogenation of ethylene to
ethane action onto the B11N12Pd, and we have added the explanation in the
Supplementary material, as F.S4 shown.
Question 4: There existed some grammar mistakes in the manuscript, for
example, the sentence of “While one of the B-
N bonds shared between two six-membered rings with length about 1.44 Å”
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We apologize for the grammatical
mistakes that appear in the manuscript, and carefully examined and revised them.
Question 5: The Supplementary Material should include the optimized
geometries of the reported structures.
Response: We are sorry for missing the optimized geometries of the reported
structures, and we added its in the Supplementary Material, in P6-P32.
Reviewer:2
Question 1: The abstract refers to a barrier of 26.55 kcal/mol and it is referred
again in the end of the text. However, details for this calculation are not in the
manuscript.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We are sorry for did not explain the
activation energy clearly. In this work, the barrier of the reaction is the energy gap
between IMS1 and TS2, from the energy diagrams of the R1,as the Figure 4 shown.
Question 2: The reference to Table 1 on the bottom of page 9 does not support
the authors argument. Is this information in another table? The authors need to
double check all presented data and cross-references in the manuscript.
Response: We are very sorry for making a slip in writing, and we have already
corrected this mistake.
Question 3: The conclusion about the high selectivity of the said catalyst is based
on the definition in Eq. 5. This is counter-intuitive. The more positive a delta Ea
is, the the higher Ea is. It means that the reaction has a larger barrier. Transition
state theory would suggest that this reaction should have a slow rate with high
selectivity is not guaranteed.
Response: Thank you for your interest in our work, the selective formula (Eq. 5) we
used in this article is a reference to the work of. The selectivity of ethylene can be
estimated by comparing the difference between the hydrogenation barrier and the
desorption barrier of ethylene. It was found that desorption barriers were, in general,
lower than the absolute value of the adsorption energies of the adsorbents. {Cao, X.-
M.; Burch, R.; Hardacre, C.; Hu, P. Catal. Today 2011, 165, 71}. The previous work
certified that an ideal catalyst should have a high hydrogenation barrier for ethylene
and a low adsorption energy.{Yang, B.; Wang, D.; Gong, X.-Q.; Hu, P. Phys. Chem.
Chem.Phys. 2011, 13, 21146} The desorbed barriers are estimated with the absolute
value of the adsorption energies according to the approximation made in previous
studies. I believe the original will give you a complete explanation. (ref.8,16)
Question 4: In addition, the authors’s aim is to compare the selectivity toward
ethylene or ethane but there is no information about ethane formation included
in this equation. Thus, a good explanation is needed. (In general, selectivity is not
control by thermodynamics, but kinetics. A Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation is
needed to make general conclusion about selectivity)
Response: Thanks for your valuable comments, we will conduct a separate kinetic
study in the follow-up work.
Question 5: All of the manuscript figures are missing captions
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We've added the captions of all the
pictures and tables that appear in the manuscript.
In all, I found the reviewer’s comments are quite helpful and I revised my paper
point-by-point. Thank you and the review again for your help.
