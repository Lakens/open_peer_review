I only have two comments on this manuscript, both relatively minor, which I feel could be
elaborated upon to improve its global relevance.
Firstly, in the Introduction and Discussion, it could be clarified that the Prochilodus pattern of
reproduction (main channel spawner, floodplain growth with upstream migration and
downstream larval drift) is only one of a number of migratory/reproductive guilds that have
adapted to the demands of flood river environments. The main channel spawning habit, with
downstream drifting larvae, is a common strategy in Latin American and Asian rivers. As such
the success of breeding in any year is dependent on the nature of the flood (strength, timing etc,)
as well as on the flooding of the floodplain. The responses of species that spawn and grow on the
floodplain are likely to have a much closer tie between floodplain inundation and population
strength.
Secondly, I find the conclusions somewhat difficult to abstract from the discussion and abstract. It
is, for example, usual that where a nul hypothesis is advance that the text clarify whether the
hypothesis is accepted or rejected.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
Despite the fact that Junk et al’s Flood Pulse and Bayley’s Flood Pulse Advantage Concepts were
posited decades ago, robust empirical studies that test the hypotheses and assumptions of these
3
compelling concepts are far too few. It follows that this study by Bayley et al is an important one.
Bayley et al. use historical commercial fisheries catch data for Prochilodus nigricans to examine
the effect of floodplain inundation on cohort strength. They show that strength of the 0+ cohort—
but not the 1+ cohort—was positively related to the area of floodplain inundate earlier that year,
likely during a critical post-larval period. As such, this paper adds critical information to a small
but growing literature documenting the significance of flood pulses to riverine fish population
dynamics. However, I have some concerns that I think need to be addressed before the paper
could be deemed acceptable for publication.
First, I’m not particularly convinced about the robustness of the statistical analysis of the
hydrological effects on cohort strength. The authors note: “the number of independent tests is
limited because there are strong correlations of population size among age classes of
corresponding cohorts” (ll. 320-321). This is an unavoidable, standard problem in cohort analysis.
In this paper the authors test for independence in cohort size across years, then only include
subsets of the data that meet some criterion of independence. This may be the reason the authors
only can conclude an effect on 0+ cohort strength, rather than more interesting, dynamics effects
that permeate the dynamics of the population. Filtering the data for uncorrelated cohort
abundances across years seems counterintuitive to me as such data are unavoidably correlated. I
think the readers would be more convinced—and indeed the results may end up a lot more
interesting/compelling/important—if the authors employed analyses examining the effects of
hydrology on survival rates rather than numbers, per se. Towards that end the authors could
explore cohort anlaysis (e.g. Haddon 2011, Ch. 12), or allow for correlation in abundances across
years induced by cohort strengths using modern multilevel regression techniques (Pinheiro and
Bates 2000).
Second, the paper is hard to read—really hard to read. The Introduction is fine, but then when the
reader encounters methods it becomes very difficult to decipher what the authors have done,
how they’ve calculated metrics, etc. The section describing use of the MULTIFAN-CL is fine, but
the explanation needs to be clarified immensely. I’ve provided a couple of examples in my
specific comments below. Part of the rewrite of the manuscript must include shifting a lot of
material/most of the figures to Supporting Information.
Third, the paper is almost exclusively Amazon-centric. This is reflected in the text but also in the
literature cited. I’m certain the paper could have a much broader appeal if the authors made more
of an effort to discuss their work within the international context of large river-floodplain
ecology—numerous interesting papers addressing, for example, the Flood-Pulse Advantage have
been published in recent years, but they aren’t cited. I won’t present examples because I don’t
want to bias the authors’ search, but there is a rapidly growing literature that’s been ignored here
(I just typed the search string ‘flood pulse advantage’ into Web of Science and found at least 20
papers that are relevant published over the last five years.
Specific comments and suggestions:
Ll 120-121: Delete sentence “This section describes…”. The section title makes it clear. This is an
example of where words can be cut from the manuscript more broadly.
Fig. 3: I think Fig. 3 is an example of information that supports decisions in the analysis approach.
As such I think it is one of the figures that can be moved to Supporting Information. I also think
Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 are unnecessary within the main document, given the broad readership of the
journal.
Ll 128-130: Delete sentence: “Littoral areas along steeper shorelines…” Anyone with a basic
intuition for everyday geometry will know this so delete. Another example of unnecessary
words. Also this is another example of where the details the reader wishes to find is lost in too
4
much detail around natural history of the Amazon. Impact of the article could be improved by
just getting to the point.
L 134: Just the sum. Keep it simple to make the paper easier for busy people to digest.
Ll 133-146: I like the concept of the moving littoral, however I find the explanation here very
confusing. Given satellite data is used, surely what we need to know is the total area of the
littoral up to 1 m deep? If that is true then state it as simply as that (or something similar)—don’t
try and make it sound more complicated than it is. It isn’t clear whether the littoral area is defined
by the water surface or the surface of the inundated benthos. Please clarify. If it is the surface of
the benthos then state that Pythagoras’ Theorem was used given the assumption that the edge of
the littoral was always defined by the 1 m isocline, and the other side of the triangle was defined
by the distance between the 1m isocline and the edge of the water. The readers also need further
information about how the authors knew where the 1m isocline was.
A suggestion: Given the advancing and retreating littoral should have very different effects on
fish production, I think the definition of the ML could be greatly improved by making it a rate of
change in inundation of new habitat, such that we have positive value for advancement, and
negative values for recession. This would be a more operational definition that the one presented.
l. 150. No need to refer to a map every single time you mention the Amazon. Shift the map to the
Supporting Information altogether and refer the reader there just once, for those readers that like
to explore details of where the study took place.
Ll 156-168: This paragraph makes sense up until l. 159: “Fishing effort for remaining 17%...”.
After here it descends into unhelpful, esoteric jargon with no logical flow. For 83% of samples
fishing effort is defined intuitively as the product of (a) number of fishermen and (b) number of
days fished per fisherman (I added ‘per fisherman’ here – something you need to clarify). For the
remaining 17% of samples I’m assuming the idea is to approximate fishing effort, given the data
for direct estimation don’t exist. Instead, the reader is hit with these first two sentences (and it
gets worse thereafter): “Fishing effort for remaining 17% of trips was estimated, using log(effort)
to normalise data, based on functions including significant effects of gear used, region fished, and
days fished or number of fishermen when one was recorded. Prediction error was based on cross-
validation.” Straight away you’ve lost the reader. State first the overarching objective
underpinning these lines. Then make it clear why factors such as ‘gear used’ and ‘region fished’
enter the approximation, given they haven’t been factored into effort estimation for the remaining
83% of samples. State why prediction error was estimated before telling the reader how it was
calculated. Etc Etc. It shouldn’t be up to referees to point out such laziness in writing.
l. 173: Replace ‘it’s’ with ‘its’.
Hydrological effects on abundance: Correlation of cohort sizes across years is unavoidable in
cohort analysis. However, I wonder whether the authors could do a better job of modelling the
data using modern multilevel or hierarchical models that allow for hierarchical correlation
structures (Pinheiro and Bates 2000)? The approach taken is confusing and seems very
fragmented.

I only have two comments on this manuscript, both relatively minor, which I feel could be
elaborated upon to improve its global relevance.
Firstly, in the Introduction and Discussion, it could be clarified that the Prochilodus pattern of
reproduction (main channel spawner, floodplain growth with upstream migration and downstream
larval drift) is only one of a number of migratory/reproductive guilds that have adapted to the
demands of flood river environments. The main channel spawning habit, with downstream drifting
larvae, is a common strategy in Latin American and Asian rivers. As such the success of breeding in
any year is dependent on the nature of the flood (strength, timing etc,) as well as on the flooding of
the floodplain. The responses of species that spawn and grow on the floodplain are likely to have a
much closer tie between floodplain inundation and population strength.
Reponse: We have clarified this issue in the Introduction and Discussion
Secondly, I find the conclusions somewhat difficult to abstract from the discussion and abstract. It is,
for example, usual that where a nul hypothesis is advance that the text clarify whether the
hypothesis is accepted or rejected.
Response: These are good points. Discussion and Conclusions have been combined.

comments below. Part of the rewrite of the manuscript must include shifting a lot of material/most
of the figures to Supporting Information.
Hydrological effects on abundance:”
Response: This is a valid point. We have rewritten sections of the MS (see below) and, with the
agreement of the editor, proposed the transfer of some sections to Supporting Information. These
changes, we believe, shall greatly improve the clarity of the text.
“Third, the paper is almost exclusively Amazon-centric. This is reflected in the text but also in the
literature cited. I’m certain the paper could have a much broader appeal if the authors made more
of an effort to discuss their work within the international context of large river-floodplain ecology—
numerous interesting papers addressing, for example, the Flood-Pulse Advantage have been
published in recent years, but they aren’t cited. I won’t present examples because I don’t want to
bias the authors’ search, but there is a rapidly growing literature that’s been ignored here (I just
typed the search string ‘flood pulse advantage’ into Web of Science and found at least 20 papers
that are relevant published over the last five years.”
Response: This is a valid point. We have broadened the Summary, Introduction, and Discussion and
Conclusion sections. All these sections have been revised to adequately consider more of the global
and new literature on the topic, and to place the contribution of the present study in a broader
“knowledge gap” context. The relevance of this study to a global audience should now be self-
evident.
Specific comments and suggestions:
Ll 120-121: Delete sentence “This section describes…”. The section title makes it clear. This is an
example of where words can be cut from the manuscript more broadly.
Response: Done.
Fig. 3: I think Fig. 3 is an example of information that supports decisions in the analysis approach. As
such I think it is one of the figures that can be moved to Supporting Information. I also think Fig. 1
and Fig. 2 are unnecessary within the main document, given the broad readership of the journal.
Response: Fig. 3 provides essential data used in the quantification of the Moving Littoral, and
therefore we believe should be retained in the main document. We make 4 references to Fig. 2, of
which 3 are in the Life History section. The 4th in the Analysis of fishery data section was removed.
We prefer to retain all Figs. with the main text, but if the editor wishes to move Fig. 1 (see
comments under l. 150 below) and Fig. 2 to Supporting Information, we accede.
Ll 128-130: Delete sentence: “Littoral areas along steeper shorelines…” Anyone with a basic intuition
for everyday geometry will know this so delete. Another example of unnecessary words. Also this is
another example of where the details the reader wishes to find is lost in too much detail around
natural history of the Amazon. Impact of the article could be improved by just getting to the point.
Response: We have removed the sentence.
L 134: Just the sum. Keep it simple to make the paper easier for busy people to digest.
Response: Done
Ll 133-146: I like the concept of the moving littoral, however I find the explanation here very
confusing. Given satellite data is used, surely what we need to know is the total area of the littoral
up to 1 m deep? If that is true then state it as simply as that (or something similar)—don’t try and
make it sound more complicated than it is. It isn’t clear whether the littoral area is defined by the
water surface or the surface of the inundated benthos. Please clarify. If it is the surface of the
benthos then state that Pythagoras’ Theorem was used given the assumption that the edge of the
littoral was always defined by the 1 m isocline, and the other side of the triangle was defined by the
distance between the 1m isocline and the edge of the water. The readers also need further
information about how the authors knew where the 1m isocline was.
Response: We are surprised by this comment. Fig. 6 indicates the geometry. We subtract from the
total flooded area at the current stage, the total flooded area predicted when the stage is 1-m lower
corresponding to the 1-m water depth. By 'total' we mean total. Each area estimate from the
satellite includes everything that has surface water. Because we can predict these areas as a
function of stage (Fig. 7), then we can estimate their differences as littoral area. Fig. 6 also shows
that we are dealing with a surface area (under 'littoral area') and not the benthic area. Each littoral
area is a static estimate, but varies according to stage (Fig. 8). The Moving Littoral is quantified as the
sum of daily littoral areas over the hydrological period of interest (Fig. 9). The math confirms the
geometry and the verbal statement.
To clarify the derivation of ML, we have rewritten parts of this section. We have also removed the
bankfull condition, and redefined ML for advancing period to start from the minimum water level.
The test results were very similar (the Figs. and computations have been adjusted accordingly). The
bankfull definition is still referred to in Hydrological effects on Abundance because it was required to
compute FI.
A suggestion: Given the advancing and retreating littoral should have very different effects on fish
production, I think the definition of the ML could be greatly improved by making it a rate of change
in inundation of new habitat, such that we have positive value for advancement, and negative values
for recession. This would be a more operational definition that the one presented.
Response: This is a useful suggestion for a second property of the moving littoral. However it is
definitely not presented as a potential replacement for ML because it does not describe the
magnitude of available habitat. We have defined and computed this (end of Moving Littoral section),
and included it in the analysis (Hydrological effects on Abundance).
l. 150. No need to refer to a map every single time you mention the Amazon. Shift the map to the
Supporting Information altogether and refer the reader there just once, for those readers that like to
explore details of where the study took place.
Response: Each of the 4 references to Fig. 1 has a separate reason for referral. We prefer these to
remain, as well as the Figure. However, we will leave it to the editor if he/she wants us to remove
these references and move it to Supporting Information.
Ll 156-168: This paragraph makes sense up until l. 159: “Fishing effort for remaining 17%...”. After
here it descends into unhelpful, esoteric jargon with no logical flow. For 83% of samples fishing
effort is defined intuitively as the product of (a) number of fishermen and (b) number of days fished
per fisherman (I added ‘per fisherman’ here – something you need to clarify). For the remaining 17%
of samples I’m assuming the idea is to approximate fishing effort, given the data for direct
estimation don’t exist. Instead, the reader is hit with these first two sentences (and it gets worse
thereafter): “Fishing effort for remaining 17% of trips was estimated, using log(effort) to normalise
data, based on functions including significant effects of gear used, region fished, and days fished or
number of fishermen when one was recorded. Prediction error was based on cross-validation.”
Straight away you’ve lost the reader. State first the overarching objective underpinning these lines.
Then make it clear why factors such as ‘gear used’ and ‘region fished’ enter the approximation, given
they haven’t been factored into effort estimation for the remaining 83% of samples. State why
prediction error was estimated before telling the reader how it was calculated. Etc Etc. It shouldn’t
be up to referees to point out such laziness in writing.
Response: Thank you for the appropriate criticism. This section has been rewritten. Also, following
suggestions elsewhere, we have moved the section to Supporting Material.
l. 173: Replace ‘it’s’ with ‘its’.
Response: Done
“Hydrological effects on abundance: Correlation of cohort sizes across years is unavoidable in cohort
analysis. However, I wonder whether the authors could do a better job of modelling the data using
modern multilevel or hierarchical models that allow for hierarchical correlation structures (Pinheiro
and Bates 2000)? The approach taken is confusing and seems very fragmented.”
Response (to this and earlier issue re survival rate):
Let us first clarify the following. We address effects on the fish population of hydrologically-
controlled habitat availability, using the fishery as a sampling instrument. We do not address effects
on the fishery. In fact, we must minimize or account for fishery effects on population size. Age2 is
the youngest age group that have recruited substantially to the fishery (Fig 10) and is therefore well
sampled. Age1 recruitment was very weak and moreover subject to discarding rather than effort
(see MS). Older age groups are obviously dependent on subsequent survival (Nt+1=Ntexp(-(F+M)). M
is assumed constant (see Discussion), and F is controlled by fishing effort and efficiency and
dominates M for older age groups (see MS). Therefore, estimates for older fish are influenced by the
fishery in a compounding fashion, and correspondingly effects of hydrologically controlled habitat
change become less detectable. This would be an issue even if the strong correlations reported
among potential test did not exist or were accounted for.
The foregoing is germane to the suggestion to use survival rate as a response. Moreover, most
fishing effort and yield occurs during the drawdown period and not during the advancing littoral. As
such, regarding the comment/criticism made, we ask the following: How does one relate survival to
a measure of habitat, if we cannot measure that survival during the hydrological period of interest?
Therefore, the reviewer’s criticism/comment does not apply.
The reviewer states "the authors only can conclude an effect on 0+ cohort strength, rather than
more interesting, dynamics effects that permeate the dynamics of the population." We made cogent
arguments that the Age2(2+) population was the least affected by the fishery, and among three
independent tests the available habitat earlier in the same year predicted population size with high
significance. Given the data, we cannot see any justification for pursuing "dynamics effects ...." even
if we could define such concepts in an ecological context. We stand by our parsimonious approach.
