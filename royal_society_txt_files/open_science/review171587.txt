1. Check the requirements for the journal, but generally variables are italicised.
2. Pp. 2, Eq. 3.1, x double dot needs defined. In this equation, it is difficult to ascertain that f_total = mx double

accordingly.

The authors presented a novel method for soft tissue simulation based on a position-based method. New
constraints was introduced into the formulation to realize nonlinearity, viscoelasticity and incompressibility.
Simulation results were provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. I think the paper can be
accepted for publication. But I have some suggestions for the authors:
1. The author mentioned it is difficult to simulate the nonlinearity of soft tissue for position-based method,
actually it has been discussed in [1].
2. As an attempt for virtual reality, it is necessary to discuss the reaction force in the system
3. The author claimed the system is real-time, it is better to include the time cost in the paper.

Appendix A
Dear Editor,
We have studied the valuable comments from you, the associate editor, subject editor , and reviewers
carefully, and tried our best to revise the manuscript. The point to point responds to the reviewer’s comments
are listed as following:
Responds to the subject editor’s comment:
Comment: Seems the paper contains a useful and novel contribution (but note typo in the title).
Response: According to the comment, we have checked not only the title but also the whole manuscript to
keep the words correct. In the title, “dynamcis” is modified as “dynamics”.
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer 1
Comment 1: One of the things that I was surprised that was not mentioned is the material point method. I
think that a short mention of this needs to be included in this paper.
Response: Material point method is a typical meshless method, which the simulation body is constructed by
“material point” to keep the material property, the background grid is used to calculate the deformation
gradient. Considering reviewer’s advice and the wide use of it in large deformation and multiphase
simulation. In the introduction part, the comparison of mesh based method and meshless method is added as
follows:
Due to deformation introducing the mesh distortion which reduced accuracy, finite element
method is naturally difficult to deal with large deformation. But the meshless method does not require
connection info between simulation node, it works well under large deformation. Also, the material
point method uses particles called material point to keep the physical properties and calculate the
deformation gradient under background grid, it has been widely used in large deformation,
multiphase simulation and fluid dynamics [8].
Comment 2: Check the requirements for the journal, but generally variables are italicized.
Response: Thanks to the reminding of reviewer, we have checked the format of variables involved in the
manuscript to make it more professional. We abide by the rules of using bold for matrices and vectors, and
using italics for basic variables.
Comment 3: Pp. 2, Eq. 3.1, <U+0001D431>¨ needs defined, In this equation, it is difficult to ascertain that <U+0001D41F><U+0001D461><U+0001D45C><U+0001D461><U+0001D44E><U+0001D459> = <U+0001D40C><U+0001D431>¨ .
Please elaborate.
Response: From Newton’s second law of motion:
<U+0001D451><U+0001D463>
F=<U+0001D45A> = <U+0001D45A><U+0001D44E>
<U+0001D451><U+0001D461>
The accelerate of single mass point can be measured by the total force load on it. We combine the whole
mass point position as one column vector <U+0001D431> = [<U+0001D465>1 <U+0001D465>2 <U+22EF> <U+0001D465><U+0001D45B> ]<U+0001D447> and define total force on mass points as
<U+0001D41F><U+0001D461><U+0001D45C><U+0001D461><U+0001D44E><U+0001D459> . The accelerates of mass points are represented as the second order derivative to time.
According to the reviewer’s advice, we put more detailed description alongside the definition of mass point
positions as follows:
the <U+0001D431>¨ is the second order derivative of mass point position to time which are common described as
the acceleration of mass points.
Comment 4: Pp. 2, line 39, you should not be defining x unless it is being used here. This really should be
defined with Eq. 3.2 being targeted.
Response: Thanks for reviewers’ carefulness, From the response to comment 3, for descripting the <U+0001D431>¨ , we
need to define the <U+0001D431> first and calculate the derivative. Maybe, it’s appropriate to put its definition before Eq.
3.2.
Comment 5: Pp.2, Eq. 3.3, there is a constant of 1/2 missing; please check and correct. Change any
dependent equations accordingly.
Response: According to reviewer’s reminding, we re-checked Eq. 3.3 and the formula might be correct.
Here’s more detailed derivation.
From Eq. 3.2:

<U+0001D414>(x) = <U+0001D402>(<U+0001D431>)<U+0001D447> <U+0001D6C2>-1 <U+0001D402>(<U+0001D431>),

The derivation used following propositions:
1. For the special case where <U+0001D400> is a symmetric matrix and <U+0001D6C2> = <U+0001D417> <U+0001D413> <U+0001D400><U+0001D417>, where <U+0001D417> is n × 1, <U+0001D400> is n × n, and
<U+0001D400> does not depend on <U+0001D417>, then
<U+2202><U+0001D6C2>
= 2<U+0001D417> <U+0001D447> <U+0001D400>
<U+2202><U+0001D431>
2. (<U+0001D400><U+0001D401><U+0001D402>)<U+0001D447> = <U+0001D402> <U+0001D447> <U+0001D401> <U+0001D447> <U+0001D400><U+0001D447>
Considering this is not the core part of the method, we try not to add the detailed derivation in the main
manuscript for keeping its concision.
Comment 6: Pp.2, Eq. 3.6, please verify the definition of <U+0001D41F><U+0001D45C><U+0001D462><U+0001D461> .
Response: According to reviewer’s advice, we check the definition and find that it’s a redefinition of external
forces loaded on the mass points, which is the same as <U+0001D41F><U+0001D452><U+0001D465><U+0001D461><U+0001D452><U+0001D45F><U+0001D45B><U+0001D44E><U+0001D459> . We have modified all of <U+0001D41F><U+0001D45C><U+0001D462><U+0001D461> to <U+0001D41F><U+0001D452><U+0001D465><U+0001D461><U+0001D452><U+0001D45F><U+0001D45B><U+0001D44E><U+0001D459> ,
this makes the derivation more clearness.
Comment 7: Pp.3 line 7, when using the Newton-Raphson method, I assume that the linearization is for the
described steps and not over the entire force/displacement. Please elaborate.
Response: As the reviewer put it, From the Eq. 3.7 and Eq. 3.8 , the constraint functions <U+0001D402>(<U+0001D431>) are often not
the linear equation of mass point position. Such as the tetrahedral volume constraint described in Model
Example part as below:
1
<U+0001D436>(<U+0001D45D>1 , <U+0001D45D>2 , <U+0001D45D>3 , <U+0001D45D>4 ) = (<U+0001D45D> × <U+0001D45D>3,1 ) · <U+0001D45D>4,1 - <U+0001D449>0
6 2,1
We can not get the analytical solution of mass position directly, in these general cases, we using the Newton-
Raphson method to solve the nonlinear equations iteratively by using partial derivatives to approximate the
actual solution of mass point positions. This process occurs only within a single times step.
To explain this more clearly, we add a description of this, as below:
Due to the constraint function is abstracted on the physical deformation behaviour, it is often not the
linear form of mass point position. There is no analytical solution for mass point position directly.
Comment 8: Pp.3, line 16, you should place equations not in line with text but as a separate equation.
Response: Based on reviewer’s comments, we re-edited the formula and amended the subsequent formula
numbers.
Comment 9: Pp.4, line 37, these are not physical models, you are referring to PBD geometric models?
Change accordingly.
Response: Yes, not only the PBD model, but also the mass spring dampers. These basic elements are
combined for latter deformation calculating. According to the reviewer’s advice, we changed this line to:
Finally, the basic elements for deformation calculating are generated from topology information such
as nodes, springs, and constraints.
Comment 10: Fig.10, what is the reason for the oscillatory response? You should explain.
Response: The reason is that the viscoelasticity is modeled and represented by mass spring damper. For
testing the stress-relaxation, the total force loaded on the fixed mass point should be recorded under constant
displacement. During the test environment, a fixed displacement is applied on the mass point for a short time
which causes the elastic force is greater than damping force. The velocity of mass points connected to the
fixed one can not be constrained right now and would cause the oscillatory response. Our simulation is
running on the fixed timestep, it can be avoided through variable time step which using smaller timestep
during move the mass point to target position. Momentary displacement or force almost does not happen in
practical applications. And oscillation response has little change to the trend of stress-relaxation, So, we did
not discuss and optimize it in the main part.
According to reviewer’s advice, we add the description of it in the Results part as below:
In the beginning of the test, due to the momentary displacement applied on test point, the instant
elastic force loaded on the connected mass points around test point are much larger than the damping
force, it causes the slight oscillatory response of the total loading force. But it quickly stabilized under
the constraint of damping force by viscoelasticity. With the increase of the viscoelasticity coefficient
<U+0001D483><U+0001D7CF> , the trend of force declining becomes slower and the oscillatory response becomes weaker. The
oscillatory response also can be optimized by variable timestep simulation. On the general trend, the
model maintains the tendency of forcing decline over time, and the decay rate becomes slower as the
viscoelasticity coefficient <U+0001D483><U+0001D7CF> increase.
And we add the future optimizing method in the Conclusion part.
Under extreme deformations, such as momentary displacement or force, the system has slight
oscillations, which can be improved by introducing variable timestep simulation. Meanwhile, the
variable timestep can be used for reducing time cost.
Comment 11: Pp.5, line 16, you need to elaborate on the Mooney-Rivlin model. How many parameters?
Even though you can tell from the figure, it should be identified in the text.
Response: Thanks to the advice of the reviewer, the two papers mentioned before this line are the reference
to the selection of our models and parameters. In order to point out more significantly about what is the
Mooney-Rivlin model and why the selection of the Mooney-Rivlin model and the parameters of the model
is. We have added the following parts to it.
The Mooney-Rivlin model is the finite element model using polynomial forms of the strain energy.
By extending the basic Neo-Hookean model with the addition of the second invariant of the right
Cauchy-Green strain tensors. It can be used to model the material that exhibit some limited
compressibility. The Mooney-Rivlin model with 2-Constant parameters models rubber well. The 5-
Constant parameters of the Mooney-Rivlin model can be used to model liver. With the additional
option of viscoelasticity, the soft tissue characteristics of liver can be reflected in a more comprehensive
way. In Table 2, the parameters of Mooney-Rivlin model of 5-Constant and viscoelastic model of 4-
Constant are determined.

Comment 12: Pp.6, line 6, “Poisson” should be “Poisson’ s”
Response: According to reviewer’s advice, we have modified it correctly.
Reviewer 2
Comment 1: The author mentioned it is difficult to simulate the nonlinearity of soft tissue for position-based
method, actually it has been discussed in [1].

soft tissue deformation. IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics. 20, 268-280.
(10.1109/JBHI.2014.2370059)
Response: Thanks for reviewer’s valuable advice. Actually, what we want to express here is for the
conventional position-based method. Nonlinearity is the relationship between stress and strain. For the
conventional position-based dynamics, there is no force and time considered in the constraint projection step.
As show in the Figure 9 of [1], the directly controlling to the distance between node point is used for fitting
the nonlinearity through the distance-dependent constraint parameters. The gradient of stress and strain curve
is not continuous because of the piecewise function interpolation. Our method integrates viscoelastic and
nonlinear springs into the position-based dynamics to realize the simulation of nonlinearity and
viscoelasticity simultaneous. The integration method also improves the weak point of conventional position-
based dynamics that the deformation effects depend on iteration count.
According to the reviewer’s advice. We try to mention the difference between our method and [1], as follows:
The distance-dependent variable constraint parameter can be used to fit the nonlinearity by
controlling the node position directly [19]. However, due to the lack of time and force parameters in
constraint projection step, the viscoelasticity cannot be integrated into.
The “this method” is modified as “the conventional PBD method”.
Despite its many advantages, the conventional PBD method has two notable problems.
Comment 2: As an attempt for virtual reality, it is necessary to discuss the reaction force in the system.
Response: As the reviewer put it, in virtual surgery system, force feedback can be used to measure the
effectiveness of operation and to enhance the immersion of operators. The “Viscoelasticity and
Nonlinearity” part of Results has clarified that the method proposed in this paper is feasible and effective
in calculating the feedback force. In our virtual laparoscopic cholecystectomy application, the manipulator
is not equipped with force feedback device due to the technical and cost considerations. As with many
commercial systems, such as LAP MENTROTM of 3D SYSTEMS, it also has a version with no force
feedback. So, this section is mainly to illustrate the practicality of the method.
According to reviewer’s advice, the importance of force feedback in virtual surgery systems needs to be
considered. We add it in the Discussion part, as follows:
Also, force feedback plays a significant role in measuring the effectiveness of the operation and
enhancing the immersion of the trainers. Using the method proposed above, the feedback force in the
deformation process can be easily solved by analysing the motion state of mass points. In the future
application, we will add force feedback devices such as servo motors to produce reaction forces on the
medical instrument and study the numerical accuracy of feedback force.
Comment 3: The author claimed the system is real-time, it is better to include the time cost in the paper.
Response: Thanks for reviewer’s comment. Although, in the Table 2, we have mentioned the average time
cost per frame about render, physic and collision which captured by Unity3D profiler. After reconsideration,
we think it is not enough to reflect real-time performance of our method. Because the lack of hardware
information and runtime environment, also the frame rate fluctuations should be taken into account. We have
reworked this section with the above missing information, as follows:
The system runs on a Windows platform with Intel Core i7-7700 CPU @ 3.6 GHz and NVIDIA
GTX 1070 GPU. The program runs in a single thread without multiple thread optimization for
comparing computational costs.
A figure is added to clarify the time cost during the process. The description as follows is added to the
end of the “Virtual laparoscopic cholecystectomy application” part.
In Figure 18, the average time cost per frame of three steps in Figure 17 was recorded. From step
(a) to step (b), and step (b) to step (c), the contacts between instruments and organs are increasing.
Due to collision response, the increase in constraint numbers leads to a slight increase in time cost.
Nevertheless, the total time cost per frame is always below the real-time standard requirements (30
fps). Meanwhile, the fluctuation of time cost during the operation is small.
