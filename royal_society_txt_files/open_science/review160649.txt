This study models conditions that may favour the persistence of genetic polymorphisms for
altruism and selfishness. The paper is timely given the known heritability of altruism and
selfishness, and the increasing empirical evidence for genes that promote altruism. The authors
show that stable polymorphisms require a close balancing of donor costs against recipient
benefits weighted by relatedness. Such balancing is not indicated, however, in empirical
estimates of costs, benefits and relatedness. This outcome gives direction to future genetic
analyses of altruism in quantifying conditions under which one could expect to see
polymorphisms should they exist for altruism/selfishness.
I find the approach largely well explained, and the analysis informative and useful, with
important results in the demonstration of deviations either side of Hamilton’s rule. My comments
below mainly concern the need to improve clarity of presentation.
1. Please avoid dumping references on the reader – 11 in the first sentence of the
Introduction. Here and elsewhere, use fewer, or split the sentence out into several sentences.
When referring directly to a paper, obviously take the author names out of parentheses, or even
double parentheses.
2. The second paragraph of the Introduction appears to refer to theoretical (as opposed to
empirical) work – please clarify. It also suggests that the title of this paper is already a known
result. So where does the novelty lie in this manuscript?
3. Does a gene that encodes for a particular behaviour (e.g., altruism) “make” the organism
behave that way (3rd para of Introduction)? Perhaps better to say that it “promotes” or
“stimulates” a particular behaviour or “supresses” another behaviour, since behaviours will have
multiple genetic and environmental influences on their expression.
4. P3L15-16, “and the size of the sibship is then absorbed into the definitions of the benefit
and cost constants, b and c” … mysteriously. Please explain.
5. Table 1 shows individual fitness payoffs relative to mutual selfishness. To say that it
shows “benefits and costs” (L12) gives a confused message that presupposes the result. The
legend needs to specify that the row defines the donor strategy (which is ‘selfish’ or ‘altruistic’
not ‘altruist’, recognising the individual is only a ‘helper’ if it adopts the altruistic strategy) and
the column defines the recipient’s strategy, in two individuals sampled at random from an
infinite population. Table 1 then refers to the individual fitness payoffs to the row strategy for its
interaction with the column strategy. These payoffs apply regardless of relatedness between
donor and recipient. The recipient therefore should not be specified as a half-sib, since the same
payoffs would apply to a full sib, non-relative, or anybody else. Relatedness influences only the
inclusive fitness payoff, which is accounted for in eqn (2).
6. Supplementary Table A1 legend needs to guide the reader to main-text eqn (1) post-
selection frequencies U', V' and W'. Otherwise the Table A2 legends gives the impression that the
prime refers to the type of allele (dominant or recessive).
7. P3L39, say: “… the frequency of the A allele, p = …, changes each generation by: delta-p
= … (2)”. Please explain the derivation of eqn (2) from eqn (1), rather than saying that it “can be
shown”.
8. P5L30, “the x-axis” – do you mean delta-q = 0?
9. P5L34-35, say “q increasing (p decreasing)”.
10. Figures need referring to in chronological order in the main text – currently the order is

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
Cost, benefit, and relatedness terms are close to the threshold of satisfying Hamilton's rule,
polymorphisms can happen. I find the paper interesting, but the mathematical derivations to be
obscure, and potentially not quite correct.
There seems a crucial step missing in the recursion equation, which the authors write in terms of
p (eq 2), the allelic frequency of A, not genotype frequencies. For the system to actually reduce to
just tracking p, we need to assume random shuffling of alleles after selection, which would
change the full recursion to something different than (2). Otherwise, \Delta p does not give us the
full recursion equation, or the equilibria of the system. The authors actually realize this, because
they say that the equilibrium can be found by setting U'=U etc, but then all the results are given
in terms of \Delta p=0. The authors specifically talk about a stable equilibrium in \Delta p, but I
am really confused by this, since given (as the authors acknowledge) the full recursion equation
has to track genotype frequencies, which is a two-dimensional system, the graphs they plot of
\delta p are meaningless for determining either the equilibria or their stability of the system. In
other words, it is perfectly possible that for a given U, V, W, one has delta p = 0, but delta U, delta
V non-zero, and then the system is just not at an equilibrium.
Unless I am missing something pretty basic, the results in section 3 seem not quite correct to me.
The same issue applies to results in section 4. In particular the following statement on top of page
5 is problematic:
"(Uyenoyama and Feldman, 1981) did not distinguish stable from unstable equilibria, but these
can be distinguished because the first equilibrium encountered by a favoured allele entering a
population is bound to be stable. "
U&F is a bit dense, but they do take into account that the diploid model is a two-dimensional
system (they solve two equations simultaneously). To determine the stability of an equilibrium in
a two-dimensional system, they'd have to look at the eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix, as I
wrote above. Incidentally, even in one dimension, the authors' statement is not correct, since
technically, the dynamics here are discrete, so stability actually requires that |dp'/dp| < 1, so the
"first equilibrium encountered" cannot assumed to be stable (unlike in continuous dynamics).
4
In short, I find the paper needlessly opaque, and quite possibly mathematically wrong. The
authors do a very half-hearted job at explaining their derivations. And it seems like since
Uyenoyama and Feldman actually analyzed a more general version of this system (with
incomplete dominance) about 45 years ago, it seems to me the authors can afford to be clearer
(another way of saying it is: if the paper written 45 yrs after U&F is not clearer than the latter
even to a theorist, maybe not enough effort was put in to be clear). It might be this obscurity that's
making me miss something, but it also seems to me that the results here about stability and
equilibria are not quite correct.
Overall, the question is interesting, but the paper needs more clarity of derivations and
potentially some correction. A way to get around this problem might be to just use more
simulations (as in Figure 1, especially since the authors focus on numerical results anyway), but
present them (and evaluate stability) in the simplex as they should be.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
My comment in the first version was that the derivation of the model was obscure, and perhaps
because of that, some of the analysis in fact appeared to be incorrect. Specifically, I was puzzled
by the authors assertion that the dynamics can be reduced to a single dimension (in p, or
equivalently q), despite their model (which is identical to the Uyenoyama and Feldman paper)
depending on all genotype frequencies, so is in principle 2-dimensional. The authors in their
reply counter that because they assume random mating, the genotype frequencies are given by
their Hardy-Weinberg frequencies, so knowing p is enough to describe the system. They also
assert this on line 24 of page 4. But that argument is demonstrably false, as I try to explain below.
I apologize if I seem pedantic, but I believe in avoiding incorrect statements in papers.
The lifecycle the authors model proceeds as follows (it would be helpful to give this lifecycle
explicitly): Start with an adult population with genotype frequencies U,V,W. Assume random
mating, and each adult producing two juveniles offspring. Juveniles survive to adulthood as a
function of their and their sibling's genotype. The authors census the population after this
viability selection stage, i.e., for adults before mating. So, contrary to their assertion, the genotype
frequencies after selection cannot be given by U'=(p+delta p)^2, and V'=2 (p+delta p)(q+delta q),
since random mating hasn't happened yet. (One can also verify this using equations 1a and 1b
(which are correct): if it were true, we'd have U'=(U'+V'/2)^2 where U', V' are given by 1a and 1b.
One can easily check numerically this doesn't hold.)
The reason the system cannot be reduced to a single dimension (p) is as follows: in the lifecycle
above, while the genotype frequencies in the juvenile offspring before selection is given by the
Hardy-Weinberg frequencies, selection is a function of sibling genotypes, which are a function of
the genotype frequencies in the parental generation, which are NOT at H-W frequencies. The
authors assertion makes me think that they think they census the population at the juvenile stage,
but that does not give them a dynamically sufficient model (without the genotype distribution of
the parents, they can't write down the fitnesses of the juveniles). A demonstration of
9
consequences of the two-dimensionality of the system is in the attached pdf printout of a
Mathematica file I used to reproduce the authors' results.
Incidentally, the authors don't seem to realize if their argument were true, it would actually
prove fatal to their paper, since the argument in the paragraph on p 4 starting w/ line 28 would
simply not apply. After just one iteration, the frequency of heterozygote parents V would be
equal to 2pq, hence the direction of selection in equation 2 would simply be given by Hamilton's
rule with no frequency dependence, so no possibility of polymorphisms.
Hence, I stand by my initial comment: the description of the model is not correct. Now, this is
actually good news for the authors, as I mention above. The equations 1 and 2 seem correct; and I
was able to reproduce Figure 1 following their methodology (but again, there is no way to write a
recursion equations purely in terms of p, contrary to what the authors assert). And indeed there
is a stable internal equilibrium, which is not inconsistent with what I've been saying.
Interestingly, playing around with the model in Mathematica, it seems that the authors
unwittingly hit upon a workable approximation of the system using one dimension (one that fails
close to boundaries of different basins of attraction, and possibly also for very strong selection
that would create high excess of deficit of heterozygotes). That is worth exploring.
But at a minimum, the authors have to make sure they explain their model to the reader correctly.
Spelling out the lifecycle explicitly should help. I think they could get away with just numerical
analyses as they do now, but they should be careful to refrain from graphs like Figure 1B that
imply there is a one-dimensional system whose equilibria and stability can be inferred from a one
dimensional flow diagram. (See Appendix B.)

was able to reproduce Figure 1 following their methodology (but again, there is no way to write a
recursion equations purely in terms of p, contrary to what the authors assert). And indeed there
is a stable internal equilibrium, which is not inconsistent with what I've been saying.
Interestingly, playing around with the model in Mathematica, it seems that the authors
unwittingly hit upon a workable approximation of the system using one dimension (one that fails
close to boundaries of different basins of attraction, and possibly also for very strong selection
that would create high excess of deficit of heterozygotes). That is worth exploring.
But at a minimum, the authors have to make sure they explain their model to the reader correctly.
Spelling out the lifecycle explicitly should help. I think they could get away with just numerical
analyses as they do now, but they should be careful to refrain from graphs like Figure 1B that
imply there is a one-dimensional system whose equilibria and stability can be inferred from a one
dimensional flow diagram.

This is the third time I am reviewing the ms, and we haven't gotten past the first issue I raised,
which is that the authors seem to mischaracterize the dimensionality of the paper. They insist (in
this version, locally near equilibria), that it can be reduced to a single dimension. That claim
might be true (I suspect it has more to do with weak selection than being near equilibria, for
which case there is actually a proof in Roze and Rousset, 2004, AmNat), but the fact remains that
the authors don't show it.
The authors reply in this round consists of that the direction of change in p^2 is the same as p,
and assert without proof that therefore near equilibria the system can be reduced to a single
dimension. The fact about p^2 is of course trivially true of every conceivable model (and not just
near equilibria) since the p^2 is a strictly increasing function for p>0. But it's also irrelevant.
Again, in the authors' model, allele frequencies *after selection* in the previous generation affect
selection in the current generation. So, the relevant genotype frequency to keep track of for
computing selection at time t is not p^2_{t-1} which is the genotype frequencies before viability
selection, but what the genotype frequencies become after viability selection. And that of course
is going to be different than p^2_{t-1}.
In any case, I feel we are beyond the point I can be useful. If the authors see fit to publish this
paper as is and the editors concur, it is fine by me. In fairness, it has to be said that the authors
seem to have coded up their recursion equations correctly despite believing some weird things
about their model. Therefore, as far as I can tell, the numerical results are sound, and at the end of
the day, all they have are numerical results anyway. I tried to improve their exposition of the
model, but since they seem to resist that, there isn't much I can do.

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-160649.R2)
Dear Editor
We are pleased our ms is accepted subject to minor revision in accordance with the referee's
suggestion. We have considered the referee's comment carefully. In fact (s)he does not make any
new suggestions for further change. We have already dealt with his or her earlier criticisms some
of which are repeated in the present comment. In particular we completely agree that in general
the dynamics cannot be reduced to a single dimension. That is why the genotype frequency V
appears in equation 2. And we have emphasised in the caption to Fig. 1 that the diagram should
not be taken to imply that the system is everywhere one-dimensional.
I am uploading the revised ms.

We are very grateful to the reviewers for their helpful comments. Our responses appear below after
the > sign.
Reviewer: 1
This study models conditions that may favour the persistence of genetic polymorphisms for altruism
and selfishness. The paper is timely given the known heritability of altruism and selfishness, and the
increasing empirical evidence for genes that promote altruism. The authors show that stable
polymorphisms require a close balancing of donor costs against recipient benefits weighted by
relatedness. Such balancing is not indicated, however, in empirical estimates of costs, benefits and
relatedness. This outcome gives direction to future genetic analyses of altruism in quantifying
conditions under which one could expect to see polymorphisms should they exist for
altruism/selfishness.
I find the approach largely well explained, and the analysis informative and useful, with important
results in the demonstration of deviations either side of Hamilton’s rule. My comments below
mainly concern the need to improve clarity of presentation.
1. Please avoid dumping references on the reader – 11 in the first sentence of the Introduction.
Here and elsewhere, use fewer, or split the sentence out into several sentences. When referring
directly to a paper, obviously take the author names out of parentheses, or even double
parentheses.
> We have split into two sentences as requested, and elsewhere removed some references. We do
like to give all relevant references where we consider it important to provide them, to assist
interested readers in finding the papers we have found important. We apologise for the the author
names being in parentheses. This is the output of the Endnote referencing system that we used. It is
readily corrected by printers.
2. The second paragraph of the Introduction appears to refer to theoretical (as opposed to
empirical) work – please clarify. It also suggests that the title of this paper is already a known result.
So where does the novelty lie in this manuscript?
> It does refer to the theoretical work, this has now been clarified. The novelty of the paper lies
mainly in its characterisation of the quantitative conditions that give rise to stable polymorphisms,
as indicated at the start of the final para of the Introduction. We could explain this in the title of the
paper – but prefer the more succinct title we have at present.
3. Does a gene that encodes for a particular behaviour (e.g., altruism) “make” the organism
behave that way (3rd para of Introduction)? Perhaps better to say that it “promotes” or “stimulates”
a particular behaviour or “supresses” another behaviour, since behaviours will have multiple genetic
and environmental influences on their expression.
> Changed to “promote” as suggested.
4. P3L15-16, “and the size of the sibship is then absorbed into the definitions of the benefit and
cost constants, b and c” … mysteriously. Please explain.
benefits and costs of all interactions with relevant relatives”.
5. Table 1 shows individual fitness payoffs relative to mutual selfishness. To say that it shows
“benefits and costs” (L12) gives a confused message that presupposes the result. The legend needs
to specify that the row defines the donor strategy (which is ‘selfish’ or ‘altruistic’ not ‘altruist’,
recognising the individual is only a ‘helper’ if it adopts the altruistic strategy) and the column defines
the recipient’s strategy, in two individuals sampled at random from an infinite population. Table 1
then refers to the individual fitness payoffs to the row strategy for its interaction with the column
strategy. These payoffs apply regardless of relatedness between donor and recipient. The recipient
therefore should not be specified as a half-sib, since the same payoffs would apply to a full sib, non-
relative, or anybody else. Relatedness influences only the inclusive fitness payoff, which is accounted
for in eqn (2).
> Many thanks for this. Caption rewritten along the lines suggested.
6. Supplementary Table A1 legend needs to guide the reader to main-text eqn (1) post-
selection frequencies U', V' and W'. Otherwise the Table A2 legends gives the impression that the
prime refers to the type of allele (dominant or recessive).
> This is helpful. We have inserted the needed guidance in the first para of Supplementary material;
and it does also occur in the sentence before equations 1.
7. P3L39, say: “… the frequency of the A allele, p = …, changes each generation by: delta-p = …
(2)”. Please explain the derivation of eqn (2) from eqn (1), rather than saying that it “can be shown”.
> we have inserted <U+0394>p =U’+V’/2 – U-V/2 to show what has to be done. The detailed algebra is
lengthy but elementary so we prefer to save space by not giving the individual steps.
8. P5L30, “the x-axis” – do you mean delta-q = 0?
> Yes. Text now clarified.
9. P5L34-35, say “q increasing (p decreasing)”.
> Text changed as suggested.
10. Figures need referring to in chronological order in the main text – currently the order is Fig.
2 D, C, A, B, E, F.
> Changed as suggested.
Comments to the Author(s)
cost, benefit, and relatedness terms are close to the threshold of satisfying Hamilton's rule,
polymorphisms can happen. I find the paper interesting, but the mathematical derivations to be
obscure, and potentially not quite correct.
There seems a crucial step missing in the recursion equation, which the authors write in terms of p
(eq 2), the allelic frequency of A, not genotype frequencies.
> The referee is correct that genotype frequencies are needed. These are represented in Equation 2
by the genotype frequency V. The other genotype frequencies do not appear explicitly because they
have been expressed in terms of p, q and V.
For the system to actually reduce to just tracking p, we need to assume random shuffling of alleles
after selection, which would change the full recursion to something different than (2).
> We do assume assume random mating and therefore random shuffling of alleles after selection.
With this assumption equation (2) is correct.
Otherwise, \Delta p does not give us the full recursion equation, or the equilibria of the system. The
authors actually realize this, because they say that the equilibrium can be found by setting U'=U etc,
but then all the results are given in terms of \Delta p=0. The authors specifically talk about a stable
equilibrium in \Delta p, but I am really confused by this, since given (as the authors acknowledge)
the full recursion equation has to track genotype frequencies, which is a two-dimensional system,
the graphs they plot of \delta p are meaningless for determining either the equilibria or their
stability of the system. In other words, it is perfectly possible that for a given U, V, W, one has delta
p = 0, but delta U, delta V non-zero, and then the system is just not at an equilibrium.
> We do have the full recursion as noted above. We did wonder early on whether initial genotype
frequencies would affect the trajectory, but discovered that when we use equation 2 to track the
genotype frequencies, the trajectories converge within a few generations whatever the initial
genotype frequencies. So Figures 1 and A1 do give an accurate representation of what happens
whatever the initial genotype frequencies. We now make these points in the first paragraph of
section 3. When <U+0394>p = 0 the genotypic frequencies measured after random mating and before
selection are necessarily in equilibrium because they depend entirely on the value of p. We have also
rewritten the sentences either side of equation (2) to clarify this point.
Unless I am missing something pretty basic, the results in section 3 seem not quite correct to me.
The same issue applies to results in section 4.
> We hope we have resolved these worries.
In particular the following statement on top of page 5 is problematic:
"(Uyenoyama and Feldman, 1981) did not distinguish stable from unstable equilibria, but these can
be distinguished because the first equilibrium encountered by a favoured allele entering a
population is bound to be stable. "
(they solve two equations simultaneously). To determine the stability of an equilibrium in a two-
dimensional system, they'd have to look at the eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix, as I wrote above.
Incidentally, even in one dimension, the authors' statement is not correct, since technically, the
dynamics here are discrete, so stability actually requires that |dp'/dp| < 1, so the "first equilibrium
encountered" cannot assumed to be stable (unlike in continuous dynamics).
> We are confident that Figures 1 and A1 do give an accurate representation of what happens, for
the reasons described above, so we do not see how our analysis could mislead. All that matters is
the direction of change in sign of <U+0394>p on either side of <U+0394>p=0. We accept that there are more
sophisticated analytical methods available than ours, but we prefer to leave it to others to apply
them.
In short, I find the paper needlessly opaque, and quite possibly mathematically wrong. The authors
do a very half-hearted job at explaining their derivations. And it seems like since Uyenoyama and
Feldman actually analyzed a more general version of this system (with incomplete dominance) about
45 years ago, it seems to me the authors can afford to be clearer (another way of saying it is: if the
paper written 45 yrs after U&F is not clearer than the latter even to a theorist, maybe not enough
effort was put in to be clear). It might be this obscurity that's making me miss something, but it also
seems to me that the results here about stability and equilibria are not quite correct.
> We hope we have clarified our derivations. Some of the algebraic details are lengthy but
elementary and it would be invidious to give all of them, but of course helpful pointers must be
included whereever possible. We hope we have now provided them.
Overall, the question is interesting, but the paper needs more clarity of derivations and potentially
some correction. A way to get around this problem might be to just use more simulations (as in
Figure 1, especially since the authors focus on numerical results anyway), but present them (and
evaluate stability) in the simplex as they should be.
> As indicated above we have carried out far more simulations than shown, and we are confident
that our results present a true representation of what is going on.

Now we can demonstrate that the 1-dimensional treatment of the system is inappropriate. Take the
seemingly unstable equilibrium in p in Figure 1b. We will show that starting from the same allele fre-
quency, one can arrive at different equilibria depending on the genotype distributions. The parameter <U+03D5>
below is the fraction of the cooperation allele that initially sits in heterozygotes. When q=0.78 and <U+03D5>=1,
selfishness fixes (q goes 1). Starting with the same q but setting <U+03D5>=0, cooperation is maintained (q goes
to the internal equilibrium). The reason is that the initial heterozygote excess or deficit makes the fre-
quency jump up or down, putting it in one or the other basin of attraction. The effect of the heterozygote
excess happens to be numerically small and becomes significant near the boundary separating the
basins of attractions, so it could be said that the authors hit upon a workable approximation.

We are very grateful to the referee for his interest in our results. His comments have led us to
considerably sharpen our thinking on stability.
We completely agree that in general the dynamics cannot be reduced to a single dimension. That is
why the genotype frequency V appears in equation 2.
The remaining issue is whether local (not global) stability in the neighbourhood of an equilibrium can
be analysed in one dimension, or whether two are needed. The paragraph that causes problems is
the one after equation 2. We sincerely apologise for our misleading use there of the U’, V’, W’
notation in our last version. We had intended this to refer to frequency in the next generation after
random mating, but we had already used the notation in a different sense in equations 1.
We do still believe that local stability can be analysed using a one-dimensional analysis. We have
revised the para after equation 2 to justify our position as follows:
“Although it might be thought that determination of local stability would require a two-dimensional
analysis in terms of changes in U and W (remember V = 1 – U – W), in fact a one-dimensional
analysis is sufficient. To see this note that the frequency of the AA genotype after random mating
but before selection is pt2 in generation t, and so the change in a generation is pt+12- pt 2=( pt+1- pt)(
pt+1+ pt). Therefore the change in the frequency of AA near equilibria always has the same sign as
the change in allele frequency, ( pt+1- pt). Similarly the change in the frequency of SS at equilibria has
the same sign as qt+1- qt = pt - pt+1. Hence the frequencies of the AA and SS genotypes (and by
implication that of AS) return to equilibrium if and only if p does. Hence the local stability or
otherwise of the genotypic frequencies is as for the allele frequencies and so the local stability can
be described in terms of one not two dimensions. Only if the perturbations to the equilibrium are
large enough to take the allele frequencies beyond the unstable equilibrium and hence to fixation
will the one dimensional argument not hold.”
Thus we are now explicit that we are referring to local stability. The referee’s examples with extreme
perturbations in the proportion of A alleles at an unstable equilibrium in heterozygotes results as he
says in leap frogging into zones of attraction of other equilibria and are more than local
perturbations. But in reality movements of genotypic frequencies near equilibria are very small. We
hope that the qualification of local stability and the mention of the exception of perturbations taking
allele frequencies into the zones of attraction of other equilibria is sufficient qualification of our
results.
In response to the remaining comments in the referee’s last paragraph:
Selection happens on juveniles before mating, and adults mate at random in our model. We have
inserted a sentence in the first paragraph of section 2 to clarify this point.
Figure 1B shows changes in q per generation calculated iteratively from initial frequencies given by
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with q = 0.01. The referee is correct that the diagram should not be
taken to imply that the system is everywhere one-dimensional. This figure was produced by iterative
calculation updating genotype frequencies each generation. We have inserted a sentence into the
figure caption to make this point. However as stated in the first paragraph of section 3, although
initial genotype frequencies affect the trajectories in Figs 1 and A1, trajectories with specified values
of b and c were found to converge within a few generations whatever the initial genotype
initial genotype frequencies.
