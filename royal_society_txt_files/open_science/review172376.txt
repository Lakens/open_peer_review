In this study the authors identify that miR-143 and miR-145 have lower expression in CA samples
when compared to keratinocytes. The also show that miR-143 and miR-145 can directly target
NRAS and in doing so can regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis in HPV-infected cells. There
are a few points, however, which need to be addressed and are described below:
1) This paper is very poorly written and is not fit for publication in this form. The paper needs to
be rewritten for clarity.
2) Several references are missing. For example, Page 3 Line 8.
3) The authors should comment on why they did not observe the expected enhancement of both
cellular proliferation and apoptosis in SiHa cells or HaCaT cells when only transfected with
candidate miRNA mimics or inhibitors. This is unusual. The authors should consider knocking
out miR-143 and miR-145 by CRISPR/cas9 and repeat the experiments to rule out any secondary
effect caused by nutlin-3a on the data presented.

Dear Dr Ruan,
The editors assigned to your paper ("miR-143 and miR-145 target NRAS contribute in cell
proliferation and apoptosis in condyloma acuminatum") have now received comments from
reviewers.
Reviewer 1 raises some important and substantive issues. First, the clarity and writing of the
paper needs to be improved, and it would be useful if you enlisted additional help to improve the
writing and legibility of the paper. Second, and very importantly, it is important to consider point
3 of this reviewer, who suggests additional work to validate your conclusions. We would like you
to revise your paper in accordance with the referee and Associate Editor suggestions which can
be found below (not including confidential reports to the Editor). Please note this decision does
not guarantee eventual acceptance.
Please submit a copy of your revised paper within three weeks (i.e. by the 10-Mar-2018). If we do
not hear from you within this time then it will be assumed that the paper has been withdrawn. In
exceptional circumstances, extensions may be possible if agreed with the Editorial Office in
advance.We do not allow multiple rounds of revision so we urge you to make every effort to
fully address all of the comments at this stage. If deemed necessary by the Editors, your
manuscript will be sent back to one or more of the original reviewers for assessment. If the
original reviewers are not available, we may invite new reviewers.

Associate Editor's comments (Professor Jürg Bähler):
Both reviewers highlight a few issues with respect to writing, data presentation and discussion
that should be addressed in a revised version. It would be good to provide some more context for
the reader. For example, the beginning of the Results and Discussion are quite abrupt and hard to
follow.

In this study the authors identify that miR-143 and miR-145 have lower
expression in CA samples when compared to keratinocytes. The also
show that miR-143 and miR-145 can directly target NRAS and in doing
so can regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis in HPV-infected cells.
There are a few points, however, which need to be addressed and are
described below:
1) This paper is very poorly written and is not fit for publication in this
form. The paper needs to be rewritten for clarity.
A: In order to clarify our opinions more clearly, we have rewritten
our paper (Please see the revision with track). Furthermore, this
paper was edited to improve our academic English writing by
Elsevier Language Editing Service (Please see the certification from
Elsevier).
In addition, to better clarify the probable regulatory mechanism of
miR-143 or miR-145, we detected the level of involved proteins in
PI3K/AKT pathway, including PI3K-p110a PI3K-p110ß, pAKT and
AKT.
2) Several references are missing. For example, Page 3 Line 8.
A: We have rewritten our paper and adjusted the references.
3) The authors should comment on why they did not observe the
expected enhancement of both cellular proliferation and apoptosis in
SiHa cells or HaCaT cells when only transfected with candidate miRNA
mimics or inhibitors. This is unusual. The authors should consider
knocking out miR-143 and miR-145 by CRISPR/cas9 and repeat the
experiments to rule out any secondary effect caused by nutlin-3a on the
data presented.
A: Thank you very much for this suggestion.
In our experience with miRNAs, we notice that several miRNAs
sometimes play a mild role and provide synergistic effects combined
with other treatments. In order to observe the direct effect of miR-
143 and miR-145, on the one hand, we followed your suggestion to
knock out miR-143 and miR-145 by CRISPR/CAS9 and repeated the
relative experiments; on the other hand, we use lentiviral vectors for
delivering pre-miRNAs for overexpression of miR-143 and miR-145.
Furthermore, this time we chose SiHa cells and primary HEKs
(human epidermal keratinocytes), but not HaCaT cells, as the cell
experimental models, to enhance sensitivity to miRNAs. In these
additional experiments, although still be mild, we observed the direct
effect of miR-143 and miR-145 on SiHa cells or HEKs (Please see the
revision).
It has been shown previously that the NRAS/PI3K/AKT pathway
usually has an anti-apoptotic role to promote cellular proliferation,
partly due to AKT-dependent stabilization of MDM2. Thus,targeting
both the NRAS/PI3K/AKT and P53 axes simultaneously might be
particularly effective in cancer cells. Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT
pathway sensitized cells to nutlin-3a, an MDM2 antagonist and p53
activator. Therefore, in the revision, we still repeated the related
experiments co-treated with nutlin-3a.
