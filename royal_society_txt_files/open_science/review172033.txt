In the manuscript, authors fabricated a tightly attached PDA-assisted Fe3O4 nanoparticles
coating on Ti with magnetic properties, aiming to improve the osteogenesis of the Ti substrates.
Cell attachment and proliferation rate of the hBMSCs on the Ti surface were significantly
improved with the Fe3O4/PDA coating when compared to the pure Ti without coatings. The
results revealed that the present PDA-assisted Fe3O4 nanoparticles surface coating would be an
innovative method for Ti surface modification and showed great potential for clinical application.
The work is interesting, I can recommend its publication after a minor revision.
1. In the preparation of Fe3O4, authors are how to control the size and shape, because the size
and shape can affect the clinical application.
2. In the SEM images( Fig.4C, Fig.4D), I cannot agree author description. Please give clear figures.

In this manuscript, the authors prepared Fe3O4/PDA-coated Ti and demonstrated that the PDA-
assisted Fe3O4 nanoparticles coating surface immobilization strategy could endow the modified
titanium substrates with significant osteogenesis activity. Although the authors do the work
carefully, this work is not adequately justified for publication with respect to its technical aspect.
The data are not sufficient to support their conclusions. More solid evidence and characterization
should be supplemented to enrich the whole structure of the manuscript. So the manuscript
needs further major modification to address the following issues:
1) This manuscript is not written seriously. Such as Fe3O4 and Fe3O4 both exist in this

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Michael Doube):
Comments to the Author:
Dear Dr Huang,
Thank you for you submission to RSOS. Three reviewers have seen your manuscript and have
comments that must be addressed for a revision to be considered further. In particular the
mechanism by which magnetism effects an osteogenic cell behaviour is not clear, and the control
of the nanoparticle formation and adsorption is not convincing to the reviewers. The manuscript
will require editing for English prior to eventual acceptance; this can be done in a final round of
revisions should the reviewers be satisfied with the scientific content.
Please accept my apologies for the delay in returning reviews to you; it has been a challenge to
find reviewers.
Kind regards,

Dear Editor and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our
manuscript entitled "Enhanced in vitro biocompatibility and osteogenesis of
titanium immobilized with dopamine-assisted superparamagnetic Fe3O4
nanoparticles for hBMSCs". Those comments are all valuable and very helpful
for revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding
significance to our researches. We have studied comments carefully and have
made correction which we hope to meet with approval. Revised portion are
marked in red in the paper. The main corrections in the paper and the responds
to the reviewer’s comments are as flowing:
Replies to Reviewer 1
1. please provide figure about LIVE/DEAD staining of BMSCs cells after
culturing for 1,3 and 7 days.
Respond: Thanks for the reminder. We have provided the figures about
LIVE/DEAD staining of BMSCs cells after culturing for 1,3 and 7 days. (Fig.

2.Why your result shows that cell proliferation was promoted by the PDA-
assisted Fe3O4 nanoparticles coating on the titanium substrates, please provide
further date or discussion about the mechanism.
Respond: Thank for the suggestion. As suggested by the reviewer, a discussion
of the possibility of the mechanism has been included (Manuscript Revised,
page15, last paragraph and page16, first paragraph).

1. In the preparation of Fe3O4, authors are how to control the size and shape,
because the size and shape can affect the clinical application.
Respond: We apologize for the lack of clarity. The uniform Fe3O4 nanoparticles
were prepared by a modified hydro-thermal method reported by Gao et al(Gao
J, Ran X, Shi C, Cheng H, Cheng T, Su Y. One-step solvothermal synthesis of
highly water-soluble, negatively charged superparamagnetic Fe3O4 colloidal
nanocrystal clusters. Nanoscale 2013; 5(15): 7026-33.)PSSMA was used to
control the formation of sub-micrometer sized structures during the hydrolysis
and reduction reactions of ferric chloride hexahydrate in the presence of sodium
acetate in ethylene glycol. The results in the paper of Gao et al showed that the
size uniformity and colloidal stability were strongly dependent on the amount of
PSSMA and ferric chloride hexahydrate used.
2. In the SEM images ( Fig.4C, Fig.4D), I cannot agree author description.
Please give clear figures.
Respond: We are very sorry for our negligence of putting the indistinct figure of
Fig.4C and Fig.4D. We have changed the clear figures and redrawn figure 4. We
also have revised the description of the SEM images (Fig.4) (Manuscript Revised,
page10, first paragraph).
Replies to Reviewer 3
Comments to the Author(s)
In this manuscript, the authors prepared Fe3O4/PDA-coated Ti and
demonstrated that the PDA-assisted Fe3O4 nanoparticles coating surface
immobilization strategy could endow the modified titanium substrates with
significant osteogenesis activity. Although the authors do the work carefully,
this work is not adequately justified for publication with respect to its technical
aspect. The data are not sufficient to support their conclusions. More solid
evidence and characterization should be supplemented to enrich the whole
structure of the manuscript. So the manuscript needs further major modification
to address the following issues:
1) This manuscript is not written seriously. Such as Fe3O4 and Fe3O4 both
exist in this manuscript. And the English written should be improved.
Respond: We are very sorry for our misspelling, we have fixed the mistake in
text. Moreover, we have sent the manuscript to a language editing company to
re-edit the language.
2) In this manuscript, according to the reported work, the author proposed that
“Magnetic properties are considered to be an effective stimulator of cell
proliferation, migration, and differentiation, which could be used to repair
and heal damaged tissues.” However, in the result and discussion the author
did not proved the relation between the magnetic property and the
osteogenesis activity.
Respond: Thanks for the reminder. It is a constructive suggestion. Some detailed
discussions associated with the relation between the magnetic property and the
osteogenesis activity were supplemented in the revised article ( Manuscript
Revised, from page14, last paragraph to the end of the discussion.)
3) The author proposed that the improved osteogenesis activity was ascribed to
surface the increased wettability and roughness due to the presence of Fe3O4
nanoparticles. If so, why not use other nanoparticles.
Respond: We are sorry that we did not demonstrated our design clearly. The
results showed that the presence of Fe3O4 nanoparticles could promote
proliferation and differentiation of hBMSCs. We speculated the mechanism
behind such results might due to the synergistic role of Fe3O4 nanoparticles,
such as wettability, roughness and magnetic properties. We will include this
explanation in discussion section.
4) In the experimental part, the authors put Fe3O4 nanopaticles, dopamine and
pTi samples together, according to our experiences, most PDA coated Fe3O4
nanoparticles would be formed in the solution which could not absorbed onto the
pTi samples. I think the method used here is not a good application for absorbing
Fe3O4 nanoparticles on pTi samples.
Respond: Thanks for the reminder. It is an interesting comment. We have also
encountered similar problems at the preliminary experiment. If we just put the
pTi samples immerse into the solutions for 24 h at room temperature in static
state. Just as the suggestion by the reviewer, most PDA coated Fe3O4
nanoparticles would be formed in the solution while could not absorbed onto the
pTi samples. Nevertheless, pTi samples and solutions were placed in
thermostatic shaker at room temperature at 150rpm, the problem is solved. The
one-pot surface immobilization strategy proposed by Kang et al is applicable not
only to versatile materials but also chemical functionalities. ( Kang SM, Hwang
NS, Yeom J, et al. One-Step Multipurpose Surface Functionalization by
Adhesive Catecholamine. Adv Funct Mater 2012; 22(14): 2949-55.)
Anyway, according to the result of SEM, EDS, EDS mapping and VSM,
we did develop a PDA-assisted Fe3O4 nanoparticles surface modification
strategy which is tight and integrated magnetic properties for titanium substrates.

We have made correction carefully which we hope to meet with approval.
Revised portion are marked in red in the paper. The main corrections in the
paper and the responds to the reviewer’s comments are as flowing:
Replies to Editor:
1.AFM is 'atomic force microscopy'
Respond: We are very sorry for our misspelling, we have fixed the mistake in
text.
2.One reviewer questions the 'h' in hBMSC, and asks that you use this
abbreviation consistently. Presumably h stands for human; if that is the case,
please make it explicit.
Respond: Thanks for the suggestion. The “h” stands for human, we have fixed
the mistake in text and made the abbr. words (hBMSCs) consistent with each
other.
Replies to Reviewer 1
1. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs)<U+FF1F>where is h<U+FF1F>
Respond: Thanks for the reminder. We are very sorry for our misspelling, we
have fixed the mistake in text. The “hBMSCs” mean human bone
mesenchymal stem cells.
2. The abbr words should be consistent with each other. hBMSCs? BMSCs?
Respond: We apologize for the lack of clarity. We have made the abbr words
(hBMSCs) consistent with each other.
