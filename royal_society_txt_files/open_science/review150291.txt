There is a flaw in your work that can be corrected fairly quickly and easily. The classification of
the responses must be done blind. The scorer must not be aware of the treatment. I could not tell
if this was the case. Otherwise the experimental design and implementation are solid.

This is an interesting and timely study. I am not clear about just when the playback presentations
were initiated. Were the playbacks run continuously or only when a moth was in an appropriate
position to hear the recordings? How do the authors know that the moths heard the playbacks?
Some clarity in this area would make it easier for the reader to understand the results. The
authors allude to this situation on lines 42-45.
How did the response rates of the moths in the LED treatment compare to similar data with
other light sources? The answer to this question might inform planners about which types of
lights had more (or less) impact on the defensive behaviour of the moths. This could be important
because social reasons that justify the installation and operation of lighting.
Understandably, the authors do not have data about moths that "heard" the bats and just flew
away without approaching the lighted area (an argument for not running the playbacks
continously). The issue of the impact of lighting on moth behaviour is raised in lines 137-144.
These things being said, I really appreciated the comment (line 170-172) that the moths might
have behaved as if they were flying in daylight.

The context of the studycould be more adequately established by stating why you expected LED
lights to have a different effect on moth predator avoidance behaviour to that of more traditional
artificial lighting. This should also be part of the Discussion (lines 164-165). Please present the
data on the bat activity monitoring witht the secondary detector to provide evidence that
categories 1 and 3 were in fact devoid of bat echolocation. This is important because the
experiment was done in the field and raises the possibility that the results may be an artefact of
wild bats intruding upon the treatments.
SPECIFIC COMMENTS
Line 85: For completeness, state whether the species of bats from which recordings were made
are known to feed on eared moths or at least that their echolocation calls are audible to moths.

How did you know that a moth actually heard the playback? If the answer is recognizing the
defensive behaviour of the moths, how do you know a non response was failure to hear (perhaps
a deaf moth -- could be something in an individual (like ear mites) or a species lacking ears).
Until the reader knows how you established that the moth(s) heard the playback, then the
question about who heard what, when, remains open.
"Macro moth" means what? Do you refer to the Macrolepidoptera? If so, say so. It almost
looks as though you need to know what species of moths you tested. Probably you do not know
this for all the moths, but it would help if you could be specific with some ... then you data set
would be more detailed and the results easier to interpret.
The idea behind the paper is interesting, but the revised version leaves me more confused
than I was by the first version.
What if you confine your results to the moths that responded (perhaps you can name some),
you can move out of the tangle... This would deal with the "how do you know the moth heard the
bat"

The authors have not allayed my concern about whether or not the moths they studied could
hear bats. Saying that some large percentage of species of moths in the UK are said to have ears
do not mean anything... and this is without pondering the possibility that some moths with ears
also have infestations of mites perhaps rendering one or both ears dysfunctional or at least much
less sensitive to bat echolocation signals.

Manuscript ID RSOS-140532.R1
Dear Emilie Aimé,
We are pleased that the reviewers recognise that our manuscript ‘LED street
lights reduce macro-moths’ last-ditch evasive manoeuvres to bat
echolocation calls’ (formerly ‘LED street lights reduce last-ditch evasive
manoeuvres to bat echolocation calls by moths’) represents "an interesting
and timely study” and that overall our “experimental design and
implementation are solid”. We thank all the reviewers for their helpful and
constructive comments. A breakdown of our responses to each reviewer is
provided in red italics below.
Reviewer 1:
1. I am not clear about just when the playback presentations were initiated.
Were the playbacks run continuously or only when a moth was in an
appropriate position to hear the recordings?
Playbacks were initiated once moths were flying within five metres of
the street light column and within five metres of the speaker (see lines
123 - 124). At this range moths were in an appropriate position to hear
the playback recordings and the intensity of the recordings was loud
enough (based on existing research) to induce moth powerdive
behaviour. For clarity, we have now included the sentence ‘Each
playback presentation was initiated once a moth was within 5 m of the
speaker and therefore in an appropriate position to hear the
recordings.’ (Lines 124 - 126).
2. How do the authors know that the moths heard the playbacks? Some
clarity in this area would make it easier for the reader to understand the
results. The authors allude to this situation on lines 42-45.
For playback experiments we used bat call frequencies and intensities
audible to tympanate moths. This is explained in the text (see lines
123 - 137, and our response to comment 1 above).
3. How did the response rates of the moths in the LED treatment compare to
similar data with other light sources? The answer to this question might
inform planners about which types of lights had more (or less) impact on the
defensive behaviour of the moths. This could be important because social
reasons that justify the installation and operation of lighting.
We have made reference to this in our discussion (see lines 177 -
182). The reduction in response rate of moths under LED lighting used
in our experiment is similar to that observed under MV lighting in other
studies. However, MV lights emit large amounts of UV light which is
especially attractive to moths. It is therefore interesting that the
reduction in escape behaviour is still present in the absence of UV
light.
4. Understandably, the authors do not have data about moths that "heard"
the bats and just flew away without approaching the lighted area (an
argument for not running the playbacks continuously). The issue of the
impact of lighting on moth behaviour is raised in lines 137-144. These things
being said, I really appreciated the comment (line 170-172) that the moths
might have behaved as if they were flying in daylight.
To clarify, playback presentations were not run continuously, therefore
individual moths will only have heard bat call playbacks once in the
lighted area (see comment 1 above). Other moths may have heard
these bat calls outside the lighted area and responded, but this is not
relevant to our study, which was to investigate how LED lights affected
the predator-avoidance behaviour of moths.
Reviewer 2:
1. There is a flaw in your work that can be corrected fairly quickly and easily.
The classification of the responses must be done blind. The scorer must not
be aware of the treatment. I could not tell if this was the case. Otherwise the
experimental design and implementation are solid.
As classification of the responses involved watching videos of moths
flying around either a lit or unlit street light and responding to the
presence or absence of pre-recorded bat calls, it was impossible for
the scorer to be unaware of treatment during analyses. For
consistency the same scorer analysed all moth behavioural video data
in accordance with criteria established by existing peer-reviewed
literature (see lines 140 - 145). However, for clarity we have now
included the following supplementary information (see lines ESM lines
70 - 86):
‘A sub-sample of 20 moth responses were classified blind by an
independent scorer using the same scoring criteria (see main text). 18
responses were classified identically to the original scorer. The two
discrepancies were: 1) a ‘change in flight direction’ response (category
2) reclassified as ‘no change in flight course’ (category 1), and 2) a
‘powerdive’ (category 3) reclassified as ‘behaviour unclear’ (category
4). Statistical analyses were re-run having modified the original
dataset to match with the independent scorer’s classification.
Alterations included substituting discrepancy number 2 (above) as well
as changing at random another behaviour originally marked as a
‘powerdive’ (category 3) to ‘behaviour unclear’ (category 4). Modifying
these two responses is a fair adjustment as only one powerdive out of
10 presented to the independent scorer was misidentified and 21 moth
responses were originally classified as powerdives. As the statistical
analyses compared frequency of powerdives against no powerdives
(pooled category 1 and 2 data) it was not necessary to make changes
following the first of the two discrepancies (category 2 to category 1).
Since statistical significance of our results did not change using the
altered dataset, we have confidence in our results.’
2. Figure 2 a and b are redundant. You only need a.
Completed. Note - figure 2 in the original manuscript is now figure 3
due to the inclusion of an additional figure (now figure 2) which we
have transferred from the electronic supplementary material (ESM).
Reviewer 3:
1. The context of the study could be more adequately established by stating
why you expected LED lights to have a different effect on moth predator
avoidance behaviour to that of more traditional artificial lighting. This should
also be part of the Discussion (lines 164-165).
We have included ‘UV-emitting, broad-spectrum’ (line 51) and ‘UV-
absent, broad-spectrum’ (line 54) to clarify a key difference between
MV and LED street lights in the introduction. This is followed up in the
discussion with the inclusion of ‘despite the absence of UV emissions
in the former’ (lines 181 - 182).
2. Please present the data on the bat activity monitoring with the secondary
detector to provide evidence that categories 1 and 3 were in fact devoid of
bat echolocation. This is important because the experiment was done in the
field and raises the possibility that the results may be an artefact of wild bats
intruding upon the treatments.
Part of our dataset was excluded from analyses as echolocation calls
from nearby wild bats were heard on the secondary bat detector
during treatments. This information was originally found in the
electronic supplementary material (ESM lines 47 - 50), but we have
now included it in the main text – ‘For each model, data from 39 moths
were omitted from analyses because they were either flying > 5 m
from the street light column; flying < 3 m from the ultrasonic speaker;
flying > 5 m from the ultrasonic speaker; or because echolocation calls
from nearby wild bats were heard clearly on the bat detector during
treatments. A further 18 recordings were excluded as these moths’
responses were placed in category 4.’ (See lines 159 - 164).
SPECIFIC COMMENTS
Line 85: For completeness, state whether the species of bats from which
recordings were made are known to feed on eared moths or at least that their
echolocation calls are audible to moths.
We have now included the sentence ‘Both species emit similar calls
with dominant frequencies that are close to the best hearing
frequencies of many moths, and both feed to some extent on
Lepidoptera [18]’ (Lines 91 - 93).
Line 98: The paper by Surlykke A, Kalko EKV (2008) Echolocating Bats Cry
Out Loud to Detect Their Prey. PLoS ONE 3(4): e2036.
doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0002036 would be relevant here.
The paper by Surlykke and Kalko (2008) has now been included as
recommended (line 106, reference 21).
Line 112: Report these data.
This comment has already been addressed (see our response to
Reviewer 3, comment number 2).
Line 118: It is not clear to what "similar" refers to. Rephrase.
Rephrased from ‘Ultrasonic pulses of similar frequency and intensity
emitted…’ to ‘Ultrasonic pulses (produced by an electronic dog whistle
(27 kHz, 110 dB at 1 m) and comparable in frequency and intensity to
those used in our study) emitted…’ (Lines 126 - 128).
Figure 1 is hardly discussed and should be in the context of the expectation
that LED lights would have a different effect on moth avoidance behaviour to
more traditional lighting.
An additional reference to figure 1 has now been made alongside our
hypothesis (line 54) and is in the context recommended following
previous revisions (see our response to Reviewer 3, comment number
1).
Figure 1b presents the same data as figure 1a and can be removed.
Completed (see response to Reviewer 2, comment number 2).
Additional revisions made by the authors:
Amendment to Authors’ Contributions (lines 214 - 217).
Inclusion of ‘and increase the likelihood of predation [16]’ and thus reference
to important recent research by Minnaar et al. 2014 (see lines 52 - 53) that
also suggests a reduction in moth evasive behaviour, although under UV-
emitting MV lights.
Inclusion of an additional figure (figure 2) (see lines 328 - 336) and text
‘Sequences were trimmed to include the final few search phase calls, as well
as the entirety of the approach phase and terminal buzz (figure 2)’ (see lines
96 - 98). Both this figure and the text were originally found in the electronic
supplementary material (ESM). This change has been made for added detail.
A few small grammatical changes have also been made for improved clarity.
We hope that these changes are to your satisfaction, and that the manuscript
is now suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Yours sincerely,
Andrew Wakefield, Emma Stone, Gareth Jones and Stephen Harris

is recognizing the defensive behaviour of the moths, how do you know a
non response was failure to hear (perhaps a deaf moth - could be
something in an individual (like ear mites) or a species lacking ears). Until
the reader knows how you established that the moth(s) heard the
playback, then the question about who heard what, when, remains open.
The vast majority of moths attracted to lights in the UK belong to families
known to possess ultrasonic hearing; >90% of moths caught at artificial
lights in southwest England belong to families with tympanate ears
(Somers-Yeates et al. (2013), Biology Letters 9: 20130376). We tested
moths within five metres of the ultrasonic speaker (see lines 125 – 127)
as peer-reviewed literature (Rydell, Skals, Surlykke, & Svensson, 1997;
Proc R. Soc. Lond. 264B: 83-88) has demonstrated that eared-moths
exposed to ultrasound (comparable in frequency and intensity to that
used in our study) can hear ultrasound at this range of distances. We
have already made reference to this in the text (see lines 127 – 132).
There will of course have been a minority of moths in each treatment
which were not capable of hearing (such as suggested by the reviewer).
However, the proportion of these is extremely unlikely to differ among
treatments, and our experimental design controlled for the potential
presence of deaf moths by comparing relative, rather than absolute, rates
of powerdive activity between lit and unlit conditions. Potential differences
in responses are further accounted for by conducting experiments at four
separate sites within the same season in a randomised design, each with
comparable weather and habitat variables.
For clarity we have included the following material in our discussion:
“While we were unable to identify individual species of moth tested in this
study, the majority of moths tested probably belonged to the families
Noctuidae, Geometridae or Notodontidae. Moths in these families
possess ultrasonic hearing [23] and constitute the vast majority (> 90 %)
of moths attracted to artificial lights in southwest England [6]. Our
experimental design, comparing relative powerdive activity under LED-lit
and unlit treatments in a randomised design, controls for the possibility
that a minority of moths in each treatment were not able to hear the
ultrasonic playbacks.” (See lines 188 – 194).
2. "Macro moth" means what? Do you refer to the Macrolepidoptera? If so,
say so.
We have now avoided use of the term ‘macro-moth’ throughout. There
has been controversy about whether the Macrolepidoptera is a
monophyletic group, and the use of both macro-moth and
Macrolepidoptera can lack taxonomic rigour. We have simply stated that
the vast majority of moths studied were probably noctuids or geometrids,
and that moths in these families possess ultrasonic hearing (see lines 112
– 116).
3. It almost looks as though you need to know what species of moths you
tested. Probably you do not know this for all the moths, but it would help if
you could be specific with some... then you data set would be more
detailed and the results easier to interpret.
Catching individual moths during the experiment was extremely difficult
(see lines 112 - 113). Furthermore, the presence of a designated “moth-
catcher” for each trial may have influenced moth behaviour and was
therefore avoided. The new text that we have provided in response to
point 1 clarifies that almost all moths tested were likely to have been
noctuids and geometrids, and that our experimental design controls for
the presence of any non-hearing moths across treatments.
4. What if you confine your results to the moths that responded (perhaps
you can name some), you can move out of the tangle... This would deal
with the "how do you know the moth heard the bat"
Following our responses to comments 1 – 3 above we believe this is not
necessary: the data for non-responding moths are relative not absolute
and we have controlled for the relative abundance of non-hearing moths
across treatments by our careful experimental design. Moreover we have
provided acoustical data showing that the signals we used should be
audible to tympanate moths at the distances considered.
Our experimental design took full account of the issues raised by this referee,
and we hope that the text we have added clarifies how this is so. We trust
that our comments and our additional changes are sufficiently clear and
render the manuscript suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science.

Manuscript ID RSOS-150291
Dear Dr Padian,
We are pleased that our Manuscript RSOS-150291 entitled "LED
street lights reduce last-ditch evasive manoeuvres by moths to bat
echolocation calls" has been accepted for publication in Royal Society Open
Science subject to minor revision in accordance with the referee suggestions.
We are also pleased that the previous version of our paper was
acceptable to all the referees other than Brock Fenton. We addressed his
comments in the current version of the paper, and we are pleased that the
Editor accepts our rebuttal of his concerns. His current comments are:
“The authors have not allayed my concern about whether or not the
moths they studied could hear bats. Saying that some large percentage of
species of moths in the UK are said to have ears do not mean anything... and
this is without pondering the possibility that some moths with ears also have
infestations of mites perhaps rendering one or both ears dysfunctional or at
least much less sensitive to bat echolocation signals.”
As we have explained in the paper, we are not investigating the
behaviour of individual moths, we are addressing effects on samples of moth
populations. We have explained that many moth populations are declining
and that one contributory factor may be the impact of artificial lighting. LEDs
are being widely introduced as “ecologically friendly” without studies on the
effects on populations of potentially sensitive species such as nocturnal
moths. In this study we have investigated the effects of LED lights on the
evasive strategies used by moths when being hunted by bats. Of course, not
all moths will have heard the bat echolocation calls, for a variety of reasons,
but this is irrelevant: we have compared random samples of moths and
shown a significant negative impact of LED nights on the evasive behaviour
of moths, which is the sole focus of this study. The study design is well
explained and makes it clear why we used this approach. All we can do is
reinforce this yet again, and have done this by making the following changes
to our manuscript:
1) Inclusion of references to moth “populations” because we are looking
at the effect on moth populations (see lines 26 and 207).
2) We have given further explanation as to why moths were tested within
a range of 3-5 metres from the ultrasonic speaker (see lines 126 -
129), further supporting our case that moths were capable of hearing
realistic bat playback intensities.
3) For clarity we have rephrased “Our results show that LED street lights
negatively affect the ability of moths to exhibit powerdives in response
to hunting bats, thereby reducing their ability to evade predation” to
“Our results show that LED street lights negatively affect the
probability that moths will exhibit powerdives in response to hunting
bats, thereby reducing their ability to evade predation” (see lines 179 -
181).
We have made a few other minor grammatical revisions for general
improvement to the manuscript and trust that our changes satisfy the editor.
Yours sincerely,
