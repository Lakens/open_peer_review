The paper is well written and is easy to follow. The authors describe the isolation and
characterization and of cDNA sequences for heat shock protein genes from marbled eel, an
important aquaculture species in Southeast Asia and China. The authors also investigate the roles
of three HSP genes in response to bacterial challenge. The design of the study is straightforward
and the results are clearly presented.
My suggestion is as follows:
1. The authors should include general defense mechanisms against bacterial pathogen and
relate the role of HSPs to immune response at each time point during 72 hour of infection and
compare the HSP levels between liver and muscle tissues.
3
2. The results that these genes were up-regulated in intestine and heart may suggest wider
roles of heat shock proteins other than immune response. The authors should include a few
sentences for this argument from previous work in other vertebrates if any.
3. The authors should suggest potential use of molecular information obtained in this study
and further study on expression of HSP genes to heat stress would be more useful.

Reply: Thanks for your comment. I'm sorry for displaying this part with partial
missing contents. We have revised this part in the section of Materials and Methods
(Line 139-143), as shown in “To examine the evolutionary relationships among the
hsp90 and hsp70 family members in other species, a phylogenetic tree of different
vertebrate hsp genes based on amino acid sequences was constructed by the
neighbor-joining method and bootstrapped for 1000 replicates using MEGA 5
program (http://www.megasoftware.net/megamac.php)”.

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper is well written and is easy to follow. The authors describe the isolation and
characterization and of cDNA sequences for heat shock protein genes from marbled
eel, an important aquaculture species in Southeast Asia and China. The authors also
investigate the roles of three HSP genes in response to bacterial challenge. The design
of the study is straightforward and the results are clearly presented.
My suggestion is as follows:
4. The authors should include general defense mechanisms against bacterial pathogen
and relate the role of HSPs to immune response at each time point during 72 hour of
infection and compare the HSP levels between liver and muscle tissues.
Reply: Thank you for providing the valuable suggestion. We would like to
divide into two parts to answer this question.
(1) We added this content in Discussion section (Line 245-256). Hsps are stress
response proteins as a “dangerous signal” to protect the immune system and the
immune cells involving in the protection of cytoplasm components, including all
kinds of biological factors and biological factors, such as bacterial infection [24]. It
first, mRNA expression of hsps in most organisms reveal an increase in the process of
immune response when pathogens are engulfed by macrophages in order to protect
the organism and maintain life force. Second, heat shock protein is highly conserved
and the immune system can easily identify these highly conservative molecules.
When bacteria invade organism, the organism may release certain cell toxin, and
promote intracellular cytokine synthesis and secretion caused by the variation of
protein or polypeptide chain fragments. These abnormal proteins can be induced by
hsp genes in cells with high expression efficiency [25].
(2) We have added this content in Line 293-301. In liver and muscle tissues, three
Amhsps genes showed different expression patterns, which may be due to liver tissue
as the most important metabolic organ and defense organ with more rapid mRNA
expression of Amhsps with higher intensity in the early phase during 72 hour of
infection. However, muscle tissue is located under the skin. When the fish were
injected with A. hydrophila, it was easy to cause the damage of skin and muscle.
Therefore, the mRNA expression of Amhsp genes increased as the increase of
swimming time, the contact surface of the wound may be enlarged, and the time point
of high expression of Amhsps in muscle tissue may be relatively delayed when
compared with liver tissue.
5. The results that these genes were up-regulated in intestine and heart may suggest
wider roles of heat shock proteins other than immune response. The authors should
include a few sentences for this argument from previous work in other vertebrates if
any.
Reply: Thank you for your opinion. We have added this content in Line 320-334.
Specific as follows: In teleost fish, the reports regarding to heart and intestinal
immune mechanisms associated with hsps are rather few. Our results suggest that
Amhsps plays an important role in the intestine and heart of flower eel. Intestine
digestive tube contains diffused lymphoid tissue, lymphocytes, macrophages and
plasma cells, which are involved in immune defense. When intestinal mucosa was
immune response, then endocrine immune globulin was produced in the digestive
tube to prevent bacterial invasion in the digestive tract, thus regulating the
compositions of the intestinal mucosal immune system [34]. So the infection of
bacteria caused interesting expression patterns. At the same time, hsp is an important
stress protein to protect myocardial cells against myocardial injury, can participate in
the repair and restoration of ion channel redox balance, reduce the release of oxygen
free radicals, and can also be used as the antioxidant for free radicals as the molecular
chaperone to protect cells from damage [35]. Thus, in heart, the expression of Amhsps
is very concentrated and intense.
6. The authors should suggest potential use of molecular information obtained in this
study and further study on expression of HSP genes to heat stress would be more
useful.
Reply: Thank you for your suggestion. We have added this content as follows in
Line 265-268: The Amhsps molecular information will be more useful for further
exploring the expression of hsp genes, such as thermal stress, and the gene sequence
information expands the gene database and provides a theoretical basis for the studies
on other heat shock protein genes in other teleost fish.
