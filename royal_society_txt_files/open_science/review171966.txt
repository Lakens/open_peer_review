The author shows that a proportional integral feedback improves the transient behavior in
comparison with integral feedback. Later the author shows such specific loop exists in different
biological examples. The paper is well written. The mathematical steps is easy, hence the main
contribution of this work is about its application to biology. On that matter the paper needs to be
improved as following:
1- The author did a good job in giving examples from biology that falls in the control scheme that
is introduced. However it is not clear how the mathematical framework is connected to such
examples. Specifically, the connection between the parameters of the examples introduced in Fig.
3 and Fig.4 to the parameters of the model (k_p, k_e, etc.) is not clear. It will be informative to
derive (or mention) how they are connected and what are the crucial parameters out of so many
parameters of the biological examples.
2- The results here are obtained by using a lot of approximations. For each biological example it
will be useful to show that this simple model has similar behavior as in biological examples. It
will be also informative to show when this model fails to capture behavior of biological examples.
I suggest adding 1-2 figures dedicated to clarify this point.
3- Relevant refs that discuss the molecular implementation of integral and proportional
feedbacks are missing.

The paper proposes a motif for proportional integral feedback at the molecular scale. This motif
includes a phosphorolation cycle, wth the output of interest playing a role in de-phosphprolation,
thereby introducing a 'proportional' term to the feedback law. It is then proposed that regulation
of ammonium uptake, copper and zinc homeostasis, and redox regulation in phosphosynthesis
all exhibit this proportional integral feedback motif.
Regarding the proposed motif with x and x*, I have the following comments:
1. Assuming that degradation of x is zeroth order is a big assumption. Dilution due to cell growth
will ensure that a first order clearance term is always present. This first order clearance term will
destroy the integral action. Granted that when this term is small, the steady-state error will also
be small. But this has to be demonstrated for any specific system that is proposed as using PI
feedback. Incidentally, a first order clearance rate for x results in a low pass filter, not an anti-
windup scheme as proposed by the author. Anti-windup schemes have a different role.
2. The feedback as proposed is nonlinear, and so one cannot really describe it as having
'proportional' feedback. It is true that when one linearizes the system around the operating point,
the feedback will be proportional-integral. However, this only applies in the small signal regime.
Thus claiming that the feedback employs PI feedback is only true for small deviations from the
equilibrium, and here again it is up to the author to demonstrate that the biological examples
proposed operate in that regime.
Regarding the biological examples proposed: this is the weakest part of the paper. While the
proposed motif consists of three states: x, x*, and y, the biological examples have a lot more
species and thus have models which are much larger than 3. No attempt is made to show how a
motif that is based on three states should apply to systems with much higher order. Nor are the
assumptions of a) zero order clearance of x, and b) small signal regime verified for the biological
examples proposed.
Based on the above, it is my opinion that this work is pre-mature, and much work needs to be
done to support the claims made. Regrettably, I recommend rejection of the manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
This paper presents a controller motif displaying behavior similar to a PI-controller. My review is
based on a resubmitted version as I didn’t review the original paper. It is an interesting paper
where different biological examples are used to motivate for the existence of such an overall
control structure. My specific/general comments are as follows:
1
Why is the derivation of Eq (2.4) based on synthesis of inactive protein while all the biological
examples use synthesis of active protein? For pedagogical reasons, I would have moved the
derivation shown in appendix A1 to the main manuscript (which is related to biological
examples), and rather move the not-used Eq. (2.4) to the appendix.
2
Regarding the resemblance with a PI-controller: As an industrial process would actually function
with only the P-part (even though the control error e>0), the proposed controller motif in this
paper would not function with the P-part alone. That is, if the gene regulation is removed, there
is no control of the level of y, and the underlying fundamental control structure is not a P-
controller. This is to some degree commented in line 182, but it is not explicitly stated that the
system is no longer regulated. This should be elaborated/commented, as we often seek to
compare biological regulations with well-known man-made industrial control structures, and we
can be misled to assume that your motif would function solely on the P-part alone. Furthermore,
as you to some degree indicate in line 162, I think the underlying structure of your system share
more similarities with feed forward loops.
3
Regarding the simulation results: I have simulated the entire three-dimensional nonlinear system,
7
and I think that your take-home message (being that the assumption of rapid equilibrium
between x and x^* produces P(I)-like behavior) would be clarified if you include the responses of
x and x^*. The rapid (almost immediate) change in x^* (and also x) is quite distinct when
k_a=k_i=100, which is of course similar to the direct P-part. Thus, if you also include another
simulation using e.g. k_a=k_i=1, the overall homeostatic behavior is not changed, but the
observed direct action in x^* is not present anymore. Hence, the observed P-part look-alike
behavior is highly dependent on the relation between certain rate constant values, and even
though this is explained in the manuscript, I think this is an important point to emphasize using
simulations.
4
Regarding the forgetting factor and comparison with anti-windup in A2. I think this comparison
is a bit far-fetched. If the controller molecule is degraded by first order, the integrator in the
controller (I-part) is replace by a first order system. Thus, the homeostatic properties are lost and
y_ref in appendix A2 actually becomes a time dependent variable y_ref(t), where the level of
y_ref will depend on the level of the disturbance, i.e. the level of s. This situation share
similarities to the structure shown in Figure 8 in the work by He, Fromion and Westerhoff (2013)
“(Im)Perfect robustness and adaptation of metabolic networks subject to metabolic and gene-
expression regulation: marrying control engineering with metabolic control analysis“. The first
order degradation can also be compared to a situation where the degradation is modelled as a
non-saturated Michaelis-Menten degradation. This will lead to what Ma et. al (2009) (already
cited) termed precision/sensitivity or to what Drengstig et. al (2012), “A basic set of homeostatic
controller motifs” termed controller accuracy. Thus, the relation to these concepts and other
similar work should be discussed. The benefit of using a Michaelis-Menten model in the
degradation is that this structure, under certain conditions, is also a plausible model for zero
order degradation.
Specific comments:
1
Why is s shown as time dependent in Fig 1, while all other variables are not?
2
The value of y_ref=0.3 in Fig 2 should have been indicated/drawn and also shown how to be
calculated from the differential equation of total protein X, i.e.
y_ref = (v_f/k_d-1)*theta_f = (0.1/0.05-1)*0.3=0.3
Thus, an important condition is that k_d<v_f.
3
Since Fig 3c is a well known industrial version of the structures in Fig3a/b, you should perhaps
use another integration variable (s in Fig 3c should not be confused with the substrate s in Fig
3a/b)
4
Regarding Fig 3, I think that the abstract version should be presented below the detailed version.
5
What are the initial conditions for the simulation in Fig 2?
6
What is the motivation behind the third order Hill kinetic in the example?
7
Regarding the statement that “transient performance of the integral controller has been
8
overlooked“ (line 176): There are several contributions focusing on dynamic behavior of integral
control, e.g. Thorsen et. al (2016) “Tuning of Physiological Controller Motifs” and Ang et. al
(2013) (already cited).
8
I think a sketch similar to Fig 1B indicating the rate constants used in the model example in
chapter 4 would be useful.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
The author has described a biochemical PI control structure involving transcription/post-
translation, and provided a number of biochemical examples that are consistent with the
structure. The reviewer has some comments/queries:
- The novelty of the control structure beyond that described in [*] is not stated. In that reference,
the P component was carried out by allosteric regulation while the I component was via
transcription, but the relevance of the analysis to transcription/post-translation modification was
discussed. Similarly, Ref [8] also studied an example of a PI controller involving
transcription/post-translation.
- The reviewer finds the proposed name of the control structure confusing. For example, a PI
controller with transcription and allosteric regulation could also equally be called a level-activity
PI controller.
- The assumption of zeroth order degradation is a known issue in integral controllers (as
discussed in the references). For the general case, a standard approach is to describe the controller
as a lag controller and calculate the steady state error.
- In the first example, the author should expand the explanation of the benefit of additional
analysis beyond that of [17].
- The claim made regarding the 2nd and 3rd examples is unclear. Is the author claiming that these
examples have perfect adaptation, or illustrating the previously unknown mechanism/structure
9
causing perfect adaptation? In either case, it would be useful to expand analysis/discussion for
these examples.
Minor comment:
- "widely used in industry" in the introduction unclear in a biological context. "Widely used in
industrial automation" or similar would be clearer.

expression regulation: marrying control engineering with metabolic control analysis, He et al,

ould like to thank the reviewers for their comments on my manuscript. I have considered the
gestions made by the two Reviewers, and I am convinced that the new additions have greatly
roved the quality of the manuscript. Below I respond to the reviewer comments in detail and I
icate which changes have been made to the manuscript (major changes in red in the delta
sion). Note that there are some overlaps between the questions of the two reviewers, so that there
some redundancies in my answers.

author shows that a proportional integral feedback improves the transient behavior in
parison with integral feedback. Later the author shows such specific loop exists in different
logical examples. The paper is well written. The mathematical steps is easy, hence the main
tribution of this work is about its application to biology. On that matter the paper needs to be
roved as following:
The author did a good job in giving examples from biology that falls in the control scheme that is
oduced. However it is not clear how the mathematical framework is connected to such
mples. Specifically, the connection between the parameters of the examples introduced in Fig. 3
Fig.4 to the parameters of the model (k_p, k_e, etc.) is not clear. It will be informative to derive
mention) how they are connected and what are the crucial parameters out of so many parameters
he biological examples.
structure of the biomolecular feedback for all the examples is the same as for the biochemical
hway, with only one slight variation: the protein X is produced in its active form. Thus, very
ilar models can be used, and the same theoretical development can be followed, leading to the
e relation between the kinetics parameters (of production, degradation, activation, and
ctivation) and the controller parameter given by Eq. (2.4). This is now detailled in Appendix A1.
ditionally, I have now added in the scheme of each example (Fig. 3 and 4) what the x, x*, and y
iables are, so that it becomes easier to connect the biological example to the mathematical
mework.
ally, in the previous version, the AmtB example in Fig.3 was presented in details (with all the
naling system), which was a bit confusing. In the new version, a more abstract scheme is added,
hat model derivation becomes easier. Given that all the signaling dynamics is fast in comparison
h the dynamics of the transporter concentration, the mathematical model of this more abstract
resentation can be obtained by a slow-fast approximation of the whole system.
The results here are obtained by using a lot of approximations. For each biological example it
l be useful to show that this simple model has similar behavior as in biological examples. It will
also informative to show when this model fails to capture behavior of biological examples. I
gest adding 1-2 figures dedicated to clarify this point.
stated in my previous answer, I have now shown in appendix how to derive the dynamics of the
ve protein for all the examples, given that it is rather general. To do so, the first hypothesis is the
oth order degradation, as it is assumed for integral loop in biological systems (this assumption is
discussed in Section 3). Two additional hypotheses are then necessary to get a LA-PI feedback
. (2.4)): the time scale separation and the linear approximation. To test the validity of these
otheses in the biochemical pathway example, I have now added simulations of regulations with
assical I and PI controller, in comparison with the original system (i.e. before linearization and
slow-fast approximation). We obtain very similar behaviors, showing that these hypotheses are
id in this case. This point has been added in the subsection Numerical simulations and is further
cussed in Section 3.
the other examples, I do not find enough experimental data to calibrate the mathematical model
to test the validity of my development. This paper remains thus theoretical, and an experimental
idation should deserve future work (actually, even the integral loop – although often mentioned -
never been fully investigated experimentally).

paper proposes a motif for proportional integral feedback at the molecular scale. This motif
ludes a phosphorolation cycle, wth the output of interest playing a role in de-phosphprolation,
reby introducing a 'proportional' term to the feedback law. It is then proposed that regulation of
monium uptake, copper and zinc homeostasis, and redox regulation in phosphosynthesis all
ibit this proportional integral feedback motif.
arding the proposed motif with x and x*, I have the following comments:
Assuming that degradation of x is zeroth order is a big assumption. Dilution due to cell growth
l ensure that a first order clearance term is always present. This first order clearance term will
troy the integral action. Granted that when this term is small, the steady-state error will also be
all. But this has to be demonstrated for any specific system that is proposed as using PI feedback.
identally, a first order clearance rate for x results in a low pass filter, not an anti-windup scheme
roposed by the author. Anti-windup schemes have a different role.
ree that the zeroth order hypothesis is a big assumption. It has been widely considered - perhaps
groundless way – in the papers dealing with integral control in biological systems. Dilution due
ell growth concerns fast-growing cells, such as bacteria. On the other hand, growth is negligible
ome systems, such as transporter of mammalian cells (as presented in Section 2). In any case,
zeroth order hypothesis is always considered, but has never been verified experimentally (to my
wledge). Experimental measurements of degradation kinetics in any biological system involving
entially a (P)I feedback would be of great interest, but it is behind the scope of this paper. This
nt is now discussed in Section 3.
ncerning the effect of a first order clearance term due to growth, I agree that it corresponds in
uency analysis to a low-pass filter with a cute-off frequency equals to the specific growth rate µ.
error signal with a frequency higher than µ, the system acts actually as an integrator. For lower
uency, it acts as a passband, but error signals with a frequency lower than µ are not relevant in
st of the cases: the controller is expected to actuate on a time scale faster than growth. That is
y, in my opinion, the frequency analysis is not suited to the present case.
anti-windup is a scheme that avoids a windup of the integral term when the actuator saturates. In
case, if an error persists, the integral term will saturate because of the first order clearance rate.
s can be viewed as a kind of anti-windup scheme, although the saturation of the integral term
l act even if the actuator is not saturated (so I agree that this is not sticto sensu an anti-windup
eme). This has been specified in Appendix A2.
The feedback as proposed is nonlinear, and so one cannot really describe it as having
portional' feedback. It is true that when one linearizes the system around the operating point, the
dback will be proportional-integral. However, this only applies in the small signal regime. Thus
ming that the feedback employs PI feedback is only true for small deviations from the
ilibrium, and here again it is up to the author to demonstrate that the biological examples
posed operate in that regime.
earizion simplifies the mathematical development. Without these approximations, we obtain a
d of generalized PI controller. Instead of being the sum of a Proportional and an Integral terms,
correction will be the sum of a function of the error and an integral of a function of the error,
netheless, the same characteristics as the classical PI controller will be obtained: a fast imprecise
ponse (equivalent to a Proportional action) coupled with a slower one which eliminates the offset
uivalent to an Integral action). This point is now better discussed in Section 3.
ally, we now show on Fig. 2 that the behaviors of the system and its linear approximation are
y similar, i.e. the LA-PI controller acts as a classical PI controller.
arding the biological examples proposed: this is the weakest part of the paper. While the
posed motif consists of three states: x, x*, and y, the biological examples have a lot more species
thus have models which are much larger than 3. No attempt is made to show how a motif that is
ed on three states should apply to systems with much higher order. Nor are the assumptions of a)
o order clearance of x, and b) small signal regime verified for the biological examples proposed.
key aspect is that the proposed motif has been identified in all the biological examples. This is
clearly stated in the introduction of the subsection Biological examples.
e mathematical model is necessary to understand the behavior of the motif. Once it has been
e for one case, the motif can be identified in other biological systems, without needing a
thematical model.
the other hand, the model can be useful to better apprehend the system. So I now explain in
endix A1 how we can derive a model for all the examples. Note that we consider only the
molecular feedback loop, which fits in all the examples to the proposed motif. We do not have to
del the whole system, which limits the number of variables.
the AmtB system, I represent in details the signaling mechanisms. Nonetheless, given the time-
le separation (all these reactions are faster than gene expression), we can use quasi steady-state
roximation (as it is done for protein activation). Thus, on the slow time scale, all these signaling
chanisms only determines the functions f(y) and ki(y). A more precise mathematical model is not
essary in this case, as it will be reduced by time scale separation. To avoid any confusion, the
tB system is now represented in a more abstract way (Fig. 3A), so that it fits clearly to the
del development. All these points are now explained in Appendix A1.
ed on the above, it is my opinion that this work is pre-mature, and much work needs to be done
upport the claims made. Regrettably, I recommend rejection of the manuscript.

Response to Reviewers of ”A biomolecular proportional
tegral controller based on feedback regulations of protein
level and activity”
Francis Mairet
ould like to thank the reviewers for their comments on my manuscript. I have considered the
gestions made by the two reviewers to improve the quality of the article. Below I respond to the
iewer comments in detail and I indicate which changes have been made to the manuscript (major
nges in red in the delta version).

s paper presents a controller motif displaying behavior similar to a PI-controller. My review is
ed on a resubmitted version as I didn’t review the original paper. It is an interesting paper where
erent biological examples are used to motivate for the existence of such an overall control
cture. My specific/general comments are as follows:
Why is the derivation of Eq (2.4) based on synthesis of inactive protein while all the biological
mples use synthesis of active protein? For pedagogical reasons, I would have moved the
ivation shown in appendix A1 to the main manuscript (which is related to biological examples),
rather move the not-used Eq. (2.4) to the appendix.
sake of clarity, the motif is introduced first with the theoretical example (the biochemical
hway), before the biological examples. In the case of the biochemical pathway, enzymes are in
eral produced and then activated (rather than produced in active form and inactivated if
essary). That is why this presentation seems to me to be the most appropriate.
Regarding the resemblance with a PI-controller: As an industrial process would actually function
h only the P-part (even though the control error e>0), the proposed controller motif in this paper
uld not function with the P-part alone. That is, if the gene regulation is removed, there is no
trol of the level of y, and the underlying fundamental control structure is not a P-controller. This
o some degree commented in line 182, but it is not explicitly stated that the system is no longer
ulated. This should be elaborated/commented, as we often seek to compare biological
ulations with well-known man-made industrial control structures, and we can be misled to
ume that your motif would function solely on the P-part alone. Furthermore, as you to some
ree indicate in line 162, I think the underlying structure of your system share more similarities
h feed forward loops.
ystem with just activity regulation (i.e. without gene regulation) is possible. Following the same
elopment with X(t)=X_ref instead of Eq. (2 .1), we can show that it acts actually as a P
troller, as mentioned in the discussion.
d-Forward loops in biology deals in general with two transcription factors modulating a target
e (the so-called FFL motif). The LAPI structure shows similarities with a FFL, but I do not
elop further this point to avoid confusion with the FFL motif.
egarding the simulation results: I have simulated the entire three-dimensional nonlinear system,
I think that your take-home message (being that the assumption of rapid equilibrium between x
x^* produces P(I)-like behavior) would be clarified if you include the responses of x and x^*.
rapid (almost immediate) change in x^* (and also x) is quite distinct when k_a=k_i=100, which
f course similar to the direct P-part. Thus, if you also include another simulation using e.g.
=k_i=1, the overall homeostatic behavior is not changed, but the observed direct action in x^* is
present anymore. Hence, the observed P-part look-alike behavior is highly dependent on the
tion between certain rate constant values, and even though this is explained in the manuscript, I
k this is an important point to emphasize using simulations.
dynamics of x and x* have been added on Figure 2 for both the I and LA-PI systems, which
ws to better understand the effect of the P-part. Note that parameter values have been slightly
dified for sake of figure clarity.
Regarding the forgetting factor and comparison with anti-windup in A2. I think this comparison
a bit far-fetched. If the controller molecule is degraded by first order, the integrator in the
troller (I-part) is replace by a first order system. Thus, the homeostatic properties are lost and
ef in appendix A2 actually becomes a time dependent variable y_ref(t), where the level of y_ref
l depend on the level of the disturbance, i.e. the level of s. This situation share similarities to the
cture shown in Figure 8 in the work by He, Fromion and Westerhoff (2013) “(Im)Perfect
ustness and adaptation of metabolic networks subject to metabolic and gene-expression
ulation: marrying control engineering with metabolic control analysis“. The first order
radation can also be compared to a situation where the degradation is modelled as a non-
rated Michaelis-Menten degradation. This will lead to what Ma et. al (2009) (already cited)
med precision/sensitivity or to what Drengstig et. al (2012), “A basic set of homeostatic
troller motifs” termed controller accuracy. Thus, the relation to these concepts and other similar
rk should be discussed. The benefit of using a Michaelis-Menten model in the degradation is that
structure, under certain conditions, is also a plausible model for zero order degradation.
first order degradation prevents the integral term from increasing too much, that is why I
pare it with an anti-windup. To avoid misinterpretation, this comparison is no longer
ntioned. I have slightly modified the discussion on this point, but I did not develop much more
aspect given that it is not specific to the LA-PI controller and it has already been tackled in
eral articles.
cific comments:
Why is s shown as time dependent in Fig 1, while all other variables are not?

The value of y_ref=0.3 in Fig 2 should have been indicated/drawn and also shown how to be

What are the initial conditions for the simulation in Fig 2?

What is the motivation behind the third order Hill kinetic in the example?
h function is classically used to represent gene regulation (see e.g. Alon U. An introduction to
tems biology: design principles of biological circuits, 2006).
Regarding the statement that “transient performance of the integral controller has been

author has described a biochemical PI control structure involving transcription/post-translation,
provided a number of biochemical examples that are consistent with the structure. The reviewer
some comments/queries:
he novelty of the control structure beyond that described in [*] is not stated. In that reference, the
omponent was carried out by allosteric regulation while the I component was via transcription,
the relevance of the analysis to transcription/post-translation modification was discussed.
ilarly, Ref [8] also studied an example of a PI controller involving transcription/post-translation.
*], the authors consider systems with both regulations, but not necessarily on the same enzyme
Eq. 14, X and E are vectors). In my case, I show that a given enzyme can act as a PI effector.
differences between our approach are visible in the biological examples they proposed. In the
t one, the level of the enzyme is regulated, but not its activity. The proportional action is
diated by changes in substrate concentration. The second example (Fig. 14), the gene-expression
ulation and the metabolic regulation deals with different enzymes. None of these examples
responds to the scheme I have proposed. This point is now better discussed in Section 3.
8], the authors focused only on the integral action.
he reviewer finds the proposed name of the control structure confusing. For example, a PI
troller with transcription and allosteric regulation could also equally be called a level-activity PI
troller.
s possibility (a PI controller with transcription and allosteric regulation) was considered (as
cussed in the third paragraph of Section 3), so that in my opinion the name is adequate.
he assumption of zeroth order degradation is a known issue in integral controllers (as discussed
he references). For the general case, a standard approach is to describe the controller as a lag
troller and calculate the steady state error.
ve some references on this point in the discussion, but I did not develop it much more given that,
he reviewer mentioned, it is not specific to the LA-PI controller.
the first example, the author should expand the explanation of the benefit of additional analysis
ond that of [17].
[17], the authors have focused only on the regulation of transporter activity. In my article, I
lain that it is coupled with the regulation of transporter production. This difference is now better
lained.
he claim made regarding the 2nd and 3rd examples is unclear. Is the author claiming that these
mples have perfect adaptation, or illustrating the previously unknown mechanism/structure
sing perfect adaptation? In either case, it would be useful to expand analysis/discussion for these
mples.
the examples share the same motif, i.e. the coupling of two regulations concerning the same
lecular actuator, acting slowly on its abundance and fast on its activity. This guarantees some
ulation performances, as stated in the discussion. Perfect adaptation will be obtained only if the
radation kinetics is of zeroth order. This assumption has not been verified experimentally, so that
se systems do not present necessarily perfect adaptation. This point is now clearly stated in the
cussion.

widely used in industry" in the introduction unclear in a biological context. "Widely used in
ustrial automation" or similar would be clearer.
