The study describes a routine genome-wide analysis of gene family in sequenced genomes.
Authors have chosen to analyze fructokinases (FRKs) in four Rosaceae genomes. Using in silico
approaches, identification of gene family members, analysis of gene structure, phylogeny and
microsynteny were performed. In addition, the authors have validated a few genes by qRT-PCR.
The manuscript would be of general interest; however, the following points must be addressed:
1. Abstract
a. Lines 21-23 talk about duplication, followed by a sentence on qRT-PCR. Then a couple of lines
on duplication (L25-26). Again, a line of description on qRT-PCR (L27). Authors should
categorically summarize their findings, and there should not be any such oscillations.
b. L29: the statement ‘further characterization and biological functions in pear’ is unclear.
Authors should pinpoint interesting candidate(s) which could be suitable for functional
characterization, and add a line on the immediate future perspective of the study.
c. Grammar and typos need to be taken care.
2. Introduction
a. The English language needs polishing.
b. Authors should add a note on the importance of such integrated analysis in resolving basic
questions about divergent gene family members.
c. A note on the importance of pear, peach, mei, and strawberry will add to the merit of this
study. Statistical data could also be presented (productivity, export, etc.).
3. Results
a. Authors shall remove the repetitive sentences from materials and methods. Authors should
focus describing what they have got and not on what they did to get the result.
b. In case of multi-gene families, or domains present in several gene families, false proteins may
be identified based on the presence of domain. Authors should specify what criteria they have
considered while searching the FRK proteins and how they had made sure they are pulling the
right protein?
c. Of the identified genes, how many are pseudogenes? Discuss.
d. How many genes possessed alternate transcripts? Increasing evidence indicates that alternate
transcripts have an equally important role in regulatory processes and this data should not be
ignored. The data shall be produced in Table 1.
e. Irrespective of the genes belonging to the same family, there is a remarkable difference among
the members in terms of lengths of gene/protein, molecular weight and pI. Authors should
discuss this.
f. Authors should study the cis-regulatory elements in the promoter region of each gene (~2kb
upstream).
g. Selection of candidate genes for transcriptional profiling needs to be explained.
h. Expression profiles need to be discussed in terms of fold-change.

4. Discussion
a. There is no rigorous discussion of the results in light of published literature. This should be
taken care.
b. Authors should study the cis-regulatory elements in promoter region of each gene (~2kb
upstream) and correlate the cis-elements with the expression profile of each gene.
5. Methods
a. Scope exists to improve the scientific language.
b. As mentioned above, authors should study the cis-regulatory elements in the promoter region

This article focuses on the fructose kinases (FRKs), which are important regulators of fructose
metabolism. The published model plant Arabidopsis thaliana FRK protein family sequence was
selected as the source sequence in four Rosaceae plants (peach, plum, strawberry, pear). Full-
genome data were used to identify the fructokinase gene family and a total of 49 fructokinase
genes were obtained. These 49 fructokinase genes were performed: Chromosomal localization,
evolutionary analysis, gene structure analysis, microcollinearity analysis, and base substitution
4
rate Calculate (Ka/Ks). Finally, the 20 Chinese white pear fructokinase genes identified in the
article were used as target genes for expression analysis in four different Chinese white pear
tissues (roots, stems, leaves, flowers).
Throughout the article, the experimental design was reasonable, the results of the study were
credible, and four types of fructose metabolism-regulated genes (FRKs) in the Rosaceae plant
were systematically elucidated. The expression characteristics of the FKs gene in Chinese white
pear were studied in depth, providing candidates for further functional analysis. Target gene.
The article has a high theoretical value and it is recommended to accept after minor revisions:
1. It is recommended to refer to the published results of qRT-PCR expression analysis of other
plant FRKs genes, from the perspective of comparing fructose content differences between plants,
in the discussion section on "Article Figure 5. China White Pear FRKs Gene in 4 Different Tissues
( The results of qRT-PCR expression analysis of roots, stems, leaves and flowers were discussed
in depth.
2. It is recommended to use VGSC(http://bio.njfu.edu.cn/vgsc2) to re-draw the collinearity
analysis graph of Figure 4 to improve the expressiveness of the graph.
3. The manuscript will need to be carefully re-read and the grammar corrected (ideally by a
native speaker).
I would recommend to reconsider publication once these points will be clarified / fixed.

approaches, identification of gene family members, analysis of gene structure, phylogeny and
microsynteny were performed. In addition, the authors have validated a few genes by qRT-PCR.
The manuscript would be of general interest; however, the following points must be addressed:
1. Abstract
a. Lines 21-23 talk about duplication, followed by a sentence on qRT-PCR. Then a couple of
lines on duplication (L25-26). Again, a line of description on qRT-PCR (L27). Authors should
categorically summarize their findings, and there should not be any such oscillations.
Reply: Thank you for your valuable comment and suggestion. We have removed the overlapping
contents and summarized our results, described on the Page 1 of the “Absrtact”. As follows:
Phylogenetic and exon-intron analysis classified these FRKss into ten subfamilies, and further to
reveal the variation of the gene structure and the evolutionary relationship of this gene family.
Remarkably, gene expression patterns in different tissues or different development stages of pear
fruit suggested functional redundancy for PbFRKs derived from segmental duplication or
genome-wide duplication and subfunctionalization for some of them. Additionally, PbFRK11,
PbFRK13 and PbFRK16 were found to play important roles to regulating the sugar content in fruit.
(lines: 20-29)
b. L29: the statement ‘further characterization and biological functions in pear’ is unclear.
Authors should pinpoint interesting candidate(s) which could be suitable for functional
characterization, and add a line on the immediate future perspective of the study.
Reply: This is a very good suggestion. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have gave
pinpoint interesting candidates, including PbFRK11, PbFRK13 and PbFRK16, which might play
important roles for regulate the sugar content in fruit. (lines: 25-27)
c. Grammar and typos need to be taken care.
Reply: Many thanks for this comment. Grammar and typos have been revised by a professional
American Journal Expert and a native English speaker.
2. Introduction
a. The English language needs polishing.
Reply: Many thanks for this comment. Our paper has been polished by a professional American
Journal Expert and a native English speaker.
b. Authors should add a note on the importance of such integrated analysis in resolving basic
questions about divergent gene family members.
Reply: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have modified this in the paper accordingly. As
follows: The current study provides valuable information about FRK members, and highlights the
potential candidates for further functional analysis of this important gene family, which may
regulate sugar content in fruits. (lines: 75-78)
c. A note on the importance of pear, peach, mei, and strawberry will add to the merit of this
study. Statistical data could also be presented (productivity, export, etc.).
Reply: This is a very good suggestion. In the present study, we have added the merit of this study,
such as statistical data. As follows: The pear, peach, mei, and strawberry, belong to Rosaceae
family, have important economic value (Cai et al., 2010; Farinati et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2013). Due
to its economic prominence, peach (Verde et al., 2013), mei (Zhang et al., 2012), strawberry
(Shulaev et al., 2011) and pear genome (Wu et al., 2013), as well as the proteome and
transcriptome of pear fruit development were sequenced. Among the main fruit variety of China's
foreign exports, the Chinese pear produces more than 60% of the world pear production. Sugar
content is an important factor affecting the taste and quality of fruit (Beckles, 2012). (lines: 64-69)
3. Results
a. Authors shall remove the repetitive sentences from materials and methods. Authors should
focus describing what they have got and not on what they did to get the result.
Reply: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have removed the repetitive sentences from
results. Then we simplify this part and focus on describing our research results.
b. In case of multi-gene families, or domains present in several gene families, false proteins
may be identified based on the presence of domain. Authors should specify what criteria they have
considered while searching the FRK proteins and how they had made sure they are pulling the
right protein?
Reply: The reviewer raised a good and professional suggestion. In the present study, two
strategies were implemented to identify the correct FRK genes. Firstly, we obtain the seed of
fructokinase domain PF00294 and Arabidopsis thaliana FRK proteins from Pfam database
(http://pfam.xfam.org/) and TAIR database (http://www.arabidopsis.org/). Subsequently, we
used HMMER software and BlastP to identified FRK proteins in four Rosaceae genomes.
Finally, all the FRK proteins were for the presence of fructokinase domain PF00294 by
SMART (Letunic et al., 2012), Pfam (Punta et al., 2011) and HMMER website
(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/hmmer/search/hmmscan). Not containing the complete
FRK-domain proteins were removed in our study. (lines: 84-86 and lines: 340-343)
c. Of the identified genes, how many are pseudogenes? Discuss.
Reply: Many thanks for this comment. We verified the 49 non-redundant FRK genes using pfam
(http://pfam.xfam.org/) and SMART (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/). The result indicated that
their domains were intact. In addition, we used Gene Ontology, comparative genomics, and
qRT-PCR to predict the functions of the FRK genes.
d. How many genes possessed alternate transcripts? Increasing evidence indicates that alternate
transcripts have an equally important role in regulatory processes and this data should not be
ignored. The data shall be produced in Table 1.
Reply: The reviewer raised a good and professional suggestion. As a common mechanism,
alternative splicing could produce different subtypes of proteins, which could likely affect the
diversities of proteomic and transcriptomics, and finally affecting the regulation of protein
function and gene expression (Black, 2003; Pan et al., 2008). In the present study, we did not
identify that the FRK genes have undergone alternate transcripts events based on the annotation
information of these genomes.
e. Irrespective of the genes belonging to the same family, there is a remarkable difference
among the members in terms of lengths of gene/protein, molecular weight and pI. Authors should
discuss this.
Reply: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have discussed the remarkable difference
among the members in terms of lengths of gene/protein, molecular weight and pI. As follows: The
significant difference was observed in their amino acid sequence length between the members. .
These results might be due to the different length of the N-terminal sequence (with unknown
function) or different numbers of additional insertions. As previously reported, FRKs active in
plants are between 319 amino acids (Solanum tuberosum FRK, which genbank accession number
is CAA78283) and 389 amino acids long (Solanum lycopersicum FRK3, which genbank accession
number is NP_001234396 and includes a chloroplast transit peptide), whereas SlFRK2 (Genbank
accession number: XP_004239035) is >600 amino acids long (Chen et al., 2017; Stein and Granot,
2018). The common characteristics might to be shared by these proteins and active FRKs, while
the additional N-terminal sequences and insertions may generate loops that might interfere with
fructose binding, which has been reported by Riggs and Callis et al (2017) (Riggs and Callis,
2017). We also found that the theoretical pI values of most FRK proteins were less than 7,
indicating that they were acidic, whereas four proteins by the other FRK genes (PbFRK03,
PbFRK20, PmFRK04 and PmFRK06) were alkaline (>7). (lines: 102-115)
f. Authors should study the cis-regulatory elements in the promoter region of each gene (~2kb
upstream).
Reply: We believe that the reviewer’s suggestions are reasonable, and we have carried out the
cis-regulatory elements analysis of all FRK genes. As follows: Cis-acting elements play key roles
in plant growth and development, such as determining the tissue-specific or stress responsive
expression patterns of genes. In our study, we identified the three category cis-acting elements,
including plant growth and development, phytohormone responses and biotic and abiotic stress
responses (Table S5). In the promoter regions, numerous cis-acting elements were widespread,
such as Skn-1-motif and GCN4_motif for endosperm expression, Box 4 and MRE for light
responsiveness, and CAT-box and CCGTCC-box for meristem expression. Remarkably, there was
the higher amount of cis-acting elements for plant growth and development, contrasting with the
cis-acting elements of phytohormone responses and biotic and abiotic stress responses. These
findings suggest that numbers of the FRK gene family may have a special role in plant growth and
development. (lines: 202-212)
g. Selection of candidate genes for transcriptional profiling needs to be explained.
Reply: Many thanks for this comment. In the present study, among the main fruit variety of
China's foreign exports, the Chinese pear produces more than 60% of the world pear production,
so all pear FRK genes were selected for qRT-PCR to further insight into the functional during fruit
development or different tissues. Finally, PbFRK11, PbFRK13 and PbFRK16 were found to play
important roles for regulate the sugar content in fruit.
h. Expression profiles need to be discussed in terms of fold-change.
Reply: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have used fold-change to discuss expression
profiling. As follows: To further characterize the pear FRK gene functions, we performed
comparative gene expression analyses during different developmental stages of fruits and three
different tissues (root, stem and leaf) by qRT-PCR experiments. In present study, we found that
some PbFRK genes were highly expressed in specific tissues or fruit development stages. For
example, the expressions of nine genes (PbFRK01, PbFRK02, PbFRK03, PbFRK04, PbFRK06,
PbFRK08, PbFRK09, PbFRK10 and PbFRK19 were highly expressed in roots; PbFRK01,
PbFRK03, PbFRK04, PbFRK06 and PbFRK08 were up-regulated by more than 2.5-fold and
PbFRK01 showed the greatest up-regulation (by more than 5-fold), PbFRK07, PbFRK12,
PbFRK13, PbFRK15, PbFRK17 and PbFRK20 had high expression in leaves; PbFRK12,
PbFRK15 and PbFRK17 were strongly up-regulated (by more than 2.8-folds, 2.9-folds and
2.0-folds), while PbFRK05, PbFRK14 and PbFRK18 peaked in stems; PbFRK18 were highly
expressed by more than 9.8-folds. These results indicated that different PbFRK genes may play
key roles in the development of specific tissues (Figure 5). Remarkably, PbFRK11, PbFRK13 and
PbFRK16 were detected as down–regulated during pear fruit development (Figure S2). These
results showed a negative correlation with fructose levels, implying that these genes may play
important roles for fructose efflux and regulate the sugar content in fruit. Moreover, some PbFRK
genes were highly expressed at 133 days after flowering (DAF) than at other genes, such as
PbFRK03 and PbFRK04 were up-regulated by more than 14-folds and PbFRK20 presented
strongly up-regulation by more than 2000-folds, signifying that these genes may contribute to the
maturation of fruit development (Figure S2). (lines: 215-235)
4. Discussion
a. There is no rigorous discussion of the results in light of published literature. This should be
taken care.
Reply: We sincerely thankful for the careful review from the reviewer. Following the reviewer’s
suggestion, we have been rigorous discussion of the results in light of published literature. (lines:
277-297 and lines: 304-315)
b. Authors should study the cis-regulatory elements in promoter region of each gene (~2kb
upstream) and correlate the cis-elements with the expression profile of each gene.
Reply: This is a very good suggestion. We have studied cis-regulatory elements in promoter
region of each gene (~2kb upstream) and correlate the cis-elements with the expression profile of
FRK genes. (lines: 277-297 and lines: 304-315)
5. Methods
a. Scope exists to improve the scientific language.
Reply: Many thanks for this comment. Our paper has been polished by a professional American
Journal Expert and a native English speaker.
b. As mentioned above, authors should study the cis-regulatory elements in the promoter region
of each gene (~2kb upstream).
Reply: Many thanks for this comment. The cis-regulatory elements analysis was carried out in the
promoter region of each FRK gene (~2kb upstream). As follows: to analyze the cis-acting
elements, the 2000 bp of genomic DNA sequence upstream of the initiation code (ATG) of FRK
genes were obtained from the pear, mei, peach and strawberry genome, respectively. The presence
of different cis-acting element was determined by using the PlantCARE website
(http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/) (Lescot et al., 2002). (lines:
362-366)
c. Gene ontology annotation using annotation tools (like Blast2GO) will be informative.
Reply: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have carried out Gene ontology annotation
analysis by using Blast2GO software according to previous studies (Muthamilarasan et al., 2015).

This article focuses on the fructose kinases (FRKs), which are important regulators of fructose
metabolism. The published model plant Arabidopsis thaliana FRK protein family sequence was
selected as the source sequence in four Rosaceae plants (peach, plum, strawberry, pear).
Full-genome data were used to identify the fructokinase gene family and a total of 49 fructokinase
genes were obtained. These 49 fructokinase genes were performed: Chromosomal localization,
evolutionary analysis, gene structure analysis, microcollinearity analysis, and base substitution
rate Calculate (Ka/Ks). Finally, the 20 Chinese white pear fructokinase genes identified in the
article were used as target genes for expression analysis in four different Chinese white pear
tissues (roots, stems, leaves, flowers).
Throughout the article, the experimental design was reasonable, the results of the study were
credible, and four types of fructose metabolism-regulated genes (FRKs) in the Rosaceae plant
were systematically elucidated. The expression characteristics of the FKs gene in Chinese white
pear were studied in depth, providing candidates for further functional analysis. Target gene. The
article has a high theoretical value and it is recommended to accept after minor revisions:
1. It is recommended to refer to the published results of qRT-PCR expression analysis of other
plant FRKs genes, from the perspective of comparing fructose content differences between plants,
in the discussion section on "Article Figure 5. China White Pear FRKs Gene in 4 Different Tissues
( The results of qRT-PCR expression analysis of roots, stems, leaves and flowers were discussed in
depth.
Reply: The reviewer raised a good and professional suggestion. We have referred the published
results of qRT-PCR expression analysis, and then discussed our results. However, after reviewing
a large number of published papers, we found that there are few papers on the relationship
between gene expression and changes in fructose content. So in this study we focused on the
function of the FRK genes and then presumed their role in the fructose content of pear fruit. (lines:
277-297 and lines: 304-315)
2. It is recommended to use VGSC(http://bio.njfu.edu.cn/vgsc2) to re-draw the collinearity
analysis graph of Figure 4 to improve the expressiveness of the graph.
Reply: This is a very good suggestion. I also think VGSC (http://bio.njfu.edu.cn/vgsc2) is a good
tool for displaying collinearity, but now it looks like it can't work. In the next study I will use this
tool to visualize the results of collinearity.
3. The manuscript will need to be carefully re-read and the grammar corrected (ideally by a native
speaker).
Reply: We sincerely thankful for the careful review from the reviewer. Our paper has been
polished by a professional American Journal Expert and a native English speaker.
