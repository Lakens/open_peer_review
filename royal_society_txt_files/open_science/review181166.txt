This is a well written paper that aims to determine the appropriate failure analysis for meniscus
tissues with cracks/tears, and to quantify strain concentrations arising near cracks in the tissue.
In particular, the authors did an excellent job in reviewing the mechanics and tying this to the
meniscus tissue, its function in the knee joint, and its pathology. The findings are interesting in
that they could provide new insight into the tissue pathology and need for and time sensitivity of
clinical intervention. Overall, the study is important and significantly adds to the current
knowledge. There are a few points that should be addressed/discussed.
How was the 3mm crack length chosen for this study? Is there a particular physiological
relevance to this size?
Frozen tissue samples were obtained from a commercial tissue source. Previous studies have
shown that freezing may alter the mechanical properties of cartilaginous tissues, especially if
there are multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Please discuss how this may influence your results, and if
any precautions were taking in tissue handling.
How old were the animals when the tissues were harvested? Meniscus composition changes
with age which may affect mechanical behavior; this should be discussed.
There was ample discussion about the radial positioning of the tissue samples used in this study.
Was there any effect of meniscus location (i.e., medial vs. lateral) on the failure mechanics?
Prevalence of meniscus tears differs between medial and lateral menisci (and has also been found
to be related to age). It would be interesting to see if this plays a role in the failure mechanism of
the tissue. This should be discussed as well.

This paper reports experiments to determine the effect of defects in meniscus. Cracks of length 2-
3mm were introduced into tensile test specimens. It was found that these cracks had no
significant effect on the strength of the specimens. This essentially negative finding is
nevertheless useful in building up our knowledge of how soft-tissue materials respond to defects.
There have been very few studies to date in which this problem is approached using the science
of fracture mechanics, so this work is to be welcomed.
The distribution of strain in the cracked samples was measured, showing some expected effects
(strain is greater near crack tips, less along the crack flanks) but also some interesting
observations about how the strain is distributed in specimens with different orientations. There is
also some nice microscopy leading to discussion of the operative mechanisms.
The paper is very well written, with clearly described methods, well presented results and an
extensive discussion well supported by references. I have a few suggestions and points for
discussion as follows:
1. Figure 1 makes an important point but in this form it’s a bit confusing, because on the
horizontal axis there are two different parameters: toughness and crack severity. It would be
better to redraw the diagram to emphasise this, for example you could have crack length along
the horizontal axis and then plot several lines representing different toughness values (or the
other way around).
2. The radial specimens were made without the usual “dog-bone” shape, and the result is that
most control specimens (15/23) failed on grip line, whilst very few cracked specimens failed this
was. This is a worry because it suggests that the tensile strength is actually higher than measured
here: failures on the grip line would normally be considered to be invalid results. This should at
the very least be mentioned, and perhaps the data could be reanalysed to compare the strength
measured in grip-line failures with that measured from the other specimens.
3. All cracks were same length (2mm or 3mm) and as the authors point out, these are smaller than
the meniscal tears which are normally considered to require clinical treatment. So it’s a pity that
some longer cracks could not have been tested, to find the limit at which a crack becomes
significant. I presume this was because of the practical difficulty of cutting out large enough
samples. It would be nice to include some simple theoretical estimates: knowing the tensile
strength (from the experiments) and the fracture toughness (which could be estimated from other
work in the literature) one can calculate a critical crack length for comparison with the
experimental crack lengths.
4. Likewise one can do some theoretical calculations to estimate the strain concentration ahead of
the crack and compare it with the measured values, which I think would be instructive.
5. Table 2: most of the descriptions are obvious but what is “mixed rupture”? We are referred to
[42] but it should be defined here anyway.
4
6. Line 52 onwards – it would be nice to have a figure here showing a typical stress-strain curve
to explain the various parameters, which may not be obvious to a non-specialist.
7. The large amount of variability in the data (evident from the stress/strain curves in fig.4) is a
problem, since it limits the ability to distinguish differences between the cracked and uncracked
groups. Would the researchers consider making paired specimens, i.e. cutting a piece from a
given meniscus and dividing into two pieces, one of which would be the cracked specimen and
one the uncracked? This would avoid the scatter than occurs from one meniscus to another,
though admittedly it would reduce specimen size.
9. The authors should comment some more on the rate of loading in their tests (expanding on a
comment near the end of the discussion) and how it might affect the results. Slower loading rates
might cause easier crack growth by creep, whilst under high loading rates the material may be
more brittle and so more sensitive to small cracks. Both might have clinical significance.

hank the reviewer for their kind remarks and for their recommendations.
> How was the 3mm crack length chosen for this study? Is there a particular physiological
relevance to this size?
agree that it is important to document the choices made during the study design. We have added the
wing text to the manuscript to clarify this point:
m a clinical perspective, the 3 mm crack length was chosen because it is representative of “short” tears (less
5–10 mm long) that have not yet grown to cause immediate clinical concern. From an engineering
pective, the 3 mm length is a compromise—long cracks are useful in that they produce larger stress
entrations, but the crack must be short enough so that the crack tip-associated failure zone has sufficient
e to develop fully and produce crack propagation in the fracture mechanics sense.
> Frozen tissue samples were obtained from a commercial tissue source. Previous studies have
shown that freezing may alter the mechanical properties of cartilaginous tissues, especially if
there are multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Please discuss how this may influence your results, and if
any precautions were taking in tissue handling.
agree that specimen storage and preservation is an important point. The effect of freezing or preservation
hods on tissue is a very complicated topic, with dozens of papers reporting conflicting findings. All
ible positions—freezing has no effect, vs. freezing is better than other options, vs. freezing is worse than
r options—have some degree of experimental support. Any procedure in which tissue is excised from its
or animal has the potential to alter the tissue's properties. Even “fresh” tissue must be transported from the
ghterhouse to the lab during which time the tissue is dying and undergoing autolysis. For space reasons we
only explore this topic in a limited capacity. We have augmented the methods and discussion sections with
ef summary of the available literature on the effects of freezing. We have also described in greater detail
rozen storage conditions. Given the results available in the literature, freezing may have slightly affected
umeric values reported (perhaps by ~ 10%), but as there is no evidence that freezing fundamentally alters
ind of mechanical behavior exhibited by tissue, freezing is unlikely to have affected the overall study
lusions.
> How old were the animals when the tissues were harvested? Meniscus composition changes
with age which may affect mechanical behavior; this should be discussed.
agree that the age of the animals is important. We have adjusted the methods text to clarify the age of the
als and that they were skeletally mature. Our study was not designed to compare separate age groups and
e is no prior report on the effects of meniscus aging in bovines, so unfortunately we have no new evidence
ntribute regarding aging. However, we do agree that age and pre-existing degeneration may contribute to
ormation of meniscus tears in vivo and have added this hypothesis and a brief discussion thereof to our
re directions subsection.
> There was ample discussion about the radial positioning of the tissue samples used in this
study. Was there any effect of meniscus location (i.e., medial vs. lateral) on the failure
mechanics? Prevalence of meniscus tears differs between medial and lateral menisci (and has also
been found to be related to age). It would be interesting to see if this plays a role in the failure
mechanism of the tissue. This should be discussed as well.
agree that anatomical heterogeneity is a very interesting subject that is worthy of investigation in future
k. Radial positioning was stressed because there are very large changes in composition from the red zone
niscus outer rim) to the white zone (meniscus inner rim), implying large mechanical differences (although
has not been definitively confirmed). In contrast, mechanical differences between medial and lateral
isci are known to be slight or nonexistent. Consequently, our study was not designed with statistical power
ake medial vs. lateral comparisons. We did perform this comparison as an internal quality control check,
found near-identical statistical distributions in mechanical properties between medial and lateral menisci,
as this comparison is under-powered that does not mean much. Previous work, however, does provide
gh information to address this comparison. Previous work reports no difference or slight differences (=
) in mechanical properties between medial and lateral meniscus; nothing that should produce a
amental change in mechanical failure mechanism. Overall, since there are an equal number of
radictory studies reporting lateral stiffness > medial stiffness and medial stiffness > lateral stiffness, the
t likely conclusion is that the medial and lateral menisci have identical mechanical properties. This
cates that differences in tear prevalence are caused by other factors, such as knee loading patterns. We
modified the text to include references to prior work that made lateral vs. medial comparisons.

have modified Figure 1 with the hope of clarifying that the choice of whether to use fracture mechanics
ysis to limit stress analysis is determined by the magnitude of the stress concentration relative to the
imen’s fracture toughness. For the purposes of this figure, these two parameters only have meaning in
ion to each other.

agree that the dog-bone shape and midsubstance failure are potentially important, to the extent that we
iously did an entire study on specimen shape and failure location with the same protocol we used in the
ent study:
quin, J.M., Santare, M.H., and Elliott, D.M. (2016). Advances in quantification of meniscus tensile
hanics including nonlinearity, yield, and failure. J Biomech Eng 138, 021002.
ifically, our 2016 study showed that the radial rectangle specimen geometry used in the present work
d at stress equivalent to radial dogbone specimens (n = 25 rectangles, 12 dogbones). The rectangle
imens even trended to have greater failure stress—there was no indication that they were mechanically
ior to the dogbones. Our 2016 study also compared at-grip failures to midsubstance failures and found no
rence between the two. This is not a result unique to our group; the following works also found no
rence between at-grip and midsubstance failures in tendon:

ons. Proc Inst Mech Eng H 219, 349–354.

lization and preservation. J Biomech Eng 118, 56–61.
se results strongly support the validity of the present study's protocol. However, we acknowledge that this
active area of research, and accordingly we have expanded the methods sections with a brief summary of
bove finding work by ourselves and others.
precautionary measure, we actually repeated, prior to submission, the crack vs. crack-free comparison for
al specimens using only midsubstance ruptures. (So many radial specimens were tested that this is possible
out too much loss of power; n = 11 midsubstance ruptured radial cracked specimens, n = 9 midsubstance
ured radial control specimens.) The results are statistically equivalent, and in fact nearly identical, to when

> 3. All cracks were same length (2mm or 3mm) and as the authors point out, these are smaller
than the meniscal tears which are normally considered to require clinical treatment. So it’s a pity
that some longer cracks could not have been tested, to find the limit at which a crack becomes
significant. I presume this was because of the practical difficulty of cutting out large enough
samples. It would be nice to include some simple theoretical estimates: knowing the tensile
strength (from the experiments) and the fracture toughness (which could be estimated from other
work in the literature) one can calculate a critical crack length for comparison with the
experimental crack lengths.
agree that it is a pity that larger specimens could not be tested. The limited size of a natural meniscus is
constraining. We also agree that it would be nice to have estimates for fracture toughness, but
rtunately there is no data in the literature for meniscus that is suitable for the calculation of fracture
hness values. As emphasized by Taylor and Simms (2012), calculation of fracture toughness first requires
lure that is demonstrably in the fracture regime of Figure 1, not the limit stress regime. Until such a case is
onstrated—which we hoped to accomplish with the present work—the meniscus’ fracture toughness
ains unknown. It should in principle be possible to calculate a lower limit for fracture toughness from our
ent results, but as the meniscus is nonlinear, viscoelastic, and exhibits finite strain, all of the simple
mation approaches are likely to be very wrong. Once an estimate is in the literature, it tends to persist even
after it is revised, so we would prefer not to report an estimate that we know will be misleading. We are
king on this problem and hope to report limiting toughness values in future work.

of the crack and compare it with the measured values, which I think would be instructive.
agree that theoretical calculations are a useful guide. We have previously published theoretical work to
mate the stress and strain fields near cracks, and these results were in part used to design the present study:

arding the estimation of the strain concentration ahead of the crack and comparison of this estimation with
measured values, current simulations of meniscus tissue, including ours, perform poorly in this application
use they rely on elastic material models. An elastic model does not represent damage, failure, plastic
rmation—all key processes observed in physical tests of cracked specimens. Nor is there a validated
titutive model currently available in the literature to describe meniscus viscoelasticity in tension. We are
king on this problem, but it is non-trivial. We hope to be able to perform the suggested theoretical
mation and comparison in future work. Indeed, the capability to simulate meniscus failure in the presence

added a forward reference to Figure 4 at that spot. Figure 4 shows yield and ultimate stress points and
hopefully help readers visualize these concepts.
> 7. The large amount of variability in the data (evident from the stress/strain curves in fig.4) is a
problem, since it limits the ability to distinguish differences between the cracked and uncracked
groups. Would the researchers consider making paired specimens, i.e. cutting a piece from a
given meniscus and dividing into two pieces, one of which would be the cracked specimen and
one the uncracked? This would avoid the scatter than occurs from one meniscus to another,
though admittedly it would reduce specimen size.
interesting that paired specimens are suggested, because we initially attempted to use paired specimens.
ppointingly, paired analysis turns out to be unhelpful. It does not reduce scatter compared to unpaired
imens, suggesting that most of the scatter comes from factors other than inter-meniscus differences.
hermore, due to the meniscus’ wedge shape, it is only possible to cut a full-width meniscus specimen in a
le plane that is about 2 mm thick. Paired specimens must therefore be cut about 4 mm narrower than
ired specimens, and the bisection plane must be perfectly aligned or both specimens are lost. Between
aps during specimen prep and gripping problems (failure inside the grips or grip slip), most pairs lose one
eir specimens at some point, making the paired analysis approach very inefficient. Nevertheless, we
isted using the paired approach long enough to find that it did not reduce scatter in the results; we then
doned it for an unpaired study design.

> 8. The authors should comment some more on the rate of loading in their tests (expanding on a
comment near the end of the discussion) and how it might affect the results. Slower loading rates
might cause easier crack growth by creep, whilst under high loading rates the material may be
more brittle and so more sensitive to small cracks. Both might have clinical significance.
agree that the rate of loading is potentially important, but at this point we can only speculate about how
rent loading rates would change the test outcomes. To address this comment, we have expanded the
ussion to reference other papers that varied strain rate, and have increased the emphasis on strain rate as a
ntial topic for future investigation.

to determine if a short crack in meniscus tissue, which

The strain fields were used as an indicator of

of a crack (potential effect < 0.86 s.d.; ß = 0.2),
but significant strain concentrations, which have the
potential to lead to long-term accumulation of tissue
or cell damage, were observed near the crack tip.

1 1. Introduction 2
2 Tears are the most common pathology to afflict the knee meniscus. Their direct symptoms include
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
3 pain, mechanical deficiency, and increased risk of osteoarthritis [1–4]. Meniscus tears can also
4 cause serious secondary harm, as the most straightforward treatment for a tear—partial or total
5 meniscectomy—further increases the risk of osteoarthritis [5–9]. Furthermore, repair of a torn
6 meniscus, especially when the tear is in the inner avascular region, is not always feasible [1,10].
7 Some in vivo meniscus tears occur suddenly, suggestive of immediate rupture from a single
8 overload event [11–17], whereas others grow over time [18,19]. Although short (< 5–10 mm)
9 tears often do not merit immediate clinical concern [15,15,20–22], they have the potential to grow
10 and become more serious with time. To aid efforts to prevent and to repair meniscus tears, it is
important to understand the mechanics of how they form and grow.
..............................................................

12 A meniscus tear, viewed from an engineering perspective, is a macroscopic crack-like defect.
13 In this work, “meniscus tear” will be used to refer to the clinical pathology, and “meniscus crack”
14 will be used in the engineering sense to mean a macroscopic crack-like defect in the meniscus,
15 regardless of whether it is a natural meniscus tear or an artificial crack-like defect such as a cut. A
16 crack typically creates a stress concentration at its tip, which often, but not always, causes crack
17 growth and reduces ultimate stress (maximum engineering stress prior to rupture) [23–25]. Study
18 of this type of failure comprises the field of fracture mechanics. The central question concerning
19 meniscus cracks is: do cracks reduce the stress-bearing capacity of meniscus tissue, or is meniscus
20 tissue insensitive to them?
21 The effect of a crack depends on the material’s fracture toughness and the severity of the crack-
22 induced stress concentration (Figure 1) [23,24,26]. If the stress concentration is large relative to
23 the material’s fracture toughness, it causes local rupture at the crack tip, crack growth, and a
24 reduction in ultimate stress (fracture mechanics region, Figure 1). In this case fracture mechanics
25 approaches should be used to quantify rupture. If the stress concentration is small relative to the
26 material’s fracture toughness, the crack has negligible effect, and the ultimate stress is equal to the
27 ultimate tensile strength (limit stress analysis region, Figure 1). In this case, limit stress analysis
28 (comparison of applied stress to material properties, such as ultimate tensile strength) should
29 be used to quantify rupture. Demonstration of limit stress analysis-dominant rupture would not
30 necessarily mean that defects such as microcracks are uninvolved in failure, but it would indicate
31 that the primary impetus of rupture was not macroscale crack growth. To permit accurate failure
32 analysis of meniscus bearing a short tear, it is crucial to determine if meniscus tissue containing a
33 short crack ruptures by fracture mechanics-dominant processes or limit stress analysis-dominant
34 processes.
35 The idea that the meniscus ruptures by fracture mechanics-dominant processes has some
36 experimental support. Meniscus tears grow in vivo [18,19], suggesting that crack growth in the
37 fracture mechanics sense may have a role. Superficial zone articular cartilage, which is similar
38 to meniscus, has been observed to rupture by fracture mechanics-dominant processes [26,27].
39 However, cracks in tendon, which like meniscus contains highly aligned collagen fascicles, tend
40 to become blunt instead of growing [28–33]. These findings suggest that limit stress analysis is
41 more appropriate for cracked tendon, and by extension possibly also for meniscus. It remains
42 uncertain which rupture process is relevant for meniscus, and mechanical tests are needed to
43 resolve this uncertainty.
44 To determine if cracked meniscus fails by fracture mechanics-dominant processes, we chose
45 to compare the ultimate stress of cracked meniscus specimens to identically tested intact control
46 specimens. This test has been specifically recommended for application to fibrous soft tissues
47 for which the dominant failure process is not known [26]. Cracked specimens were prepared
48 with crack length much longer than any pre-existing defects that may have been present. Because
49 stress concentration severity increases with crack length, cracked specimens will lie to the left of
50 the control specimens on Figure 1. If the cracked specimens lie in the fracture mechanics region,
51 they will have ultimate stress less than controls. If the cracked specimens instead lie in the limit

Figure 1. Schematic of ultimate stress variation with fracture toughness and stress concentration severity. Fracture
mechanics governs failure when a local stress concentration is large relative to the material’s fracture toughness. Limit
stress analysis governs failure when the material is sufficiently tough to tolerate any stress concentrations that are present.
In the fracture mechanics case, s u < s UTS ; in the limit stress case, s u = s UTS [23,24,26].
52 stress analysis region, they will have ultimate stress equal to the controls. Observation of either
53 outcome is valuable; either the results provide a necessary foundation to support subsequent
54 fracture toughness measurements, or they rule out risk of crack-induced weakness for the tested
55 crack geometry and loading conditions.
56 Independent of which process governs rupture, the potential for cracks to alter stress and
57 strain field within the meniscus is also of interest—specifically, the potential for near-tip stress
58 concentrations and unloaded regions on either side of the crack. A stress and strain concentration
59 may cause stress to locally exceed the elastic limit and hence cause local tissue or cell damage.
60 Conversely, unloaded regions may cause long-term cell-mediated degeneration by abolishing
61 mechanical signals necessary for homeostasis. The idea that a near-tip stress concentration
62 produces local damage is supported by the observation that tissue near the tip of a naturally
63 occurring meniscus tear takes less energy to rupture than tissue in a crack-free contralateral
64 control meniscus [21]. Concerning unloaded regions, a crack in a meniscus-mimicking synthetic
65 scaffold has been observed to reduce strain in the regions that include material cut by the crack
66 [34,35]. Quantification of any crack-induced stress–strain concentrations and unloaded regions is
67 needed to determine if these mechanical phenomena may have a role in meniscus tear pathology.
68 The particular objectives of this study were, for meniscus tissue with a short crack: (a) to
69 determine whether fracture mechanics or limit stress analysis is appropriate for failure analysis;
70 (b) to quantify strain concentrations in the region near the crack tip, and (c) to quantify the degree
71 of unloading in the cut material to either side of a crack. Meniscus specimens with and without
72 artificially introduced cracks were tested in both circumferential and radial uniaxial tension so as
73 to examine both fiber and matrix rupture phenomena, and because tensile load support is a key
74 aspect of meniscus function [36–41]. To test the hypothesis that meniscus cracks reduce ultimate
75 stress and cause rupture by fracture mechanics-dominant processes (objective a), ultimate stress
76 was compared between cracked and crack-free specimens as recommended by Taylor et al [26]. To
77 test the hypothesis that near-tip strain concentrations are present and to measure their magnitude
78 (objective b), strain fields were measured using digital image correlation (DIC) and strain in
79 cracked specimens was compared between their near-tip and away-from-tip regions. Similarly,
80 to test the hypothesis that the regions to either side of a crack, which contain cut material,
81 are unloaded (objective c), strain in cracked specimens was compared between their cut and 4
82 intact regions. Results are discussed in terms of their significance with respect to whole-meniscus
83 damage and failure.

84 2. Methods
85 (a) Specimen preparation
86 Specimens were prepared for three test groups—circumferential tension with a 90° edge crack,
87 circumferential tension with a 45° center crack, and radial tension with a 90° edge crack—with
88 corresponding circumferential and radial tension crack-free control groups (Figure 2). These tests
..............................................................
89 groups were chosen based on prior simulation results [42]. As established by prior work [43],
90 circumferential specimens were made with expanded grip regions to facilitate fiber loading.
91 Bovine menisci (age > 30 months & skeletally mature, mixed lateral & medial, mixed sex) were
92 purchased fresh-frozen from Animal Technologies, Inc. (Tyler, TX) and stored sealed in plastic
93 bags at -20 °C in a non-defrosting freezer. Freezing is the preferred preservation method for
94 mechanical tests of meniscus [44–53] and for meniscus allografts [54]. Medial and lateral menisci
95 were pooled because previous work has found only slight or no differences in mechanical
96 properties between medial and lateral menisci [52,53,55,56], so there was no reason to arbitrarily
97 exclude either group.

98 One specimen per meniscus was prepared using a Leica SM2400 sledge microtome, with a
99 freezing stage, to plane the meniscus to a target thickness of 1.0–1.5 mm, with the specimen plane
100 normal to the proximal–distal axis [57]. Including the microtomy, each specimen underwent 3–4
101 freeze-thaw cycles. The specimen was then trimmed to its final in-plane dimensions, its cross-
102 sectional area measured by scanning across its width with a laser displacement sensor [58,59],
103 and its surface airbrushed with Verhoeff’s stain to facilitate digital image correlation from test
104 video. Measured specimen dimensions are reported in Table 1. Except when the specimens were
105 being actively manipulated, they were kept covered under PBS-dampened gauze to minimize 5
106 dehydration.
107 Each edge crack was created by incision with a fresh #11 scalpel blade to a target length of
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
108 3 mm. Each center crack was created by incision with a fresh razor blade broken to the target
109 crack length of 3 mm. From a clinical perspective, the 3 mm crack length was chosen because it is
110 representative of “short” tears (less than 5–10 mm long) that have not yet grown to cause definite
111 clinical concern. From an engineering perspective, the 3 mm length is a compromise—long cracks
112 are useful in that they produce larger stress concentrations, but the crack must be short enough so
113 that the crack tip-associated failure zone has sufficient space to develop fully and produce crack
114 propagation in the fracture mechanics sense.

115 (b) Tensile test protocol
116 Tensile testing was done following standard procedures [43,45,47,48,50,52,57,60]. The tensile test
117 protocol consisted of (a) 20 kPa preload, which was used to establish the specimen’s undeformed
118 reference length, (b) 10 cycles of preconditioning to 4% grip-to-grip engineering strain, and (c)
119 stretch to failure. The displacement rate was 0.5 mm/s. Video of the test was recorded at 15 fps
120 and 1392 × 1000 px. The image scale was ~ 40 px/mm for circumferential specimens and ~ 60
121 px/mm for radial specimens.
122 Ruptures of tested specimens were classified according to published definitions [43]. Briefly,
123 midsubstance rupture means the rupture zone touched neither grip line, mixed rupture means
124 the rupture zone was in the midsubstance but touched at least one grip line, and grip line
125 rupture mean the rupture was entirely within 1 mm of a grip line. Tests with rupture or slip
126 inside the grips (longitudinal split, gripped region failure, or no rupture) were excluded from
127 analysis because mean stress in the failure region cannot be accurately calculated for these failure
128 types. The counts of each type of rupture are presented in Table 2. The counts of tests used for
129 analysis are given by group in Figure 2b. In prior work, grip line failures were often excluded from
130 analysis as a precautionary measure [45,57,61,62], although quantitative comparison of at-grip
131 and midsubstance failures in fibrous soft tissue has shown no difference [43,63,64]. In this study,
132 midsubstance, mixed, and grip line failures were all used for this analysis because, specifically
133 under the present test protocol, they are known to not differ in their stress–strain responses [43].
134 (c) Stress and strain data processing
135 The tensile tests’ stress (s)–strain (e) curves were summarized using ultimate stress s u , strain at
136 ultimate stress eu , tangent modulus (slope, measured at the yield point), yield stress, and yield
137 strain. (These points are visually marked in the results; see Figure 4.) Strain was calculated using
138 the current grip-to-grip length l and the reference grip-to-grip length l0 and reported as stretch
139 ratio (<U+03BB> = l/l0 ) or Lagrange strain ( = 1/2[<U+03BB>2 - 1]). The yield point was identified as the inflection
140 point in the stress–strain curve as done previously [43]. Note that for tissue tests the yield point is
141 not customarily equated with the elastic limit, in part because the role of plasticity with respect to
142 tissue remains ambiguous [43,65–71]. For cracked specimens, the uncut transverse cross-sectional

143 area (thickness × (total width - transverse axis component of crack length)) was used for stress
144 calculations.
145 Lagrange strain fields were computed across the specimen surface from the video recordings
146 using 2D DIC (Vic-2D 2009; Correlated Solutions, Columbia, SC) [31,43,72]. Three DIC strain
147 components were analyzed: longitudinal strain (grip-to-grip direction; Exx ), transverse strain
148 (Eyy ), and shear strain magnitude (|Exy |). The correlation window (subset size) was 0.7 ×
149 0.7 mm, and incremental correlation, exhaustive search, and low pass filtering were enabled.
150 Strain accumulation error from incremental correlation was negligible; for this test apparatus and
151 the number of frames analyzed, strain error for each pixel is = 0.001. Post-processing used a 15 px
152 exponential decay filter. Trial runs during study development showed that only the subset size
153 setting had a strong influence on the calculated strain field. The choice of 0.7 × 0.7 mm subset
154 size was a compromise between the needs of (a) minimizing spurious correlations, which favors
155 a large correlation window, and (b) retaining spatial resolution to identify strain concentrations
156 and inter-fascicle sliding, which favors a small correlation window.
157 Quantitative analysis of strain fields was done by comparison of strain statistics between
158 regions of interest (ROIs). To test for the existence of strain concentrations near the crack tip, the
159 DIC strain field was partitioned into near-tip and away-from-tip ROIs (Figure 5a). The ROI size
160 was chosen to be of similar size to the strain concentrations visible in the strain field images. The
161 near-tip ROIs for analysis of Exx extended, relative to the crack tip, +0.7 mm in the crack pointing
162 direction and ±0.7 mm in the loading direction. The near-tip ROI size was set to approximately
163 the subset window size because this is the smallest size that is reasonable for analyzing spatial
164 variation. The near-tip ROIs for analysis of Eyy and Exy were similar defined to extend +0.7 mm in
165 the crack pointing direction and, because features in the Eyy and Exy strain fields were elongated
166 in the loading direction, ±1.05 mm in the loading direction. To test for differences in strain
167 between tissue cut and not cut by a crack, “cut” and “intact” ROIs were also defined (Figure 7a).
168 Comparisons of DIC strain statistics between paired (a) near-tip and away-from-tip and (b) cut
169 and intact ROIs were made at stress levels from 0.25s u to 0.9s u for circumferential specimens
170 and, due to loss of DIC tracking at high strain for several radial specimens, 0.25s u to 0.7s u for
171 radial specimens. Measurement at relative stress levels ensures that each measurement reflects a
172 similar phase of the stress–strain curve across all specimens.
173 (d) Statistics and inference
174 The hypothesis that cracks reduce the ultimate stress of meniscus (related to objective a) was
175 tested using unpaired Welch t-tests to compare ultimate stress between cracked and control
176 specimens for each of the three test cases (circumferential tension 90° edge cracks, circumferential
177 tension 45° center cracks, and radial tension 90° edge cracks). Since this hypothesis was 7
178 specifically that cracked s u < control s u , comparisons were made using a one-sided t-test to
179 decrease the chance of type II error. The other stress–strain parameters did not have a specific
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
180 hypothesized direction of change and so were compared between cracked and control specimens
181 with two-sided t-tests. The type I error rate for all statistical tests was set to 0.05.
182 The hypothesis that cracks generate strain concentrations near their tips was tested by
183 comparing DIC strain (objective b) in the near-tip ROI to the away-from-tip ROI (Figure 5a).
184 Similarly, the hypothesis that cracks reduce strain in the region containing cut material (objective
185 c) was tested by comparing DIC strain in the cut ROI to the intact ROI (Figure 7a). The between-
186 ROI differences in DIC strain as t-tests had skewed and very heavy-tailed distributions, making

190 (a) Effect of cracks on stress–strain curve parameters
191 Whether fracture mechanics or limit stress analysis is appropriate for failure analysis of cracked
192 meniscus tissue was determined by comparing ultimate stress (s u ) for each group of cracked
193 specimens with its corresponding control group (Figure 3; see Figure 1 for rationale). None of the
194 crack groups (circumferential 90° edge crack, circumferential 45° center crack, and radial 90° edge
195 crack; Figure 2) had ultimate stress significantly less than their corresponding controls (p > 0.2
196 for all). The study had power = 0.8 to detect a 0.86 s.d. decrease in circumferential ultimate stress
197 and a 0.78 s.d. decrease in radial ultimate stress, so this negative result indicates that there was no
198 meaningful difference. Therefore the specimens failed by limit stress dominant processes.
199 The other stress–strain curve parameters—strain at ultimate stress, tangent modulus, yield
200 stress, and yield strain—were also compared between the crack groups and their controls (Figure
201 3). The full table of stress–strain curve statistics is provided in supplemental information (Table
202 S1), and the stress–strain curves are plotted in Figure 4 for qualitative comparison. Due to the large
203 number of radial specimens, it was possible to (as a precaution) also do the radial analysis with
204 only midsubstance failure tests (Table S2); this produced results equivalent to the full analysis
205 (Table S1). Tangent modulus and yield stress were significantly greater in circumferential 90° edge
206 crack specimens by 1.5–6.8 MPa and 18–88 MPa respectively (95% CIs). No other stress–strain
207 parameter comparison showed a significant difference between the crack and control groups.
208 (b) Effect of cracks on strain fields
209 The presence of crack-induced strain concentrations was tested by comparing, for each specimen,
210 mean DIC strain near and away from the crack tip. Longitudinal strain (Exx ) was significantly
211 greater near the crack tip for all groups at every stress level examined (Figure 5). Transverse
212 strain (Eyy ) was not significantly different near the crack tip in circumferential tension specimens,
213 but for s = 0.5s u was significantly more compressive near the tip in radial edge crack specimens.
214 Shear strain magnitude (|Exy |) was significantly greater near the crack tip in circumferential
215 edge crack specimens for s = 0.8s u and in circumferential center crack and radial edge crack
216 specimens for all stress levels examined. The complete table of strain field statistics is provided
217 in supplemental information (Table S3). These results demonstrate that cracks in meniscus tissue
218 create strain concentrations at their tips.
219 The strain fields were qualitatively examined in terms of the near-tip strain concentrations’ size
220 and shape, as well as the strain fields’ overall appearance. Strain fields for three representative
221 cracked specimens are shown in Figure 6. Strain fields for control specimens were similar to
222 those reported previously [43]. The mottled appearance of each test’s strain field, specifically the
223 pattern of blobs of positive and negative strain, was established early in the test (~ 0.01 strain)
224 and retained the same pattern through failure.

225 Although the strain fields showed great variation between specimens, they had some
226 consistent features. The near-tip Exx concentrations in circumferential and radial specimens
227 tended to be small and subtle, extending ˜ 0.5 mm from the crack. In radial specimens, the
228 near-tip Exx concentrations sometimes (5/17 tests) grew to extend across the specimen as s
229 approached s u and as rupture progressed from the crack tip. Near-tip Exy concentrations in
230 both circumferential and radial specimens took the form of bands that extended longitudinally
231 across 50–100% of the specimen. The crack-associated Exy bands switched sign between sides of
232 the crack. For all strain components, strong strain concentrations tended to develop at multiple
233 places within each specimen. Exx and Eyy were on average greater near the crack tip because a
234 strain concentration occurred there consistently across specimens, not because it was uniquely

235 strong within each specimen. Exy concentrations, however, were more specific to the presence of
236 a crack; in ~ 1/3 of circumferential tests and ~ 1/2 of radial tests, the strongest and most extensive
237 shear band was crack-associated.
238 To test if the cracks created unloaded regions in cracked specimens, mean strain in the cut ROI
239 (on the crack flanks) was compared to the intact ROI (Figure 7; also plotted as an attenuation
240 ratio in Figure S1). Mean Exx in the cut ROI was significantly less than in the intact ROI for all
241 crack groups at all stress levels. In edge crack specimens, both circumferential and radial, this
242 effect almost completely abolished Exx in the cut ROI. Mean Eyy in the cut ROI in circumferential
243 specimens was not significantly different from the intact ROI, but in radial specimens it was
244 significantly greater than in the intact ROI. Mean |Exy | in the cut ROI of circumferential edge and
245 center crack specimens was less than in the intact ROI, whereas in radial specimens it was greater.
246 As Exx is the strain component most directly related to longitudinal stress, the large reductions in
247 the cut ROIs’ mean Exx values indicate that the crack did unload the cut ROI.
248 (c) Rupture morphology
249 Rupture morphology of cracked specimens, particularly whether rupture occurred by crack
250 growth, was summarized to support interpretation regarding rupture mechanisms. Rupture in
251 the circumferential edge crack specimens proceeded predominantly by inter-fascicle sliding,
252 creating broad, irregular ruptures with extensive interdigitating fiber pullout (Figure 8a). In 13

253 out of 14 circumferential edge crack tests, the region near the crack tip was the first to display
254 visible rupture, but the crack blunted rapidly by inter-fascicle shear (Figure 8b) and final rupture
255 occurred simultaneously over a broad region. Crack blunting by inter-fascicle shear began very
256 early in the test, between 0.2s u and 0.5s u . Rupture in circumferential center crack specimens
257 occurred similarly, except that the ruptures at the crack tip were smaller and developed in parallel
258 with separate sites of rupture at the grip line (5 tests) or specimen edge (9 tests). These separate
259 sites of rupture typically joined the crack-associated rupture as they grew (10 tests; Figure 8c).
260 Inter-fascicle shear was ubiquitous in both edge and center crack circumferential specimens, and
261 often caused the rupture line to zigzag across the specimen between zones of interdigitating fiber
262 pullout; a striking example is shown in Figure 8d.

263 Radial specimens, unlike circumferential specimens, sometimes displayed crack growth
264 (incremental, local rupture growing from the crack tip) (Figure 8e). In 9/17 radial tests, the crack
265 tip-associated rupture grew incrementally such that total rupture occurred by crack growth. In 5
266 of these 9 tests a separate site of rupture developed away from the crack in parallel with the crack
267 growth. Crack growth did not begin until strain approximately reached eu ± 0.2eu . The 8/17
268 radial tests with no sign of crack growth ruptured such that the site of rupture touched the crack
269 in 3 tests (Figure 8f) and was away from the crack in 5 tests. Most (16/17) radial tests had some
270 degree of local rupture at the crack tip even if this did not translate into crack growth. Regardless
271 of the type of rupture, the rupture site was bridged by small fibers (Figures 8e,f). Although in
272 the circumferential specimens the fascicle interfaces appeared to facilitate the formation of shear
273 bands, in the radial specimens they appeared to facilitate incremental crack growth.
274 The effect of a crack on the type of rupture (midsubstance, mixed, and grip line) was examined
275 by comparing counts of rupture types between cracked specimen groups and their controls (Table
276 2). Circumferential edge crack specimens had significantly more mixed ruptures, fewer grip line

282 4. Discussion
283 (a) Summary of key findings
284 This study’s objectives were to determine whether a short crack in meniscus tissue reduces the
285 meniscus’ ultimate stress in tension and hence requires failure analysis by fracture mechanics
286 methods and, furthermore, to determine whether a crack alters the strain field by creating a

287 near-tip strain concentration and an unloaded region in the cut material on either side of the
288 crack. No reduction in ultimate stress in cracked specimens was detected relative to controls
289 (Figure 3), indicating that limit stress analysis is appropriate for failure analysis, and that fracture
290 mechanics analysis is not required, in the tested conditions. Since the study was adequately
291 powered to detect a meaningful (~ 1 s.d.) decrease in ultimate stress, these results are robust
292 evidence for preservation of ultimate stress in the presence of a short crack. Regarding strain
293 concentrations, greater tissue strain was observed near the crack tip (Figure 5), implying the
294 existence of a corresponding near-tip stress concentration. Consistent with the presence of near-
295 tip strain concentrations, the region containing material cut by the crack (the cut ROI) had reduced
296 strain, implying that it was partially unloaded (Figure 7). Although the alterations in the strain
297 field did not measurably influence the meniscus’ rupture in terms of the overall stress–strain
298 curve, the near-tip stress concentration does pose a risk of sub-rupture local tissue damage.
299 (b) Significance of preservation of ultimate stress
300 The preservation of ultimate stress in cracked specimens and the tendency for ruptures to occur
301 simultaneously through the entire cross-section implies a high degree of resistance to crack
302 growth (fracture toughness). Although half of radial specimens exhibited crack growth, this
303 occurred at or past the ultimate stress point, by which time rupture was well underway by other
304 mechanisms. There was no evidence of unstable crack growth. This crack growth may therefore
305 be considered incidental, similar to the final fracture of a highly tough and ductile test piece [25].
306 High fracture toughness is desirable for meniscus because the maintenance of strength, despite
307 the presence of a crack, lessens the risk of further failure and loss of function. Note that a crack
308 will still reduce the cross-sectional area and, in proportion, the total force that the meniscus can
309 support. However, the present study’s results indicate that short (~ 3 mm) tears in single-cycle 14
310 loading are unlikely to accelerate failure by crack growth.
311 Longer cracks, in principle, produce stronger stress concentrations. In vivo meniscus tears that
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
312 are considered to definitely require clinical treatment are 5 mm to 25 mm long [15,20–22]. These
313 tears may exceed the critical crack length for fracture mechanics-dominant rupture (i.e., fracture)
314 [73]. However, the apparently low risk associated with a short (natural) tear is still beneficial
315 because it should delay the growth of the tear to a critical size. Attempts to replace meniscus
316 tissue with engineered materials should consider replication of the meniscus’ fracture toughness
317 as a design requirement.
318 This assessment of low risk for a short meniscus tear has caveats, as it is based on excised
319 tissue tests with test conditions that were, by necessity, artificial. Specimen size and hence crack
..............................................................
320 length was small, only edge and center cracks were examined, specimens were cut only from
321 the center of the meniscus, specimens were loaded only in circumferential and radial uniaxial
322 tension, cutting specimens may cause loss of fiber integrity, the loading rate was relatively slow
323 (0.5 mm/s), and unlike the natural enthesis tensile grips work by compression and friction rather
324 than by individually anchoring each fiber. Use of dead and previously-frozen tissue could also
325 in principle have affected the results, although prior work indicates that freezing has a small
326 (~ 10%) or no effect on fibrous soft tissue properties, and it has not been shown to alter their
327 fundamental mechanical behavior [74–83]. In vivo, tears come in a wide variety of geometries and
328 the meniscus is subjected to surface contact and multiaxial, heterogeneous stress [36,37,41,55,84–
329 87]. Considerable work remains to develop laboratory test methods that reproduce the wide
330 variety of loading conditions under which the meniscus must function in vivo, and to quantify
331 damage and failure in those conditions. Pending development of more advanced methods,
332 however, the present results support a low risk of total rupture due to short tears.
333 (c) Significance of crack tip strain concentrations
334 Although cracks did not decrease the meniscus specimens’ ultimate stress, they did create regions
335 of greater strain near their tips. These strain concentrations were substantial. Depending on the
336 test scenario and stress level, mean longitudinal strain was increased by 20% to 50% and mean
337 shear strain magnitude was increased by 20% to 80% (Figure 5). Groups with more complete
338 unloading of the cut ROI (circumferential and radial edge crack specimens) also had greater near-
339 tip Exx concentrations, consistent with load redistribution around the crack being the cause of
340 the strain concentrations. This near-tip overstrain has potential to cause local damage and failure
341 under normal load levels. Damage is generally reported to begin at 0.05–0.08 strain in tendon and
342 ligament [88–91], with one study showing a damage threshold ˜ 0.02 strain [92], but thresholds
343 for damage or permanent deformation are not known for meniscus. If the meniscus is similar
344 to tendon and ligament, the stress threshold at which a crack makes meniscus tissue vulnerable
345 to damage would be 25–50% of its tensile strength; that is, 9–17 MPa. At these stress levels, crack
346 blunting via inter-fascicle shear was prevalent in circumferential edge and center crack specimens
347 and rupture from the crack tip along fascicle boundaries was prevalent in circumferential edge
348 crack specimens. These findings indicate that the near-tip shear concentrations facilitated sliding
349 and rupture at the fascicle interfaces. Furthermore, the existence of zones of weakness near the
350 tips of natural meniscus tears suggests that damage due to strain concentrations also occurs in
351 vivo [21]. Local strain concentrations created by cracks in meniscus tissue therefore pose a high
352 risk of causing local, sub-rupture damage.
353 (d) Combined interpretation of preservation of ultimate stress and strain
354 concentrations
355 The preservation of ultimate stress and general lack of crack growth in cracked meniscus tissue
356 stands in contrast to the high risk of local damage due to strain concentrations near the crack tip.
357 These risks may have an inherent trade-off. Fracture toughness represents the energy required 15
358 for crack growth. Local energy dissipation around the crack tip (in the process region) increases
359 fracture toughness [23,26]. The observed near-tip zone of local overstrain and probable damage
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
360 may function as a dissipative zone, with the function of increasing toughness and limiting
361 crack growth. Inter-fascicle shear, which was especially strong in circumferential specimens, may
362 increase the meniscus’ toughness by absorbing energy through fascicle sliding. Inter-fascicle
363 sliding also deflects the path of rupture along fascicle boundaries (e.g., Figure 8d), which due
364 to the circumferential specimens’ geometry promotes rupture by processes other than mode I
365 crack opening and crack growth. In radial specimens, the parallel alignment of the fascicles
366 and the crack prevented fascicle sliding from acting as a crack deflection mechanism, which is
367 probably why half of radial specimens exhibited crack growth, albeit still without measurable
..............................................................
368 impact on ultimate stress. The roles of local damage, plasticity, and crack deflection as toughening
369 mechanisms in the meniscus warrant further investigation.
370 Strain concentrations near the tip of a meniscus tear, when subjected to long-term repeated
371 loading, may cause incremental accumulation of damage and failure. In the circumferential tests,
372 shear strain concentrations extended 5–10 mm from the crack tip along fascicle boundaries and
373 were halted by the grip line. In vivo they would not be restricted in this manner and hence could
374 provide a path for progressive growth of circumferential, bucket handle, vertical, or horizontal
375 tears [55,85,93,94]. A strain concentration may also kill or damage cells even in a single loading
376 cycle. In ligament, cell death has been shown to follow a linear no-threshold relationship with
377 applied strain [88]. A meniscus tear is also likely to cause regional unloading as observed here
378 for artificial cracks (Figure 7), which may lead to pathology due to cells’ dependence on load to
379 maintain homeostasis [95–97]. Altered cell loading and incremental accumulation of tissue and
380 cell damage may mediate long-term development of in vivo meniscus pathology.
381 (e) Increased tangent modulus and yield stress in edge crack
382 circumferential tests
383 The observation of greater tangent modulus and yield stress in edge crack circumferential tests
384 compared to controls (Figure 3) was unexpected and its cause is indeterminate. One possibility
385 is that it occurred by chance; i.e., that it is a type I statistical error. A second possibility is that
386 the inner margin of a circumferential specimen has an effective stiffness less than the outer
387 margin. If so, the edge crack, by eliminating the low-stiffness inner margin from the intact cross-
388 section, would cause the average modulus to increase. A lesser effective stiffness in the inner
389 margin implies that the ultimate stress for circumferential edge crack specimens should have also
390 increased; this is neither confirmed nor ruled out by the data (p = 0.07, post-hoc two-tailed t-test).
391 A lesser effective stiffness in the inner margin of circumferential specimens, if present, could have
392 been caused by differences between the inner and outer margins in either (a) material properties
393 or (b) fascicle loading.
394 The meniscus’ material properties, specifically tissue composition and stiffness, have been
395 observed to vary with radial position in the meniscus [55,93,98–100]. However, these comparisons
396 were of the outer, central, and inner thirds, and the specimens in the present study were all cut
397 from the central third. Electron microscopy and histology show homogeneous composition in the
398 central third [101,102]. There is no prior evidence that the inner margin of specimens in the present
399 study should have significantly different material properties from the rest of the specimen. The
400 observation of greater tangent modulus and yield stress in edge crack circumferential specimens
401 is therefore unlikely to have been caused by variation in material properties with radial position.
402 A reduction in fascicle loading within the inner margin of circumferential specimens could
403 have been caused by the specimens’ geometry. The meniscus’ fascicles are aligned in arcs, but
404 the specimens’ edges were straight. A portion of the inner margin’s fascicles were therefore
405 discontinuous with the gripped region and were loaded indirectly by inter-fascicle shear. The
406 fascicle interfaces are apparently compliant and shear readily (Figures 6 and 8b), so load transfer
407 to the discontinuous fascicles is likely to be slight. This effect has been quantified in annulus 16
408 fibrosus and tendon [33,103]. The inner margin’s fascicles may therefore be relatively unloaded,
409 contributing little to the stiffness of the specimen. Unloading of inner margin fascicles would
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
410 artificially decrease the average modulus in circumferential control and center crack specimens,
411 which have an intact inner edge, but not in edge crack specimens because the crack eliminates
412 these inner margin fascicles from the load-bearing cross-sectional area.
413 The potential for fascicle unloading due to the mismatch between straight sides of
414 conventional tensile test specimens and their arced fascicle geometry deserves further
415 investigation. Interactions between specimen geometry and fiber continuity have been previously
416 shown to alter the meniscus’ apparent tensile properties [43], prompting the use of expanded grip
417 regions. However, the present tangent modulus and yield stress results suggest that the meniscus’
..............................................................
418 arced fascicle architecture remains a challenge. In vivo, the meniscus’ entheses likely provide
419 much more efficacious fiber loading than is currently possible in laboratory tests.
420 (f) In vivo tear growth and future directions
421 The general lack of crack growth observed in this study, especially in the circumferential tension
422 tests, leaves the mechanisms by which meniscus tears grow in vivo uncertain. In particular,
423 it would be very useful to resolve uncertainty regarding the duration for which a short in
424 vivo meniscus tear can be expected to remain short and hence low-risk. The observation of
425 crack growth along fascicle boundaries in half of the radial specimens suggests that meniscus
426 microstructure is important, although many in vivo tears do cross fascicles. Age and pre-existing
427 degeneration may also contribute to tear formation and growth [104]. Age > 60 years is a moderate
428 risk factor (OR = 1.8–3.0) for meniscus tears, although they afflict patients of all ages [105–108].
429 High cycle loading, as has recently been undertaken for crack-free meniscus [44], is an especially
430 promising approach. Loading rate is another potentially important factor. With greater strain
431 rates, the meniscus is known to stiffen in compression [109,110] and possibly also in tension [111].
432 Meniscus tears often occur in the context of sports, implying involvement of high-rate loading
433 [7,108], and ex vivo impact testing of rabbit knees has produced meniscus tears [112,113]. It is
434 possible that a high-rate loading cycle (as would be expected from an impact) can produce a long
435 (5–25 mm) tear of clinical concern immediately, without slow growth from a low-risk short tear.
436 Although the focus of this study was on tensile loading, examining the behavior of meniscus
437 cracks under shear is also a promising direction for soft tissue [26,71,114]. The central task
438 for future experiments is to produce physiologic growth of cracks under controlled laboratory
439 conditions so that the mechanisms and time course of this pathology can be quantified.
