The paper provides a very helpful review of the testing methods and standards. I only have
minor comments.
The potentially adverse ecological impacts of biodegradable plastics in unmanaged aquatic
environments are alluded to in the introductory sections. The gaps and shortcomings of
laboratory based tests are also well explained; however the ecological impacts of the incomplete
degradation are mentioned more briefly. Additional short comment on the implications for
ecological impacts of the continued lack of more appropriate testing and standardisation would
be beneficial. For example an important repercussion may be that when tests for unmanaged
fresh water environments are improved new products will be developed to pass those tests but
may eventually end up in marine environments.
In line 84 it could be elaborated briefly that contrary to the impression of helping to remediate
(not mitigate) littering, a rebound effect can actually ensue if the public perception is that the
environmental burden is minimised or solved.
In Line 204 providing more examples of the kinds of biodegradability and the corresponding
conditions of interest would make the paragraph more informative for a wider audience.
If the information is available, it could be helpful to point out whether any the sources in line 434
also recognise, in addition to the impacts of additives on biodegradation rates, the impacts the
ecological impacts those additives could have.
In line 493 the importance of the similarity of bioplastics with other polymers would be clearer
and more assertive without the parentheses.
In line 514 it would be informative to provide examples, if available from sources 81-84, of
organisms that can be affected and the corresponding kinds of damage.
In line 767 the phrase “(including composites and additive-containing plastics, and materials of
varying shapes and sizes)” is one of the most important insights and instead of a brief clause in
parentheses should be expressed more prominently.

Overall, an enjoyable and though provoking read. I thought the introduction was too long and
detailed, and would benefit from been made more concise with some of the detail moved to the
main body of the text. At page number 75-78 I originally wrote the following:
• How will so biodegradable carrier bags mitigate littering? I am assuming that the authors are
assuming that the material will be 100 % biodegradable with no toxic residues left behind. Also,
this may increase littering rates in some communities because people will think it just disappears.
• Boost recycling – How? If the materials are really biodegradable, they may degrade during
recycling processes; therefore, hindering recycling. Also, I believe that recycler do not want
biodeg materials in their mix as it reduces the quality of the recycled end-product.
• Circular economy – How? Bio-based economy maybe. But not circular. If it degrades, it is lost
and cannot be reused.
But, as I went further I see that some of these issues were answered. It seems that this sentence
needs a re-write, such as where does this ‘theory’ come from, who or whom is stating this are a
theory?
In section 2, I am not so sure about using oxo-degradable as an example of a biodegradable
technology. Although, it is sometime referenced as one, it isn’t, it promotes fragmentation (out of
sight out of mind approach to manging field applied plastics). The authors should use it as a
misleading term. The authors should consider nano-clay or starch as a promoter of microbial
activity.
Sections 3 and 4 are very strong.
Section 5, I feel is a little weak and I am not such what this section is really trying to say. There
are many studies that have investigated the biodegradation of different polymers (including
those considered biodegradable) under environmental conditions, although they may not follow
specific test standards. Example include:
Weng et al (2013) Polymer testing. Vol 32. Investigated biodeg of PLA blends in soils
Saad et al. (2010) Journal of polymer research. Vol 17. Soil burial of PHB
Sadi et al. (2010) polymer degradation and stability. Vol 95. Also PHB films
Whereas, these studies use polymers rather than the plastic end-product, they general conclude
that abiotic pre-treatment acts as a first step in weakening the polymer structure. This initiates the
formation of oxygenated compounds and low molecular weight hydrocarbons, which are
4
recognized by microbial communities and can be utilized as a food source. But without initial
sunlight exposure even biodegradable polymers do not biodegrade within the timeframe of a
funded research programme. So once the polymer is mixed with additives to make a useful
plastic, even a biodegradable one, what hope is there?
Something along these lines should be included the give section 5 more depth and clarity.

e paper provides a very helpful review of the testing methods and standards. I only
e minor comments.
e potentially adverse ecological impacts of biodegradable plastics in unmanaged
uatic environments are alluded to in the introductory sections. The gaps and
rtcomings of laboratory based tests are also well explained; however the ecological
acts of the incomplete degradation are mentioned more briefly. Additional short
mment on the implications for ecological impacts of the continued lack of more
propriate testing and standardisation would be beneficial. For example an important
ercussion may be that when tests for unmanaged fresh water environments are
roved new products will be developed to pass those tests but may eventually end up in
rine environments.”
ank you for this valuable suggestion. We have incorporated the following sentences as
additional paragraph at the end of the manuscript (L783–792 in the revised version):
nally, the interconnected nature of freshwater and marine ecosystems should be taken
consideration when developing novel approaches to assess the biodegradability of
stic materials. Since environments such as wastewater treatment facilities and rivers
as important conduits for the transport of plastic litter to marine habitats [5], the
icipated retention time of the test material within the environment of interest will be a
topic to consider when determining a suitable test duration (§3.3). Products that pass a
degradability test that has been exclusively developed for freshwater environments may
exhibit extremely slow rates of biodegradation if they become deposited within marine
bitats, with direct repercussions for their environmental impacts and fate [16].”
line 84 it could be elaborated briefly that contrary to the impression of helping to
ediate (not mitigate) littering, a rebound effect can actually ensue if the public
ception is that the environmental burden is minimised or solved.“
have revised the sentence as follows (L75–80 in the revised version):
has also been suggested that the widespread use of biodegradable plastic bags would
best have no effect on littering, and at worst could exacerbate the problem by
oducing partially decomposed materials into the environment, as well as reducing
ial responsibility, for example via reinforcing the perception that using these products
imises or even negates the adverse environmental impacts of plastic waste [16–18].”
e word “mitigate” was used in an earlier sentence (line 76 in the original submission)
d has been deleted (see response to Reviewer 2 comments).
Line 204 providing more examples of the kinds of biodegradability and the
responding conditions of interest would make the paragraph more informative for a
er audience.“
viewer 2 also suggested that we modify this part of the manuscript (see below). To
ount for comments from both Reviewers, it now reads as follows (L169–176 in the
ised manuscript):
deed, biodegradability is often defined in relation to the purpose or the conditions of
rest, with separate standards and test methods having been developed for aerobic and
aerobic wastewater, freshwater environments and marine habitats (§3.1.1 and §3.1.2).
veral OECD classifications for biodegradability exist, depending on biodegradation test
formance and whether the term is taken to mean complete mineralisation by
roorganisms or an alteration in the chemical structure of a material due to biological
ivity (summarised in [33]). There is also widespread (…)”

nicola marina [82, 83]. Exposure to polystyrene nanoplastics has been shown to
uce population growth in the algal species Scenedesmus obliquus, as well as affecting
body size and reproductive behaviour of Daphnia magna [84]. Further, exposure to
ystyrene microplastics has been found to influence the feeding behaviour and
roductive output of the copepod Calanus helgolandicus [85].”

terials of varying shapes and sizes)” is one of the most important insights and instead

agree this could be expressed more clearly. The parentheses have been deleted and
information is now presented as follows (L742–747 in the revised version):
key methodological issue associated with existing procedures is the lack of clear
delines for the analysis of different polymer types, including composite materials and
stics that contain additives. There is also a paucity of guidelines for materials of varying
pes and sizes and, in certain cases, the test procedures lack a sufficient level of

ank you for the positive feedback. We have condensed the introduction from 1464
rds to 1169 words, with a focus on sections that could be re-edited without losing
rmation that is essential to interpreting the rest of the manuscript. However, to keep the
nuscript easy to follow, the original order of presentation has been retained.
page number 75-78 I originally wrote the following:
How will so biodegradable carrier bags mitigate littering? I am assuming that the
hors are assuming that the material will be 100 % biodegradable with no toxic residues
behind. Also, this may increase littering rates in some communities because people will

lost and cannot be reused.
, as I went further I see that some of these issues were answered. It seems that this
tence needs a re-write, such as where does this ‘theory’ come from, who or whom is
ting this are a theory?”
agree that this sentence (lines 75-78 in the original submission) is potentially
fusing. It has now been deleted and the section reads as follows (L69–73 in the revised
mission):
ne advantage of bio-based polymers is that they can provide an alternative to fossil fuel-
ived plastics. Given the right conditions, they can also be broken down into water,
mass and gas. Their application as an alternative to traditional polymers, however, is
without challenge [15].”
section 2, I am not so sure about using oxo-degradable as an example of a
degradable technology. Although, it is sometime referenced as one, it isn’t, it promotes
gmentation (out of sight out of mind approach to manging field applied plastics). The
hors should use it as a misleading term. The authors should consider nano-clay or
rch as a promoter of microbial activity.”
e focus of our submission is on reviewing different biodegradability standards and test
thods that could be used to evaluate the performance of a wide range of materials and
duct types. Because of this, we have aimed to maintain a technology-neutral standpoint
en preparing the manuscript. While comparing different biodegradability technologies
uld therefore be beyond the remits of the submission, we have revised this part of the
t so that it no longer refers to any specific material type or technology (see response to
viewer 1 for a full reproduction of the modified section).
ctions 3 and 4 are very strong.”

hough there is an extensive body of primary research into polymer biodegradation
hin natural environments, many studies have not followed specific biodegradability
ndards, as noted by the Reviewer. Our review focuses on standards and test methods
eloped for aquatic habitats, with Section 5 providing examples of peer-reviewed
cles where they have been used (and used to develop new methodological
proaches). The section also serves to highlight the surprising lack of research in this
a. In our view, expanding this section to cite further studies that do not follow particular
ustry standards or test methods – or that concern plastic biodegradation within non-
uatic environments, including soils – would be beyond the scope of the manuscript. The
uences of abiotic parameters including the availability of light (as well as temperature
d nutrient availability) on the likely biodegradation behaviour of single-use carrier bags
also discussed elsewhere in the manuscript (e.g. Section 3.2 and 3.3).
