This manuscript describes a model for mouse lens growth supported by empirical data. Overall,
it is a very nice paper that thoroughly addresses an important topic using a relevant organ
system, the lens. Overall, the manuscript is very thoughtful and well described. However, there
are a few places where minor changes could improve readability.
1. In the abstract, I would not state that "The epithelium stratified", as the lens is not really a
"stratified" epithelium like the epidermis. I would chose a better word. Also the authors should
state that their growth model starts on E14.5, as they do later in the methods. Finally, the
appendices suggested that the authors are using determinate finite difference equations. If this is
correct, they should state so in the abstract.
2. In Figure 3, the arrows indicating width and thickness in teh schematic could have the same
color as the data points, to ease interpretation.
3. In section 3.31, the two paragraphs at the top of page 9 are terse and difficult to understand on
a first read through.
4. On page 12, the "offspring branching mechanism Z" should be better defined (without having
to go to an appendix).
5. In the equation on page 13, following the text "In our case, we typically have E(Z) close to 1,
implying that the factor", the minus symbol preceding the 1 in the denominator is merged into
the preceding fraction bar of 1/lambda.

In this study “A full lifespan model of vertebrate lens growth”, Hrvoje Sikic and co-workers
conducted a combination of experimental and mathematical modeling studies to propose a
quantitative model that explain growth of a model tissue, the mouse ocular lens, over the animal
lifespan.
Understanding tissue growth into the adult size is one of the most important questions of
quantitative developmental biology. Although there are several genetic models (c-Myc, Hippo-
Yap signaling, etc) that probe this question, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms
remain poorly understood. For genetic studies to probe this system, it is essential to develop a
model for normal lens growth that incorporates all potential variables. The model can be further
explore to probe aging process in the lens and lay the foundation for our understanding of much
longer growth of primate lenses which is highly relevant to the common problem in the human
population, presbyopia.
The main strengths of the manuscript are its general significance coupled with earlier published
studies refs [4,5] from this group regarding this topic. The current model derivation incorporates
age-dependent changes of each individual cell division parameter, cell compaction, and flow of
cells across the CZ/PGZ border.
Taken together, the present study sheds new light into the cellular and molecular formation of
mouse lens differentiation. The data are of excellent technical quality. The conclusions are sound
and not overinterpreted. The manuscript is very appropriate for publication in Royal Society
Open Science. A few minor issues should be addressed in the revised manuscript.
Minor points:
1. Section 2.2.1. The sentence “Of note, the rate of apoptosis is low [4].” needs rephrasing as
the data measure number of cells typically expressed as percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis,
not the rate of the cell disintegration.
2. Correct typos in subtitles 3.3.1 and 3.3.2. The equation at the bottom of page 12 seems be
incomplete.
3. Is the paper “Zhou M, Leiberman J, Xu J, Lavker RM. A hierarchy of proliferative cells
exists in mouse lens epithelium: implications for lens maintenance. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci.
2006 Jul;47(7):2997-3003” relevant for the present study?
4. Discussion 4.1 (second paragraph). If the authors used stages early-middle-late, then, the
sentence “In the young lens, …” should be rephrased, e.g. “In the early embryonic lens,…”

The manuscript entitled "A full lifespan model of vertebrate lens growth" by Sikic, Shi, Lubura
and Bassnett represents an interesting and valuable attempt to describe in mathematical terms the
growth of the mouse lens through development. The authors elegantly explained their model
which they supported both with their own data and with previously published data from other
authors. This manuscript builds upon previous publications by these authors that form the best
understanding we have concerning lens epithelial behavior and growth through time. I do have
a few points that the authors might wish to address.
1. the authors mention fiber cell compaction with time (section 3.4). I am wondering if fiber cell
compaction over time has been directly measured. The authors used a linear compaction factors
of 0.020% and 0.025% to correct for loss of fiber cell volume from 6 months to 2 years and 2 to 4
years, respectively. Are these compaction factors calculated from previous observational data of
actual lenses?
2. Sellitto, Li and White (2004) IOVS 45:3196-3202 also explored epithelial cell proliferation in
mouse lenses and reported a significant increase in lens epithelial cell proliferation after birth,
peaking between P2 and P3 before declining thereafter. Does the model take this postnatal
proliferation increase into account? My understanding of the manuscript suggests that lens
epithelial cell proliferation rates steadily decline after E14.5. Is there a discrepancy between the
current model and this previous observation of wild type lens epithelial cell proliferation
dynamics?
3. In the legend for figure 6, the authors should explicitly say that the closed circles represent data
taken from the literature.

Response to Reviewers
We thank the three reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive comments. Specific responses are
shown below.
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript describes a model for mouse lens growth supported by empirical data. Overall, it is a
very nice paper that thoroughly addresses an important topic using a relevant organ system, the lens.
Overall, the manuscript is very thoughtful and well described. However, there are a few places where
minor changes could improve readability.
1. In the abstract, I would not state that "The epithelium stratified", as the lens is not really a
"stratified" epithelium like the epidermis. I would choose a better word.
- We have reworded this section.
Also the authors should state that their growth model starts on E14.5, as they do later in the methods.
- We now indicate that the model starts on E14.5.
Finally, the appendices suggested that the authors are using determinate finite difference equations. If
this is correct, they should state so in the abstract.
- We thank the reviewer for highlighting the fact that our stochastic model also includes some
deterministic elements. This should probably have been emphasized more clearly in the text and we
have revised the abstract accordingly. We did not use the term “finite difference equations” explicitly,
since this is a particularly designated term in mathematics, which refers to the “finite difference method”
(FDM, for short). As the reviewer is doubtless aware, FDM is used particularly for differential equations,
where differences of the form (f(x+h) – f(x))/h are applied as approximations of the derivative of a
function f. Our context here is somewhat different, but we do have iterative formulae to describe the
effect of immigration and emigration between the various zones of the epithelium and within a discrete
time interval. These formulae include both stochastic (random number of offspring) and deterministic
elements.
2.
In Figure 3, the arrows indicating width and thickness in the schematic could have the same color as the
data points, to ease interpretation.
- The arrow color has been altered as suggested.
3. In section 3.31, the two paragraphs at the top of page 9 are terse and difficult to understand on a
first read through.
- The paragraphs have been reworded to improve clarity.
4. On page 12, the "offspring branching mechanism Z" should be better defined (without having to go to
an appendix).
- The text has been modified and the branching mechanism described explicitly in Section 3.6.
5. In the equation on page 13, following the text "In our case, we typically have E(Z) close to 1,
implying that the factor", the minus symbol preceding the 1 in the denominator is merged into the
preceding fraction bar of 1/lambda.
- Corrected.

measure number of cells typically expressed as percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis, not the rate of
the cell disintegration.
- Rephrased to “of note, apoptotic cells are rarely if ever detected in healthy lenses”
2. Correct typos in subtitles 3.3.1 and 3.3.2.
- Corrected.
The equation at the bottom of page 12 seems be incomplete.
- Corrected (it was a problem with the PDF file conversion)
3. Is the paper “Zhou M, Leiberman J, Xu J, Lavker RM. A hierarchy of proliferative cells exists in mouse
lens epithelium: implications for lens maintenance. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2006 Jul;47(7):2997-
3003” relevant for the present study?
- We are familiar with the paper by Zhou et al. That manuscript describes the presence of label retaining
cells (LRCs) in the central region of the mouse lens epithelium. LRCs are cells that have not divided
since being labeled with tritiated thymidine in utero. The number of LRCs falls during postnatal
development such that the proportion of LRCs in the 4-month-old lens is just a few percent. In ongoing
work, we are calculating the number of divisions individual lens epithelial cells must undergo to generate
a lens of the required size. In a probabilistic system such as that employed in our model, some epithelial
cells will divide many times over the lifetime of the lens, whereas a small fraction (located at the far end
of the frequency distribution) may not divide at all post-natally. We suspect that the latter correspond to
the LRCs detected by Zhou et al. In future studies, we hope to directly compare the frequency
distributions derived from our model with the empirical data of Zhou et al.
4. Discussion 4.1 (second paragraph). If the authors used stages early-middle-late, then, the sentence
“In the young lens, …” should be rephrased, e.g. “In the early embryonic lens,…”
- This sentence has been rephrased.
Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript entitled "A full lifespan model of vertebrate lens growth" by Sikic, Shi, Lubura and
Bassnett represents an interesting and valuable attempt to describe in mathematical terms the growth
of the mouse lens through development. The authors elegantly explained their model which they
supported both with their own data and with previously published data from other authors. This
manuscript builds upon previous publications by these authors that form the best understanding we
have concerning lens epithelial behavior and growth through time. I do have a few points that the
authors might wish to address.
1. the authors mention fiber cell compaction with time (section 3.4). I am wondering if fiber cell
compaction over time has been directly measured. The authors used a linear compaction factors of
0.020% and 0.025% to correct for loss of fiber cell volume from 6 months to 2 years and 2 to 4 years,
respectively. Are these compaction factors calculated from previous observational data of actual lenses?
- It is generally agreed that compaction occurs in the lens, but the phenomenon is poorly understood at
both the mechanistic and morphological level. Observations in human lenses suggest that nuclear
compaction probably occurs earliest and is most profound, but there are no useful quantitative data to
guide us. It is likely that the age-dependent increase in the proportion of dry weight observed in the
lenses of almost all species is a measure of ongoing compaction. But dry weight measurements
performed on whole lenses provide little insight into what might be happening in the various layers of
the lens. In the absence of accurate empirical measurements our approach in this paper was completely
ad hoc. We simply determined how big the lens should be (according to the model) and compared it to
our own measurements of radial lens growth. We than applied a linear correction to reconcile the two
data sets. In ongoing experiments, we are using microscopic techniques to try to quantify the loss of
fiber cell volume over time. If successful, such measurements will allow us to more realistically model
the compaction phenomenon.
2. Sellitto, Li and White (2004) IOVS 45:3196-3202 also explored epithelial cell proliferation in mouse
lenses and reported a significant increase in lens epithelial cell proliferation after birth, peaking between
P2 and P3 before declining thereafter. Does the model take this postnatal proliferation increase into
account? My understanding of the manuscript suggests that lens epithelial cell proliferation rates steadily
decline after E14.5. Is there a discrepancy between the current model and this previous observation of
wild type lens epithelial cell proliferation dynamics?
- The present data are in keeping with the observations of Sellitto et al. Cell proliferation data are
provided in Table 1. Although our measurements have lower temporal resolution than the previous study
we also observed a transient increase in cell proliferation rate at about P3 (right hand column, “r” in
Appendix C). This temporary increase was accounted for in the model and has an impact on the growth
kinetics.
3. In the legend for figure 6, the authors should explicitly say that the closed circles represent data
taken from the literature.
- The legend has been amended to state explicitly that the closed circles represent literature values.
