This is basically a good paper that adds significantly to the corpus of data concerning the age and
environment of deposition of the Older River Gravels, which are an important unit in the Middle
to Late Pleistocene regional development of GB. My comments are all very minor and perhaps
more food for thought. They are annotated on the attached manuscript (Appendix A).

Comments by Dr Ian S. Evans, Durham University, on Buckland et al.,
Mid to Late Devensian landscape change in England.
A thorough analysis of stratigraphic and palaeontological/palaeoecological observations from
this important site in eastern England is provided by a group of experienced scientists.
Observations over a number of years as the quarry face progressed improve the reliability of
interpretations. The numerous illustrations are well drawn and relevant: the photos are well
selected.
The section 6.1 Discussion usefully compares the temperature ranges (summer and winter)
implied at Finningley with those from other MIS 3 sites. Using the Greenland record, the authors
correctly state that interstadials and stadials alternated within MIS 3, yet it is difficult to follow
the implications of the various dates and temperatures in the text which (despite the conclusion)
3
reads as if there is some expectation of uniform conditions throughout MIS 3. The dates
tabulated below Fig. 16 do not put things into chronological order. Section 6.1would be aided by
a summary temperature: chronology Figure plotting each observation as a box, with its range of
calibrated dates and its range of Tmin and (separately) Tmax. (There are 13 date ranges
mentioned in the text, i.e. 13 boxes.) The text could then be shortened and clarified.
I think the title could be improved: it does not cover England and there is little on Late
Devensian. I suggest ‘Mid Devensian climate and landscape in eastern England’ would be more
accurate as the first sentence of the title.
Readers are expected to be familiar with detailed terminology in several fields: sedimentology,
botany and zoology. Possibly terms such as ‘flaser’ and ‘stenotherm’ might be defined.
Below I suggest a number of corrections and some cases where the expression can be polished.
There is a tendency to use too many commas, making complicated sentences with too many
qualifications: some could be split, e.g. lines 18-22 and 30-33 on page 6.
DETAILS:
Page 1: Line 39 ‘seek to’ is anthropomorphic. ‘data can …’?
52 drop one of the 2 boths
55 perhaps ‘Britain’ (or even ‘England’) rather than UK?
Page 2: Line 1 ‘showed’
2 ‘the limit’
18 ‘setting, in’
34 ‘deep-water’ rather than profundal
41 ‘from both’
43 delete comma
Page 3: 13 ‘were collected’
13-14 delete present commas: insert comma before ‘and’.
14 ‘was revealed’
18 ‘was placed’
20 delete second ‘then’
25 ‘that for’
29 Should Stratigraphy be section 5.1? – and later sections renumbered.
31 delete first comma
49 delete first comma
Page 4: 21 ‘which are interpreted’
Page 5: 2 ‘river Idle. It is interpreted as being ’
11 ‘non-preservation’ !
48 ‘whereas others indicate’
Page 6: 5.3.1 is italicised, unlike any later subsection headings…
2 ‘:’ rather than ‘;’
6 ‘appear’
16 One comma too many! Delete last, ‘[82] and occurring’.
26 ‘suggested’
41 Give name before [99] ?
Page 7: 28 remove comma. Split the following sentence?
30 ‘it is found’
39 delete last comma
39-40 “in papers published in” makes no sense, as the three following citations are normal
papers, not collections.
40 replace ‘;’ with ’,’
44 ‘BP at Clettnadal’
54 ‘arctic-equivalent’
Page 8: 13 ‘between … and’
58 ‘glance a similarly’
Page 9: 11 6. Not 6.6.
4
16-17 past tense, especially for 2001 !
56 summer-winter-summer?? Rewrite sentence.
Page 10: 1 The sentence ending ‘Queensford.’ is a non-sentence. It should be combined with the
following, or re-written.
8: Replace second ‘;’ with ‘and’. This is another clumsy sentence.
24: ‘near continent’
39/40 ‘;’ or ‘,’ ?
Page 11: top – excess ‘11’
11 ‘suggests that around’
14 ‘and 11’

34 1. Summary
35
36 Whilst there is extensive evidence for the Late Devensian, less is known about Early and Middle Devensian (~110 to 30
37 ka) climates and environments in the UK. The Greenland ice-core record suggests the UK should have endured multiple
38 changes but the terrestrial palaeo-record lacks sufficient detail for confirmation. Data from Finningley, South Yorkshire,
39 seek to redress this. A channel with organic silts, dated 40,314 - 39,552 cal a BP, contained plant macrofossil and insect
40 remains showing tundra with dwarf-shrub heath and bare ground. Soil moisture conditions varied from free draining to
41 riparian, with ponds and wetter vegetated areas. The climate was probably low-arctic with snow cover during the winter.
42 Mutual Climatic Range, based on Coleoptera, shows mean monthly winter temperatures of -22 to -2°C and summer ones
43 of 8 to 14 °C. Periglacial structures within the basal gravel deposits indicate cold-climate conditions, including
44 permafrost.
45 A compilation of MCR reconstructions for other Middle Devensian British sites shows MIS 3 between 59-28 ka to
46 include substantial variation in climate consistent with the Greenland ice-core record. Exact correlation is hampered by
47 temporal resolution but the Finningley site stadial at ~40 ka may correlate with one of the Greenland Stadials 7 to 11.

2. Introduction
51
During the Late Quaternary the UK was subjected to multiple cold stages, leading to both periglaciation and glaciation,
52 both of which sculpted the landscape. Recent research has started to address systematically the pattern and chronology of
53 the British and Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS), particularly during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ~21 ka) and Lateglacial (e.g.
54 [1,2,3]). During the LGM (although not necessarily synchronously) the BIIS extended to the Scilly Isles [4] in the south-
55 west of the UK and to Norfolk in the south-east (e.g. [5]). Less is known about the climate and environments in the UK
56 Early and Middle Devensian (~110 to 30 ka). Rasmussen et al. [6], based on Greenland ice-core records, show 25 stadials
57 and 24 interstadials between 110 ka and the start of the Holocene (~11.7 ka) but the extent and duration of Devensian
58 glacial ice in the UK prior to the LGM is less certain. Whilst Straw [7,8] has argued for two distinct Devensian advances

of ice as far south as Lincolnshire and Yorkshire (figure 1), one LGM and another at some time pre-LGM, evidence for
this was not found by [9] in Yorkshire or Lincolnshire, where the two Marsh tills of Straw were reinterpreted as two
1
oscillations within the LGM ice advance. Carr et al. [10] show extensive ice across northern England and Scotland during
2
the Ferder episode ~70 ka in Marine Isotope Stage 4 (MIS), although this limit is not well constrained by evidence. Clark
3
et al. [2] show that by 27 ka (MIS 2) once again much of northern England and Scotland were covered by ice, suggesting
4 that initiation must have occurred sometime before that in MIS 3. Roberts et al. [5] showed ice advanced southward
5 down the North Sea to Dogger Bank, withdrew by ~23.1 ka before advancing to its maximal position on the Norfolk
6 coast ~22.8–21.5 ka. During the Devensian, periglaciation took place beyond the ice limits, with regional patterned
7 ground and involutions dated to 60-55 ka (MIS 3), 35<U+2012>31 ka (MIS 3), 22<U+2012>20 ka (MIS 2) and 12<U+2012>11 ka in eastern England
8 [11]. The Devensian cold periods were interspersed with warmer interstadials [12, table 3.4], most notably the Chelford
9 Interstadial (MIS 5c, ~108<U+2012>92 ka [13,14,15]), the Brimpton (MIS 5a, ~86<U+2012>72 ka [16,17]) and the Upton Warren (early
10 during MIS 3 [18]; possibly ~42.5<U+2012>38.5 14C ka, according to Catt et al. [19]). However, the chronologies, environments
11 and climatic conditions associated with these interstadials remain not well understood. For example, aminostratigraphy
12 suggests that the Upton Warren Interstadial significantly pre-dates MIS 3 [20]. In summary, whilst the Greenland ice-
13 core record would suggest the UK landscape should have endured multiple climatic and environmental changes, at
14 present studies of the terrestrial palaeo-record lack sufficient detail to confirm this.
15
16
17 This study reports observations from one of the UK's main onshore sedimentary basins which contains Pleistocene
18 deposits laid down in a proglacial setting in order to elucidate further the Middle to Late Devensian terrestrial palaeo-
record and landscape change in eastern England. The study takes a detailed multi-proxy approach to both sediments and
19
preserved fossils found at a site close to the Late Devensian ice limit at Finningley, South Yorkshire. Results are
20
evaluated in the context of other dated Middle Devensian sites for which palaeoclimatic or palaeoenvironmental
21
information exists.

25 3. Regional Setting (figure 1)
26 East of Doncaster the Sherwood Sandstone Group dips gently beneath the Quaternary deposits of the Humberhead
27 Levels. The detailed mapping by Gaunt [21,22,23] provide the basis for a regional Quaternary stratigraphy (figure 2),
28 with the oldest deposits being ascribed to the Anglian (MIS 12) represented by heavily cryoturbated sands and gravels
29 found on the north<U+2012>south ridge between Bawtry and Rossington (cf. [24,25]). The overlying Older River Gravel (ORG;
30 [26,22]) forms a gently undulating surface sloping northwards from Austerfield through to Hatfield, where it meets a
31 similar fan of gravels relating to the Don drainage [22, figure 41]. A flora and insect fauna from within the ORG at
32 Austerfield indicates a MIS 5e age [27], although Coope [28] raises the possibility of a MIS 9 age. It seems probable that
the ORG may represent deposits from several glacial–interglacial cycles.
33
More recent general reviews of the regional Quaternary stratigraphy are provided in Bateman et al. [29] and Gaunt et al.

[30] but eastwards and northwards these deposits are overlain by those of the ‘25 ft Drift,’ littoral sands and profundal
35
clay<U+2012>silts of proglacial Lake Humber. (Hemingbrough Glaciolacustrine Formation; [31]). Lake Humber is thought to
36 have formed in the Vale of York when North Sea ice blocking the Humber Gap at Ferriby. Gaunt [21, 22] interpreted the
37 regional stratigraphy in terms of a two-stage model, with shorelines at approximately 33m and 7m (25 ft Drift). Whilst
38 the existence of a high level lake has been challenged [32, 33, 34], its transient nature, leading to limited deep-water
39 deposition, has been stressed by Bateman et al. [35] and its relationship with a short-lived extension of a western tongue
40 of the Vale of York glacier has recently been considered by Friend et al. [36]. Recent optically stimulated luminescence
41 (OSL) ages both from lacustrine and regional glacial sediments [35, 37, 38, 39, 40] indicate a LGM age for both phases,
42 although the sequence appears more complex than Gaunt [22] originally suggested [41, 42].
43 The quarry at Finningley, lies east of the Finningley to Austerfield road at Crow Wood (figure 3 A & B; Lat. 53° 28’
44 20”N; Long 00 59’ 02” W). It was worked as a series of west–east faces (figure 3 and figure 4). The relationship between
45 these small outcrops, the ORG and 25 ft Drift was progressively revealed in 2001<U+2012>7 as quarrying proceeded southwards
46 (figure 4).

4. Methods
50 4.1. Section logging, sediment characterisation and
51
52 dating
53 A number of vertical sections were cleaned back, recorded and scaled photomontages prepared (figure 5 and figure 6;
54 Supplementary material figs 1 and 2). Included on these were sediment texture and colour (using Munsell colours),
55 primary and secondary sedimentary structures, bed contacts, sediment body geometry as well as observations on clast
56 form and lithology.
57 To support this work, key units were sampled for particle-size analysis using a CILAS 940 laser diffraction particle
58 analyser. For each measurement, samples retaining their field moisture were dispersed in de-ionised water and underwent
59 ultrasound prior to measurement. Results were used to determine mean particle size and sorting as per Gale and Hoare
60 [43].
Samples for OSL dating were collected by hammering lightproof PVC tubes into freshly cleaned exposures. In the
laboratory, the samples were prepared to clean and extract quartz as per Bateman and Catt [44], using the grain-size

fractions 90<U+2012>180 µm. Samples were measured in a Risø DA-12 luminescence reader. Equivalent doses (De) were
1
determined using the SAR protocol [45] with an experimentally determined preheat of 240ºC for 10 s. Results show
2
rapid decay of OSL dominated by a fast component and good growth with laboratory dose. Replicate Palaeodose (De)
3
values for sample Shfd02010 had a very low over-dispersion (7%;) and so the De value used for age calculation was
4 based on the Common Age Model [46]. Dosimetry was calculated via ICP with elemental concentrations converted to
5 dose using data from Guerin et al. [47], taking into account attenuation factors relating to sediment grain sizes used,
6 density and palaeomoisture. The latter was set at 23±5% based on estimations of sediment saturation potential, and
7 assumptions of groundwater levels based on the region’s palaeoenvironmental history as is presently understood. The
8 Prescott and Hutton [48] algorithm was used to calculate the cosmogenic derived dose rate.

11 4.2. Organic lens
12 Within a series of cut-and-fill channels sealed by a diamict (unit 3, see below) occurred occasional lenses of dark brown
13 organic silt. Three 3 litre samples were processed for plant and animal macrofossils. Two (S1–2), collected in 2001, from
14 a channel (figure 7), close to the western edge of the pit and another (S3) revealed in 2006 further to the northeast. The
15 latter was recorded in a section from which any overlying Lake Humber clay<U+2012>silts had been removed prior to excavation
16 of sand and gravel deposits; both appear to relate to pools on an aggrading floodplain with flow in a northeasterly
17 direction.
18 Samples of the organic silts were placed directly into polythene bags and sealed. Each was disaggregated in water over a
300 µm sieve and the residue retained on the mesh placed in a bowl and paraffin (kerosene) added. This adsorbs onto the
19
surface of insect remains, and when water is added the light oil and insects float and can be decanted off. The float was
20
then washed in detergent to remove the paraffin, cleaned with methanol and then sorted under a low-power binocular
21
microscope (cf. [49]). Preservation in Sample 1 was insufficient to warrant further work and Samples 2 and 3 were
22 utilised for plant macrofossil and insect identification. As the amount of plant material was slight, only a few tens of
23 grams, the material was recombined and the easily identified seeds of crowberry, Empetrum nigrum/hermaphroditum,
24 were separated for material for accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating. Taxonomy for plant macrofossils follows
25 The Plant List [50], for Coleoptera Böhme [51] and Trichoptera Graf et al. [52].

Stratigraphy
31 At the west end of the pit (~4 m OD), a north<U+2012>south section, parallel to and close to the Finningley to Austerfield road,
32 exposed over 3m of sands and gravels, shallowly cross-bedded to the north (1 on figure 3 B & figure 5). The series of
west-east sections exposed as quarrying progressed southwards (2 & 3 on figure 3 B & figure 4) provided more complete
33
sequences. The stratigraphic sequence (figure 6) is numbered and described from the quarry floor upwards:
34
35 Unit 1 sand and gravel
36 Unit 1, as exposed, comprised at least 2 m of reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) sands and gravels (Gm) directly overlying the
37 sub-horizontal eroded upper surface of the Sherwood Sandstone (figure 6). This unit is massive, although occasionally
38 stratified to crudely stratified with localised cross-beds. Clasts comprising rounded to sub-rounded quartzite pebbles and a
39 few cobbles with some imbrication were observed where not disturbed (see below). The unit appears completely
40 decalcified and the upper part is penetrated to 1.5 m by involutions, festoons and wedge features. Ice-wedge
41 pseudomorphs up to 28 cm wide were infilled with sandy gravel or open-work gravel with vertically aligned elongate
42 pebbles (figure 8). The downturned beds of the host material suggest that this fill was secondary, once ice had melted.
43 Given that the wedge tops are found within unit 1, these ice-wedge pseudomorphs are considered intraformational. This
44 unit is interpreted as being the ORG of Gaunt [22].
45
46
Unit 2 Infilled channel
Unit 2 has been eroded into the underlying sands and gravels of unit 1, forming an infilled channel (figure 7). Within this
47
channel was a series of cut-and-fill structures, sometimes bedded lenses of sandy gravel, sands (Gms, brown, 7.5YR 4/5)
48
and clay<U+2012>silts (Fm, dark greyish brown, 10YR 4/2). Of particular note was a 25 cm thick lens of thin-bedded slightly
49
contorted, organic silt with sandy partings (figure 7) which was sampled for plant macrofossils, insects and radiocarbon
50 dating (samples 1–2).
51 Given that the channel infill contains gravels through to fine-grained material, unit 2 is interpreted as indicating a range of
52 fluvial flow regimes with the clay and organic lenses representing low flow, possibly in overbank or channel marginal
53 settings. Whilst the contortion of the organic and clay lenses could be due to cryoturbation, it probably results from post-
54 depositional de-watering. The unit indicates multiple cycles of cutting and infilling of small channels which switched
55 position through time, typical of a braided-stream environment with peaked flows associated with a periglacial
56 environment.
57
58 Unit 3 diamict
59 Unit 3 comprises a massive 1<U+2012>1.5 m thick matrix-supported poorly sorted silty-clay diamict (Dmm, on average 50%
60 gravel, 25% sand, 25% silt<U+2012>clay). This showed considerable lateral variability in colour and texture. Where the deposit
sits on higher ground, it is thinner and more heavily involuted, appearing more red (strong brown 7.5YR 4/6). Where the
diamict sits on sandier facies of the underlying sands and gravels it too is sandier (strong brown 7.5YR 5/6), and where
sitting on gravels it is more clast-rich. In places the uppermost part of this unit appears laminated and contains occasional

dropstones. Sections showed some discontinuous traces of bedding and deformed U-shaped lenses of dark greyish brown
(10YR4/2) silty sand or greyish-brown (10YR 5/2) silty-clay lenses aligned parallel or sub-parallel to the lower contact.
1
The clasts, up to cobble size, are dominated by sub-rounded to rounded quartzites ultimately derived from the Sherwood
2
Sandstone. The lower boundary of the unit, where it overlies unit 1, appears sharp, erosive and irregular, infilling low
3
points in the underlying unit. Flame structures of sand and gravel extend up to 50 cm into the diamict in variable
4 directions (figure 9). Where unit 3 overlies unit 2 folds and sheared bodies of the silty sand within unit 2 were observed.
5 The upper boundary is also irregular with apparent downward intrusions of sand (figure 9).
6 The incorporation of rounded quartzite clasts is interpreted as indicating reworking of unit 1 and therefore a local rather
7 than regional derivation for this diamict. Given the apparent limits of the LGM ice in the Humberhead Levels to the north
8 (Friend et al. 2016) [36], a glacial origin is improbable, leaving either solifluction or a sub-aqueous mass flow similar to
9 that inferred in Klassen & Murton [53] as possibilities. The absence of erratics, beyond those derived from either the
10 ORG or underlying Fluvio-Glacial Sands and Gravels (sensu Gaunt [22]), can be accounted for by solifluction of locally
11 derived sediments and fits with the periglacial environment at the time of deposition as judged from the associated
12 involutions. The fines contained within the diamict (25% silt<U+2012>clay), would have made it frost-susceptible and these along
13 with any permafrost could have created saturated conditions at the base of the active layer. However, whilst the diamict
14 thins considerably as it rises to the west up an interfluve, suggesting an association with topography, present-day relief to
15 allow either form of flow is limited. Gaunt [22] maps similar deposits as ‘Head’ (= solifluction deposit) in the shallow
16 valley to the north of the quarry and there are more extensive deposits, which were perhaps continuous with these before
17 the area was levelled for the expansion of Finningley (now Doncaster Sheffield Airport) airfield during the Second World
18 and Cold War. It has been observed that sub-aqueous flows are often overlain by a drape of silty clay resulting from
19 suspension settling from the water column. This is similar to the deposits that are found above or involuted into the top of
20 the diamict. This clay drape, where it has not been modified by subsequent cryoturbation, has ripples on the surface of the
21 diamict (figure 9), which is interpreted as shallow-water reworking after the deposition of the diamict. In this
22 interpretation, a corollary is the temporary existence of a lake, impounded at the Humber Gap.
23 Unit 4 stratified sand
24 Unit 4, 2.5 m thick, is dominated by medium to fine (mean = 143 µm) sand which is moderately to poorly sorted (mean =
25 1.09) and reddish-yellow (5YR 6/6) grading to strong brown (7.5YR 5/6). It contains some comminuted fragments of
26 coal, occasionally graded out in a distinct lens. The unit has faint sub-horizontal stratification (Sr/Sl) with some channel
27 or cross bedding and symmetrical and asymmetrical ripples (up to 10<U+2012>20 mm in height) whose surfaces are accentuated
28 occasionally by clay drapes, for example in the form of flaser bedding (figure 10 A). Ripple crests are orientated
29 approximately east<U+2012>west. In one long, cleaned exposure it was possible to see sigmoidal bed forms within the sand,
30 indicating deposition in a littoral environment (figure 10 and figure 11). Symmetrical ripple forms have either peaked or
31 rounded crests (figure 5 and figure 11 B), both representing wave ripples, and the peaked ones characteristic of formation
32 in very shallow, near-emergent conditions. Also within this unit were a number of thin silt<U+2012>clay horizons (mean = 7 µm,
33 sorting = 1.54, 75% silt, 20% clay), including a persistent subunit of dark-grey (5YR 4/1) laminated clay<U+2012>silt which was
34 approximately 20 cm thick (figure 10 A), and present in all exposures examined. This subunit contained alternating dark
35 grey and reddish brown laminae, horizontally oriented and separated by sharp contacts. The subunit is interpreted as
36 varves, and a 30 mm long pebble within it as a dropstone. Luminescence samples were collected from above and below
37 this persistent clay<U+2012>silt subunit.
38 Numerous structures within this unit suggest it underwent post-depositional deformation. Vertical sand pipes ~2 cm wide
39 cut across part of the varved silt<U+2012>clay subunit, causing it to bifurcate into two in places with sand between the two parts
40 (figure 11A). These structures are interpreted as dykes of sand injected up from below forming sand sills within the
41 silt<U+2012>clay subunit. The upper part of this unit was strongly deformed with water-escape structures. Also towards the top,
some irregular and rather chaotic vertical to subvertical structures are developed, including one prominent flat-bottomed
42
‘sag’ structure (approx. 80 cm in height) infilled with massive to faintly laminated sand containing silt<U+2012>clay blocks at the
43
toe, and with adjacent downturned strata and stepped normal faults in the host strata (centre of figure 11A). Other
44
examples overlie sand dykes and sills, including one structure comprising grey silty-clay blocks trailing upwards from the
45 top of the varved unit (figure 11B). Such structures clearly involved movement of some sediment downward and/or
46 upwards, and they are interpreted as sediment-injection / dewatering structures, indicating that at least the upper part of
47 this unit underwent soft-sediment deformation. Further evidence of soft-sediment deformation is provided by load casts
48 and diapirs (figure 11C)—which formed by loading processes—and by dish structures (figure 11D)—which formed by
49 upward water escape. The upper boundary to this unit was sharp and largely planar.
50 A glaciolacustrine origin for unit 4 is inferred from the occurrence of varves and a dropstone. The abundance of wave
51 ripples indicates an open-water body. Peaked symmetrical ripples suggest that this at times experienced very shallow,
52 near-emergent conditions, whereas round crested symmetrical ripples may have developed in deeper water [54] or formed
53 by reworking of ripple crests during emergence [55]. Wave activity may have triggered dewatering of the loosely
54 consolidated lake sediments, producing the extensive array of soft-sediment deformation structures. This unit is correlated
55 with the Littoral Sands and Gravels of Gaunt et al. [23] associated with Lake Humber.
56
57
Unit 5 laminated clay–silt
58 Unit 5, as exposed, was ~65 cm thick but thinned towards the west. This consisted of uniform, horizontally laminated
59 clayey-silt (80% silt, 20% clay), compact, and dark-grey (10YR 4/1) in colour, with occasional sandy partings. The mean
grain size was 4.0<U+2012>78 µm and sorting was between 1.28 and 1.41. Calcium carbonate concretions and occasional pebbles,
60
interpreted as dropstones, were also observed. Lamination thicknesses varied from 1<U+2012>2 mm up to 1 cm. This unit formed
the present-day land-surface over the western part of the quarry, where iron deposition on ped surfaces represents soil

development, although any higher profile had been incorporated into modern ploughsoil. Eastwards unit 5 was overlain
1
by desiccated peat of Holocene age, and thickened eastwards towards the former course of the river Idle and is interpreted
2
being part of the Hemingbrough Formation, deposited at depth into proglacial Lake Humber.

5 5.1. Plant Macrofossils
6
7 The raw sediment from Sample 2 was dominated by washed-together plant fragments (Table 2), in particular water-worn
8 twigs and it also contained numerous sclerotia of Cenococcum geophilum. Seeds and fruits were relatively well
9 preserved, however, Empetrum was only represented by endocarps and no leaves were found. Only a single tiny leaf of
10 Salix polaris was found. No caryopses of grasses were found and bryophytes were only represented by a few Sphagnum
11 leaves. The lack of such remains could be due to preservation, but it could also be due to hydrodynamic sorting in
12 flowing water. It is surprising that no moss remains were found, because mosses are important in Arctic plant communities.
13 Remains of mosses usually preserve well, and have been reported from a number of Middle Devensian (MIS3) sites in
14 Britain and elsewhere in north-western Europe (e.g. [56]). Again, this may be due to hydrodynamic sorting.
15 The most common fossil was Cenococcum geophilum; a fungus that lives in various soil types. Common presence of
16 sclerotia of this species is usually taken as an indication of soil erosion [57], but the light sclerotia may also have been
17 concentrated by flowing water. Remains of macrolimnophytes are rare in the fossil assemblage. Ranunculus sect.
18 Batrachium sp. is represented by a few achenes, and this plant usually grows along the shores of ponds or small lakes.
Submerged water plants comprise the charophyte Nitella sp. (1 oospore) and Stuckenia filiformis (2 endocarps). The
19
submerged taxa indicate small lakes with clear, oligotrophic water. The rarity of water plant remains indicates that ponds or
20
lakes were scarce in the area. Carex spp. may have grown in shallow water at lake or pond margins or in mires and
21
Sphagnum in bogs. Viola palustris is also a mire plant, and Selaginella selaginoides is found in bogs or other areas with
22 moist or wet soils.
23 Dwarf shrub heath communities are indicated by macrofossils of several species of dwarf shrubs. Endocarps of Arctous
24 alpina were common, which is surprising because there appears to be no previous fossil records of this species from
25 Britain [58,59]. A. alpina is a circumpolar low-arctic and boreal plant [60]. At the present day in the British Isles, it is
26 restricted to montane moorland in Scotland. Fossil endocarps of A. alpina have been reported for example from Eemian
27 deposits in Greenland [61] and Lateglacial deposits in southern Sweden and Denmark (e.g. [62,63]). The endocarps of A.
28 alpina are similar to, but flatter than those of Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, which has been reported from Middle Devensian
29 deposits in Britain [58]. Endocarps of Empetrum nigrum were also common. These are referred to E. nigrum and they may
30 come from E. nigrum subsp. hermaphroditum (Hagerup) Böcher. E. nigrum endocarps are rarely reported from Middle
31 Devensian deposits in Britain, but one endocarp was reported from Scotland by Bos et al. [59]. It has also, but rarely, been
32 reported from Middle Devensian deposits elsewhere in north-west Europe. Houmark-Nielsen et al. [64] found a single
33 endocarp of the species in a deposit in north-western Denmark. E. nigrum is a circumpolar plant, which has a wide
34 geographical range in the Arctic, but is also widespread in the temperate zone.
35 Betula nana is represented by three nutlets. There are numerous fossil records of this species from Britain, following the
36 first report by Heer [65], and its remains are common in Middle Devensian deposits [58]. B. nana is also a circumpolar
37 arctic and northern boreal plant, presently restricted in the UK to northern England and Scotland. The last woody plant
38 recovered was Salix polaris. It was represented by a tiny 1.4 mm long leaf. Although small, the margin was entire and
39 showed no signs of a crenation or serration as seen in S. herbacea. The sample also contained a few budscales and a small
40 twig with two budscales of Salix sp. S. polaris is one of the most cold-adapted of woody plants, and it has previously
41 been reported from several Middle Devensian deposits in England [66,58]. It is currently found in northern Europe
(including Svalbard), northern Asia and north western North America.
42
Herbaceous plants include Luzula cf. spicata, Potentilla cf. crantzii, Rumex acetosa and Silene suecica, which may have
43
grown in heaths. Epilobium sp. grow in heaths or in plant communities on wet or moist soil. Their seeds have not
44
previously been reported from Middle Devensian deposits in Britain according to Godwin [58]. Rumex acetosella is
45 indicative of dry sandy or gravelly soils with patches of open vegetation and Potentilla anserina is often found near the
46 shores of lakes, on bare ground or in grass-rich habitats; it can tolerate salt-rich soils.
47 In summary, the plant macrofossils suggest that the landscape was treeless tundra that supported widespread dwarf-shrub
48 heaths. Some of the recorded plants indicate base-rich soils, whereas indicate more acidic conditions. The flora indicate a
49 continuous snow cover in winter. Moisture conditions varied from dry and freely draining to wetland, pond or riparian.
50
51
52 5.2. Vertebrate remains
53 In 2005, a workman from the Finningley Quarry took two lengths of tusk, presumed to be of mammoth, and a scapula of
54 a bovid into Doncaster Museum [67]. He refused to leave the material and their subsequent fate is unknown, but he did
55 suggest that other bones had been found during quarrying. Howes (pers. comm.), who examined the material, has
56 suggested that bovid was either Bos primigenius, or steppe bison, Bison cf. priscus. It is unfortunate that it is not possible
57 to place the bones in the stratigraphy. However, the underlying ORG is completely decalcified and the overlying deposits
58 of the proglacial lake belong to a period when carrying capacity was too low to support any substantial vertebrate fauna,
59 so it is probable therefore that these relate to the MIS 3 deposits and some support for this is provided by the dung faunas
from the insect samples.
60
5.3. The Insect faunas
R. Soc. open sci. https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 6 of 39
5.3.1. Coleoptera
1 Two samples produced insect remains. The fauna from Sample 2 is more extensive than that from Sample 3, and includes
2 more species no longer found in Britain (cf. [68]); several have a present distribution which is essentially Siberian. The
3 fauna is dominated by a dung beetle, Aphodius (Chilothorax) jacobsoni, identified on heads, pronota and patterns of
4 maculae on the elytra. In his review of subgenus Chilothorax, however, Frolov [69] indicates that A. jacobsoni consists of
5 a complex of several closely related species, although none appears to occur west of eastern Kazakhstan, and southern
6 Siberia and the core distribution is Mongolian [70]; there appears to be little habitat data available. Other fossil records
7 are restricted to MIS 3 deposits at Queensford, on the Thames terraces in Oxfordshire, where it is the most common dung
8 beetle [71] and Coope (in [72]) also includes a possible identification from similar aged deposits at Sandy in
9 Bedfordshire.
10 Helophorus praenanus is recorded from grassy pools in eastern Siberia, Mongolia and southwards into northern China
11 [73,74]. The taxon was first identified as a fossil from Starunia, and Angus [73] also notes that it is a not infrequent
12 component of insect assemblages from the colder parts of glacials. There are MIS 3 records from Baston Fen, south
13 Lincolnshire [75], Earith, Cambridgeshire [76], Great Billing, Northamptonshire [77], Kempton Park, Surrey [78], Leeds,
West Yorkshire [79], Lechlade, Queensford and Standlake, Oxfordshire [71] and Whitemoor Haye, Staffordshire [80];
14
records from Kirby-on-Bain in Lincolnshire [81] have recently been re-assigned to MIS 6 [24]. The remainder of the
15
water beetle fauna also includes indicators of cold conditions, with the small dytiscids Hydroporus lapponum and H.
16
notabilis, no longer found in the British Isles, being restricted largely to above the treeline in Scandinavia [82], occurring
17 in ponds and shallow lakes. Both occur in the Lateglacial at St Bees in Cumbria [83], but only the latter has been found
18 on other MIS 3 sites, at Lechlade and Queensford [71] and Upton Warren, Worcestershire [84]. Whilst the ground beetle
19 Pelophila borealis would occur on the sandy margins of temporary pools on the floodplain [85], where the small rove
20 beetle Bledius arcticus would have burrowed [86], both the more abundant Notiophilus aquaticus and Amara quenseli
21 would have ranged more widely on sparsely vegetated sandy ground, where several of the rove beetles would have lived
22 in the litter under low herbage. Several of the latter, including Pycnoglypta lurida, Olophrum boreale, Eucnecosum
23 species, Acidota quadrata, Boreaphilus henningianus and Holoboreaphilus nordenskioldi are essentially arctic and
24 Siberian in distribution, frequent in litter beneath low willows; all are not infrequent MIS 3 fossils. H. nordenskioldi is
25 Holarctic, but only extends westwards as far as the Kanin Peninsula in Arctic Russia and is restricted to the tundra [87].
26 For the Nearctic, Morgan et al. [88] suggest an association with heavily disturbed ground over permafrost.
27 Utilising habitat traits from the classification in the BugsCEP database [89], the more extensive fauna from Sample 2
28 indicates a varied landscape with more or less equal indications of water, meadowland, wetland/marshes and
29 heathland/moorland. Both standing and running water are indicated, the former more robustly than the latter (figure 12).
30 There are few indications of the specific nature of the flora from the beetles. The weevils Otiorhynchus arcticus, O.
31 nodosus, O. rugifrons and Tropiphorus obtusus are essentially polyphagous on low vegetation, the larvae feeding on the
32 roots, whilst species of Notaris are oligophagous on waterside and aquatic sedges, grasses and reeds [90,91], on which the
33 small pollen beetle Kateretes pedicularis would also feed [92]. The remaining weevil, Baris cf. artemisiae, not currently
34 found in Britain, breeds in wormwood, Artemisia species [93]. Species of Phratora feed on willows and poplars, whilst
35 the ladybird Ceratomegilla ulkei is a predator on aphids on the taiga and tundra across the eastern Palaearctic and
36 Nearctic from Kazakhstan to Hudson Bay in eastern Canada [94]. It is known in fossil form from MIS 3 deposits at
Queensford [71], with earlier last glaciation records from Shropham in Norfolk [95] and Stanwick, Northamptonshire
37
[96]. The remaining indicators of flora are the two byrrhids, Simplocaria metallica and S. semistriata, which feed on
38
mosses [97,98]. The former is boreo-montane, not extending west of the Scandinavian mountains in Europe but known
39
from Greenland [97].
40 The identification of the alpine chrysomelid Oreina frigida is tentative because of the fragmented nature of the fossil.
41 [99] notes it as breeding in purple coltsfoot, Homogyne alpina, and Pasteels et al. [100] found an association of the
42 imagines with the umbellifer, Meum athemanticum.
43 The insect fauna from Sample 3 was sparse, relatively poorly preserved and there were few species (Table 3), of which
44 only Helophorus sibiricus provides significant ecological information. No longer found in the British Isles, it is a water
45 beetle associated with pools at the edge of snow melt and upland rivers [73,101], characteristic of the taiga but extending
46 into the tundra zone and southwards into montane temperate forest in the east. It has a broad Holarctic distribution,
47 ranging from the Scandinavian mountains eastwards across northern Russia and Siberia to Alaska and northern Canada,
48 west of the Mackenzie Delta [102]. A frequent and widespread fossil in Middle Devensian/Weichselian (MIS 3) and
49 Lateglacial deposits in the British Isles [89], it has the distinction of a fossil record extending back to the Miocene in
50 southern Siberia [102]. The scarabaeids in the sample include Aphodius borealis, a Holarctic dung beetle, which shows a
51 preference for elk (moose) dung in shaded localities [103], although it has also been recorded on dunes and in the
52 droppings of other large herbivores [104]. Aegialia sabuleti is found in plant litter on sandy river and stream banks [105].
53 Pittino [106] has recently described a new species, A. insularis as endemic to the British Isles, but this cannot be
54 separated from A. sabuleti on the fossil material. Whilst A. sabuleti (s.l.) is a not infrequent Quaternary fossil [89],
55 Aphodius borealis has only two other British fossil records, from MIS 3 deposits at Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire [81],
56 and from a Roman site in East Yorkshire (Buckland, unpubl.).
57 Overall, the picture is of a pond on a braided floodplain on sparsely vegetated sandy tundra, visited occasionally by larger
58 vertebrates.

1 5.3.2. Trait-based habitat reconstruction from the Coleoptera
2 A quantitative, habitat trait-based reconstruction of the environment represented by the fauna allows for a general
3 landscape model to be constructed, and comparison of the landscapes represented by the Coleoptera in the two samples
4 (figure 12).
5 Taxon occurrence data (i.e. assuming one individual per taxon) suggest a mixed landscape for Sample 2 with more or less
6 equal indications of water, meadowland, wetlands/marshes and heathland/moorland landscape components. Clear
7 indications of standing water are provided by five species of water beetle (see above), but the running water indication is
8 only provided by the Alder fly, Sialis sp., larvae (Megaloptera). Running water taxa are somewhat unreliable due to their
9 propensity to be carried with the current and deposited in the sediments of pools and lakes. The presence of shaded
10 environments is suggested by a number of taxa, mainly at the genus level (compare Fig 12 A and B), but only one taxon
11 is an obligate xylophage or arboreal feeder. The single specimen of Phratora sp. would most likely have fed on the leaves
12 of willow shrubs and the genus includes species common in arctic Scandinavia. The only potential woodland indication at
13 the species level is the somewhat eurytopic Simplocaria semistriatus, a moss feeder as likely to be found under stones as
in woodland.
14
Removing the poorly resolved identifications (i.e. not to species), which provide a less secure and more general
15
reconstruction, and weighting the reconstruction by numbers of individuals (MNI) (Fig 12 B), focusses the picture to a
16
pond in a less diverse, open landscape, with sparse vegetation of wetland and moorland character.
17 In the quantitative reconstruction, Sample 3 appears somewhat similar to Sample 2, with the exception of less prominent
18 aquatic habitats and more disturbed ground (both wet and dry) in the former. The paucity of this fauna precludes the use
19 of abundance weighting or only taxa identified to species, but the indications of disturbance and wet and dry habitats
20 could fit with a braided river system. Evidence for grazing animals is potentially found in both samples, more so in
21 Sample 2, but this could be a reflection of the better quality of the data in the latter.
22
23 5.3.3. Trichoptera (Caddis flies)
24
25 Sample 2 from Finningley contains preserved frontoclypeal, pro- and meso-notal sclerites from larvae of cased caddisflies
26 (Order Trichoptera), and is made up of species from the families Phryganeidae, Apataniidae, Limnephilidae and
Molannidae. As aquatic larvae, caddis flies can be found in habitats ranging from fast-flowing rivers to temporary field
27
ponds. Assemblages of taxa from palaeo-deposits can offer a means of palaeoenvironmental reconstruction [107].
28
The most abundant and diverse taxa in the Finningley sample are from the Limnephilidae, (Table 4) and these indicate a
29
varied habitat with riverine and lake-edge species: Ecclisopteryx dalecarlica has larval cases made of mineral particles;
30 together with Anabolia cf nervosa, Limnephilus stigma and L. subcentralis, is found in slow-flowing sections of river
31 edges, and also from more permanent shallow pools, ponds and lakes. Grammotaulius spp., Limnephilus algosus and
32 L.picturatus have cases constructed of plant fragments. The cold-adapted family Apataniidae is also represented and
33 Apatania spp. are found in stony and gravel-bed brooks, rivers and lakes; the larval case is made of mineral particles.
34 Molanna albicans (Molannidae) is found in slow-flowing rivers and small upland lakes, building a case also of mineral
35 grains, and Agrypnia picta (Phryganeidae) is a species of permanent ponds and mires, constructing a case of large
36 fragments of plant material, e.g. Carex spp. [108,109].
37 Of special interest is the species Limnephilus algosus (McLachlan, 1868), a cased larva found amongst submerged
38 vegetation in permanent shallow pools, ponds, lakes, slow-flowing brooks and rivers [110,111,109]. To date there are no
39 fossil records of this species in the UK but reference is made to this species, described as Limnephilidae indet., in papers
40 published in Greenwood et al. [107]; Whittington et al. [112] and Schreve et al. [80], which can now be recorded as
41 Limnephilus algosus. Figure 13 shows the frontoclypeal apotome from both modern and fossil material of this species; its
42 colour pattern, shape, micro-sculpture and size are useful characters for identification. This species is recorded in
43 sediments in the UK ranging from 41<U+2012>43 cal yr BP at Whitemoor Haye, River Tame, Staffordshire [80], to
44 15,793<U+2012>13,306 cal a BP., Clettnadal, Shetland [112], and to 13,817<U+2012>13,543 cal a BP (CALIB 3.0) from Hemington, River
45 Trent, Nottinghamshire [107].
46 A map of present distribution (figure 14) shows Limnephilus algosus to be widely distributed in the western Palaearctic.
47 In Europe it is present in areas of high altitude and/or latitude and is described as a cold stenotherm of the alpine and sub
48 alpine zones [52]. It is found in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia (European Russia, Siberia and in the Russian Far East),
49 Germany (Bavaria), Austria (Tyrol and Oberösterreich), Switzerland, Czech Republic (Bohemia) and Slovakia
[113,114,115]. The circumpolar nature of this species distribution was highlighted by Nimmo [116] in a publication that
50
described a new species of Limnephilus from the Northwest Territories, Canada; this he named L. innuitorum, after the
51
Inuit people of the Canadian and Greenlandic Arctic. Later Nimmo et al. [117] also recorded L. innuitorum from
52
Chukotka in the Russian Far East. Grigorenko [118] then recognised that both descriptions matched, making innuitorum a
53 synonym of algosus (Ivanov 2011) [113].
54 Overall, the larval caddis assemblage suggests a cold, arctic equivalent environment that is primarily one of slow-flowing
55 streams and standing water (ponds and lakes) with occasional channels with moderate to fast flows.
56
57
58
5.3.4. Diptera
59 The fly assemblage from the site consists entirely of puparial fragments and is badly preserved and fragmented. One of
60 the specimens included anal spiracles which made identification possible, but in other cases the small fragments became
more fragmented whilst handling. Two of the taxa belonged to Anthomyiidae, a family of leaf and stem miners. Delia cf.
fabricii is a species associated with smooth meadow grass, Poa pratensis [119]. The larvae pupate in the soil in the
beginning of June and the adults emerge mid-summer [120]. Botanophila sp. belongs to another group of stem borers,

although some species are associated with fungi. A fragment of a calliphorid puparium, probably associated with either
carrion or dung, was also recovered but identification to species level was not possible. Although information from the
1
dipterous assemblage is limited, the environmental information points to a grassland environment.
2
3 5.4. Chronology
4 The Empetrum endocarps (crowberry) sample from the organic lens within the channel (unit 2) provided a radiocarbon
5 age of 37,057 ± 457 14C years BP (UBA-33853). This corresponds to 40,314 - 39,552 cal. years BP, using the INTCAL13
6 data set [121].
7
8 The remaining ages both on the channel and other units are based on the OSL results (figure 15 & Table 1). Sample Fin 1
9 (Shfd02010) from unit 2, and above the radiocarbon sample, gave an age of 35.7±2.0 ka corresponding closely to the
10 radiocarbon date from this unit. Sample Fin 2 (Shfd02011) from the lower part of unit 4 beneath the clay gave an age of
11 23.4±1.5 ka. Sample Fin 3 (Shfd02012) from above the clay in unit 4 gave an age of 19.2±1.1 ka.
12
13 From these results it is clear that unit 1 is older than 35.7±2.0 ka and unit 2 dates to between 39.9±0.4 to 35.7±2.0 ka BP.
14 This corresponds to MIS 3 [122] and to between Greenland Stadial 9 (GS-9) through to Greenland Stadial 7 (GS-7)
15 encompassing the interstadials of GI-8 [6]. Unit 3 lies between 35.7±2.0 ka and 23.4±1.5 ka (MIS 3/2). Unit 4 dates to
16 between 23.4±1.5 ka and sometime after 19.2±1.1 ka (MIS 2) and Greenland Stadial 2 (GS-2; [6]). Unit 5 is younger than
17 19.2±1.1ka.
18
19 5.5. Palaeoclimate
20
21
22
5.5.1. Periglacial structures and climate
23 Ice-wedge pseudomorphs within the sand and gravel of unit 1 indicate the former occurrence of permafrost, and their
24 intraformational nature implies that permafrost was broadly contemporaneous with sediment deposition. Their occurrence
25 within aggradations of braided river deposits is commonly taken to indicate that ice wedges developed in inactive parts of
26 the floodplain; such wedges may have thawed due to lateral migration of river channels or water ponding or flowing in
27 troughs overlying ice wedges [123]. The former presence of permafrost during deposition of unit 1 discounts an
interglacial or interstadial environment for gravel deposition. Instead, the gravel was deposited under a cold-stage
28
(permafrost) environment.
29
Involutions present within the gravel may relate to some form of periglacial disturbance (e.g. differential frost heave), but
30
it is difficult to be more specific about genesis or climatic significance in this instance because involutions in gravel are
31 often difficult to interpret.
32
33
34 5.5.2. Beetle-based climate reconstruction
35 A palaeo-temperature reconstruction was undertaken (Finningley paleo in figure 16 and supplementary data) using the
36 Mutual Climatic Range (MCR) method [124] as implemented in the BugsCEP software [125]. The MCR method
37 reconstructs the thermal environment in which the largest proportion of species in a sample could survive, using their
38 modern and historical ranges for reference. It allows for the calculation of TMax – mean temperature of the warmest
39 month, TMin – mean temperature of the coldest month, and TRange – difference between TMax and TMin and
40 essentially an indication of continentality. A higher TRange suggests a more continental climate, with larger differences
41 between summer and winter temperatures. Although previous publications have derived means and errors, or otherwise
indicated mid-points for reconstructed ranges, these have been shown to be mathematically incorrect [125,126] and are
42
thus not used here. Coleoptera over-winter as a range of different stages (egg, larval instars and/or adult, pupa), many
43
Arctic taxa surviving a wide variety of winter conditions in diapause [87], and there are a number of winter active species
44
reliant on snow cover [127]. However, wherever snow thickness is a few tens of centimetres or more, as is common
45 where shrubs trap snow, Coleoptera (or anything else) over-wintering or active at or near the land surface (i.e. beneath the
46 snow) will not provide a good indication of air temperature. Winter temperature reconstructions from any organism with
47 restricted winter activity are thus inherently less constrained than summer temperatures, as is reflected in the
48 reconstructions in figure 16, and calibration data for more extreme (hot or cold) temperatures in the BugsCEP software
49 are limited [125].
50 Sample 3 provides an MCR reconstruction from only three species (Notiophilus aquaticus, Helophorus sibiricus and
51 Aegialia sabuleti) of 8–14°C TMax and -22 to -2 TMin. This reconstruction is essentially constrained by the upper TMax
52 and lower TRange limits of H. sibiricus, and the lower TMax and upper TRange limits of A. sabuleti; the thermal
53 envelope for N. aquaticus is too poorly defined to be of use in defining the limits, but provides an additional species
54 supporting the reconstructed temperatures. The reconstructed temperatures are compared to the modern climate at
55 Finningley (1981–2010) (Table 5) as calculated from the Climate, Hydrology and Ecology research Support System
56 (CHESS) [128]. Sample 3 suggests that the climate at that time was considerably colder than the present day, and neither
57 this nor the temperatures reconstructed from Sample 2 overlap the equivalent values for the present, warmer climate.
58 Although Sample 2 provides at a glance similarly cold, but apparently more refined thermal reconstruction of 12–13°C,
59 this represents an overlap of the thermal envelopes of only 21 (87.5 %) of the 24 MCR species used in the reconstruction.
60 Among the species most acutely responsible for the incomplete overlap are water beetles of the Helophorus genus.
Regarded as a pioneer species frequenting temporary pools, H. grandis is scarce north of southern Scandinavia [101], and
appears to be restricted to relatively warm (TMax >11°C), oceanic climates. H. praenanus, on the other hand, appears to

9
be able to cope with the variation between the extreme cold winters and mild summers of Eastern Siberia. The third
1
species which just fails to intersect the area of maximum overlap, is the rove beetle Holoboreaphilus nordenskioeldi,
2
known only from areas with summers which get no warmer than 11°C. Whilst there are undoubtedly improvements to be
3
made in the primary MCR calibration data, especially for more continental species, the envelope for Helophorus grandis
4 is reasonably well resolved for its colder summer limits. The thermal limits to the distribution of H. praenanus and
5 Holoboreaphilus nordenskioeldi, on the other hand, are poorly mapped and it could be that they overlap more than has
6 been recorded. The same may apply to the eastern Palaearctic dung beetle, Aphodius jacobsoni and other important
7 species, such as the ladybird Ceratomegilla ulkei, yet to be included in the MCR calibration data, and thus not
8 contributing to the reconstruction. Considering the extensive fossil record of H. grandis [89], and the difficulty of
9 separating species in this group on the fossil parts, there is also the possibility that the fossil record includes both colder
10 and warmer subspecies which have yet to be defined.
11
12 6. 6. Discussion
13
14
6.1. Comparison of MIS 3 beetle-based climate
15 reconstructions
16 Lemdahl and Coope [129] summarise the MCR results from insect faunas from Late Pleistocene sites in Europe, whilst
17 Coope (2001) [28] in a more detailed examination of MIS 3 insect faunas concludes that, when correlated with the
18 Greenland ice-core data, the preserved assemblages reflected the warmer episodes and that carrying capacity during the
19 colder episodes was such that there were no associated organic sediments. It is debateable, however, whether the data are
20 sufficiently robust to support this interpretation. Several of the older dates lay close to the limits of radiocarbon dating
21 and should be treated as minima, others are bulk sample dates, and the association between dated context and insect
22 faunas in others is less than secure (see supplemental data). The MIS 3 sample is further reduced by the number of
23 species for which climate-space envelopes are available. Figure 16 provides beetle-based MCR summer (TMax)
24 reconstructions for the majority of insect samples from MIS 3 sites in England (42 samples from radiocarbon dated sites
25 with >2 MCR species, see supplementary data for detail). The majority of summer temperatures lie between 9 and 11 °C,
26 which overlaps with the range of Sample 3 from Finningley (8–14°C), but is slightly lower than that of Sample 2 (12–
27 13°C), the latter being based on more species and thus a more reliable reconstruction. The Finningley fauna most likely
28 represents a cold stadial with both summers and winters slightly warmer than the climates indicated by the majority of the
29 other MIS 3 samples. At least superficially, the climate is most similar to the temperature reconstruction based on the
30 much larger, similarly dated fauna from Queensford near Dorchester on Thames: (44,491–39,400 cal a BP).
31 This interpretation fits with the Finningley floral list, although this is more limited than from some other Middle
32 Devensian sites in England. This is partly because it lacks southern, thermophilous elements, such as Najas flexilis,
Lycopus europaeus, Groenlandia densa and Scirpus lacustris, which were found in the Middle Devensian flora at Earith
33
locality 7 [130,66]. The occurrence of floral southern elements at some sites may reflect that the climate during MIS 3
34
was extremely unstable, alternating rapidly between cold stadials and warmer interstadials. Coope [76] showed that part
35
of the plant remains from Earith came from a cold and continental episode, and another part came from a temperate and
36 more oceanic episode. It is also possible that some remains of southern plants at British sites are reworked from layers
37 deposited during warmer intervals. Due to the problems with dating close to the limits of radiocarbon, it is also possible
38 that some deposits referred to the Middle Devensian in earlier publications are significantly older.
39 With the exception of a small number of samples showing very well constrained, and extremely cold (-27 to -23°C)
40 winter temperature reconstructions, in particular North Lechlade, samples S4 and S5 from Baston Fen and E9 from
41 Earith, the TMin values for Finningley agree with colder samples from other sites. Although ten of the MIS 3 samples
42 intersect the range of summer temperatures measured at Finningley between 1981 and 2010, only four of the
43 corresponding winter reconstructions intersect the modern winter temperature range. Although the winter reconstructions
44 are less well constrained, this could be tentatively interpreted as indicating that the interstadial climates represented in
45 these samples were significantly more continental than the present day, something which simple modern distribution data
46 for several of the taxa would also suggest.
47 The MCR results for Baston Fen (insect sample AMS dates of 36,606–31,859 cal a BP) generally indicate summer and
48 winter temperatures much colder than present day, and colder than or overlapping the Finningley reconstruction. Baston
49 Fen’s mostly high TRange values (supplementary data) also suggest climates that are more continental throughout the
50 site’s range of dates. Baston S4 and S5, whilst showing cold summers, indicate significantly colder winters than most of
51 the other MIS 3 samples, and at least 1°C and up to 20°C colder than Finningley. Two samples from this site (S3 and S6)
52 suggest warmer summer conditions, equivalent to the lower range of present day Finningley, but with overlapping winter
53 temperatures implying a highly continental climate with cool summers and extremely cold winters for at least part of MIS
54 3.
55 Samples from Four Ashes (>50,000 to 33,570 cal a BP) and Earith (> 50,000 to 43,168 cal a BP) provide reconstructions
both at the colder end of Finningley’s summers, including potentially colder winters (Four Ashes S3 and S45, Earith E4
56
and E9), but also summer temperatures within the lower span of modern variation. On the basis of the insects, these sites
57
clearly cover both stadial and interstadial deposits, which are most likely to record colder and warmer conditions than
58
Finningley, respectively. Interestingly, they also suggest periods of more oceanic climate, with less variation between
59 summer and winter. The two small MCR faunas from Kempton Park (40,304 to 39,288 cal a BP) provide similar
60 evidence, as do the two samples from Upton Warren (47,802 to 43,023 cal a BP, but see notes in supplemental data).
MCR reconstructions from the beetles at Great Billing (33,069–31,348 cal a BP) are equally cold or colder than the
Finningley fossils, with comparable summers and winters. Whilst Finningley overlaps with the reconstructed temperature

regimes of the single sample MIS 3 sites at Leeds Oxbow (46,966–40,569 cal a BP), Sandy (39,439–32,296 cal a BP) and
the abundant fauna at Queensford. The younger fauna from North Lechlade (34,586–30,886 cal a BP) suggests
1
significantly colder winters (-27 to -23°C), and this contrasts with the slightly warmer winters (-12 to -10° C) indicated
2
by the significant fauna from Standlake (33,975–32,673 cal a BP).
3
Whilst Standlake and North Lechlade provide well-refined winter reconstructions above and below Finningley, the
4 majority of samples from Tattershall Castle (>50,000 to 43,499 cal a BP) and Whitemoor Haye (47,084 to 44,391 cal a
5 BP) provide winter reconstructions which overlap the entire range of values. These sites all indicate similar summer
6 temperatures, almost entirely lower than Finningley sample two (with the exception of Whitemoor Haye S6/7, which
7 overlaps the range of values from the Finningley sample). Upton Warren, although initially similarly dated to the latter
8 two sites but considered older by Coope ([131]; but see [18]; [20]), produces MCR reconstructions which tend towards
9 present-day summer temperatures, and potentially slightly warmer winter temperatures than these sites. These values are
10 similar to the possibly interstadial and warmer samples described for Baston Fen, Earith and Four Ashes, and several
11 degrees warmer than Finningley.
12 In summary, the MCR reconstructions from Finningley are thought to record cold stadial conditions, but with milder
13 summers and winters than those inferred from many other English beetle faunas dated to MIS 3. The overall MIS 3 beetle
14 dataset from England indicates substantial variation in summer and winter climate during this interval (~59–28 ka),
15 consistent with independent evidence for substantial stadial–interstadial climate variability obtained from the Greenland
16 ice-core record [132,6]. In view of the millennial timescales of such variability and the uncertainties of dating terrestrial
17 sites at or near the limit of radiocarbon, it is clear the correlations even between terrestrial MIS 3 sites in England are
18 challenging, and terrestial-ice-core correlations remain speculative. Coope’s [133] comment that episodes of gravel
19 deposition in many sequences may reflect even colder conditions when carrying capacity was reduced such that there was
20 little contemporary biota remains valid.
21
22
23
6.2. Periglacial and proglacial lake environments
Evidence for periglaciation at Finningley is broadly consistent with that from other lowland regions of England and the
24 near-continent. The Finningley sequence records a change from permafrost conditions associated with deposition of the
25 basal unit of sand and gravel to milder periglacial conditions during deposition of the overlying infilled channel.
26 Wedge structures similar to those in the basal unit have been reported from gravelly sequences of Pleistocene age in
27 lowland England (see reviews in [134. p.53–63]; [123]). But the exact age of the gravel and wedges at Finningley is
28 uncertain, precluding correlation with the British periglacial record. A minimum age is provided by the calibrated
29 radiocarbon age of 39,933±381 cal. years BP from the overlying organic silt, but this study provides no maximum age.
30 Thus, gravel deposition during permafrost conditions may have occurred during, for example, a MIS 3 stadial before ~40
31 ka or cold-climate conditions of MIS 4 or 6. Interestingly, there are similarities in terms of relatively small wedge size,
32 intraformational nature and host stratified gravels with wedges and gravel of facies assemblage 1 at Baston, Lincolnshire,
33 which have been dated by radiocarbon and OSL to the Middle Devensian [75]. If the wedges and gravel at Finningley are
34 from a Middle Devensian stadial, one possibility is the Hasselo Stadial, when permafrost is known to have developed—
35 inferred partly from ice-wedge pseudomorphs—in the Netherlands. The Hasselo Stadial has provided radiocarbon ages of
36 43,220<U+2012>42,290 cal. BP [135]. These authors suggested that the subsequent Hengelo Interstadial (42,350<U+2012>41,380 cal. BP)
37 caused permafrost degradation and formation of involutions.
38 The sand and organic silt with a depositional age of ~40–35 ka infilling the river channel at Finningley are of similar age
39 and environmental context to many Middle Devensian periglacial river deposits in lowland England (reviewed in [136, p.
40 162<U+2012>171]; [134, p.58<U+2012>61]; [19, p.452]). Contemporary rivers in lowland England were mainly of braided type and
41 deposited gravel as a result of the supply of abundant coarse sediment from mass wasting on adjacent hillslopes [137]. A
highly variable nival discharge regime favoured reworking of solifluction deposits during snowmelt floods, winnowing
42
out the fine-grained sediment and leaving behind the gravel. Finer deposits exposed on floodplains and eroded from pre-
43
existing deposits were vulnerable to reworking by wind and water, which deposited sediments such as coversand by wind
44
action (e.g. [11]) and laminated silt and sand by aeolian rainout and sheetwash [138]. Palaeoecological evidence
45 associated with the Middle Devensian river gravels in eastern England [139,75] indicates wetter conditions at the time of
46 gravel deposition and hence more active river systems than those during the LGM. In summary, Middle Devensian
47 periglacial environments, at least in southeast and eastern England, are thought to have been warmer and wetter than the
48 cold and arid conditions of the Early and Late Devensian.
49 Both units 4 and 5 are interpreted as indicating the presence in the Finningley area of Lake Humber. The coarser sands
50 and gravels of unit 4 are taken to indicate that in the period 23.4±1.5 ka to 19.2±1.1 ka Finningley was close to the
51 margins of this lake. Unit 5 is interpreted as indicating deeper water at Finningley occurred sometime after 19.2 ±1.1 ka.
52 Such ages are not out of line with those presented from wave-rippled silty sand at Hemingbrough by Murton et al. [37],
53 or the basal age Bateman et al. [39] reported from laminated clays from Lake Humber. Given that ice had to block the
54 Humber Gap for Lake Humber to form, this also indicates the movement of the North Sea Ice lobe on-shore at this time,
55 something confirmed by recent glacial ages from Ferriby [40]. The low-lying nature of the Finningley site cannot add
56 information as to the absolute lake levels as the sediments themselves occur at between 6 and 8 m OD. However, the
57 switch from units 4 to 5 may indicate that an earlier, lower and more fluctuating Lake Humber preceded the more
58 widespread and deeper Lake Humber associated with the laminated clays.

11
The new work shows that the Finningley sequence records a change from permafrost conditions to milder periglacial
1
conditions during deposition of the infilled channel. Unit 1, at the base, is tentatively correlated with the ORG of Gaunt
2
[22], and may represent more than one glacial–interglacial cycle. The organic silt in Unit 2 dated to 40,314 - 39,552 cal a
3
BP (MIS 3) contains Arctic flora and fauna indicative of deposition in a cold, continental arctic regime. The mean
4 temperature of the warmest month is reconstructed—from beetle-based MCR data—as 8 to 14°C and, with less certainty,
5 that of the coldest month as -22 to -2°C . The channel is sealed by a diamict (Unit 3) derived from a low ridge of
6 glaciofluvial deposits to the west. Unit 4, largely thin bedded sands with some clay–silts, is the equivalent of Gaunt’s [22]
7 Littoral Sands and Gravels. Unit 5, beneath largely desiccated Holocene peat, consists of the laminated clay–silts of the
8 Hemingbrough Formation, deposited at depth into the proglacial Lake Humber during the LGM.
9 Overall MIS 3 in England between 59-28 ka appears to have had substantial variation in summer and winter climate. This
10 is consistent with the Greenland ice-core record. Comparison of this new proxy data from the temporally well constrained
11 Finningley site with other MIS 3 records in England suggests around 40 ka was a prominent cold stadial. However
12 difficulties of dating and correlation of most MIS 3 sites within England makes it challenging to correlate with certainty
13 to the Greenland ice-core record. At present the stadial could be correlated with any of the Greenland Stadials between 7
14 to 11.

6 Figure 12. Beetle habitat trait-based environmental reconstruction using A) taxon occurrence only and B) species level
7 abundance weighted data. A) provides a general reconstruction, giving equal weight to each taxon, based on the habitat
8 preferences at all taxonomic resolutions; B) uses only taxa identified to species and weights the reconstruction according
9 to the number of individuals found, thus providing a more constrained reconstruction for the most reliable habitat
10 indications whilst ignoring evidence from poorly resolved identifications. Neither reconstruction is ‘correct’, but together
11 they provide a tool for interpreting the environmental implications of the fauna. Note that a taxon may be included in
12 more than one habitat class. MNI = Minimum Number of Individuals. (See [125] for classification and methodology, [89]
13 for classification data).

20 Figure 16. Beetle-based MCR reconstruction of the Finningley samples compared with other radiocarbon dated MIS 3
21 sites mentioned in the text. Modern Finningley climate is shown for comparison (leftmost bar and horizontal shaded
22 areas). Samples with <3 MCR species have been omitted but samples with poor maximum species overlaps (<80%) have
23 been included to provide more samples for comparison. The lower bar chart shows the number of species used in each
reconstruction. Sample names are as stored in the BugsCEP database (Buckland & Buckland 2006) [89]. Site ages, in
24
calibrated ka BP, are given for either the range of dated insect samples or the overall site where these are not directly
25
dated (see supplemental data). The figure therefore does not represent a contiguous sequence. Dates calibrated with
26
OxCal [140] using the IntCal 13 curve [141]. For sources and primary data, see Supplementary Table 1.

29 stratigraphic position, see figure 6).

34 NSPEC is the number of species in the sample with climate (MCR) data; overlap is the maximum percentage of these
35 species with overlapping thermal envelopes, i.e. the area of climate space with maximum overlap. An ideal overlap is
36 100%, but large faunas or samples too coarse to resolve changing climates produce lower overlaps. Calculations using
37 BugsCEP [89].

36 dated MIS 3 sites mentioned in the text. Modern Finningley climate is shown for comparison (leftmost bar
37 and horizontal shaded areas). Samples with <3 MCR species have been omitted but samples with poor
38 maximum species overlaps (<80%) have been included to provide more samples for comparison. The lower
39 bar chart shows the number of species used in each reconstruction. Sample names are as stored in the
40 BugsCEP database (Buckland & Buckland 2006) [89]. Site ages, in calibrated ka BP, are given for either the
range of dated insect samples or the overall site where these are not directly dated (see supplemental data).
41 The figure therefore does not represent a contiguous sequence. Dates calibrated with OxCal [140] using the
42 IntCal 13 curve [141]. For sources and primary data, see Supplementary Table 1.

Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
This is basically a good paper that adds significantly to the corpus of data concerning the age and
environment of deposition of the Older River Gravels, which are an important unit in the Middle to
Late Pleistocene regional development of GB. My comments are all very minor and perhaps more
food for thought. They are annotated on the attached manuscript.
Response to reviewer 1:
Thank you for your kind remarks and please see revisions in the annotated version of the
manuscript. We have attempted to accommodate most of your suggestions.

Comments by Dr Ian S. Evans, Durham University, on Buckland et al., Mid to Late Devensian
landscape change in England.
A thorough analysis of stratigraphic and palaeontological/palaeoecological observations from this
important site in eastern England is provided by a group of experienced scientists. Observations
over a number of years as the quarry face progressed improve the reliability of interpretations. The
numerous illustrations are well drawn and relevant: the photos are well selected.
The section 6.1 Discussion usefully compares the temperature ranges (summer and winter) implied
at Finningley with those from other MIS 3 sites. Using the Greenland record, the authors correctly
state that interstadials and stadials alternated within MIS 3, yet it is difficult to follow the
implications of the various dates and temperatures in the text which (despite the conclusion) reads
as if there is some expectation of uniform conditions throughout MIS 3. The dates tabulated below
Fig. 16 do not put things into chronological order.
Authors’ response: The sites are in order of youngest date, which is unfortunately as good a
chronological order as the sample data permits (but see below)…
Section 6.1 would be aided by a summary temperature: chronology Figure plotting each observation
as a box, with its range of calibrated dates and its range of Tmin and (separately) Tmax. (There are
13 date ranges mentioned in the text, i.e. 13 boxes.) The text could then be shortened and clarified.
Authors’ response: This is something we have discussed back and forth repeatedly. Whilst we agree
that this would be useful, the data are simply not yet good enough to allow the MCR results for
individual samples to be placed at their correct point in a timeline (hence the use of site date ranges
in figure 16). We have compromised by including an additional supplemental figure 3 which shows
the site date ranges (calibrated 14C only) compared with the Greenland Ice core data.
In terms of adding MCR data to the new figure, the entomologists amongst us are adamant that this
should not be done due to the limited and variable reliability of the dates for individual samples.
Leaving out poorly/un-dated samples would give a misleading impression of the variability of
climates at each site. Inserting these samples into a figure with the Greenland curve would give a
false indication of accuracy, and just using the min-max values for Tmax/Tmin would remove
indications of less variable climates. Leaving off Tmin simplifies, but removes the continentality
(difference Tmax-Tmin) aspect of the story, which is very interesting and something for a later paper.
I think the title could be improved: it does not cover England and there is little on Late Devensian. I
suggest ‘Mid Devensian climate and landscape in eastern England’ would be more accurate as the
first sentence of the title.
Authors’ response: A compromise is suggested, as we feel the results do have implications for a
wider geographical region (see commented text).
Readers are expected to be familiar with detailed terminology in several fields: sedimentology,
botany and zoology. Possibly terms such as ‘flaser’ and ‘stenotherm’ might be defined.
- Flaser clarified on first use
- ‘stenotherm’ clarified
Below I suggest a number of corrections and some cases where the expression can be polished.
There is a tendency to use too many commas, making complicated sentences with too many
qualifications:
- Acknowledged, and we have attempted to follow the reviewer's suggestion to help improve
readability
some could be split, e.g.
lines 18-22
- split sentence
and 30-33 on page 6.
- split sentence
DETAILS:
Page 1: Line 39 ‘seek to’ is anthropomorphic. ‘data can …’?
- Corrected
52 drop one of the 2 boths
- Corrected
55 perhaps ‘Britain’ (or even ‘England’) rather than UK?
- Our use of the UK as a geographical boundary is intentional. We do not cover Ireland, but refer to
England, Scotland and include references on Wales.
Page 2: Line 1 ‘showed’
- Corrected
2 ‘the limit’
- Not corrected.
18 ‘setting, in’
- Corrected.
34 ‘deep-water’ rather than profundal
- included both, to promote the continued use of scientific terminology
41 ‘from both’
- Corrected.
43 delete comma
- sentence changed
Page 3: 13 ‘were collected’
- sentence changed
13-14 delete present commas: insert comma before ‘and’.
- sentence changed
14 ‘was revealed’
- Corrected.
18 ‘was placed’
- Corrected.
20 delete second ‘then’
- Corrected.
25 ‘that for’
- adjusted
29 Should Stratigraphy be section 5.1? – and later sections renumbered.
- Yes, corrected.
31 delete first comma
- not corrected
49 delete first comma
- not corrected
Page 4: 21 ‘which are interpreted’
- corrected
Page 5: 2 ‘river Idle. It is interpreted as being ’
- sentence restructured to avoid confusion
11 ‘non-preservation’ !
- added 'poor'
48 ‘whereas others indicate’
- Corrected.
Page 6: 5.3.1 is italicised, unlike any later subsection headings…
- Corrected. Had issues with the template!
2 ‘:’ rather than ‘;’
- I disagree! But have split the sentence anyway.
6 ‘appear’
- Corrected.
16 One comma too many! Delete last, ‘[82] and occurring’.
- Corrected.
26 ‘suggested’
- Corrected.
41 Give name before [99] ?
- Corrected.
Page 7: 28 remove comma. Split the following sentence?
- moved comma and split following sentence for clarity.
30 ‘it is found’
- sentence rewritten
39 delete last comma
- not corrected
39-40 “in papers published in” makes no sense, as the three following citations are normal papers,
not collections.
- corrected
40 replace ‘;’ with ’,’
- corrected
44 ‘BP at Clettnadal’
- corrected
54 ‘arctic-equivalent’
- corrected
Page 8: 13 ‘between … and’
- corrected
58 ‘glance a similarly’
- corrected
Page 9: 11 6. Not 6.6.
- corrected
16-17 past tense, especially for 2001 !
- corrected, sad but true.
56 summer-winter-summer?? Rewrite sentence.
- rewritten
Page 10: 1 The sentence ending ‘Queensford.’ is a non-sentence. It should be combined with the
following, or re-written.
- rewritten (removed the initial 'Whilst')
8: Replace second ‘;’ with ‘and’.
- removed first comma and replaced second with comma, as 'and' would change the referencing
This is another clumsy sentence.
- split the sentence for readability
24: ‘near continent’
- corrected
39/40 ‘;’ or ‘,’ ?
- corrected '.'
Page 11: top – excess ‘11’
- page number in template, I dare not touch it...
11 ‘suggests that around’
- corrected
14 ‘and 11’
- corrected
Page 14: 26-27 Why is ‘Published for the Quaternary Research Association’ stated here? It is not
stated elsewhere JQS is cited. Also, italicise journal title.
- corrected
