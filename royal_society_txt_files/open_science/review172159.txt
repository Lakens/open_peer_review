This article presents a new methodological tool for social network analysis that draws on
foundational social theory (structural balance theory), illustrated with a clear (if complicated)
example, which itself has novel findings. The article is generally clearly written and well laid out.
It makes an empirical contribution with its example of inter-individual and inter-household
relationships in an indigenous Nicaraguan community. The contribution of the empirical and
theoretical findings are primarily to the field of human behavioral ecology, but the author makes
a convincing argument that the methods developed here will be widely applicable beyond this
particular field. The paper starts with the fundamental observation that individuals are often
members of nested groups, with the residential/sharing unit being a particularly salient
grouping of individuals who have a particularly strong shared interest in each others' well being.
Koster notes that members of such residential units may be particularly compelled to resolve any
unbalanced triadic relationships, and to do so in a way which maintains positive relationships
with household members. This then leads to the presentation of a mixed model that can account
both for relationships between individuals, as well as relationships between households, and
combinations thereof. The value of this model, and its consideration of larger social structure, is
made clear through the analysis of the support relationships within an indigenous Nicaraguan
community. It both identifies locally meaningful (and intriguing) patterns (e.g., that infidelity can
3
dampen relationships between households, in accordance with structural balance theory), and
also has important insights for the large literature on relatedness and exchange within
anthropology (both the general finding of these the importance of these interaction terms and the
hierarchical effects, and novel concepts such as affinal relatedness).
I have two primary recommendations for the improvement of the paper. The first is an issue of
terminology. Throughout the paper, the author uses a set of terms to mean broadly the same
thing: group, unit, and household. This fluidity in terms often leads to a lack of clarity in the
writing. For example, it is not immediately obvious what "group," "inter-group," or "group-level"
should be referring to. In practice, they generally seem to be referring to households and inter-
household relationships, but you could easily forgive a reader for taking "group" to be a term for
the entire community, rather than this more local association, sometimes called, as I say, a
household or a residential unit. Greater consistency in terms, or at very least a statement at the
start that defines these terms in the context of the paper would greatly help the reader.
Second, this is a paper that aims to do a good deal -- introduce a novel model, make theoretical
contributions to multiple fields, and present significant findings of an application of this model.
Streamlining the paper somewhat would help facilitate all of these tasks. Most notably, shifting
some of the presentation of the model (e.g., the many terms on page 7) to supplementary
materials would let the focus be on the broad contributions of the model to methods and theory,
without unnecessarily bogging down the reader. A simplified presentation of the main features
of the model, with a more elaborated presentation in the supplementary materials, would make
for a more compelling paper.
I similarly wonder why the models presented were quite as complex as they were, given that
some terms were found to have little effect (e.g., the BMI and skin color measures). Again, given
the many tasks that this article is attempting, it seems like a better solution might be simpler
models with fewer terms, and a note that other variables (such as BMI and skin color) were
considered but excluded (presumably they can't be helping model fit, if their effects are as
negligible as reported). A slightly simpler model would still present the value of the technique,
without distracting the reader from the main findings.
Finally, a recommendation to the author, but one which should not, I think, influence the decision
to publish this article in RS Open Science. The author clearly is trying to make the case that others
should use the Group-Structured Social Relations Model. He does indeed include the data files
and R code to replicate his particular set of models, but any push to really facilitate the adoption
of this model would really require a more user-friendly and generalized bit of code (with
extensive comments) to allow others to turn the GSSRM to their own questions and data. Ideally,
this would be a R package that would allow for the easier creation of models and model terms.
The case study of the Nicaraguan community is an important illustration of the model, but the
paper (and so the R code) present a complex series of models with many, many model terms. If
the author is truly interested in the wider adoption of the GSSRM, he can easily facilitate that
with, as I said, an R package, or simply a more annotated presentation of how to construct a
GSSRM model in R, with ample comments. More detail, too, could be given in the supplementary
materials to help interested potential practitioners.
Clarifying questions:
- Two indigenous groups are represented here (the Mayangna and Miskito), and yet we're not
told their proportion in the community, if those identities are locally salient, etc. To that point,
why is a term for this identity not included, when seemingly more particular measures like skin
color are?
- Some of the content of footnote 2 could be productively included in the body of the paper (i.e.,
N is 106/108).
4
- "Names of alters were read aloud" -- was this really a full listing of the 107 other adult residents?
Or perhaps just of focal members of households? More information on the data collection
methods would be helpful (and could largely be left to supplementary material).

GENERAL COMMENTS
The author presents an analysis of a social support network in a small-scale indigenous Nicaraguan
community. In doing so the author extends an existing statistical model, the Social Support Model, to
accommodate nodes that are nested within groups. This is a significant methodological contribution and
one that will be of great use to researchers with similarly structured data. The presentation is
theoretically sophisticated as well, combining elements of social network analysis, especially structural
balance theory, with hypotheses derived from human behavioral ecology.
Papers with this level of statistical sophistication are (unfortunately) uncommon in anthropology. While
the methods may not be of interest to anthropologists of a qualitative bent, the model presented in this
paper will be quite relevant to quantitative anthropologists who frequently struggle with the dyadic
dependencies and higher level groupings inherent in their own network data. Existing methods can
handle dyadic dependencies, but do not account as well for the nesting of nodes within households
presented here. Many of us who collect network data in the field have similarly structured data, so
these methods will be quite relevant.
SPECIFIC COMMENTS
3:9-12 (Prediction 1) You might make explicit the implied converse (that if i and j do not have a
connection, then other members of their households are similarly less likely to have connections).
3:15-16 “biological kinship is commonly regarded as the primary basis for social organization” I think
there’s enough debate within anthropology that we can’t say this is “commonly regarded”. I would be
prepared for others to take issue with this short-hand formulation. Your later analysis including affines,
distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate siblings, and employing fictive kinship relations of god
parentage shows this is a more complex issue than this simple summary statement. I would consider
revising this statement. (c.f. p. 14 line 60 “Another contribution of this research is its secondary focus on
social kinship.”)
3: 26 (mathematical formula) This notation might be cleaned up so that the index of summation (j <U+03F5> J)
appears below the Sigma, or (if kept in the current format) more space needs to be placed between the
index and the formula.
4:41-45: Why should other members of the household be expected to adjust their ties to accord with
those of the cuckquean? Why shouldn’t she instead be expected to adjust her ties to accord with those
of other members of her household? After all, her interests within the household may be in the minority
(as in Fig. 2).
4:47 (Prediction 3) “declines” relative to what? Presumably relative to pairs of households not having
adulterous ties?
9:2 This interest in affinal r (that is recognizing one’s interest in individuals that one has no direct
relatedness to, but with whom one shares an interest to a related third individual) might be framed in
terms of Gilbert Roberts’ concept of “stake”.
10: 22:29 The discussion here seems to suggest that the source of the variance in these terms is faulty
recall and differences in interpretation of the questions. However, p. 6, lines 21-26 explain these
variables capture deviations from average supportiveness. Couldn’t this variance reflect actual
differences in an individual’s (or household’s) propensity to give to or receive from others? More
generally, I’m confused why these variance terms are treated as if they are s problematic artifact of
error.
10:50 The abbreviation VPC is used here but has not yet been defined.
11:32 “In other words, the main effects of kinship continue to be strong, but there is little evidence for
moderating effects related to differences in need.” Personally, I would replace the word “need” here
with “wealth”. It’s unclear to me what degree chronic differences in wealth is a good proxy for more
immediate and potentially alternating differences in need that would motivate kin-directed altruism.
11:42 Typo: “…exhibits the predicted exhibit….”
12:20 Again, I would replace “relative need” with “relative wealth”.
13:30 and following: Bravo! This section is much improved over the earlier draft.
15:13-18 Gilbert Roberts’ work on stake is relevant here. You’re making a very similar argument.

February 27, 2018
Dear Dr. Shultz,
Thank you for the opportunity to revise the manuscript in light of the reviewer’s comments.
The reviews were quite helpful, and I am particularly glad for the opportunity to revise the
terminology in the paper. I believe that the changes have strengthened the paper considerably, and
the opportunity to publish this study in Open Science is much appreciated.
In response to specific comments from the reviewers, specific revisions to the paper include:
Reviewer 1
3:9-12 (Prediction 1) You might make explicit the implied converse (that if i and j do not have a
connection, then other members of their households are similarly less likely to have connections).
The hypothesis now includes this verbiage: “The same logic applies to the absence of ties, and
statistically, this will result in a pattern of group-level correlations between k and l.”
3:15-16 “biological kinship is commonly regarded as the primary basis for social organization” I
think
there’s enough debate within anthropology that we can’t say this is “commonly regarded”. I would
be prepared for others to take issue with this short-hand formulation. Your later analysis including
affines, distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate siblings, and employing fictive kinship
relations of god parentage shows this is a more complex issue than this simple summary statement. I
would consider revising this statement. (c.f. p. 14 line 60 “Another contribution of this research is its
secondary focus on social kinship.”)
The word “commonly” has been changed to “frequently.”
3: 26 (mathematical formula) This notation might be cleaned up so that the index of summation (j <U+03F5>
J) appears below the Sigma, or (if kept in the current format) more space needs to be placed between
the index and the formula.
The notation in this paper is drawn from the West and Gardner (2010) paper. For consistency in the
literature, I opted to use that notation.
4:47 (Prediction 3) “declines” relative to what? Presumably relative to pairs of households not
having adulterous ties?
This contrast has been made explicit.
9:2 This interest in affinal r (that is recognizing one’s interest in individuals that one has no direct
relatedness to, but with whom one shares an interest to a related third individual) might be framed in
terms of Gilbert Roberts’ concept of “stake”.
This is a helpful suggestion. At the same time, a reading of the Roberts’s paper in Animal Behavior
suggests that “stake” may be reduced to a kin selection formulation. That argument differs somewhat
from the point that I was aiming to make, and I instead refer readers to the 2000 paper by Doug
Jones.
10: 22:29 The discussion here seems to suggest that the source of the variance in these terms is
faulty recall and differences in interpretation of the questions. However, p. 6, lines 21-26 explain
these variables capture deviations from average supportiveness. Couldn’t this variance reflect actual
differences in an individual’s (or household’s) propensity to give to or receive from others? More
generally, I’m confused why these variance terms are treated as if they are a problematic artifact of
error.
Dr. Nolin is correct that the effect for individual participants potentially include both informant error
and genuine variation in giving. The text now includes a note about the alter-level covariates and that
the informant-level error is assumed to be averaged across the alters.
11:32 “In other words, the main effects of kinship continue to be strong, but there is little evidence
for moderating effects related to differences in need.” Personally, I would replace the word “need”
here with “wealth”. It’s unclear to me what degree chronic differences in wealth is a good proxy for
more immediate and potentially alternating differences in need that would motivate kin-directed
altruism.
I made this recommended change (and again for 12.20). That said, given that wealth correlates with
greater nutritional well-being, I do think that wealth is a useful (albeit imperfect) proxy of need.
Reviewer 2
I have two primary recommendations for the improvement of the paper. The first is an issue of
terminology. Throughout the paper, the author uses a set of terms to mean broadly the same thing:
group, unit, and household. This fluidity in terms often leads to a lack of clarity in the writing. For
example, it is not immediately obvious what "group," "inter-group," or "group-level" should be
referring to. In practice, they generally seem to be referring to households and inter-household
relationships, but you could easily forgive a reader for taking "group" to be a term for the entire
community, rather than this more local association, sometimes called, as I say, a household or a
residential unit. Greater consistency in terms, or at very least a statement at the start that defines
these terms in the context of the paper would greatly help the reader.
I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer. The unclear terminology relates to the difficulty of
defining a “household,” which previously led to the use of “residence units.” Now the version simply
indicates that “household” also signifies analogous residential units. Meanwhile, the use of “group”
has been largely restricted to the description of the statistical model and its parameters. The greater
focus on households provides a unifying thread that is very helpful.
Second, this is a paper that aims to do a good deal -- introduce a novel model, make theoretical
contributions to multiple fields, and present significant findings of an application of this model.
Streamlining the paper somewhat would help facilitate all of these tasks. Most notably, shifting some
of the presentation of the model (e.g., the many terms on page 7) to supplementary materials would
let the focus be on the broad contributions of the model to methods and theory, without unnecessarily
bogging down the reader. A simplified presentation of the main features of the model, with a more
elaborated presentation in the supplementary materials, would make for a more compelling paper.
I can appreciate that the statistical notation may seem unwieldy, but my impression is that this will
largely be remedied by professional typesetting, which will help readers to more easily distinguish
the different sections of the paper.
I similarly wonder why the models presented were quite as complex as they were, given that some
terms were found to have little effect (e.g., the BMI and skin color measures). Again, given the many
tasks that this article is attempting, it seems like a better solution might be simpler models with fewer
terms, and a note that other variables (such as BMI and skin color) were considered but excluded
(presumably they can't be helping model fit, if their effects are as negligible as reported). A slightly
simpler model would still present the value of the technique, without distracting the reader from the
main findings.
This study was not formally pre-registered, but I attempted to consider only the models that were
initially part of the research design. The covariates for phenotypic variables turned out not to exhibit
strong effects.
Finally, a recommendation to the author, but one which should not, I think, influence the decision to
publish this article in RS Open Science. The author clearly is trying to make the case that others
should use the Group-Structured Social Relations Model. He does indeed include the data files and R
code to replicate his particular set of models, but any push to really facilitate the adoption of this
model would really require a more user-friendly and generalized bit of code (with extensive
comments) to allow others to turn the GSSRM to their own questions and data. Ideally, this would be
a R package that would allow for the easier creation of models and model terms. The case study of
the Nicaraguan community is an important illustration of the model, but the paper (and so the R
code) present a complex series of models with many, many model terms. If the author is truly
interested in the wider adoption of the GSSRM, he can easily facilitate that with, as I said, an R
package, or simply a more annotated presentation of how to construct a GSSRM model in R, with
ample comments. More detail, too, could be given in the supplementary materials to help interested
potential practitioners.
An R package is an excellent long-term idea. At this stage, additional development is needed (e.g.,
models that permit negative dyadic reciprocity) before an R package would have broad utility. In the
meantime, the script has been annotated further to denote the import of the functions.
- Two indigenous groups are represented here (the Mayangna and Miskito), and yet we're not told
their proportion in the community, if those identities are locally salient, etc. To that point, why is a
term for this identity not included, when seemingly more particular measures like skin color are?
In this setting, the question of ethnicity can be a thorny one. Ethnicity is fluid such that two
individual with identical parentage may self-describe themselves as belonging to different ethnicities.
Also, individuals who were born to Miskito parents may begin to describe themselves as Mayangna
upon marrying a Mayangna spouse . . . even as others continue to describe them as Miskito. Given
these considerations, and given that skin color figures prominently in terms of identity, the latter
measure was used.
- "Names of alters were read aloud" -- was this really a full listing of the 107 other adult residents?
Or perhaps just of focal members of households? More information on the data collection methods
would be helpful (and could largely be left to supplementary material).
The text has been revised to note that the names of all potential alters were read aloud. It is indeed a
tedious method.
Page 5, Line 11: Gini should be capitalized.
Thank you for pointing out this oversight.
Page 9, Line 1: periodically
Again, thank you. The adjective was a holdover from an earlier draft before that sentence was
rephrased.
Thank you again for the consideration.
