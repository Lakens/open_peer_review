Liu et. al reported the “In-situ growing of CoO nanoparticles on g-C3N4 composites by facile
thermal annealing method with highly improved photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution.”
However, the synthesis of CoO@g-C3N4 nanocomposites thermal annealing method and their
photocatalytic potential for water splitting are reported in the literature (see Ref. Han et al. Inorg.
Chem. Front., 2017, 4, 1691–1696; Guo et al. Appl. Catal. B: Environ., 226, 2018, 412-420; Wang et
al., Inorg. Chem. Commun., 92, 2018, 14-17). The present work does not contribute any new
findings to the readers of material science/nanocatalysis areas. Moreover, Royal Society Open
Science journal publishes high-quality original research, in this sense, the novelty of present work
is not sufficient to warrant a publication in RSOS journal.
Major comments
1. The introduction of this manuscript is missing the important information on CoO as a
photocatalyst for water splitting, and H2O2 poisoning of catalyst surface and challenges to
overcome the drawbacks with citing the relevant Ref.’s for example, Xu et al. Angew. Chem. Int.
Ed. 2019, 58, 3032 –3036, DOI: 10.1002/anie.201807332. Shi et al. ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces,
2017, 20585–20593, DOI: 10.1021/acsami.7b04286; J. Mater. Chem. A, 2017, 19800-19807,
10.1039/C7TA06077G; Neatu, Chem. Commun., 2014,14643-14646, DOI: 10.1039/c4cc05931j;
2. Authors mentioned (presumed) in the Page 3 Line 14,… “Therefore, the combination of g-C3N4

change the samples notation, for example, g-C3N4@Pt, 0.3%CoO/g-C3N4@Pt...........etc inset of
Fog 6a..Include controlled catalysis of CoO alone and various wt% of CoO on g-C3N4 composites
for water splitting in the main manuscript.

included and it is not clear whether Pt is included or not in the Fig 6b analysis.

In this work, CoO nanoparticles are in-situ growing on the g-C3N4 to prepare CoO/g-C3N4
composite photocatalyst by facile thermal annealing method under nitrogen atmosphere.The
enhancement mechanism of photocatalytic overall water splitting for hydrogen evolution of as-
synthetized CoO/g-C3N4 nanocomposite is also discussed. There are still some shortcomings in
the paper. I believe the paper may be accepted for publication after carefully addressing the
following points.
1. CoO nanoparticles are in-situ growing on the g-C 3 N 4 in this paper. What is the novelty or
advantage over other literatures? The reason or characteristic for this method need to be
emphasized in Introduction.
2. The results from this paper could be compared with the data from previous literatures.
3. Some expressions need to improved, such as “can’t generate H 2 under”
4. The photocatalytic mechanisms of composites for water need to be discussed further, some
reference could be referred. Ceramics International, 44 (2018), 1711-1718, Journal of Membrane
Science, 520 (2016), 281-293; Ceramics International, 42 (2016), 15012-15022.
5. In the introduction, you should note the problems with traditional CoO/g-C3N4 combination
methods, which can make the reader know what is unique about your work.
6. There are many previous works about the in-situ synthesis of nanoparticles, such as
DOi:10.1016/j.electacta.2018.10.039, 10.1016/j.snb.2019.02.026 and so on. Is there improvement for
in-situ synthesis? These need to be explained in Introduction.

10.1039/c4cc05931j;
Response to Reviewer comment No. 1: According to the advice of reviewer, the
reference [Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2019, 58, 3032-3036] about CoO as a photocatalyst
for water splitting have been cited in the introduction section of revised manuscript.
The references [ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2017, 20585-20593; J. Mater. Chem. A,
2017, 19800-19807; Chem. Commun., 2014, 14643-14646] about have been cited in
the revised manuscript. Corresponding changes have been in the revised manuscript at
line 66-69 as follow.
2. Authors mentioned (presumed) in the Page 3 Line 14,… “Therefore, the
combination of g-C3N4 and CoO could achieve......... sacrificial agent. However, the
combination of g-C3N4 and CoO NPs has already known to be improved

412-420; Wang et al., Inorganic Chemistry Communications, 92, 2018, 14-17). This
phrase should be rewritten by including the above Ref.’s
Response to Reviewer comment No. 2: The phrase “It is reported that the combination
of g-C3N4 and CoO can be improved photocatalysts for water splitting.” has been
rewritten by the references [Inorg. Chem. Front., 2017, 4, 1691-1696; Applied
Catalysis B: Environmental, 226, 2018, 412-420; Inorganic Chemistry
Communications, 92, 2018, 14-17] in the revised manuscript. Corresponding changes
have been in the revised manuscript at line 69-74 as follow.
3. Thermal annealing method for preparation of CoO@g-C3N4 composites is known
in the literature (Ref, Han et al. Inorg. Chem. Front., 2017, 4, 1691-1696). Authors
should justify how their approach is different or improved process than the reported
Ref.
Response to Reviewer comment No.3: It is well known that the nanoparticles could be
highly dispersed by rotation-evaporation method. Therefore, photocatalytic hydrogen
generation performance of CoO/g-C3N4 composite will be improved by facile thermal
annealing and rotation-evaporation method compared with the reported references.
Corresponding changes have been in the revised manuscript at line 72 as follow.
4. The main focus of present work is to explore the catalytic potential of CoO/g-C3N4
composites without Pt co-catalyst. The present draft shows more emphasis on Pt
co-catalyst along with CoO/g-C3N4 in Fig 6a. Authors should move these controls
into the Supp Information, and change the samples notation, for example,
g-C3N4@Pt, 0.3%CoO/g-C3N4@Pt...........etc inset of Fog 6a. Include controlled
catalysis of CoO alone and various wt% of CoO on g-C3N4 composites for water
splitting in the main manuscript.
Response to Reviewer comment No. 4: In this paper, CoO/g-C3N4 composites with
Pt co-catalyst are investigated to explore CoO/g-C3N4 composite with well-defined
characteristics for overall water splitting. In the caption of figure 6a, the reaction
condition with 1.5wt% Pt has been specified for the reader’s better understanding.
The photocatalytic overall water-splitting performance of pure CoO has been studied
in the Figure 7. It is found that 0.6wt% CoO/g-C3N4 can split pure water to generate
H2 without sacrificial agent and noble metal Pt, while the pure g-C3N4 and bulk CoO
exhibit negligible photocatalytic activity towards H2 generation under the same
reaction condition. Corresponding changes have been in the revised manuscript.
5. The photocurrent studies of the composites in the presence of light and dark need to
be included in the manuscript.
Response to Reviewer comment No. 5: The photocurrent studies of the composites in
the presence of light and dark have been studied in the manuscript, as shown in figure
8(a). Photocurrent measurements are conducted on a conventional threeelectrode
system in an alternating voltage of 0.02 V under chopped illumination with 40 s light
on and off (dark) cycles.
6. The XPS characterization of recovered 0.6 wt% CoO/g-C3N4 catalyst need to be
included to see the changes on surfaces.
Response to Reviewer comment No. 6: The XPS characterization of recovered 0.6 wt%
CoO/g-C3N4 catalyst has been carried on to see the changes on surfaces. The
following figure R1 shows XPS profiles of O 1s and Co 2p of 0.6 wt% CoO/g-C3N4
and recovered 0.6 wt% CoO/g-C3N4 samples. After being recovered, the signal of Co
2p has no significant change. The O 1s spectra with two peaks at about 529 eV and
532 eV are shown in figure R1. The binding energy at 529 eV is ascribed to the Co-O
bond in the CoO phase, while the strong peak at about 532 eV corresponds to the
Co-O-C bond, indicating that a strong interaction exists between CoO and g-C3N4. It
can be seen that the signal of Co-O-C bond in the recovered 0.6 wt% CoO/g-C3N4
catalyst becomes much bigger than pure 0.6 wt% CoO/g-C3N4 because of the change
of electronic state of adsorbed oxygen species by formed H2O2.

were not clear in Fig 2. Move three Figures in one row by cropping the size of TEM

measured in the 10 vol% TEOA solution with 1.5 wt% Pt. Corresponding changes
have been in the caption of figure 6 in revised manuscript.
9. The notations in Fig 4 and 5 are not clear to the readers. Include a, b, c…etc. on the
curves with appropriate color on the sample codes.
Response to Reviewer comment No. 9: In figure 4 and figure 5, notations of the
samples are correspondence with the order of lines along the arrow.

1. Why the peak (532.2) of 5 wt% CoO/g-C3N4 is shifted to the lower binding energy
position? It is necessary to explain the trend of binding energy to the lower energy
level with the increasing the CoO wt%.
Response to Reviewer comment No. 1: The strong peak at about 532 eV corresponds
to the Co-O-C bond, while the binding energy at 529 eV is ascribed to the Co-O bond
in the CoO phase.35 The peak (532.2 eV) of 5 wt% CoO/g-C3N4 shifted to the lower
binding energy position is possible due to the stronger Co-O bond than the Co-O-C
bond in the composites with the increasing the CoO wt%.
2. The author need to give information of CoO/C3N4 composite prepared by the other
groups?
Response to Reviewer comment No. 2: CoO/C3N4 composites prepared by the other
groups [ref. 22-27] have been provided in the introduction section. But poor stability
of the CoO catalyst is caused by H2O2 poisoning to hinder its further
development.22-24 It is still a challenge to seek suitable structure of CoO based catalyst
with high stability. It is reported that the combination of g-C3N4 and CoO can be
improved photocatalysts for water splitting.25-27
3. Is the synthesis process of CoO, C3N4 and CoO/C3N4 is novel or other researcher
already prepared the materials by the same method?
Response to Reviewer comment No. 3: CoO/C3N4 composite prepared by thermal
annealing method has been reported by other literatures25-27. As the nanoparticles
could be highly dispersed by vacuum rotation-evaporation method, in this paper,
CoO/g-C3N4 composite is improved by vacuum rotation-evaporation and thermal
annealing method compared with these reported references.
4. The author need to give the data of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution the bare CoO
catalyst. It is necessary to compare it (bare CoO) with the CoO/C3N4 in Figure 6a
(hydrogen generation), Figure 7 (hydrogen generation), and in Figure 8 (impedance).
Response to Reviewer comment No. 4: The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
performance of bare CoO has been provided in the Figure 6a and Figure 7. In figure
6(a), it can be found that the photocatalytic H2 evolution amount for CoO/g-C3N4
composite with 0, 0.3, 0.6, 1, 5 and 100 wt% Co loading content is recorded to be
14.79, 17.19, 23.25, 13.02, 1.90 and 0.019 mmol g-1 after 5h, respectively. It is found
that 0.6wt% CoO/g-C3N4 can split pure water to generate H2 without sacrificial agent
and noble metal Pt, while the pure g-C3N4 and bulk CoO exhibit negligible
photocatalytic activity towards H2 generation under the same reaction condition.

1. CoO nanoparticles are in-situ growing on the g-C3N4 in this paper. What is the
novelty or advantage over other literatures? The reason or characteristic for this
method need to be emphasized in Introduction.
Response to Reviewer comment No. 1: It is still a challenge to seek suitable structure
of CoO based catalyst with high activity and stability. CoO/C3N4 composite prepared
by thermal annealing method has been reported by other literatures. As the
nanoparticles could be highly dispersed by vacuum rotation-evaporation method, in
this paper, CoO/g-C3N4 composite is improved by vacuum rotation-evaporation and
thermal annealing method compared with these reported references. Corresponding
changes have been in the revised manuscript at line 68-71 as follow.
2. The results from this paper could be compared with the data from previous
literatures.
Response to Reviewer comment No. 2: Compared with the reported 0.5 wt%
CoO/g-C3N4 (0.65 mmol h-1 g-1),34 30 wt% CoO/g-C3N4 (2.51 µmol h-1)26 and 10 wt%
CoO/g-C3N4 (0.46 µmol h-1),25 photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of
CoO/g-C3N4 composite could be improved by rotation-evaporation and thermal
annealing method. Corresponding changes have been in the revised manuscript at line
232-236 as follow.
3. Some expressions need to improved, such as “can’t generate H 2 under”.
Response to Reviewer comment No.3: The expressions have been modified. It is
found that 0.6wt% CoO/g-C3N4 can split pure water to generate H2 without sacrificial
agent and noble metal Pt, while the pure g-C3N4 and bulk CoO exhibit negligible
photocatalytic activity towards H2 generation under the same reaction condition.
Corresponding changes have been in the revised manuscript at line 244-245 as follow.
4. The photocatalytic mechanisms of composites for water need to be discussed
further, some reference could be referred. Ceramics International, 44 (2018),
1711-1718, Journal of Membrane Science, 520 (2016), 281-293; Ceramics
International, 42 (2016), 15012-15022.
Response to Reviewer comment No. 4: According to the advice of reviewer, the
references [Ceramics International, 44 (2018), 1711-1718, Journal of Membrane
Science, 520 (2016), 281-293; Ceramics International, 42 (2016), 15012-15022] have
been cited in the revised manuscript. Corresponding changes have been in the revised
manuscript at line 293 as follow.
5. In the introduction, you should note the problems with traditional CoO/g-C3N4
combination methods, which can make the reader know what is unique about your
work.
Response to Reviewer comment No. 5: The problems with traditional CoO based
materials have been noted in the introduction section in the revised manuscript. CoO
with efficient photo-induced electrons separation can be used as an effectively
co-catalyst to improve the photocatalytic water splitting activity for hydrogen
evolution. It is reported that the combination of g-C3N4 and CoO can be improved
photocatalysts for water splitting. But poor stability of the CoO catalyst is caused by
H2O2 poisoning to hinder its further development. It is still a challenge to seek
suitable structure of CoO based catalyst with high activity and stability. The particles
could be well dispersed on the carrier by vacuum rotation-evaporation method.28 In
this work, CoO nanoparticles are in-situ growing on the g-C3N4 to prepare
well-dispersed CoO/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst by vacuum rotation-evaporation
and thermal annealing method under nitrogen atmosphere. Corresponding changes
have been in the revised manuscript at line 66-74 as follow.
6. There are many previous works about the in-situ synthesis of nanoparticles, such as
DOi:10.1016/j.electacta.2018.10.039, 10.1016/j.snb.2019.02.026 and so on. Is there
improvement for in-situ synthesis? These need to be explained in Introduction.
Response to Reviewer comment No. 6: The vacuum rotation-evaporation method was
used to improve the in-situ synthesis. The particles could be well dispersed on the
carrier by vacuum rotation-evaporation method. In this work, CoO nanoparticles are
in-situ growing on the g-C3N4 to prepare well-dispersed CoO/g-C3N4 composite
photocatalyst by vacuum rotation-evaporation and thermal annealing method under
nitrogen atmosphere. Corresponding changes have been in the revised manuscript at
line 70-74 as follow.
