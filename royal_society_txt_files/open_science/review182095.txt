Based on an extensive characterization study complimentary findings enable the authors to
provide insight in the structure function relationship of cross linked PE particles filled HPPE
tubes made via a new, elegant rotational extrusion technology. The idea is to induce non-axial
orientation of self-enhanced polymer structures, improving the mechanical resilience in hoop
stress.
It is evident that characterization has been done we great expertise and care, leading to figures of
high quality. Also the translation of fundamental studies to product performance (hoop strength)
is appreciated. However, prior to publication minor revisions have to be pursued mainly on the
(over)interpretation and derived conclusions. The issues are listed below.
• Figure 1. To support and validate the interpretation on the properties of the cross-linked PEs
error bars need to be included. Generally stating, from the results it can be concluded (as the
authors at the end correctly do) that the most predominant improvement in properties is caused
by the oriented structures so it is advised not to over-interpret the differences in crystallinity and
lamellar thickness.
• Table 1. For adequate interpretation of the values of crystallinity and lamellar thickness based
on DSC error bars are a MUST here as well. For the calculation of lamellar thickness via the Gibbs
Thomson equation the melting temperature Tm is used. Of course the method provides an
average. However, what is the melting temperature? First of all, Tm needs to be accurately
described. Is it the peak temperature? Most importantly, since the sample mass varied between 6
and 9 mg, potential weight differences induce differences in the heat trasnfer efficiency changes,
causing a thermal lag that in turn affects the peak temperature. Hence, in order to tell whether the
minuscule variations of the DSC based values are statistically significant, the inclusion of error
bars are a must. Next, the interpretation of the data needs to be revised. Besides the value of
is missing and has to be included though the discussion considers relative changes.
• Table 1. Also for the XRD based values error bars must be included, validating the
interpretation. Since also here the variations in structural parameters is extremely small,
applicability of the Scherrer equation in calculation of crystal size and its significance should be
strengthened by the lamellar thickness derived from the long period in SAXS measurements that
in fact have been performed.
• Page 15: please support the statement that the introduction of crosslinked particles suppress the
thermal movement of molecular chains either experimentally (eg rheometry) or by adequate
references. Thus, please place the rheometry section discussed at page 22 here. Why would the
cross-linked structures preferably orient and from shishes? To support the hypothesis, including
information on the crosslinking degree of the Si-XLPE seems needed. The discussion repeats on
page 19, where it is stated that the chemical cross-linked structure affects the relaxation times of
the matrix polymer. If the rheometry section is place forward the paper/discussion improves
considerably.

of oriented molecular chains and in fact promotes relaxation to the random coil. Is there break-up
of the melt? Or, slip at mandrel – polymer interface?

In this work, the authors proposed an interesting strategy to enhance the performance of
polyethylene tubes. The modified polyethylene tubes, prepared by the addition of Si-XLPE in
rotation extrusion, showed improved performance. Structure-property relationship was very
carefully analyzed and discussed. Comprehensive characterization and discussion were
presented. The article is well-written. I only have minor comments for the authors to address.
1. Please provide the full phrase of S3M when it first appeared in the main text.
2. Based on section 2.2, the operating process can be found in a previous literature. Since this is
important to this study, the authors may want to consider either briefly describe the process in

Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your e-mail and the attached comments on our manuscript entitled
“Preparation of High Performance Polyethylene Tubes under the Coexistence of
Silicone Cross-linked Polyethylene and Rotation Extrusion” (RSOS-182095). Those
comments and suggestions are really helpful to improve our manuscript quality. All
the changes we made were clearly marked in red color in the revised manuscript and
the point-by-point responses to the reviewer comments are included hereinafter.
Response to Reviewer 1:
Q1. Figure 1. To support and validate the interpretation on the properties of the
cross-linked PEs error bars need to be included. Generally stating, from the results it
can be concluded (as the authors at the end correctly do) that the most predominant
improvement in properties is caused by the oriented structures so it is advised not to
over-interpret the differences in crystallinity and lamellar thickness.
A: Thank you for your instructive suggestions. The properties of the XLPE error bars
have been added into figure 1 in our revised manuscript. Indeed, the crystallinity and
lamellar thickness displayed no obvious impact on the reinforcement of the tubes and
thus we have further shortened the corresponding discussions in the revised
manuscript to emphasize the importance of the oriented structures.
Q2. Table 1. For adequate interpretation of the values of crystallinity and lamellar
thickness based on DSC error bars are a MUST here as well. For the calculation of

lamellar thickness via the Gibbs Thomson equation the melting temperature Tm is
used. Of course the method provides an average. However, what is the melting
temperature? First of all, Tm needs to be accurately described. Is it the peak
temperature? Most importantly, since the sample mass varied between 6 and 9 mg,
potential weight differences induce differences in the heat trasnfer efficiency changes,
causing a thermal lag that in turn affects the peak temperature. Hence, in order to tell
whether the minuscule variations of the DSC based values are statistically significant,
the inclusion of error bars are a must. Next, the interpretation of the data needs to be
revised. Besides the value of <U+F073> e is missing and has to be included though the
discussion considers relative changes.
A: You are right that the variation in mass can cause a thermal lag and thus lead to
changes of the peak temperature. In our study, the melting temperatures are all
defined as peak temperature in the melting curve and hence we have added the error
bars for Tm and the corresponding Lc in the Table 1. Finally, the <U+F073> e has also been
added in the revised manuscript. Thank you again for your suggestion.
Q3. Table 1. Also for the XRD based values error bars must be included, validating
the interpretation. Since also here the variations in structural parameters is extremely
small, applicability of the Scherrer equation in calculation of crystal size and its
significance should be strengthened by the lamellar thickness derived from the long
period in SAXS measurements that in fact have been performed.
A: As suggested, we have added the error bars for the values of crystallinity and

SICHUAN UNIVERSITY

lamellar thickness based on XRD and the long period of SAXS, respectively. Despite
crystalline data obtained from DSC and XRD slightly differed from each other, both
data displayed the same trend that with increasing mandrel rotation rate, the
crystallinity and lamellar thickness firstly increased and then slightly dropped once
the rotation rate exceeded 30 rpm. These results fit well with the explanation that
high-speed rotation can generate large amount of shear heat to facilitate the relaxation
of the stretched molecules to the random coil. The corresponding discussions have
been added in the revised manuscript.
Q4. Page 15: please support the statement that the introduction of crosslinked
particles suppress the thermal movement of molecular chains either experimentally
(eg rheometry) or by adequate references. Thus, please place the rheometry section
discussed at page 22 here. Why would the cross-linked structures preferably orient
and from shishes? To support the hypothesis, including information on the
crosslinking degree of the Si-XLPE seems needed. The discussion repeats on page 19,
where it is stated that the chemical cross-linked structure affects the relaxation times
of the matrix polymer. If the rheometry section is place forward the paper/discussion
improves considerably.
A: Thank you for your comments. As demonstrated by many open literature (1. Liu D,
Tian N, Cui K, Zhou W, Li X, Li L. 2013. Macromolecules, 46, 3435-3443. (DOI:
10.1021/ma400024m) 2. Tian Y, Zhu C, Gong J, Yang S, Ma J, Xu J. 2014. Polymer,
55(16), 4299-4306. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2014.06.056)), the formation of

shish is a competing process between stretch and relaxation of the molecular chains.
The mobility of the molecular chains is the key factor that determines the final
configuration. In rheology, the mobility of the molecular chains can be reflected by
the value of relaxation time <U+03BB>. According to the frequency sweep at 210 °C, the
relaxation time of the PE and XPE specimens is 0.47s and 1.04s, respectively.
Apparently, the molecular chains of the XPE are harder to move and accordingly are
capable to maintain their stretched configuration under the subsequent cooling
procedure. Correspondingly, the related discussions as well as the information on the
crosslinking degree of the Si-XLPE have also been added in the revised manuscript.
Thank you for your suggestion.
Q5. Page 17. Please support the explanation that the higher mandrel rotation rate
restrains growth of oriented molecular chains and in fact promotes relaxation to the
random coil. Is there break-up of the melt? Or, slip at mandrel – polymer interface?
A: Thank you for your instructive suggestions. As discussed earlier, the formation of
shish involves two competing procedure, i.e. the stretch and relaxation of the
molecular chains. The former one is the result of stress filed which is thermodynamic
instability and the latter one is derived from the molecular thermal motion. With
increasing rotation rate, a large amount of heat was generated inside the polyethylene
due to the shear between mandrel and melt. Since polymer is a poor conductor of heat,
shear heat was keen to concentrate in local area, and thus accelerated the thermal
motion of molecular chains where the stretching molecular chains relaxed into the

random coil. (1. Cho S, Jeong S, Kim JM, Baig C. 2017. SCI REP-UK 7, 9004.

As far as we know, the shear rate is not too high to cause obvious break-up of the melt
or slip at interface, because despite the fast speed, the outer diameter of the mandrel is
only 4mm. The explanation has been included in the revised manuscript.
Q6. It is advised to run a spelling checker once more as grammar mistakes are
encountered regularly.
A: Thank you for your comment, and we have carefully revised our manuscript and
polished the English writing in our revised manuscript. The inappropriate expression
and mistakes have been corrected.
Response to Reviewer 2:
Q1. Please provide the full phrase of S3M when it first appeared in the main text.
A: We have added the full phrase of S3M in our revised manuscript. The full phase of
S3M is solid-state shear mechanochemical.
Q2. Based on section 2.2, the operating process can be found in a previous literature.
Since this is important to this study, the authors may want to consider either briefly
describe the process in the experimental section or in the supporting information.
A: Indeed, the operating process has great impact on the final properties of the XLPE.

Si-XLPE material such as gel content and melt flow rate has been added in section 2.1
