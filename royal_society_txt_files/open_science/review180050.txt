The paper RSOS-180050 titled "Spatial distribution of heavy metals and ecological risk assessment
in tea garden soils at An'xi county southeast China" try to investigate the areal distribution of
some hazardous elements. However there are several problems concerning the statistical analysis
of the data. First of all, exploratory analysis was not performed and the values of mean and
standard deviation were considered as reference without criticism. Unfortunately most of the
investigated elements are characterized by anomalous values, presence of skewness or
plurimodality all features that highly affect the meaning of the average value. This situation
affects in a strong way also the bivariate analysis so that the calculated linear correlation
coefficient could have not "geochemical and statistical" sense. Added to this there is also the
problems of "compositional data" that is completely ignored by the authors. Compostional data
move in a constrained sample space, called simplex" where the Euclidean statistics cannot be
applied since affected by distortion and bias. Form the Aitchison book (1986) a lot of
investigation has characterized this field of the research. Thus, by considering this perspective
and the lack of a well based exploratory analysis, the results and the discussion are seriously
compromised. Finally the author present as final step of their analysis a geostatitical
investigation. However they simply present the application of a deterministic method as that of
the inverse of the distance, a possible lost opportunity, since real geostatistical methods could be
more appropriate since able to quantify the uncertainty of the estimation. it is obvious that the
application of any spatial algorithm requires the exploratory analysis since presence of outliers or
bimodality or high skewness affects the estimation in not-sampled points. Thus, statistical
analysis appears to be not appropriate to sustain the aims of the paper.
For all the previous reasons I think that the paper cannot be accepted for publication in this form
and a serious major revision is required since the statistical analysis would be redone with
implications for the interpretation of the results.

General comments
The paper “Spatial distribution of heavy metals and ecological risk assessment in tea garden soils
at An'xi county southeast China” could be, in principle, an interesting contribution on the
assessment of potentially harmful elements in an area of China.
This paper has a potential to be accepted, but its present form, it seems a routine work in which
different, well-established methods are applied, nevertheless there is no novel approach. Some
points have to be clarified or fixed before it might be publishable because mask the parts that
could be evaluated as original contributions and that could be thus of interest for international
readers.
With suggested improvements along these lines, the paper can make a good case of soil
geochemical monitoring.
In the whole text the author should be replace “heavy metals” with “potentially harmful
elements”. This is the most suitable lettering to indicate the heavy metals and the other harmful
elements.
Some language improvements (both style and grammar) are also required. The paper needs to be
edited by an English mother language person. Some typos occur.
I think there is a lot of work to do before the paper might be publishable. However, I encourage
authors to try to do it.
Specific comments
Abstract
Normally, the Abstract should briefly describe the work discussed in the paper giving
information about sampling procedure, adopted analytic methods, and give a concise summary
of the findings. The Abstract should better re-organized; it should describe better the objectives of
the work and give the most important information about research carried out.
The authors should indicate the width of the study area in which the soil samples have been
collected.
The authors should avoid including the numerical results in the Abstract.

1. Introduction
The Introduction appears too general, it should introduce the subject of the paper in a more
concrete way referring to the importance to assess the distribution of soil potentially harmful
elements for human and ecological risks and to use geostatistics for their spatial patterns. This
could be addressed providing several recent references to substantiate the claim made in the
thesis of paper (that is, provide references to other groups who do or have done research in this
area). For example, good surveys can be found here:
• Guagliardi I., Cicchella D., De Rosa R., Ricca N., Buttafuoco G., 2018. Geochemical sources of
vanadium in soils: evidences in a southern Italy area. Journal of Geochemical Exploration, 184,
358-364;
• Buttafuoco G., Guagliardi I., Tarvainen T., Jarva J., 2017. A multivariate approach to study the
geochemistry of urban topsoil in the city of Tampere, Finland. Journal of Geochemical
Exploration, 181, 191-204;
• Buttafuoco G., Tarvainen T., Jarva J., Guagliardi I., 2016. Spatial variability and trigger values of
arsenic in the surface urban soils of the cities of Tampere and Lahti, Finland. Environmental Earth
Sciences 75, 896;
• Guagliardi I., Ricca N., Cicchella D., 2016. From rock to soil: geochemical pathway of elements
in Cosenza and Rende area (Calabria, southern Italy). Rend. Online Soc. Geol. It. 38, 55-58. doi:
10.3301/ROL.2016.16.
The authors should modify the indication of the references “…and co-workers” in “…et al.”.
What does the sentence “… rationalize their origins” (line 40, page 4) mean?
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Description of study area
In this paragraph, the geological setting of the study area is completely missing. It is fundamental
indicating the parent materials of the area to better understand the composition of soil. As well
as, it is useful better describing the type of soils occurring in the study area.
Moreover, which are the anthropogenic activities (including main road networks, industries)
present in the study area that could influence the distribution of the potentially harmful
elements?
It is necessary include a geological map of the study area with the indication of the lithotypes
present in order to compare the possible natural input of elements in the soil.
2.2 Soil sampling
How large the study area is? Are only 78 topsoil samples collected enough to cover the study
area? The authors should justify this choice.
2.3 Physical and chemical analysis
There is no mention of precision and accuracy about quality control analysis.
Which are the detection limits of elements for each analytical methods?
2.4 Data analysis
This section is quite scarce: it lacks of the description of the main assumptions. There is a
substantial error: the inverse distance weighting (IDW) used by authors is a geometric method
and not a geostatistical one. The authors should give more details about deterministic method
adopted furnishing information on every step of approach from data transformation to
deterministic analysis.
Not all readers of RSOS are necessarily specialists in these topics. If the authors consider them too
obvious, they should refer to previous works in which these issues are clarified for interested
readers.
6
Results and Discussion
My major concern regards this section. About the Discussion, the authors do not make some
important contribution of thought to the paper, but merely summarize data.
The authors refer to “phosphorus and potassium” and “manganese and copper” as determined
elements but in the previous sections there is no mention about them.
Descriptive statistics are quite poor: Table 1 should include other statistical parameters to better
characterize soil data.
The error in considering IDW a geostatistical approach is again repeated.
The text from line 33 (page 8) to line 29 (page 9) should be moved from sub-paragraph 3.2
because it is not about the geostatistical analysis of data.
In which way have been the “soil background values of heavy metals at provincial and national
standards” (line 33/34, page 8) calculated? There is no mention about references for them.
What are the “calculated standard-reaching rates”? There is no mention about them before.
What does the sentence “… overall good condition of heavy metals” (line 6, page 9) mean?
The authors refer to “soil parent materials” for Cr accumulation but they never approach the
geology of the area, so it is difficult for readers understanding which type of parent materials
could influence the presence of Cr.
What is the “integrate RI” (line 50, page 9)?
What does the sentence “Cd is the characteristic elements in soils when extensive agricultural
activities are applied” (line 16, page 10) mean?
Including a map of the main road networks could be useful to better understand i.e. Pb and Hg
distributions.
4. Conclusions
This section is a mere summary and repetition of parts of previous sections. It is to be rewritten
focusing on more concreteness.
The authors should avoid including the numerical results in the Conclusions.

Dear Dr. Cao,
Your manuscript has been examined by three experts who provide contrasting recommendations.
Reviewer 2 concludes that the manuscript may be acceptable after minor revisions, Reviewer 3
maintains that major revisions are required before the manuscript can be considered for
publication and Reviewer 2 recommends rejection. Although there is some overlap in their
comments, the amount of revisions required is substantial, especially regarding the statistical
treatment of the data and requires considerable restructuring of the manuscript.
Faced with these reviews, and from my own reading of the paper, I believe a substantially
revised manuscript has the potential to make an important contribution if major revisions are
completed, with special consideration to the criticisms of reviewers 1 and 3.
9
All reviewers require more details and references on the methods section and reviewers 3
suggests several changes and ways to improve the manuscript including the use of the
Enrichment Factor Index.
Reviewer 1 is the most critical of your work, in particular highlighting several major issues and
questions regarding the statistical treatment of the data and the lack of an appropriate
exploratory statistical analysis. This issue is extremely important, especially to the final geo-
statistical analysis of the data, and will have to be thoroughly addressed.
In revising the manuscript I suggest to include a "complementary" file in your submission that
outlines how you've addressed the comments and queries of the reviewers.

General comments
The authors have revised the paper “Assessment of tea garden soils at An'xi County southeast
China reveals a mild threat from contamination of potentially harmful elements” but further
review is still recommended.
Specific comments
Abstract
I disagree including the numerical results in the Abstract, as well as in the Conclusions.
1. Introduction
The authors have not revised the Introduction as suggested. There is no indication about the
suggested references, which are useful especially for the geostatistical approach adopted.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Description of study area
The geological setting of the study area is still missing, only a very brief and unsatisfactory
description of minerals has been included. There is no reference to addition of geological map.
17
Results and Discussion
Connecting to previous suggestion, the authors refer to “parent materials and pedogenic
processes” for Cr accumulation but they did not approach the geology of the area.
About the questions asked in the first review, the related answers should be written in the text.

Dear Dr Liu,
Thank you for submitting the revised manuscript. Since you have performed the minor revisions
requested by the reviewer my recommendation is that the manuscript can be now accepted for
publication on Royal Society Open Science
Appendix A
Evaluation of “Spatial distribution of heavy metals and ecological risk assessment in tea
garden soils at An’xi county southeast China”, co-authored by Cao, Hai-Le; Cai, Feng-
Ying; Jiao, Wen-Bin; Liu, Cheng; Zhang, Ning and Lü, Jian, and submitted to Royal Society
Open Science (RSOS-180050).
Agreed to review manuscript in 14 February 2018.
February 28 2018
Cao et al. assessed the spatial distribution and enrichment of heavy metals (HM) in tea
garden soils covering 23 sites at An’xi county, southeast China. Five trace elements (As, Cd,
Cr, Hg and Pb) as well as pH and organic matter were measured in 78 soil samples.
Geostatistical analysis was performed to explore HM distribution in the study area and the
HM enrichment was assessed through ecological potential risk index (Håkanson, 1980.). HM
concentrations were compared against local threshold values, as well as HM levels measured
in further tea gardens in Asia.
Tea (Camellia sinensis L.) Kuntze is largely consumed worldwide; therefore, the
assessment of HM and their sources in one of the most productive tea garden areas in China is
undoubtedly relevant and has merit. The information presented here will certainly be valuable
to readers of Royal Society Open Science, managers and even to the public at large.
However, there are a number of issues that should take into account before publication.
English language revision, particularly writing style, is also recommended.
Title:
“Results-describing” rather “methods-describing” titles have been proven as more attractive,
helping to increase the visibility and citation of the research (Paiva et al. 2012). In my opinion
“spatial distribution of HM and ecological risk in…” as suggested in this manuscript, is often
used. I would suggest: “Tea garden soils at An’xi county, southeast China are threatened by
heavy metals contamination”; “Assessment of tea garden soils at An’xi county, southeast
China reveals heavy metal contamination threat” or something similar.
Abstract:
The abstract does include key findings and has an appropriate length. However, it
should be rewritten in a more clear and concise way. Please see additional comments in the
end of this document.
Introduction:
Introduction is adequate and does put the theme into perspective. However, I suggest
adding the author of a scientific name in the text, as recommended by the International Code
of Nomenclature for Plants (McNeill et al. 2012). So, in this case, please write Camellia
sinensis (L.) Kuntze.
The authors cited a new index applied by the Tea Research Association (TRAHMCI) on lines
23-26, page 4. Should not the application of this index in this research also interesting?
Materials and Methods:
This is a very important section of the manuscript and should be described more
carefully.
I would recommend a more detailed description of the study site. Information about
altitude and climate for example should also be supplied. Please add information about
planting areas size and how many regions/sampling stations (23?) were sampled and why
were they chosen. How were the 78 samples distributed? Please clarify how many samples
were taken in each region?
It is important to cite the references from which the methods were reproduced.
Data analysis must be clearly and detailed described.
Results and discussion:
This section is quite confusing. Results should be presented at first and then discussed.
The statement on lines 10-18 (page 7) is not clear to me and is in part, not
corroborated by data.
Not sure why east soils (line 35) were considered as alkaline. As shown in the table 1
pH ranged between 3.6 and 7.3 in the data set.
Not sure what “local human activities and communications” mean.
The results were poorly discussed on lines 6-9 (page 8).
Why As concentrations were considered on line 48 (page 8) as “well below the
background values”? On figure 5a several sampling points are above the threshold values.
Please clarify “standard-reaching rates” and why a good condition of HM contents was
suggested.
I think the statement about Pb, Cd and Cr sources would be better explored if the
Enrichment Factor Index (Sinex and Wright, 1988) had been applied. This index indicates if
an element is originated from a natural or anthropic source. I believe it would substantially
improve the discussion of the data.
The section 3.4 is a bit confusing because the same data was somehow discussed in the
section 3.2.
On lines 50-51 a high coefficient of variation of Cr is related to the discharge of
wastewater; however, on lines 22-23 (page 9) Cr is suggested as being originated from natural
sources. In addition, I am not sure why a high coefficient of variation would be related to HM
enrichment from anthropogenic sources. I understand coefficient of variation (ratio of the
standard deviation to the mean) simply like a measure of dispersion; and not necessarily with
HM enrichment. Besides, except pH, all variables showed very high coefficient of variation.
Are we talking about the same coefficient of variation??? It is not clear in the material and
methods. Moreover, Cr content in most samples is under background value (Figure 5c) and
not “over” as described on line 48 (page 10).
Not sure what “region-dependent characteristic of heavy metal pollution” does mean
(lines 3-4; page 11).
I am very surprised with the statement on lines 6-9 (page 11). There is no discussion
about the data on table 3.
I strongly recommend a substantial improvement of the discussion. The discussion
should be rewritten in a more careful and detailed way.
Conclusions:
The conclusions are very similar to the abstract, i.e. only summarizing the results, particularly
on lines 21-33 (page 11).
The China Environmental and Technical Requirements for Tea Production was not cited
anywhere before. Where were the standards for soils presented? It does not make sense to
show it only in the conclusions.
The information about 80% of the sampled soils is favorable for tea growth because acidic
conditions, is not clear in the data. No data about alkaline soils is shown. The pH ranged
among 3.6 to 7.3. Moreover, based on the table 1 and figure 2a it is not possible to confirm
the number of 80%. Please clarify this information and be sure that the main conclusions are
described and not the results/discussion is repeated.
References:
I am not sure why Hakanson is cited as “Amuno, L.” (ref. 33). Please correct this information.
Figures:
I would suggest modifying the figure 5. It would be interesting if instead of open circles;
samples could be shown with codes or different symbols for each region. For example using
the number of the regions showed on the figure 1. Is that possible? It would help to see main
differences between samples on the graph.
Please add coordinates in the figure 1.
Figure 2 – Please add (a) and (b) to each figure. Please add units in the figure caption (Figure
3 as well).
Tables:
Please elaborate new tables in a more clear way. Avoid vertical lines.
Table 3 – your data should come at first. Please change the position.
Additional comments:
Abstract:
Overall English writing style should be improved.
<U+F0B7> Lines 10-15: It sounds as HM, organic matter and pH were analyzed by geostatistical
approaches. Actually GIS maps show the distribution of the data, but HM and the
other parameters were not measured through this tool. Please rewrite this sentence.
<U+F0B7> Lines 24-27: Please avoid references in the abstract. Perhaps replace “Hakanson
method” by “ecological potential risk index (RI)” and then, in the next sentence,
simply use “RI”.
<U+F0B7> Overall the document, line numbering is strange. Numbers do not follow lines
correctly. Please check it.
Introduction:
<U+F0B7> Please add some reference to the statements on lines 12-15.
<U+F0B7> Please correct the word “organic matters” to “organic matter” throughout the
document.
<U+F0B7> Is not the year after the author citation (e.g. lines 6 to 11, page 4) necessary?
Unfortunately I could not find this information on the “Instruction to authors”
document.
Objectives:
<U+F0B7> Please rewrite lines 28-43 and replace the sentence: “The following research targets
has been successfully achieved” to “This study aimed to…”, “In order to evaluate
heavy metal enrichment” or something similar.
Materials and Methods:
<U+F0B7> Lines 45-46: Please replace “The soil organic matters” to “Soil organic matter was
determined by …”
<U+F0B7> Please add references of the applied methods.
<U+F0B7> Lines 4-11 (page 6) should described in details.
Results and Discussion:
<U+F0B7> Please add table and/or figure numbers on line 11 (page 7):
<U+F0B7> I did not understand why the adjectives “inadequate”, “imbalanced” on line 14 were
used.

1. All Reviewers require more details and references on the methods section and
Reviewers 3 suggests several changes and ways to improve the manuscript including
the use of the Enrichment Factor Index.
Answer: We have fully considered the comments from Reviewer 3 and revised
accordingly the manuscript.
2. Reviewer 1 is the most critical of your work, in particular highlighting several
major issues and questions regarding the statistical treatment of the data and the lack
of an appropriate exploratory statistical analysis. This issue is extremely important,
especially to the final geo-statistical analysis of the data, and will have to be
thoroughly addressed.
Answer: We have fully considered the comments from Reviewer 1 and revised
accordingly the manuscript.
3
Reviewer #1:
1. First of all,exploratory analysis was not performed and the values of mean and
standard deviation were considered as reference without criticism. Unfortunately
most of the investigated elements are characterized by anomalous values, presence
of skewness or plurimodality all features that highly affect the meaning of the average
value. This situation affects in a strong way also the bivariate analysis so that the
calculated linear correlation coefficient could have not "geochemical and statistical"
sense.
Answer: According to the Reviewer comments, abnormal values are
eliminated for calculating the overall statistical results i.e. metal concentrations, pH
and SOM. In descriptive statistics, the skewness, kurtosis, K-S test have been
includeed, and the exploratory analysis is performed.
Exploratory analysis:
Basic statistics for concentrations of potentially harmful elements in the top
soil samples is shown in Table 1. The mean concentration of Cr in the study area is
significantly lower than the local background value, and the mean concentration of
As at An'xi is slightly lower than the average background value [8]. However, the
average concentrations for Cd, Hg and Pb are higher than their background values
by up to 1.80 times, 1.25 times and 1.24 times, respectively. The comparatively
medium coefficient of variation (CV) for all potentially harmful elements showed
fairly large geochemical variability in concentrations for each two metals in the
sampled soils. Generally, the degree of variation can be divided into 3 levels: CV <
10% is considered as weak variability, and 10% < CV < 100% defines moderate
variability, whereas CV > 100% is strong variable [10]. The coefficient of variation
of all potentially harmful elements at An'xi is in moderate variation, following an
4
order of Cr > Cd > Pb > As > Hg, which indicates the concentration of elements
shows moderate geochemical variation. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test indicates
that concentrations of As, Cd, Cr and Pb in soils are in compliance with normal
distribution, while Hg shows abnormal distribution. However, the Hg concentration
could pass normality test after logarithmic transformation. The skewness, being a
parameter related to the normal distribution, also confirms the above results.
Furthermore, the kurtosis value suggests that Hg distribution has a distinct cluster
around relatively low values. According to the environmental requirements for
growing area of tea in China (NY/T 853–2004), the As, Cd, Cr and Pb
concentrations in all soil samples are below the threshold concentration, while the
Hg concentration exceeds the guideline value in less than 2% of the samples.
Therefore. the soils at An'xi county are slightly contaminated with Hg, and a small
amount of accumulated Cd and Pb, which is also generally the case for soils in
other agricultural areas in China.
2. Added to this there is also the problems of "compositional data" that is completely
ignored by the authors. Compostional data move in a constrained sample space, called
simplex" where the Euclidean statistics cannot be applied since affected by distortion
and bias. Form the Aitchison book (1986) a lot of investigation has characterized this
field of the research. Thus, by considering this perspective and the lack of a well
based exploratory analysis, the results and the discussion are seriously compromised.
Answer: In order to address these concerns, we have performed Principal
component analysis (PCA) and exploratory analysisto the data. Details are as
follows:
Statistical and geostatistical analysis
5
Pearson’s correlation analysis of soil parameters generally provides important
information for identifying the relationship between the variables and PHE sources.
Thus, a multivariate statistical analysis was conducted by using SPSS 20.0. Based
on the above results, principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to con<U+FB01>rm
the potential tracers of PHEs, natural enrichment or anthropogenic inputs.
Moreover, varimax rotation was employed to minimize the spatial dimension of
variables. The original data on the PHEs was normalized by logarithm and
Box–Cox transformation before geostatistical analysis, and then the processed data
were analyzed through the ArcMap10.2. Kriging interpolation and GIS mapping
were applied to establish the spatial distribution maps of PHEs.
Correlation analysis
Pearson correlation coefficients [40,41] have been performed to analyze the
correlation between variables, including SOMs, pH, and PHEs (Table 2). The pH
shows significant positive correlation with Cd (r=0.325a) and Pb (r=0.353a),
respectively, which suggests Cd and Pb have the trend of accumulation with pH
increase. Of special note, the signi<U+FB01>cant positive correlations were found between
the elemental pairs Cd–Pb (r=0.296b) at the 0.05 signi<U+FB01>cance level, implying their
same sources and similar pathways of accumulation.
Principal component analysis (PCA) for PHEs in soil
PCA has been widely applied to study the sources of PHEs in soil [15]. The
PCA results suggested that eigenvalues of three components were greater than 1.0
and accounted for ca. 70.1 of the data variation (Table 3). It was observed from the
rotated component matrix that the <U+FB01>rst principal component (PC1) was closely
related to Cd and Pb, and explained ca. 26.1% of the total variation. The second
6
principal component (PC2) included Hg and As, whereas Cr was classi<U+FB01>ed as the
third principal component (PC3). PC2 and PC3 contributed ca. 22.1% and ca.
21.9% of the total variation, respectively.
Component 1: Cd/Pb
Cd and Pb have shown similar distribution patterns in the soil sample pro<U+FB01>les,
featured by massive enrichment at east An'xi area, especially in high pH areas (2,
19 and 4). The percentage of Cd and Pb over background values is 68% and 61.8%
respectively. These elements are mainly derived from anthropogenic sources that
are associated with agricultural and industrial activities.
Component 2: As/Hg
The percentage of As and Hg over background values is 36.0% and 58.4%,
respectively. The main source of these heavy metal pollutants is more likely wastes
produced by various industrial activities that enter the soils through atmospheric
deposition, surface runoff and sewage irrigation.
Component 3: Cr
Cr could be de<U+FB01>ned as a natural resource, as the average concentrations of Cr
are well below the background values. Thus, the contents and spatial distribution of
Cr are mainly controlled by natural factors, such as parent material and pedogenic
processes.
3. Finally the author present as final step of their analysis a geostatitical investigation.
However they simply present the application of a deterministic method as that of the
inverse of the distance, a possible lost opportunity, since real geostatistical methods
could be more appropriate since able to quantify the uncertainty of the estimation. it
is obvious that the application of any spatial algorithm requires the exploratory
analysis since presence of outliers or bimodality or high skewness affects the
7
estimation in not-sampled points. Thus, statistical analysis appears to be not
appropriate to sustain the aims of the paper.
Answer: We have re-analyzed the data by using standard Kriging spatial
interpolation (Ordinary Kriging) by removing the outliers so that the data basically
obeys the normal distribution. Details are as follows:
Data analyses such as descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were
performed by SPSS 20.0 software. Geostatistical analysis was used to generate
visual images of spatial heavy metal distribution by using ArcGIS 10.2.
Geostatistical methods are very important to the study of variations of soil spatial
properties and regional heavy metal pollution. It has been proved to be one of the
most effective methods of analyzing the spatial distribution variability of heavy
metals in soil. Geostatistical spatial analyses were used to generate a semi–variance
map and describe spatial variability. ArcGIS 10.2 was extensively employed,
including the semi–variogram of the calculation and <U+FB01>tting comparison, Kriging
spatial interpolation (Ordinary Kriging), and simulation error analysis etc.
Pearson’s correlation analysis of soil parameters generally provids important
information for identifying the relationship between the variables and PHE sources.
Thus, a multivariate statistical analysis was conducted by using SPSS 20.0. Based
on the above results, principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to con<U+FB01>rm
the potential tracers of PHEs, natural enrichment or anthropogenic inputs.
Moreover, varimax rotation was employed to minimize the spatial dimension of
variables. The original data on the PHEs was normalized by logarithm and
Box–Cox transformation before geostatistical analysis, and then the processed data
were analyzed through the ArcGIS10.2. Kriging interpolation and GIS mapping
were applied to establish the spatial distribution maps of PHEs.

Reviewer #2:
1. The objectives of the present study was excellent. The authors written a manuscript
in good manner. There are few comments to be corrected for the better shape of the
article.
Section 2.3. Physical and chemical analysis: Authors requested to write this in
detailed. Each parameter need a method reference either previously published or
national standard or international standard method to be cited. If it is in-house method,
need full validation parameters. Also, authors are requested to mention the instrument
make and model, calibration range.
Answer: We have revised section 2.3 Physical and chemical analysis according
to the Reviewer comments. Details are as follows:
The concentration of Cd and Pb were determined by graphite furnace atomic
absorption spectrometry on a KOROMEE KAAS–2001E spectrometer (Shanghai,
China). As and Hg contents were measured by atomic fluorescence spectrometry on
a JITIAN AFS–933 spectrometer (Beijing, China). Concentration of Cr was
measured on a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer (INESA 361MC,
Shanghai, China).

Reviewer #3:
1. Title:
“Results-describing” rather “methods-describing” titles have been proven as
more attractive, helping to increase the visibility and citation of the research (Paiva et
al. 2012). In my opinion “spatial distribution of HM and ecological risk in…” as
suggested in this manuscript, is often used. I would suggest: “Tea garden soils at
An’xi county, southeast China are threatened by heavy metals contamination”;
“Assessment of tea garden soils at An’xi county, southeast China reveals heavy metal
contamination threat” or something similar.
Answer: We have revised the Title according to Reviewer comments.
2. Abstract:
The abstract does include key findings and has an appropriate length. However,
it should be rewritten in a more clear and concise way. Please see additional
comments in the end of this document.
Answer: We have revised the Abstract according to Reviewer comments.
3. Introduction:
Introduction is adequate and does put the theme into perspective. However, I
suggest adding the author of a scientific name in the text, as recommended by the
International Code of Nomenclature for Plants (McNeill et al. 2012). So, in this case,
please write Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze.
The authors cited a new index applied by the Tea Research Association (TRAHMCI)
on lines 23-26, page 4. Should not the application of this index in this research also
interesting?
Answer: We have replace Camellia sinensis with the nomenclature suggested
10
by the Reviewer. We consider the TRAHMCI index is more applicable to reveal
correlation of heavy metals and organic contents which is not in full agreement to
our study.
4. Materials and Methods:
This is a very important section of the manuscript and should be described more
carefully.
I would recommend a more detailed description of the study site. Information about
altitude and climate for example should also be supplied. Please add information
about planting areas size and how many regions/sampling stations (23?) were
sampled and why were they chosen. How were the 78 samples distributed? Please
clarify how many samples were taken in each region?
It is important to cite the references from which the methods were reproduced.
Data analysis must be clearly and detailed described.
Answer: We have revised the Materials and Methods section according to the
Reviewer comments by adding more and detailed information about sampling
areas, methodology and references.
5. Results and discussion:
This section is quite confusing. Results should be presented at first and then
discussed.
Answer: The combination of Results and Discussion becomes more and more
popular in many journals. Considering the more general readership or RSOS, we
are afraid of individual Results and Discussions will be too plain to attract readers
to follow the whole idea of both parts, therefore we believe the tight combination of
these two parts will be more efficient.
11
The statement on lines 10-18 (page 7) is not clear to me and is in part, not
corroborated by data.
Answer: We have removed these data due to the reason that they are not the
core of the manuscript.Extra emphasis will possibly lead to confusion to readers.
Not sure why east soils (line 35) were considered as alkaline. As shown in the
Table R1 pH ranged between 3.6 and 7.3 in the data set.
Answer: We have revised this part by replacing misleading words ‘acidic’ and
‘alkaline’. Instead we provide pH ranges of preferable conditions for tea grows so
that readers can have a clear mind with these data.
Not sure what “local human activities and communications” mean.
Answer: ‘local human activities and communications’ refers to activities of
local habitants and human communities, including interaction and transportation
amongst people.
The results were poorly discussed on lines 6-9 (page 8).
Answer: We have revised the Results and Discussion section.
Why As concentrations were considered on line 48 (page 8) as “well below the
background values”? On figure 5a several sampling points are above the threshold
values.
Answer: This refers to the average concentration as mentioned in the text,
which suggests data points shall be below or close to the background values.
12
Please clarify “standard-reaching rates” and why a good condition of HM
contents was suggested.
Answer: The standard-reaching rate of Hg is 98.7% and that for other PHEs is
100%, which is considered as an overall good condition of PHE contamination.
I think the statement about Pb, Cd and Cr sources would be better explored if the
Enrichment Factor Index (Sinex and Wright, 1988) had been applied. This index
indicates if an element is originated from a natural or anthropic source. I believe it
would substantially improve the discussion of the data.
Answer: We have amended principal component analysis and discussed
accordingly the source apportionment of PHEs as shown above (response to
Reviewer 1).
The section 3.4 is a bit confusing because the same data was somehow discussed
in the section 3.2.
On lines 50-51 a high coefficient of variation of Cr is related to the discharge of
wastewater; however, on lines 22-23 (page 9) Cr is suggested as being originated
from natural sources. In addition, I am not sure why a high coefficient of variation
would be related to HM enrichment from anthropogenic sources. I understand
coefficient of variation (ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) simply like a
measure of dispersion; and not necessarily with HM enrichment. Besides, except pH,
all variables showed very high coefficient of variation. Are we talking about the same
coefficient of variation??? It is not clear in the material and methods. Moreover, Cr
content in most samples is under background value (Figure 5c) and not “over” as
described on line 48 (page 10).
Answer: These have been revised and rephrased to avoid possible misleading.
13
Not sure what “region-dependent characteristic of heavy metal pollution” does
mean (lines 3-4; page 11).
Answer: We intended to mean the heavy metal pollution is region dependent.
I am very surprised with the statement on lines 6-9 (page 11). There is no
discussion about the data on table 3.
Answer: We have added discussion to Table 3 (new Table 5).
I strongly recommend a substantial improvement of the discussion. The
discussion should be rewritten in a more careful and detailed way.
Answer: We have re-organized the Results and Discussion section and revised
some related parts according to the Reviewer comments.
6. Conclusions:
The conclusions are very similar to the abstract, i.e. only summarizing the results,
particularly on lines 21-33 (page 11).
Answer: We have revised the Conclusion part by removing some repeating
contents according to the Reviewer comments.
The China Environmental and Technical Requirements for Tea Production was
not cited anywhere before. Where were the standards for soils presented? It does not
make sense to show it only in the conclusions.
Answer: We have given reference to the standards of China Environmental
and Technical Requirements for Tea Production to where it is approperiate in the
main text.
14
The information about 80% of the sampled soils is favorable for tea growth
because acidic conditions, is not clear in the data. No data about alkaline soils is
shown. The pH ranged among 3.6 to 7.3. Moreover, based on the table 1 and figure 2a
it is not possible to confirm the number of 80%. Please clarify this information and be
sure that the main conclusions are described and not the results/discussion is repeated.
Answer: We have rephrased this interpretation of acidic and alkaline soils.
Instead, we give pH range that is favorable for tea plantation. Yes, it is not possible
to tell from table 1 the exact number of soil samples that are in the pH range of
favorable conditions but it is roughly judgeable from Figure 2a. We also indicate
these numbers in the revised manuscript: 85.5% (65 out of 76).
7. References:
I am not sure why Hakanson is cited as “Amuno, L.” (ref. 33). Please correct this
information.
Answer: Appologies. We have corrected this mistake in the revised manuscript.
8. Figures:
I would suggest modifying the figure 5. It would be interesting if instead of open
circles; samples could be shown with codes or different symbols for each region. For
example using the number of the regions showed on the figure 1. Is that possible? It
would help to see main differences between samples on the graph.
Please add coordinates in the figure 1.
Figure 2 – Please add (a) and (b) to each figure. Please add units in the figure caption
(Figure 3 as well).
Answer: We have revised figures 1 and 2 according to the Reviewer
15
suggestions. However, coding each sampling spots with different symbols will make
the figure confusing, thus we keep using the open circles.
9. Tables:
Please elaborate new tables in a more clear way. Avoid vertical lines.
Table 3 – your data should come at first. Please change the position.
Answer: We have revised Tables in the revised manuscript.
10. Additional comments:
Abstract:
Overall English writing style should be improved.
-15: It sounds as HM, organic matter and pH were analyzed by
geostatistical approaches. Actually GIS maps show the distribution of the data, but
HM and the other parameters were not measured through this tool. Please rewrite this
sentence.
Answer: We have rephrased this sentence to avoid misleading.
Lines 24-27: Please avoid references in the abstract. Perhaps replace “Hakanson
method” by “ecological potential risk index (RI)” and then, in the next sentence,
simply use “RI”.
t, line numbering is strange. Numbers do not follow lines
correctly. Please check it.
Answer: The line numbers were added by the online submission system.
Introduction:

d “organic matters” to “organic matter” throughout the
document.
Unfortunately I could not find this information on the “Instruction to authors”
document.
Answer: Applogies. We have corrected the mis-formatted reference, as well as
the other details specified by the Reviewer.

targets has been successfully achieved” to “This study aimed to…”, “In order to
evaluate heavy metal enrichment” or something similar.

Reviewer #4:
1. In the whole text the author should be replace “heavy metals” with “potentially
harmful elements”. This is the most suitable lettering to indicate the heavy metals and
the other harmful elements.
Answer: the “heavy metals” in the article has been replaced with “potentially
harmful elements (PHEs)”.
2. Some language improvements (both style and grammar) are also required. The
paper needs to be edited by an English mother language person. Some typos occur.
Answer: We have tried our best to avoid typos and syntex errors and polished the
manuscript with the help of Prof. Christopher Rensing (native speaker).
3. Abstract
Normally, the Abstract should briefly describe the work discussed in the paper
giving information about sampling procedure, adopted analytic methods, and give a
concise summary of the findings. The Abstract should better re-organized; it should
describe better the objectives of the work and give the most important information
about research carried out.
The authors should indicate the width of the study area in which the soil samples have
been collected.
The authors should avoid including the numerical results in the Abstract.
Answer: We have revised accordingly each part as suggested by the Reviewer.
Only key numerical results remain in the revised manuscript, both in the Abstract
and Conclusion.
4. 1. Introduction
19
The Introduction appears too general, it should introduce the subject of the paper
in a more concrete way referring to the importance to assess the distribution of soil
potentially harmful elements for human and ecological risks and to use geostatistics
for their spatial patterns.
This could be addressed providing several recent references to substantiate the
claim made in the thesis of paper (that is, provide references to other groups who do
or have done research in this area). For example, good surveys can be found here:
• Guagliardi I., Cicchella D., De Rosa R., Ricca N., Buttafuoco G., 2018.

Answer: We have revised the Introduction accordingly to all Reviewer
comments, as well as balancing the professional knowledge present and readability
for a wide readership of RSOS journal.
The authors should modify the indication of the references “…and co-workers” in
“…et al.”.
Answer: We have rephrased these parts according to the Reviewer comments.
20
2.1 Description of study area
In this paragraph, the geological setting of the study area is completely missing.
It is fundamental indicating the parent materials of the area to better understand the
composition of soil.
As well as, it is useful better describing the type of soils occurring in the study
area.
It is necessary include a geological map of the study area with the indication of
the lithotypes present in order to compare the possible natural input of elements in the
soil.
Answer: We have provided relevant background information about soil types,
mineral resources in the study area in Section 2.1.
Moreover, which are the anthropogenic activities (including main road networks,
industries) present in the study area that could influence the distribution of the
potentially harmful elements?
Answer: Appologies. We are not able to obtain and figure these information
from map since most tea plantations are located in the mountains. Furthermore,
after applying Kriging spatial interpolation the interpretation of Pb element has
been revised. The previous conclusion related to possible traffic network has also
been deleted.
2.2 Soil sampling
How large the study area is? Are only 78 topsoil samples collected enough to
cover the study area? The authors should justify this choice.
Answer: Most of the tea gardens at An’xi county are planted with oolong tea.
21
The cultivation and growing patterns, as well as the geological are quite similar.
Besides, the area of tea garden is ca. 260 km2 which counts for 8.5% of the whole
county, and is only 7.5% of another You’Xi county, as in our previous paper for
which 93 samples were collected (Geoderma 310 (2018) 99–106, Doi:
10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.09.016). Thus we believe 78 soil samples can be adequate
to cover this study area.
2.3 Physical and chemical analysis
There is no mention of precision and accuracy about quality control analysis.
Which are the detection limits of elements for each analytical methods?
Answer: A new Table (1) has been added to the revised manuscript, showing
the precision, accuracy and limits of elements of each analytical methods applied in
this study.
2.4 Data analysis
This section is quite scarce: it lacks of the description of the main assumptions.
There is a substantial error: the inverse distance weighting (IDW) used by authors is a
geometric method and not a geostatistical one. The authors should give more details
about deterministic method adopted furnishing information on every step of approach
from data transformation to deterministic analysis.
Not all readers of RSOS are necessarily specialists in these topics. If the authors
consider them too obvious, they should refer to previous works in which these issues
are clarified for interested readers.
Answer: We totally agree with the Reviewer. Data analysis has been re-done by
using Kriging spatial interpolation (Ordinary Kriging) method according to the
Reviewer 1. Moreover, extra background references have been provided for a better
22
understanding by a wide readership of the journal.
6. Results and Discussion
My major concern regards this section. About the Discussion, the authors do not
make some important contribution of thought to the paper, but merely summarize
data.
The authors refer to “phosphorus and potassium” and “manganese and copper” as
determined elements but in the previous sections there is no mention about them.
Answer: We have removed these data due to the reason that they are not the core of
the manuscript. Extra emphasis will possibly lead to confusion to readers, as
suggested also by Reviewer #3.
Descriptive statistics are quite poor: Table 1 should include other statistical
parameters to better characterize soil data.
Answer: We have amended Table 1 (new Table 2) by including more statistical
parameters, as suggested.
The error in considering IDW a geostatistical approach is again repeated.
Answer: IDW analysis has been replaced by Kriging spatial interpolation
(Ordinary Kriging), as suggested by Reviewer #1.
The text from line 33 (page 8) to line 29 (page 9) should be moved from
sub-paragraph 3.2 because it is not about the geostatistical analysis of data.
Answer: We have re-arranged these contents to where they are more
approperiate.
23
In which way have been the “soil background values of heavy metals at
provincial and national standards” (line 33/34, page 8) calculated? There is no
mention about references for them.
Answer: We have added reference for provincial and national background
values as new REF 35 and 36.
What are the “calculated standard-reaching rates”? There is no mention about
them before.
Answer: the standard-reaching rates are calculated by dividing the number of
soils with PHEs concentration below background and the total number of samples
collected.
What does the sentence “… overall good condition of heavy metals” (line 6,
page 9) mean?
Answer: This is concluded because most of the studying areas meet the
national standard of Environmental Requirement for Growing Area of Tea (NY-T
853-2004) in China. To be specific, the standard-reaching rate of Hg is 98.7% and
that for other PHEs is 100%, which is considered as an overall good condition of
PHE contamination.
The authors refer to “soil parent materials” for Cr accumulation but they never
approach the geology of the area, so it is difficult for readers understanding which
type of parent materials could influence the presence of Cr.
Answer: These information has been removed from the main text after
applying Kriging spatial interpolation (Ordinary Kriging) instead of IDW, as
suggested by Reviewer #1.
24
What is the “integrate RI” (line 50, page 9)?
Answer: The potential ecological risk index of an individual heavy metal was
replaced with “Er”, and the “integrate RI” was calculated according to the
equation (1) as stated in section 2.5.
What does the sentence “Cd is the characteristic elements in soils when
extensive agricultural activities are applied” (line 16, page 10) mean?
Answer: Cd enters soils through addition of sludge, composts, or fertilizers,
and quite large amount of domestic sewage sludge in An’Xi County is utilized
directly or after resourcing as fertilizers in the tea garden.
7. Conclusions
This section is a mere summary and repetition of parts of previous sections. It is
to be rewritten focusing on more concreteness.
The authors should avoid including the numerical results in the Conclusions.
Answer: We have revised the Conclusion part according to the Reviewer
comments.
8. Figures
In the Fig. 3 the unit of measure is missing.
Answer: We have added units to each element in the revised Figure 3.
Changes are highlighted in yellow background in the main text for clarity.

Reviewer #4:
1. Abstract: I disagree including the numerical results in the Abstract, as well as
in the Conclusions.
Answer: We have excluded the numerical results in both Abstract and
Conclusion, as suggested.
2. Introduction: the authors have not revised the Introduction as suggested. There is
no indication about the suggested references, which are useful especially for the
geostatistical approach adopted.
Answer: Appologize. We have included some of the suggested references that
are closly related to this work in the Introduction section as suggested.
3. Materials and Methods: 2.1 Description of study area: the geological setting of the
study area is still missing, only a very brief and unsatisfactory description of minerals
has been included. There is no reference to addition of geological map.
Answer: We have added the geological map of the study area to Figure 1 in the
revised manuscript.
4. Results and Discussion: connecting to previous suggestion, the authors refer to
“parent materials and pedogenic processes” for Cr accumulation but they did not
approach the geology of the area.
Answer: We have added the geological map, as stated above, and rephrased the
section related to Cr accumulation in the revised manuscript .
