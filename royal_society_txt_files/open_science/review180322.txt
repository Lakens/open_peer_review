Comments to the Author(s)

In this study, a-Fe2O3 and oxalic acid were used for the photo-degradation of aqueous
benzothiazole (BTH). Overall, the experiments were designed comprehensively. The results
showed the almost complete removal of the substrate. However, the discussion was not deep
enough and there is no innovation. The manuscript in the current form is not suitable for
publication and a major revision is required. And the authors should have a good look at the
manuscript before and after submitted. Many details should be noticed and revised very
carefully.
1. Please provide research significance in introduction part.
2. In this work, many details should be written very carefully and correctly, I make some
examples to you as following:
(1). Use spacebar correctly in line 9-10, 41-42, 55-56 in page 3 and so on.
(2). Use typeface correctly in line 3-4 in page 3, line 20-21 in page 4 and line 18-19 in page 5…….
(3). Unify the form of references (line 9-10, page 5 and line 48-49, page 9).
(4). Please explain what the meanings of C0 and Ct are at the first time.
(5). Please combine these two sentences “Clearly, only with a-Fe2O3 or oxalate in the reaction
system, the yield of •OH is much lower as seen from Fig. 1b. When a-Fe2O3 and oxalate are
coexisted, the yield of •OH are markedly increased.” into one sentence like this “… was much
lower than …”.
(6). “Fe3+ s” should be “Fe3+ was” (line 50-51, page 6).
(7). The figures are not showed clearly, please draw them again.
3. Why did the authors use 0.45 µm membrane filter to filter 30 nm a-Fe2O3?
4. Please specifically state the analytical methods of the concentrations of sulfate ion, nitrate ion
and hydroxyl radical in the section of “2. Materials and methods”.
5. Please give some direct evidence to prove the effect of hydroxyl radical, the existence and effect
of superoxide radical. As the authors said in the section of “3.2 Production of hydroxyl radicals
(•OH) in different reaction systems”, it can only prove the existence of hydroxyl radical in the
solution. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometry and radical quenching
experiments will be very useful methods. Good references for the authors: Cheng et al., Water
Research, 113 (2017) 80-88; Qu et al., Water Research, 125 (2017) 114-122; Feng et al., Water
Research, 85 (2015) 1-10.
6. Please discuss more in the sections of “3.1 Photodegradation of BTH in different systems under
UV light irradiation” and “3.5 Effect of the initial pH value on BTH photodegradation”. Is there
any possible that BTH removal efficiency might mainly depend on the form of iron? In pH=2,
iron can be dissolved in the aqueous solution, while it starts to be precipitated at pH=3. If so,
considering that the authors gave the optimum conditions: pH 2.0, a-Fe2O3 dosage 0.2 g L-1
and initial oxlate concentration 2.0 mmol L-1 under 500 W of the UV light irradiation (Hg lamp),
is the effect of the addition of a-Fe2O3 as the same as the iron ion? What is the significance of the
optimum conditions?
7. Additionally, did the authors measure the concentration of leaching metal ions? Please
3
measure the concentrations of leaching metal ions at different pH values (2, 3, 5, 7). How did the
authors make sure that BTH removal is attributed to the effect of a-Fe2O3/oxalic acid instead of
the effect of the leaching iron/oxalic acid? Good reference for the authors: Yao et al., Chemical
Engineering Journal, 330 (2017) 345-354.
8. Did the authors perform the recycle experiments? In this study, does a-Fe2O3 play a role as a
photocatalyst to degrade the pollutant? As we all know, catalyst can be recycled. However, the
authors wrote in the manuscript “Firstly, oxalic acid was adsorbed on the surface of a-Fe2O3
particles, which accelerates the formation of a-Fe2O3/oxalate complexes, [=Fe<U+2162>(C2O4)n]3-2n,
and a part of these complexes are dissolved in the solution…”. So I am confused whether a-
Fe2O3 can be the catalyst or not.
9. How did the authors make sure that BTH could be mineralized thoroughly by monitoring
concentrations of the sulfate ion and nitrate ion? From Fig. 5(b), I can not see that. Furthermore,
in the discussion (line 32-29, page 9), I can not see that, either. Only I can see is BTH was
mineralized into sulfate ion and nitrate ion.
10. Please give the specific experimental conditions in every figure caption.

The manuscript reported the photodegradation of benzothiazole using iron oxides and oxalic
acids under UV light irradiation with a photo-Fenton-like system. Potential photodegradation
pathways and intermediates were also discussed in this paper. The work is interesting and rather
well conducted.
The following points need to be modified or further explained:
1. The goal of present study is to degrade BTH, so in the introduction section, the author should
give a summary on the degradation of BTHs, especially, the difference to the reports that have the
similar mechanisms should be indicated.
2. There were several terms were misused and some de-normalize abbreviations should be
correct.
3. It would be helpful that the author give the results of the other radicals in the reaction period,
which would prove the positivity of the mechanism.

Responses to Reviewers
For Reviewer1:
In this study, a-Fe2O3 and oxalic acid were used for the photo-degradation of aqueous benzothiazole
(BTH). Overall, the experiments were designed comprehensively. The results showed the almost
complete removal of the substrate. However, the discussion was not deep enough and there is no
innovation. The manuscript in the current form is not suitable for publication and a major revision is
required. And the authors should have a good look at the manuscript before and after submitted. Many
details should be noticed and revised very carefully.
1. Please provide research significance in introduction part.
Answer: Thanks for your valuable comments. We have provide the research significance in
introduction part.
2. In this work, many details should be written very carefully and correctly, I make some examples to
you as following:
(1) Use spacebar correctly in line 9-10, 41-42, 55-56 in page 3 and so on.
Answer: Thanks for your valuable comments. The spacebar in the whole manuscript has been
checked carefully and changed in necessary.
(2) Use typeface correctly in line 3-4 in page 3, line 20-21 in page 4 and line 18-19 in page 5…….
Answer: The typeface in the whole manuscript has been checked carefully and corrected.
(3) Unify the form of references (line 9-10, page 5 and line 48-49, page 9).
Answer: The references-style have been formatted according to Author Guide for this journal.
(4) Please explain what the meanings of C0 and Ct are at the first time.
Answer: C0 and Ct are the concentration of BTH in the beginning and a given time t during the
degradation process, and the explanation were also added in “2.4 kinetic study” part of this
manuscript.
(5) Please combine these two sentences “Clearly, only with a-Fe2O3 or oxalate in the reaction system,
the yield of •OH is much lower as seen from Fig. 1b. When a-Fe2O3 and oxalate are coexisted, the
yield of •OH are markedly increased.” into one sentence like this “… was much lower than …”.
Answer: Thanks for your valuable comments. The two sentences have combined as “As shown in
figure1b, the yield of ·OH produced in the system of a-Fe2O3 or oxalate alone is much lower
than that of with coexistence of a-Fe2O3 and oxalate system” (3.2 Part).
(6) “Fe3+ s” should be “Fe3+ was” (line 50-51, page 6).
Answer: Checked and corrected.
(7) The figures are not showed clearly, please draw them again.
Answer: Thanks for your valuable comments, all the figures have been modified.
3. Why did the authors use 0.45 µm membrane filter to filter 30 nm a-Fe2O3?
Answer: Thanks for your valuable comments, the procedure has been re-checked and the sentence also
has been corrected (2.2 Part). In fact, the suspension after withdrawing was firstly
centrifuged at 10000 rpm and then filtered by 0.45 µm membrane filter, the aim of using 0.45
µm membrane filter is to avoid the blocking of the pipeline system and chromatographic
column.
4. Please specifically state the analytical methods of the concentrations of sulfate ion, nitrate ion and
hydroxyl radical in the section of “2. Materials and methods”.
Answer: Thanks for your valuable comments. The analysis of the concentrations of sulfate ion and
nitrate ion were performed according to standard methods proposed by PRC State
Environmental Protection Administration, and determination of hydroxyl radical was
conducted using the <U+02D9>OH quenching experiments. We have stated the procedures in detail
(2.3 Part), and the references were also added.
5. Please give some direct evidence to prove the effect of hydroxyl radical, the existence and effect of
superoxide radical. As the authors said in the section of “3.2 Production of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in
different reaction systems”, it can only prove the existence of hydroxyl radical in the solution. Electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometry and radical quenching experiments will be very useful
methods. Good references for the authors: Cheng et al., Water Research, 113 (2017) 80-88; Qu et al.,
Water Research, 125 (2017) 114-122; Feng et al., Water Research, 85 (2015) 1-10.
Answer: Thanks for your valuable comments, EPR is really a useful method for hydroxyl radical
analysis and will be adopted in our further researches, but here we just use the quenching
experiments to roughly estimate the concentration of •OH. In the section of “3.2 Production of
hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in different reaction systems”, the effect of hydroxyl radical was added.
Furthermore, reference (Feng et al., Water Research, 85 (2015) 1-10.) was also added in the
article (Reference 23) for further discussion.
6. Please discuss more in the sections of “3.1 Photodegradation of BTH in different systems under UV
light irradiation” and “3.5 Effect of the initial pH value on BTH photodegradation”. Is there any
possible that BTH removal efficiency might mainly depend on the form of iron? In pH=2, iron can be
dissolved in the aqueous solution, while it starts to be precipitated at pH=3. If so, considering that the
authors gave the optimum conditions: pH 2.0, a-Fe2O3 dosage 0.2 g L-1 and initial oxlate concentration
2.0 mmol L-1 under 500 W of the UV light irradiation (Hg lamp), is the effect of the addition of
a-Fe2O3 as the same as the iron ion? What is the significance of the optimum conditions?
Answer: Thanks for your valuable comments. In the sections of “3.1 Photodegradation of BTH in
different systems under UV light irradiation” and “3.5 Effect of the initial pH value on BTH
photodegradation” more discussion was added. The significance of the optimum conditions is
to “define the best conditions to improve the BTH degradation in the heterogeneous system
composed of iron oxides and oxalic acid”.
7. Additionally, did the authors measure the concentration of leaching metal ions? Please measure the
concentrations of leaching metal ions at different pH values (2, 3, 5, 7). How did the authors make sure
that BTH removal is attributed to the effect of a-Fe2O3/oxalic acid instead of the effect of the leaching
iron/oxalic acid? Good reference for the authors: Yao et al., Chemical Engineering Journal, 330 (2017)
345-354.
Answer: Thanks for your valuable comments. In the heterogeneous photo-Fenton-like system
composed of a-Fe2O3/oxalate under UV irradiation, concentration of leaching metal ions
depend on pH and the concentration of oxalate. And there are different iron species (Fe3+<U+3001>
Fe2+<U+3001>Fe<U+2162>(C2O4)n]3-2n<U+3001>Fe<U+2161>(C2O4)n-1]4-2n, et al)with large discrepancy in the system. Among
these iron species, “[=Fe<U+2162>(C2O4)n]3-2n on the a-Fe2O3 particle surface and in the solution
both possessed high photochemical activity”.
8. Did the authors perform the recycle experiments? In this study, doesa-Fe2O3 play a role as a
photocatalyst to degrade the pollutant? As we all know, catalyst can be recycled. However, the authors
wrote in the manuscript “Firstly, oxalic acid was adsorbed on the surface of a-Fe2O3 particles, which
accelerates the formation of a-Fe2O3/oxalate complexes, [=Fe<U+2162>(C2O4)n]3-2n, and a part of these
complexes are dissolved in the solution…”. So I am confused whether a-Fe2O3 can be the catalyst or
not.
Answer: A heterogeneous photo-Fenton-like system could be set up in the system of a-Fe2O3/oxalate
under UV irradiation, in which “[=Fe<U+2162>(C2O4)n]3-2n on the a-Fe2O3 particle surface and in the
solution both possessed high photochemical activity”, as is described in the article.
9. How did the authors make sure that BTH could be mineralized thoroughly by monitoring
concentrations of the sulfate ion and nitrate ion? From Fig. 5(b), I can not see that. Furthermore, in the
discussion (line 32-29, page 9), I can not see that, either. Only I can see is BTH was mineralized into
sulfate ion and nitrate ion.
Answer: Thanks for your valuable comments. In the section of “3.6 Identification of the
photodegradation intermediates and products”, the explaination of concentrations of the sulfate
ion and nitrate ion has modified.
10. Please give the specific experimental conditions in every figure caption.
Answer: Thanks for your valuable comments, we gave the specific experimental conditions in every
figure caption.
