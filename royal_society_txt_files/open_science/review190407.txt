The Manuscript (RSOS-190407) entitled “Kinetic study of catalytic CO2 hydration by
metalsubstituted biomimetic carbonic anhydrase model complexes " by Lee et al. described the
the synthesis of model complexes with tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPA) and using various
transition metals (Zn2+, Cu2+ and Ni2+) to control the intrinsic proton-donating ability. The
effect of pKa on the CO2 hydration rate was investigated by stopped-flow spectrophotometry.
The manuscript is interesting piece of work and is well written. I would like to recommend
publication after major revision for the following reasons.
(1) The data in the manuscript were not enough to tell a interesting and complete story. Instead of
putting data into different papers so to publish more papers, one really should tell a complete
and interesting story with enough data, solid evidence and plausible reasoning.
(2)The way to put those data together and to analyze the data is pretty routine and boring.
(3)The authors might to answer following questions when writing the manuscript:
What is something new and exciting about the manuscript? New observations? New findings?
New theory or mechanism? What would be major impact to the people working in the field?

The manuscript (ID: RSOS-190407), title “Kinetic study of catalytic CO2 hydration by metal-
substituted biomimetic carbonic anhydrase model complexes” is very interesting and suitable for
3
publication. The synthesized complexes were characterized and their use to mimic carbonic
anhydrase was carefully discussed. The work is well described and will add knowledge to the
scientific area.

Appendix A
Dear Editor:
I wish to submit a research paper for publication in Royal Society Open Science, titled “Kinetic study
of catalytic CO2 hydration by metal-substituted biomimetic carbonic anhydrase model complexes.”
The paper was coauthored by Man sig Lee. This manuscript was also proposed to be submitted to
Royal Society Open Science by RSC Advances.
This study investigated the effect of the metal ion on the CO2 hydration rates of [(TPA)M(OH2)]2+
[M = Zn, Cu, Ni; TPA = tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine] complexes that mimic carbonic anhydrase. Water
deprotonation is the rate-determining step of the zinc-containing enzyme or model complex.
However, kinetic and pKa studies showed that owing to the lower pKa of the Cu and Ni complexes,
bicarbonate release becomes rate determining and the reaction rate decreases. We believe that our
findings significantly contribute to an understanding of the mechanism of CO2 hydration by
biomimetic complexes and factors that influence their catalytic activity.
Further, we believe that this paper would be suitable to your journal because it presents a
fundamental study on an important reaction that is highly relevant to the development of
approaches to mitigate the increasing CO2 level in the atmosphere. Thus, we anticipate that this
paper would be of interest not only to physical and inorganic chemists, but also environmental
scientists.
This manuscript has not been published or presented elsewhere in part or in entirety and is not
under consideration by another journal. We have read and understood your journal’s policies, and
we believe that neither the manuscript nor the study violates any of these. There are no conflicts of
interest to declare.
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

(1) The data in the manuscript were not enough to tell a interesting and complete story. Instead
of putting data into different papers so to publish more papers, one really should tell a
complete and interesting story with enough data, solid evidence and plausible reasoning.
- We have added a variety of papers to support our work and have made ample reasoning
possible.
(2)The way to put those data together and to analyze the data is pretty routine and boring.
- Since the carbon dioxide hydration of the carbonic anhydrase model complexes is very rapid,
we measured the rate using stopped-flow spectrophotometry and tried to explain the results
interestingly with pKa.
(3)The authors might to answer following questions when writing the manuscript:
What is something new and exciting about the manuscript? New observations? New findings?
New theory or mechanism? What would be major impact to the people working in the field?
- We observed that the model complexes synthesized with Zn show higher pKa than the Cu
and Ni complexes. Therefore, Zn model compound is expected to have slower carbon dioxide
hydration rates than other metals, but the fastest hydration reaction was measured. This
revealed that the Zn model compound is a slow reaction in the deprotonation step and this
step is the rate determining step.
Our study suggests that when synthesizing and designing CA model compounds, Zn ions
should be used instead of other metals and synthesized considering not only the active sites
coordinated to Zn but also the secondary coordination structure.
