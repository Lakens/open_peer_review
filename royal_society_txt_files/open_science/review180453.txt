This is an interesting and well-written take on the problem of offspring size of fish. In general it is
methodologically sound. An exception is the definition of fitness, which is incomplete (see
below). This issue is critical, and its needs to be highlighted to alert the reader to the limitations of
the analysis.
The work would benefit from an analysis of actual growth and death rates and their ratio, in
particular whether there are differences between chondrichthyes and teleosts.
Line 46. Why tuna? From the first paragraph I though this was about teleosts and chondrichthyes
generally, and not about a specific taxa.
Line 60-63 + 74-77. Survival is not the same as fitness. Fitness emerges from a combination of
survival and adult reproductive output, typically the product of the two. That problem is
countered by Line 80 that say that maternal resources are fixed (I assume that it is adult lifetime
reproductive output which is fixed, not just maternal resources). However, that would be
atypical. For instance, if the juvenile death rate changes, the adult death rate would typically
change similarly. Likewise for growth rates; if juvenile grow fast, adult would typically also have
a larger investment in reproduction. The assumption that adult reproductive output is fixed is
therefore stretched. This caveat on the analysis needs to be highlighted, and the consequences
discussed.
If death rate is larger than the growth rate then cohort biomass will decrease as the individuals
grow. Unless the ratio of growth to death rates suddenly changes for adults to compensate for the
decrease in cohort biomass, fitness will be less than one, and the population cannot be viable.
This problem is related to the above issue, but is more serious, because it indicates that the results
related to selection for larger offspring size is an artefact of ignoring the adult reproductive
output. The reader needs to be alerted to this issue, and the condition that the ratio between
growth (actually energy acquisition) and mortality must be reversed for adults for evolution to be
able to select for larger offspring. Perhaps this is what happens for chondrichthyes? Note that it is
not just that mortality must be smaller for adults, it is the ratio between growth and mortality
which must be above 1 (and sufficiently so to compensate for the loss of biomass in the juvenile
cohorts).

ontogenetic niche and species interactions in size-structured populations." Annual review of
ecology and systematics 15.1 (1984): 393-425.
Line 243. “We presume that minimum egg size somehow reflects the needs to fuel embryonic
development while excreting salts and curtailing water loss in the oceans” — but how can
copepods then make even smaller eggs?

supply nutrition to eggs “. Are there really no marine viviparous fish?

This is an interesting and well-written take on the problem of offspring size of fish.
In general it is methodologically sound. An exception is the definition of fitness,
which is incomplete (see below). This issue is critical, and its needs to be highlighted
to alert the reader to the limitations of the analysis.
We thank the reviewer for his comments and address this issue below.
The work would benefit from an analysis of actual growth and death rates and their
ratio, in particular whether there are differences between chondrichthyes and
teleosts.
We agree and searched the literature diligently for such data but failed to find
any.
Line 46. Why tuna? From the first paragraph I though this was about teleosts and
chondrichthyes generally, and not about a specific taxa.
Technically the referee is correct, but from the outset we use tuna and shark as
shorthand for teleosts and chondrichthyes – as in the title and Abstract. We
believe this approach will appeal to readers.
Line 60-63 + 74-77. Survival is not the same as fitness. Fitness emerges from a
combination of survival and adult reproductive output, typically the product of the
two. This is correct. Our approach is to use net reproductive rate as our measure
of fitness as described in lines 68-77.
That problem is countered by Line 80 that say that maternal resources are fixed (I
assume that it is adult lifetime reproductive output which is fixed, not just maternal
resources). No, we do not assume that adult lifetime reproductive output is fixed,
it is maternal resources each time the adult breeds that are assumed to be fixed.
We have rewritten line 80 to make this clearer.
However, that would be atypical. For instance, if the juvenile death rate changes,
the adult death rate would typically change similarly. Likewise for growth rates; if
juvenile grow fast, adult would typically also have a larger investment in
reproduction. These are additional life-history trade-offs whose analysis is beyond
the scope of this paper and which we are currently working on. The assumption
that adult reproductive output is fixed is therefore stretched. This caveat on the
analysis needs to be highlighted, and the consequences discussed. In the light of our
responses above we do not consider further discussion here to be warranted.
If death rate is larger than the growth rate then cohort biomass will decrease as the
individuals grow. Unless the ratio of growth to death rates suddenly changes for
adults to compensate for the decrease in cohort biomass, fitness will be less than
one, and the population cannot be viable. This is true in our model and is analysed
in Fig. 2c. The result of the analysis is that the optimal strategy when death rate is
larger than growth rate is to produce a single offspring of the largest possible size.
Other strategies do then have fitness less than one and are not viable. This is what
the analysis shows, and is not a problem but a result. This problem is related to the
above issue, but is more serious, because it indicates that the results related to
selection for larger offspring size is an artefact of ignoring the adult reproductive
output. The reader needs to be alerted to this issue, and the condition that the ratio
between growth (actually energy acquisition) and mortality must be reversed for
adults for evolution to be able to select for larger offspring. Perhaps this is what
happens for chondrichthyes? Note that it is not just that mortality must be smaller
for adults, it is the ratio between growth and mortality which must be above 1 (and
sufficiently so to compensate for the loss of biomass in the juvenile cohorts). This is
indeed what we suggest happens in chondrichthyes, the key analysis is shown in
Fig. 3b.
Line 183-186. I believe that this result was derived by Werner, Earl E., and James F.
Gilliam. "The ontogenetic niche and species interactions in size-structured
populations." Annual review of ecology and systematics 15.1 (1984): 393-425.
This is an interesting paper but we do not find in it any of the results in our paper.
Line 243. “We presume that minimum egg size somehow reflects the needs to fuel
embryonic development while excreting salts and curtailing water loss in the
oceans” — but how can copepods then make even smaller eggs? We have changed
the text to read “We presume that minimum egg size somehow reflects the
volume of the zygote required to contain the genetic material, fuel for embryonic
development, and related machinery and compounds. The marine teleost zygotes
must contain the materials for excreting salts and curtailing water loss in the
oceans.” The case of other taxa such as copepods is interesting but we feel it is
beyond the scope of this paper.
Line 246: “No marine lineages have gone farther than having males protect and
sometimes supply nutrition to eggs “. Are there really no marine viviparous fish?
We agree this seems suprising but to the best of our knowledge it is true of the
marine, but not freshwater teleosts. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live-
bearing_aquarium_fish. This highlights the importance of metabolic and
phylogenetic constraints in the evolution and life history of marine fishes.
The discussion of “historical constraints” is a fine description of the evolutionary
history of fish, how
In addition we have corrected some typos in the original text and made some
further clarifications. These can all be seen in the version of the resubmitted ms in

11 Abstract
12
13 Teleosts such as tunas and billfish lay millions of tiny eggs weighing on the order of
14 0.001 g, whereas chondrichthyes such as sharks and rays produce a few eggs or live
15 offspring weighing about 2% of adult body mass, as much as 10,000 g in some
16 species. Why are the strategies so extreme, and why are intermediate ones absent?
17 Building on previous work we show quantitatively how offspring size reflects the
18 relationship between growth and death rates. We construct fitness contours as
19 functions of offspring size and number, and show how these can be derived from
20 juvenile growth and survivorship curves. Convex contours, corresponding to Pearl
21 Type 1 and 2 survivorship curves, select for extremes, either miniscule or large
22 offspring; concave contours select for offspring of intermediate size. Of particular
23 interest are what we call critical straight-line fitness contours, corresponding to log-
24 linear Pearl Type 3 survivorship curves, which separate regimes that select for
25 opposite optimal offspring sizes.

27 Keywords: Optimal offspring size; ESS; fish reproductive strategies; number-size
28 tradeoff; Pearl survivorship curve
29 Introduction
30 A fundamental tradeoff in life history is how overall reproductive effort is
31 allocated to produce either many small or a few large offspring (e.g., [1-3]. An
32 especially dramatic example in animals is afforded by marine fish, which exhibit one
33 of the two extreme reproductive strategies while the size of offspring varies by at
34 least 7 orders of magnitude (Fig. 1). The large teleosts (bony fishes that include
35 tunas, billfish, marine sunfish, and groupers) have external fertilization and produce
36 enormous numbers of tiny eggs that hatch out as free-living larvae [4-7] Anderson
37 et al. 2016). Teleost egg size averages about 1 mg and is only very weakly correlated
38 with adult body size. The chondrichthyes (cartilaginous sharks, rays, and chimeras)
39 and the “living fossil” coelacanth have internal fertilization and produce a relatively
40 small number of relatively large offspring, either large, well-protected eggs or live-
41 born young. The size of newborn chondrichthyes scales positively and is on average
42 2% adult body mass (range 0.01-15%, Fig. 1, [7-11]Andersen et al. 2016; Andersen et
43 al. 2008; Duarte and Alcaraz 1989; Elgar 1990; Neuheimer et al. 2015). Some large
44 sharks give birth to live offspring weighing more than 10,000 g.
2
45 So, a challenging question is how have these two groups of marine fish, with
46 such contrasting life histories, been able to occur together for about 200 million
47 years in many different marine habitats. This question has been the subject of
48 repeated investigation [3, 5, 7, 11-16]. Producing large, well-developed offspring can
49 be viewed as a form of parental care, and hypotheses to explain the well-
50 documented correlation between parental care and propagule size in animals have
51 focused on how mortality rates of offspring vary with their size [15]. Computer
52 simulations of foraging suggest that the many-small tuna strategy does best when
53 prey are abundant and clumped [5]. This led to the suggestion that the teleost
54 explosion was driven by the concurrent evolution of the copepods, which provided a
55 rich food source for their numerous, tiny larvae [12]. Using simple assumptions from
56 metabolic scaling theory about the size-dependence of growth and death rates [7,
57 11] showed that ordinarily the tuna strategy is best, but if death rate becomes
58 increasingly density-dependent with increasing juvenile size, this may give the
59 advantage to a shark strategy, leading to the observed positive correlation between
60 the sizes of offspring and adults.
61 Existing theory and data beg the question of why the shark-tuna dichotomy
62 represents two alternative evolutionary stable strategies. The long history of
63 coexistence of diverse chondrichthyes and teleosts suggests that the extreme few-
64 large and many-small offspring strategies are approximately equally fit, whereas
65 intermediate strategies are absent because they have been selected against. In this
66 paper, we show how fitness contours can be obtained directly from juvenile growth
67 and survivorship curves, and build upon earlier studies to obtain more general
68 results showing how the shark and tuna strategies, with either a few, large or many
69 small offspring, can confer equal fitness. We follow others in assuming the existence
70 of an allocation trade-off such that the product of offspring size and number is fixed.
71 When this assumption holds we show that when the death rate of juveniles exceeds
72 the growth rate, the shark strategy is fitter because more offspring to survive to
73 adulthood, but when growth rate exceeds death rate, the tuna strategy is superior
74 because some out of the enormous number of tiny offspring grow fast enough to
75 survive to adulthood.
76
77 How fitness contours select for initial offspring size
78 In this section we characterise the optimal reproductive strategy in terms of
79 offspring size and number. The action of selection is investigated by calculating the
80 fitness consequences of reproductive options. Net reproductive rate, R0, is used as
81 the underlying measure of fitness, and it is assumed that populations using the
82 optimal strategy are in steady state at R0 = 1 [17, 18]. We do not consider here how
83 density-dependence maintains the population at steady state but assume implicitly
84 this is achieved by adjustments of the components of R0 (‘ecological compensation’
85 [19]). In simple iteroparous life histories in which fecundity n is the same each time
86 an individual breeds, juvenile survivorship is Sj and adult survivorship between
87 reproductive events is Sa; net reproductive rate is given by R0 = nSj (1 + Sa + Sa2 + Sa3
88 + … ). In the analysis that follows we are only interested in life history options from
89 birth until the offspring reach a certain size mL, so we assume Sa and survivorship
3
90 from mL to adult size are both fixed and use the number of offspring that survive
91 from each breeding event to size mL as our operational fitness measure.
92 We follow previous analyses in evaluating how the optimal reproductive
93 strategy reflects a trade-off between offspring size and offspring number (see, e.g.,
94 [1-3]. In describing the model we assume that maternal resources each time the
95 adult breeds are fixed and there is an allocation trade-off between number, N0, and
96 size, m0, of offspring such that total biomass, N0 m0, is constant. O, though our
97 results do not depend critically on this specific form of the trade-off. On logarithmic
98 axes the constraint that N0 m0 is constant appears as a straight line with slope = -1,
99 as illustrated by the red lines in Fig. 2, and the possible maternal strategies are
100 points along these red lines. We ask how the optimal strategy depends on the
101 growth and death rates of juveniles. We choose to work in terms of per capita death
102 rates, d, and relative growth rates, g, which are rates of growth per unit mass. Both
103 d and g are given per unit time, which will commonly be year-1. We assume that
104 juvenile growth and death rates both depend only on juvenile body mass, m.
105 We write expressions in terms of natural logarithms (base e), using
106 subscripts S and L to indicate the extreme strategies: either many-small or few-large
107 offspring. So the smallest possible offspring size is mS, and the largest possible, if
108 only one is produced, is mL. For the present discussion we define juveniles as
109 individuals of any size greater than mS but less than mL. We write x = logem and y =
110 logeN. In these terms the possible maternal strategies are the points x0, y0 on the red
111 lines in Fig. 2.
112 Consider the fate of N0 juveniles of initial mass m0. If their per capita death
113 rate when they are of size x is d(x), then:-
114 The number surviving from size x0 to x, is N = N0 exp(- <U+222B> <U+0001D451>(<U+0001D465>)<U+0001D451><U+0001D461>),
115 (1a)
116 where the integration runs from the time when the initial size is x0 to when size is x.
1 <U+0001D451><U+0001D45A> <U+0001D451><U+0001D465>
117 The relative growth rate, , is equal to , let this be written g(x). Substituting for
<U+0001D45A> <U+0001D451><U+0001D461> <U+0001D451><U+0001D461>
118 dt in equation (1) gives:-
<U+0001D465> <U+0001D451>(<U+0001D465>)
119 The number surviving from size x0 to x, is N = N0 exp(- <U+222B><U+0001D465> <U+0001D451><U+0001D465> ).
0 <U+0001D454>(<U+0001D465>)
120 (1b)
<U+0001D465> <U+0001D451>(<U+0001D465>)
121 i.e., y = y0 - <U+222B><U+0001D465> <U+0001D451><U+0001D465>
0 <U+0001D454>(<U+0001D465>)
122 (1c)
123 Since the logarithm of the number of offspring surviving to the largest possible size
124 mL is our operational measure of fitness, F = yL, we can substitute this and rearrange
125 equation 1c, to obtain:
<U+0001D465> <U+0001D451>(<U+0001D465>)
126 y0 = F + <U+222B><U+0001D465> <U+0001D43F> <U+0001D451><U+0001D465> .
0 <U+0001D454>(<U+0001D465>)
127 (2)
128 Equation 2 can be used to plot fitness contours, showing the fitness of x0, y0
129 strategies, as in Fig. 2b and c and Fig. 3. Selection favours evolutionary change
130 perpendicular to the fitness contours, but the options are constrained to lie on the
131 red tradeoff line. Fig. 2 shows the conditions when the ratio of death rate to growth
132 rate remains constant over offspring size. If the relative growth rate, g, is greater
4
133 than the death rate, d, then the smallest-size strategy S is fitter, because the fitness
134 contours have shallower slope than the reproductive options (black lines shallower
135 than red line in Fig. 2b). The net result is evolution along the red line towards S.
136 Conversely if death rate of juveniles is greater than the growth rate, then the
137 largest-size strategy L is fitter, as in Fig. 2c.
138 If death rate and/or growth rate change with increasing offspring size, then
139 fitness may reach a minimum or maximum at an intermediate position on the
140 constraint line as shown in Fig. 3. If the death rate shifts from being greater to lower
141 than the growth rate as juvenile size increases, then the fitness contours are
142 concave and optimal strategy is to produce offspring of intermediate size as in Fig.
143 3b. Conversely, if growth rate is higher than the death rate at the smallest sizes but
144 this reverses as juvenile size increases, then the fitness contours are convex and
145 optimal strategy is to produce offspring of one or the other of the extreme sizes as
146 in Fig. 3d.
147
148 Fitness contours have the same shapes as mass-abundance curves
149 Until now we have considered the fitness consequences of the mother producing
150 some combination of number and size of offspring, and we have seen how the
151 optimal strategy depends on the shape of the fitness contours in a space with axes
152 the number and size of offspring. In broad terms the conclusion is that optimal
153 offspring size depends on how growth and death rates vary as the offspring
154 develops. But how growth and death rates vary over ontogeny is also key to the
155 characterisation of life histories. Life histories have traditionally been described by
156 survivorship and growth curves, plotting the logarithm of survivorship as a function
157 of age, and body mass as a function of age respectively. Pearl (1928) plotted
158 survivorship as a function of age and categorized the empirical curves into
159 qualitative “types” based on their shapes. Here we are concerned only with
160 survivorship and growth of juveniles (i.e., from hatching or birth until the age of first
161 reproduction). The slope of the log survivorship curve is the per capita death rate,
162 and the slope of a log body mass curve is the relative growth rate. In the following
163 sections we will show that since both survivorship and growth curves are functions
164 of age, age can be factored out, allowing us to express the number of surviving
165 offspring as a function of their individual body masses, as in Fig. 4. This enables us to
166 obtain what we term mass-abundance curves. Mass-abundance curves have the
167 same shapes as fitness contours, because they were generated by the same death
168 and growth functions (see SEM for formal proof). So the convex Type 1 curve in Fig.
169 4 has the same shape as the fitness contours in Fig. 3d, and the concave Type 3
170 curve has the same shape as the contours in Fig. 3b.
171
172 Inferring fitness contours from juvenile growth and survivorship curves
173 Mass-abundance curves can be constructed from juvenile survivorship and growth
174 curves in relation to age. This is because the growth curve gives body mass as a
175 function of age, so the inverse function gives age in relation to body mass, and this
176 allows survivorship to be rewritten as a function of body mass. A worked example is
5
177 given in Fig. 5. Although our results are general, for realism as well as ease of
178 exposition we assume the growth curves are of Bertalanffy type, an example is
179 shown in Fig. 5b.
180 Of the types of survivorship curves designated by Pearl ([20]1928; Fig. 5a)
181 three are relevant to juvenile survivorship considered here: log linear (Pearl Type 2),
182 where the per capita death rate is constant, independent of age; convex (Pearl Type
183 1), where death rate is low initially and increases with age; and concave (Pearl Type
184 3), where death rate is high initially and decreases with age. Together, growth and
185 survivorship curves determine the shape of mass abundance curves, as shown in the
186 right hand panel of Fig. 5. Important here is the consideration that the survivorship
187 curves might theoretically be any of the three types (death rate independent of age
188 or high early or late in ontogeny), depending on the causes of mortality in the
189 environment. By contrast, Bertalanffy and other realistic growth curves are
190 constrained by physiology so that growth rate decreases with age and converges to
191 zero as adult size is approached. This is indicated by the spacing between the points
192 representing equal time intervals in Fig 5b.
193 To see how the growth and survivorship curves determine the shape of
194 mass abundance curves, note that the points in Fig. 5 are plotted at consecutive
195 time intervals. There is a large increase in the logarithm of mass in the first time
196 interval (Fig. 5b) and the first two points in the mass abundance plot are horizontally
197 displaced by an equivalent distance (Fig. 5c). The decrease in survivorship in the first
198 time interval is small for the blue points (type 1) but large for the purple points (type
199 3b) (Fig. 5a). The vertical displacements in Fig. 5c are the same as those in Fig. 5a. In
200 this way the displacements in Fig. 5a and b determine the vector displacements in
201 Fig. 5c. The net effects of growth and death rates determine the mass abundance
202 curves. If growth exceeds death rate the mass abundance curve – and the
203 corresponding fitness contour, see previous section – is shallow. If death exceeds
204 growth rate the mass abundance curve is steep. Where growth and death rates are
205 equal throughout ontogeny the mass abundance curve and the corresponding
206 fitness contour are straight lines.
207 SStraight-line fitness contours – and the corresponding to the straight mass
208 abundance curves in Fig. 5c, – are of special interest because they separate convex
209 from concave contours, and these have opposite selective consequences, as
210 discussed earlier. What determines the shape of the critical straight fitness contour
211 that separates the two selective regimes? Straight fitness contours occur when the
212 survivorship curve (Type 3a in Fig. 5a) is the exact inverse or mirror image of the
213 growth curve (Fig. 5b). This occurs when growth and death rates are equal
214 throughout ontogeny; as relative body mass increases, per capita survivorship
215 decreases by exactly the same amount.
216
217 Discussion
218 Our key results are that 1) Convex fitness contours select for extreme strategies,
219 either many-small or few-large offspring (Fig. 3d), whereas concave contours select
220 for offspring of intermediate size (Fig. 3b). 2) Straight-line fitness contours as in Fig.
221 5c are of special interest because they separate convex from concave contours, and
6
222 from regimes which select for opposite strategies. 3) Fitness contours are identical
223 to mass-abundance curves which express the abundance of surviving offspring as a
224 function of their body masses. Mass-abundance curves can be derived from juvenile
225 growth and survivorship curves. 4) The critical straight-line fitness contours occur
226 when survivorship curves are mirror images of growth curves. When growth curves
227 are known or can be assumed theoretically, this allows construction of critical
228 survivorship curves, separating selective regimes with opposite consequences. Our
229 results depend on the assumption of an allocation trade-off such that the product of
230 offspring size and number is fixed, and will need modification if the trade-off takes
231 another form.
232 To predict the selective consequences for offspring size we invert the
233 growth curve to generate the critical Type 3a survivorship curve shown in Fig. 5a. If
234 reported survivorship curves are more curved than this as in Type 3b, then
235 intermediate offspring size is predicted. This is because very small offspring would
236 experience death rates higher than growth rates, and the optimal maternal strategy
237 is to allocate maternal resources to a smaller number of larger offspring. Conversely
238 if the reported survivorship curve is less curved than the critical 3a survivorship
239 curve, or convex as in Type 1, then offspring sizes should be extreme, either as small
240 or as large as possible. So to predict selective consequences we need to compare
241 juvenile growth and survivorship curves.
242 Juvenile growth and survivorship curves are shown in Fig. 6 for mackerel
243 (Scomber scombrus) from egg to first breeding at one year old. The inverted growth
244 curve (broken red line) represents the critical Pearl Type 3a survivorship curve. The
245 real survivorship curve is less concave than the critical curve, meaning that selection
246 favours an extreme strategy, here eggs as small and numerous as possible.
247 We have shown that the critical Pearl Type 3A survivorship curve has special
248 importance (Fig. 5). It represents a threshold, separating selection regimes that
249 favour either extreme or intermediate strategies. Its parameters are derived from
250 those of the growth curve, as shown in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6 the growth curve is of
251 Gompertz type, but the critical Pearl survivorship curve can always be derived by
252 simply inverting the appropriate growth curve. These very general results hold
253 because mass-abundance curves and juvenile survivorship and growth curves are
254 inextricably linked. If any two are known, the third can be calculated.
255 Our central thesis is that the key to understanding the tuna reproductive
256 strategy lies in convex fitness contours (Fig. 2d). This is consistent with Olsson et al.
257 [3]’s interpretation [3] based on metabolic scaling that relatively higher growth
258 rates early in ontogeny are later replaced by relatively higher death rates due to
259 increased density-dependent mortality as juveniles grow to larger body sizes (see
260 also [21]. Both Olseson et al.’s explanation and our simpler, more general theory
261 invoke assumptions that give rise to bowed-outwards mass-survivorship curves and,
262 in our case, to the convex fitness contours that predict two alternative
263 evolutionarily stable extreme strategies. Our theory predicts that for teleosts the
264 ratio of growth to death rates varies systematically as offspring size increases, so g >
265 d when newborn offspring are very small but g < d later in ontogeny as juveniles
266 approach mature size.
7
267 The theory allows us to offer the following preliminary interpretation of
268 theoretical questions and empirical patterns in the life histories and evolution of
269 teleosts and chondrichthyes:
270 1) Sizes of newborn chondrichthyes.— Why don’t sharks produce smaller offspring?
271 Not only are the offspring of sharks and rays about six orders of magnitude heavier
272 than those of hatchling teleosts (Fig 1), but there is a strong positive correlation
273 between the logarithms of body size of newborn and adult chondrichthyes (r96 =
274 0.82, p<<0.001, Fig 1; [7]Andersen et al. 2016). This begs the question of why the
275 largest sharks and rays don’t produce larger numbers of smaller offspring than they
276 do – more like tunas. The theory suggests the answer: the protection afforded by
277 large eggs and internal development of sharks are adaptations to reduce mortality
278 of juveniles. High death rates impose strong selection, so it is advantageous for
279 adult chondrichthyes to produce the largest possible offspring consistent with the
280 size-number allocation tradeoff. The explanation of the quantitative form of the
281 relationship between offspring size and adult size in chondrichthyes is an open
282 question of great general interest, but beyond the scope of the present paper.
283 2) Sizes of teleost eggs.— Why don’t teleosts produce larger offspring? Figure 1
284 shows that the eggs of marine teleosts are uniformly very small: on average about
285 one milligram (0.001 g), so about 4 orders of magnitude lighter than the smallest
286 newborn sharks and rays ([5-7]Winemiller and Rose 1993; Merrett 1994; Anderson
287 et al. 2016). However, two lineages of freshwater teleosts, the families Poeciliidae
288 and Zenarchopteridae, have independently evolved life histories with internal
289 fertilization, retention of developing eggs within the mother, and live birth – a suite
290 of traits similar to the chondrichthyes. Given the approximately equal diversity of
291 marine and freshwater teleosts (15,000 vs 13,000 species), it seems that there must
292 be some inherent advantage of producing large numbers of very small, externally-
293 fertilized eggs in the marine environment or some powerful constraint against
294 producing large offspring. The question of how small eggs can be is also of interest.
295 We presume that minimum egg size somehow reflects the volume of the zygote
296 required to contain the genetic material, fuel for embryonic development, and Formatted: Font color: Auto
297 related machinery and compounds. The marine teleost zygotes must contain the
298 materials for excreting salts and curtailing water loss in the oceans.needs to fuel
299 embryonic development while excreting salts and curtailing water loss in the oceans
300 3) Exceptional examples.—Additional insights come from the relatively few marine
301 teleosts that lay relatively large eggs and/or provide some degree of parental care.
302 No marine teleost lineages have gone farther than having males protect and
303 sometimes supply nutrition to eggs. The phylogenetically related seahorses and
304 pipefish are examples. Their females produce large numbers of very small eggs,
305 which are fertilized externally before being taken up by the male and brooded and
306 nourished for some substantial period of development [22].
307 4) Historical constraints.—The evolutionary histories of fishes, and more generally of
308 the early vertebrates, suggest important roles for physiological constraints in their
309 phylogenetic, geographic, and environmental histories. Reconstructions of the fossil
310 and phylogenetic histories of major lineages suggest that the physiology of
311 osmoregulation, especially in early ontogeny, played a key role in preventing or
8
312 allowing colonization of freshwater and marine (and ultimately terrestrial)
313 environments.
314 It appears that all extant lineages of vertebrates probably evolved from ancestors
315 that at one time lived in freshwater environments, as evidenced by internal osmotic
316 concentrations more dilute than sea water. The ancestors of chondrichthyes and
317 coelocanths colonized from fresh water and diversified in the oceans in the late
318 Ordivician to mid-Devonian (approximately 400 to 395 mya, respectively; [23, 24].
319 The approximately 1,000 extant species of chimeras, sharks, and rays share with the
320 “living fossil” coelacanth life histories based on internal fertilization and production
321 of a few large well-developed offspring, born or hatched with organs capable of
322 maintaining osmotic balance [25-29].
323 By contrast, the teleosts invaded the oceans from fresh waters much more
324 recently, probably in the Jurassic (~200 mya: [30, 31]). They diversified explosively
325 after the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction event (65 mya) had eliminated several
326 of lineages of chondrichthyes and invertebrates. With approximately 18,000 extant
327 species, teleosts are by far the most diverse group of marine vertebrates. Although
328 some of their success is probably due to jaw structure and other morphological
329 innovations, much of it must be attributed to their diverse body sizes, which span
330 more than 8 orders of magnitude (0.005-2,000,000 g) and allow them to exploit an
331 enormous variety of niches. The diversification of marine teleosts was facilitated by
332 their ability to produce tiny eggs that are externally fertilized, maintain osmotic
333 balance as the embryos develop in sea water, and hatch to give rise to fully
334 functional offspring able to feed themselves and survive independently of their
335 parents [32-35]. There is abundant room to explore further the detailed
336 relationships between fossil and phylogenetic history, osmoregulatory physiology,
337 and life history which are only hinted at here.
338 We conclude that the life histories of marine chondrichthyes and teleosts
339 represent adaptive responses to the fundamental constraint of the number-size
340 allocation tradeoff. The two extreme strategies are maintained because the
341 alternative few-large and many-small strategies represent two peaks of high fitness
342 separated by a valley of low fitness representing moderate numbers of offspring of
343 intermediate sizes. Retaining a few large eggs or embryos within the mother allows
344 sharks to recruit new adults because the slow-growing offspring are protected from
345 high rates of mortality. Producing millions of miniscule eggs allows tunas to recruit
346 new adults because some of the newly-hatched larvae grow fast enough to survive
347 to adulthood, despite high mortality due to competition and predation in the
348 plankton.

469 Fig. 1. Body mass of newborn chondrichthyes (green squares) and teleosts (red
470 circles) as a function of adult body mass. Data from FishBase [36] using conversions
471 mass (g) = 0.01 length(cm)3 except egg mass (g) = 0.52 diameter(cm)3. OLS
472 regression for chondrichthyes (+/-SE): log10 offspring wt = -0.94+/-0.26 + 0.76+/-0.06
473 log10 adult wt (t96 = 13.8, p<<0.001).

475 Fig. 2. Reproductive options and fitness contours represented in loge-loge plots of
476 initial offspring number y0 vs. initial offspring mass x0. a) The reproductive options,
477 represented by the red constraint line, lie on a straight line of slope – 1. The
478 smallest-size strategy, S, is to produce the maximum possible number of tiny
479 offspring; the largest-size strategy, L, is to produce a single offspring of the largest
480 possible size. b) If growth rate exceeds death rate the optimal strategy is indicated
481 by the black star labelled S. Reproductive options with fitness contours are
482 represented by black lines, and the green arrow indicates direction of selection
483 increasing fitness subject to the physiological constraint. Fitness contours are
484 drawn using eqn (2) for a case in which growth rate exceeds death rate by a factor
485 of five, so that d/g = 1/5. c) If growth rate exceeds death rate the optimal strategy is
486 indicated by the black star labelled L.

488 Fig. 3. Fitness contours plotted as in Fig. 2 together with the ratios of death to
489 growth rates that generate them. Left-hand panels show the ratio of death to
490 growth rate plotted in relation to offspring mass, dashed horizontal lines show
491 where death rate = growth rate. Right-hand panels show the resulting fitness
492 contours. In the top row d/g = - ½ log(offspring mass) and this results in fitness
493 contours concave, selecting for an intermediate optimum. In the bottom row d/g = 2
494 + ½ log(offspring mass) and the resulting fitness contours are convex. This selects
495 for extreme strategies. See text for further details.

497 Fig. 4. Examples of theoretically possible mass-abundance curves. Initially there are
498 e4 juveniles (we use natural logarithms) of mass e-4, but as these grow not all
499 survive, and finally for populations in steady state, at most one juvenile remains, of
500 the largest possible size (log mass = 0). Horizontal displacements (blue arrows)
501 indicate growth rates, vertical displacements death rates. Using logarithmic axes
502 scales the lengths of the arrows so as to indicate relative growth rates and per
503 capita death rates, respectively. In convex Type 1 curves the growth rates are
504 initially greater but finally less than the death rates, in concave Type 3 curves the
505 reverse. In log-linear or Type 2 curves the ratio of death rate to growth rate remains
506 constant over ontogeny.

508 Fig. 5. How juvenile survivorship and growth curves as a function of age together
509 determine the shape of mass abundance curves. Points are plotted each time unit.
510 a) Juvenile survivorship curves of the three types identified by [20], plotting the
511 logarithm of the proportion of surviving individuals against age. Type 3 is here
14
512 subdivided into types 3a and 3b. b) A Bertalanffy growth curve plotting the
513 logarithm of juvenile body mass against age. c) Survivorship and growth curves
514 together determine the shape of mass abundance curves, and these are identical in
515 shape to fitness contours. Colour coding as in (a). The critical log-linear survivorship
516 curve (Type 3a) is the one giving rise to a linear mass-abundance curve.

518 Fig. 6. Survivorship and growth curves for mackerel in the NW Atlantic. Survivorship
519 (black solid circles and continuous line) from [37]. Growth curve (blue dotted line)
520 from [38], adjusted to steady state so that mass at 1 year equals initial
521 mass/(survivorship at 1 y). The inverted growth curve gives the critical Type 3a
522 survivorship curve and this is shown by the broken red line.
