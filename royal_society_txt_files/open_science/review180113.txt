This article addresses an important issue with the limitation of the HI assay: determining
antigenic and non-antigenic contributions to titers. There are some grammar issues that need to
be addressed and some other minor points.

The authors use Bayesian inference to estimate underlying antigenic and non-antigenic
parameters for several thousand HI titres. They go on to draw some conclusions about the
3
results, especially the non-antigenic effect size variation related to red blood cell type and the
variability of avidity over time.
The basic idea of having different antigenic effects as well as effects per test virus and reference
virus has been done before for influenza assays, by Ndifon in [9] in a classical context, and in
more complex predictive models by (Bedford et al. 2014, doi:10.7554/eLife.01914) and with
similar (antigenic, test virus and antiserum) terms (Davies et al. 2017, doi:10.1007/s00180-017-
0730-6) in a Bayesian context. As a result the underlying concepts are solid.
However, I have concerns about the data. It's not clear how many repeats of each titre there are.
Certainly in standard HI testing there are ordinarily multiple repeats of each homologous pair
and of reference strain-reference strain comparisons over time, but not of normal test strain pairs.
Supplementary Table 4 does not obviously show any repeats, but if there are none, then we
would expect the errors in the fit to be essentially zero with perfect correlation, as there is a
separate Kxy term for every pair. Is this why there's such a good fit? Is the number of individual
data points 3969, or is that just the number of pairs? This needs to be clarified. It's also not
unusual to find date-of-test effects in this kind of data - was this explored?
My primary concern is about the terminology and strength of the conclusions in the manuscript,
however.
The HI assay has changed over time, especially with the addition of neuraminidase to the assay
to block interference by NA, and this could have significant effects for both the Ay and Jx terms
as individual test viruses are only used once, and even reference viruses are only used for a
handful of years, and so will tend to be mostly pre- or post- the addition of neuraminidase to the
assay. This could affect the Jx values in some years and raises questions about the description of
the Ay terms as measuring the concentration of antibodies. While antibody concentration may be
a component, it is unlikely to be the whole story, and without further direct evidence it does not
seem to be appropriate to describe it in those terms.
The changes attributed to the source of red blood cells in Fig. 1 is also interesting, but in terms of
the Jx values, how are the blood cell sources distributed over time - could blood source just be a
correlate? Again on Jx, it has been established from direct measurement that avidity has dropped
over time for H3N2 (e.g. Lin et al. 2012, doi:10.1073/pnas.1218841110) - this does not happen in
Fig. 2 for the Jx terms, which suggests that describing it in those terms is not helpful.
Minor point
I assume as a Royal Society journal, this journal uses british english? If so, significant spelling
corrections need to be made - especially titer->titre, hemagglutinin-> haemagglutinin.

The authors' responses clarify that there are significantly more parameters in this model than
there are data points. As a result of this over-parameterisation, it is certain that any similar
dataset could achieve the essentially 0 error described in section 2.2, lines 32-45. This is an
inevitable result of the model, and not in any reasonable sense an evaluation of the model beyond
the fact that it has been implemented correctly. This should be made clear.
Also in the next paragraph, starting on line 49, you then describe the fact that the Ay values (I
presume, they are not directly named?) have values consistent with reported empirical values,
which sounds like evidence that your model is indeed returning Ab concentrations. However,
you earlier describe Ay as having mean µA, which in turn is a hyperparameter with mean µ'A
and variance 1/tau'A, "both of which are known". To me, this means that you chose the mean
and variance to fit the empirical values, so your ability to recover these empirical values is not
surprising, and not evidence of anything either. If that's correct, then this should be
acknowledged.
Related to this, the authors continue to describe Ay as "the concentration of antibodies obtained
using strain Y" and Kxy as "the average affinity of those antibodies for antigens of strain X" in
section 2.1, lines 5-10, and again later in the results and the discussion. I still believe these
statements are too strong, and are not evidenced, even though it seems that hyperparameter
priors have been set to make the results consistent with those real-world features (affinities,
antibody concentrations, avidity, etc.). I don't doubt that we wish this to be true, but I think a
more cautious approach of describing them as related to these properties is necessary. Generally,
throughout this text, I think more caution needs to be included in assertions about relationships
between terms in the model and features in the real world.

Dear Dr. Adabor,
Thank-you for re-submitting your manuscript and addressing the comments of the reviewers.
We sent your revised manuscript back out for feedback from these reviewers and the second
reviewer believes you still over-claim the importance of your results by describing them in terms
of antibody concentrations, affinities and avidity. This reviewer believes the language should be
much more cautious throughout. For more details, see their review appended here.
I therefore invite you to make further modifications to your manuscript along the lines of those
suggested by the reviewer, or to give a convincing rebuttal to their comments. In any case, please
submit a revised manuscript and a point-by-point response to the reviewer comments. I look
forward to seeing these.
With best wishes, Len Thomas AE

ponse: The sentence has been rewritten for clarity (please see page 3, paragraph #1 of the
nuscript).
age 7. Line 8. Header name should be changed to "Model evaluation for estimating HI titers"
ponse: The header name has been changed to "Model evaluation for estimating HI titres". It is
heading of section 2.2.
Page 8. Line 30. Header name should be changed to "Model evaluation for distinguishing the
rces of red blood cells in HI assays"
ponse: The header name has been changed to "Model evaluation for distinguishing the sources

ponse: We have changed the x-axis and y-axis labels to make them more legible.
iewer #2.
However, I have concerns about the data. It's not clear how many repeats of each titre there are.
tainly in standard HI testing there are ordinarily multiple repeats of each homologous pair and of
rence strain-reference strain comparisons over time, but not of normal test strain pairs.
plementary Table 4 does not obviously show any repeats, but if there are none, then we would
ect the errors in the fit to be essentially zero with perfect correlation, as there is a separate Kxy
m for every pair. Is this why there's such a good fit? Is the number of individual data points 3969,
s that just the number of pairs? This needs to be clarified. It's also not unusual to find date-of-test
cts in this kind of data - was this explored?
ponse: The Supplementary Table S4 is a collection of HI titres reported from previously
lished studies [refs 20-26]. In our study, we only make use of these reported data in applying the
hods. The number of data points corresponding to each of 3969 strain-serum pairs is 3969. This
now been clarified in the manuscript (please see the first sentence of section 2.2). Our focus
to investigate the use of Bayesian modelling to decouple the antigenic and non-antigenic
iables determining HI titers, and we did not assess whether there are any date-of-test effects.
The HI assay has changed over time, especially with the addition of neuraminidase to the assay
lock interference by NA, and this could have significant effects for both the Ay and Jx terms as
ividual test viruses are only used once, and even reference viruses are only used for a handful of
rs, and so will tend to be mostly pre- or post- the addition of neuraminidase to the assay. This
ld affect the Jx values in some years and raises questions about the description of the Ay terms
measuring the concentration of antibodies. While antibody concentration may be a component, it
unlikely to be the whole story, and without further direct evidence it does not seem to be
ropriate to describe it in those terms.
ponse: The equilibrium association constant for virus-red cell bonds depends on both an
ociation and a dissociation rate, and the latter depends on the activity of neuraminidase [ref 9].
ong all the parameters of the HI equation, only Jx depends on the equilibrium association
stant for virus-red cell bonds. Hence, the addition of neuraminidase will primarily affect the Jx
ues. We have now mentioned this in the manuscript (please see page 4, paragraph #1).
The changes attributed to the source of red blood cells in Fig. 1 is also interesting, but in terms
he Jx values, how are the blood cell sources distributed over time - could blood source just be a
relate? Again on Jx, it has been established from direct measurement that avidity has dropped
r time for H3N2 (e.g. Lin et al. 2012, doi:10.1073/pnas.1218841110) - this does not happen in
. 2 for the Jx terms, which suggests that describing it in those terms is not helpful.
ponse: In the current set of data, chicken blood cells were used from 1968 to 1992, turkey blood
s were used from 1993 to 2005 and guinea pig blood cells were used from 2006 to 2016. The
ues of non-antigenic variable (Jx) with respect to the sources of red cells are further presented in
ure S4 of the Supplementary Material. Notably, we do find that Jx values are higher for red cell
rces used more recently compared to earlier ones (i.e. guinea pig and turkey vs. chicken) (please
Figure 1). Consistent with these results, we find that Jx values are positively correlated with the
r of virus isolation (r=0.15, p=0.003). Because Jx is inversely correlated with virus avidity for
cells [ref. 9], it follows that virus avidity has decreased over time in line with the report cited by
reviewer. We have now mentioned this in the text (page 10, paragraph #1).
I assume as a Royal Society journal, this journal uses british english? If so, significant spelling
rections need to be made - especially titer->titre, hemagglutinin-> haemagglutinin.
ponse: The needed spelling corrections have been effected and highlighted in the revised
nuscript

RESPONSES TO REVIEWER COMMENTS
iewer: 2
1. The authors' responses clarify that there are significantly more parameters in this model than
there are data points. As a result of this over-parameterisation, it is certain that any similar
dataset could achieve the essentially 0 error described in section 2.2, lines 32-45. This is an
inevitable result of the model, and not in any reasonable sense an evaluation of the model
beyond the fact that it has been implemented correctly. This should be made clear.
hors’ response: We have now added a new paragraph to the Discussion section outlining several
itations of our analysis, including the fact that the excellent fit of our model was expected
ause there were more model parameters than data points (page 13, paragraph #2). In addition,
have deleted the statements “it provides an excellent fit to the titres” (abstract) and “We showed
t the model has an excellent fit to HI titers, providing confidence in its further application”
ge 12, paragraph #2). Furthermore, we have changed “confirm adequacy and applicability of
Bayesian inference procedure” to “confirm their realism” (page 15, paragraph #3).
2. Also in the next paragraph, starting on line 49, you then describe the fact that the Ay values
(I presume, they are not directly named?) have values consistent with reported empirical
values, which sounds like evidence that your model is indeed returning Ab concentrations.
However, you earlier describe Ay as having mean µA, which in turn is a hyperparameter
with mean µ'A and variance 1/tau'A, "both of which are known". To me, this means that you
chose the mean and variance to fit the empirical values, so your ability to recover these
empirical values is not surprising, and not evidence of anything either. If that's correct, then
this should be acknowledged.
hors’ response: We have now added a new paragraph to the Discussion section outlining several
itations of our analysis, including the fact that the realism of the inferred parameter values was
ected because we used hyperpriors to constrain those values (page 13, paragraph 2).
3. Related to this, the authors continue to describe Ay as "the concentration of antibodies
obtained using strain Y" and Kxy as "the average affinity of those antibodies for antigens of
strain X" in section 2.1, lines 5-10, and again later in the results and the discussion. I still
believe these statements are too strong, and are not evidenced, even though it seems that
hyperparameter priors have been set to make the results consistent with those real-world
features (affinities, antibody concentrations, avidity, etc.). I don't doubt that we wish this to
be true, but I think a more cautious approach of describing them as related to these
properties is necessary. Generally, throughout this text, I think more caution needs to be
included in assertions about relationships between terms in the model and features in the real
world.
hors’ response: The correspondence between the parameters and reality derives from our
viously published biophysical model of the HI assay (ref. 9), and not from the Bayesian analysis
orted in the present manuscript. That said, as suggested by the reviewer, we have toned down the
in several ways, including:
<U+F06E> deleting “it provides an excellent fit to the titres” from the abstract,
<U+F06E> deleting “We showed that the model has an excellent fit to HI titers, providing confidence in
its further application” (page 12, paragraph # 2), and
<U+F06E> changing “confirm adequacy and applicability of the Bayesian inference procedure” to
“confirm their realism” (page 15, paragraph #3).
