This is an impressive paper on a difficult but important topic. The experiment was admirably
well-thought out and, one must infer, heroically organized.
Of course interpreting the scanning results is filled with uncertainty until we know much more
about the network level.The regions of interest (dlPFC, insult, amygdala, anterior consulate etc.)
are tagged in many experiments, and we do not really understand exactly what these regions do.
Nevertheless the scanning interpretations provided in this paper seem reasonably qualified given
the uncertainties. I was puzzled by one thing: the scared values experiment performed by Berns
et al 2012 (referred to in the bib) found an increase in dlPFC activity to scared value matters,
whereas this paper found a decrease. Perhaps the differences in the experiments (e.g. country of
origin of the sample) account for this differences.
The authors are right to mention that it would be very useful to know the differences in scan
results that include controls, such as those who are radicalized but do not have strong sacred
values, and those who are not radicalized and do not have sacred values. This would be
interesting especially because basic personality differences in such matters as being outgoing or
being anxious appear to play a significant role in strong political attitudes. But the authors were
wise not to try to undertake that experiment this time. So this is not a criticism, just an
acknowledgement of their reasonable caution.

I’ve read with interest the paper submitted by Hamid and colleagues. This study reports a
functional neuroimaging study designed to examine brain processes associated with “costly”
decisions involving “sacred values” and whether those sacred values are implemented in similar
or distinct circuits.
The very idea that sacred value may be processed differently than non-sacred values is intriguing
because a large body of work in cognitive neuroscience and neuroeconomics does not support the
idea that social and non-social decision making involve distinct computations, including the
vmPFC. I don’t think that fMRI has the spatial resolution to tell us this. Even using MVPA
doesn’t change the fact that one voxel includes hundreds of thousands of neurons. It is possible
that Royal Society Open Science journal has a strict word limit (I am not familiar with this outlet).
If this isn’t the case, I would suggest the authors unpack the paragraph on pg. 5, lines 88-94. The
way it is written (too concisely), sounds like a bit neo-phrenology and heavily relying on reverse
inference. Similarly, the mention of social influence and brain mechanisms (pg. 6, lines 37-39) is a
bit simplistic. Again, that may be due to word-constraint from the journal requirement.
The study design and statistical analysis are sound. The authors took a very conservative
approach to try and rule out alternative explanations for the fMRI data (i.e. neurosynth masks,
follow-up subjective ratings). I am not a fan of dual process models, but their results are at least
consistent with a model where decision-making about non-sacred values (compared to decision-
making about sacred values) relies more on cognitive control.
It’s a bit surprising that no clusters were more active for sacred value decision-making, and the
authors could speculate on why that might be the case. For instance, if they really want to make a
dual process argument a la Greene, then the sacred value decisions should elicit response in
“affective” regions, e.g. amygdala.
The social conformity effect on willingness to fight and die is interesting, and the authors did a
good job highlighting that decisions about sacred values are distinct from the values themselves.
Finally, the authors very briefly mention MVPA (line 292), and then only talk about it again in the
results (page 19). It seems like they are only using that to show *some* effect of self-reported
moral outrage, but it seems unnecessary.

This manuscript describes an fMRI study of sacred values in a population of radicalized Islamic
adults in Spain. The study aims to investigate the neural mechanisms involved in making
decisions about “sacred” versus non-sacred values and also attitude change via peer influence.
The involvement of this special population makes this paper’s contribution potentially very
important, the experiment is well-conducted, the paper is well-written, and the results are
interesting. Nevertheless, the study faces some difficult interpretational issues that could be
handled with more care in the manuscript.
The main findings are that making decisions about non-sacred values activated DLPFC, IFC, and
parietal areas more than making decisions about non-sacred values. Interestingly, participants
ratings of willingness to fight and die were susceptible to peer influence, for both sacred and non-
sacred values. Change in these ratings was associated with activity in DLPFC.
The main difficulty, as I see it, is in interpreting just what exactly these brain activations are
reflecting. This is really a general challenge with mapping something a very high-level
psychological concept like sacred values onto neural systems. Sacred and non-sacred values
differ in several ways. The authors address this by including analyses where several factors such
as emotion, familiarity, and salience are regressed out, subtracting away many of the brain
regions from the sacred/non-sacred contrast. I think the inclusion of these analyses strengthens
the paper and is very important. However, it seems to me that there is a deep issue here as to
which of these components is essential to “sacred” cognition and which are ancillary, and it’s not
clear to me what the authors are trying to say with these analyses. Surely the emotional
component of sacredness is integral, for example. By regressing it out are the authors trying to
say that what is left over is the essence of sacredness, or do they believe that all of these
components interact together to produce sacred cognition? After all sacredness is correlated with
all of these variables so it’s not clear that such a target could be triangulated in this way. It would
seem artificial, for example, to mask out regions involved in feeling and reward anticipation if
those are integral to the process of cost-benefit analysis.
The one trivial explanation of these results that would probably be the least interesting is that the
differences all boil down to cognitive effort. Response times are faster to sacred values compared
with non-sacred values, and when we look at these brain maps we may just be seeing maps of
decision-making effort that would look similar regardless of the content of the decision. Even
though efforts were made to choose non-sacred topics with which the participants were highly
familiar, the answers to questions regarding sacred value decisions may be so rote that they do
not require any attentional resources to arrive at, they are “cached” off-line so to speak. Is it
surprising that there are no brain regions that are more active for sacred decisions than for non-
sacred decisions if the difference between the two is a difference in kind of cognitive process
instead of just the difference in degree of cognitive processing? I think a deeper discussion of this
possibility would strengthen the paper.
There is also not much discussion of how these results relate to other results found in the
(admittedly small) neuroimaging of sacred values literature. Discussion of the specifics of this
5
study’s results in light of previous literature seems somewhat cursory and could be expanded to
improve the paper. For example, is the activity related to attitude change in the DLPFC consistent
with the neuroimaging literature on belief and attitude change?
Etc:
Line 292 refers to MVPA methods in the supporting information, but I do not see any reference to
MVPA methods in the supporting materials document.

This is an impressive paper on a difficult but important topic. The experiment was
admirably well-thought out and, one must infer, heroically organized.
Of course interpreting the scanning results is filled with uncertainty until we know
much more about the network level. The regions of interest (dlPFC, insult, amygdala,
anterior consulate etc.) are tagged in many experiments, and we do not really
understand exactly what these regions do. Nevertheless the scanning interpretations
provided in this paper seem reasonably qualified given the uncertainties.
1. I was puzzled by one thing: the scared values experiment performed by
Berns et al 2012 (referred to in the bib) found an increase in dlPFC activity
to scared value matters, whereas this paper found a decrease. Perhaps the
differences in the experiments (e.g. country of origin of the sample) account
for this differences.
We thank the reviewer for his/her comments. To clarify: Berns et al 2012 identified
the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) in response to sacred values, and we
found decreased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity. These two regions
are associated with different functions. On one hand, as mentioned in Berns et al
2012, the vlPFC has been typically associated with rule retrieval. On the other hand,
the dlPFC is associated with cognitive control and deliberation. The decrease in
dlPFC that we identified does not overlap with Bern’s vlPFC, it’s a functionally
distinct area.
Perhaps another question is why didn’t we find vlPFC as did Berns et al 2012? A
reasonable explanation is that we employed a different experimental paradigm. That is,
Berns et al 2012 found vlPFC in response to passive viewing of sacred values, while in
our paradigm participants had to convey their willingness to fight and die for sacred
values, which activates decision-making mechanisms in the brain. If we had used a
passive viewing paradigm comparing sacred and non-sacred value processing, we may
have been able to detect vlPFC activity associated with sacred values.
We have added this interpretation to the discussion section with the following sentences
(pp. 23, lines 559-563):
“Previous neuroimaging studies have shown vlPFC activation during sacred value
processing (31,33). Yet, we found decreased DLPFC activation. This may owe to the
difference in our paradigms. Whereas previous studies examined passive viewing of
(non-)sacred values, our paradigm asked participants to evaluate their willingness to
fight and die for these values.”
2. The authors are right to mention that it would be very useful to know the
differences in scan results that include controls, such as those who are
radicalized but do not have strong sacred values, and those who are not
radicalized and do not have sacred values. This would be interesting
especially because basic personality differences in such matters as being
outgoing or being anxious appear to play a significant role in strong political
attitudes. But the authors were wise not to try to undertake that experiment
this time. So this is not a criticism, just an acknowledgement of their
reasonable caution.
We agree with the reviewer about including a control group in future studies, although
the issue of what could count as selection criteria for controls merits its own theoretical
discussion.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
I’ve read with interest the paper submitted by Hamid and colleagues. This study reports
a functional neuroimaging study designed to examine brain processes associated with
“costly” decisions involving “sacred values” and whether those sacred values are
implemented in similar or distinct circuits.
1. The very idea that sacred value may be processed differently than non-sacred
values is intriguing because a large body of work in cognitive neuroscience and
neuroeconomics does not support the idea that social and non-social decision
making involve distinct computations, including the vmPFC. I don’t think that
fMRI has the spatial resolution to tell us this. Even using MVPA doesn’t change
the fact that one voxel includes hundreds of thousands of neurons.
We thank the reviewer for his/her comment. We agree with the reviewer that fMRI
alone cannot prove that SVs are processed differently than nSVS. Nevertheless,
fMRI has been useful in many domains, and with several different experimental
paradigms, to support theoretical hypotheses about how humans process, for
example, beliefs. Even if the spatial resolution of fMRI is, in fact, at multivoxel
level, it is also true that different regions of the brain, such as the vmPFC or the
DLPFC, have been systematically associated with different functions.
2. It is possible that Royal Society Open Science journal has a strict word limit (I
am not familiar with this outlet). If this isn’t the case, I would suggest the
authors unpack the paragraph on pg. 5, lines 88-94. The way it is written (too
concisely), sounds like a bit neo-phrenology and heavily relying on reverse
inference.
Following the reviewer’s advice, we have edited this paragraph as follows (pg. 5, lines
89-100):
“Previous work has identified brain regions implicated in utilitarian cost-benefit
calculations during value-based decision-making. Specifically, trading off costs and
benefits -- both in simple decisions involving outcomes for oneself as well as more
complex moral decisions -- has been associated with neural activity in subcortical
regions, such as striatum and amygdala, as well as cortical regions including lateral
prefrontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex (20,21).
The vmPFC, in particular, has been hypothesized to function as a global value
comparator during value-based choices, and its activity has been found to correlate with
value differences between chosen and unchosen items in a variety of contexts, from
monetary settings up to food preferences (20, 22). In addition, prior studies suggest that
the dlPFC modulates vmPFC activity during decisions that require cognitive control,
such as sticking to healthy food choices (23), or reweighting of stimulus in front of new
contextual information in monetary settings (24).”
3. Similarly, the mention of social influence and brain mechanisms (pg. 6, lines 37-
39) is a bit simplistic. Again, that may be due to word-constraint from the
journal requirement.
We agree that our mention of social influence and brain mechanisms was cursory.
Accordingly, we’ve extended our section on this topic as follows (pp. 6-7, lines 136-
156):
“In our second fMRI experiment we investigated one such strategy: influencing
via peer feedback. Ever since Solomon Asch’s (25) pioneering work on social
conformity, extensive research in social cognition has shown that human behaviour is
not only guided by subjective attitudes and values but also by perceptions of others’
attitudes and values (26). Some studies have shown that inducing false perceptions of
others’ moral judgments can influence people to change their own moral judgments
(27,28). Research on sacred values, however, has shown that such values are resistant to
social influence (8). Neuroimaging research suggests that when social consensus
conflicts with subjects’ judgments, the degree of activation in prediction error networks
and orbitofrontal cortex predicts the degree of change in judgments at a later time
(29,30). The only neuroimaging study published on social conformity and sacred values
to-date revealed that increased VLPFC activity for sacred values predicted weaker
social conformity, whereas decreased VLPFC activity predicted greater conformist
behavior (31).
Research on radicalization distinguishes between deradicalization and
disengagement, suggesting that former violent extremists rarely change their beliefs
(deradicalize) but more often lose their motivation to defend them (disengage) (32).
Accordingly, we conjectured that it might be possible to induce flexibility in the way
people defend their sacred values. Thus, we tested whether willingness to fight and die
for sacred values is amenable to social influence and, if so, whether regions previously
associated with attitude change (29,30) correlate with change in judgment for sacred
versus non-sacred values.”
4. The study design and statistical analysis are sound. The authors took a very
conservative approach to try and rule out alternative explanations for the fMRI
data (i.e. neurosynth masks, follow-up subjective ratings). I am not a fan of dual
process models, but their results are at least consistent with a model where
decision-making about non-sacred values (compared to decision-making about
sacred values) relies more on cognitive control.
We appreciate the reviewer’s caution about dual-process models, and this why – as the
reviewer indicates – we took a conservative approach to add rigor to our design and
ensure the plausibility of our model if, as indeed it turned out, the model was supported
by robust statistical results.
5. It’s a bit surprising that no clusters were more active for sacred value decision-
making, and the authors could speculate on why that might be the case. For
instance, if they really want to make a dual process argument a la Greene, then
the sacred value decisions should elicit response in “affective” regions, e.g.
amygdala.
We agree with the reviewer that the lack of areas with increased activation for sacred
values is intriguing. In response to the reviewer’s observation we have added the
following paragraph to our discussion to explore possible reasons for why our data did
not show positive activity for sacred values (pg. 22, lines 533-537):
“The question remains of why there were no brain regions associated with
affective processing, such as the amygdala, which activated during the sacred compared
to the non-sacred value condition. We believe that the most likely explanation for this
owes to our experimental paradigm not being sensitive enough to detect the differential
neural activity associated with affective regions.”
6. The social conformity effect on willingness to fight and die is interesting, and
the authors did a good job highlighting that decisions about sacred values are
distinct from the values themselves.
We thank the reviewer for his/her comment.
7. Finally, the authors very briefly mention MVPA (line 292), and then only talk
about it again in the results (page 19). It seems like they are only using that to
show *some* effect of self-reported moral outrage, but it seems unnecessary.
We agree that the MVPA analysis could be seen as redundant and therefore have
eliminated all mention of it from the manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript describes an fMRI study of sacred values in a population of radicalized
Islamic adults in Spain. The study aims to investigate the neural mechanisms involved
in making decisions about “sacred” versus non-sacred values and also attitude change
via peer influence. The involvement of this special population makes this paper’s
contribution potentially very important, the experiment is well-conducted, the paper is
well-written, and the results are interesting. Nevertheless, the study faces some difficult
interpretational issues that could be handled with more care in the manuscript.
The main findings are that making decisions about non-sacred values activated DLPFC,
IFC, and parietal areas more than making decisions about non-sacred values.
Interestingly, participants ratings of willingness to fight and die were susceptible to peer
influence, for both sacred and non-sacred values. Change in these ratings was associated
with activity in DLPFC.
1. The main difficulty, as I see it, is in interpreting just what exactly these brain
activations are reflecting. This is really a general challenge with mapping
something a very high-level psychological concept like sacred values onto
neural systems. Sacred and non-sacred values differ in several ways. The authors
address this by including analyses where several factors such as emotion,
familiarity, and salience are regressed out, subtracting away many of the brain
regions from the sacred/non-sacred contrast. I think the inclusion of these
analyses strengthens the paper and is very important. However, it seems to me
that there is a deep issue here as to which of these components is essential to
“sacred” cognition and which are ancillary, and it’s not clear to me what the
authors are trying to say with these analyses. Surely the emotional component of
sacredness is integral, for example. By regressing it out are the authors trying to
say that what is left over is the essence of sacredness, or do they believe that all
of these components interact together to produce sacred cognition? After all
sacredness is correlated with all of these variables so it’s not clear that such a
target could be triangulated in this way. It would seem artificial, for example, to
mask out regions involved in feeling and reward anticipation if those are integral
to the process of cost-benefit analysis.
We agree with the reviewer that emotion, as well as other factors correlated with sacred
values, may be an integral part of sacred values. However, we sought to ensure that
sacredness could not be attributed to any one of these factors alone. Given our
paradigm, the best way to verify this would be to regress out these factors. By
regressing out emotional intensity, familiarity, and salience, we provide evidence that
sacred value processing relies on brain areas that do not overlap with brain regions
associated with each one of these factors. This does not imply that the brain areas
associated with emotion and the other controlled factors are not typically active during
sacred value processing; rather, it suggests that sacred values rely on more than just
those areas. Sacred values may well have inherent emotional dimensions; however, our
study indicates that sacred values are associated with cognitive factors beyond
emotional processes. We hope that this study contributes to further theorizing about the
components of sacredness.
In response to the reviewer’s concerns, we have added the following sentence to the
discussion (pg. 18, lines 436-438):
“This is not to deny that emotions and other factors may be integral to sacred values (5);
however, our approach sought to ensure that sacredness could not be attributed
exclusively to these other factors.”
2. The one trivial explanation of these results that would probably be the least
interesting is that the differences all boil down to cognitive effort. Response
times are faster to sacred values compared with non-sacred values, and when we
look at these brain maps we may just be seeing maps of decision-making effort
that would look similar regardless of the content of the decision. Even though
efforts were made to choose non-sacred topics with which the participants were
highly familiar, the answers to questions regarding sacred value decisions may
be so rote that they do not require any attentional resources to arrive at, they are
“cached” off-line so to speak. Is it surprising that there are no brain regions that
are more active for sacred decisions than for non-sacred decisions if the
difference between the two is a difference in kind of cognitive process instead of
just the difference in degree of cognitive processing? I think a deeper discussion
of this possibility would strengthen the paper.
The reviewer makes an interesting point about the neural differences between sacred
and non-sacred values perhaps resulting from differences in cognitive effort. We believe
what’s interesting about our results is that we found differences in cognitive effort in
areas associated with deliberation. This indicates that these differences may be
differences in effort of deliberation, not in cognitive effort generally. Accordingly, we
have edited the discussion in the following way (pg. 22-23, lines 538-546):
“The finding that non-sacred compared to sacred value processing relied on
brain areas typically associated with deliberation could result from the elicitation of
different degrees of cognitive effort involved in decisions regarding sacred versus non-
sacred values. As suggested by previous literature, decisions regarding sacred values
may rely on deontic rights and wrongs, whereas decisions over non-sacred values may
rely on cost-benefit ponderation (31,33). This would involve different degrees of
cognitive effort in both situations: sacred values would work as a heuristic making
decisions easy to solve, or cached-offline, whereas decisions regarding non-sacred
values would involve some degree of calculation, such a distinction is consistent with
our results.”
3. There is also not much discussion of how these results relate to other results
found in the (admittedly small) neuroimaging of sacred values literature.
Discussion of the specifics of this study’s results in light of previous literature
seems somewhat cursory and could be expanded to improve the paper. For
example, is the activity related to attitude change in the DLPFC consistent with
the neuroimaging literature on belief and attitude change?
We agree that our discussion was too limited on this topic and have added the following
paragraph to our discussion section (pp. 23-24, lines 559-569):
“Previous neuroimaging studies have shown vlPFC activation during sacred
value processing (31,33). Yet, we found decreased DLPFC activation. This may owe to
the difference in our paradigms. Whereas previous studies examined passive viewing of
(non-)sacred values, our paradigm asked participants to evaluate their willingness to
fight and die for these values. In addition, we found that change in WFD due to false
consensus feedback was correlated with activity in DLPFC. This result is consistent
with studies on the role of DLPFC in attitude change. DLPFC has been shown to play a
role in behavioral adjustment after the experience of conflict (42-44). The role of
DLPFC in conflict resolution is evident in research on adjustment of preferences
motivated by cognitive dissonance reduction (45). This research is consistent with our
findings, which indicate that DLFPC could play a role in social conformity of WFD in
the face of peers-conflicting feedback.”
Etc:
4. Line 292 refers to MVPA methods in the supporting information, but I do not
see any reference to MVPA methods in the supporting materials document.
Owing to redundancy with the univariate analysis results, we have eliminated the
MVPA from the revised manuscript.
