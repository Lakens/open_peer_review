The goal of this manuscript was to test the associations among two different and commonly used
measures of dietary restraint, the Restraint Scale and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire
Restrained Eating (DEBQ-RE) in four different samples. Further, the authors tested the
associations of each of these scales with body mass index, non-homeostatic eating (defined as
external and disinhibited eating), and food craving (to chocolate and general foods), and
compared the strength of the associations with each of the restraint scales with these external
correlates. The authors also tested the factor structure and internal consistency of the Restraint
Scale and DEBQ-RE. First, the authors found that the Restraint Scale and DEBQ-RE were
significantly correlated. Second, dietary restraint was differentially associated with external and
disinhibited eating across samples; however, overall, the Restraint Scale demonstrated larger
associations with these non-homeostatic eating processes compared to the DEBQ-RE. In general,
the RS demonstrated a stronger positive correlation to food craving and body mass index than
3
the DEBQ-RE. Finally, the authors found that the DEBQ-RE and Restraint Scale factor structures
replicated across samples.
Strengths of the study include a large sample size and the study helps the field move toward
better understanding the multi-faceted nature of dietary restraint and differential associations
among external correlates. The authors are also very clearly familiar with the dietary restraint
literature. However, despite these strengths, I have reservations about the manuscript in its
current form. My strongest concerns lie within the Introduction, as I feel that the Introduction
lacks focus and could be significantly streamlined and also lacks scientific hypotheses to frame
the research study. Other, more minor concerns are detailed in the review.
Overall Comments
Please be sure to use person-first language throughout the manuscript when describing weight
status in persons. For example, it would be preferable to use the phrase “individuals with
obesity” (vs. obese individuals).
This is very minor, but please spell out the first use of body mass index before using the
abbreviation of BMI.
Introduction
The authors clearly are well-versed in the dietary restraint literature and the Introduction
contains a lot of wonderful information about dietary restraint. At the same time, the
Introduction feels a bit unfocused and quite long. I think the manuscript would be much
improved if the Introduction were streamlined.
I also would love for the authors to enumerate hypotheses at the end of the Introduction to help
frame the study. Based on the prior research, what did you think you might find?
In the first paragraph, I also disagree with the statement that “Overall, rigid diets are not only
ineffective for weight loss…” Prescribed, medically monitored very-low calorie diets are effective
in promoting weight loss in the short-term. The authors may want to revise this sentence to say
that rigid diets are not effective in the long-term (or something of the like).
Method
I would like to see more evidence of reliability and validity of scale scores presented in the
description of each measure. Moreover, I would like for internal consistency values to be
separated and specified within the description of each measure.
Please report body mass index descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, range) for each
sample in the Method section rather than in the Results section. BMI is a standard demographic
variable for study such as this.
How were missing data handled? I am sure there were some missing data across the four
different samples and large overall sample size.
What were the fit statistics of the reported factor analyses? Did the authors use parallel analysis
to determine the number of factors to extract?
Were study measures completed online or in-person?

Results
Results were somewhat overwhelming in the way that they were presented. The authors might
consider a more concise presentation of their results.
Discussion
Throughout the Discussion, the authors should tone down their conclusions given that this a
cross-sectional study.

Review
Title: Do restrained eaters show increased BMI, food craving, and disinhibited eating?
A comparison of the Restraint Scale and the Restrained Eating scale of the Dutch
Eating Behaviour Questionnaire
Thank you very much for this really interesting paper, comparing to commonly used measures
of dietary restrain, the DEBQ-Restaing subscale and the Restraint scale. I think the paper
would be of great interest to eating behaviour researchers. See below for some comments.
Abstract
Thank you for the concise abstract. Please add the exact number of participants included,
instead of “more than 1700 participants”. In addition, I would suggest adding the key results
as well, such as the correlation coefficient between the scales, and the range of correlations
coefficients between the two scales and the other phenotypes.
Introduction
Overall an interesting introduction covering a lot of the theoretical and research background.
I believe, that at four pages, the introduction is too long, and some of the information especially
in the end is either redundant or could be moved to other sections. The introduction is longer
than the discussion, which seems a bit unusual. See below for more specific comments.
1. Page 3, from line 7: One suggestion would be to remove the section focussing on
restraint and impulsivity. Impulsivity is not included in the later study, and I would
propose to start with the mixed evidence around restraint and BMI.
2. Page 4, from line 3: I would recommend adding a reference for the statement that
recommendations around restraint have been relaxed.
3. Page 4, line 17: Please rephrase “morbidly obese adults” using person-first language
to avoid stigmatising language. One option would be: “adult with morbid obesity”.
4. Page 6: I get the impression that there is too much detail here, and some of the
descriptors of the sample etc, should be moved to the methods section of the paper or
deleted e.g. from line 8 to line 36.
Some information is repeated eg: line 52 “We analyse data from more than 1700
participants making it the largest study of its kind…”.
In addition, the final lines of the introduction seem to summarise the findings of the
current study and I would suggest removing this. In my opinion a clear statement of
the aims such as in line 46: “The aim of this study was to explore potential differences
across restraint measures so that we could help to identify the most appropriate
prescreening tool for eating-related interventions” is sufficient for the introduction and
leave all the details about sample selection etc. for the methods.
Methods
Participants
1. I would suggest removing the information regarding the prescreening as it does not
seem relevant.
2. The participant section could be restructured to something like: There were four
samples included in this study. Sample 1 (N=xxx) consisted of staff and students from
Cardiff university (x% female, age mean, range). Sample 2 (N=xx) included of
undergrad psychology students (x% female, age mean, range). Sample 3 etc…
Overall, the total sample was XXX. Table 1 shows the different measures available in
the different samples”
Measures and materials
Please add an example item for each of the mentioned scales so the readers unfamiliar with
field can get an insight in what a typical question might be like.
Analyses
I would suggest breaking up the analyses section with subheading so it is easier to follow, as
it was done in the results section: Internal consistency, Factor structure, Similarities and
differences between scales, Statistical power
Results
Before giving more details of the results, a summary table of all data included would be useful
including scores on scales, ages, %sex etc for the four samples.
Overall, the results sections sometimes veers into discussing the results, such as “Consistent
with previous findings…” (page 11, line 36). I would suggest removing these and keeping them
for the discussion.
As a reader, I would have preferred to have Table S.5 in the main manuscript instead of Table
2, as it shows all correlations across all measures, which I feel, might be seen as the main
results and should be put to the forefront.
Discussion
I would suggest removing the first sentence and references and starting with “In the largest…”
Page 16, line: 26: I would be worried about over-interpreting the non-significant associations
between DEBQRE and BMI and their direction. Please rephrase.
Page 17, last sentence: Maybe change “The Restraint Scale” in to RS for consistency.
Overall, I am missing critical evaluation of the study. What were the biggest strength and
limitations of this work? For example, it seems that the ratio between men and women was
unbalanced, as seen in Table S.4. The majority of the sample were women, which also rated
higher on all the different scales. What effect would that have on the validity of the scales? Is
one questionnaire maybe more relevant for men versus women? Just a few points to consider.
I hope these comments are helpful!
Thank you

Abstract
Thank you for the concise abstract. Please add the exact number of participants included,
instead of “more than 1700 participants”. In addition, I would suggest adding the key results
as well, such as the correlation coefficient between the scales, and the range of correlations
coefficients between the two scales and the other phenotypes.
The number of participants has been added to the abstract along with the key results as
suggested.
Introduction
Overall an interesting introduction covering a lot of the theoretical and research background.
I believe, that at four pages, the introduction is too long, and some of the information especially
in the end is either redundant or could be moved to other sections. The introduction is longer
than the discussion, which seems a bit unusual. See below for more specific comments.
We have followed your suggestions and the introduction has now been shortened by
removing the paragraph on impulsivity and unnecessary methodological information.
1. Page 3, from line 7: One suggestion would be to remove the section focussing on
restraint and impulsivity. Impulsivity is not included in the later study, and I would
propose to start with the mixed evidence around restraint and BMI.
This section has now been removed
2. Page 4, from line 3: I would recommend adding a reference for the statement that
recommendations around restraint have been relaxed.
A reference has now been added:
‘The association between dietary restraint and overeating has led to recommendations to
relax restraint in order to promote healthy eating (Polivy & Herman, 1992); however, this
has proved controversial due to inconsistencies across findings.’
3. Page 4, line 17: Please rephrase “morbidly obese adults” using person-first language
to avoid stigmatising language. One option would be: “adult with morbid obesity”.
This has now been rephrased as “adults with morbid obesity”
4. Page 6: I get the impression that there is too much detail here, and some of the
descriptors of the sample etc, should be moved to the methods section of the paper or
deleted e.g. from line 8 to line 36.
Some information is repeated eg: line 52 “We analyse data from more than 1700
participants making it the largest study of its kind…”.
The final paragraph of the introduction has been shortened to only include relevant
details. Other methodological information has been removed or moved to the method
section as appropriate.
In addition, the final lines of the introduction seem to summarise the findings of the
current study and I would suggest removing this. In my opinion a clear statement of
the aims such as in line 46: “The aim of this study was to explore potential differences
across restraint measures so that we could help to identify the most appropriate
prescreening tool for eating-related interventions” is sufficient for the introduction and
leave all the details about sample selection etc. for the methods.
We have taken the advice of reviewers 1 and 2 and have re-written the final section of
the introduction as follows:
‘The aim of this study was to explore potential differences across restraint measures so
that we could help to identify the most appropriate prescreening tool for eating-related
interventions. In accordance with previous research we expected to find that the RS was
more strongly associated with disinhibited eating and BMI compared to the DEBQRE.’
Methods
Participants
1. I would suggest removing the information regarding the prescreening as it does not
seem relevant.
This has been removed.
2. The participant section could be restructured to something like: There were four
samples included in this study. Sample 1 (N=xxx) consisted of staff and students from
Cardiff university (x% female, age mean, range). Sample 2 (N=xx) included of
undergrad psychology students (x% female, age mean, range). Sample 3 etc…
Overall, the total sample was XXX. Table 1 shows the different measures available in
the different samples”
Thank you for your suggestion, this section has been simplified as detailed above. We
have retained the information detailing that participants responded to an advert on food
and positive emotion because we believe that this has implications for how the sample
could potentially be biased (also now covered in the discussion).
Measures and materials
Please add an example item for each of the mentioned scales so the readers unfamiliar with
field can get an insight in what a typical question might be like.
Example questions have been added to all questionnaires including for each subscale.
Analyses
I would suggest breaking up the analyses section with subheading so it is easier to follow, as
it was done in the results section: Internal consistency, Factor structure, Similarities and
differences between scales, Statistical power
This section has now been restructured with subheadings.
Results
Before giving more details of the results, a summary table of all data included would be useful
including scores on scales, ages, %sex etc for the four samples.
A summary table of results has been added at the beginning of the results section.
Overall, the results sections sometimes veers into discussing the results, such as “Consistent
with previous findings…” (page 11, line 36). I would suggest removing these and keeping them
for the discussion.
Comments related to existing literature have been maintained for the internal
consistency, factor analysis and demographic difference sections to demonstrate that our
findings are comparable. These findings are not raised in the discussion - for clarity we
have concentrated on the main aims/ findings of the study in the discussion. Other such
comments have been moved from the results section into the discussion.
As a reader, I would have preferred to have Table S.5 in the main manuscript instead of Table
2, as it shows all correlations across all measures, which I feel, might be seen as the main
results and should be put to the forefront.
Thank you for this suggestion, this table has now been added to the main manuscript.
Discussion
I would suggest removing the first sentence and references and starting with “In the largest…”
The first paragraph of the discussion has been rewritten:
‘In the largest study of its kind, we reveal that although the RS and DEBQRE are highly
correlated with one another, there are also significant differences between the two
measures. In support of existing literature we demonstrate that the RS is more strongly
associated with external and disinhibited eating, food craving and BMI, when compared
to the DEBQRE…’
Page 16, line: 26: I would be worried about over-interpreting the non-significant associations
between DEBQRE and BMI and their direction. Please rephrase.
This has now been rephrased:
‘Associations with the DEBQRE did not reach statistical significance.’
Page 17, last sentence: Maybe change “The Restraint Scale” in to RS for consistency.
This has been changed.
Overall, I am missing critical evaluation of the study. What were the biggest strength and
limitations of this work? For example, it seems that the ratio between men and women was
unbalanced, as seen in Table S.4. The majority of the sample were women, which also rated
higher on all the different scales. What effect would that have on the validity of the scales? Is
one questionnaire maybe more relevant for men versus women? Just a few points to consider.
We have now included a paragraph in the discussion on limitations and future directions.
Reviewer: 2
My strongest concerns lie within the Introduction, as I feel that the Introduction lacks focus and could
be significantly streamlined and also lacks scientific hypotheses to frame the research study. Other,
more minor concerns are detailed in the review.
Responses to these comments are addressed below.
Overall Comments
Please be sure to use person-first language throughout the manuscript when describing weight
status in persons. For example, it would be preferable to use the phrase “individuals with obesity”
(vs. obese individuals).
This has now been rephrased as “adults with morbid obesity”
This is very minor, but please spell out the first use of body mass index before using the abbreviation
of BMI.
This has been done in the abstract and the first instance in the main manuscript.
Introduction
The authors clearly are well-versed in the dietary restraint literature and the Introduction contains a
lot of wonderful information about dietary restraint. At the same time, the Introduction feels a bit
unfocused and quite long. I think the manuscript would be much improved if the Introduction were
streamlined.
The introduction has now been reduced in length. We have removed the second
paragraph and condensed the final two paragraphs consistent with reviewer 1’s
comments.
I also would love for the authors to enumerate hypotheses at the end of the Introduction to help
frame the study. Based on the prior research, what did you think you might find?
We have added a hypothesis to the end of the introduction regarding disinhibited eating
and BMI as these variables were supported by the literature:
‘In accordance with previous research we expected to find that the RS was more strongly
associated with disinhibited eating and BMI compared to the DEBQRE.’
We have not added hypotheses regarding chocolate craving or external eating because
these were exploratory questions which we did not have a priori hypotheses for.
In the first paragraph, I also disagree with the statement that “Overall, rigid diets are not only
ineffective for weight loss…” Prescribed, medically monitored very-low calorie diets are effective in
promoting weight loss in the short-term. The authors may want to revise this sentence to say that
rigid diets are not effective in the long-term (or something of the like).
We cannot find any comments on rigid diets within the manuscript.
Method
I would like to see more evidence of reliability and validity of scale scores presented in the description
of each measure. Moreover, I would like for internal consistency values to be separated and specified
within the description of each measure.
Measures of internal consistency and test-retest reliability have been added to the
measures where available. We have also referred the reader to discussions on validity for
the RS, which are beyond the scope of this paper.
Please report body mass index descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, range) for each
sample in the Method section rather than in the Results section. BMI is a standard demographic
variable for study such as this.
We only have BMI statistics for two of the samples included (one self-report and one
measured) and have therefore not included BMI statistics in the participants section. In
line with reviewer 1’s comments we have added them to a summary table of descriptive
statistics at the beginning of the results.
How were missing data handled? I am sure there were some missing data across the four different
samples and large overall sample size.
The treatment of missing data has been added to the statistical analysis section:
‘To account for missing data across questionnaires, all correlations use individual mean
scores rather than the total scores. Cases were removed from analyses where no data was
available.’
What were the fit statistics of the reported factor analyses? Did the authors use parallel analysis to
determine the number of factors to extract?
Details of the factor analysis have been moved to the statistical analysis section to make
these more apparent and KMO values are reported in the supplementary information:
‘The factor structure of the RS and DEBQRE were explored using principle components
analysis with varimax rotation in accordance with previous research (Allison et al., 1992;
Blanchard & Frost, 1983; Laessle et al., 1989; Ruderman, 1983). Factors were extracted
based on having eigenvalues greater than 1.’
Were study measures completed online or in-person?
This information has now been added to the procedure:
‘All participants completed the questionnaires remotely. Those in samples 2 and 3
completed the questionnaires via an internet survey whereas those in sample 1 could
choose to answer the questionnaires electronically via email, in hard copy or via an

Results were somewhat overwhelming in the way that they were presented. The authors might
consider a more concise presentation of their results.
We have now included a summary table of all results to help the reader (Table 3). We
have also removed / moved elements to help streamline the results where possible.
Discussion
Throughout the Discussion, the authors should tone down their conclusions given that this a cross-
sectional study.
We have ensured that cautious and associative language is used throughout the
