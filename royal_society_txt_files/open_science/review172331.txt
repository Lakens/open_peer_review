In the present study, the authors examine whether search behaviour in a virtual reality
environment is comparable to search behaviour in a 2D environment using the same stimuli.
Participants were asked to search for two different targets (soda, and yoghurt) among five
distractor objects. The distractors either shared the target colour (low discriminability condition)
or not (high discriminability condition). Furthermore, an irrelevant distractor (i.e., the flanker)
was shown adjacent to the search display. This flanker was either congruent (same colour as the
target colour), or incongruent (different colour). In Experiment 1, the authors measured search
performance in a virtual reality environment. In Experiment 2, they measured search
performance in a ‘standard’ 2D environment (using the same stimuli as in Exp 1). Eye-
movements were recorded in Experiment 2 only.
In both experiments, search was slower when the target colour was the same as the distractor
colours (low discriminability condition) than when the target colour was different (high
discriminability condition). Furthermore, a flanker effect was observed in both experiments,
indicating that RTs in incongruent condition were significantly longer than in the congruent
condition. Interestingly, eye-movement analyses in Experiment 2 revealed that these flanker
effects were predominantly due to allocating covert attention to the flanking distractor. Taken
together, the authors draw the conclusion that search behaviour in VR environments is
comparable to search behaviour in 2D environments.
The present study addresses an interesting topic regarding visual search in VR and 2D
environments. The manuscript is clearly written and the analyses are well conducted. Below I
specify some issues, all of them are minor. Perhaps the most important point is that some more
discussion is needed to strengthen the manuscript. I recommend to publish this manuscript (after
revision) in Royal Society Open Science.
Issues:
The following papers are relevant to the present study. Regarding visual search in VR and and
2D environments: Li, Aiver, Kit, Tong & Hayhoe (2016, JoV), Figueroa, Aellano & Calinisan (2017,
Advances in Human Factors in Simulation and Modelling) and Kit, Katz, Sullivan, Snyder,
Ballard & Hayhoe (2014, PLoS One). Regarding the comparison between CRT and VR: Foerster,
Poth, Behler, Botsch & Schneider 2017, Sci Rep). Discussing these studies will definably
strengthen the discussion, which at the moment is very minimal.
Did some of the participants participate in both experiments? If so, it would be interesting to
examine whether the search performance correlates between the two different experiments.
Please specify the luminance for each colour?
It would be interesting to conduct some spatial analyses. Intuitively, I expect that objects nearby
(especially in the VR environment) are earlier processed than objects far away. In line with this, I
can also imagine that distractor objects are less distracting when the target is presented nearby.
Was that the case? Furthermore, was there an effect of target flanker distance? With regard to the
visual crowding literature, one might expect that it is difficult to identify an object in the
periphery when it is surrounded by neighbouring distractors if they have the same identity as the
target (see Van der Burg, Olivers and Cass, 2017, for an example of crowding in a dense display).
3
As a result, participant must make a time consuming eye-movement to the target object, which is
not necessary when the flanking object is presented far from the target.
The authors propose that search behaviour in a virtual reality environment is comparable to
search behaviour in a 2D environment using the same stimuli. Although I agree that the results
obtained from Exp 1 are very similar to Exp 2, it would be very interesting to conduct a between
experiment analyses in order to examine whether search behaviour was indeed exactly the same.
What is the rational for using a search task with two different targets? Regarding natural scenes, I
believe it is more realistic (or common) to do a present absent search task instead.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The topic of ecological validity of psychological findings and how VR can be used to bridge the
gap between experimental laboratory findings and cognition in the real world is very current.
The authors make a good case in the introduction for addressing this issue and for comparing
immersive VR tasks with more traditional 2D versions of the same tasks. However, I think that it
would be useful if the authors provided some specific prediction regarding the similarity or
differences of the effects that should be observed in these two conditions. In relation to the point
above, it would be beneficial to make it clearer whether the study aims at showing that 2D
studies are ecological valid as their results can be replicated in VR or if it is to show that VR offers
a more ecologically valid context for studying cognitive skills and to develop new tasks that
should be used in alternative to traditional 2D versions of them.
What I found a little confusing is that the authors introduce new concepts and variables in the
text at later stages, which have not been provided a rationale for in the introduction. Thus, age is
introduced as a variable of interest at the end of the results of experiment one and predictions
about eye movements in the 2D experiment are only mentioned in the introduction of experiment
4
2. Some of these variables seem to have been assessed opportunistically. If age is an important
variable to consider, why no effort was made in experiment 2 to have a similar age range as in
experiment one to allow for corresponding analyses in the two experiments? I believe that the
paper would be strengthened if the importance of these variables was outlined in the general
introduction with a clear indication of the theoretical implications of different possible patters of
results.
The study is methodologically sound and appropriate statistical analyses have been used
correctly. Thus, from this point of view I believe that it is worthy of publication. Nonetheless, I
am left with the impression that the authors missed the opportunity to compare the 2D task of
experiment 2 with VR versions of it that manipulated the scale of the display. For example, the
2D search task of experiment 2 could have been compared with a large-scale version of the task
where participants had to search for objects while navigating in the environment. With more
variations of the task that included testing for search at different environmental scales, this study
would probably have wider theoretical implications and produce more impact on the readership
of this journal.
On the basis of the comments above, I suggest that the authors could do the following to
strengthen the paper:
1) Outline clearly in the introduction the aim of the study in relation to the comparison of 2D and
immersive version of the task.
2) Explain in the general introduction the importance of assessing age effects.
3) Introduce the importance of assessing eye movements in the 2D version of the experiment
from the outset and predicted patterns of eye movements.

Response to reviews
Response to Reviewer 1
Thank you very much for your comments and suggestions and for recommending publication after
evision. We have addressed all of your comments and marked the relevant sections in the paper that
were changed in response to the reviews.
The following papers are relevant to the present study. Regarding visual search in VR and and
2D environments: Li, Aiver, Kit, Tong & Hayhoe (2016, JoV), Figueroa, Aellano & Calinisan
2017, Advances in Human Factors in Simulation and Modelling) and Kit, Katz, Sullivan,
Snyder, Ballard & Hayhoe (2014, PLoS One). Regarding the comparison between CRT and VR:
Foerster, Poth, Behler, Botsch & Schneider 2017, Sci Rep). Discussing these studies will
definably strengthen the discussion, which at the moment is very minimal.
Thank you very much for alerting us to those papers. We have considered each paper in our
manuscript now in the introduction an in the discussion sections (references 20, 22, 23 and 24) and
we hope that we did so in the way you envisioned.
Did some of the participants participate in both experiments? If so, it would be interesting to
examine whether the search performance correlates between the two different experiments.
No, the participants only participated in one of the experiments.
Please specify the luminance for each colour?
Unfortunately, we are not able to measure the luminance for each colour and can only provide RGB
values.
t would be interesting to conduct some spatial analyses. Intuitively, I expect that objects
nearby (especially in the VR environment) are earlier processed than objects far away. In line
with this, I can also imagine that distractor objects are less distracting when the target is
presented nearby. Was that the case? Furthermore, was there an effect of target flanker
distance? With regard to the visual crowding literature, one might expect that it is difficult to
dentify an object in the periphery when it is surrounded by neighbouring distractors if they
have the same identity as the target (see Van der Burg, Olivers and Cass, 2017, for an example
of crowding in a dense display). As a result, participant must make a time consuming eye-
movement to the target object, which is not necessary when the flanking object is presented
ar from the target.
Thank you very much for those suggestions. We performed the recommended analyses and are
eporting them in the results and discussion sections. As for eye movements, you will see that we only
carried out spatial analyses for fixations to the target as the number of data points for the fixations to
lanker analyses was very low (as stated before). We contemplated whether we should include
hypotheses about possible spatial effects in the introduction and then decided against doing so
because we performed these analyses post-hoc after data collection. We hope that you will agree with
our decision.
The authors propose that search behaviour in a virtual reality environment is comparable to
search behaviour in a 2D environment using the same stimuli. Although I agree that the results
obtained from Exp 1 are very similar to Exp 2, it would be very interesting to conduct a
between experiment analyses in order to examine whether search behaviour was indeed
exactly the same.
We conducted an analysis to compare both experiments and observed no effects of the factor
experiment.
What is the rational for using a search task with two different targets? Regarding natural
scenes, I believe it is more realistic (or common) to do a present absent search task instead.
Apart from visual search we were also interested in distraction as it is investigated with the flanker
paradigm. In such studies it is common to have two designated target, i.e., letters such as N or X and
congruent/incongruent flanker. We wished to also transfer this paradigm to immersive VR. To our
knowledge this is a novel aspect of our study.
Response to Reviewer 2
Thank you very much for your comments and suggestions. We are happy to hear that you consider
our paper addressing a current topic of interest. We have responded to all of your comments and
marked the relevant sections in the paper that were changed in response to the reviews.
The topic of ecological validity of psychological findings and how VR can be used to bridge the
gap between experimental laboratory findings and cognition in the real world is very current.
The authors make a good case in the introduction for addressing this issue and for comparing
mmersive VR tasks with more traditional 2D versions of the same tasks. However, I think that
t would be useful if the authors provided some specific prediction regarding the similarity or
differences of the effects that should be observed in these two conditions.
We are now providing such a prediction in the introduction. Based on previous work we would expect
a similar pattern of results for both experiments with potentially better performance in VR.
n relation to the point above, it would be beneficial to make it clearer whether the study aims
at showing that 2D studies are ecological valid as their results can be replicated in VR or if it is
o show that VR offers a more ecologically valid context for studying cognitive skills and to
develop new tasks that should be used in alternative to traditional 2D versions of them.
Thank you for alerting us that this point is confusing in our manuscript. We actually had the latter in
mind. We wanted to test whether paradigms as usually run in 2D studies can be transferred to VR and
ypical effects can be shown. Based on this, we believe that now we can develop the tasks further and
use options that only VR offers. We are hoping to make this point clearer now in the introduction and
he conclusion section.
What I found a little confusing is that the authors introduce new concepts and variables in the
ext at later stages, which have not been provided a rationale for in the introduction. Thus, age
s introduced as a variable of interest at the end of the results of experiment one and
predictions about eye movements in the 2D experiment are only mentioned in the introduction
of experiment 2. Some of these variables seem to have been assessed opportunistically. If age
s an important variable to consider, why no effort was made in experiment 2 to have a similar
age range as in experiment one to allow for corresponding analyses in the two experiments? I
believe that the paper would be strengthened if the importance of these variables was outlined
n the general introduction with a clear indication of the theoretical implications of different
possible patters of results.
n Experiment 1 age effects were assessed post-hoc. When conducting Experiment 1, participants of
different ages signed up for our study, inspiring us to look at age effects. In fact, we would consider
his post-hoc analysis rather explorative. However, we completely agree with you that the assessment
of age effects is an important topic as we ourselves have conducted studies about aging and attention
n the past. We thus added a sentence to the discussion of Experiment 1 and the conclusion section,
pointing out the importance of age effects. We decided against elaborating on this factor in the
ntroduction because, admittedly, this factor was not part of the initial design of the study. We feel that
f we now elaborate on age effects in the general introduction it will be confusing for the reader as to
why age was not addressed in Experiment 2. We hope you will agree with our decision.
As for eye movements, we were not able to monitor eye movements in the VR environment and
herefore decided, for the sake of clarity, to only introduce this measurement in the introduction of
Experiment 2, in which we would then actually monitor eye movements. We have now moved this part
o the general introduction and have also extended it.
The study is methodologically sound and appropriate statistical analyses have been used
correctly. Thus, from this point of view I believe that it is worthy of publication. Nonetheless, I
am left with the impression that the authors missed the opportunity to compare the 2D task of
experiment 2 with VR versions of it that manipulated the scale of the display. For example, the
2D search task of experiment 2 could have been compared with a large-scale version of the
ask where participants had to search for objects while navigating in the environment. With
more variations of the task that included testing for search at different environmental scales,
his study would probably have wider theoretical implications and produce more impact on the
eadership of this journal.
Thank you for this comment. We completely agree that more variables could have been tested and we
are hoping to do so in the future. Our goal for now, to first transfer traditional paradigms into VR, may
be somewhat modest but we felt that this is where we have to start.
On the basis of the comments above, I suggest that the authors could do the following to
strengthen the paper:
1) Outline clearly in the introduction the aim of the study in relation to the comparison
of 2D and immersive version of the task.
We extended the elaboration of this issue in the introduction and conclusion section.
2) Explain in the general introduction the importance of assessing age effects.
We are emphasizing the importance of assessing age effects in the conclusion section now but not in
he general introduction, as explained above. We hope that you will find our rationale acceptable.
3) Introduce the importance of assessing eye movements in the 2D version of the
experiment from the outset and predicted patterns of eye movements.
We have now moved the introduction of eye movement measurements to the general introduction and
have also extended this part in the introduction to Experiment 2.
