This manuscript provides a detailed description of the spatiotemporal aggregation dynamics of a
terrestrial species of isopods in 4 different environments showing that the dynamics are largely
independent of habitat heterogeneity. This is an interesting finding and the experiments seem to
be well conducted and the data collection and analyses have been done rigorously. It raises
interesting questions about why the environment has relatively little effect on aggregation
patterns suggesting that the social component is (at least in these environments) is a more
important driver of social organization. I have mostly minor comments. My only main concern is
the lack of methodological details.
Introduction:
Though the introduction is satisfying, I failed to see what the authors expected to find. While
reading the introduction we get an idea of the importance of biotic and abiotic drivers of social
organization but at the end there is no clear predictions given for the experiments. I think it
would be good to formulate a priori expectations (unless there was no information available)
rather than stating that you studied this topic and already stating the results.
Methods:
The methods are unsatisfying and several essential pieces of information are missing. Ideally, the
methods provide enough detail so that studies can be replicated as closely to the original as
possible. Now, the experimental design is unclear. How many trials were done per treatment?
What was the order of treatments? In which period of the year were the experiments done? What
time of day were experiments done? Why did the authors decide on a period of 45 min whereas
for some patterns (e.g. Fig. S3C, Fig. S3H) no stability seems to have been reached yet.
L. 118-120. What do the authors mean with this control? I do not understand what the authors
did. Nor do the authors follow up on this in the remainder of the manuscript. (Unless I am
overlooking something).
Also a description of how “area per individual” (l. 174) was calculated would be useful. This
measure sounds a bit confusing. Do the authors mean density with this measure?
Results:
L. 163-164. Could the authors provide a statistical test for their conclusion that there is no
difference between the 4 setups? Looking at Fig. 3a I would expect that there are differences
between setups so I am not sure if pooling is appropriate
l. 174. How was this area per individual calculated? And is this the equivalent of density?
L. 181-183. These sentences contradict each other.
L. 186-196. Please exclude the setup with 2 shelters from this analysis. Given the high likelihood
that the 2nd aggregate will form under the 2nd shelter, I find it unfair to include this treatment
here. Doing this will draw the spatial location of the 2nd aggregate relative to the 1st aggregate
towards 180 degrees by definition given that the 2 shelters were placed opposite each other.
Please redo the statistical analyses including only the 3 treatments to see if there are statistical
differences between the 3 remaining treatments. If there are no statistical differences I agree that
pooling the data (as is done now) is justified.
Looking at some of the figures (e.g. Fig. S3C & Fig. S3H), I wonder how the aggregates would
have developed if the experiment would have lasted longer than 45 minutes. The authors now
3
take this point in time as the basis of several analyses but an important question is whether the
observed patterns have stabilized or not at this point in time.
Discussion:
L. 276-281. Perhaps the authors can be a bit more specific what kind of law they are referring to
and back up this claim a bit more showing some statistical evidence. Now this is concluded a
little bit too quick. Also, do the authors refer to their data during the experiment or at the end of
the experiment?
I think Figure 1 can be moved to the ESM. I would suggest including some of the ESM figures in
the main text. For example Suppl Fig 3C, D, E are nice illustrations of the temporal dynamics and
could be included in the main text.
Minor comments:
There are quite a number of typos throughout the text. I listed some of them but the text should
perhaps be checked completely on this.
L. 61: “to” should be replaced with “for”
L. 65: I presume the authors mean “cue” here and not “clue”.
L. 67. Confronted WITH
L. 71. “In social species”. This is not correct. This sentence starts with “In this study”. In this
study the authors investigated one social species, so this general formulation is incorrect. (same
holds for l. 208-210)

I think this paper is fine to be published. I have a few concerns - firstly woodlice are collected
from 2 locations, can the authors provide evidence that this plays no role in the aggregation
patterns? Secondly Fig3a is not described very clearly - it took me a while to realize it was all
aggregates over the lifetime of the experiment and I imagine the axis is the aggregate size on a log
scale and is not displaying ln(aggregate size)? Also with this figure I find it strange to compare
these distributions that are found during the amalgamation phase to the stationary distributions

Abstract: In a patchy environment, how social animals manage conspecific and environmental
cues in their choice of habitat is a leading issue for understanding their spatial distribution and
their exploitation of resources. Here, we experimentally tested the effects of environmental
heterogeneities (artificial shelters) and some of their characteristics (size and fragmentation) on
the aggregation process of a common species of terrestrial isopod (Crustacea). One hundred
individuals were introduced into three different heterogeneous setups and in a homogeneous
setup. In the four setups, the populations split into two aggregates: one large (approximately 70
individuals) and one smaller (approximately 20 individuals). These aggregates were not
randomly distributed in the arena but were formed diametrically opposite from one another. The
similarity of the results among the four setups shows that under experimental conditions, the
environmental heterogeneities have a low impact on the aggregation dynamics and spatial
patterns of the isopod, merely serving to increase the probability of nucleation of the larger
aggregation at these points. In contrast, the regulation of aggregate sizes and the regular
distribution of groups are signatures of local amplification processes, in agreement with the
short-range activator and long-range inhibitor model (scale-dependent feedbacks). In other
words, we show how small-scale interactions may govern large-scale spatial patterns. This
experimental illustration of spatial self-organization is an important step toward comprehension
of the complex game of competition among groups in social species.

This manuscript provides a detailed description of the spatiotemporal aggregation dynamics of a
terrestrial species of isopods in 4 different environments showing that the dynamics are largely
independent of habitat heterogeneity. This is an interesting finding and the experiments seem to be
well conducted and the data collection and analyses have been done rigorously. It raises interesting
questions about why the environment has relatively little effect on aggregation patterns suggesting
that the social component is (at least in these environments) is a more important driver of social
organization. I have mostly minor comments. My only main concern is the lack of methodological
details.
Introduction
Though the introduction is satisfying, I failed to see what the authors expected to find. While reading
the introduction we get an idea of the importance of biotic and abiotic drivers of social organization
but at the end there is no clear predictions given for the experiments. I think it would be good to
formulate a priori expectations (unless there was no information available) rather than stating that
you studied this topic and already stating the results.
Response: We have reformulated the end of the introduction to better highlight our assumptions
(see new lines l. 70-82). We hope that the changes meet your expectations.
Methods
The methods are unsatisfying and several essential pieces of information are missing. Ideally, the
methods provide enough detail so that studies can be replicated as closely to the original as possible.
Now, the experimental design is unclear. How many trials were done per treatment? What was the
order of treatments? In which period of the year were the experiments done? What time of day were
experiments done? Why did the authors decide on a period of 45 min whereas for some patterns
(e.g. Fig. S3C, Fig. S3H) no stability seems to have been reached yet.
Response:
We agree with you. A substantial effort was made to clarify our methodology.
The number of replicates (in addition to Tab. 1 and Fig. 1) was inserted in the text (see new lines l.
101, l. 104, l. 111 and l. 114). The experimental period has been also added as well as the mixed
order of experimental conditions performed (see new lines l. 120-121).
Here, we focused on the initiation of the process. We decide arbitrarily and by convention on a
period of 45 min according to our previous studies (see e.g., Devigne et al., 2011; Broly et al., 2015)
in which we observe a plateau phase after about ten minutes for smaller densities. However, we
totally agree with you: after 45 min, the system is probably not at its equilibrium state. In viewing
dynamics experiments per experiments, we observe that the majority of experiments are in their
plateau phase at the 45th minute, but several experiments are not. We discussed that at the end of
the text and suggested experiments on longer periods (see l. 302-309).
L. 118-120. What do the authors mean with this control? I do not understand what the authors did.
Nor do the authors follow up on this in the remainder of the manuscript. (Unless I am overlooking
something).
Response: You are right. This control was made because a simple counting of the number of
individuals by time step is sometimes criticized. This control involves and supposes a minimal
perceptual distance between two individuals (often around the body length including or not the
antennas) as developed in Jeanson et al., 2005 or Depickere et al., 2004. However, here, the two
methods give similar results. Because, indeed, this semi-automatic analysis is not exploited in the
manuscript, we removed it for better clarity.
Also a description of how “area per individual” (l. 174) was calculated would be useful. This measure
sounds a bit confusing. Do the authors mean density with this measure?
Response: How the area per individual was calculated has been added in new lines l. 137-138. This
measurement could be an approximation of the density of individuals within the aggregate at the
ground level (although keeping in mind that the measurement of the surface area was made on 2D
whereas the aggregate has a 3D shape due to stacking of individuals (see Broly et al., 2014).
Results
L. 163-164. Could the authors provide a statistical test for their conclusion that there is no difference
between the 4 setups? Looking at Fig. 3a I would expect that there are differences between setups
so I am not sure if pooling is appropriate
Response: A quantitative analysis shows that there are some statistical differences between the
four data. However, the four data present a similar exponential law, suggesting the same
underlying rule. Especially, the value of the parameters of the exponential are very close (78.06 < a
< 91.18 and -0.0256 < b < -0.0394). We clarified that in the text. However, in figure, we kept the
mean to show the main trends of the data.
l. 174. How was this area per individual calculated? And is this the equivalent of density?
Response: see above.
L. 181-183. These sentences contradict each other.
Response: Indeed. We combined the two sentences for a better clarity.
L. 186-196. Please exclude the setup with 2 shelters from this analysis. Given the high likelihood that
the 2nd aggregate will form under the 2nd shelter, I find it unfair to include this treatment here.
Doing this will draw the spatial location of the 2nd aggregate relative to the 1st aggregate towards
180 degrees by definition given that the 2 shelters were placed opposite each other. Please redo the
statistical analyses including only the 3 treatments to see if there are statistical differences between
the 3 remaining treatments. If there are no statistical differences I agree that pooling the data (as is
done now) is justified.
Response: We agree that the second shelter in the set-up 2Sh should predominantly drive the
location of the secondary aggregates. However, this result, although intuitive and in accordance
with environmental preferences of woodlice, is not trivial (see for example the aggregates formed
outside the two shelters in Fig. 5 or in Devigne et al., 2011).
The first part of the paragraph you mention already deal with statistical analysis on unpooled data,
so for each condition (see Tab. S1). Especially, these data indicate that the mean angle of the
secondary aggregates is similar for the four conditions, around 180°. As requested, we made a
statistical test to confirm the similarity of the mean angle of the 2nd aggregate for the three set-
ups (1Shs, 1Shl, 0Sh, excluding 2Sh) (see new lines l. 201-203).
Looking at some of the figures (e.g. Fig. S3C & Fig. S3H), I wonder how the aggregates would have
developed if the experiment would have lasted longer than 45 minutes. The authors now take this
point in time as the basis of several analyses but an important question is whether the observed
patterns have stabilized or not at this point in time.
Response: we totally agree with you. After 45 min, the system is probably not at its equilibrium
state. The dynamics presented in the newly Fig. 3 (transferred from the supplementary to the main
text) suggests that. We discussed this point at the end of the text and suggested experiments on
longer periods, especially in period including strong physiological stress as desiccation (see l. 302-
304).
Discussion
L. 276-281. Perhaps the authors can be a bit more specific what kind of law they are referring to and
back up this claim a bit more showing some statistical evidence. Now this is concluded a little bit too
quick. Also, do the authors refer to their data during the experiment or at the end of the experiment?
Response: We reformulated this part to a better clarity (see l. 290-300). Because the Zipf
distribution mainly refereed to punctual observation, whereas our observations are made on the
total duration of the experiments as you pointed out, we deleted this reference.
I think Figure 1 can be moved to the ESM. I would suggest including some of the ESM figures in the
main text. For example Suppl Fig 3C, D, E are nice illustrations of the temporal dynamics and could be
included in the main text.
Response: Concerning the Figure 1, we think this is an important figure for a well and quick
understanding of our four experimental conditions. A well understanding of these set-ups should
be critical for the understanding of the following data. Because the space is not a limiting resource
in Royal Society Open Science, we suggest to keep the Figure 1 in the main text.
As requested, we transferred the two figures formerly Fig. S3d and S3e from the supplementary to
the main text (see new Fig 3a and 3b).

perhaps be checked completely on this.

Comments to the Author(s)
I think this paper is fine to be published. I have a few concerns - firstly woodlice are collected from 2
locations, can the authors provide evidence that this plays no role in the aggregation patterns?
Response: It is an interesting remark. In Oniscidea, some very distant populations (as northern and
southern european populations; Denmark vs. Greece) may present some intraspecific differences
in their aggregation patterns (see Caubet et al., 2008). This result seems mainly driven by the
ambient humidity conditions of their natural habitat (Caubet et al., 2008). Here, the two
populations came from the same geographical region (Franco-Belgian border) with similar climate
and found in similar environments (urban wooded park and forest; both are found in leaf litter,
under rocks and barks). Moreover, the two populations were mixed in our rearing facility and the
tested groups are constituted by random selection from our rearing facility, so the point raised by
the reviewer#2 has probably a minor effect on our results.
Secondly Fig3a is not described very clearly - it took me a while to realize it was all aggregates over
the lifetime of the experiment and I imagine the axis is the aggregate size on a log scale and is not
displaying ln(aggregate size)? Also with this figure I find it strange to compare these distributions that
are found during the amalgamation phase to the stationary distributions of zipf's law.
Response: we corrected the name of the axis in the formerly Fig. 3a (now Fig. 4a). See also
response below.
Other minor points -
L117 - is there a more appropriate word than dislocation?
Response: we suggested the term “dispersion”.
L123 - I think all readers will understand how rankings work
Response: We agree with you. However, some of previous publication experiences show that it is
not so evident for all the reader.
Table 1 - commas/decimal points
Response: corrected.
L165 - typo 'probability that *it will ...'
Response: corrected.

SI - would be better to have a figure number for each separate figure
Response: We assume that you make reference to Figures S3 and S5. These figures are part of a
wide demonstration including text and figures. Taken independently from each others, they are of
a limited value. In addition, such presentation will lead to unnecessary multiplicity of the reference
numbers in the main text (17 supplementary references!). So, we suggest to keep 5 supplementary
figures (+ 1 table) in which 2 of them will be a unique downloadable file including several figures
and text for synthesis.
