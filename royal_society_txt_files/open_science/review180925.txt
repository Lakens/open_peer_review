In this manuscript, the authors presented a facile thermal pyrolysis routine to synthesize fluoride-
doped graphene (FG) as an efficient oxygen reduction reaction catalyst. They provided a simple
method to prepare high performance ORR catalyst, the express is clear, the materials are well
characterized, and the paper is well written, I would like to recommend this paper to be accepted
after the authors address the following issues.
(1) Regarding the pyrolysis temperature, the authors should calibrate the furnace to ensure its
reliability, after all, 1100 oC is a little high temperature for pyrolysis.
(2) The performance is just comparable to the Pt/C catalyst in alkaline medium, far away to latest
reported attractive results.“highly efficient”may be need to be revised.
(3) The binding energy of survey spectrum in Figure 4a should be extended to above 1200 eV to
identify the existence of Zn. Moreover, the authors should explain that why F was doped in
graphene but Zn was disappeared after pyrolysis.
(4) It is well known that the D band is related to the structural defects, and the G band is
attributed to the E2g mode of vibration in the sp2. The ratio of D band and G band intensity is
often used to estimate the degree of disorder in graphite. How did the authors get the ID/IG
values? The authors need to double check their results.
(5) Tafel slopes of the catalysts can be used to evaluate the catalytic activity of the catalyst. Tafel
slopes of the catalysts should be included and compared.
(6) The composition of FG should be optimized. How about different F content in the FG sample?

Comments:
In this manuscript, the authors reported fluorine-doped graphene sheets (FG) prepared by a
4
thermal pyrolysis GO process in the presence of zinc fluoride (ZnF2) as an efficient electrocatalyst
for ORR in alkaline medium. The Authors consider that the doping of fluorine in graphene
endowed it more several exposed active sites, which is conducive to the improvement of catalytic
activity. It may be published in Royal Society Open Science if the necessary modifications are
taken.
There are some observations and queries:
1. The Authors should calculate crystallite size of the three catalysts. (doi:10.1016/j.ijhydene.
2016.03.072.)
2. The Authors claimed that the FG-1100 have larger specific area. Please provide more evidences.

Dear editor,
Thank you very much for what you have done in reviewing our manuscript
(RSOS-180925) entitled “Fluorine-doped graphene with outstanding
electrocatalytic performance for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction in
alkaline solution”. Meanwhile, we also appreciate the reviewers’ comments and
suggestions that are of great importance in improving the quality of our
manuscript. Accordingly, we have made major revisions to the manuscript (in
the revised manuscript, revised parts have been marked with red color) and hope
our revised version will be suitable for publication in “Royal Society Open
Science”.
Thank you for your consideration.
Yours sincerely,

1. Regarding the pyrolysis temperature, the authors should calibrate the furnace
to ensure its reliability, after all, 1100 oC is a little high temperature for
pyrolysis.
Response 1.
We thank the review for this question for academic rigour. Actually, in order
to make our results more convincing, we paid close attention to this problem in
the course of our experiments, so we have carefully calibrated the temperature of
the furnace every time we did the experiment.
2. The performance is just comparable to the Pt/C catalyst in alkaline medium,
far away to latest reported attractive results.“highly efficient”may be need to be
revised.
Response 2.
The catalytic activity of the FG catalyst developed by us was compared with
the similar literature as shown in electronic supplementary material (Table S1),
and its performance is close to that of the catalysts in the literature. Considering
the reviewer's request for this issue, we have changed “highly efficient” to
“efficient” (See the title).
3. The binding energy of survey spectrum in Figure 4a should be extended to
above 1200 eV to identify the existence of Zn. Moreover, the authors should
explain that why F was doped in graphene but Zn was disappeared after
pyrolysis.
Response 3.
We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. According to the
reviewer's suggestion, we have extended the survey spectrum to 1200 eV, and
could see from Figure 4a that there is no signal of Zn 2p. The specific reason for
the disappearance of Zn has been explained in our revised manuscript.(the
second paragraph and Figure 4a, Page 5)
4. It is well known that the D band is related to the structural defects, and the G
band is attributed to the E2g mode of vibration in the sp2. The ratio of D band
and G band intensity is often used to estimate the degree of disorder in graphite.
How did the authors get the ID/IG values? The authors need to double check their
results.
Response 4.
We have also noticed the problem proposed by the reviewer. According to the
literature, the ID/IG values were calculated by the integral area of D and G peaks,
rather than the height of peaks.
5. Tafel slopes of the catalysts can be used to evaluate the catalytic activity of the
catalyst. Tafel slopes of the catalysts should be included and compared.
Response 5.
We thank the review for this question for academic rigour. In our revised
manuscript, we acquired the Tafel curve of FG-1100, G-1100, FG-1000,
FG-1200, and Pt/C according to the SLV curves as shown in Figure S4 and
discussed it. (the second paragraph, Page 7 and Figure S4)
6. The composition of FG should be optimized. How about different F content in
the FG sample?
Response 6.
In the revised manuscript, we have optimized the doping amount of FG-1100
by adding different amount of ZnF2 in the pyrolyzed process. While fixing the
amount of GO to 30 mg, we have added 150 mg, 300 mg, 450 mg, or 900 mg
ZnF2 in the synthetic process and obtained four FG-1100 catalysts. Their
catalytic activities were researched by RDE as shown in Figure S5 and we found
that the FG-1100 catalyst added with 300 mg ZnF2 occupied a optimal catalytic
performance and discussed it (the second paragraph, Page 7 and Figure S5).
Therefore, in other experiments, we have used this catalyst as our object.
Referee 2
1. In figure 3, Lattice fringes not clear. Figure should be replaced with some
clear figure.
Response 1.
Thanks to the reviewer's reminder, we have replaced Figure 3d with a clear
figure, hoping to meet the reviewer's requirement.(See the Figure 3d)
2. In figure 4c, F-C bond should be mentioned as the other figures.
Response 2.
F-C bond of F1s spectrum was also described as shown in the blue font in the
revised manuscript. (the second paragraph, Page 5)
3. Scan rates for CV and LSV should be mentioned in figure 5.
Response 3.
The scan rates for CV and LSV were 10 mV·s-1, described in Section 2.4. At
the request of the reviewer, we have commented again in Figure 5.
4. There are lots of typos and grammer error and the authors should revise them.
(a)p2, L53, ultrasonicates should be ultrasonicated
(b)p3, line 8,conference should be reference
(c)p3. line16, continuouse should be continuousely
(d)p4, line 30, bigger should be largger or greater
(e)p6, line30, grapheme shoud be graphene.
(f)p8,line16-20, the sentence is not clear and should be rewritten.
Response 4.
We thank the reviewer for a very good suggestion that is of great importance
in improving the quality of our manuscript. We have sought help from a native
English speaker to touch up the manuscript and hope to meet the requirements.
5. some recent references on doped carbon materials with high performance of
ORR should be cited, for example J. Mater. Chem. A, 2016, 4, 4738, ACS
Applied Materials & Interfaces,2017, 9, 38486-38498, Adv. Mater., 2015, 27,
3190 ,Nanoscale, 2014, 6, 11336 and so on.
Response 5.
We consulted the references recommended by the reviewer, and felt they have
a close relationship with our manuscript. So we cited them in our manuscript
(the first and second paragraph, Page 1).
Referee 3
1.The Authors should calculate crystallite size of the three catalysts.
(doi:10.1016/j.ijhydene.
2016.03.072.)
Response 1.
The proposal came from the reviewer is very rigorous. We calculated the
crystallite size of FG-1000, FG-1100, and FG-1200 by the Scherrer equation
based on the (002) peak, which are 54 nm, 36 nm, and 61 nm, respectively,
according to the method in the literature. (the second paragraph, Page 3)
2.The Authors claimed that the FG-1100 have larger specific area. Please
provide more evidences.
Response 2.
According to the suggestion of the reviewer, we have carried out nitrogen
adsorption -desorption experiments for FG-1100 sample. The BET surface area
of FG-1100 is 182.8 m2·g-1with a large pore size (the results as shown in
Figure S2).
3.Please give a summarization (table) about the ORR parameters of different
catalysts.
Response 3.
According to the suggestion of the reviewer, we have summarized the ORR
parameters of different catalysts and listed them in Table S2.
4. The most reference is not published in recent years and some related article
maybe helpful{[Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry 810 (2018) 62-68],
[Materials Letters 214 (2018) 209–212]}.
Response 4.
The references recommended by reviewer are closely related to our
manuscript and helped to improve the quality of the manuscripts. So we decided
to cited them in our manuscript. (the first and second paragraph, Page 1)
5. Some grammatical errors and spelling mistakes should be corrected.
Response 5.
We thank the reviewer for the constructive comment. We have sought a
native English speaker to help us revise the manuscript and hope to meet the
requirements.
