Härer et al., conducted a study to examine the variation in opsin gene expression of the Midas
cichlid as a result of ontogeny and plasticity. The authors achieved this by conducting temporal
sampling and a manipulative experiment paired with qPCR and FISH analyses of opsin
expression. In general, I found the paper to be clearly written. The results of the study are
interesting, and I think useful (particularly visual ecologists). However, I think that a simple
statistical analysis comparing the magnitude of change in opsin expression across time and
between the treatments would make the interpretation of the data a little easier and the results
more meaningful (outline in more detail below). Otherwise I have only a few generally minor
comments.
Primary comments:
Line 43 – It would be useful to state here or elsewhere in the introduction what the opsin
repertoire is for this species in terms of opsin types (SWS1, SWS2 etc).
If the authors want to suggest that the plasticity is adaptive (as suggested in the title) I think there
needs to be some bolstering of this argument in the discussion. It is debatable whether or not
‘matching’ of expression to ambient conditions (to maximize quantum catch) is a signature of
increased visual function as this may decrease the ability to detect contrast (which to the author’s
credit is briefly mentioned in the discussion). Given that we don’t know functionally what would
be more useful to these fish, quantam catch or contrast detection performance-wise, I would
argue it is unclear whether this plasticity is adaptive or not. I recommend either changing the title
or providing more clear evidence for the adaptive utility of the observed plasticity.
I understand that at some sampling time points statistical analysis was not possible due to the
sampling of a single individual. However, there is often individual level variation in opsin
expression (and sex specific variation) so it would be worthwhile to Indicate the caveats of the
sampling structure of the paper. Additionally, individual or sex related variation might help
explain the back and forth fluctuations in expression seen for SWS2a and SWS2b in the blue-to-
red treatment.
In contrast, at the beginning and end of the experimental period 6 individuals were collected and
statistical tests should be possible. Were the changes in expression statistically significant? It
would be worthwhile to indicate the magnitude of the changes in expression over time and
between the experimental treatments (with the associated statistics) in the text. Then it would be
possible to compare the relative magnitude of the shift in expression due to ontogeny vs plasticity
- a more meaningful and useful metric.
The experiment looked at fish up to 4 months of age, when do these fish sexually mature? Are
these ‘adult’ fish? It would be useful to state this somewhere in the paper. As perhaps this would
affect the likelihood that there is a later point where opsin expression would become more
permanently fixed (i.e. could no longer change).
Minor comments:
Line 23 – “respond phenotypically plastic” would make more sense as “exhibit phenotypic
plasticity”
3
Lines 29 – 32 – The message here is a little confusing, are there two separate environments during
this time? Perhaps split into two sentences.

The manuscript “Reverting ontogeny: rapid adaptive platicity of color vision in cichlid fish”
presented by Harer et al examines opsin gene expression in different light environments. I have
been watching with great interest as the authors have been building this system over the last
several years since I feel it provides a promising model for studies at the interface of evolution
and visual ecology. This study presents some very interesting and novel data (particularly the
FISH data coupled with the qPCR). I have only relatively minor comments that I feel the authors
could easily address before the manuscript is ready for publication.
L. 24, 55, 129. It’s unclear what the author’s are trying to say – that it is unknown if all species are
constrained to progression from short to long wavelength, or just A. astoriquii. Since the author’s
cite Nandamuri et al 2017 at L.129 (in which they show another cichlid species switching to short
wavelengths as adults) I’m guessing the authors meant A. astoriquii specifically. But this should
be clarified as the authors seem to be overstepping the novelty of their findings, particularly in
line 174 when they claim “This unusual ability…” which is neither unique, nor tested in many
taxa. I suggest the authors tone down the ‘uniqueness’ of a switch to shorter wavelengths
throughout and highlight that adult plasticity in visual tuning remains to be addressed across
many taxa.
Fig1C – the y axis here is labeled as proportional expression- but it’s unclear how you went from
relative to housekeeping genes to proportional single cone opsin (which I assume is what it is).
Throughout the manuscript the authors stress that they are observing plasticity after reaching an
adult phenotype. However, as authors say on L 95 “expression of the double cone opsin rh2b
4
decreased to zero in both treatments during the 14-day experimental period (which precluded
distinguishing between normal ontogenetic changes and plasticity induced by the light
treatments)”. This suggests their study was not actually starting from fully developed adult
phenotypes. I don’t think this changes the overall message of the paper, but would appreciate if
the authors could acknowledge this in their discussion as it currently has contradictory data and
statements.
When I went to find how expression values were calculated from the housekeeping values
(authors point to their previous paper) – I was slightly alarmed to see that they have not taken
into account the relative efficiencies of their different assays as this can dramatically skew their
results. While I don’t think it will alter the qualitative patterns that are the focus of this paper (the
switch), I would strongly encourage this group to incorporate the relative assay efficiencies (for
an example of how to do this properly see the paper they cited as #15 in the manuscript).
Supplementary qPCR data – In the supplementary ‘qpcr_data’ file there is a tab titled
“single_cones_exchange” with Ct values for sws2b, sws2a, gapdh2 and imp2. But under the tab
titled “double_cones_exchange” there are also Ct values for sws2b, sws2a, gapdh2 and imp2 (and
values differ between tabs). I assume the “double_cones_exchange” is actually showing rh2aB
and lws? Please also provide the assay efficiencies for the assays.
I am also confused as to why the values for gaphdh2 and imp2 differ in the single cone and
double cone data sets when they came from the same individual? Perhaps these were run on
different plates?
I am a bit alarmed to see only one value for each qPCR assay. qPCR is a highly variable
technique- each assay should be run in at least triplicate and variation in these reads must be
reported. See Bustin et al 2009. “The MIQE Guidelines: Minimum Information for Publication of
Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments”. It is my understanding that these standards are
required by the Royal Society (https://blogs.royalsociety.org/publishing/transparent-
reproducible-research/). It is already outside the norm to use qPCR measures from just one
biological replicate per time point – however I realize the patterns observed holds across days
sampled and they were coupled with FISH data that backs up the qualitative qPCR findings.

ary comments:
43 – It would be useful to state here or elsewhere in the introduction what the opsin repertoire is
his species in terms of opsin types (SWS1, SWS2 etc).
We agree with the reviewer and incorporated information on the opsin repertoire in the introduction
(lines 45-47).
e authors want to suggest that the plasticity is adaptive (as suggested in the title) I think there needs
e some bolstering of this argument in the discussion. It is debatable whether or not ‘matching’ of

ntam catch or contrast detection performance-wise, I would argue it is unclear whether this plasticity
aptive or not. I recommend either changing the title or providing more clear evidence for the
tive utility of the observed plasticity.
We agree with the reviewer that, at this point, we do not have conclusive behavioral data that
clearly shows that the observed changes are adaptive. Hence, we changed the title and also
rephrased parts of the manuscript to be more careful about the adaptive nature of the observed
changes.

S-190841): Reverting ontogeny: rapid phenotypic plasticity of color vision in cichlid fish
derstand that at some sampling time points statistical analysis was not possible due to the sampling
single individual. However, there is often individual level variation in opsin expression (and sex
ific variation) so it would be worthwhile to Indicate the caveats of the sampling structure of the
er. Additionally, individual or sex related variation might help explain the back and forth fluctuations
pression seen for SWS2a and SWS2b in the blue-to-red treatment.
We now indicate in the Methods section that our sampling design of one individual per time-point
precludes statistical analyses of opsin expression during the experimental period (lines 86-88). We
agree that there can be quite some variation among individuals (including sex-specific differences)
which might explain the high variation in the blue-to-red treatment. However, since we don’t see
such fluctuations in the red-to-blue treatment, we conclude that these fluctuations are most likely
due to random variation among individuals but might be rather explained by differences in quantum
catch as we argue in the discussion (lines 172-175).
ntrast, at the beginning and end of the experimental period 6 individuals were collected and
stical tests should be possible. Were the changes in expression statistically significant? It would be
thwhile to indicate the magnitude of the changes in expression over time and between the
rimental treatments (with the associated statistics) in the text. Then it would be possible to
pare the relative magnitude of the shift in expression due to ontogeny vs plasticity - a more
ningful and useful metric.
The reviewer is right that we have sampled six individuals at the beginning and the end of the
experimental period. While the main focus of the paper is the rapid expression changes of certain
cone opsin after switching the light conditions, we only have six individuals from groups that were
constantly maintained either in blue or red light but not from any of the exchange treatments.
However, we agree that it might be interesting to incorporate statistics to see how expression of
certain opsins is affected long-term by raising fish under different light conditions until an age of
four months and also how it might change during our experimental period. Hence, we incorporated
Scheirer-Ray-Hare tests (non-parametric alternative to ANOVA) to test the effects of light treatment
and time-points on expression of each cone opsin (lines 107-111). As mentioned above, we don’t
think that our conclusions are dependent on these results, thus, we only mention it briefly in the first
paragraph of the Discussion section (lines 139-140) but don’t discuss it further to maintain the
manuscript short.
experiment looked at fish up to 4 months of age, when do these fish sexually mature? Are these
lt’ fish? It would be useful to state this somewhere in the paper. As perhaps this would affect the
hood that there is a later point where opsin expression would become more permanently fixed (i.e.
d no longer change).
We incorporated the information on the age at which these fish commonly show an adult visual
phenotype in the revised version of the manuscript (lines 156-159). We agree with the reviewer that
phenotypic plasticity might be reduced at an older age, however, previous work by our research
group has shown that A. astorquii can exhibit phenotypic plasticity at an age of 6 months when the
visual phenotype of a sexually mature individual is reached (Härer et al. 2017 Molecular Ecology).

, 55, 129. It’s unclear what the author’s are trying to say – that it is unknown if all species are
trained to progression from short to long wavelength, or just A. astoriquii. Since the author’s cite
damuri et al 2017 at L.129 (in which they show another cichlid species switching to short
elengths as adults) I’m guessing the authors meant A. astoriquii specifically. But this should be
fied as the authors seem to be overstepping the novelty of their findings, particularly in line 174
n they claim “This unusual ability…” which is neither unique, nor tested in many taxa. I suggest the
ors tone down the ‘uniqueness’ of a switch to shorter wavelengths throughout and highlight that
t plasticity in visual tuning remains to be addressed across many taxa.
We agree that phenotypic plasticity in opsin expression has been described before but has not been
found in many species, but, it might not be that unusual once it gets tested in more species so we
removed the word “unusual” from the text (line 203). Moreover, we understand the reviewer’s
concerns but we want to argue that the point we are making about reverting ontogeny remains valid
in our eyes. The point we are making is not whether adult individuals are able to change opsin
expression towards shorter wavelengths per se but it is rather about whether this can happen in the
opposite direction of natural ontogenetic changes. Midas cichlids, as shown by our group before
(Härer et al. 2017 Molecular Ecology), but also many African cichlids (reviewed in Carleton et al.
2016 Genesis) undergo changes in opsin expression from short to long wavelength sensitivity.
However, the study species used by Nandamuri are not one of those species as they show a short
wavelength sensitive visual phenotype throughout their life and don’t change cone opsin expression
during development. So yes, the Metriaclima species from Nandamuri et al. 2017 might be able to
change opsin expression towards shorter wavelengths, however, this cannot be related to ontogeny.
Hence, we would like to emphasize that we still think that our findings of phenotypic plasticity
reverting ontogenetic changes in opsin expression are novel and have not been shown, to the best of
our knowledge, in any other species.
C – the y axis here is labeled as proportional expression- but it’s unclear how you went from relative
ousekeeping genes to proportional single cone opsin (which I assume is what it is).
The legend in Fig. 1C stating “proportional expression” is actually correct. However, we realized that
the corresponding part of the Methods section was outdated as we changed the analyses to
calculate proportional expression of the two single cone (sws2b & sws2a) and double cone opsins
(rh2aß & lws) rather than normalizing with housekeeping genes. This type of analysis gives a much
better idea and visualization of which opsin is mainly expressed and how the proportions change

over time. Hence, we changed the corresponding part in the Methods section but also in the
Supplementary Material.
ughout the manuscript the authors stress that they are observing plasticity after reaching an adult
notype. However, as authors say on L 95 “expression of the double cone opsin rh2b decreased to
in both treatments during the 14-day experimental period (which precluded distinguishing between
mal ontogenetic changes and plasticity induced by the light treatments)”. This suggests their study
not actually starting from fully developed adult phenotypes. I don’t think this changes the overall
sage of the paper, but would appreciate if the authors could acknowledge this in their discussion as
rrently has contradictory data and statements.
We understand the reviewer’s concern that talking about an adult visual phenotype might have
created confusion. However, we are convinced that our argument of observing plasticity after
reaching an adult phenotype still holds, particularly when looking at the red to blue treatment. At
both ages of 118 & 132 dph, the fish raised under red light expressed sws2a, rh2aß and lws, which
constitutes the adult phenotype in Midas cichlids. However, when putting those fishes in blue light,
they reverted to a previous state as we claim in the manuscript (lines139-141). However, we
acknowledge that the fish raised under blue light seem to have a delayed ontogenetic progression
and still change in opsin expression between 118 & 132 dph. But we want to emphasize that we do
not claim that these fishes reached an adult visual phenotype anywhere in the manuscript but we
now made it more clear that expression of rh2b only changed in the blue treatment (lines 113-114).
n I went to find how expression values were calculated from the housekeeping values (authors point
eir previous paper) – I was slightly alarmed to see that they have not taken into account the relative
iencies of their different assays as this can dramatically skew their results. While I don’t think it will
the qualitative patterns that are the focus of this paper (the switch), I would strongly encourage this
p to incorporate the relative assay efficiencies (for an example of how to do this properly see the
er they cited as #15 in the manuscript).
As mentioned further above, we actually did not use housekeeping genes for normalization but
rather only calculated proportional expression of cone opsins genes. Regarding the point of taking
into account qPCR efficiencies for the different genes, we have calculated efficiencies for all genes
and the efficiencies vary between 95 & 103 % showing that there are no strong differences in
efficiency that might substantially bias our results. However, we reanalyzed our data incorporating
efficiencies in the new version of the manuscript and also updated all qPCR results shown in Figure 1
in this context. The efficiencies are noted in the Supplementary Material.
plementary qPCR data – In the supplementary ‘qpcr_data’ file there is a tab titled
gle_cones_exchange” with Ct values for sws2b, sws2a, gapdh2 and imp2. But under the tab titled
ble_cones_exchange” there are also Ct values for sws2b, sws2a, gapdh2 and imp2 (and values differ
een tabs). I assume the “double_cones_exchange” is actually showing rh2aB and lws? Please also
ide the assay efficiencies for the assays.
We corrected the labelling of the columns in the supplementary file and as explained further above,
we have removed the housekeeping gene columns as we did not take them into account for the final
analysis of our data.
also confused as to why the values for gaphdh2 and imp2 differ in the single cone and double cone
sets when they came from the same individual? Perhaps these were run on different plates?

S-190841): Reverting ontogeny: rapid phenotypic plasticity of color vision in cichlid fish
This can be explained by the fact that we used different cDNA dilutions for measuring single and
double cone expression but, as mentioned above, we did not use the housekeeping genes in the end.
a bit alarmed to see only one value for each qPCR assay. qPCR is a highly variable technique- each
y should be run in at least triplicate and variation in these reads must be reported. See Bustin et al
9. “The MIQE Guidelines: Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR
riments”. It is my understanding that these standards are required by the Royal Society
ps://blogs.royalsociety.org/publishing/transparent-reproducible-research/). It is already outside the
m to use qPCR measures from just one biological replicate per time point – however I realize the
erns observed holds across days sampled and they were coupled with FISH data that backs up the
itative qPCR findings.
In the last version of our manuscript, we were not completely clear about the way we collected the
qPCR data. Actually, we did use two (or three in few cases) technical replicates and only reported the
mean values in the Supplementary Data. We have now altered the Supplementary Data and
incorporated all raw Ct values of the technical replicates.
