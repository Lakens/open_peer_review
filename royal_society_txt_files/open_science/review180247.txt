This manuscript investigated the crystalline modification of a novel rare nucleating agent (WBG)
based on mechanism analysis. Three self-assembly structures were discussed in this manuscript.
The authors revealed the relationship between these different self-assembly structures and the
content of ß-crystal and the crystallization morphology. The self-assembly behavior was also
studied. The results showed that the formation of self-assembly structure was based on the free
molecules by hydrogen bond dissociation or association during heating or cooling process. This
manuscript is suitable for publication in the Royal Society Open Science after addressing the
following comments:
1. Paper 4, line 10: It should be “0.1 wt% - 0.5 wt%”, instead of “0.1 wt% - 0.4 wt%”.
2. The ß-nucleated polypropylene was manufactured into bulk. The preparation process of this
bulk for WAXD analysis should be given in detail. That is important to the results of WAXD.
3. Paper 7, line 6-7: the references of the two melting peaks should be given.
4. FTIR was employed to analyze the hydrogen bond change during heating or cooling process.
Authors need provide the experimental detail of FTIR measurement in the experimental section.
5. In table 2, the content of ß-crystal increased first and then decreased from 0.1 wt% to 0.5 wt%
while the effect of self-assembly behavior on the Kß was only analyzed when the content is 0.5
wt%. Authors need provide data for other samples.

Report on the manuscript entitled as “Crystalline modification of rare earth nucleating agent for
isotactic polypropylene based on its self-assembly” by Zhang et al. submitted to Royal Society
Open Science for possible publication.
I have read this manuscript RSOS-180247 with interest. In this work, the authors investigated self-
assembly structure of WBG, and effect of WBG on the crystallization morphology, thermal
properties and crystallization structure of PP. There is an increasing need to develop more
efficient ß-nucleating agent. The author's work is encouraging according to the experimental
results, as such the work is of great interest for a good type of ß-nucleating agent according to
industry and the scientific community. I would like to recommend this manuscript for
publication in Royal Society Open Science after minor revision.
Some comments to the Authors:
1. The authors should supply the specific temperature to obtain self-assemble structure of WBG
with different content in Fig.1.
2. POM photos in Fig.6 are indistinct, the clear photos should be supplied.
3. The authors believe that the topological structure changes from needle-like structure to
dendritic structure with the increase of the content of WBG. That leads to an increase of ß-crystal
content. The authors should explain this phenomenon in detail.
4. The authors should discuss ß-crystal nucleation mechanics for different topological structure
of WBG.

Appendix A
Dear reviewer:
Thanks for your comments on our paper. It is extremely helpful, and we have revised our paper
according to your comments.
1. The temperature range of obtaining self- assembly structure in the case of
different WBG content and the trend of changes was given in page 6, line 16-18,
which was high light.
2. The more clear photos have replaced some indistinct ones.
3. The phenomenon that topological structure changed with WBG content and the ß
content changed with topological structure (needle-like structure and dendritic
structure) was explained in page 14, line 11 to 17, which was high light.
4. The nucleation mechanics for different topological structure of WBG was
elaborated from page 10 to page 11.
Sincerely yours,
Dr. Han
