Mushroom bodies, which are paired centers in insect forebrains, are famous because of their
suggested role in learning and memory. The most compelling evidence for this comes from
studies of Drosophila where targeted gene expression as well as other methods for single cell
identification demonstrates morphological identifies of neurons, to which functions pertaining to
learning and memory can be confidently ascribed. The notion that mushroom bodies are required
for cognitive functions derives not from work on fruitflies but from Dujardin’s claim in 1850 that
these centers underlie cognition. Not surprising, then, that the honey bee has been the “other”
taxon, on which numerous studies on learning and memory have been undertaken. However, the
strategies used for analyzing the honey bee mushroom bodies reflect the limitations offered by
social insects in applying methods, including targeted gene expression, to reveal functional
circuits described in terms of real neurons. Apart from some neuroanatomical studies, we are still
very much in the dark about what neurons do what in establishing learning in a honey bee’s
brain.
In this manuscript the authors rely on a number of publications in trusting that extracellular
electrodes and spike sorting can provide data to demonstrate multimodal convergence and
stimulus categorization – prerequisites for associative learning – in mushroom body output
neurons that are here referred to as MBONs, using nomenclature that Drosophila researchers use
for naming morphologically and functionally identified mushroom body output neurons.
The problem that the present manuscript presents is the contrast of identifying the functional role
of a morphologically recognized MBON (as in Drosophila) versus assuming that a recording
alone can identify a MBON, for which there is no morphological correlate. This aspect of the
present paper presents the insoluble challenges (1) of accepting as a given that the described units
are MBONs rather than other neurons, such as those supplying mushroom body; and (2) that the
electrodes are indeed where they are intended to be.
My review, such as it is, first considers (line by line) some of the premises, on which the authors
base their experiments. The second is a general comment on the experimental results and their
validity. The third briefly refers to their discussion.
The Introduction.
Line 32. What is intramodal? Variations of one modality?
Line 32. “largely completed at the level of MB input, and information at the MB output…” What
and where is the input? Evolutionarily, the input is to the lobes, not the calyx. So it is unclear
whether the authors think that the calyx is the exclusive input region. What about the evidence
for substantial inputs to the lobes as well as to the calyx?
Line 40. “While these studies revealed insight into processing of unimodal information in the
brain, in reality neuronal networks are not only confronted with single modalities at a time. “
This is a puzzling statement. Almost all learning and memory experiments involve two distinct
stimuli, often employing two distinct modalities.
Line 42. “……the neuronal machinery, for….” Please, it is not machinery!
Line 43. “..has to simultaneously analyse stimulus qualities…” Must it? This seems simplistic.
What about sequential operations, as when associations draw on memorized data to assess
3
valence? Incidentally, only one paper thus far has demonstrated that valence is encoded by
mushroom body output neurons: reference 44 (Hige et al).
Line 53. “..established and reliable extracellular multiunit recording technique [8–13].” But is it?
The spike sorting algorithms are reliable, but at this point, the ringing of alarm bells concern the
identities of neurons, which as far as I am able to determine [in 8-13], have never been adequately
demonstrated. And that is a huge concern when what is required for understanding what’s going
on in the mushroom body circuit is to ascribe responses to neuroanatomically identifiable
MBONs.
Line 55. “The group of MBONs, in the honeybee approximately 400 neurons [14], integrate
activity…..” The authors base this study on the premise that there are 400 output neurons from
the vertical lobes. There are many reasons to be worried about this estimate. In the cited paper,
clusters of cobalt-labeled cell bodies are indicated, but apart from diagrammatic connections to
the lobes, neuroanatomical evidence for these populations relating to MBONs is, at the very best,
sparse. This means that '400' cannot be secure and might be a vast overestimate. Furthermore, the
cited paper makes no distinction between output and input neurons. The assumption seems to be
that every arborization in the alpha lobe is that of an output neuron. But we know from studies of
Drosophila (and honey bees) and cockroaches that the lobes are densely populated by domains of
afferent terminals. And we know from comparative studies that the lobes receive a major, in
some species the exclusive, afferent supply.
Line 64. “….or MB ß neurons [20] (both can be seen as special clusters of MBONs),” This study
[20] is also based on extracellular recordings of neurons asserted as belonging to the beta lobe but
without any anatomical support.
Line 65. “……cross-modal integration in the honeybee has never been tested rigorously at the
neurophysiological level.” I agree. This is an urgent need. But it requires both anatomical and
physiological identification of the neuron(s).
Line 126. “that area MBON neurites are about ~10 µm thick ….” How do you know?
The Results.
There are no issues with respect to the stimulus set-up, which other than gluing the antennae (see
below) is straightforward. Nor can one challenge the use of spike sorting and statistical analysis.
These are established techniques, with which the first author has considerable experience.
However, the results raise many questions. For example, can the percentages given (lines 180-
187) show how many neurons were available for any particular recording? Can one assume that
each spike represents a neuron? After all, insect neurons have extraordinarily elaborate shapes,
and the mushroom body’s neurons are no exception, one nerve cell possibly – indeed probably –
supporting more than one spiking unit. How can the strategy of extracellular recording from
numerous active elements – I hesitate to write neurons – provide reliable data about whether
those elements are efferents or afferents? The assertion that “In that area MBON neurites are
about ~10 µm thick and induce well pronounced spike shapes in the differential recording
channels which are distinct from other neurons in that area” (lines 126, 127), has no supporting
data nor any supporting reference, so it doesn’t inspire confidence. In any event, what is being
referred to here as a neurite: an axon, dendrite, cell body fiber?
Another experimental concern pertains to the known functions of MBONs. In Drosophila, certain
classes of MBON’s signal the valence of a stimulus or stimulus combinations, and it is assumed
that such an assessment of the “value” of a stimulus combination (which valence implies)
requires many senses. Yet by affixing the antennae, the honey bee is denied a crucial exploratory
behavior by these highly mobile appendages. It’s akin to not being able to turn one’s head
towards a interesting conversation in a crowded room, to use the authors’ analogy in their
discussion. And can one simply assume that multi-electrode recordings suggesting ensemble
activity reflect the activity of a specific ensemble of MBONs? Wouldn’t one have to assume that
such an ensemble should consist of numerous neurons situated in the same activity domain,
meaning a volume of the lobe, the axons or dendrites of which are tightly clustered (could they
4
otherwise be identified as an ensemble)? That many neurons can be recorded simultaneously
would be informative if that information is put into a context that addresses circuit organization
(not conjectural, but anatomical, which is the only one that counts). And there is this
consideration: the dendrites of an efferent neuron converge onto its axon very close to, or even
just outside the boundary of the lobe. That being the case, what is generating spikes in the lobe?
The largest dendrites? If that is a possibility, then wouldn’t synchronous – aka ensemble – activity
be an expected attribute within a dendritic tree of a single nerve cell? Bear in mind that there is no
reliable data pertaining to the location or even number of spike initiating zones of an insect
neuron.
This kind of electrophysiological analysis begs for support from evidence confirming where the
electrodes are situated. Only in one previous publication by the first author has there been an
attempt to show this, and then that was a large patch of fluorescent dye. Would there be an
investment in developing a method that would reveal the structural context (in the form of axons,
branches, cytoarchitectonics) of such multiple recordings then results such as these would
assume conviction. But even then, the experimenter still would be required to determine if
she/he is recording from afferent or efferent neurons. The elephant in the room is the number of
inputs that invade the lobes. To assume that extrinsic neurons are always outputs would be a
grievous error. The analysis demands an algorithm that can distinguishes spikes generated by a
MBON from those carried by a MBIN. But this probably wishful thinking.
The Discussion.
The discussion illustrates, like no other part of this paper, that the authors can only surmise the
location of the recorded neurons. The absence of any definitive clue as to what these are, how
many there might be, and where they are located (it’s important because their location would
inform where their axons project) is extremely worrying. Published data show that in those slabs
of the lobes that represent the lip, collar and basal ring, arborizations of both input and output
neurons are highly variable, some interacting with two slabs, others all three, rarely with just one.
Only neurons of the gamma lobe appear restricted just to it. These aspects illustrate that knowing
what neurons the recordings sample is paramount. The Discussion here demonstrates that, so far,
this isn’t known and that any interpretation relies on conjecture. On the brighter side, if there is
any laboratory with the expertise for developing a reliable method to resolve this dilemma, the
Rössler lab would be the one to do it.

The manuscript by Strube-Bloss and Rößler entitled “Multimodal integration and stimulus
categorization in mushroom body output neurons of the honeybee” is an interesting paper that
extracellular electrophysiology to characterize responses of units in the mushroom body vertical
lobes to visual and olfactory cues. The paper is clearly written and well illustrated. The methods
are solid and the conclusions are in line with the results. I have one major point and a few minor
issues that would need to be addressed, but all of these should be easily fixed by the authors.
Major point
- electrode placement verification
1) The location of the recordings is not well described (“…at the ventral aspect of the vertical
lobe…”; was the electrode placed inside the vertical lobe, or near it? I’m not sure what is meant
by ‘ventral aspect’. Please provide a better description.
2) Along the same lines: With extracellular recordings it is obviously impossible to verify the
identity of the recorded neurons. However, it is essential to verify the correct placement of the
electrode by examining the brains after the experiment. This is especially important as the lateral
accessory lobe is located very close to the ventral part of the VL; a region that contains many
visual and likely also olfactory neurons; if the electrode was misplaced by a few micrometers,
those regions could have been accidentally targeted.
I am sure the authors have done this verification step, so it should be possible to show the
insertion site of the electrode in the recorded brains. Please provide either histological images of
the recording sites that verify the location of the electrode, or provide at least a schematic
illustration that illustrates the electrode placements in each bee.
Minor points
Introduction
line 39: the references to visual input are arbitrary; moreover, the Seelig and Jayaraman paper
makes an explicit point about the multimodal nature of the head-direction cells studied in the
paper (these cells work in the absence of visual information, thus they must integrate
proprioceptive cues with visual cues). Thus this paper is not a good example supporting the
statement of the authors. Reference 1 seems a rather random example of a paper that studies
visual neurons in mice. A review that summarizes processing underlying visually driven
behaviors would be more suited.
line 41: “..neuronal networks are not only confronted with single modalities…” Not true in all
cases; there are circuits that deal with only one modality (sensory systems…). Please me more
specific as to which circuits you refer to.
line 52-53: The sentence starting with “We therefore…” was confusing to me, as it is not clear at
this point why the MB-output neurons are the first site of integration. This becomes clear later on,
6
so this sentence should be moved after the explanation that the sensory inputs remain segregated
in the Calyx and the Kenyon cells.
It should be mentioned somewhere whether the experiments were done on naive or experienced
bees, or whether the state of the bees was not controlled in any way. This is crucial for the
interpretation of the results, especially when neurons are recorded that might encode learned
valences of stimuli. This sets the expectations of the reader and provides essential context for
interpretation of the data.
Methods:
line 94: what is the unit of the concentration? g/l, mol/l, or is it just a 100x dilution?
line 111: synchronize not synchronized
line 125: see major comment on description of recording site
line 151: what is the alpha function and the resolution tau? Please provide a bit more detail.
line 151: why were the recordings baseline corrected? Was the background activity so variable
across trials? If so, that might indicate either damaged cells, a large population of different cells
pooled in the dataset, or different states of the circuit in different bees. This should be discussed.
section after 154: The description of how the population vectors were computed is not clear to
me. Please explain in a way that is more accessible to a broader audience. What is an ’n-
dimensional rate vector’?
general: How was the quality of the recordings assessed? What were criteria for
inclusion/exclusion of data (aside from the spike sorting criteria). If recordings with drifting
baselines were included, this might mask neural responses during some stages of the recording.
Please add the used criteria to the methods.
Why were the used colors and odors chosen? Is there anything particularly relevant about those
odors? Are the flower related? Innate preferences?
Results/Discussion
general: It does not come across very clearly which information was fed into the PCA, so that it is
not very intuitive to interpret some of the results. After a few reads I think I understood that only
the baseline-corrected peak firing was used. I doubt that the temporal structure of the responses
was disregarded, but cannot really find this information. Either way, this should be stated more
explicitly in the results/figures and in the methods.
line 255: ‘specific’ There is no indication in the data that these cells encode specific combinations.
On the contrary, they seem to encode all combinations of olfactory and visual cues (at least across
the presented stimuli). Please reword.
line 280: “Since MBONs in naive…” this sentence should be part of the introduction, as it sets the
expectations and hypothesis for the paper.
lines 284 following: I am a little unsure what a category ‘light’ would actually mean. You tested
color, but the neurons don’t seem to care about color. But the mere presence of light is not a
meaningful stimulus for the bee (other than signaling that it is outside the hive). What would
7
happen if you showed behaviorally relevant objects to the MBONs? Also, bees are known to have
an innate preference to the color blue. However, there is no indication that this is reflected in the
neuron’s activity. Overall, the term categorization in combination with valence coding implies
that behaviorally relevant categories are formed, but there is no indication of that in the data.
Please discuss the relevance of the encoded information more deeply.
lines 311 and following: The anatomical divisions of the vertical lobe don’t appear to be
concentric, at least according to one of the most details studies of the honeybee vertical lobe
projections (Strausfeld NJ. Organization of the honey bee mushroom body: representation of the
calyx within the vertical and gamma lobes. The Journal of Comparative Neurology 2002;450:4–33.
doi:10.1002/cne.10285.). Rather they seem to contain horizontal layers that represent the portions
of the calyx. The visual regions would be most dorsally represented, while the ventral regions are
olfactory (the most ventral rim represents the gamma lobe though). So, it is a bit unexpected that,
given the ventral placement of the electrode) that only so few cells responded to the olfactory
stimuli only. This is another reason for requiring more detailed information on the placement of
the electrodes.
line 325: where would this ‘early’ combination of olfaction with vision be achieved? The calyx
would be the only realistic possibility; but then, are the authors suggesting that the neurons of the
lip integrate vision as well?
So either there is a bias in the recordings that for some reason leads to an underrepresentation of
purely olfactory MBONs, or some MBONs would need to pick up information form more than
one VL-layer. Are such neurons known? Is there anything known about how many cells
innervate the different layers of the VL (vertical lobe)?
There is only a very limited discussion of what is known from Drosophila. The valence coding of
MB-output cells was thoroughly described in that species and a more detailed comparison seems
essential to give relevance to the bee-results presented here.
Open data section
It seems an unnecessary barrier for open access to require contacting the University IT
department for access to the files. It would be highly desirable to deposit the data (additionally)
in a truly open access repository (such as figshare.com). In either case, please provide information
about how the datasets will be annotated, what are the identifiers used to pinpoint the relevant
files? As it is, there is no realistic way in accessing the files for actual reuse.

mean might overstate the precision of the cells (especially given the raw data in panel A, which
seems rather noisy)

suggestion for E: It would be nice to project the model onto a anatomically more realistic
illustration; i.e. one that includes the layered structure of the VL as well as the spatial segregation
of visual and olfactory regions in the Calyx.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
This is a tricky case, with polarised views of the two reviewers. I read the article and it seems that
it is a well-performed study within the (substantial) technical constraints of the honeybee nervous
system for relating function to anatomy. I think Reviewer 1 holds the ms to an impossibly high
standard for this journal, and propose that the authors should be allowed to chance to revise their
manuscript where reasonably possible and otherwise highlight more carefully the caveats of the
interpretations of their electrophysiological recordings.
Subject Editor Comments to Author:
As mentioned by the AE, this is a difficult one as the reviewers are polarised. Both reviewers
9
recommend a number of changes, which means it is impossible to accept the manuscript in its
present form. The first reviewer, despite listing a number of major issues, is positive on some
aspects, while the second reviewer only requires minor changes. Therefore on balance I am
happy to go with the AE recommendation of allowing resubmission, addressing as many
comments raised by the reviewers as possible.

The manuscript by Strube-Bloss and Rößler entitled “Multimodal integration and stimulus
categorization in mushroom body output neurons of the honeybee” is an interesting paper that
extracellular electrophysiology to characterize responses of units in the mushroom body vertical
lobes to visual and olfactory cues. The paper is clearly written and well illustrated. The methods
are solid and the conclusions are in line with the results. I have one major point and a few minor
issues that would need to be addressed, but all of these should be easily fixed by the authors.
Major point
- electrode placement verification
12
1) The location of the recordings is not well described (“…at the ventral aspect of the vertical
lobe…”; was the electrode placed inside the vertical lobe, or near it? I’m not sure what is meant
by ‘ventral aspect’. Please provide a better description.
2) Along the same lines: With extracellular recordings it is obviously impossible to verify the
identity of the recorded neurons. However, it is essential to verify the correct placement of the
electrode by examining the brains after the experiment. This is especially important as the lateral
accessory lobe is located very close to the ventral part of the VL; a region that contains many
visual and likely also olfactory neurons; if the electrode was misplaced by a few micrometers,
those regions could have been accidentally targeted.
I am sure the authors have done this verification step, so it should be possible to show the
insertion site of the electrode in the recorded brains. Please provide either histological images of
the recording sites that verify the location of the electrode, or provide at least a schematic
illustration that illustrates the electrode placements in each bee.
Minor points
Introduction
line 39: the references to visual input are arbitrary; moreover, the Seelig and Jayaraman paper
makes an explicit point about the multimodal nature of the head-direction cells studied in the
paper (these cells work in the absence of visual information, thus they must integrate
proprioceptive cues with visual cues). Thus this paper is not a good example supporting the
statement of the authors. Reference 1 seems a rather random example of a paper that studies
visual neurons in mice. A review that summarizes processing underlying visually driven
behaviors would be more suited.
line 41: “..neuronal networks are not only confronted with single modalities…” Not true in all
cases; there are circuits that deal with only one modality (sensory systems…). Please me more
specific as to which circuits you refer to.
line 52-53: The sentence starting with “We therefore…” was confusing to me, as it is not clear at
this point why the MB-output neurons are the first site of integration. This becomes clear later on,
so this sentence should be moved after the explanation that the sensory inputs remain segregated
in the Calyx and the Kenyon cells.
It should be mentioned somewhere whether the experiments were done on naive or experienced
bees, or whether the state of the bees was not controlled in any way. This is crucial for the
interpretation of the results, especially when neurons are recorded that might encode learned
valences of stimuli. This sets the expectations of the reader and provides essential context for
interpretation of the data.
Methods:
line 94: what is the unit of the concentration? g/l, mol/l, or is it just a 100x dilution?
line 111: synchronize not synchronized
line 125: see major comment on description of recording site
13
line 151: what is the alpha function and the resolution tau? Please provide a bit more detail.
line 151: why were the recordings baseline corrected? Was the background activity so variable
across trials? If so, that might indicate either damaged cells, a large population of different cells
pooled in the dataset, or different states of the circuit in different bees. This should be discussed.
section after 154: The description of how the population vectors were computed is not clear to
me. Please explain in a way that is more accessible to a broader audience. What is an ’n-
dimensional rate vector’?
general: How was the quality of the recordings assessed? What were criteria for
inclusion/exclusion of data (aside from the spike sorting criteria). If recordings with drifting
baselines were included, this might mask neural responses during some stages of the recording.
Please add the used criteria to the methods.
Why were the used colors and odors chosen? Is there anything particularly relevant about those
odors? Are the flower related? Innate preferences?
Results/Discussion
general: It does not come across very clearly which information was fed into the PCA, so that it is
not very intuitive to interpret some of the results. After a few reads I think I understood that only
the baseline-corrected peak firing was used. I doubt that the temporal structure of the responses
was disregarded, but cannot really find this information. Either way, this should be stated more
explicitly in the results/figures and in the methods.
line 255: ‘specific’ There is no indication in the data that these cells encode specific combinations.
On the contrary, they seem to encode all combinations of olfactory and visual cues (at least across
the presented stimuli). Please reword.
line 280: “Since MBONs in naive…” this sentence should be part of the introduction, as it sets the
expectations and hypothesis for the paper.
lines 284 following: I am a little unsure what a category ‘light’ would actually mean. You tested
color, but the neurons don’t seem to care about color. But the mere presence of light is not a
meaningful stimulus for the bee (other than signaling that it is outside the hive). What would
happen if you showed behaviorally relevant objects to the MBONs? Also, bees are known to have
an innate preference to the color blue. However, there is no indication that this is reflected in the
neuron’s activity. Overall, the term categorization in combination with valence coding implies
that behaviorally relevant categories are formed, but there is no indication of that in the data.
Please discuss the relevance of the encoded information more deeply.
lines 311 and following: The anatomical divisions of the vertical lobe don’t appear to be
concentric, at least according to one of the most details studies of the honeybee vertical lobe
projections (Strausfeld NJ. Organization of the honey bee mushroom body: representation of the
calyx within the vertical and gamma lobes. The Journal of Comparative Neurology 2002;450:4–33.
doi:10.1002/cne.10285.). Rather they seem to contain horizontal layers that represent the portions
of the calyx. The visual regions would be most dorsally represented, while the ventral regions are
olfactory (the most ventral rim represents the gamma lobe though). So, it is a bit unexpected that,
given the ventral placement of the electrode) that only so few cells responded to the olfactory
stimuli only. This is another reason for requiring more detailed information on the placement of
the electrodes.
14
line 325: where would this ‘early’ combination of olfaction with vision be achieved? The calyx
would be the only realistic possibility; but then, are the authors suggesting that the neurons of the
lip integrate vision as well?
So either there is a bias in the recordings that for some reason leads to an underrepresentation of
purely olfactory MBONs, or some MBONs would need to pick up information form more than
one VL-layer. Are such neurons known? Is there anything known about how many cells
innervate the different layers of the VL (vertical lobe)?
There is only a very limited discussion of what is known from Drosophila. The valence coding of
MB-output cells was thoroughly described in that species and a more detailed comparison seems
essential to give relevance to the bee-results presented here.
Open data section
It seems an unnecessary barrier for open access to require contacting the University IT
department for access to the files. It would be highly desirable to deposit the data (additionally)
in a truly open access repository (such as figshare.com). In either case, please provide information
about how the datasets will be annotated, what are the identifiers used to pinpoint the relevant
files? As it is, there is no realistic way in accessing the files for actual reuse.

mean might overstate the precision of the cells (especially given the raw data in panel A, which

suggestion for E: It would be nice to project the model onto a anatomically more realistic

Introduction
l. 55 … “approximately 400 MBON neurons” As pointed out by previous reviewer #1, the actual
number is not known. The reference [15] only mentions 400 extrinsic neurons, but does not
specify output neurons.
While I have not been involved in the first review cycle of this paper, I must say that the major
point repeatedly raised by reviewer #1, the identity of MB output neurons, has not been properly
addressed by the authors. Basically, in their rebuttal the authors repeatedly state that reviewer #1
is correct and that they plan to do intracellular recording and staining in the future. That is fine,
but it does resolve the misleading terminology in the current paper. The neurons are extrinsic Mb
neurons, and they should be referred to as such. There is no way the authors can determine if the
neurons provide output from, input to, or feedback to the MB. The authors should just omit the
term MBON throughout the text and in the Discussion explain their reasoning why they think
these neurons are output neurons.
Methods
l. 126 “…In that area MBON neurites are about ~10 µm [15] thick” This is not correct. The cited
study shows 2-3 large neurons with thick axons (less than 10 µm, though) in this area. Based on
the drawings and micrographs in that study, the axons of hundreds of other extrinsic neurons in
the recording area are much thinner.
Results
l. 228 “… increases in the response rates to stimulation with the olfactory-visual compounds do
not represent a simple summation, they suggest a more complex type of non-linear additive
computation“ This seems trivial. Neurons almost never show ‘simple summation’. The same
16
goes for l. 257 – 261 in the
Discussion.
l. 244-245 “ Altogether this suggests that the MBON level represents distinct categorizations
between modalities (olfaction and vison) as well as their compound stimuli.” Unfortunately,
important controls seem to be missing: How do the neurons respond to the combination of two
colors or two odors? How much do those responses differ from the light/odor combinations?
How do they differ from responses to high/low odorant concentrations or dim/bright light?
What is the evidence that the multimodal neurons discriminate modalities at all?
Discussion
l. 291 – 293 “We found a separation in three broad categories of stimuli (odour, light and
odour+light) at the level of MBONs..” See above. In the absence of different odor or light
intensity stimuli, there is no evidence that the bimodal neurons discriminate modalities. The
authors only show that more stimulus results in stronger response.
l. 312 – 314 “we potentially recorded from MBONs associated with the A1, A2, A4, A5 and A7
extrinsic neuron clusters. … Therefore, each of the four response categories might be related to
one of the five cell clusters.” While the authors themselves call this speculative, this seems utterly
fanciful, given that there is no evidence for this notion whatsoever. The “support” for this notion
(l. 324-326) is also misleading: There is no evidence suggesting that Kenyon cells in the basal ring
are indeed, as the authors imply, bimodal.

This paper successfully demonstrates three categories of responses; olfactory, visual and
olfactory-visual (multimodal) type, in the ventral lobe of the mushroom body (MB), determined
by extracellular recording. Based on the results, the authors discuss about functions of the
17
mushroom body; integration of two sensory modalities and rapid categorization of information.
The methods are appropriate for the purpose and the data are clear. The authors respond to
reviewers’ comments well in especially about careful interpretation of the data including
limitation of the method “extracellular recording” and add some supplemental materials.
I think that this work shows interesting data as a first step of study about multimodal processing
to represent a real world in the brain. In addition, comparative aspect of this study is quite
important to understand the function of the MB among insect species. Thus this paper could
attract a broad range of readers.
Here I have some minor comments.
I still concern about electrode placement verification, which the previous reviewer mentioned.
Did you confirm the position of the electrode in each animal after recording histologically? That
is really important point of this study. If not, how did you confirm that the electrode was NOT in
the lateral accessory lobe or the central complex? Please describe a bit more about the point.
L 46: not ommaditiae but ommatidia (probably)
Line 55~: MBONs integrate not only activity Kenyon Cells (KC) but also the processing of
MBONs could be modulated by aminergic neurons. I understand that you simplify the stream of
processing in the MB but because of introduction it is good to involve what kinds of information
MBONs would receive.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Richard Benton):
I think the issue of terminology still needs to be addressed. Two reviewers (#1 and #3) raised
problem with calling the neurons MBONs, and the authors also admit it might be misleading.
24
Rather than using the vague MB extrinsic neuron term, I suggest the authors write in the
title/abstract: "**putative/potential** mushroom body (MB) output neurons" to convey that lack
of certainty from the beginning of the paper. They could also useful put some of the discussion of
terminology that comes in their first response letter paragraph ("We do understand the point
raised ...") directly into the text at the paragraph starting line 55 so this issue (which is a larger
issue in the field, and not just this ms) is fully exposed.

Appendix A
Manuscript ID RSOS-171343 entitled "Multimodal Integration and Stimulus Categorization in
Mushroom Body Output Neurons of the Honeybee"
Associate Editor Comments to Author:
This is a tricky case, with polarised views of the two reviewers. I read the article and it seems that it is
a well-performed study within the (substantial) technical constraints of the honeybee nervous
ystem for relating function to anatomy. I think Reviewer 1 holds the ms to an impossibly high
tandard for this journal, and propose that the authors should be allowed to chance to revise their
manuscript where reasonably possible and otherwise highlight more carefully the caveats of the
nterpretations of their electrophysiological recordings.
Subject Editor Comments to Author:
As mentioned by the AE, this is a difficult one as the reviewers are polarised. Both reviewers
ecommend a number of changes, which means it is impossible to accept the manuscript in its
present form. The first reviewer, despite listing a number of major issues, is positive on some
aspects, while the second reviewer only requires minor changes. Therefore on balance I am happy to
go with the AE recommendation of allowing resubmission, addressing as many comments raised by
he reviewers as possible.
We are grateful to both Editors for carefully reading our manuscript and understanding the goal of
his study, and we appreciate their fair decision allowing resubmission. We thank the reviewers,
especially Stanley Heinze, for his open and constructive review, which helped us to work through our
manuscript like rewording unclear paragraphs, adding supplementary data, strengthening some of
our statements, and reorganising the discussion.
n general, we can follow and understand the scientific scepticism of the first reviewer who is mainly
driven by the motivation to get the WHOLE picture of circuits underlying multi-modal integration in
he brain at once by combined in detail physiological and morphological analyses at the level of
ndividual neurons. However, as reviewer 1 pointed out, there are many steps towards this goal
ncluding many intracellular recordings and staining of many individual neurons,
mmunohistochemistry detection of transmitters etc. We see our study as the beginning of such a
cientific venture, but, given the previous work on multi-unit recordings (Strube et al. 2011, 2012,
2016) of neurons at the MB output, we feel it is important and worthwhile to publish the new
indings that may as well inspire research on other insects including Drosophila. We are well aware
hat the genetic tools in Drosophila make it relatively easy to target individual sets of neurons
ncluding MBONs, for example for calcium imaging analyses. However, the electrophysiological
analysis of spike activity of these neurons over a long period, allowing for example classical
onditioning experiments in same individuals, and the comparison of neuronal responses in a highly
uitable model insect like the honeybee before, during, and after learning, are unique. This, so far, is
problematic in Drosophila as genetically encoded calcium sensors are subject to bleaching and have
poor temporal resolution. Furthermore, recordings with sharp electrodes allow only access in the
ange of minutes. The latter is also true in the honeybee, which was the main motivation to push
orward the multi-unit recording technique and using an ecologically relevant model – multimodal
ensory integration in a pollinating insect. Long-term observation of MBON spiking activity in
Drosophila would require similar long-term recordings. In summary, using a pollinating insect like the
honeybee with its well characterized learning abilities for floral odours AND colours, from our point
of view, represents a clear advantage for the present and future (planned) work. We are aware of the
echnical constraints of our model system and, therefore, extended the methods section as well
analytical steps with necessary details.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Mushroom bodies, which are paired centers in insect forebrains, are famous because of their
uggested role in learning and memory. The most compelling evidence for this comes from studies of
Drosophila where targeted gene expression as well as other methods for single cell identification
demonstrates morphological identifies of neurons, to which functions pertaining to learning and
memory can be confidently ascribed. The notion that mushroom bodies are required for cognitive
unctions derives not from work on fruitflies but from Dujardin’s claim in 1850 that these centers
underlie cognition. Not surprising, then, that the honey bee has been the “other” taxon, on which
numerous studies on learning and memory have been undertaken. However, the strategies used for
analyzing the honey bee mushroom bodies reflect the limitations offered by social insects in applying
methods, including targeted gene expression, to reveal functional circuits described in terms of real
neurons. Apart from some neuroanatomical studies, we are still very much in the dark about what
neurons do what in establishing learning in a honey bee’s brain.
We agree with the reviewer - there is no perfect model organism. For example, although the genetic
toolbox” in Drosophila allows targeted gene expression as well as other methods for single cell
dentification there are still experimental restrictions, especially when it comes to real time
electrophysiological monitoring of neuronal activity over long periods (see arguments above).
Furthermore, the expression of genetically encoded sensors may result in un-physiological neuronal
properties by overexpression of ‘foreign’ proteins. To reveal the functional circuits of a network the
network needs to be intact which might not always be the case when genetically manipulated.
Another problem of imaging cell activity besides bleaching (see comment above) is temperature
dependency. We realized this in a recent project when we expressed shibire in local interneurons of
he Drosophila antennal lobe and measured GCamp (which we expressed in either OSNs or PNs)
before during and after the temperature switch (Strube-Bloss et al. 2017). We noticed that GCamp
and most likely other genetically encoded sensors) are extremely temperature sensitive, which can
be rather problematic when measuring brain network activity. Even the observation of neuronal
networks expressing GECIs in Drosophila using two-photon imaging, which is relatively heat intense,
might be restricted to some experimental limitations, which we are aware of. Taking together there
re pros and cons for both methods and model systems. From our point of view the established long-
erm access at different neuronal levels using extracellular multi-unit recordings in combination with
he possibility to classical conditioning of bees WHILE recording is a clear advantage to use the
honeybee in a well-known and ecologically relevant context. We are aware of the technical
imitations, especially when it comes to identifying (functionally AND structurally) individual neurons,
but we are working towards this goal as the reviewer correctly pointed out. However, for the reasons
mentioned above, we think that our present study is an important first step in initiating a long-term
cientific venture. We extended the methods section and added details to the analytical steps to
better explain the method and its limitations. Furthermore, we toned down the discussion when it
omes to morphological identification of neurons.
n this manuscript the authors rely on a number of publications in trusting that extracellular
electrodes and spike sorting can provide data to demonstrate multimodal convergence and stimulus
ategorization – prerequisites for associative learning – in mushroom body output neurons that are
here referred to as MBONs, using nomenclature that Drosophila researchers use for naming
morphologically and functionally identified mushroom body output neurons.
The problem that the present manuscript presents is the contrast of identifying the functional role
of a morphologically recognized MBON (as in Drosophila) versus assuming that a recording alone can
dentify a MBON, for which there is no morphological correlate. This aspect of the present paper
presents the insoluble challenges (1) of accepting as a given that the described units are MBONs
ather than other neurons, such as those supplying mushroom body; and (2) that the electrodes are
ndeed where they are intended to be.
Several authors (including Strube-Bloss in earlier publications) used the term mushroom body
extrinsic neuron (EN) when recording neurons at this processing level. We recently decided to use
he term MBON, for two reasons: First, at this neuronal level within the MB (vertical) lobe, activity is
nfluenced by upstream Kenyon Cell activity and then projected to other neuropils outside the MBs,
despite the fact that many recurrent circuits provide feedback within MB compartments. Therefore,
he term reflects a most important feature of neurons at this level. Second, we decided to use the
ame terminology as, for example, Drosophila researchers to make clear at which processing level we
work and aiming at discussions across neuroscientists working on that processing level in different
nsect species.
Regarding the second part of the reviewer comment: Although we were not able to morphologically
dentify individual MBONs, we are able to record their activity over long time periods allowing large
ets of stimuli (and monitoring of activity), and, in the future, the performance of learning and
memory tests in the same animal. The methods sections make very clear that we record
extracellularly at this processing level and that we obtain single unit activity by using spike-sorting
algorithms. In conclusion, we think that using the term MBON increases readability and
omparability of our results. We extensively cited our earlier publications in which we illustrated in
much detail the recording (electrode) position at the MB vertical lobe and compared the recorded
extracellular signals to, for example, typical KC activity. However, to increase transparency and, at
he same time, maintain readability we now included an illustration of the brain preparation and the
ecording position as supplemental material.
My review, such as it is, first considers (line by line) some of the premises, on which the authors base
heir experiments.
The second is a general comment on the experimental results and their validity.
The third briefly refers to their discussion.
The Introduction.
ine 32. What is intramodal? Variations of one modality?
YES – variation of stimulus quality within a modality! We added an explanation in the text.
ine 32. “largely completed at the level of MB input, and information at the MB output…” What and
where is the input? Evolutionarily, the input is to the lobes, not the calyx. So it is unclear whether the
authors think that the calyx is the exclusive input region. What about the evidence for substantial
nputs to the lobes as well as to the calyx?
n the abstract, we keep this brief to draw a quick picture. This is explained in more detail in the
ntroduction (line 56ff).
ine 40. “While these studies revealed insight into processing of unimodal information in the brain, in
eality neuronal networks are not only confronted with single modalities at a time. “ This is a puzzling
tatement. Almost all learning and memory experiments involve two distinct stimuli, often employing
wo distinct modalities.
Sure, the reward pathway can be driven by another modality (taste, chemo tactile, heat, pain…). In
he introduction this aspect becomes clear, and the first two citations concentrate predominantly on
visual processing, while reference 3-4 concentrates on olfactory processing.
ine 42. “……the neuronal machinery, for….” Please, it is not machinery!
At least this is a common metaphor when investigating brain function, although we agree that its
philosophical meaning certainly is a matter of discussion. For example: Eccles J.C. (1970) The
Neuronal Machinery of the Brain. In: Facing Reality. Heidelberg Science Library. Springer, New York,
NY.
ine 43. “..has to simultaneously analyse stimulus qualities…” Must it? This seems simplistic. What
about sequential operations, as when associations draw on memorized data to assess valence?
ncidentally, only one paper thus far has demonstrated that valence is encoded by mushroom body
output neurons: reference 44 (Hige et al).
…sequential operations…” really? We are aware that the nervous system operates by using
equential and parallel processing. Only sequential processing seems simplistic. What about
emporal synchronization between neuropils during memory processing, parallel processing, and
emporal codes in general?
ine 53. “..established and reliable extracellular multiunit recording technique [8–13].” But is it? The
pike sorting algorithms are reliable, but at this point, the ringing of alarm bells concern the identities
of neurons, which as far as I am able to determine [in 8-13], have never been adequately
demonstrated. And that is a huge concern when what is required for understanding what’s going on
n the mushroom body circuit is to ascribe responses to neuroanatomically identifiable MBONs.
Our intention here, and in earlier studies, is not to give individual isolated units a morphological
dentity or address. We are aware that this is not possible using extracellular recordings. Since we
use population response analyses, the identity would be gone anyway. However, in the future we
plan intracellular recordings to identify individual MBONs to embed them into this context.
Moreover, these experiments will not allow testing response modulation during and after learning,
or population response analyses as the time window of a stable intracellular recording in the
honeybee (and most other insects) allows only recordings in the minutes range. A clever combination
of intra and extracellular methods combined with neuroanatomical analyses and learning and
memory studies is our goal for future analyses of multimodal processing in the honeybee. But, this
will take many more years to get the entire circuits worked out!
ine 55. “The group of MBONs, in the honeybee approximately 400 neurons [14], integrate
activity…..” The authors base this study on the premise that there are 400 output neurons from the
vertical lobes. There are many reasons to be worried about this estimate. In the cited paper, clusters
of cobalt-labeled cell bodies are indicated, but apart from diagrammatic connections to the lobes,
neuroanatomical evidence for these populations relating to MBONs is, at the very best, sparse. This
means that '400' cannot be secure and might be a vast overestimate. Furthermore, the cited paper
makes no distinction between output and input neurons. The assumption seems to be that every
arborization in the alpha lobe is that of an output neuron. But we know from studies of Drosophila
and honey bees) and cockroaches that the lobes are densely populated by domains of afferent
erminals. And we know from comparative studies that the lobes receive a major, in some species
he exclusive, afferent supply.
We agree with the reviewer that the number in the honeybee is an estimate, and that there are
MBONs in Drosophila and the honeybee that should be named (output-input-neurons). However, our
ntention was not to introduce a new nomenclature. We rather wanted to provide the reader a rough
estimate about the dimensions in neuronal numbers and the resulting divergence (KCs) and
onvergence (MBONs) in the network by citing the related literature.
ine 64. “….or MB ß neurons [20] (both can be seen as special clusters of MBONs),” This study [20] is
also based on extracellular recordings of neurons asserted as belonging to the beta lobe but without
any anatomical support.
ine 65. “……cross-modal integration in the honeybee has never been tested rigorously at the
neurophysiological level.” I agree. This is an urgent need. But it requires both anatomical and
physiological identification of the neuron(s).
We agree with the reviewer, but decide to start this endeavour with the physiology part of the
project using population level analyses by employing long-term extracellular recordings. This
approach will allow us in the future to investigate olfactory-visual modulations following learning and
memory formation. As stated above morphological identification of individual neurons is on our
chedule for future work.
ine 126. “that area MBON neurites are about ~10 µm thick ….” How do you know?
Cell bodies of some MBON clusters are around 30µm in diameter, and the axo-dendrites about 10µm
n diameter. We know this from different morphological studies (for example: Rybak and Menzel
1993, Brandt et al. 2005, Kirschner et al. 2006), and reconstructions shown in the honeybee standard
3D brain atlas available at the home page of the free university. We now included relevant citations
and referred to the supplemental material, which we added to our manuscript.
The Results.
There are no issues with respect to the stimulus set-up, which other than gluing the antennae (see
below) is straightforward. Nor can one challenge the use of spike sorting and statistical analysis.
These are established techniques, with which the first author has considerable experience. However,
he results raise many questions. For example, can the percentages given (lines 180-187) show how
many neurons were available for any particular recording? Can one assume that each spike
epresents a neuron? After all, insect neurons have extraordinarily elaborate shapes, and the
mushroom body’s neurons are no exception, one nerve cell possibly – indeed probably – supporting
more than one spiking unit. How can the strategy of extracellular recording from numerous active
elements – I hesitate to write neurons – provide reliable data about whether those elements are
efferents or afferents? The assertion that “In that area MBON neurites are about ~10 µm thick and
nduce well pronounced spike shapes in the differential recording channels which are distinct from
other neurons in that area” (lines 126, 127), has no supporting data nor any supporting reference, so
t doesn’t inspire confidence. In any event, what is being referred to here as a neurite: an axon,
dendrite, cell body fiber?
NO – the percentages do not reflect how many neurons were available for any particular recording.
They rather provide an estimate of the percentage of different response types in recorded MBON-
units that were recorded in this particular region at the ventral aspect of the vertical lobe (see
upplemental material). This is now stated more clearly in the text. Other MBON, like the GABAergic
PCT neurons were not recorded, as they branch in very different region area of the vertical lobe. In
otal, we extracted 92 single units recorded in 22 honeybees, which, on average, is 4 units per bee.
Each spike shape represents the action potential waveform of a single unit - this is the idea of spike
orting. However, if the reviewer’s question is whether we can use the waveforms of a unit to
dentify the same unit (neuron) in different animals, we have to say NO! That is only possible if the
neuron has a very characteristic spike pattern like the PE1 (Okada et al. 2007).
We totally agree with the reviewer that we record from neurites (certainly not cell bodies) of
MBONs. Depending on the location(s) of the action potential initiation zone(s) of these neurons there
might be different functions. The PE1 for example has two big branches. When recording
extracellularly Okada R. (2007) used the characteristic spiking pattern of the PE1 (from previous
ntracellular recordings), which is double and triple spikes, resulting in a typical bimodal
nstantaneous firing rate distribution. The double spikes may have their origin at the integrating
egment, which integrates the activity of two single branches. Recording the PE1 at the single
branch, before the integrating segment, may result in a unimodal instantaneous firing rate
distribution. We are aware of these facts, which is one of the reasons why we used the neutral term
neurite and describe why we can record well-pronounced action potential waveforms from these
neurites. In line 129 we cite our earlier publications “(for further details [9–11]”. And in the related
upplementary materials we show that KC-neurite waveforms (much smaller) can be clearly
discriminated from MBON-neurite waveforms (larger) because of their large difference in axo-
dendritic diameters.
or the present manuscript, we decided to add a supplemental material section to provide this
nformation for interested readers.
ince we cannot say that we record from an axonal or dendritic branch (cell bodies are far off from
our recording position), we used the term neurite to avoid the impression that we can distinguish the
wo. We think this is a fair and straightforward nomenclature.
Another experimental concern pertains to the known functions of MBONs. In Drosophila, certain
lasses of MBON’s signal the valence of a stimulus or stimulus combinations, and it is assumed that
uch an assessment of the “value” of a stimulus combination (which valence implies) requires many
enses. Yet by affixing the antennae, the honey bee is denied a crucial exploratory behavior by these
highly mobile appendages. It’s akin to not being able to turn one’s head towards a interesting
onversation in a crowded room, to use the authors’ analogy in their discussion. And can one simply
assume that multi-electrode recordings suggesting ensemble activity reflect the activity of a specific
ensemble of MBONs? Wouldn’t one have to assume that such an ensemble should consist of
numerous neurons situated in the same activity domain, meaning a volume of the lobe, the axons or
dendrites of which are tightly clustered (could they otherwise be identified as an ensemble)? That
many neurons can be recorded simultaneously would be informative if that information is put into a
ontext that addresses circuit organization (not conjectural, but anatomical, which is the only one
hat counts). And there is this consideration: the dendrites of an efferent neuron converge onto its
axon very close to, or even just outside the boundary of the lobe. That being the case, what is
generating spikes in the lobe? The largest dendrites? If that is a possibility, then wouldn’t
ynchronous – aka ensemble – activity be an expected attribute within a dendritic tree of a single
nerve cell? Bear in mind that there is no reliable data pertaining to the location or even number of
pike initiating zones of an insect neuron.
Fixing the antenna is necessary to protect the electrode and reduce muscle artefacts. Sure, due to
experimental procedures in the lab, the animal needs to be fixed and is unable to move towards the
timulus, which is not necessary, since we illuminate the entire compound eyes and placed both
antennae into the odour airstream. The animal has no need to turn its head. However, we here
describe an ensemble consisting of different neurons - some keep the single modality information,
others are multimodal and receive combined olfactory-visual information. The cell bodies of the
espective neurons are fare away from the area in which we record their neurites, but the latter are
at least in close vicinity at the ventral aspect of the MB vertical lobe.
n the end, we are happy to inspire the reviewer and other researchers to address this kind of
physiological phenomenon we describe by sophisticated morphological studies of that area. At the
ame time, we hope that our results provide good arguments for funding a combined morphological
physiological approach in our future projects.
This kind of electrophysiological analysis begs for support from evidence confirming where the
electrodes are situated. Only in one previous publication by the first author has there been an
attempt to show this, and then that was a large patch of fluorescent dye. Would there be an
nvestment in developing a method that would reveal the structural context (in the form of axons,
branches, cytoarchitectonics) of such multiple recordings then results such as these would assume
onviction. But even then, the experimenter still would be required to determine if she/he is
ecording from afferent or efferent neurons. The elephant in the room is the number of inputs that
nvade the lobes. To assume that extrinsic neurons are always outputs would be a grievous error. The
analysis demands an algorithm that can distinguishes spikes generated by a MBON from those
arried by a MBIN. But this probably wishful thinking.
We agree, that indeed is a dilemma but as science is constantly evolving, we are working hard to find
better solutions (and necessary funding for it) in the future!
The Discussion.
The discussion illustrates, like no other part of this paper, that the authors can only surmise the
ocation of the recorded neurons. The absence of any definitive clue as to what these are, how many
here might be, and where they are located (it’s important because their location would inform
where their axons project) is extremely worrying. Published data show that in those slabs of the
obes that represent the lip, collar and basal ring, arborizations of both input and output neurons are
highly variable, some interacting with two slabs, others all three, rarely with just one. Only neurons
of the gamma lobe appear restricted just to it. These aspects illustrate that knowing what neurons
he recordings sample is paramount. The Discussion here demonstrates that, so far, this isn’t known
and that any interpretation relies on conjecture. On the brighter side, if there is any laboratory with
he expertise for developing a reliable method to resolve this dilemma, the Rössler lab would be the
one to do it.
Thanks for pointing this out and for being as optimistic as we are! We think that this is what a serious
discussion should be about! Besides all the excitement about our results – we think we here provide
new and interesting insight especially when it comes to modelling MB-function and the modulation
of single versus multimodal stimuli – we decided to discuss our results very carefully and without
unnecessary speculation.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript by Strube-Bloss and Rößler entitled “Multimodal integration and stimulus
ategorization in mushroom body output neurons of the honeybee” is an interesting paper that
extracellular electrophysiology to characterize responses of units in the mushroom body vertical
obes to visual and olfactory cues. The paper is clearly written and well illustrated. The methods are
olid and the conclusions are in line with the results. I have one major point and a few minor issues
hat would need to be addressed, but all of these should be easily fixed by the authors.
Major point
electrode placement verification
1) The location of the recordings is not well described (“…at the ventral aspect of the vertical lobe…”;
was the electrode placed inside the vertical lobe, or near it? I’m not sure what is meant by ‘ventral
aspect’. Please provide a better description.
AR 1) In the initial manuscript we cited and referred to earlier publications and supplements therein
n which we described the electrode position close to the MB vertical lobe in reasonable detail.
However, to avoid too much distraction and confusion in the main text and, at the same to increase
ransparency of the methods for interested readers, we now include the details of brain preparation
and electrode insertion as additional supplemental material.
2) Along the same lines: With extracellular recordings it is obviously impossible to verify the identity
of the recorded neurons. However, it is essential to verify the correct placement of the electrode by
examining the brains after the experiment. This is especially important as the lateral accessory lobe is
ocated very close to the ventral part of the VL; a region that contains many visual and likely also
olfactory neurons; if the electrode was misplaced by a few micrometers, those regions could have
been accidentally targeted.
am sure the authors have done this verification step, so it should be possible to show the insertion
ite of the electrode in the recorded brains. Please provide either histological images of the recording
ites that verify the location of the electrode, or provide at least a schematic illustration that
llustrates the electrode placements in each bee.
n earlier publications, we verified the electrode placement in this very region using coagulation or
luorescent dye imaging (Strube-Bloss et al. 2011, 2011 and 2016) – see also our video on electrode
taining and dye injection in double electrode recordings in Brill et al. (2014). However, since we
were so far not able to push this method further to visualize more details beyond the electrode
placement at the ventral (6-7 o’clock position) vertical lobe position which, as we illustrate now in
more detail in the supplemental material, is relatively easy because the neuropils including the
vertical lobe can be clearly seen on the surface of the freshly dissected brain (in terms of having a
lear landmark this is much different from targeting, for example, the central complex). However, we
did not 3D reconstruct the electrode position in every animal. For the future, we plan more detailed
ntracellular staining of MBON clusters to be able to relate the electrode position better to particular
MBON types. For the moment, and we hope that we convinced the reviewer, the only statement we
an make is, that we recorded neurites of MBONs of different clusters representing a subset of the
otal number of MBONs (see also our comments on points raised by reviewer 1).
Minor points
ntroduction
ine 39: the references to visual input are arbitrary; moreover, the Seelig and Jayaraman paper makes
an explicit point about the multimodal nature of the head-direction cells studied in the paper (these
ells work in the absence of visual information, thus they must integrate proprioceptive cues with
visual cues). Thus this paper is not a good example supporting the statement of the authors.
Reference 1 seems a rather random example of a paper that studies visual neurons in mice. A review
hat summarizes processing underlying visually driven behaviors would be more suited.
We cited this article because Seelig and Jayaraman used visual cues only (presence or absence of
timuli - no other modality was tested) and related it to behaviour. However, as the reviewer pointed
out, to produce a behavioural output also proprioceptive cues were integrated which is also
discussed in the cited paper, but multimodality is not pinpointed. Another interpretation of the
authors was a visually induced memory trace. However, we added a review by Almut Kelber as
uggested by the reviewer.
ine 41: “..neuronal networks are not only confronted with single modalities…” Not true in all cases;
here are circuits that deal with only one modality (sensory systems…). Please me more specific as to
which circuits you refer to.
That sensory systems deal only with one modality is probably also not true in all cases (compare
omment above). For example, the AL of bees (although it is called the olfactory centre) is innervated
by the Vummx1 neuron facilitating the reward. In addition, thermosensory neurons are relayed to
he AL. Furthermore, other centrifugal neurons like ALF or AL1 in honeybees connect the mushroom
body with the AL (see Rybak 1993 and Kirschner 2006), and multimodal output of the mushroom
body potentially could influence unimodal processing in the periphery. Thus, besides the pure
ensory neuron activity, there might be no strictly unimodal network! We used this statement on
purpose, since we think one has to see the brain in its entity!
ine 52-53: The sentence starting with “We therefore…” was confusing to me, as it is not clear at this
point why the MB-output neurons are the first site of integration. This becomes clear later on, so this
entence should be moved after the explanation that the sensory inputs remain segregated in the
Calyx and the Kenyon cells.
We rewrote the sentence as suggested by the reviewer.
t should be mentioned somewhere whether the experiments were done on naive or experienced
bees, or whether the state of the bees was not controlled in any way. This is crucial for the
nterpretation of the results, especially when neurons are recorded that might encode learned
valences of stimuli. This sets the expectations of the reader and provides essential context for
nterpretation of the data.
We started the method section with: “Honeybee foragers (Apis mellifera carnica) from our
departmental bee station at the University of Würzburg were captured and anesthetized on ice…”
Since in nature the bees had neither been confronted with a single wavelength nor with a single
odour component they were naïve for the stimuli tested! However, in general we now avoid the
erm ‘naïve’ and replaced it by ‘unconditioned’ to not mislead the reader.
Methods:
ine 94: what is the unit of the concentration? g/l, mol/l, or is it just a 100x dilution?
We added (volume/volume) to the concentration.
ine 111: synchronize not synchronized
Thanks! We changed it.
ine 125: see major comment on description of recording site
We now refer to the supplemental material we added.
ine 151: what is the alpha function and the resolution tau? Please provide a bit more detail.
As suggested by the reviewer we added more details in the method section.
To answer the question, these are parameters to calculate the time resolved instantaneous mean
iring rate (ISI) out of the single trial spike trains using the FIND open source toolbox we refer to. The
alpha function defines the shape of the kernel that is used to estimate the ISI (it could also be
Gaussian or Exponential depending on the data). The kernel in that case can be seen as a sliding
window (with alpha shape in our case, since we have phasic tonic responses) which has a special
width (tau) which determines the time resolution of the kernel (sliding window). We applied an
automatic method to determine the optimal kernel width (tau) as described in Nawrot et al. (1999).
For kernel estimation of the firing rate we are using the algorithm published in the FIND toolbox.
ine 151: why were the recordings baseline corrected? Was the background activity so variable
across trials? If so, that might indicate either damaged cells, a large population of different
ells pooled in the dataset, or different states of the circuit in different bees. This should be
discussed.
The baseline activity across trials was stable as illustrated by the spike raster plots (Fig 2A). However,
neurons at this processing level show individual and relatively high baseline activities which is
onsistent with intracellular recordings. We included an additional sentence and a reference into the
method section saying: “Since the spontaneous baseline activity of the recorded units varied
between 5-40 Hz which is consistent with intracellular recordings at this processing level [29] we
applied a baseline correction for better visualization of the data.” as a short comment on that. During
earning experiments (odour-reward associations) we found shifts in baseline activity accompanied
by recruitment of responses in MBONs during memory tests (three hours after conditioning) which
we interpreted as consolidation effects (see our earlier publications: Strube-Bloss et al. 2011 and
2016).
n the present manuscript we did not train the animals and did not observe changes in baseline
activity.
ection after 154: The description of how the population vectors were computed is not clear to me.
Please explain in a way that is more accessible to a broader audience. What is an ’n-dimensional rate
vector’?
n the method section we wrote: “…and an ensemble of n neurons we constructed the n-dimensional
ate vector”. Thus, it is the rate of each unit aligned on top of each other like the heat maps in Fig. 3.
We added this note at the end of the sentence.
general: How was the quality of the recordings assessed? What were criteria for inclusion/exclusion
of data (aside from the spike sorting criteria). If recordings with drifting baselines were included, this
might mask neural responses during some stages of the recording. Please add the used criteria to the
methods.
The electrodes were permanently anchored using two component silicone (see methods). This
usually avoids electrode drift. However, our spike sorting criteria excluded the possibility of
misclassification by electrode drift because of the following reason: If the electrode would slightly
move, the amplitude and spike shapes would gradually change this would result in smeared
hangeover between two clusters. As a result, the clusters would not be separated, which was not
allowed to occur.
Why were the used colors and odors chosen? Is there anything particularly relevant about those
odors? Are the flower related? Innate preferences?
The LEDs emitted wavelengths close to the absorbance maxima of the blue and green receptors of
he honeybee. The same LEDs were used in Susan Fahrbach’s Lab to train bees to discriminate the
wo colours (see reference in the introduction). As far as we know there is no innate preference to
he odours. Furthermore, as we mention in the introduction: “The tested odorants were previously
hown to evoke distinct antennal lobe activity in Drosophila [24] and in bumblebees [25].” Thus, we
hink they would induce segregated AL activity in honeybees as well. We also started to conduct
behavioural experiments in our lab that show that both light as well as both odour stimuli can be
differentiated in classical differential conditioning experiments.
Results/Discussion
general: It does not come across very clearly which information was fed into the PCA, so that it is not
very intuitive to interpret some of the results. After a few reads I think I understood that only the
baseline-corrected peak firing was used. I doubt that the temporal structure of the responses was
disregarded, but cannot really find this information. Either way, this should be stated more explicitly
n the results/figures and in the methods.
n total, we applied three different PCAs on three subsets of our data. First: we used the whole
population vector as shown in figure 2A. This result is shown in Fig 2B. Second: we used only the
units responding to both modalities and repeated the analysis. The result is shown in Figure 2C. Note,
he Euclidean Distances were calculated separately between the population vectors and not in the
educed PCA space! Third: we used again only the units sensitive to both modalities and included
now also their responses (population vectors) to the compound stimulation. The results are shown in
Figure 4D. We always kept the temporal aspect and reduced the neuronal space. Thus, the temporal
tructure of the responses were kept alive (best visualized in Fig. 4D). We carefully worked over the
different sections to make this point clear.
ine 255: ‘specific’ There is no indication in the data that these cells encode specific combinations. On
he contrary, they seem to encode all combinations of olfactory and visual cues (at least across the
presented stimuli). Please reword.
Thanks for pointing that out! We used wrong wording and changed it now.
ine 280: “Since MBONs in naive…” this sentence should be part of the introduction, as it sets the
expectations and hypothesis for the paper.
The animals tested were not completely naïve, since we used foraging bees (compare comment
above). We changed the wording to “unconditioned”.
ines 284 following: I am a little unsure what a category ‘light’ would actually mean. You tested color,
but the neurons don’t seem to care about color. But the mere presence of light is not a meaningful
timulus for the bee (other than signaling that it is outside the hive). What would happen if you
howed behaviorally relevant objects to the MBONs? Also, bees are known to have an innate
preference to the color blue. However, there is no indication that this is reflected in the neuron’s
activity. Overall, the term categorization in combination with valence coding implies that behaviorally
elevant categories are formed, but there is no indication of that in the data. Please discuss the
elevance of the encoded information more deeply.
ines 311 and following: The anatomical divisions of the vertical lobe don’t appear to be concentric,
at least according to one of the most details studies of the honeybee vertical lobe projections
Strausfeld NJ. Organization of the honey bee mushroom body: representation of the calyx within the
vertical and gamma lobes. The Journal of Comparative Neurology 2002;450:4–33.
doi:10.1002/cne.10285.). Rather they seem to contain horizontal layers that represent the portions
of the calyx. The visual regions would be most dorsally represented, while the ventral regions are
olfactory (the most ventral rim represents the gamma lobe though). So, it is a bit unexpected that,
given the ventral placement of the electrode) that only so few cells responded to the olfactory
timuli only. This is another reason for requiring more detailed information on the placement of the
electrodes.
As stated above, in our opinion we need to think of the brain as a whole. Let’s stay with the category
odour. The coding centre for representation of individual odours as individual activity in a pattern of
glomeruli/projection neurons is the AL. In an earlier work we found a very fast representation in
MBONs at a time when the AL still computes for odours (Strube-Bloss et al. 2012). Thus, odour
oding by the sensory network in the AL is probably not finished, but the high-order brain centre
knows’ already that olfactory information is available. That is the category, it is fast and allows
riggering appropriate neural processing including activation of memory contents and comparing it
with coding of incoming information at the AL level. The same picture can be drawn for visual
nformation, where the MBs (in case they receive substantial visual input) rapidly ‘know’ that visual
nformation is available and can activate memory retrieval. Fast representation is also present at the
MBON level if both modalities occur together, but now this represents a different category, and the
MB output may trigger other appropriate pathways that are involved in evaluating the appropriate
behaviour. Innate preferences like the blue preference probably are not encoded at the MB level.
There are hints, and a recent study from the Sachse lab confirmed, that the Lateral Horn is involved
n innate stimulus processing. However, since the MB, from a common point of view, is rather
nvolved in memory formation the fast representation of categories might be rather important for
memory activation. We added this interpretation to the discussion.
We do not say the vertical lobe is organized in concentric layers, but the calyx is. And this concentric
ayered input is probably “reorganized” resulting in a layering of the vertical lobe (as described by
Strausfeld 2002). We do not record KCs in their specific layer (this data would not be sortable due to
he small signal amplitudes generated by very thin axons – see supplements and discussions of our
earlier publications). We inserted the electrode at the “bottle neck” where neurites of most MBON
lusters exit the MB vertical lobe. Intracellular staining of MBONs revealed large diameter axo-
dendritic branches, which might collect information across vertical lobe layers. We now included the
appropriate information in the supplemental material.
ine 325: where would this ‘early’ combination of olfaction with vision be achieved? The calyx would
be the only realistic possibility; but then, are the authors suggesting that the neurons of the lip
ntegrate vision as well?
This is probably a misunderstanding. We refer to the calyx in saying “at this still early processing
evel” since from the olfactory receptor neurons to the MB calyx there are only three synapses (four
up to the MBONs). This is indeed rather early to integrate another modality like vision in the present
ase (and compared to vertebrates).
So either there is a bias in the recordings that for some reason leads to an underrepresentation of
purely olfactory MBONs, or some MBONs would need to pick up information form more than one VL-
ayer. Are such neurons known? Is there anything known about how many cells innervate the
different layers of the VL (vertical lobe)?
This is indeed rather interesting and a reason, why we aim in the future to include morphological
taining of different MBON clusters and intracellular recordings of individual MBONs. Another
nterpretation might be, that vision, especially when it comes to learning and memory capacities in a
navigating insect, might require more neuronal capacities. But this is, so far, highly speculative.
There is only a very limited discussion of what is known from Drosophila. The valence coding of MB-
output cells was thoroughly described in that species and a more detailed comparison seems
essential to give relevance to the bee-results presented here.
As pointed out by reviewer1 only Hige in 2015 had shown in Drosophila that MBONs encode valence.
Much work was done on honeybee MBONs like the PE1 (Mauelshagen 1993, Okada et al. 2007) and
other MBONs (Strube-Bloss and others starting at 2011). We included all of these papers in the
discussion but aimed to keep it straight and focused.
Open data section
t seems an unnecessary barrier for open access to require contacting the University IT department
or access to the files. It would be highly desirable to deposit the data (additionally) in a truly open
access repository (such as figshare.com). In either case, please provide information about how the
datasets will be annotated, what are the identifiers used to pinpoint the relevant files? As it is, there
s no realistic way in accessing the files for actual reuse.
We understand the necessity and importance of good scientific praxis, and we certainly aim to
upport the public accessibility of our data. However, we think that ‘public’ available should not
nclude ‘freely’ available to everybody. First of all public money, also from the DFG, was spend to
generate the dataset. Therefore, these data are not personal property and should not be given away
uncontrolled to everybody. Furthermore, in this particular case, the data will still be used for future
analyses with collaboration partners in the neuroinformatics field to establish computational models
– therefore, the authors have an interest to control future use of the raw datasets. What we can do,
and that is probably the idea behind good scientific praxis, is to make it ‘public’ available. The
olution for that dilemma at the University of Würzburg is an archive server as given in the data
accessibility statement. However, if the journal prefers a data server outsourced from the University
of Würzburg, we suggest the data base of the German Neuroinformatics Node (www-g-node.de).

panel B: it would be desirable to see the variability of the average curves. Only presenting the mean
might overstate the precision of the cells (especially given the raw data in panel A, which seems
ather noisy)
Our intuition to show the raw spike trains was to provide the reader with “real” variability of the data
as suggested by the reviewer). The combination of trial resolved dot display (spike raster plot) and
PSTH (peri-stimulus time histogram), in our case the mean firing rate, is very common if trials were
epeated to be averaged. A mean rate of each single spike train would overload the figure.

uggestion for E: It would be nice to project the model onto a anatomically more realistic illustration;
.e. one that includes the layered structure of the VL as well as the spatial segregation of visual and
olfactory regions in the Calyx.
Thank you for the suggestion! We worked over the model as suggested, but kept the cartoon like
haracter to avoid the impression that we made any kind of morphological staining or reconstruction
of individual neurons.

Comments to the Author(s)
Specific
ntroduction
. 55 … “approximately 400 MBON neurons” As pointed out by previous reviewer #1, the actual
number is not known. The reference [15] only mentions 400 extrinsic neurons, but does not specify
output neurons.
While I have not been involved in the first review cycle of this paper, I must say that the major point
epeatedly raised by reviewer #1, the identity of MB output neurons, has not been properly
addressed by the authors. Basically, in their rebuttal the authors repeatedly state that reviewer #1 is
correct and that they plan to do intracellular recording and staining in the future. That is fine, but it
does resolve the misleading terminology in the current paper. The neurons are extrinsic Mb neurons,
and they should be referred to as such. There is no way the authors can determine if the neurons
provide output from, input to, or feedback to the MB. The authors should just omit the term MBON
hroughout the text and in the Discussion explain their reasoning why they think these neurons are
output neurons.
Author Response: We do understand the point raised by the reviewer. The traditional term for
neurons at this processing level in honeybees was mushroom body extrinsic neurons. However, this
erminology is rather indistinct. As the only intrinsic neurons in the MBs are Kenyon Cells, everything
else is extrinsic (including PNs, and basically all other brain neurons etc.). On the other hand, we
agree that the term MBON might be misleading as subpopulations of the neurons receiving input
rom the MB-KCs also interconnect to the MB lobes or provide feedback to the MB calyces. However,
he reason why we used the term MBON was that this terminology is also used, for example, in
Drosophila for neurons at this processing level. Similarly, in Drosophila some MBONs also provide
eedback (input) to other compartments of the MBs, and the nomenclature can be questioned for
he same reasons as long as it is not known whether the neurons under study are output neurons
only. However, most scientists in the community are aware of this and refer to neurons at this
processing level as MBONs, mainly because of the fact that the neurons receive input from KCs, in
honeybees as well as in Drosophila. To increase comparability between insect species we would
prefer (as we did in previous publications) to stay with this terminology and give more detail in the
ext (line 59ff.). However, in case the reviewer insists we are willing to change the term to MB
extrinsic neurons.
Methods
. 126 “…In that area MBON neurites are about ~10 µm [15] thick” This is not correct. The cited
tudy shows 2-3 large neurons with thick axons (less than 10 µm, though) in this area. Based on the
drawings and micrographs in that study, the axons of hundreds of other extrinsic neurons in the
ecording area are much thinner.
Author Response: The reviewer is right, although neurite diameters of MBENs are in the µm range
and with that much bigger than KC neurites), only the thickest ones have diameters of about 10 µm.
We changed the sentence in Line 131: “… neurites are up to ~10 µm [15] thick”.
Results
. 228 “… increases in the response rates to stimulation with the olfactory-visual compounds do not
epresent a simple summation, they suggest a more complex type of non-linear additive
computation“ This seems trivial. Neurons almost never show ‘simple summation’. The same goes for
. 257 – 261 in the Discussion.
Author Response: Although it may sound trivial to specialist readers, we still think it is important and
worth to mention this as a basic assumption and to take a broad range of potential readers (including
non-neurobiologists) on the same level.
. 244-245 “ Altogether this suggests that the MBON level represents distinct categorizations
between modalities (olfaction and vison) as well as their compound stimuli.” Unfortunately,
mportant controls seem to be missing: How do the neurons respond to the combination of two
colors or two odors? How much do those responses differ from the light/odor combinations? How do
hey differ from responses to high/low odorant concentrations or dim/bright light? What is the
evidence that the multimodal neurons discriminate modalities at all?
Author Response: In the context of the present study we think that our statement is correct! From
our earlier studies, we know that MBONs do not differentiate between different single odour
components, even when different compounds have different volatilities and, therefore, differ in their
absolute concentrations. To differentiate odours at this processing level, an odour needs to be
associated with a reward, which is another category of stimulus (we discussed that in line 280 ff).
When we presented two single odour components and their mixture (Strube-Bloss et al. 2012) all
hree stimuli evoked similar activity in MBONs. We expect the same for visual stimuli at this
processing level. Most interesting in that direction is the fact that the two light stimuli can be
discriminated by bees in a classical conditioning paradigm and evoked distinct ERG activity at the
eceptor level (ongoing study). In that context, the blue light we used can be seen already as a “light
mixture” since it also activates green receptors which are rather broadly tuned in honeybees.
However, at the MBON level blue and green light evoked the same activity (Fig 3) falling into the
ame category.
The evidence that the ensemble of multimodal MBONs discriminate modality is given in figure 4.
Here, the maximal response rates were not different when tested intramodal, but they were
different when tested between the modalities as well as between the single modalities and their
mixture. The PCA, in addition, illustrates that separation over time.
As another comment: if we would add the activity of single modal light and odour sensitive MBONs,
which represents the whole MBON ensemble we recorded, discrimination at this processing level
would be more increased, but this is trivial.
Discussion
. 291 – 293 “We found a separation in three broad categories of stimuli (odour, light and
odour+light) at the level of MBONs..” See above. In the absence of different odor or light intensity
timuli, there is no evidence that the bimodal neurons discriminate modalities. The authors only
how that more stimulus results in stronger response.
Author Response: This is correct, but here the “more” comes from two different sensory channels -
one is olfactory, the other visual, and this is the very interesting and important result we report here.
. 312 – 314 “we potentially recorded from MBONs associated with the A1, A2, A4, A5 and A7
extrinsic neuron clusters. … Therefore, each of the four response categories might be related to one
of the five cell clusters.” While the authors themselves call this speculative, this seems utterly
anciful, given that there is no evidence for this notion whatsoever. The “support” for this notion (l.
324-326) is also misleading: There is no evidence suggesting that Kenyon cells in the basal ring are
ndeed, as the authors imply, bimodal.
Author Response: We think mentioning the different morphological categories is reasonable,
especially to inspire research to perform future single cell physiology to test whether there is any
correlation. We toned down the section accordingly. In contrast to the lip and collar neuropils, the
basal ring neuropil in the honeybee receives input from olfactory, visual and most likely
gustatory/tactile projection neurons (Kirschner et al. 2006; Schroeter and Menzel 2003, and work by
Ehmer and Gronenberg 2002). Golgi studes by Starusfeld (2002) show that KC dendrites extend over
broader areas within the basal ring and into the collar. Therefore, we think it is not too far-fetched to
at least speculate that these KCs might provide multimodal input to MBONs. However, we changed
and toned down the paragraph to emphasize that this still requires functional proof (line 324ff.).

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper successfully demonstrates three categories of responses; olfactory, visual and olfactory-
visual (multimodal) type, in the ventral lobe of the mushroom body (MB), determined by
extracellular recording. Based on the results, the authors discuss about functions of the mushroom
body; integration of two sensory modalities and rapid categorization of information. The methods
are appropriate for the purpose and the data are clear. The authors respond to reviewers’ comments
well in especially about careful interpretation of the data including limitation of the method
“extracellular recording” and add some supplemental materials.
think that this work shows interesting data as a first step of study about multimodal processing to
epresent a real world in the brain. In addition, comparative aspect of this study is quite important to
understand the function of the MB among insect species. Thus this paper could attract a broad range
of readers.
Here I have some minor comments.
still concern about electrode placement verification, which the previous reviewer mentioned. Did
you confirm the position of the electrode in each animal after recording histologically? That is really
mportant point of this study. If not, how did you confirm that the electrode was NOT in the lateral
accessory lobe or the central complex? Please describe a bit more about the point.
Author Response: In the supplemental material, we show the situation that the experimenter
experiences when dissecting the honeybee brain. The vertical lobe can be clearly identified on the
brain surface, and the electrode can be placed properly at the ventral (7 o’clock position) aspect of
he vertical lobe. This provides a very clear landmark in the X-Y plane, and we have confirmed the
ecording position multiple times in previous papers using florescent dye or electrocoagulations after
ecording. We further point out that the electrode is placed at a depth between 100-200 µm (this is
properly controlled using a Sensapex micromanipulator). We do understand the reviewer’s concern,
and therefore add a statement why the depth control is important. Comparing that position with the
honeybee standard brain atlas reveals that the central complex or the LAL region (which is not very
clearly defined in the honeybee) are located at a depth of at least ~300 µm from the surface. Keeping
n mind that the standard brain was established from dissected and dehydrated brains, which causes
hrinkage, both neuropils in fresh tissue can be expected to be even deeper. Our recording electrode
was placed at a depth of ~100-200 µm and, thus, far away from both neuropils. We added the
ollowing sentence into the material section, where we describe the electrode placement.
Line 129ff: “The depth control ensures that the recording tip was at least 100 µm away from other
neuropils like the central complex or the lateral accessory lobe which are at a depth of at least 300
µm.”
L 46: not ommaditiae but ommatidia (probably)
Author Response: Thanks, we changed it.
Line 55~: MBONs integrate not only activity Kenyon Cells (KC) but also the processing of MBONs
could be modulated by aminergic neurons. I understand that you simplify the stream of processing in
he MB but because of introduction it is good to involve what kinds of information MBONs would
eceive.
Author Response: We agree with the reviewer and added the following sentence including relevant
eferences.
Line 59ff: “At this stage, sensory information converges with the reward pathway, which is facilitated
by the ventral unpaired median neuron one of the maxillary neuromere (VUMmx1)[17]. The
neurotransmitter octopamine mediates the reward [18,19].”

Appendix C
Dear Editors,
We thank you all for handling our manuscript and for your positive decision. We are confident that
he manuscript has significantly improved.
Sincerely,
Martin Strube-Bloss and Wolfgang Rössler
Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Richard Benton):
think the issue of terminology still needs to be addressed. Two reviewers (#1 and #3) raised
problem with calling the neurons MBONs, and the authors also admit it might be misleading. Rather
han using the vague MB extrinsic neuron term, I suggest the authors write in the title/abstract:
**putative/potential** mushroom body (MB) output neurons" to convey that lack of certainty from
he beginning of the paper. They could also useful put some of the discussion of terminology that
comes in their first response letter paragraph ("We do understand the point raised ...") directly into
he text at the paragraph starting line 55 so this issue (which is a larger issue in the field, and not just
his ms) is fully exposed.
Thank you Richard for this suggestion. We incorporated the term ‘putative’ into the title and added,
as suggested, an additional paragraph into the introduction (line 54), where we explain the issue that
MBON subclasses may interconnect to other MB compartments such as the MB lobes or the MB
calyx - in the honeybee as well as in Drosophila – and, thus, also provide input to the MBs. We added
appropriate references.
Kind regards,
Martin and Wolfgang
