The authors undertake an effort of formulating a variation principle for a particular dissipative
system – a viscous fluid. Such attempts have been undertaken in the past but did not led to a
success. In the present paper, the authors succeed for the first time in constructing thus
variational principle. However, the resulting equations of motion coincide with the Navier-Stokes
equations only when one of the parameters of the Lagrangian tends towards infinity. An
evaluation of the paper does depend on what is the general aim of formulating the variational
principle. It this is for later developing efficient numerical procedures, this approach may occur
too complicated. If it is developed for some general theoretical analysis, in particular for coupling
with non-dissipative system parts, it may play an important role in the future research.
In any case, I find the findings of the paper basically of interest and potentially important for
applications. It is in any case correctly designed and good explained.
Therefore, I recommend publication of the paper as it is.

Dear Authors,
This article deals with the Lagrangian formulation of equations approaching the Navier-Stockes
equation. A previous attempts by Scholle is investigated in detail, underlining its partial success
and limitations by a careful analysis of example solutions and comparison with results from the
Navier-Stokes equation. The proposed Lagrangian is then modified making use of complex
fields. The resulting equations are shown to become equivalent to Navier-Stokes in the limit
where a control parameter is sent to infinity, while deviations from this equation for a finite value
of the parameter are tentatively interpreted as thermodynamical effects beyond local equilibrium.

Overall, I find it a very good article. The results are interesting and derived in a clear and
convincing way. Figures are very instructive, well-chosen and clear, underlining some of the
main points and complementing the text, making it very easy to follow in spite of the technical
points it involves. The interpretation of the equation at finite $\omega_0$ as deviations from
local equilibrium is, in my opinion, not fully convincing, but this is not the main aim of the
article. (Although a more detailed argumentation could certainly increase the interest of the
paper.) I have not redone all the calculations, but those I have checked seem to be correct (apart
from the point 3 below). I have however a few questions and suggestions to make sure I correctly
understand the novelties and implications of this work:
1) At the beginning of Section 2, the fact that the Lagrangian remains first-order is given as one
advantage of Seliger and Whitham's formulation. Could you explain why precisely it is a benefit?
2) In equation (2.4), is there a simple argument motivating the additional term? If yes, I would
suggest to briefly mention it to make your work as self-contained as possible.
3) I suspect there is a missing factor 1/2 in the right-hand side of (2.7). (Mea culpa if I am wrong.)
4) A very minor point: at the end of Section 2.a, should not “the above examples more detailed”
read “the above examples in more details”?
5) In Section 2.b, I would suggest clarifying the status of the constants $T_0$ and $c_0$ (as well,
maybe, as $\omega_0$, although it is discussed later). Can they be chosen arbitrarily, or are there
physical constraints on their values? I would also suggest to briefly mention there how the choice
of $\omega_0$ will affect the results, to give the reader a first intuition of its physical relevance
(which is not evident at this point since $\omega_0$ can, if I am not mistaken, be absorbed by a
rescaling of $\chi$).
6) Do the results depend on the branch cut chosen for the complex logarithm? If I understand
correctly, they should be independent of it in the limit $\omega_0 \to \infty$ (is this correct?),
but I currently do not see why this should remain true for finite values of $\omega_0$. Could
you please explain what changes you expect from a different choice of branch cut, along with its
physical relevance, or why they are independent of it?
7) I find the analysis of Section 3 very interesting. I am not sure, however, that it is strictly
necessary. Indeed, if I am not mistaken, the results can also be recovered more directly using the
standard Lagrangian formalism when including distributions. Extracting the singular part of the
corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations give the matching conditions of subsections 3b and 3c,
while their continuous parts give the results of subsection 3a. Nevertheless, your analysis is
interesting as it does not rely on distributions. I would thus suggest keeping it, but mentioning
that the results can also be recovered using the standard treatment when including distributions,
so that readers familiar with it can more easily see the origin of the matching conditions.
8) Again a very minor point: at the beginning of subsection 3b, I would suggest replacing
“itselves” by “themselves”.
9) Still a very minor point: below equation (3.8), I would suggest replacing “hence the integral
(3.1)” by “hence the integral (3.4)”.
10) At the beginning of subsection 4.b, I would suggest replacing “As shown in Sect. (b)” by “As
shown in Sect. (3.b)”.
11) Below equation (4.12), concerning the interfaces at which energy dissipation occurs: The
presence of these interfaces seems to be an artifact of the model (although they may well
accurately describe a (regular) physical effect). Could you comment on their status, in particular:
4
*How would they be affected by a change of branch cut for the complex logarithm? Would
such a change be physically relevant?
*Given a physical flow, is there a phenomenon analogous to this production of inner energy at
an interface? If yes, is there a typical regularization scale?
12) In the first paragraph of section 6, the limit $\omega_0 \to 0$ appears twice. If I am not
mistaken, this should be replaced by $\omega_0 \to \infty$.
13) In the last paragraph of section 6, I find the formulation “an extension of Lagrange formalism
was necessary” slightly overstated given that the matching conditions can, if I am correct, also be
recovered using the standard treatment.
14) Finally, in the line below equation (A 18), I think the bar on $\xi$ should be deleted.
To summarize, apart from the points 5, 6, 7, and 11 above which, in my opinion, should be
clarified for the novel aspects and implications of this work to be fully apparent, I think this is a
very interesting and sound article which certainly deserves publication.

onstructive hints given by it leading to a relevant improvement of the
anuscript.
e revised the manuscript according to the reviewer’s suggestions, with
he changes marked by red coloring.
n detail:
eviewer’s comment 1: At the beginning of Section 2, the fact that the
agrangian remains first-order is given as one advantage of Seliger and
hitham's formulation. Could you explain why precisely it is a benefit?
nswer: A first order Lagrangian is useful with respect to the
omputation of (i) the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations and (ii)
he canonical densities and flux densities resulting from Noether's
heorem. Apart from this, it is very useful when applying Ritz's direct
ethod to problems formulated in curvilinear coordinates. If on the other
and second order or higher order derivatives occur in the Lagrangian,
he above-mentioned calculations become more complicated. We added two
entences for explanation.
eviewer’s comment 2: In equation (2.4), is there a simple argument
otivating the additional term? If yes, I would suggest to briefly
ention it to make your work as self-contained as possible.
nswer: There is, of course, no strict derivation for this term but at
east it should be pointed out that it does not contradict basic
rinciples and that there are plausible ideas motivating it. For this
ake we added a few sentences mainly based on physical arguments and on
oether’s theorem, giving motivation for the analytical form of the
dditional term.
eviewer’s comment 3: I suspect there is a missing factor 1/2 in the
ight-hand side of (2.7). (Mea culpa if I am wrong.)
nswer: You are absolutely right! Thank you!
eviewer’s comment 4: A very minor point: at the end of Section 2.a,
hould not “the above examples more detailed” read “the above examples in
ore details”?
nswer: This sounds indeed better! We have altered this text passage.
eviewer’s comment 5: In Section 2.b, I would suggest clarifying the
tatus of the constants $T_0$ and $c_0$ (as well, maybe, as $\omega_0$,
lthough it is discussed later). Can they be chosen arbitrarily, or are
here physical constraints on their values? I would also suggest to
riefly mention there how the choice of $\omega_0$ will affect the
which is not evident at this point since $\omega_0$ can, if I am not
istaken, be absorbed by a rescaling of $\chi$).
nswer: In the special but very relevant case of an incompressible flow
ith constant specific heat the choice of $c_0$ is clear and the choice
f $T_0$ is arbitrary and has no effect on physics. For the more general
ase of an compressible flow with non-constant specific heat it is
easonable to choose the reference temperature $T_0$ as a 'typical'
emperature and $c_0$ as a 'typical' specific heat, depending on the
ndividual physical problem.
e added some sentences regarding this point and gave a hint that the
hoice of $\omega_0$ is neither obvious nor how physics is affected by it
nd that this will be analysed and discussed in the following section.
egarding the conjecture that $\omega_0$ could be absorbed by a rescaling
f $\chi$, we can make sure that this is indeed not possible: looking at
he Lagrangian (2.27), one might get the impression that e.g. by making
se of the transformation $\chi/\sqrt{\omega_0} -> \chi$ would vanish
rom the Lagrangian, but on the other hand one has to keep in mind that
he specific inner energy $e$ also depends on $\chi$, so the $\omega_0$-
ependence would only be shifted to the inner energy term. This becomes
articularly visible by considering the Lagrangian (2.31) related to the
ncompressible case with constant heat capacity.
eviewer’s comment 6: Do the results depend on the branch cut chosen for
he complex logarithm? If I understand correctly, they should be
ndependent of it in the limit $\omega_0 \to \infty$ (is this correct?),
ut I currently do not see why this should remain true for finite values
f $\omega_0$. Could you please explain what changes you expect from a
ifferent choice of branch cut, along with its physical relevance, or why
hey are independent of it?
nswer: Yes, it is correct that an alternative choice of the branch cut
f the complex logarithm does not affect the results for the limit case
\omega_0 \to \infty$. For finite $\omega_0$, it would indeed have an
ffect on the equations of motion, for more details see the text added at
he end of Sect. 4 and our reply to (11).
eviewer’s comment 7: I find the analysis of Section 3 very interesting.
am not sure, however, that it is strictly necessary. Indeed, if I am
ot mistaken, the results can also be recovered more directly using the
tandard Lagrangian formalism when including distributions. Extracting
he singular part of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations give the
atching conditions of subsections 3b and 3c, while their continuous
arts give the results of subsection 3a. Nevertheless, your analysis is
nteresting as it does not rely on distributions. I would thus suggest
eeping it, but mentioning that the results can also be recovered using
he standard treatment when including distributions, so that readers
amiliar with it can more easily see the origin of the matching
onditions.
nswer: This is an excellent idea: Reducing formalism for discontinuous
ystems to the standard formalism using distributions. We worked out this
dea for the production condition in 3c and put it in the appendix (Sect.
btained even without distribution theory by means of an analogy with the
o-called „natural boundary conditions“ at the phase boundaries in a
ultiphase flow when assuming that all phases of the flow consist of the
ame liquid. We added a short note on this at the end of Sect 3b.
eviewer’s comment 8: Again a very minor point: at the beginning of
ubsection 3b, I would suggest replacing “itselves” by “themselves”.
nswer: Correct! We replaced it.
eviewer’s comment 9: Still a very minor point: below equation (3.8), I
ould suggest replacing “hence the integral (3.1)” by “hence the integral
3.4)”.
nswer: Right, it is much better to refer to the variation of the action
ntegral, not to the action integral itself. We replaced it.
eviewer’s comment 10: At the beginning of subsection 4.b, I would
uggest replacing “As shown in Sect. (b)” by “As shown in Sect. (3.b)”.
nswer: We now have added the section number. It is an individual feature
f the Royal Society LaTeX style, that \ref{subsection} provides the
etter of the subsection, only. Thus, one has to make use of
ref{section}\ref{subsection} for referencing both the section number
ith the subsection letter. We did this now consequently throughout the
hole paper.
eviewer’s comment 11: Below equation (4.12), concerning the interfaces
t which energy dissipation occurs: The presence of these interfaces
eems to be an artifact of the model (although they may well accurately
escribe a (regular) physical effect). Could you comment on their status,
n particular:
*How would they be affected by a change of branch cut for the complex
ogarithm? Would such a change be physically relevant?
*Given a physical flow, is there a phenomenon analogous to this
roduction of inner energy at an interface? If yes, is there a typical
egularization scale?
nswer: These all are legitimate questions requiring a more detailed
iscussion, which is given at the end of Sect. 4. When establishing a
odel, there is of course never an absolute sureness if the reality is
ccurately mapped by it. The only thing one can do is to make sure that
he model is self-consistent. Therefore, the question regarding the
elected branch cut for the complex logarithm is of relevance. According
o the analysis added at the end of Sect. 4, an alternative choice of the
ranch cut for the complex logarithm will alter the fluctuating
dditional forces occurring in the equations of motion for finite
\omega_0$. Hence, these differences vanish in the limit case
\omega_0\to \infty$. For finite $\omega_0$, however, a physical argument
ould fit best to reality. According to the characterization of the
dditional forces appearing in the equations of motion as fluctuations,
t is expected that the have to vanish by means of time/space/ensemble
veraging. This criterion is fulfilled by making use of the standard
ranch cut for the complex logarithm.
eviewer’s comment 12: In the first paragraph of section 6, the limit
\omega_0 \to 0$ appears twice. If I am not mistaken, this should be
eplaced by $\omega_0 \to \infty$.
nswer: Absolutely correct! $\omega_0 \to 0$ does not make sense.
eviewer’s comment 13: In the last paragraph of section 6, I find the
ormulation “an extension of Lagrange formalism was necessary” slightly
verstated given that the matching conditions can, if I am correct, also
e recovered using the standard treatment.
nswer: This is indeed not a good formulation: it might also sound
verstated, but it definitely overemphasises the mathematical procedure
ompared to its physical meaning. We therefore modified the first
entence by the moderated formulation:
By evaluating the dynamics induced by the Lagrangian (2.31), it has been
emonstrated how Lagrange formalism applies to physical problems with
iscontinuities.“ by which the physical meaning is more emphasised as it
hould be.
eviewer’s comment 14: Finally, in the line below equation (A 18), I
hink the bar on $\xi$ should be deleted.
nswer: This formula is correct, since derivation of
