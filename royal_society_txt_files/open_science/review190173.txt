Manuscript: RSOS-190173 – Electiveness of agro-pulping process in the sustainable production of
black liquor-based activated carbons
Corresponding Author: AH Basta
All authors: VF Lotfy and AH Basta
Present manuscript refers to the production of activated carbons using by-products. I think that
the scope of this manuscript is important and valuable for the scientific community. However,
some important aspects are missing and should be addressed in order to publish the present
paper. Overall, English should be very carefully revised since it is difficult to point out all the
weaknesses; I suggest the revision of the manuscript by a person whose mother language is
English. Also, the aim and the novelty of the work should be clearer. My recommendation for this
manuscript is major revision, based on the stated above and on the following:
Abstract
- First sentence: I suggest to changing it to “During the production of paper pulp, the waste water
loaded with organic materials from pulping process is discharged.”
- Sentence “The trial process to utilize such effluent for production of activated carbon will be
effective for omitting the wastewater treatment, together with obtaining value and demand
product.” is confusing. Should be rephrased for clarity.
- Refer to SBET, as “specific surface area”.
- All the abbreviations should be defined, even those that are triter as MB, FTIR, SEM or ACs.
- Define NSP.
- Use the abbreviations SCB and RS for the first time when they are written in full (line 17).
- Avoid the use of “&”.
- Last sentence (“It interesting to note that BL disposed from RS-NSP provides AC is more
efficient adsorption capacity for I2 and MB than that produced from RS- pulp fibers.”): correct the
EN language.
Introduction
- Page 2, Line 46: Change “in production valuable products” to “the production of valuable
products”.
- Page 2, Line 50: Change “agro-wastes paper pulping” to “paper pulping agro-wastes”.
- Page 2, Line 55: Define RS.
- Page 3, Line 8: Use “for synthesis of chemicals” or for synthesizing chemicals”.
- Page 3, Line 15 vs Line 19: Define activated carbons the first time they are mentioned (in line 15,
not 19!). This issue with the abbreviations should be carefully revised in the whole manuscript!
- Page 3, Line 19: This sentence would be worthy more references.
- Page 3, Lines 34 and 38: Avoid the use of words as “my” and “we”.
- Page 3, Lines 36: Correct the typo.
- End of the introduction: The aim of the work should be clearer! Nowadays, there are plenty of
works dealing with the production of ACs, using agro- or industrial-wastes. Which is the main
driving force of this study? What is the novelty?
- The importance of the adsorbate chosen should be addressed. Why MB is important to be
adsorbed? Why MB constitute a problem?
3
- Did the authors considered the circular economy approach? It would be interesting to link this
type of work to that approach, since it deals with wastes and giving them an added-value.
Experimental
- Figure should be numbered and mentioned in the text.
- Page 4, Line 48: Avoid the term “our”.
- Page 4, Line 50: BLs were already defined. Once again, the issue of the abbreviations should be
carefully revised in the whole manuscript!
- Page 6, Line 23: Which are the reasons for that high concentration levels?
- Page 6, Line 29: How the authors performed the UV-vis measures? Was the matrix of the AC
taken into account? The measures should be performed against the matrix. Please comment.
- Page 7, Line 49: Do the authors think that the kinetic models used may help in gathering
knowledge about mechanisms of adsorption?
- Page 8, Line 19: Do the authors believe that the FTIR-KBr is the best option? Would not be better
to use ATR-FTIR? Please comment.
- Page 8, Line 29: Correct the title of section 2.3.2.4 to “microscopy”.
Results
- I wonder why the elemental analysis and the TGs were performed solely for the BLs and not for
the ACs. I think it would be useful to do such characterization for the ACs as well. Please
comment.
- Do the authors have the possibility of measure the TOC of the materials? It would be an
important measure to complement the characterization.
Tables and Figures
- Figure 3 is a duplication of data from Table 3. Use either the Figure or the Table.
- Kinetics and isotherms should be presented in a figure.
Manuscript General Comment: I have to stress that the manuscript should be carefully revised,
mostly to improve the English, but also to correct the countless typos (I started to address those
but it is impossible for the referee to do such action when there are so many!). Also, attention
should be paid to the abbreviations’ issue that I’ve already stated but that happens countless
times.

Answer,
1
The corrections are made as the reviewer asked
- End of the introduction: The aim of the work should be clearer! Nowadays, there are
plenty of works dealing with the production of ACs, using agro- or industrial-wastes.
Which is the main driving force of this study? What is the novelty?
Answer
We replaced the last paragraph of Introduction section by the following sentences.
In this present article the black liquors as a whole, which resulted from pulping of rice
straw are used for production of ACs. The type of pulping processes of RS (alkaline, acidic
and neutral) are optimized, and compared with BLs produced from sugar-cane bagasse
(SCB). Moreover, the performance of BL-based ACs, will be compared with previously
produced ACs from RS- and SCB pulp fibers [37]. The choice of SCB for comparison is
based on this residue already used in local paper mills for production of paper products.
- The importance of the adsorbate chosen should be addressed. Why MB is important to be
adsorbed? Why MB constitute a problem?
Answer
The Standard tests to evaluate the adsorption capacity of any carbon material are
focused on studying its surface area, as well as its adsorption capacity to
methylene blue and iodine value. These tests were conducted as an indicator to the
efficiency of material to remove the contaminants from liquids, especially dys.
These evaluations are reported in many literatures. Moreover these tests were
performed till we can compare the obtained results with the previous performed
ACs from RS and SCB pulps, which evaluated by the same tests.
With thanks for this inquire.
- Did the authors considered the circular economy approach? It would be interesting to
link this type of work to that approach, since it deals with wastes and giving them an
added-value.
Answer
Thank you for this comment; I know it will be very useful to perform the feasibility study,
as a stage for production in industrial scale. But her I refereed to economic production,
based on minimizing the stages via using the black liquor as a whole (without passing for
precipitation to separate the lignin,… etc), moreover preserving the cost of pretreatment of
water before its discharge to the drainage, for keeping the level of COD and BOD.
LORD willing, I’ll perform the feasibility study after finishing from other approaches
undertaken in forthcoming 3 articles, to recommend the efficient process.
3. Comments related to Experimental section
- Figure should be numbered and mentioned in the text.
Answer
Thank you, I referred to this Fig as Diagram 1.
- Page 4, Line 48: Avoid the term “our”.
- Page 4, Line 50: BLs were already defined. Once again, the issue of the abbreviations
should be carefully revised in the whole manuscript!
Answer
In Materials section I referred to black liquors together with the abbreviation BLs, while for
sequence paragraphs and all articles I referred to these precursors by abbreviation, with
thanks.
- Page 6, Line 23: Which are the reasons for that high concentration levels?
2
Answer
Thank you, as I illustrated before all performed tests are proceeds based on the tests which
already performed in our previous articles, and till give me the opportunity to specify the
efficiency of the recent activated carbon when compared with ACs produced from pulp
fibers.
- Page 6, Line 29: How the authors performed the UV-vis measures? Was the matrix of the
AC taken into account? The measures should be performed against the matrix. Please
comment.
Answer
In the revised Ms. I added the sentences "and using pre-plot standard curve".
- Page 7, Line 49: Do the authors think that the kinetic models used may help in gathering
knowledge about mechanisms of adsorption?
Answer
The fit of observed date to Pseudo-second-order kinetic model will increases the probability
of the chemisorption adsorption mechanism. Moreover, fitting of experimental data to
pseudo second order model and Langmuir isotherm model usually signifies chemisorption.
This opinion was supported by many researchers. With many thanks for this comment.
- Page 8, Line 19: Do the authors believe that the FTIR-KBr is the best option? Would not be
better to use ATR-FTIR? Please comment.
Answer
I agree about the Fourier Transfrom Infra-Red-Attenuated Total Reflectance (FTIR-ATR),
is best technique, because it can distinguish components (macerals) of carbon material
which have diverse chemical compositions and physical properties, quantifying the
abundance of chemical functional groups, but this Instrument not available in many
Institutes like us. Therefore, limited studies have reported via using ATR-FTIR spectra for
qualitatively evaluating ACs or other carbon materials. Moreover, we focused on
instruments available to us in my Institute, and all tests covered by private money, till my
student have publ’s. for her promotion. The FTIR spectra only show the presence of surface
functional groups.
Could you please check the item Funding which reported before References
section "Funding is self-employed from all authors".
- Page 8, Line 29: Correct the title of section 2.3.2.4 to “microscopy”.
Answer
We corrected this word, with thanks.
4. Comments related to Results section
- I wonder why the elemental analysis and the TGs were performed solely for the BLs and not
for the ACs. I think it would be useful to do such characterization for the ACs as well.
Please comment.
Answer
Many thanks for this comment, but could you please recheck the paragraphs related to these
characteristics. These studies were concerned on examine the role of pulping process on
performance of black liquor as a precursor for production of ACs. Therefore the indicator
factor for changing the adsorption capacity of the resulted ACs, is chemical constituents of
BL vs pulping process, The chemical analyses test were carried out to indicate the
constituents of black liquors (lignin and hydrolyzed hemicelluloses), which are related to
delignification degree of pulping process. The H/C and O/C were calculated as supporting
3
data to pulping process. I think these constituents will further affect on thermal stability, as
all knowledge about the greater stability of lignin than hemicellulose.
The TGA is carried out to indicate the trend of weight loss of BL versus
carbonization temperature. The pulping processes significant affect on weight loss, and
consequently the char (weight remain). I think this analyses on precursors will be very
useful than on produced ACs.
This study also illustrated the efficiciency of BLs than pulp fibers, where the weight loss of
un- and RS and SCB pulps are greater than the case of BLs. This is attributed to the higher
organic matter contents, especially cellulose (C and H) of un- and pulped fibers as compared
with BLs. We ascribed this observation to the degradation of cellulose leads to formation of
levoglucosan which promotes the volatilization stage. This difference is greater in case of
soda pulping of RS.
- Do the authors have the possibility of measure the TOC of the materials? It would be an
important measure to complement the characterization.
Answer
Thank you, I think the TGA analysis of BLs will illustrates the inorganic materials included
the carbon residues after pyrolysis, at temperature in the range 500-900 oC. The remained
weight after pyrolysis will give us information dealing carbon material purity
The silica content included the carbon material, may provides improvement in adsorption
capacity, therefore we focused on applying the ACs as a whole.
LORD willing we will take this measurement in our further publication.
5. Comments related to Tables and Figures
- Figure 3 is a duplication of data from Table 3. Use either the Figure or the Table.
Answer
Thank you, but could you please check again Fig. 3, as it included the data of SBET and VT
versus BLs-ACs, in comparison with previous data related to ACs from pulp fibers; While
Table 3 only included all textural characterization of various BL-ACs
- Kinetics and isotherms should be presented in a figure.
Answer
We employed kinetics and isotherms, related to AC from RS-BL, as example, because it
provided well-defined adsorption ( please see page 22).
Based on the shift in number of Figs, as 3rd comment of Reviewer 2 comments (3.The
structure of this paper should well organize. For example, the IR and SEM results should
be in front of the adsorption results of iodine and MB), this Fig. will take the No. Fig. 7.
I’m sorry about the language; we carefully corrected the language in revised version, with
thanks.

This manuscript presents a simple procedure to prepare cost-effective porous activated
carbons from black liquor during production of paper pulp using phosphoric acid as activation
agent. The result carbons were used as aqueous adsorbates. The work is interesting and the
manuscript is well organized. However, the authors should address the questions below:
1. As the author said, there are lot of micropores for the ACs, so for the N2 adsorption-
desorption isotherms, more points at the low pressure range (<0,1) should be present.
Answer

Thank you about your decision which give us the opportunity to extent our publication in
Royal Society Open Science.
With regard to reviewer comment, the t-plot or alpha -plot is used to estimate the type of
porosity (micro/or meso ), but because the Instrument used in this test (USA Nova 3200
Nitrogen Phesosorption Quantachrom Instrument), not in mine and the test are performed in
other Lab by Technician, therefore I can't suggest and put many points to measure, which
requires time consuming, especially the liquid nitrogen is not available for this Lab all times,
May we wait months to analyze the samples due to this problem. The measurements of micro,
meso and total are already performed by software of Instrument.
Based on our information's' on applying SPE method, despite no data appear at low
pressure, the test indicates the micropore volume included the sample. therefore please
forgive me if I can't response
2. For confirming, the pore size distribution from N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms should
also add in the text.
Answer
