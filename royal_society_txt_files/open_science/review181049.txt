Schizophrenia risk and reproductive success: A Mendelian randomization study.
Lawn et al.
This study investigated if increased genetic liability for schizophrenia was associated with
reproductive advantage. The authors used GWAS summary statistics from the Psychiatric
Genomics Consortium (PGC) for the schizophrenia, which were used in a genetic association
analysis (by linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC)) and also used in a Mendelian
randomization analysis as exposure data. The authors also used Uk Biobank data for which
reproductive traits (age at first birth and number of children) as well as individual genotyped
data were available. The study tested the genetic association and causal effect of schizophrenia
genetic risk with number of children and age at first birth and reported that there was no
significance.
This is interesting study trying to tackle the old puzzle (how is schizophrenia maintained in the
population given its apparent fitness costs?). The authors tested one of plausible reasons that
increased genetic risk for schizophrenia is associated with reproductive advantage. However,
there is no clear evidence from the analysis results.
I have a number of questions and comments.
1. The authors reported that the genetic correlations from LDSC analysis were not different from
zero. Given that the true relationship between schizophrenia (genetic risk) and the reproductive
traits, it may not be very good idea to use LDSC which is a linear additive model. For example,
the authors should estimate genetic correlation between schizophrenia genetic risk and age at
first birth less than its mean value.
A recent study (referenced as #24 in this paper) reported that a significant negative correlation
between schizophrenia genetic risk and age at first birth < its mean. They also reported a
significant heterogeneity between younger and older age at first birth.
2. The trait, number of children, may be highly (negatively) correlated with age at first birth.
Should the authors consider multivariate analysis (age at first birth and # children as multiple
dependent variables)? Or, at least did they adjust the effects of age at first birth on # children?
3. How the authors controlled heterogeneity between male and females? I would suggest number
of children analysis should be analysed for female only or male only.
4. Figures shows that there is not significant difference of mean # children (or age at first birth)
across different schizophrenia genetic liability levels. However, this would be only one
dimension of the relationship. The authors should check if there is significant difference of mean
schizophrenia genetic liability across different # children or age at first birth.
3
5. If there are unmeasured confounders, how they will affect the results for the Mendelian
randomization analysis? How did the authors control such unmeasured confounders or variables
possibly having effects on the exposure and/or outcome data? Did the authors test reverse causal
effects, i.e. causal effects of reproductive traits on the schizophrenia genetic liability?
6. I see there was relatedness quality control for UK Biobank (page 5). But how did the authors
make sure there was no duplicated or close relatives between PGC and UK Biobank?
7. In Methods, it is not clear how many SNPs were used for the LDSC analyses. How many
individuals were used for UK Biobank (for # children and age at first birth analyses)?

Lawn et al reported in their paper entitled “Schizophrenia risk and reproductive success: A
Mendelian randomization study” results of their study investigating whether the stable
prevalence of schizophrenia (SCZ) over populations can be explained from some SCZ-induced
reproductive advantages. They undertook this task with UK Biobank data for number of children
and age at first birth in females and SCZ GWAS summary data using a set of advanced genetic
analyses. In summary, no genetic associations were found between SCZ and number of children
and age at first birth in females, using both LD score regression and two-sample Mendelian
randomization analyses. These results were further observed from the non-significant association
between SCZ genetic liability (risk score) and mean number of children and mean age at first
birth. They, therefore, suggested two explanations for the stable prevalence of SCZ: SCZ-related
genetic variants are too tiny to be under negative selection; and the mutation-selection balance.
Overall, this is a very well-written and well-designed and executed study.
One suggestion is to add a caveat in the Discussion that the maintenance about genetic variation
4
that we observe today (in a contemporary population) is the result of historical evolutionary
forces. It is not necessarily the case that the human population is in some kind of equilibrium so
that we can infer maintenance of schizophrenia-associated alleles from fitness present-day fitness
associations. For example, reproduction has undergone dramatic changes in the last ~50 years
because of the availability of contraceptives.
The (minor) specific comments below are provided to improve the manuscript.
1. Page 4 (line 30): The authors utilised education attainment (EA) GWAS published by Okbay et
al. in their paper. While to my knowledge, recently there is another much powerful EA GWAS
(Lee et al. 2018 Nature Genetics) performed from ~1.1 million individuals. It would be better to
re-do the analyses using the latest EA GWAS. However, since the results are unlikely to change
substantially the authors should decide whether it is worth the effort.
2. Page 4 (‘Exposure data’ section): The author should explain more on why also use EA as the
exposure data in analyses. For sensitivity comparison? If so, why choose EA, not other psychiatric
disorders related to reproduction, such as autism?
3. Page 5 (line 37-38): I wonder if the authors checked the distribution of “number of children”
phenotype (i.e are there any ‘outlier’ individuals who had a large number of children?). I am also
interested in seeing the similarity of “number of children they had given birth to” (female-
specific) and “number of children they had fathered” (male-specific) from the true spouses (there
are about 1200 known spouse pairs in UK Biobank and about 20,000 inferred spouse pairs), to
check the divorce rate which may be a confounder for MR analyses.
4. Page 5 (‘Outcome measures’ section): One suggestion is to also take reproductive failure (e.g
ever have pregnancy termination, miscarriage) into account in the analyses as a covariate,
particularly for the “childless” phenotype.
5. Page 5 (line 41): It is possible to generate a sample for age at first birth in males from
identification of potential spouses?
6. Page 5 (line 54-55); Page 6 (line 7-8); Page 7 (line 11): how about fitting all the models (i.e.
GWAS, MR, the genetic score-liability regression) with both assessment centre and genotype
batch as covariates?
7. Page 7 (line 15): I wonder if it is possible to run MR using “number of children” or “age at first
birth” as exposure and EA as outcome, to examine the potential bi-directional association
between EA and number of children and age at first birth, depending on whether there is enough
independent genome-wide significant (p < 5e-08) or suggestive (p < 1e-05) SNPs associated with
number of children and age at first birth.
8. Table 1 (line 13); Table 2 (line 21 & 24): p-value are not written in a same format.
9. Table 2 (line 14-15): The MR-Egger results for SCZ-age at first birth seems different from other
models. The intercept of MR-Egger regression was estimated differently from 0 at a significance
level of 5%, indicating the existence of pleiotropic SNP effects. If this is the case, the author
should acknowledge it as a potential limitation.
10. Page 8 (line 16): Figure 2 showed some evidence for a ‘U’ shape curve between SCZ and age at
first birth. Since there is a study (Ni et al. 2018 Scientific Reports) published recently also utilised
UKB sample and found a ‘U’ shape relationship between age at first birth in women and SCZ,
5
maybe it is worth trying to divide the sample into more quantiles (i.e 7 or 9) to check the
relationship?
11. Page 11 (line 47): there is a typo in reference #3.
12. Supplementary Figures 1-3 (and description in main text): Comment. This looks like what
might be expected under stabilising selection, even if the quadratic term is not statistically
significant. Perhaps this could be lack of power? In the future (next few years), the accuracy of
schizophrenia liability prediction is going to be better so the issue can be revisited.

The authors have done a good job in their revision. The addition of the number of sexual partners
adds interest. Please note that the genetic correlation in liability to schizophrenia between males
and females is very high and to my knowledge not significantly different from 1.

Appendix A
Dear Editor,
Thank you for the opportunity to improve our paper by addressing editorial and referees’
comments. We have now done so and provide a point by point response to these.
Reviewer 1
1. The authors reported that the genetic correlations from LDSC analysis were not different from
ero. Given that the true relationship between schizophrenia (genetic risk) and the reproductive
raits, it may not be very good idea to use LDSC which is a linear additive model. For example, the
authors should estimate genetic correlation between schizophrenia genetic risk and age at first birth
ess than its mean value.
A recent study (referenced as #24 in this paper) reported that a significant negative correlation
between schizophrenia genetic risk and age at first birth < its mean. They also reported a significant
heterogeneity between younger and older age at first birth.
Response: We agree that it is important to consider non-linear approaches here. The cited study
aimed to examine whether age at first birth of mothers may predict the schizophrenia risk of
offspring, using the interim genetic release of UK Biobank data. In our study, the hypothesis was in
he other direction. Here, we aimed to examine genetic liability for schizophrenia on age at first birth
where, under a cliff edge-hypothesis, we assume a linear relationship between genetic liability and
eproductive advantage in a non-case population (pre-cliff).
As this is an assumption, we also conducted sensitivity analyses to assess non-linear relationships,
assessing non-linearity of our independent variable, schizophrenia genetic liability. Previously, we had
plotted age at first birth across quintiles of the genetic score for schizophrenia liability. We have now
conducted the same sensitivity analysis for age at first birth as done for number of children to
examine non-linearity further (Table 4 and Supplementary Table S6; Figure S10). We do see weak
evidence for a quadratic association between the genetic score for schizophrenia liability and age at
irst birth and have now moved this table from supplementary to the manuscript (Table 4).
The cited study also identified an association when not splitting by the mean which we do not find. As
he cited study used the interim release of UK Biobank genetic data (N = 38,892), where inclusion in
his sub-sample is related to smoking status (Wain et al. 2015, Lancet Respir Med), division is
herefore similar to stratifying on smoking status. Individuals with schizophrenia are more likely to
moke and smoking may therefore be a collider and introduce selection bias.
2. The trait, number of children, may be highly (negatively) correlated with age at first birth. Should
he authors consider multivariate analysis (age at first birth and # children as multiple dependent
variables)? Or, at least did they adjust the effects of age at first birth on # children?
Response: Unfortunately, it is not possible to conduct our Mendelian randomization (our main
analysis), with multiple outcomes simultaneously. Nevertheless, we agree that these are likely part of
he same causal pathway and are not attempting to understand the effects of number of children
hat is not via age at first birth.
3. How the authors controlled heterogeneity between male and females? I would suggest number of
children analysis should be analysed for female only or male only.
Response: The schizophrenia data are not available by sex and we therefore did not run the no. of
children MR analysis stratified by sex, although we did adjust for sex when generating summary
tatistics. Although we had also adjusted for sex in quadratic regressions of the genetic risk score to
number of children, we have also now added sex stratified regression and quadratic results (Table 4).
Although this will suffer from some bias as the genetic variants were identified in a mixed sex
population, our use of an unweighted genetic score should be less biased than the weighted MR
methods for sex stratified analysis. These regressions test for a causal effect of genetic liability for
chizophrenia on number of children and show no clear evidence for either number of births or
children fathered. We now highlight the potential limitation of sex-stratified analysis in the
discussion. We already present plots in supplementary material that assess the non-linear
elationship stratified by sex, again showing little statistical evidence in either sex (Supplementary
igures S7-S9).
n Response to reviewer 2, we have now added number of sexual partners as an outcome and include
he same sex stratified analysis as for number of children. In this, we find some evidence of a positive
effect of genetic liability for schizophrenia on number of sexual partners in combined sexes (mean
difference: 0.165 increase in number of sexual partners, 95% CI: 0.117 to 0.212, p =5.30×10-10) (Table
2). We also find a linear positive relationship between genetic liability for schizophrenia and number
of sexual partners in males and females separately (Tables 4).
4. Figures shows that there is not significant difference of mean # children (or age at first birth)
across different schizophrenia genetic liability levels. However, this would be only one dimension of
he relationship. The authors should check if there is significant difference of mean schizophrenia
genetic liability across different # children or age at first birth.
Response: As mentioned above, our approach was to examine genetic liability for schizophrenia on
age at first birth and number of children, in line with the plots we present in the manuscript.
Nevertheless, we have now added these figures to the supplementary material for all main outcomes
Supplementary Figures S4-S6). The figures again show little evidence of heterogeneity across number
of children or categories of age at first birth.
5. If there are unmeasured confounders, how they will affect the results for the Mendelian
andomization analysis? How did the authors control such unmeasured confounders or variables
possibly having effects on the exposure and/or outcome data? Did the authors test reverse causal
effects, i.e. causal effects of reproductive traits on the schizophrenia genetic liability?
Response: By using independent genetic variants as instruments, MR exploits Mendel’s laws of
egregation and independent assortment by which inheritance of genetic variants is determined
mostly independently of other genetic variants and the environment. The method therefore reduces
bias due to confounding to which non-genetic observational studies are prone. As we used summary
GWAS data from the PGC, we could not test this assumption for our exposure data. We did test the
genetic score for schizophrenia against environmental factors measured in UK Biobank and observed
associations for smoking status and SES (in females). It is possible that these reflect causal pathways
Wootton et al. 2018, doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/381301). As our results do not provide clear
evidence for the associations we examined, we are less concerned that results are due to
confounding, especially in an MR framework. As genotype is determined at conception, MR removes
he risk of reverse causality and we therefore did not test reverse effects.
6. I see there was relatedness quality control for UK Biobank (page 5). But how did the authors make
ure there was no duplicated or close relatives between PGC and UK Biobank?
Response: Our use of summary level GWAS data from the PGC means that we cannot determine
whether participants had relatives across the samples. However, as the PGC uses a case-control
design with samples from several countries we assume the likelihood of having related participants
across samples to be low. We now discuss this in the limitations section.
7. In Methods, it is not clear how many SNPs were used for the LDSC analyses. How many individuals
were used for UK Biobank (for # children and age at first birth analyses)?
Response: We apologise for not previously including the number of SNPs in LDSC analysis and have
now included this in the results section and table caption. We have also included the reported N of
ndividuals from the table caption in the results section. In doing so, we noticed that whilst we were
using the estimates from the Schizophrenia GWAS with Europeans only, we had reported the sample
ize for the GWAS including non-Europeans. We have now corrected this.
Reviewer 2
One suggestion is to add a caveat in the Discussion that the maintenance about genetic variation that
we observe today (in a contemporary population) is the result of historical evolutionary forces. It is
not necessarily the case that the human population is in some kind of equilibrium so that we can
nfer maintenance of schizophrenia-associated alleles from fitness present-day fitness associations.
For example, reproduction has undergone dramatic changes in the last ~50 years because of the
availability of contraceptives.
Response: We agree that there are limits to the conclusions we can make about historical
evolutionary forces of schizophrenia-associated alleles from present-day fitness associations,
especially with the availability of contraception in evolutionarily recent times. As well as adding text
o the discussion on these points, we have also added number of sexual partners as an outcome for
analyses. Number of sexual partners has likely also undergone changes since the introduction of
contraception, which has allowed for decoupling of sexual and reproductive partners. However, we
eel that this outcome adds another dimension to the study of potential reproductive success. Number
of sexual partners has previously been used in studies as a measure of mating success and potential
eproductive success in modern human populations (reference 4 in the manuscript). These results
how a positive effect of genetic liability for schizophrenia on number of sexual partners using MR,
although we find no clear evidence of a genetic correlation using LDSC, which has implications for the
maintenance of schizophrenia in non-contracepting populations, although any inferences here are
peculative (Tables 1 and 2).
The (minor) specific comments below are provided to improve the manuscript.
1. Page 4 (line 30): The authors utilised education attainment (EA) GWAS published by Okbay et al.
n their paper. While to my knowledge, recently there is another much powerful EA GWAS (Lee et al.
2018 Nature Genetics) performed from ~1.1 million individuals. It would be better to re-do the
analyses using the latest EA GWAS. However, since the results are unlikely to change substantially
he authors should decide whether it is worth the effort.
Response: Although the more recent GWAS of educational attainment includes more individuals, it
also includes UK Biobank and would therefore cause sample overlap in our analyses. Sample overlap
biases the results of MR towards the observed association, therefore we chose to use the earlier
GWAS. We also agree that the results with a larger GWAS are unlikely to substantially change our
esults, given we find robust results using our measure as a positive control.
2. Page 4 (‘Exposure data’ section): The author should explain more on why also use EA as the
exposure data in analyses. For sensitivity comparison? If so, why choose EA, not other psychiatric
disorders related to reproduction, such as autism?
Response: As mentioned in the introduction, previous research has robustly shown that increased
genetically predicted educational attainment is associated with fewer children and later age at first
birth. The present study applied MR in a novel context to test this evolutionary paradox, and we
herefore wanted to include a robust positive control with the same outcome dataset used for
chizophrenia analysis. Other psychiatric disorders may be the subject of future research, but would
not serve as a positive control in this context. We have tried to clarify this in the introduction.
Additionally, as there is not robust evidence for an association of genetically predicted educational
attainment on number of sexual partners, we have not included this as a positive control.
3. Page 5 (line 37-38): I wonder if the authors checked the distribution of “number of children”
phenotype (i.e are there any ‘outlier’ individuals who had a large number of children?). I am also
nterested in seeing the similarity of “number of children they had given birth to” (female-specific)
and “number of children they had fathered” (male-specific) from the true spouses (there are about
1200 known spouse pairs in UK Biobank and about 20,000 inferred spouse pairs), to check the
divorce rate which may be a confounder for MR analyses.
Response: We checked for outliers and although there were participants who reported high numbers
of children, these individuals were asked to confirm their answer by UK Biobank (females highest =
22; males highest =100). As number of children, especially for females, is probably an unlikely
measure to misreport we kept all individuals in the analysis. We have checked the genetic liability
core for schizophrenia in these individuals, and this highest individuals were in the middle range of
polygenic risk, therefore unlikely to skew results. We are unsure why the reviewer raises divorce as a
concern given that in MR, we use genetic instruments that are unlikely to be related to potential
confounders of analyses of observational data.
4. Page 5 (‘Outcome measures’ section): One suggestion is to also take reproductive failure (e.g
ever have pregnancy termination, miscarriage) into account in the analyses as a covariate,
particularly for the “childless” phenotype.
Response: It is unfortunately not possible to include a covariate in the MR design used (two-sample
MR with summary level data).
5. Page 5 (line 41): It is possible to generate a sample for age at first birth in males from
dentification of potential spouses?
Response: Although it may be possible to infer at age first birth for some men in UK Biobank, the
ample size is likely to be low and likely underpowered to conduct MR analyses. It is also possible that
heir age at first child does not refer to a child that they had with their spouse in UK Biobank.
6. Page 5 (line 54-55); Page 6 (line 7-8); Page 7 (line 11): how about fitting all the models (i.e.
GWAS, MR, the genetic score-liability regression) with both assessment centre and genotype batch
as covariates?
Response: We do present LDSC and MR analyses adjusted for genotype batch in supplementary
material. We do not predict there to be differences in data collection across centres as we are using
elf-reported outcomes, and have adjusted for the top 10 principal components to attempt to address
population stratification.
7. Page 7 (line 15): I wonder if it is possible to run MR using “number of children” or “age at first
birth” as exposure and EA as outcome, to examine the potential bi-directional association between
EA and number of children and age at first birth, depending on whether there is enough independent
genome-wide significant (p < 5e-08) or suggestive (p < 1e-05) SNPs associated with number of
children and age at first birth.
Response: Educational attainment is a positive control in this study and not the focus of our analyses.
Therefore, although interesting, we do not feel the suggested analyses is within the scope of the
current paper.
8. Table 1 (line 13); Table 2 (line 21 & 24): p-value are not written in a same format.
Response: Thank you for highlighting this. The p-values are presented in their current format as they
are below what is estimated by the analyses packages used. We therefore decided to present them as
ess than what we could observe as the minimum for the other measures.
9. Table 2 (line 14-15): The MR-Egger results for SCZ-age at first birth seems different from other
models. The intercept of MR-Egger regression was estimated differently from 0 at a significance level
of 5%, indicating the existence of pleiotropic SNP effects. If this is the case, the author should
acknowledge it as a potential limitation.
Response: Although the results may appear different from other models, we state in the table caption
hat the I2GX value is too low for MR-Egger results to be given emphasis here.
10. Page 8 (line 16): Figure 2 showed some evidence for a ‘U’ shape curve between SCZ and age at
irst birth. Since there is a study (Ni et al. 2018 Scientific Reports) published recently also utilised UKB
ample and found a ‘U’ shape relationship between age at first birth in women and SCZ, maybe it is
worth trying to divide the sample into more quantiles (i.e 7 or 9) to check the relationship?
Response: We have now added figures for all outcomes to supplementary material, using deciles for
he genetic score (Supplementary figures S1-S3). As discussed above in response to reviewer 1, we
have now included further non-linear analysis for age at first birth to further examine this
elationship.
11. Page 11 (line 47): there is a typo in reference #3.
Response: Thank you, we have now corrected this.
12. Supplementary Figures 1-3 (and description in main text): Comment. This looks like what might
be expected under stabilising selection, even if the quadratic term is not statistically significant.
Perhaps this could be lack of power? In the future (next few years), the accuracy of schizophrenia
iability prediction is going to be better so the issue can be revisited.
Response: We agree that these figures appear to show some support for a peak in fitness at
ntermediate levels of genetic liability for schizophrenia which is consistent with stabilising selection;
however, we are reluctant to overstate any findings without clear statistical evidence for number of
children. For the present study, we applied relatively novel methods to address this evolutionary
paradox, but we look forward to further research as and when these instruments and methods are
developed. We thank the reviewer for this comment, highlighting how exciting this research will
continue to be in the future.
