In this manuscript the authors, Gangan and Athale, propose that cell length variability in fast-
growing population of E. coli is coupled to the SOS response pathway through RecA. The authors
demonstrate that there is an increase in the cell length variability, when the cultures are grown in
rich LB media when compared to minimal media. Further they find that the cell length variability
increases in the presence of the DNA-synthesis inhibitor, hydroxyurea. They hypothesize (it’s not
clear why) that this may be due disturbance in the RecA function. They show that in the absence
of RecA the cell length variability increases in LB+hydroxyurea, when compared to wild-type. As
a support of their argument, they show that more RecA is recruited to DNA in fast growing cells.
Though the authors have hit upon an interesting aspect that contributes to cell length variability
in the fast growing population of E. coli, their argument and conclusion is not completely
convincing. Certain issues remain to be addressed before the study warrants a publication.
Moreover, the entire manuscript needs a thorough re-writing.
Major issues:
1. The abstract is very confusing and difficult to read. From the abstract it is not clear what
question the authors are intending to analyze, and what their conclusion is. The abstract and the
manuscript needs a major restructuring.
2. If, according to the authors, the recruitment of RecA is what contributes to cell length
variability, removal of RecA (<U+2206>recA mutant) should have less cell length variability than MG1655
when grown in rich media. But, from Fig. S2 this does not seem to be the case.
3. There seems to be an appreciable difference in cell length variability while MG1655 and <U+2206>recA
are grown in the presence of hydroxyurea. This can very well be an off-target effect of
hydroxyurea which is enhanced in the absence of RecA.
(a) What happens to cell length variability in the <U+2206>lexA or the <U+2206>sulA mutant in the presence of
hydroxyurea.
(b) Can the ectopic expression of recA bring the cell length variability of the <U+2206>recA mutant, in the
presence of hydroxyurea, to the MG1655 levels?
(c) Does the RecA-GFP localization increase in the MG1655 cells grown in LB + hydroxyurea.
4. The authors must also analyze the effect of varying concentrations of hydroxyurea in MG1655
and <U+2206>recA by microscopy or a FACS-based analysis. As the authors have already set up the
‘mother machine’ they could use this method to precisely quantify the cell length variability in
various conditions (<U+2206>recA or MG1655 in LB +/- hydroxyurea).
5. A previous study (Induction of the SOS response by hydroxyurea in Escherichia coli K12. Barbé
et al. Mutat Res. 1987 192(2): 105-8) have shown that hydroxyurea at higher concentrations above
10mM can induce the recA gene, as a result of the induction of SOS response by hydroxyurea.
Therefore, the authors should compare the viability of MG1655 and <U+2206>recA mutants in the
presence or absence of hydroxyurea. Also, it will be nice to see if it is the increase in the steady
state levels of the RecA protein, in the presence of hydroxyurea, is what contributes to the cell
length variability.
6. Does overexpression of RecA increase cell length variability?
7. In Figs. 5A and 5B, authors have quantified the number of cells with RecA-GFP that co-
localizes with the nucleoid. The images are difficult to interpret. Can the cells be imaged at a
higher magnification?
3
It may be possible that the increase in localization may be an artifact due to the stabilization of
RecA with the addition of a GFP tag. To dissect this, authors should perform immunoblot
experiments comparing wild-type RecA and RecA-GFP protein levels in LB, YEB and TB media.
This will also help to see if the RecA/RecA-GFP levels vary while grown on different nutrient
conditions.
8.In Fig S3B, can the authors explain how MG1655 cells become filamentous?
Minor issues:
9. Throughout the manuscript italicize gene name and organism name.
10. Abstract and manuscript needs spell check.
11. Page3, Line 53 : “exceeding one doubling per hour”
12. Page4, Line 11 : “light microscopy and image analysis have allowed”
13. Page7, Line 6 : please clarify “inoculated at 1% dilution ?”
14. Page12, Line 30 : confusing

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This report shows that the variability of E. coli cell lengths is increased in the fast growth rate in
the independent manner of cell cycle stages by microscopic observations. The authors also found
that stall of replication fork by addition of hydroxyurea (HU) increased the variability of cell
lengths and then the ratio of localization of RecA on chromosome correlated with the variability
of cell lengths, suggesting involvement of stochastic multifork replication and RecA recruitment
to the DNA in the increase in cell length variability with fast growth rate. This is interesting but
4
premature. I think that additional evidences will be need to support its conclusion in this
manuscript.
The major comments are the following;
(1) To confirm that the variability of E. coli cell lengths is independent of cell cycle, danC
temperature sensitive mutant, which allows synchronous replication and division of cells, must
be examined.
(2) In addition of HU examination, the effect of other inhibitors for the variability of cell lengths
must support the conclusion.
(3) Genetic complementary experiments will be need for HU-treatment effect in recA mutant.
Also localization of RecA must be observed not only in wild type but also in recA mutant.
Minor comments:
1. Text includes duplicate of an original.
2. Symbols of genes and bacteria must be italic.
3. (P 5: Lane 27) What is a pBAD24-hupA-gfp?
4. (P 11: Line29) What is TB and YEB?

This was revised with supportive results from additional experiments including trimethoprim-

and methods section, included additional result in the form of figures and
supporting material and re-written the text. In response to the comments of the
reviewers, we now provide multiple additional lines of evidence from
experimental data to support our conclusions. At the same time our conclusions
remain unchanged. We hope the revised manuscript has improved sufficiently to
make it acceptable for publication.

1. In this manuscript the authors, Gangan and Athale, propose that cell length
variability in fast-growing population of E. coli is coupled to the SOS response
pathway through RecA. The authors demonstrate that there is an increase in the
cell length variability, when the cultures are grown in rich LB media when
compared to minimal media. Further they find that the cell length variability
increases in the presence of the DNA-synthesis inhibitor, hydroxyurea. They
hypothesize (it’s not clear why) that this may be due disturbance in the RecA
function. They show that in the absence of RecA the cell length variability increases
in LB+hydroxyurea, when compared to wild-type. As a support of their argument,
they show that more RecA is recruited to DNA in fast growing cells. Though the
authors have hit upon an interesting aspect that contributes to cell length
variability in the fast growing population of E. coli, their argument and conclusion
is not completely convincing. Certain issues remain to be addressed before the
study warrants a publication. Moreover, the entire manuscript needs a thorough
re-writing.
Our response:
We are grateful to this reviewer for having taken the time to critically
read our manuscript. Based on these comments, we have re-written the
manuscript to clarify multiple aspects of the study- the hypothesis relating
growth-rate to cell lengths and it’s basis in literature, the connection to RecA and
the evidence of the effect of both the mutation and overexpression of RecA, in
presence of hydroxyurea. By performing new experiments including
immunostaining and microfluidics for continuous culture and analyzing new
data, we believe we have provided further evidence for the effect of growth rate
on cell length variability and the proposed mechanism.
Specifically, our hypothesis of the role of RecA in hydroxyurea and
growth-rate dependence of cell elongation is derived from a combination of our
own observations of E. coli with a recA1 background, which phenocopies typical
cell-septum mutants, e.g. ftsZ mutants (1). While the recA1 mutation has been
shown to result in asynchronous replication producing an odd number of
genome copies (2), E. coli deletion mutants of recA were observed to have a
higher frequency of replication fork stalling (3). Replication fork stall repair is
important for DNA replication as pointed out in a recent review by Cox et al. (4),
but it has also results in a failure of cell division leading to elongated cells in a
study that used artificial replication roadblocks to induce replication fork stalling
(5). This link between replication stalling and cell division is consistent with
previous findings linking the SOS response pathway, invoked by replication fork
stalls, to RecA mediated activation of SulA, which inhibits cell division (6). While
previous studies have related growth rate to cell size, they had not so far
involved a molecular mechanism that could regulate it. Here, by quantification of
the effect of growth rate on cell size variability, we discover a threshold effect.
The correspondence of this threshold growth rate with the Cooper and
Helmstetter’s threshold for multifork replication (7) was the basis of our
hypothesis for a mechanistic link between growth rate and cell length based on
replication stalling and cell division inhibition by a RecA. We regret the lack of
clarity and have modified the Introduction (Page 4-5) to clarify these points.
In addition, we comprehensively re-written the text- abstract, results and
discussion sections- to address the issues of clarity. By addressing the specific
issues raised by this reviewer, we provide more evidence for our conclusions.
We hope the manuscript in its revised form is now suitable for publication. Our
specific responses to the comments follow.

Major issues:
1. The abstract is very confusing and difficult to read. From the abstract it is
not clear what question the authors are intending to analyze, and what their
conclusion is. The abstract and the manuscript needs a major restructuring.
Our response: We regret the lack of clarity and have re-written the abstract. In
brief, we sought to address the question of how growth rate affects the non-
genetic population variability of cell size. In order to identify molecular
mechanisms for our observations, we test a hypothesis that the regulation of cell
division by RecA could link our observation to cell size. We find size variability
increases above a threshold growth rate and is enhanced by drugs that inhibit
DNA replication processivity. Compared to wild-type, cells mutant for recA
demonstrate higher basal cell length variability, which is further enhanced by
drugs. Additionally, the RecA protein localization on the bacterial nucleoid
increases with increasing growth rate. These multiple lines of evidence, allow us
to conclude that growth rate above a threshold does result in greater variation in
cell lengths in a population and this is in part mediated by RecA activity. The
changes are highlighted on in the revised Abstract on Page 2.
cell length variability, removal of RecA (<U+2206>recA mutant) should have less cell length
variability than MG1655 when grown in rich media. But, from Fig. S2 this does not
seem to be the case.
Our response: There are two parts to the observations of the role of RecA in cell
size variability: (a) the effect of the presence of a functional copy of the recA gene
in wild-type cells and (b) the effect of a recA deletion.
(a) We observed population cell length variability of E. coli to increase with
growth rate (Fig. 1-3) and hypothesized that increasing RecA localization on the
genome with increasing growth rate could provide a causal link. This is based on
the SOS response pathway of RecA recruitment on DNA, which triggers SulA
mediated cell division inhibition. Thus, cell length variability increases, under
conditions which increase replication stalling, triggering RecA recruitment
replication forks. One such natural condition is rapid growth.
(b) Cells that lack recA, are hampered in their ability to repair DNA replication
fork stalls (1). Accumulating stalling of replication forks results in genome
defects due to incomplete replication (2) and the inability of the cell to induce an
SOS response through LexA cleavage (3) results in cell division inhibition
potentially due to nucleoid occlusion (4). The absence of RecA is expected to
result in a larger proportion of cell division defects, and hence cell elongation
percentages are expected to be higher, as compared to wild-type.
We have compared the cell length variability of the wild-type E. coli
MG1655 on the basis of growth rates- fast vs. slow growth and show faster
growth results in greater variability. When we compare between two strains-
wild-type and <U+0394>recA - under the same physical conditions of a high growth rate
(i.e. grown in LB), we expect multiple replication forks in both. However, the
mutant cells, which lack the RecA protein, are expected to experience a higher
frequency of stalled DNA replication forks, and DNA replication that is less
processive and more often incomplete. Such defects are expected to result to
inhibit cell division through nucleoid occlusion, thus resulting in a more frequent
cell elongation, as compared to wild-type (Fig. S2). Hence, during rapid growth
<U+0394>recA mutants are expected to have greater cell length variability than wild-type.
This expectation is borne out by our results.
For a more precise quantitative comparison between the different growth
rates and mutants, a theoretical model of bacterial cell division coupled to
replication would be required.
This point has been discussed by adding a note in the Discussion section
on Page 22-23.

3. There seems to be an appreciable difference in cell length variability while
MG1655 and <U+2206>recA are grown in the presence of hydroxyurea. This can very well be
an off-target effect of hydroxyurea which is enhanced in the absence of RecA.
(a) What happens to cell length variability in the <U+2206>lexA or the <U+2206>sulA mutant in the
presence of hydroxyurea.
(b) Can the ectopic expression of recA bring the cell length variability of the <U+2206>recA
mutant, in the presence of hydroxyurea, to the MG1655 levels?
(c) Does the RecA-GFP localization increase in the MG1655 cells grown in LB +
hydroxyurea.
Our response: In order to test the specificity of the effect of hydroxyurea
treatment (Fig. 4C) and it’s relation to the proposed RecA-based mechanism, we
have performed the following tests to answer the reviewers’ questions:
(a) Multiple strains of E. coli - MG1655, <U+0394>slmA, <U+0394>sulA, <U+0394>recA, and <U+0394>recA+pRecA-
mCherry (Fig. 4C) were analyzed for the effect of growth rate and hydroxyurea
(HU) treatment on cell length variability. The <U+0394>lexA mutant was not examined,
since it is lethal to cells (personal communication, A. Sardesai), due to de-
repression of SOS response proteins which in turn inhibit cell division. The cell
length variability for increasing HU concentrations of the <U+0394>slmA mutant (the
factor responsible for nucleoid-occlusion) is similar to MG1655, while the <U+0394>sulA
mutant is less variable as compared to MG1655 (Fig. 4C). Taken together, the
result indicates that the nucleoid occlusion pathway (mediated by SlmA) on HU
treatment shows comparable cell length variability to wild-type cells, but in the
absence of the SulA protein, the effect on cell length is reduced below wild-type
levels. This indicates that our effect of HU on cell length is the result of specific
interactions, and not due to off-target effects.
(b) We have constructed two plasmids: pRecA-mCherry (Fig. S8A) and pBAD24-
recA (Fig. S8B). These plasmids express RecA proteins of expected molecular
weights (Fig. S7A) and when they were introduced in a <U+0394>recA background, the
cell length variability of the mutant cell, reverts to wild-type levels (Fig. S2B).
Additionally, <U+0394>recA cells treated with a range of hydroxyurea concentrations are
more variable than wild-type, but <U+0394>recA cells expressing the RecA-mCherry construct
have a comparable phenotype to the wild-type over the same range of hydroxyurea
(Fig. 4C), indicating ‘rescue’.
(c) The localization of RecA-GFP in E. coli MG1655 cells expressing a tagged copy
of the genomic recA was examined for co-localization with the nucleoid in
hydroxyurea treated as compared to untreated cells grown in three different
media- LB (Luria Bertani), YEB (yeast extract broth) and TB (tryptone broth).
The proportion of cells with co-localized RecA on nucleoids was higher for
treated as compared to untreated in the merged fluorescence images (Fig. 6A)
and quantification from multiple images (Fig. 6B). This provides further
evidence for our RecA recruitment hypothesis for cell length variability.
These aspects have now been also addressed in the Results section on Pages
15-17.
4. The authors must also analyze the effect of varying concentrations of
hydroxyurea in MG1655 and <U+2206>recA by microscopy or a FACS-based analysis. As the
authors have already set up the ‘mother machine’ they could use this method to
precisely quantify the cell length variability in various conditions (<U+2206>recA or
MG1655 in LB +/- hydroxyurea).
Our response: In order to address the question of the question raised by this
reviewer of the effect of hydroxyurea on cell division dynamics, we have
performed microfluidics experiments using E. coli MG1655 and <U+0394>recA strains in
the ‘mother machine’. The time-lapse images from microscopy were acquired
while a continuous flow was maintained- growth medium was initially flowed for
1 hour (‘pre-treatment’), followed by a period of growth in the presence of 30
mM hydroxyurea (HU) in LB for 1 hour (‘treatment’) and followed by growth in
LB medium (‘recovery’). While the majority of cells divide normally (birth
lengths ~2 µm), they occasionally undergo cell filamentation (cell lengths ~6
µm), as seen in individual frames from the time-series and kymography (Fig. 5A-
D). Most cells of the E. coli <U+0394>recA strain also divide normally (birth lengths ~2
µm), while a few cells reach cell lengths of ~12 µm (Fig. 5E-H). The data
corroborates our results from the bulk experiments of the probabilistic nature of
cell filamentation and greater extent of such filamentation in <U+0394>recA cells.
However it also demonstrates the utility of a potentially simpler, population
approach, to address the questions of cell length variability.
In future, we aim to automate the analysis of the cell division process at a single-
cell and sub-cellular to better understand population cell length variability.
The methods describing these new experiments have been added to the
Materials and Methods section on Pages 7-8, and our observations have been
added to the Results section on Page 16-17.
5. A previous study (Induction of the SOS response by hydroxyurea in
Escherichia coli K12. Barbé et al. Mutat Res. 1987 192(2): 105-8) have shown that
hydroxyurea at higher concentrations above 10mM can induce the recA gene, as a
result of the induction of SOS response by hydroxyurea. Therefore, the authors
should compare the viability of MG1655 and <U+2206>recA mutants in the presence or
absence of hydroxyurea. Also, it will be nice to see if it is the increase in the steady
state levels of the RecA protein, in the presence of hydroxyurea, is what contributes
to the cell length variability.
Our response: In response to the reviewer’s comment we have performed live-
cell imaging in continuous culture of both E. coli MG1655 and <U+0394>recA strains and
observed the response to 30 mM hydroxyurea (Fig. 5). We do not find any
prominent cell death in this single cell assay and can rule out changed viability as
non-specific effects. However, consistent with the results of Barbé et al. (1987),
we do observe an increase in RecA-GFP protein levels in treated as compared to
untreated cells using cellular fluorimetry (1.25 fold) (Fig. 6C) in LB, YEB and TB
(Fig. 6C, D). At the same time, we have also examined the levels of RecA protein
using an anti-RecA antiserum and find a RecA protein levels (native) are
approximately 2-3 times as abundant in hydroxyurea treated as compared to
untreated samples in LB, YEB and TB (Fig. S7A, B). Interestingly, despite this
rapidly growing cells but not during slow growth (Fig. 4C).
Additional text and figures include Western blotting described in the
Materials and Methods on Pages 8-9 and reported in Fig. S7, fluorimetry of
RecA-GFP in Fig. 6D, the ‘mother machine’ data in Fig. 5 and explanatory text in
the Results section on Pages 17-18.
6. Does overexpression of RecA increase cell length variability?
Our response: To address whether RecA overexpression affects cell length
variability we expressed RecA as a RecA-mCherry fusion protein (Fig. S8A) and
in an un-tagged form under the control of an arabinose promoter (Fig. S8B).
background to produce mCherry-tagged and untagged versions of the RecA
protein (Fig. S7A). We find E. coli MG1655 overexpressing a RecA-mCherry
fusion protein results in a lower variance and mean cell length (Fig S2A) and CVL
similar to cells without the plasmid (Fig. S2B), while the overexpression of RecA
from the pBAD24 plasmid with 0.7% arabinose (expected to increase expression
levels by orders of magnitude) resulted in a small increase in CVL as compared to
MG1655 without the plasmid (Fig. S2A, B). Expression of the untagged and
mCherry tagged constructs in an E. coli <U+0394>recA background results in a rescue of
the CVL to the levels of E. coli MG1655 (Fig. S2A, B).
This has been added as a note in the Discussion section on Page 21 and
additional figures in Fig. S2A, B.
7. In Figs. 5A and 5B, authors have quantified the number of cells with RecA-
GFP that co-localizes with the nucleoid. The images are difficult to interpret. Can
the cells be imaged at a higher magnification?
It may be possible that the increase in localization may be an artifact due to the
stabilization of RecA with the addition of a GFP tag. To dissect this, authors should
perform immunoblot experiments comparing wild-type RecA and RecA-GFP protein
levels in LB, YEB and TB media. This will also help to see if the RecA/RecA-GFP
levels vary while grown on different nutrient conditions.
Our response:
We have repeated the experiment to test co-localization of RecA and DAPI
marking the genomic DNA, and imaged the cells using a higher magnification
lens (100x lens as compared to 40x previously). Cells are imaged in DIC and two
fluorescence channels- DAPI and GFP- to visualize the nucleoid and RecA-GFP
respectively and co-localization scored based on the merge (of the two
fluorescence channels) image (Fig. 6A).
In order to address the question of whether the tag on the RecA-GFP could result
in artifacts of localization, we have compared images of cells stained with anti-
RecA antibodies and examined co-localization with DAPI stained nucleoids (Fig.
S5A). We find the percentage cells with the colocalization of RecA-GFP foci with
the DAPI signal are comparable (Fig S5B). Additionally, we also find the cell
length variability as measured by the CVL to be indistinguishable between
immuno-stained RecA cells and cells expressing RecA-GFP from the genomic
copy (Fig. S5C).
Page 18.
8. In Fig S3B, can the authors explain how MG1655 cells become filamentous?
Our response: The agar-pad based experiments with E. coli MG1655 expressing
a plasmid-based HupA-GFP protein in Fig. S3 illustrate that at single cell levels in
a wild-type population, we can observe both normal DNA replication and
segregation followed by cell division (Fig. S3A) as well as occasional rare events
of failed DNA segregation and cell filamentation (Fig. S3B). In the case of the
filamentous cell (Fig. S3B), the kymograph demonstrates the lack of separation
of nucleoids, forming a ‘smear’ throughout the cell length. This results in cell
filamentation with cell length eventually reaching ~40 µm. The data illustrates
genome segregation defects regulate cell sizes even in wild-type cells. The
overview of the field of view in Video S1 also demonstrates that most cells
undergo normal DNA segregation. We believe this data suggests one of the
mechanisms affecting cell lengths during division could be DNA replication
defects, which could be seen in incomplete DNA segregation. This mechanism
forms the basis of some of our subsequent experiments to perturb replication
processivity using hydroxyurea and mutants for RecA. Additional explanatory
text has been added to the Discussion section on Page 20.
Minor issues:
9. Throughout the manuscript italicize gene name and organism name.
Our response: Organism and gene names have now been all italicized.
10. Abstract and manuscript needs spell check.
Our response: The abstract has been completely re-written and the entire text
checked for spellings.
11. Page3, Line 53 : “exceeding one doubling per hour”
Our response: The text has been modified.
12. Page4, Line 11 : “light microscopy and image analysis have allowed”
Our response: The text has been modified.
13. Page7, Line 6 : please clarify “inoculated at 1% dilution ?”
Our response: We have included a more explicit statement of the inoculation
density so the text now reads “The cultures were diluted 1:100 (1% inoculum)
into 5 ml of fresh LB...”, and in this particular case 50 µl of overnight culture was
added to 5 ml of fresh growth medium.
14. Page12, Line 30 : confusing
Our response: The text has been modified and now reads as “When the growth

a second phase of a steeper increase.”

Our response: We regret the inconsistency. The genomic construct was RecA-
GFP with a GFP tag added C-terminally to the RecA protein. The text has been
modified to consistently read as “RecA-GFP”.

This report shows that the variability of E. coli cell lengths is increased in the fast
growth rate in the independent manner of cell cycle stages by microscopic
observations. The authors also found that stall of replication fork by addition of
hydroxyurea (HU) increased the variability of cell lengths and then the ratio of
localization of RecA on chromosome correlated with the variability of cell lengths,
suggesting involvement of stochastic multifork replication and RecA recruitment to
the DNA in the increase in cell length variability with fast growth rate. This is
interesting but premature. I think that additional evidences will be need to support
its conclusion in this manuscript.
Our response
We are grateful to this reviewer for having taken the time to critically read our
manuscript. Based on the specific comments, we have performed new
experiments with multiple strains, conditions and techniques including
microfluidics, immune-staining and Western blotting. By addressing the specific
issues raised by this reviewer- providing additional evidence for cell length
variability, the role of growth rate and the proposed mechanism- we have
collated evidence that better supports our conclusions. Additionally, we have re-
written aspects of our manuscript, while maintaining the basic conclusions. Our
specific responses to the comments are as follows.
Major comments
1. To confirm that the variability of E. coli cell lengths is independent of cell cycle,
danC temperature sensitive mutant, which allows synchronous replication and
division of cells, must be examined.
Our response: Due to the intrinsic linkage between the stringent response and
temperature and growth rate, we were hesitant to use a danC temperature
sensitive mutant to examine synchrony. Instead, we have performed additional
experiments using the ‘mother machine’ (Wang et al., 2010, Curr. Biol.) and
modulate growth rates by comparing growth in LB to M9+succinate. Cell lengths
are measured at birth (Fig. 2B, D) and the time cells divide (Fig. 2C, E), thus
achieving ’synchronization’ at the level of data analysis. We believe, this method
achieves a cell cycle ‘staging’ that is less invasive as compared to many of the
synchronization methods including the danC temperature sensitive mutant. We
find such ‘synchronized’ distributions of cell sizes show different birth length
distributions in presence of LB (Fig. 2B) as compared to M9+succinate (Fig. 2D),
a difference observed also in division length distributions (Fig. 2C, E). The
resultant CVL in LB is 0.31 (birth) and 0.32 (division) while that in M9+succinate
is 0.16 (birth) and 0.14 (division). This demonstrates an approximately two-fold
difference in variability between two growth media, independent of cell cycle
stage. Cell lengths are expected to also maximal just prior to division and
minimal at birth. All other stages are expected to fall between these two stages.
So if we were to hypothetically mix equal proportions of cells in different stages
of their cell cycle (representative of an unsynchronized culture), we would
expect those proportions of values of cell length mean and standard deviations
as a result, consistent between the ‘synchronized’ (microfluidics) estimate of
variability (Fig. 2) and the bulk unsynchronized measurements (Fig. 4, S2).
A note to the effect has been added to the Results section on Page 13.
2. In addition of HU examination, the effect of other inhibitors for the
variability of cell lengths must support the conclusion.
Our response: Based on this suggestion, we have tested the effect of
trimethoprim, known to induce replication fork stalling by thymidine pool
depletion (Slager et al. 2004 Cell). We find a similar effect on cell length
variability. Cells grown in LB and M9+succinate treated with 1 µg/ml
trimethoprim, have a higher coefficient of variation of cell lengths (CVL) as
compared to untreated (Fig. 4D). This supports our interpretation of the role of
replication fork stalling in increasing cell length variation, independent of the
drug used.
A note has been added to the Results section on Page 16 and data added to Fig.
4D.
3. Genetic complementary experiments will be need for HU-treatment effect in
recA mutant. Also localization of RecA must be observed not only in wild type but
also in recA mutant.
Our response: We have constructed plasmids to express the recA gene as a
fluorescently tagged RecA-mCherry protein (Fig. S8A) and untagged protein
under the control of an arabinose inducible promoter (Fig. S8B). The cell length
variability of the E. coli <U+0394>recA strain expressing RecA-mCherry is comparable to
the wild-type, while that of the same strain with the pBAD24 expressing plasmid
induced with 0.7% arabinose is slightly higher than wild-type (Fig. S2A, B).
Additionally we find the increase in cell length variability (CVL) of the <U+0394>recA
strain with increasing hydroxyurea treatment was reversed when the pRecA-
mCherry construct was introduced into the cells (Fig. 4C). The localization of
RecA-mCherry in the <U+0394>recA background, shows a comparable percentage of cells
with RecA puncta localized on the nucleoid (Fig. S7). Thus, we have
demonstrated the rescue of the cell length variability phenotype with both the
tagged and un-tagged constructs, demonstrating the specificity of the effect.
We have also imaged and analyzed the localization of the RecA-mCherry
fusion expressed in the wild-type background (Fig. S5A) and find the proportion
of cells with a RecA co-localized to the nucleoid match the values reported for
the genomic copy of recA-GFP expression (Fig. S5B).
Text has been added to the Results section on Pages 16 and 18 and
Discussion section on Page 22. Figures Fig. S5 and S6 have also been added.
Minor comments:
1. Text includes duplicate of an original.
Our response: We have corrected for duplicate text.
2. Symbols of genes and bacteria must be italic.
3. (P 5: Line 27) What is a pBAD24-hupA-gfp?
Our response: The dynamics of the bacterial nucleoid (DNA) segregation was
followed in fluorescence microscopy by expressing a GFP tagged nucleoid-
localized protein HupA. This has been previously reported (Wery et al. 2001,
Biochimie) to be a reliable marker for DNA during live-imaging. We have added
an explanatory note to the Materials and Methods section under Bacterial
strains and plasmids on Page 5.
4. (P 11: Line29) What is TB and YEB?
Our response: Yeast extract broth (YEB) consisted of 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract
in 1% (w/v) solutions of NaCl. Tryptone broth (TB) consisted of 1% (w/v)
tryptone in a 1% (w/v) solution of NaCl. The Materials and Methods section on
Page 6 and the Results Section Page 14 have been modified to reflect these
explanations.
5. (P 26: Fig. 3) B was used twice.Editor’s comments
Our response: The figure labels of Fig. 3 have been corrected.

comments and revise your manuscript. 
Our response: 
We are delighted to hear of the decision on our manuscript and grateful to the 
editors and reviewers for their constructive comments, which we believe has 
gone a long way in improving the manuscript. Based on the specific suggestions 
of the referees, we have modified one figure in the main text and two supporting 
figures. We have updated the text to reflect the changes. We hope the revised 
manuscript is now acceptable for publication. 
2. When submitting your revised manuscript, you must respond to the
comments made by the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 
6 -­-- File Upload". Please use this to document how you have responded to the 
comments, and the adjustments you have made. In order to expedite the processing 
of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response. 
Our response: 
We have prepared this file in the format required as “Response to Referees” 
pointing out the specific changes made, to address the comments of the referees. 
Additionally, in the revised manuscript, we have marked the changes in red. 
1. The authors have done a decent work with the revision. The current version looks
a lot better than the initial one. This version may be accepted for publication after 
addressing the concerns listed below. 
Our response: 
We are grateful to this reviewer for having taken the time to critically read our 
manuscript and have addressed the specific concerns. 
2. Issues:
Are the RecA complementation experiments in Fig. S2 done in the presence of HU? 
If not, it needs to be performed in the presence of HU for more clarity. 
Our response: 
The complementation of the <U+2206>recA strain had been performed in the presence of 
and the absence of hydroxyurea as is shown in Figure 4C. However, in order to 
address this question more closely, the frequency distribution data has now been 
added to the manuscript as a new Supplementary Figure S3. Consistent with 
our findings, we find the spread of the cell length distribution of the E. coli <U+2206>recA 
strain with 30 mM hydroxyurea treatment is restored to a level comparable to 
that of the untreated MG1655 strain (Figure S3A). This is further emphasized in 
the CV estimate for the strains (Figure S3B). This result is now part of the 
Discussion section on Page 24. 
3. In Fig. 4D also include the data from HU treatment for a better comparison to
the treatment with TM. 
Our response: 
We have now included the CV values of cells after HU treatment, to compare to 
untreated with TM in the revised Fig. 4D. 
4. The immunoblot in Fig. S7A requires a loading control. Also, indicate RecA on the
figure. 
Our response: 
The loading control has been added for Fig. S7A (renumbered to Fig. S8A) and 
shows an average band intensity of 3 non-­--specific bands (Fig. S8C) is 
comparable between the pairs of HU treated and untreated samples in LB, YEB 
and TB (Fig. S8D). Additionally, the position of untagged as well as GFP and 
mCherry tagged RecA proteins have been clearly indicated in the blot in Fig. S8A 
(formerly referred to as S7A). The Results section on Page 20 and Fig. S8 have 
been modified. 
5. In Fig. S7A, B does the protein levels of RecA-­--GFP/RecA-­--mCherry/RecA (from
pBAD24-­--recA) change in the response to HU treatment. 
Our response: 
treatment, we have immunostained the cells expressing RecA-­--GFP from the 
genomic promoter (Fig. S8E). We find the band intensity of the GFP tagged 
protein expressed from the native promoter increases by approximately 2.5 fold 
(Fig. S8F). A loading control using the average of three non-­--specific band 
intensities (Fig. S8G) demonstrates a comparable protein levels were loaded 
(Fig. S8H). This overexpression was not examined in cells expressing RecA-­--
mCherry or RecA from pBAD24 since these are exogeneous plasmid based over-­--
expression systems expressed under lactose and arabinose inducible promoters 
respectively. Analyzing their expression levels in response to HU treatment 
would not convey much, and these experiments were not performed. 
Supplementary Figure S8 and the Results on Page 20 have been modified to 
reflect these changes. 
1. This was revised with supportive results from additional experiments including
trimethoprim-­--effect and recA-­--genetic complementary analyses. On the other hand, 
dnaC mutant experiment suggested by me have not been done. Instead, the authors 
have improved the text to focus the correlation between a growth rate and a 
variability on cell length distributions. I agree on such responses. 
Our response: 
We are grateful to the reviewer for having taken the time to go through our 
modifications to the original submission and for the decision.
