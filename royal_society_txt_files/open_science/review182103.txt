This manuscript investigates the relationship between social capital and corruption risk at the
level of a settlement, making a contribution to the larger corruption literature. It was in pretty
good shape when I first read it for Interface; it is in excellent shape now. The authors assiduously
addressed my comments, from the smallest recommendations of a particular citation to the
largest requests for clarification and robusticity checks. I especially appreciated their inclusion of
Supplementary Figure 6, visually illustrating the logic between their cut-off point for iWiW users
with many connections, and their re-runs of the models (1) excluding one term that led to a
borderline VIF and (2) excluding users above different numbers of connections inspired by
Dunbar's work. I made the smallest of punctuation and wording recommendations in the
attached file (Appendix A). With those punctuation and wording changes made, I recommend
this piece for publication.

6 We write to submit our article Social capital predicts corruption risk in towns for
7 publication in Royal Society: Open Science. We were invited to transfer a revised version of
8 our manuscript originally submitted to Royal Society: Interface (id: rsif-2018-0762). We first
9
wish to acknowledge the editor and reviewers of our paper for their helpful comments and
10
11 the invitation to transfer the submission to your journal. The updated version of our paper
12 addresses all points made by the two reviewers and the editor concerning our earlier
13 submission.
14
15
16 The attached memo describes these changes in detail. For the sake of readability, we
17 assign progressive code numbers to comments. We discuss the comment and suggest how
18 we address the issue in the paper, quoting directly from the revised text when appropriate.
19
20
The most significant changes are:
21
22 1. We give a careful rewording of our claims and discussion to avoid
23 misinterpretation related to causality in our findings.
24 2. Thanks to references suggested by Reviewer 1, we have improved our
25 review of the literature and made modifications to our framing.
26
27
3. We have improved clarity, especially we explain why we use a snapshot
28 of the social network data and why we aggregate our contract corruption
29 risk scores.
30 4. We carried out robustness checks against thresholds we used to filter our
31
data, finding that our results remain intact. We note these alternative
32
33 specifications in the text and include additional tables and figures in the
34 SI.
35
36 We believe that our manuscript has considerably improved and hope that it is now
37
38
publishable in your journal. We look forward to hearing from you in due course.

11 We wish to thank Reviewer 1 for her/his positive opinion about our paper and the detailed
12 suggestions for improvement of the text. We have addressed all minor points in the
13 marked-up copy of our manuscript. Among several useful references, we are especially
14 grateful for calling our attention to the text by Yamagichi, which led us to a significant
15
16 improvement in our theoretical framing. Though we addressed comments through, the
17 most significant changes are in the introduction.

R1C2:- The choices of exclusion criteria are not sufficiently motivated. Excluding towns with
21
22 fewer than 5 contracts issued during the study period is likely to bias against small towns;
23 per the authors' point in the Discussion that towns with fewer contracts may be especially
24 likely to fill contracts in a corrupt manner, given lack of a smooth-running system for
25 assessment, the inclusion of these towns should only amplify their effect. Likewise, the
26
27
exclusion of participants with more than 10,000 connections should be better motivated, as
28 the cut-off seems arbitrary and may bias against users from big towns. In short, I worry that
29 both ends of the distribution have been truncated due to these decisions, so more motivation
30 is needed to assure the reader that these decisions are justified -- or these data should be
31
included in the dataset and the results re-run. Clearer justifications are also needed for the
32
33 exclusion of Budapest and the use of average income (as opposed to Gini or median income).
34
35 We acknowledge that in the original manuscript the chosen cutoffs were poorly motivated
36 and the choice of control variables deserved more detail and thank the reviewer for
37
38
pointing these out. We address the points in order:
39
40 1. We removed towns with fewer than five contracts per year for three reasons.
41 a. The first is that our corruption risk indicators are noisy measures of potential
42
bad behavior. When aggregated over many contracts, the signal becomes
43
44 clear (i.e. 80% closed procedure or single bidding vs 20%).
45 b. The second is that in addition to the stylized fact that corruption may be
46 easier in small towns (given the lower stakes, lower quality of oversight),
47 other factors may impact our red flag indicators in this setting. Smaller
48
49
settlements may be served by fewer firms (which may increase the likelihood
50 of single bidding). Towns issuing few contracts have less practice in the
51 procedures and may make mistakes (i.e. waiting until the last moment,
52 requiring a short notice period and attracting a single bidder).
53
54
55 To test the robustness of our findings to this threshold, we rerun our analysis
56 twice, including all settlements with at least 1, respectively at least 2,
57 contracts per year. We find that the main findings (fragmentation is
58 positively and diversity negatively related to settlement level corruption risk
59
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 3 of 31 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 indicators) of our models are preserved when including these settlements,
4
5 we report these model tables in the appendix.
6
7 2. We removed users with over 10,000 connections because we are interested in
8 quantifying social connections between individuals. Reviewer 2 would have
9
preferred a significantly lower threshold, suggesting that it is unlikely that any
10
11 individual can have more than 10,000 genuine connections with other people. As we
12 argue in the revised text (in subsection: Measuring social capital): this cutoff
13 balances two concerns: it excludes those accounts with so many connections that it
14 brings into question the nature of its connections, and we avoid truncating the tail of
15
16 the distribution of social connectivity too much, allowing for sociality to range over
17 several orders of magnitude. We also cite a paper on detecting fake accounts on
18 social media which finds that high node degree is a particularly useful filter. We also
19 note that we take the same approach as Lengyel et al (2015). We have included a
20
short discussion about the filtering to make our position clear. We added a test of
21
22 our choice of threshold to the appendix, finding that both fragmentation and
23 diversity of towns are not significantly changed (i.e. within 5% of the measures used
24 in the paper) when excluding users with more than 500, 1,000, 2,000, or 10,000
25 connections.
26
27
28 3. We improved our explanation for why we excluded Budapest, noting the difference
29 in political organization. Quoting from the revision (in subsection Local Government
30 Contracting Data): We exclude Budapest for two reasons: it is a severe outlier in size
31
and economic importance and because of its unique governance structure. Budapest
32
33 is split into 23 districts, each with its own local government and mayor. It also has a
34 city-wide government and mayor. As iWiW does not distinguish between districts and
35 that many contracting decisions are taken at the district level, we judged that we
36 could not reasonably compare the full city with other settlements in Hungary.
37
38
39 R1C3: It is unclear why the authors chose to average across years both for contracts and for
40 iWiW data. In the Discussion, they mention that they cannot discern whether corruption
41 drives social network structure or vice versa with these data, but it seems to me that they
42
can. Since data are available for both iWiW and contracts across about a decade, the
43
44 authors could analyze the contract values by year for each town, including a random effect
45 for town, and assess whether lag -1 or lag +1 values for social structure predict the contract
46 data. This may not be possible, however, due to the coverage of their data -- and this
47 coverage needs to be made more clear in the manuscript, regardless of whether the authors
48
49
choose to change their models or not. It was unclear whether iWiW data came from all years
50 or not, and what year control data come from (except for margin of victory in mayoral
51 eletions, which is clearly stated). I can imagine some cause for concern, for example, if
52 unemployment rate data come from 2013 but the majority of contracts represented in a
53
town's average were awarded in 2007. The authors need to convince the readers that the
54
55 same years are covered, and if they are not, that this non-overlapping coverage is not cause
56 for concern.
57
58 These points were very helpful and we hope that resolving them improved the clarity of the
59
60
paper. Our primary limitation in this regard is the iWiW data and particularly two of its
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 4 of 31
1
2
3 properties: first that the site was growing almost continuously until the start of its demise in
4
5 2012, with new users joining; second that links do not encode activity (unlike connections in
6 mobile phone data). Because new users are joining, it is difficult to tell if a settlement’s
7 network is changing qualitatively (becoming more diverse or fragmented) when new
8 connections are made, or if it is just an improvement in the accuracy of the picture because
9
an old friendship is now represented in the data.
10
11
12 More generally, we are trying to make a claim about a long-run phenomenon, motivated by
13 the observation that corruption risk in clustered across time and in space. Even if a town
14 becomes more diverse or fragmented, we would expect a significant lag before the quality
15
16 of governance was improved. Finally, we made sure to document the precise years for
17 which we have control data.
18
19 R1C4: Some clarity is needed with terminology, including identifying which words are used
20
interchangeably (e.g., community and group are the same, and settlement and town are the
21
22 same...?) and words that are discipline-specific (e.g., what is a bubble?).
23
24 This is again a useful comment. We have edited the manuscript to use only settlement (no
25 town, municipality, city, etc) and community (only for algorithmically detected groups of
26
27
nodes within the iWiW network). We have included a sentence clarifying this point in the
28 text. We have also revised the sentence about the asset bubble.
29
30 R1C5: More clarity is needed in the variable descriptions in Table 1 and the SI. Some of the
31
criteria for variables (e.g., above average word length of calls for contract bids) are unclear
32
33 and seem potentially ad hoc without more justification.
34
35 In the interest of space and flow of the manuscript we have supplemented our discussion of
36 the features in the supplementary materials. Nevertheless, we do acknowledge that we are
37
38
significantly leaning on past work using these measures, for instance considering above
39 average participation requirement text length as a red flag (rather than 1 or 2 standard
40 deviations above average) is indeed a choice, following the approach of Fazekas and Kocsis
41 (2017), who find a significant signal using this threshold.

Ref2Comment1: The evidences provided do not support the proposed hypotheses H1 and
50 H2. In fact, it is quite possible, and plausible, that the presence of corruption lead to more
51 fragmentation and less diversity (tribalism). At best, the evidences provided establish
52 correlation. Authors very briefly point out to this limitation in the discussion, as they conquer
53
that no causal link was established by the provided evidence. Yet, the hypothesis H1 implies
54
55 causal link, through the word "enables". The same is true for H2 through the word
56 "suppresses". While this does not null the value, not the importance, of the work and effort
57 provided in this paper, I think it is important to reword the hypotheses to avoid any causal
58 claim (unless authors can find some instrumental variable that help establish the causality).

3 We are grateful to the referee for pointing this out and we acknowledge that in our original
4
5 draft our claims seem to imply a causal relationship. We have significantly rewritten the
6 relevant parts of the text to avoid this implication.
7
8 R2C2: In the supplementary material, authors explain that they omit users with more than
9
10,000 connection, since these are hardly social ties. Why particularly 10,000? I can
10
11 confidently say that no one would remember the names of 1000 people at the same time!
12 This part needs at least some evidence of the literature.
13
14 First we would like to acknowledge that the reviewer makes a good point: no one can have
15
16 10,000 friends, let alone 1,000 (consider Dunbar). On the other hand we note that Reviewer
17 1 suggested that we are cutting off interesting users in the long tail which may have an
18 interesting effect on the structural estimates. Such users may also provide a way for friends
19 to meet online (for example if both of us are friends with such a super user, we may be
20
more likely to encounter each other’s’ profiles). Please consider our response to Reviewer 1
21
22 (R1C2) and the following addition to the text: this cutoff balances two concerns: it excludes
23 those accounts with so many connections that it brings into question the nature of its
24 connections, and we avoid truncating the tail of the distribution of social connectivity too
25 much, allowing for sociality to range over several orders of magnitude.
26
27
28 We also carried out a robustness test, comparing the fragmentation and diversity of
29 settlements as the cutoff ranges across the values: 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 10000. We
30 find that the measures in the paper (i.e. with a cutoff at 10,000) are within 5% of alternative
31
choices of the threshold at or above 500 connections. We report these findings in the
32
33 supplementary information.
34
35
36 R2C3: How can readers access the data to verify the analysis done in the paper? This is
37
38
important, but was not clear. A related point is the privacy of the data. When describing the
39 use of social network data, authors (correctly) raised the issue of user privacy. However, no
40 details were provided in the supplementary material (how was the data protected and
41 privacy insured). This is particularly important if the data is to be made public.
42
43
44 We thank Reviewer 2 for reminding us of the importance of this aspect of our work. We
45 obtained access to the social network data through agreement with the owner on condition
46 of signing an NDA. We received the data with names removed and replaced with
47 anonymous IDs. Moreover, the terms of the NDA do not allow us to share individual level
48
49
data, hence we share only town-level aggregate features from the social network
50 (fragmentation, diversity, user rate). We have update the data availability statement to be
51 more clear, and note that we included settlement-level data in our original submission.

23 Abstract
24
Corruption is a social plague: gains accrue to small groups, while its costs are borne by
25
everyone. Significant variation in its level between and within countries suggests a relationship
26 between social structure and the prevalence of corruption, yet, large scale empirical studies thereof
27 have been missing due to lack of data. In this paper we relate the structural characteristics of
28 social capital of settlements with corruption in their local governments. Using datasets from
29 Hungary, we quantify corruption risk by suppressed competition and lack of transparency in the
30 settlement’s awarded public contracts. We characterize social capital using social network data
31 from a popular online platform. Controlling for social, economic, and political factors, we find
32 that settlements with fragmented social networks, indicating an excess of bonding social capital
33 have higher corruption risk and settlements with more diverse external connectivity, suggesting
34 a surplus of bridging social capital are less exposed to corruption. We interpret fragmentation as
fostering in-group favoritism and conformity, which increase corruption, while diversity facilitates
35
impartiality in public life and stifles corruption.

38 Introduction
39
40 Corruption is widely recognized to affect adversely social and economic outcomes of societies [43],
41 yet it is difficult to fight [44]. Though education and income seem to decrease corruption [28], it
42 persists even under highly developed, democratic conditions, however, showing significant regional
43 differences [12]. Researchers often relate corruption to social aspects of society such as segregation [2],
44 interpersonal trust [59], civic-mindedness [30], and community engagement [56]. These approaches
45 build on the insight that corruption is a collective outcome of a community shaped by the interactions
46 among individuals [51], suggesting that differences in social capital, especially in the network structure,
47 may help explain the persistence of corruption and the observed differences in its levels.
48 The concept of social capital or the ”connections among individuals social networks and the norms
49 of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them” [56] is usually applied to understand behavior
50 of individuals [53]. Yet city or country-level aggregations have also proven useful [56], for example
51 in studying economic development and prosperity [69]. As a communal quantity, social capital is a
52 sort of public good embedded in a social network [39] of a settlement. Given the aforementioned
53 relationship between corruption and social capital, it is therefore, as suggested above, natural to
54 expect that the structure of social capital at the settlement level has considerable impact on the scale
55 of corruption in that community. Despite significant interest in the network aspects of corruption [26]

and recent experimental evidence that corruption has collaborative roots [68], less is known about
5
how the patterns of connectivity of a whole society influences the general level of corruption in its
6
government.
7
Previous studies of relating social capital and corruption [32, 5] have been constrained by two
8
empirical challenges: the difficulty of measuring corruption and the lack of data on network structure
9
at the settlement level. Corruption is one of the most hidden type of crimes therefore it is difficult to
10
estimate its extent in general, even with significant local information. For example, an audit study
11
of corruption in rural Indonesia road construction finds that villager perceptions of corruption are
12
significantly distorted by factors such as ethnic diversity compared to objective measures of corrup-
13
tion [49].
14
Many studies measure corruption using national or regional surveys [44] and suffer from the sub-
15
jectivity of corruption perceptions [65]. Other studies use data on the frequency of investigations and
16
convictions of politicians [28], in which a source of bias may be that in places where corruption is
17
prevalent the judiciary is more likely to be corrupt itself [33]. Recent efforts to clean and standardize
18 large datasets on public procurement [20] have been very helpful in this context as their study can
19 lead to new, more objective indicators of corruption risk.
20 In the absence of direct network data, researchers often quantify social capital using proxies such
21 as rates of voting, donating blood, and volunteering [30]. As these rates are themselves related
22 to the underlying social networks, they indicate the relevance of social capital and trust instead of
23 explaining the causes of corruption in terms of network structure. Mapping out the social capital at
24 the level of settlements using traditional tools is a formidable task. Fortunately, recent developments
25 in information-communication technologies and their increasing popularity present large data sets
26 containing relevant information. For example, data from online social networks and cellphone records
27 have been used to relate connectivity and socio-economic outcomes [17, 7, 42, 46, 4].
28 In this paper we propose to characterize the level of corruption risk in settlements in terms of
29 their social capital using two sources of micro-level data from Hungary. We quantify the structural
30 characteristics of settlements’ social capital using complete data from “iWiW”, a now defunct online
31 social network once used by approximately 40% of the adult Hungarian population [37]. We measure
32 corruption risk using administrative data on public procurement contracts over a period of eight
33 years [22].
34 Public procurement contracts constitute a major channel of public funds to private hands and are
35 highly vulnerable to corruption [20]. Recently, a set of corruption risk indicators have been derived
36 from public contract data, for example, counting how often contracts attract only a single bidder.
37 Averaged to the regional or national levels, these contract-based corruption risk measures have been
38 shown to correlate with corruption perception surveys [20], quality of government indicators [13],
39 and higher cost outcomes for internationally comparable goods such as CAT machines [21]. In the
40 Hungarian case, we find that settlements involved in a recent corruption scandal [19] have significantly
41 higher corruption risk in their contracts.
42 Putnam distinguishes between two structural categories of social capital: bonding and bridging
43 social capital [56], and we expect that these have different impacts on corruption risk. Bonding social
44 capital is based on the phenomenon of closure in a social network, describing the extent to which people
45 form dense, homogeneous communities. Such communities have benefits: members share high levels of
46 trust and can count on each other in times of crisis. They can also be confident that members who defy
47 the norms of the community will be censured [25]. The homogeneity of such tight-knit communities is
48 often based on ethnicity, religion, or class [14], indicating possible drawbacks to bonding social capital:
49 homogeneity facilitates conformity and implies exclusion of outsiders [54]. Solidarity can reach the
50 extent that insiders will protect each other even if norms from a wider context are broken, in some cases
51 even if crimes are committed. Sophisticated criminal organizations like the Mafia, members of which
52 may regularly be faced with great incentives to “flip”, rely on bonding rituals, ethnic homogeneity,
53 and family ties to enforce solidarity and in-group trust [18, 26]. The negative effects of excessive
54 bonding social capital on society are not limited to crime and corruption. Entrepreneurs embedded in

dense networks are disadvantaged because of pressure to employ under-qualified relatives [27], while
5
ethnically homogeneous groups of traders are more likely to overprice financial assets held by their
6
co-ethnics, causing financial bubbles to form [38].
7
Bridging social capital, on the other hand, refers to the connections between people from different
8
social groups. Such ties are valuable for their ability to convey novel information [29] and exposure to
9
diverse perspectives, though they do not serve as reliable sources of support in hard times. Previous
10
work shows, for instance, that immigrants in the Netherlands with bridging connections outside their
11
ethnic group have significantly higher incomes and employment rates [35]. But bridging social capital
12
is not only thought to be useful for the resources it allocates. Using an agent-based model, Macy
13
and Skvoretz showed how trust emerged among densely connected neighbors and diffused in a social
14
network via weak ties [41], implying that low bridging social capital restricted trust to within-group
15
interactions. Indeed, empirical evidence showed that ethnic groups in diverse communities with more
16
bridging social capital evaluate each other more positively [36].
17
The two concepts of bonding and bridging social capital exist in tension with each other. They
18 reflect, to quote Portes, “Durkheim’s distinction between mechanical solidarity, based on social ho-
19 mogeneity and tight personal bonds, and organic solidarity, based on role differentiation, impersonal
20 norms, and an extensive division of labor.” [55]. A settlement in which mutual cooperation relies ex-
21 cessively on mechanical solidarity will tend towards norms of in-group favoritism or particularism [44].
22 Individuals in such a society will tend to make choices, for example in the allocation of public resources,
23 distinguishing between insiders and outsiders based on a feeling of security rather than trust [71]. In
24 contrast, when cooperation is built on impersonality general trust facilitates impartial outcomes.
25 We therefore pose two hypotheses relating bonding and bridging social capital to local corruption
26 risk. The first (H1) is that excess bonding social capital, indicating the potential presence of norms
27 of in-group favoritism in a settlement is correlated with higher corruption risk in its government. The
28 second (H2) is that a high level of bridging capital, including connections to other settlements, is
29 correlated with lower levels of corruption risk because it fosters impersonal and universalistic norms.
30 Where mechanical solidarity or bonding social capital dominate organic solidarity or bridging social
31 capital, universalistic norms under which public markets are thought to function best are unsustain-
32 able. These hypotheses suggest why corruption is so difficult to fight: it is embedded in the social
33 network of a place.
34 Previous work using survey data is in accord with our hypotheses. Harris finds a significant positive
35 relationship between excess bonding social capital, measured using surveys, and corruption across over
36 200 countries [32]. In a comparative study of the 50 US states, Knack finds that residents in states
37 with higher census response and volunteering rate their governments’ performances more highly [34].
38 He finds no such effect for rates of membership in social clubs, a more exclusive form of socialization
39 than volunteering. Paccagnella and Sestito find that in regions with high electoral turnout and blood
40 donation rates, Italian schoolchildren cheat less frequently on standardized tests. In schools with
41 greater ethnic homogeneity and with hometown teachers, cheating is more frequent [50]. These case
42 studies and indirect evidences give some support the above hypotheses, however, there is need for
43 studies based on more direct data at multiple levels.
44 We find significant evidence for our hypotheses using multivariate regression models to relate
45 corruption risk and structural aspects of social capital. Hungarian settlements with fragmented social
46 networks, which we interpret as evidence of excess bonding social capital, have higher corruption risk
47 in their public procurement contracts. On the other hand, if the typical resident of a settlement
48 has more diverse connections, especially over the boundaries of their own settlements, then local
49 corruption risk is lower. These results hold controlling for several potential confounders including
50 economic prosperity, education, demographics, and political competitiveness.

Empirical Setting and Methods
6
Public contracting
7
8 In OECD economies procurement typically accounts for between 10 to 20% of GDP [48] covering
9 everything from school lunches to hospital beds and highway construction. The complexity of the
10 contracts and the relative inelasticity of the government’s demand for goods make them a prime
11 target for corruption [57].
12 Contracts are supposed to be awarded using impartial market mechanisms [67]: open and fair
13 competition for a contract is considered the best way to ensure that the government makes purchases
14 of good quality at the lowest cost. Usually, an issuer of a contract publishes a call for bids from
15 the private sector, setting a deadline for submissions leaving enough time for broad participation.
16 Companies submit sealed offers, including a price. The company offering to provide the good or
17 service for the lowest price, meeting the standards set in the call for bids, wins the contract.
18
19 Measuring settlement corruption risk in contracting
20
21 Corruption in public contracting typically involves the restriction of competition. If corrupt bu-
22 reaucrats wish to award a contract to a favored firm, they must somehow exclude other firms from
23 participating in the competition for the contract. We quantify this phenomenon at the contract level
24 by tracking the presence of elementary corruption indicators, signals we can extract from metadata
25 suggesting that competition may have been curbed [20]. These quantitative indicators [22], deduced
26 from qualitative work on corruption in public contracting, are the fingerprints of techniques used
27 to steer contracts towards preferred firms. We consider eight such elementary indicators, defined in
28 Table 1.
29 From these eight elementary indicators we define two measures of contract corruption risk:
30 Closed procedure or single bidding (Ccsb ): Did the contract attract only a single bid or was the
31 contract awarded by some procedure besides an open call for bids, for example by direct negotiation
32 with a firm or by an invitation-only auction? In terms of the indicators defined above:
33
Ccsb = max(Csinglebid , Cclosedproc )
34
35 Corruption Risk Index (CRI): Following [22], we average all eight elementary indicators defined
36 in Table 1 for each contract:
37
38 1
CRI = (Csinglebid + Cclosedproc + Cnocall + Celigcrit + Cbidtime + Cnonprice + Ccallmod + Cdecidetime )
39 8
40 These indicator-based measures of corruption risk have been related to traditional measures of
41 corruption at the regional and national levels. Among EU countries, similar indicators are correlated
42 (<U+03C1> ˜ .5) with both the World Bank’s Control of Corruption rankings and Transparency International’s
43 Corruption Perceptions Index [20]. We propose that our indicators supplement these perception-based
44 measures with more objective data at a micro-scale.
45 Our indicators also predict cost overruns and price inflation in European infrastructure projects [21].
46 At the micro-level, public bodies issuing high corruption risk contracts are significantly more likely
47 to award contracts to new companies after a change in government [23]. Finally, evidence from the
48 US suggests that firms making campaign contributions are awarded contracts with higher corruption
49 risk [24].
50
51 Local Government Contracting Data
52
53 We examine 20,524 municipal government contracts from the period of 2006-2014 issued by Hungarian
54 settlements awarding at least five contracts a year on average. We exclude towns issuing fewer contracts
55 because we are interested in systematic patterns of corruption over a sustained period of time. Our

35
36 indicators applied to individual contracts are only noisy measures of corruption - it is rather the
37 consistent observation of red flags in contracting over time that suggests that a town has a significant
38 problem with persistent corruption risk. Our results are robust to including towns issuing at least one
39 contract per year on average, reported in the SI Table 7.
40 Our goal is to quantify the overall level of corruption risk in a settlement over the full period for
41 which we have data. We create two such scores by averaging the risk indicators defined above over
42 all contracts issued by the settlement. We arrive at two measures of settlement corruption risk: the
43 rate at which a settlement issued closed-procedure or single bid contracts (Ccsb ), and the average
44 Corruption Risk Index (CRI) score of its contracts.
45 There are 169 settlements in Hungary meeting the minimum contracting criterion, excluding Bu-
46 dapest. We exclude Budapest for two reasons: it is a severe outlier in size and economic importance
47 and because of its unique governance structure. Budapest is split into 23 districts, each with its own
48 local government and mayor. It also has a city-wide government and mayor. As iWiW does not
49 distinguish between districts and that many contracting decisions are taken at the district level, we
50 judged that we could not reasonably compare the full city with other settlements in Hungary.
51 We plot the distributions of the settlement corruption risk scores in Figure 1. We note that there
52 is substantial variation across settlements: some award over 90% of their contracts either via a closed
53 procedure or to a single bidding supplier, while others do so less than 25% of the time.
54 As a test of the validity of our settlement-level measures of corruption risk, we check them against

25 a near-ground truth case of corruption. In 2018, OLAF, the European anti-fraud agency reported that
26 35 Hungarian local government public lighting contracts awarded between 2010 and 2014 contained
27 “serious irregularities” [19, 47]. Elios, the company winning these contracts, was owned at that time
28 by the son-in-law of the Hungarian Prime Minister. The contracts are considered to be overpriced and
29 the Hungarian government was appealed for initiating an investigation, which has already started.
30 These cases provide a useful test of our corruption risk indicators. There is compelling evidence
31 that settlements implicated in the scandal have, at least once, rigged a public procurement contract
32 to favor a connected firm. We compare the average corruption risk indicators of the 35 settlements
33 that awarded lighting contracts to Elios in the period in question with all other settlements in our
34 sample in Figure 2. Using a Mann-Whitney U-test, we find that settlements involved in the scandal
35 have significantly higher rates of corruption risk according to both measures (64% vs 58% Ccsb rate,
36 U = 1385, p=.033; .30 vs .28 average CRI, U = 1397, p=.037).
37
38 Measuring social capital
39
40 iWiW was popular online social network operating in Hungary from 2004 to 2013. At its peak it
41 boasted over 3.5 million active users (out of a population of around 10 million) and was among the
42 top 3 most visited sites in the country. After a period of sustained popularity, it finally collapsed in
43 2013 as competitors, including Facebook, conquered the market. The increasing tendency of users
44 to leave led to cascades in the social network, highlighting the networked nature of the site [63, 40].
45 Geographic proximity is a major positive predictor of the likelihood of friendship ties on iWiW,
46 and connections between settlements reflect historical administrative boundaries and geographical
47 barriers [37].
48 The iWiW network consists of users as nodes and mutually acknowledged friendship ties between
49 users as links. Data from iWiW includes information on each user’s settlement, selected from a menu.
50 We used an anonymized version of the data to insure privacy. We consider all nodes and links in
51 the network present at the end of 2012, during the peak of its use and before the most significant
52 period of turnover on the site leading to its collapse to define our measures of bonding and bridging
53 social capital. We consider this aggregate network rather than an evolving network from year to year
54 because we do not have in our data (in contrast with the repeated links that can be observed in
55 cellular phone call data) and because we are interested in a long-run characterization of the social

27 network structure of settlements. We describe steps we took to clean the data and the distribution of
28 use rates at the settlement level in the SI.
29 Despite valid concerns about the representativity of data taken from online social networks [64],
30 studies indicate data from online social networks offer a useful picture of the social capital of their
31 users [70, 9]. As adoption of online social networks increases, they become increasingly useful for the
32 study of the social structures [16]. In any case, we control for possible confounding factors including
33 settlement average income, rate of iWiW use, and share of the population over 60 in our models.
34
35 Fragmentation
36
37 Our first settlement-level network measure, fragmentation, quantifies the extent to which people in
38 the settlement form densely connected and well separated communities. We do not consider the
39 links residents of a settlement have with other settlements. Fragmentation measures a settlement’s
40 bonding social capital. Before we proceed, we note that settlement will always be used to refer to a
41 municipality, while community refers to a group of nodes detected in the iWiW social network of a
42 settlement using a network science algorithm, in other words a subset of the nodes of the town which
43 are densely connected.
44 We measure fragmentation of the settlement’s internal social network using a community detection
45 method to identify communities of highly connected nodes. We use the Louvain algorithm [6], a
46 popular and efficient method leading to a partition of the network. We measure the quality of the
47 partition, the tendency of edges to be within rather than between the detected communities, using
48 modularity [45]. Given a social network of users in a settlement S and a partition of the network’s
49 nodes into K communities, the modularity Q(S) of the partition of the network can be written as:
50 K h w  L 2 i
51
X L k k
Q(S) = - ,
52 k=1
L L
53
where L is the total number of edges in the considered network, Lk is the number of edges adjacent
54
to members of community k, and Lw k is the number of edges within community k.

As modularity is highly dependent on the size and density of the network [61], we scale each
5
settlement’s modularity score in order to make valid comparisons between the settlements. Following
6
Sah et al. [60], we divide each settlement’s modularity score by the theoretical maximum modularity
7
Qmax (S) that the given partition could achieve, namely if all edges were within communities.

14 FS = Q(S)/Qmax (S). (1)
15
16 Fragmentation measures the tendency of individuals to belong to distinct communities within a set-
17 tlement. A fragmented settlement consists of tightly-knit communities that are weakly connected.
18 Both the excess of connections within and the rarity of connections between communities in frag-
19 mented networks are relevant to our theoretical framing of the origins of corruption as they indicate
20 excess bonding social capital. The high density of connections within a community facilitates the
21 enforcement of reciprocity, while having few connections between communities fosters particularism.
22 To better understand the concept of fragmentation, we compare two settlements, one at the 90th
23 percentile of fragmentation (settlement A) and the other at the 10th percentile (settlement B). The
24 two settlements have populations of roughly 10,000 and have iWiW user rates between 30 and 35%.
25 We randomly sample 300 users from both social networks for the sake of visualization and plot their
26 connections in Figure 3. Settlement A is clearly more fragmented than settlement B. We also show
27 the full adjacency matrices of the networks of these settlements, grouping nodes by their detected
28 communities into blocks on the diagonal shaded in red. We label each community by the share of its
29 edges staying within the community. The fragmented settlement has a clear over-representation of
30 within-community edges.
31
32 Diversity
33
34 Past research on online social networks noted that users connect with people from a variety of focal
experiences in their life-course [9]. For example a user may connect with her schoolmates, university
35
classmates, coworkers, family, and friends from environments including social clubs, sports teams,
36
or religious communities. We measure the diversity of an individual user’s network by the (lack of)
37
overlap between these foci. In this case, we do not restrict our attention to edges between users from
38
the same settlement.
39
Following Brooks et al. [9], we consider the connections amongst the friends of a focal user or ego,
40
i.e. the ego network without the ego. We then detect communities in the resulting network using the
41
Louvain algorithm [6]. We can assume that members of a community of alters share some common
42
context. We measure the separation of these communities of alters using modularity. Low modularity
43
indicates that a user’s connections tend to know each other, and that the user’s different spheres of life
44
involve the same people. High modularity indicates that the ego has a bridging role between weakly
45
connected communities, and so we refer to such users as having high diversity in their social networks.

We show examples of low and high diversity users with networks of similar sizes in Figure 4.
47
We aggregate this user level measure to a measure of settlement diversity DS by averaging each
48
user’s modularity score:

50 1 X
51 DS = Q({altersi }),
|S|
52 i<U+2208>S
53 where |S| is the number of nodes in the settlement S and {altersi } is the subgraph of the alters of
54 node i <U+2208> S. This measure captures the typical diversity of social perspectives that the members of
55 the settlement access. At the settlement level this measure captures bridging social capital.

28 Settlement diversity is positively correlated with share of the population graduating from high
29 school (<U+03C1> ˜ 0.62) and average income (<U+03C1> ˜ 0.55). Fragmentation and diversity are positively correlated
30 (<U+03C1> ˜ 0.46), which is not surprising given that both are calculated using network modularity. However,
31 the ego-focus and, more importantly, the inclusion of inter-settlement edges of the diversity measure
32 distinguish it from fragmentation, see the SI. Despite this correlation, we observe that they predict
33 different corruption outcomes.
34
35 Models
36
37 The primary aim of our paper is to relate bonding and bridging social capital in settlements to
38 corruption risk in their public contracts. Our hypothesis H1 is related to excess bonding social capital,
39 measured by fragmentation while hypothesis H2 refers surplus in bridging social capital, measured by
40 diversity. We predict average contract corruption risk at the settlement level using Ordinary Least
41 Squares (OLS) multiple regressions of the following form:
42
43 CS = ß1 * FS + ß2 * DS + XS * <U+03B8> + S
44 Where CS is one of two corruption risk indicators, averaged at the settlement level, FS is the
45 settlement’s fragmentation, DS is the settlement’s diversity, XS is a matrix of control variables defined
46 below, and S is an error term. The ß-s are scalar and <U+03B8> a vector of unknown parameters.
47 We include a variety of control variables in our regressions. Past research has found significant
48 relationships between wealth, education, employment and corruption [44] so we control for settlement
49 average income, its share of high school graduates, the presence of a university in the settlement, and
50 its unemployment and inactivity rates. As demographic features of settlements may influence the
51 measured social network we include total population, rate of iWiW use, and share of the population
52 over 60 in our models [52]. These socio-economic controls indicate 2011 levels when possible, as
53 2011 was the most recent Hungarian census. We also control for the settlement’s mayor’s average
54 victory margin in the 2002, 2006, 2010 elections as a proxy for the level of political competition in
55 the settlement, which has been found to be positively related with local quality of government [8].

Finally, we include a geographic feature of the settlements: the minimum travel distance in minutes
29
from the capital, Budapest. Past work indicates that distance from central authorities predicts higher
30
rates of corruption [10]. We present additional details on the control variables in the SI. For the sake
31
of comparison we fit a baseline models including only the control terms.
32
Implicit in our modeling framework is our choice to aggregate the social network measures, cor-
33
ruption risk scores, and controls of settlements into a single snapshot. Contracts range from 2006 to
34
2014, iWiW friendships from 2002 to 2012, and controls are set at 2011 levels (corresponding to the
35
last Hungarian census). As we are studying the relationship between social structure and corruption,
36
both long-run phenomena, we claim that this represents sufficient temporal overlap.
37
38
39 Results
40
41 We summarize our findings in Table 2. We see that there is a significant relationship between social
42 network structure and both dependent variables measuring corruption. More fragmentation consis-
43 tently predicts more corruption, while more diversity consistently predicts less corruption. In both
44 cases adding the network features significantly improves the adjusted R2 of the model. Moreover,
45 comparing the coefficients, we see that the social network features have effect sizes comparable to
46 that of any social, political, or economic control. We present the full models in the SI, including the
47 intermediate models containing only one network feature. All models pass a variance inflation factor
48 (VIF) test for feature collinearity, see the SI.
49 We visualize the effects of our network variables in Figure 5. We plot model predicted rate of
50 closed procedure or single bid contract awards (Ccsb ) including 90% confidence intervals for varying
51 levels of fragmentation and average ego diversity. As the variables are standardized, the units can
52 be interpreted as standard deviations from the mean (at 0). We observe that, all else equal, our
53 model predicts that going from one standard deviation below average fragmentation to one standard
54 deviation above average, increases Ccsb by about one half of a standard deviation. Diversity has a
55 stronger effect in the other direction: the same change (from one standard deviation below average to

38 Discussion
39
In this paper we used data from an online social network and a collection of public procurement
40 contracts to relate the social capital of Hungarian settlements to the corruption in its local government.
41 To our knowledge, this paper is the first to study social aspects of corruption using large-scale social
42 network data.
43 We introduced measures to quantify excess bonding and bridging social capital at the settlement
44 level from online social network data. We found that settlements with high bonding social capital tend
45 to award contracts with higher corruption risk. We also found that settlements with high bridging
46 social capital, tend to award lower corruption risk contracts. Social capital measures add substantive
47 predictive power to models of corruption outcomes, above baseline models controlling for other socio-
48 economic factors such as average income, education, political competition, and demography.
49 We recognize several limitations to our approach. An inherent challenge in the research of corrup-
50 tion is that proven cases are rare, and so our measures can only track risk or suspicion of corruption.
51 Moreover, we assume that steering contracts to certain firms by bureaucrats indicates corruption -
52 but it may happen that bureaucrats make socially optimal decisions using their local knowledge of
53 markets and discretion [15].
54 It is also clearly the case that iWiW is not a full map of social relations in Hungary and its users

do not make up a representative sample of the population. Finally, we do not claim to have found a
5
causal link between social capital and corruption risk. Besides the potential of omitted variable bias,
6
it is highly likely that corruption also influences social capital in the long run [58].
7
Despite these limitations we believe that our findings are valuable. Above all, our novel, data-
8
based, settlement-level approach provides new evidence for the old hypothesis that corruption is a
9
structural phenomenon. Our finding that social structure relates to corruption risk suggests, for
10
example, why appointing an ombudsman in a corrupt place rarely improves corruption outcomes [44]
11
and why anti-corruption laws can backfire if they conflict with prevailing social norms [1].
12
That is not to say that fighting corruption is futile. Rather we believe our findings suggest that
13
top-down efforts are unlikely to work unless they impact social capital or other significant covariates
14
of our model like political competition. Our conclusions hint at potential mechanisms which sustain
15
corruption. Factors such as racial segregation or economic inequality which may drive fragmentation
16
are ideal targets for policy interventions [59].

1.1 Description of iWiW data
7
8 In line with previous work on iWiW we filtered the data used in our analysis. We use the data from the
9 network at its peak activity in 2012. Out of roughly 4.5 million user accounts, we dropped the roughly
10 500,000 accounts with location outside of Hungary. We follow Lengyel et al. [37], we dropped the 193
11 users with more than 10,000 connections, arguing that such a large number of connections cannot
12 represent social ties. We argue that this cutoff balances two concerns: it excludes those accounts with
13 so many connections that it brings into question the nature of its connections, and we avoid truncating
14 the tail of the distribution of social connectivity too much, allowing for sociality to range over several
15 orders of magnitude. Many approaches to detect “fake” accounts in social network use the degree of
16 a node as an important input [11].
17 In Plot A of Figure 6 we plot the sensitivity of fragmentation and diversity to the maximum degree
18 threshold. If we discard all users with more than 100 connections (compared to the 10,000 connection
19 cutoff we use in our paper), fragmentation would be significantly higher and diversity significantly
20 lower than the versions we use in the paper. However this is not a reasonable cutoff as nearly 10%
21 of users have more than 500 connections (see Plot B, Figure 6). The settlement fragmentation and
22 diversity measures are within 5% of the versions we use in the paper if the threshold is set at 500,
23 1000, or 2000 connections.
24 In Figure 7 we show the relationship between settlement population and the number of iWiW
25 users listing their location in the settlement, and the share of the population registered to iWiW.
26 As mentioned in the text, user privacy is a key concern. The anonymized iWiW data was made
27 available to a consortium of researchers in Hungary, each of whom signed a non-disclosure agreement
28 (NDA) to use the data for research purposes only. As a result, only settlement level aggregated data
29 can be shared.
30
31 1.2 Corruption risk indicators
32
33 In this subsection we go into more detail regarding the individual corruption risk indicators. Each in-
34 dicator quantifies different ways bureaucrats have excluded competitors in qualitative work on ground
35 truth corruption cases from around the EU [22]. We stress that while no individual indicator or com-
36 posite measure can credibly suggest that an individual contract was awarded by a corrupt process,
37 aggregated over many contracts issued by the same institution these indicators map highly sugges-
38 tive patterns. This point is an important motivation for filtering out towns awarding less than five
39 contracts a year.
40
• Single bidder (Csinglebid ) is an outcome: was the contract awarded in a competition attracting
41
only a single offer.
42
43 • Closed procedure (Cclosedproc indicates when the contracting authority has decided to award
44 a contract by direct negotiation with a firm or via an invitation-only bidding process. This
45 decision can be used to completely subvert competition.
46
47 • No call for bids (Cnocall ) indicates when, in the case that the contract was awarded via an open
48 competition, no contract announcement or call for bids was published in the official procurement
49 journal. A corrupt official can greatly decrease the chance of non-favored firms participating by
50 limiting access to information.
51
• Long eligibility criteria (Celigcrit ) captures how bureaucrats can box out specific firms by adding
52
requirements to participation criteria. By including many such restrictions (regarding previous
53
experience, company size, qualifications), a corrupt bureaucrat can systematically exclude non-
54
favored firms.

4
• Extreme decision period (Cdecidetime highlights suspicious activity between the end of a com-
5
petition and the decision to award a contract. If the decision period is extremely short, this
6
suggests that the decision to award a specific firm was premeditated, and that the bids were not
7
carefully checked. If the decision period is very long, it may indicate that legal challenges about
8
the contract may be delaying the award decision.
9
10 • Short time to submit bids (Cbidtime ) indicates that favored firms may have been tipped off
11 about a competition for tenders ahead of the public announcement. By leaving only a short
12 time between the announcement and the award for non-favored firms, the corrupt official makes
13 it very difficult to submit a bid. It is important to remember that bids are complex legal
14 documents, including at times cost estimates, schematics, and references.
15
• Non-price criteria (Cnonprice ) tracks the share of non-price related or subjective criteria in the
16
evaluation of bids. For instance, a corrupt bureaucrat may reject a lower cost bid if, according
17
to a subjective criteria of the quality of a bid, it is less favorably evaluated than that of a higher
18
cost bid of a favored firm.
19
20 • Call for bids modified (Ccallmod ) checks to see if a call for bids was modified between the initial
21 announcment and the deadline. This potential corruption strategy closely emulates Cbidtime in
22 that a corrupt official can suddenly change the specifications or rules of a tender shortly before
23 the deadline.
24
25 1.3 Relationship between fragmentation and diversity
26
27 Fragmentation and diversity, our measures of bonding and bridging social capital respectively, are
28 positively and significantly correlated (<U+03C1> ˜ 0.46). Though fragmentation considers only edges within
29 the settlement and ego diversity includes external edges, both variables measure modularity in the
30 network. However, according to our hypotheses, they are expected to capture different kinds of so-
31 cialization. We found that despite their positive correlation these features have opposite relationships
32 with our corruption risk measures: high fragmentation is positively and high diversity is negatively
33 correlated with corruption risk. To test whether inter-settlement edges or the ego focus of diversity
34 does more to distinguish the measure from fragmentation we recalculated the diversity considering
35 only edges within the settlement. This alternative “internal” diversity measure is weakly correlated
36 (<U+03C1> ˜ 0.28) with fragmentation, and strongly correlated with diversity (<U+03C1> ˜ 0.72). This suggests
37 that both the connections to other settlements and the ego-focus of the diversity measure distinguish
38 fragmented settlements from diverse ones.
39
40 1.4 Model covariates and controls
41
42 In this appendix section we present the settlement-level variables used as controls in our models. We
43 also report their summary statistics. Note that in our models, we scale all features to have mean
44 0 and standard deviation 1. Our controls mostly refer to data from 2011, when the last large scale
45 Hungarian census took place and the data are of highest quality.
46 • Average income per capita (2011): Wealthier places tend to be less corrupt [44] as competition
47 for limited resources is expected to create greater incentive to cheat. Data on median income or
48 the income distribution at the settlement level were, to the best our knowledge, not available in
49 Hungary.
50
51 • Population (log)(2011): Larger cities may have different contracting needs, different political
52 and social norms, and different network characteristics.
53 • Number of contracts awarded (log): Settlements contracting more frequently may be more expe-
54 rienced and may follow better practices. As more people are involved in contracting, corruption
55 may become more difficult.

24
25 • Rate of iWiW use (2012): The rate of iWiW use both proxies for the economic development of
26 the settlement and controls for differences in observed social network structure resulting from
27 differences in access to the web. Previous work suggests that iWiW users, especially the early
28 adopters, skew young and wealthy [37].
29
30 • Average mayoral victory margin: Measured across three elections (2002, 2006, 2010), this vari-
31 able proxies for the lack of political competition in the settlement. The absence of political
32 competition has been shown to correlate with corruption [8].
33
34 • Share of population with at least a high school diploma (2011): Education is typically correlated
35 with better control of corruption [59].
36 • Share of working-age population inactive and unemployment rate (2011): Counting the long-
37 term and short-term unemployed respectively, these variables quantify economic stagnation.
38 The economic hardship connected with high unemployment is conjectured to worsen political
39 corruption [62].
40
41 • The minimum travel distance to Budapest, the capital city: This variable captures the physical
42 isolation of the settlement from the main economic, political, and social hub of the country. Past
43 research has shown that geographic isolation reduces accountability and increases corruption [10].
44
45 • Share of population over 60 years old (2011): This variable controls for the over-representation
46 of the elderly. The elderly are underrepresented on online social networks and tend to use these
47 platforms differently than younger users [52].
48 • Whether the settlement has a university (2011): This variable controls for the presence of a place
49 of higher education in the settlement, including local branches of universities headquartered
50 elsewhere. this which inflates the number of young people, hence likely iWiW users in the
51 settlement.

1.5 Model results, diagnostics, and feature importances
5
6 We present the full model results in Table 4. Note that all variables are standardized with mean 0
7 and standard deviation 1. This aids interpretation, for example: a one standard deviation increase in
8 the settlement’s mayor’s average margin of victory increases corruption risk by roughly one quarter
9 of a standard deviation. We also present models including only one of the two network measures in
10 Table 5. The effect and significance of both features is preserved when the other is excluded.
11 The estimated coefficients of the control variables and their levels of statistical significance offer
12 additional insight into the phenomenon of corruption risk. Wealthier settlements are in general less
13 corrupt, though the effect is not significant for CRI. Rate of iWiW use is not related with corruption
14 risk and this does not change when we include the social capital features. The average mayoral victory
15 margin is a highly significant positive predictor of corruption risk. One potential explanation is that
16 mayors, who do not face significant competition do not fear being voted out of office if they are corrupt.
17 Similarly settlements that are far from Budapest, which our models predict to be significantly more
18 corrupt, may be insulated from investigation by the central authorities simply by being out of the
19 spotlight.
20 One potential source of bias in the coefficient estimates of multiple regression models is collinearity
21 among the predictors. We test for multi-collinearity for each predictor using a variance inflation factor
22 (VIF) test, defined as the ratio of variance in the full model over the variance of the single-predictor
23 model. We run this diagnostic for each predictor used in models (2) and (4) in the main text and
24 report the results in Table 1.5. A popular rule of thumb is that VIF values under 10 denote acceptable
25 levels of correlation between variables [31]. As it is near our limit, we reran our analyses without the
26 “Share of population inactive” control variable, finding no substantive change in our results. The
27 relevant model tables are available on request.
28 We show the relative variable importances of Model (6) (column 6 in Table 2), the fully specific
29 model predicting average CRI, using an Analysis of Variance F-test in Figure 8. We include only
30 terms with a significant ANOVA F-test. Though other features have stronger predictive power, the
31 social network features are more useful in predicting corruption risk than economic variables like
32 unemployment, inactivity, and average income.

51 The measures are within 5% of the version we use in the paper for cutoffs at or above 500. B) The
52 distribution of user connections on a log scale. Very few users (193) have more than 10,000 connections,
53 while many (405,337) have more than 500.
