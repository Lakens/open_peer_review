This manuscript describes a relatively straightforward transcriptomics study looking at changes
in gene expression following mating, compared to virgin females, in the egg parasitoid Anastatus
disparis. The comparison involves only one time point (approximately two hours since mating,
although it would be beneficial if this was more clearly and precisely explained in the
manuscript). To provide some behavioural context for the gene expression study, the authors also
explore changes in mating behaviour and egg production for mated and virgin females over 5
days. The authors show that a number of genes are differentially expressed, with the majority
being down-regulated in mated females. The nature of the differentially expressed genes is
briefly discussed.
Overall, the paper is well-written and clear to read. The scope of the study is not broad, but the
analysis and interpretation appears reasonable and suitable. As such, I have only a few
comments.
(1) Please clarify time between mating and flash-freezing (as accurately as possible).
(2) Line 54: “egg load” c.f. “egg loaded”.
(3) Sample sizes pre replicate are limited for gene expression studies – in future, please try and
increase library sizes.
(4) Line 106: “In addition” c.f. “Besides”.
(5) Please give denominator degrees of freedom as well as numerator d.f.s when presenting F test
statistics.
(6) Line 136: the four degrees of freedom reported here suggest a non-directional test (i.e.
ANOVA-like) compared to a directional test (i.e. regression-like), as is then used in the next
sentence. I also suggest a directional test for the former data, and in both cases for the regression
coefficient and standard error also to be reported.
(7) Figure 2: y – axis to say “eggs” c.f. “eggs loaded”.
(8) Please give the methods for the qRT-PCR in the Methods section, and present the results and
figures in the Results section. I am not sure why this is in the Discussion.
(9) Line 153: replace “egg loads” with “eggs”.
(10) I would like to see a Table of all 77 DEGs in the main paper.
(11) Line 170: do the authors mean that some re-mate if they have mated with sperm depleted
males? This is not very clear.
(12) Is PBAN used in all insects? More information about this neuropeptide is needed I think. For
instance, how unusual (and therefore how broadly significant) is this result?
(13) I was not very convinced by the discussion about female vision-related genes and mating.
The authors need to be more clear here. Are they suggesting that females down regulate vision
after mating because they no longer need to see males? If so, is their vision impaired, and how
does that influence foraging? Also, the citation on line 188 is about lepidoptera – how is this
relevant to these wasps, and if females visually attract males, why does female vision change, as
male vision is important if females do the attracting. Please sort this out.
(14) Please move Tables 2 and into Results and briefly summarise there.
(15) Finally, the paper does not discuss other gene expression studies in parasitoids, and yet there
are some studies now. Perhaps some of those should be mentioned and discussed, especially
where related to reproductive behaviour, such as mating or oviposition.

Review of Liu & Hao: “Behavioural and transcriptional changes in post-mating females of an egg
parasitoid wasp species”
In this study, the authors have examined the impact of mating on parasitoid wasps. Specifically,
they have used transcriptomics, behavioral assays, and measures of egg load to compare virgin
and mated adult females. The behavioral results are quite clear, and give good support that A.
disparis mate just once. The transcriptomic analysis yielded a number of differentially expressed
genes/GO terms, many with good relevance to egg maturation and reproduction. This is an
interesting study, and these results are valuable for future work understanding mating behavior
in parasitoids. However, several key pieces of information are missing from the methods and
results, and I think expansion in these areas is necessary for publication.
** Major inclusions:
1. The most striking gap, that I assume is just an editing error, is the absence of the qPCR from the
Abstract/Introduction/Methods/Results. This appears only in the Discussion and Supplemental
materials. Please incorporate this into the main MS, along with an explanation of why you chose
the PBAN gene. Additionally, since this candidate did not yield differences between treatments,
it would be useful to include a more thorough discussion of this result. Currently this portion of
the Discussion (around line 181) seems like important results for the “Mating” section of the
Results, rather than discussion.
2. It would be appropriate to include more specific methods in the “Transcriptomic analysis”
section of the methods, especially to cite the programs that you used! In particular, what did you
use to clean your reads? Which version of Trinity? How did you map your reads for counts? Did
you incorporate RSEM reads into DESeq2 using tximport (as the authors recommend)?
3. “Mating” section of the methods. Can you please list the actual traits you measured to estimate
condition of mating (line 91)
4
4. “Statistical analysis” section of methods. Please list & cite all of the packages you used in R.
5. Some clarification of the differential expression results is needed. First, I think this would be
helped by a small table summarizing the actual number of DE genes and GO terms. Second,
please clarify your statistical cutoffs. The methods say you have used FC>2 and FDR>0.1. But,
looking at Additional file 1, 59 of the 77 DE results have a fold change less than two, and you
appear to have used a FDR cutoff of 0.5. I don’t have a huge problem with this, since I think that
interesting and valid results can fall under these less stringent cutoffs. But this is not what you
state in the methods. Along with this, I’m not sure if I would consider the expression changes you
observe to be “substantial” (Discussion line 144). There are good candidates in your results, but
the actual number of genes is quite small.
6. Tables 2 and 3 (DE genes from vision and OBPs) should include that statistics associated with
these transcripts- especially fold change and p-value.
7. Line 137. Do you mean that there was no difference at (not after) day 5? It doesn’t look to me
like you measured egg load after 5 days.
**Minor corrections:
8. Line 42 should perhaps read aspects “including” superparasitism, ….
9. Line 50: I didn’t know that Lymantria is a moth, so it would be nice to include that information
for those outside of the field. This also applies to line 60 for Antheraea!
10. Line 54, should probably read “Besides identifying changes…”
11. Line 64: …before “the” start of the experiment.
12. Line 70: replicates, not replication
13. Line 70: virgin OR mated
14. Lines 109/111. Please list the 8.57Gb and 24 million reads in the same units (either reads or
GB)!

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Ryan Y Wong):
Dear Dr. Liu,
Your manuscript was reviewed by 2 reviewers. Both reviewers agree that this study would be of
value to those studying parasitoid wasps. However a number of concerns were also raised. From
my own reading of the paper, I would recommend that you provide an assessment of the quality
and accuracy of the de novo transcriptome assembly; There are a number of tools available that
provide such metrics. I also recommend the authors conduct a gene ontology analysis to assess
which gene ontology terms are over- or under-enriched. Other methodological details such as
whether sample was whole-body or tissue-specific, and qPCR details should be included in the
main text. The raw sequencing data should be uploaded to a repository; further you should also
provide in the supplementary files a file containing the dataset that went into the analyses. A
major revision is required before we can consider your work any further. In the revised version,
you should address each point of the reviewers.

Dear Pengcheng Liu,
12
Thank you for the thoughtful responses to the prior concerns. I have a few minor comments that
can be addressed without sending for further review. For the qRT-PCR samples, be sure to
describe whether samples were individual insects or pooled insects like the RNA-seq step. Also
be sure to include the concentration of the primers used for the qRT-PCR. A p-value for whether
a GO term was significantly over- or under-enriched should also be included in the results
section. In the revised table 3, I suggest adding a column with the gene name (or symbol) for
readers not familiar with database IDs.

Appendix A
Dear Editor and Reviewers,
Many thanks for your input and the very helpful comments from
Editors and Reviewers. As suggested, the sections of method and
discussion were strengthened. I attach the revised manuscript. If there
remain any shortcomings in the paper then please just e-mail me and I
will revise them as soon as possible. My responses to each comment
are below.
Associate Editor's comments (Dr Ryan Y Wong):
Dear Dr. Liu,
Your manuscript was reviewed by 2 reviewers. Both reviewers agree
that this study would be of value to those studying parasitoid wasps.
However a number of concerns were also raised. From my own
reading of the paper, I would recommend that you provide an
assessment of the quality and accuracy of the de novo transcriptome
assembly; There are a number of tools available that provide such
metrics. I also recommend the authors conduct a gene ontology
analysis to assess which gene ontology terms are over- or
under-enriched. Other methodological details such as whether
sample was whole-body or tissue-specific, and qPCR details should be
included in the main text. The raw sequencing data should be uploaded
to a repository; further you should also provide in the supplementary
files a file containing the dataset that went into the analyses. A major
revision is required before we can consider your work any further. In
the revised version, you should address each point of the reviewers.
Response:
1. I have provided an assessment of quality of the transcriptome
assembly. Besides, I also provided an assessment of sequence quality
(i.e., Q30).
2. We conducted a gene ontology analysis to assess which
gene ontology terms are over- or under-enriched, and these results
were added in revised manuscript.
3. The methodological details were described as following the
comments, and the qPCR details and results were included in the main
text.
4. The raw sequencing data were uploaded to a repository.

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript describes a relatively straightforward transcriptomics
study looking at changes in gene expression following mating,
compared to virgin females, in the egg parasitoid Anastatus disparis.
The comparison involves only one time point (approximately two
hours since mating, although it would be beneficial if this was more
clearly and precisely explained in the manuscript). To provide some
behavioural context for the gene expression study, the authors also
explore changes in mating behaviour and egg production for mated
and virgin females over 5 days. The authors show that a number of
genes are differentially expressed, with the majority being
down-regulated in mated females. The nature of the differentially
expressed genes is briefly discussed.
Overall, the paper is well-written and clear to read. The scope of the
study is not broad, but the analysis and interpretation appears
reasonable and suitable. As such, I have only a few comments.
(1) Please clarify time between mating and flash-freezing (as
accurately as possible).
Response: In revised manuscript, the time between mating and
flash-freezing was detailedly described.
(2) Line 54: “egg load” c.f. “egg loaded”.
Response: It have been rephrased in revised manuscript.
(3) Sample sizes pre replicate are limited for gene expression
studies – in future, please try and increase library sizes.
Response: Thank you very much. I will increase the library sizes in
future studies.
(4) Line 106: “In addition” c.f. “Besides”.
Response: It have been rephrased in revised manuscript.
(5) Please give denominator degrees of freedom as well as
numerator d.f.s when presenting F test statistics.
Response: It have been rephrased in revised manuscript.
(6) Line 136: the four degrees of freedom reported here suggest
a non-directional test (i.e. ANOVA-like) compared to a directional test
(i.e. regression-like), as is then used in the next sentence. I also suggest
a directional test for the former data, and in both cases for the
regression coefficient and standard error also to be reported.
Response: It have been rephrased in revised manuscript. A directional
test of correlation analysis was conducted, and the regression
coefficient and standard error were also reported.
(7) Figure 2: y – axis to say “eggs” c.f. “eggs loaded”.
Response: It have been rephrased in revised manuscript.
(8) Please give the methods for the qRT-PCR in the Methods
section, and present the results and figures in the Results section. I am
not sure why this is in the Discussion.
Response: It have been rephrased in revised manuscript.
(9) Line 153: replace “egg loads” with “eggs”.
Response: It have been rephrased in revised manuscript.
(10) I would like to see a Table of all 77 DEGs in the main paper.
Response: A table of all DEGs have been added in revised manuscript.
(11) Line 170: do the authors mean that some re-mate if they have
mated with sperm depleted males? This is not very clear.
Response: Yes. My meaning is that some female may re-mated if they
have mated with sperm depleted males. I re-described in revised
manuscript.
(12) Is PBAN used in all insects? More information about this
neuropeptide is needed I think. For instance, how unusual (and
therefore how broadly significant) is this result?
Response: Many studies on lepidopteran species and other insect
orders (e.g., Hymenoptera) showed that pheromone biosynthesis
in females is stimulated by PBAN, and the related references
were cited. This information were described in Methods before
conducting the q-PCR analysis which explained the reason of
choosing the PBAN gene.
Besides, this result of PBAN gene have no different expression
between virgin and mated female, suggested that as production of
attractant may not cease or diminish after mating, mating might not
causes changes in female’s attractiveness to male. Female mated only
once in A. disparis might be unlikely to cause by mated females with
less attractiveness (also see Cotesia flavipes). These information have
been rephrased in revised manuscript.
(13) I was not very convinced by the discussion about female
vision-related genes and mating. The authors need to be more clear
here. Are they suggesting that females down regulate vision after
mating because they no longer need to see males? If so, is their vision
impaired, and how does that influence foraging? Also, the citation on
line 188 is about lepidoptera – how is this relevant to these wasps, and
if females visually attract males, why does female vision change, as
male vision is important if females do the attracting. Please sort this
out.
Response: In the revised manuscript, this section was rephrased. First,
related references about Hymenoptera (e.g., honey bee and Apis
florae) involving vision genes change after mating were cited.
Second, in previous manuscript, we described that female vision
change influencing females visually attract males was inaccuracy
and unconvinced. Therefore, we rephrased that changed
expression of vision genes could impact female’s response to
other females or males, and the related reference was cited.
(14) Please move Tables 2 and into Results and briefly summarise
there.
Response: A table of all DEGs have been added in revised manuscript.
So, these two tables were deleted.
(15) Finally, the paper does not discuss other gene expression studies
in parasitoids, and yet there are some studies now. Perhaps some of
those should be mentioned and discussed, especially where related to
reproductive behaviour, such as mating or oviposition.
Response: Many other genes were discussed and mentioned, such as
involving metabolic of lipid, carbohydrate, chitin and amino,
cytochrome P450, proteases metabolism and signal transduction.
First, most genes involving metabolic of lipid, carbohydrate and amino
acid were downregulated, which may reflect a trade-off between
reproductive and nonreproductive processes;
Second, a cytochrome P450 gene was upregulated by mating in
females, which may involve in detoxification;
Third, postmating expression levels of protease genes change, which
may involve in protecting females from harmful proteins
introduced during mating. These information and references were
listed and cited in revised manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
Review of Liu & Hao: “Behavioural and transcriptional changes in
post-mating females of an egg parasitoid wasp species”
In this study, the authors have examined the impact of mating on
parasitoid wasps. Specifically, they have used transcriptomics,
behavioral assays, and measures of egg load to compare virgin and
mated adult females. The behavioral results are quite clear, and give
good support that A. disparis mate just once. The transcriptomic
analysis yielded a number of differentially expressed genes/GO terms,
many with good relevance to egg maturation and reproduction. This
is an interesting study, and these results are valuable for future work
understanding mating behavior in parasitoids. However, several key
pieces of information are missing from the methods and results, and I
think expansion in these areas is necessary for publication.
** Major inclusions:
1. The most striking gap, that I assume is just an editing error,
is the absence of the qPCR from the
Abstract/Introduction/Methods/Results. This appears only in the
Discussion and Supplemental materials. Please incorporate this into
the main MS, along with an explanation of why you chose the PBAN
gene. Additionally, since this candidate did not yield differences
between treatments, it would be useful to include a more thorough
discussion of this result. Currently this portion of the Discussion
(around line 181) seems like important results for the “Mating” section
of the Results, rather than discussion.
Response: 1. Related described about the qPCR was incorporated into
the main MS, and an explanation of the reason that chose the
PBAN gene was also supplied in the section of Methods;
2. We re-discussed this result that as production of attractant may not
cease or diminish after mating, mating might not causes changes
in female’s attractiveness to male, and female mated only once in
A. disparis might be unlikely to cause by mated females with less
attractiveness (also see Cotesia flavipes). And some related
references were also cited. Please see the details in revised
manuscript.
3.Your mentioned sentence was moved into the mating section of the
results.
2. It would be appropriate to include more specific methods in
the “Transcriptomic analysis” section of the methods, especially to cite
the programs that you used! In particular, what did you use to clean
your reads? Which version of Trinity? How did you map your reads
for counts? Did you incorporate RSEM reads into DESeq2 using
tximport (as the authors recommend)?
Response: In the revised manuscript, this section was strengthened:
1) Clean reads were obtained from the raw data using FASTX-Toolkit
(http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/);
2) The version of Trinity is v2.5.1;
3) Bowtie was used to align reads to unigenes, then identified putative
expressed genes by RSEM;
4) We incorporate RSEM reads into DESeq2 using tximport;
5) The version of blastx is v2.2.31.
All these information and references were listed and cited in revised
manuscript.
3. “Mating” section of the methods. Can you please list the
actual traits you measured to estimate condition of mating (line 91)
Response: The condition of mating (e.g., whether and when exhibited
mating behavior, mating times) was examined, and the related
described was listed in the revised manuscript.
4. “Statistical analysis” section of methods. Please list & cite all
of the packages you used in R.
Response: For the analysis of GLMM, we used the lme4 package
which was cited in revised manuscript,
5. Some clarification of the differential expression results is
needed. First, I think this would be helped by a small table
summarizing the actual number of DE genes and GO terms. Second,
please clarify your statistical cutoffs. The methods say you have used
FC>2 and FDR>0.1. But, looking at Additional file 1, 59 of the 77 DE
results have a fold change less than two, and you appear to have used a
FDR cutoff of 0.5. I don’t have a huge problem with this, since I think
that interesting and valid results can fall under these less stringent
cutoffs. But this is not what you state in the methods. Along with this,
I’m not sure if I would consider the expression changes you observe to
be “substantial” (Discussion line 144). There are good candidates in
your results, but the actual number of genes is quite small.
Response: First, in revised manuscript, we provided a small table
summarizing the number of DEGs and GO terms. Besides, a table
of all DEGs have been added based on comments of reviewer 1.
Second, we have carefully clarified our statistical cutoffs of a 2-fold
change (FC) (i.e., log2<U+F07C>FC<U+F07C>=1) and a false discovery rate [FDR] <0.01.
in previous manuscript, we actually used a FDR cutoff of 0.05, and
was revised in revised manuscript.
However, you found that “many DEGs have a fold change less than
two”. There might be a misunderstanding that we listed the FC was
transferred by Log2 . Therefore, there were many DGEs (55) in our
results.
6. Tables 2 and 3 (DE genes from vision and OBPs) should
include that statistics associated with these transcripts- especially fold
change and p-value.
Response: In our revised manuscript, a) previous Tables 2 and 3 were
deleted, because a table of all DEGs have been added based on
comments of reviewer 1; b) In the new table, statistics index of
fold change (i.e.,log2FC) and p-value (i.e., FDR) were added.
7. Line 137. Do you mean that there was no difference at (not
after) day 5? It doesn’t look to me like you measured egg load after 5
days.
Response: In our revised manuscript, we have revised that at day 5, the
mature egg counts of the mated females (10.77±0.82) and virgins
(10.29±1.26) were not significantly different.
**Minor corrections:
8. Line 42 should perhaps read aspects “including”
superparasitism, ….
Response: It have been revised.
9. Line 50: I didn’t know that Lymantria is a moth, so it would
be nice to include that information for those outside of the field. This
also applies to line 60 for Antheraea!
Response: Lymantria dispar is an important defoliator on broad-leaf
and conifer trees, and Antheraea pernyi is of commercial interest
due to their pupae use in silk production. All these information
were listed in revised manuscript
10. Line 54, should probably read “Besides identifying
changes…”
Response: It have been revised.
11. Line 64: …before “the” start of the experiment.
Response: It have been revised.
12. Line 70: replicates, not replication
Response: It have been revised.
13. Line 70: virgin OR mated
Response: It have been revised.
14. Lines 109/111. Please list the 8.57Gb and 24 million reads in
the same units (either reads or GB)!
Response: In our revised manuscript, we used the same units (GB) to
describe the raw data and clean reads.
Appendix B
Dear Editors,
Many thanks for your input and the very helpful comments. If there
remain any shortcomings in the paper then please just e-mail me and I
will revise them as soon as possible. My responses to each comment
are below.
Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Ryan Y Wong):
Dear Pengcheng Liu,
Thank you for the thoughtful responses to the prior concerns. I have a
few minor comments that can be addressed without sending for further
review. For the qRT-PCR samples, be sure to describe whether
samples were individual insects or pooled insects like the RNA-seq
step. Also be sure to include the concentration of the primers used for
the qRT-PCR. A p-value for whether a GO term was significantly
over- or under-enriched should also be included in the results section.
In the revised table 3, I suggest adding a column with the gene name
(or symbol) for readers not familiar with database IDs.
Response:
1. The sample was whole-body, and related description was
included in the main text;
2. The concentration of the primers used for the qRT-PCR was
added;
3. Also, p-values for GO terms, and a column with number in
Table 3 were added in revised manuscript.
