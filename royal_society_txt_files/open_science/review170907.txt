(By Ji et al.)
The manuscript by Ji and co-workers describes the detailed study of transcriptomic analysis with
a possible pathway potentially regulating the formation of the high-quality brush hair in Haimen
Goat which is local breed in China. The experimental design was successful, and the overall
scientific question and methods were sound. Of course, the study is interesting and important for
the mechanism of the formation of the Type <U+2162> brush hair in Chinese Haimen goat. On the whole,
the paper is suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science, but it needs some revisions,
and the following concerns should be addressed.
1. The Introduce section should be divided into at least two paragraphs for more clear to readers.
2. Is there any genetic relationships the sampled goats? Please address this.
3. Please give more explanation about sampling:how and from which part of goat you sampled.
4. The authors should provide more detail information on Real-time quantitative PCR reaction,
such as final volume and thermal cycling conditions etc.

Transcriptomic Inspection Revealed a Possible Pathway Regulating the Formation of the High-
Quality Brush Hair in Chinese Haimen Goat (Capra hircus) by Ji et al is an interesting work.
However, too much shotcoming point need re-revise, please check my comments.
Specific Comment
1. Reads were aligned to the goat reference genome, but no description of the genome vesion, is
it CHIR_1.0 or CHIR_2.0 or others???. There are one more recent goat genome assemblies based
on different goat breeds, ASM170441v1. Please use this one . This should increase your mapping
rate.
2. A high number of lncRNAs were identified, and likely contains a significant fraction of false
positives. Three different tools were used in the selection of final candidate lncRNAs, but what
were the criteria for inclusion in the final set? E.g. did the potential lncRNAs have to be
supported by more than one tool?
3. How were transcripts identified? Cufflinks?, why?
4. GO analysis was performed for functional annotation of differentially expressed genes, and
KEGG database was used to identify potentially implicated pathways. What tools were used for
this, GO Enrichment Analysis and KEGG Pathway? These tools do not require expression p-
values. Was expression levels and p-values taken into account? Please justify.
5. Some genes were validated using qPCR. What were the selection criteria for inclusion?
Please include the relative expression in RNA-Seq for these genes in the figure or at least if they
were up- or down-regulated.
6. All aspects within the bioinformatics analysis should be cleared.
7. Authors do not indicate how the assembly of the aligned transcripts is performed
8. Authors do not indicate the annotation file used for the differential expression analysis. They
mention in the results section (lines 14 and 15, page 5) a reference constructed for gene
annotation, but they do not indicate in the material and methods section how this dataset has
been constructed.
9. In some parts of the results-discussion, authors reference an analysis of isoforms and
transcription factors (for instance, lines 15-20; page 6 or lines 18 and 19; page 5) which are not the
goal of the study. Please clarify these parts. Do the authors have also performed an isoforms or
transcription facto analysis?
10. Authors should specify when they discuss about a particular GO term or pathway in which of
the analyzed conditions are enriched the genes grouped under this functional category.
11. Much of your discussion and conclusions hinge upon your pathway analysis, which is very
speculative, as the validity of this analysis is in question, as noted above.
12. Considering the major flaws in study design, if the authors presented the RNA-seq as an
exploratory analysis, with the qPCR as a second more stringent criterion for identifying DEGs,
and then followed up only those significant genes from qPCR in the discussion, removing all
discussions of pathway analysis, this manuscript would be more credible.
13. Please describe in detail the sample classification and trait classification conditions, and refer
to the picture description. The experimental method described in this paper is too simple to
describe, and there is the possibility of plagiarism.
4
14. How to sample collection, how to carry the dermis layer? Or hair follicle tissue separation? In
addition to the description of the text, and reference to the picture description
15. For animal ethics, please provide proof of the original material of University.
16. The discussion part is too shallow to explain this physiological phenomenon. Please rewrite
the discussion section.
17. The language needs to be heavy re-modified.

Associate Editor's comments:
To be considered for publication in Royal Society Open Science, manuscripts need to meet
international standards for English language. Language in submitted articles must be clear,
correct, and unambiguous. Prior to re-submission we recommend that the manuscript receives
language editing or proofing by a native english speaker to improve clarity.
Subject Editor:
This manuscript contains some novel data and important findings that are worth publishing with
regard to molecular analysis of high quality brush hair in goat. There are two issues with the
manuscript: 1) Reviewer 2 raises some serious methodological problems with the manuscript that
need addressing. It is critical these are addressed so the data in the manuscript can be reproduced
if required. 2) The AE states that the written English is not good enough. I agree with both of
these points. Major revision is required.
For help improving your use of the English language, we recommend that your paper be passed
onto a language polishing service. You can find a list of services the journal recommends here:

changes in the revised paper, and have no way to keep the sign of revisions. We are grateful of the hard
work of reviewers and hope the revision could answer major part of the comments.
Reviewer1 Comments to the Author(s):
Review report on RSOS-170907 (By Ji et al.)
The manuscript by Ji and co-workers describes the detailed study of transcriptomic analysis with a possible
pathway potentially regulating the formation of the high-quality brush hair in Haimen Goat which is local
breed in China. The experimental design was successful, and the overall scientific question and methods
were sound. Of course, the study is interesting and important for the mechanism of the formation of the
Type <U+2162> brush hair in Chinese Haimen goat. On the whole, the paper is suitable for publication in Royal
Society Open Science, but it needs some revisions, and the following concerns should be addressed.
1.The Introduce section should be divided into at least two paragraphs for more clear to readers.
Answer: Thanks for the good suggestion. We have divided the introduction into two parts: one is the
ntroduction of the background of subject, the other is the research background of the formation mechanism
of the high-quality brush hair.
2.Is there any genetic relationships the sampled goats? Please address this.
Answer: the six sampled goats are half-sibling healthy male goats, which were inseminated by the same
breeder ram.
3.Please give more explanation about sampling: how and from which part of goat you sampled.
Answer: Thanks for good question. For the high-quality brush hair grows only on the cervical carina region
of Haimen goat. Moreover, little proof indicated that any other breed across the world could produce the
high-quality brush hair.
4.The authors should provide more detail information on Real-time quantitative PCR reaction, such as final
volume and thermal cycling conditions etc.
Answer: Thanks for the good suggestion. We have added the detailed PCR system and protocol.
5.In Figure 2, the error bars stand for what? Standard error or standard deviation within groups? Please
address.
Answer: Thanks for directing our missing information. The lines over the bars indicated the value of
tandard deviation. We added the information in the qPCR validation passage.
6.Figure 1 appears to be not very clear, if possible, please provide a clearer one.
Answer: Thanks for directing our weak point in the picture. As the journal requires TIFF file, we
ransferred again the original *.pdf format into TIFF format, we hope the picture will become clearer than
before.
7.Throughout text, please carefully check grammar for English use, and correct them.
Answer: Thanks for directing our weak point in the language. A senior researcher from USA has helped
polishing the language.
Reviewer2 Comments to the Author(s):
Reviewer reports:
Transcriptomic Inspection Revealed a Possible Pathway Regulating the Formation of the High-Quality
Brush Hair in Chinese Haimen Goat (Capra hircus) by Ji et al is an interesting work. However, too much
hortcoming point need re-revise, please check my comments.
Specific Comment
1. Reads were aligned to the goat reference genome, but no description of the genome version, is it
CHIR_1.0 or CHIR_2.0 or others???. There are one more recent goat genome assemblies based on different
goat breeds, ASM170441v1. Please use this one . This should increase your mapping rate.
Answer: Thanks for the good suggestion. This analysis adopted the method of non-reference genome, and
we will compare the recommended goat genome ASM170441v1 in further researches.
2. A high number of lncRNAs were identified, and likely contains a significant fraction of false positives.
Three different tools were used in the selection of final candidate lncRNAs, but what were the criteria for
nclusion in the final set? E.g. did the potential lncRNAs have to be supported by more than one tool?
Answer: Thanks for the good suggestion. The lncRNAs were not explored in detail in this paper. We
compared transcripts to the sequences in NR Protein, SwissProt, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG), and eggNOG databases using BLAST and discarded all the unaligned RNAs, including
ncRNAs.
3. How were transcripts identified? Cufflinks?, why?
Answer: Thanks for the good question. A K-mer library was constructed with the filtered reads, and the
contigs were formed using Inchworm. Using Chrysalis, a component was built with the contigs, and de
Bruijn graphs were generated. Then, Butterfly was used to optimize the de Bruijn graphs and create the
inal transcript through paths. Blast2GO was used for the Gene Ontology (GO) and Unigene annotations.
4. GO analysis was performed for functional annotation of differentially expressed genes, and KEGG
database was used to identify potentially implicated pathways. What tools were used for this, GO
Enrichment Analysis and KEGG Pathway? These tools do not require expression p-values. Was expression
evels and p-values taken into account? Please justify.
Answer: Thanks for directing our missing information. Blast2go program was used to annotate the
unigenes on the basis of GO terms and NR database annotation. the KEGG Automatic Annotation Server
(KAAS)was used to perform pathway annotation. Pathways with a Qvalue=0.05 were considered
ignificantly enriched. We have added the detailed information in the revised paper.
5. Some genes were validated using qPCR. What were the selection criteria for inclusion?
Please include the relative expression in RNA-Seq for these genes in the figure or at least if they were up-
or down-regulated.
Answer: Thanks for the good suggestion. We selected these genes based on the DEGs results and the
change of expression, and used GAPDH as a reference. Among the six genes, 4 genes were up- regulated
and 2 genes were down- regulated. We added the detailed information in the revised paper.
6. All aspects within the bioinformatics analysis should be cleared.
Answer: Thanks for the good suggestion. We have added the detailed bioinformatics information at each
tep in the revised paper.
7. Authors do not indicate how the assembly of the aligned transcripts is performed
Answer: Thanks for directing our missing information. In brief, De novo transcriptome assembly was
performed using Trinity (http://trinityrnaseq.sf.net) . A K-mer library was constructed with the filtered reads,
and the contigs were formed using Inchworm. Using Chrysalis, a component was built with the contigs, and
de Bruijn graphs were generated. Then, Butterfly was used to optimize the de Bruijn graphs and create the
inal transcript through paths. We have added the detailed information in the revised paper.
8. Authors do not indicate the annotation file used for the differential expression analysis. They mention in
he results section (lines 14 and 15, page 5) a reference constructed for gene annotation, but they do not
ndicate in the material and methods section how this dataset has been constructed.
Answer: Thanks for directing our missing information. DEGs were then identified using an FDR=0.001
false discovery rate no greater than 0.05) and an absolute value of log2Ratio=1 (two-fold change) as the
ignificance thresholds for DEGs. The DEGs were then compared to the sequences in NR Protein,
SwissProt databases using BLAST and unigene annotations using Blast2GO software
https://www.blast2go.com/).We have added the detailed information in the revised paper.
9. In some parts of the results-discussion, authors reference an analysis of isoforms and transcription factors
for instance, lines 15-20; page 6 or lines 18 and 19; page 5) which are not the goal of the study. Please
clarify these parts. Do the authors have also performed an isoforms or transcription facto analysis?
Answer: Thanks for the good suggestion. We did not performed any isoform or transcription factor analysis
n this paper. We removed all the sentences not quite associated with the paper theme.
10. Authors should specify when they discuss about a particular GO term or pathway in which of the
analyzed conditions are enriched the genes grouped under this functional category.
Answer: Thanks for the good suggestion. To annotate genes with common denominators or functional
categories, the unigenes were also aligned to the eggNOG database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/,
http://eggnog.embl.de/version_3.0/). To summarize the pathway information, the KEGG Automatic
Annotation Server(KAAS)was used to perform pathway annotation. Pathways with a Qvalue=0.05 were
considered significantly enriched. We have added the detailed information in the revised paper.
11. Much of your discussion and conclusions hinge upon your pathway analysis, which is very speculative,
as the validity of this analysis is in question, as noted above.
Answer: Thanks for the good suggestion and comments. For this trait of high-quality goat hair is rarely
explored so far, and no established pathways or mechanisms could be referred, we managed to combined
he past observation, experience, and established pathways on certain points and speculated a possible
pathway based on hair synthesis related genes, which were also among the resulted DEGs. We hope this
explanation could provide part reason of less validity of this analysis.
12. Considering the major flaws in study design, if the authors presented the RNA-seq as an exploratory
analysis, with the qPCR as a second more stringent criterion for identifying DEGs, and then followed up
only those significant genes from qPCR in the discussion, removing all discussions of pathway analysis,
his manuscript would be more credible.
Answer: Thanks for the good suggestion and comments. To extend the result of this research, we
ransferred in the revised version the deduced pathway to the discussion part, aiming to avoid the lack of
credibility.
13. Please describe in detail the sample classification and trait classification conditions, and refer to the
picture description. The experimental method described in this paper is too simple to describe, and there is
he possibility of plagiarism.
Answer: Thanks for the good suggestion. We have presented one of the original pictures of the
experimental goats. Our research group could be the only one to research on the trait of brush hair
production. Our group published some paper on this trait and we had little reference from literature by
other researchers.
14. How to sample collection, how to carry the dermis layer? Or hair follicle tissue separation? In addition
o the description of the text, and reference to the picture description
Answer: Thanks for directing our missing information. We have added the text of skin sampling. The six
ams were removed hair after local anaesthesia, the skin tissues around 2 cm2 on the cervical carina region
were cut by scalpel and stored at -196<U+2103> as soon. In this research, we separated the skin tissues, but not
urther separated the dermis layer or hair follicle tissue.
15. For animal ethics, please provide proof of the original material of University.
Answer: Thanks for the good suggestion. We have added the original certificate of goat experiment granted
by the university ethics committee.
16. The discussion part is too shallow to explain this physiological phenomenon. Please rewrite the
discussion section.
Answer: Thanks for the good suggestion. We have added more content in the discussion part.
17. The language needs to be heavy re-modified.
Answer: Thanks for directing our weak point in the language. After the revision in the experiment text, We
have consulted a senior research from USA to re-modify the whole paper in language.
