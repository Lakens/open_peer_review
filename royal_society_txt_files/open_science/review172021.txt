Although the silica nanomaterials are well known as highly adsorbent materials, this study, for
the first time, compared the different conditions for preparation of silica nanomaterials and their
influence on the physical and surface properties. A correlation between this properties and the
uptake capacity has been also evaluated.
The experimental part is well designed and the results are well discussed. The results confirmed
the applicability of the silica nanomaterials in effective filtration and purification systems either
in batch and column modes.
In general, the paper is well written and the language is acceptable and recommended for
publication.

Dear Dr Morsi:
Title: Nano-Structured Mesoporous Silica: Influence of the Preparation Conditions on the
Physical Surface Properties for Organic Dye Uptake Efficiency
Manuscript ID: RSOS-172021
Thank you for submitting the above manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. On behalf of the
Editors and the Royal Society of Chemistry, I am pleased to inform you that your manuscript will
be accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science subject to minor revision in accordance
with the referee suggestions. Please find the reviewers' comments at the end of this email.
The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript.

Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days (i.e. by the 10-Feb-2018). If you do not think
you will be able to meet this date please let me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Comments for Manuscript RSOS-172021 Nano-Structured Mesoporous Silica: Influence of
the Preparation Conditions on the Physical Surface Properties for Organic Dye Uptake
Efficiency
This article is an excellent comparative study describes the surface physical properties of
series of ordered mesoporous silica materials correlated to the preparation condition. The
three different categories of silica materials were prepared and characterized chemically,
physically and thermally. The adsorption behavior was studied by examining Methylene
blue adsorption kinetics and isotherms on the prepared mesoporous silica particles.
I recommend the manuscript for publication after little adjustments.
Introduction
It is a comprehensive introduction which includes a wide range of interesting information.
Nevertheless, the font format needs to be unified.
Page 5 line16 there are lakes, the correction lack
Experimental Part
It is descriptive for the research methodology and characterization. Yet, the following note
should be taken in consideration:
*There are mistakes in writing the equations subscript, for example;
Page 8 line 45 equation1
line 51 equation2
Page 18 line 25 equation7
Page 18 line 10 equation8
*The formula of the following equation need to be checked;
Page 17 line 20
Results
This section is written very well and the results are of interest, however; I suggest clarifying
the following:
 Tables were not included in the manuscript, but it was managed to extract data
from the text or figured out from accompanied figures, even though, it was hard
because of the figure resolution (fig 12).
 The section start from Page 14 line54 to page 15 line7 reveals interesting results, it
would be better to emphasize the role played by dye structure, the cationic dye,
which is appeared in Fig 8 Correlation between the uptake capacity and the pore
volume and Zeta potential.
Reference
The references are more than sufficient and up to date. However, some of them need
minor corrections.
