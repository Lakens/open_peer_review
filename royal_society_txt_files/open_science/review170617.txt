Comments on Madden & Perkins
This paper presents analyses of the frequency of road-killed pheasants in the UK during a period
before and after mass release of pheasants. Because farming practice, hunting patterns, release
patterns and traffic behavior and volume have all changed, the data are not easy to interpret.
The authors present a number of alternative explanations for their results, and the relative role of
different factors affecting road mortality is carefully presented and discussed. The sample sizes
are very large, the analyses well done, and the findings well worth reporting and of general
interest.
Major comments:
1. Effects of farming practice. The authors allude to this problem. However, there is strong effects
of changes in farming practice due to UK and EU legislation. This needs to be discussed.
2. Evolutionary changes. Brown and Brown, Current Biology 23:R233-R234, 2013, showed that
traffic mortality decreased and flight morphology increased in cliff swallows. This study needs to
be cited.
3. Ethics. If so many accidents and even cases of human death are caused by pheasant release, this
raises serious questions about ethics of this human behaviour.
Other comments:
71: Already here the authors should mention which species are included in ‘pigeons’ and the
Latin names should be reported.
163: ‘affected’ implies causation. Use another phrase like ‘was correlated with’.
244: This could be due to males being more conspicuous while females are camouflage coloured.
390-393: It is difficult to distinguish between grey and black lines.
395: Please define ‘all birds’ here.

Dear Editor,
We are grateful for the positive comments and suggestions provided by the two reviewers. We have
addressed all the points raised and detailed our responses below prefixed by ##. We have also
added colour to our figures which helps their interpretation.
We look forward to hearing of your decision.
Yours truly,

This paper presents analyses of the frequency of road-killed pheasants in the UK during a period
before and after mass release of pheasants. Because farming practice, hunting patterns, release
patterns and traffic behavior and volume have all changed, the data are not easy to interpret.
The authors present a number of alternative explanations for their results, and the relative role of
different factors affecting road mortality is carefully presented and discussed. The sample sizes are
very large, the analyses well done, and the findings well worth reporting and of general interest.
Major comments:
1. Effects of farming practice. The authors allude to this problem. However, there is strong effects of
changes in farming practice due to UK and EU legislation. This needs to be discussed.
## Although our analysis of land use is within a single time period (2016) rather than a comparison
across times (so for this analysis the effects of changed agricultural practice are negligible), we
agree that this is more generally a good point. Consequently we have added caveats throughout
the MS to alert the reader to the fact that there is likely a complex interplay between changes in
game management AND agricultural practice over this period.
2. Evolutionary changes. Brown and Brown, Current Biology 23:R233-R234, 2013, showed that traffic
mortality decreased and flight morphology increased in cliff swallows. This study needs to be cited.
## We have added a paragraph to discuss the possibility that the change we observed is an
evolutionary one (l339-345) and cited this study here.
3. Ethics. If so many accidents and even cases of human death are caused by pheasant release, this
raises serious questions about ethics of this human behaviour.
## We agree, and hope that this paper will highlight some of the risks associated with intensive
pheasant release.
Other comments:
71: Already here the authors should mention which species are included in ‘pigeons’ and the Latin
names should be reported.
## Added at l97-98
163: ‘affected’ implies causation. Use another phrase like ‘was correlated with’.
## Changed to ‘was related to’
244: This could be due to males being more conspicuous while females are camouflage coloured.
## Added lines 314-317 ‘This gross difference in the reporting of sexes killed may partly be due to
the conspicuous plumage of male pheasants being easier to detect and identify. However,
although females may be cryptic in natural woodland, both sexes stand out against a tarmac
background.’
390-393: It is difficult to distinguish between grey and black lines.
## We are willing to change these lines to colour if that is acceptable to the Editors. We have
included revised colour versions of our Figures.
395: Please define ‘all birds’ here.
## Changed to ‘the total number of birds’
413: Erritzøe, Møller.
## Changed
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
Line 32-33: Not relevant. Doesn’t belong in a scientific manuscript.
## Removed
Line 33-34: 65 accidents per year across what time period?
## Added 1999-2003. Further details are provided in the reference (1) cited to support this
statement.
Line 51: reference for average weights of pheasants by sex.
## Added a citation of Reference 8 (Hill & Robertson 1988)
Line 93: using ad hoc data is unreliable and likely to greatly underestimate actual mortality figures.
## We accept this, but we are making a comparison of patterns of relative mortality rather than
absolute rates of deaths in this study. Thus, unless ad hoc sampling is biased, specifically with bias
associated with time, rather than simply noisy or imprecise, we consider such data to be
appropriate for use in the forms of analysis that we deploy with the caveats that we detail in l108-
147.
Line 99: what geographical area did these studies span? Are they comparable in terms of
infrastructure, road usage etc? more detail is required.
## We have described how the Project Splatter data were collected from across the UK. The data
reported in refs 14, 18 & 19 were collected from both national and regional surveys within the UK.
We have now clarified this (l103-104). Full details of the methods and study areas are available in
the cited papers.
Lines 177 & 186: 13 times greater in 1960’s, 11.9 in 2010 – virtually no difference.
## We agree, and in l255 we state that reporting rates remained consistent from the 1960s-2010s
at 12-13 times that expected.
