This is reviewer 3. The paper reads much better and is well structured now. I still have two minor
comments and a concern regarding one of my former questions.
Comment:
- Fig. 2b still lacks the legend and Colormap
- Use a more recent reference rather than 34.
Concern regarding my Question 4.:
Now that you have very well discussed the importance of each metric, it is more clear why they
should have quantified for all 14 arteries. However, despite explaining the importance of each
specific metric, their outcome for the experiments, their interpretation and use for this research
are NOT discussed at all. For instance, RRT and tSS were introduced in methods and just
mentioned to be increased/decreased in results part. What is the conclusion? Why don't you
discuss about these metrics and how they are beneficial for this work? Same holds for most of
other metrics except the common OSI and WSS. My question in previous review was not
answered at all. The added paragraph in the discussion part solely introduces metrics, and does
not interpret and discuss the significance, use and benefit of those metrics for this research.

sponse to Reviewers
are very pleased that we have previously addressed most of the reviewers’
cerns. All reviewers gave great feedback that led to a substantially revised
nuscript, resubmitted to Royal Society Open Science. We would also like to
ticularly thank Reviewer 3 for their meticulous re-read of our re-submitted manuscript
d identification of a few more points for improvement. We have now addressed these
nts as detailed below in red. Changes to the paper are highlighted.

mment:
g. 2b still lacks the legend and Colormap
anks very much for pointing this out – we had the colormap in our original
mission, but it somehow got dropped out when we developed the new versions of
figure for the previous submission. We have now re-added the colormap (and label).
e legend for all parts of Figure 2 (a, b, c) was correctly included in the last submission
d remains unchanged for this submission.
se a more recent reference rather than 34.
have replaced reference 34 (Knight et al., 2010) with two references: (1) Rikhtegar
al., 2012 and (2) De Wilde et al., 2016.
ncern regarding my Question 4.:
w that you have very well discussed the importance of each metric, it is more clear
y they should have quantified for all 14 arteries. However, despite explaining the
ortance of each specific metric, their outcome for the experiments, their
rpretation and use for this research are NOT discussed at all. For instance, RRT
d tSS were introduced in methods and just mentioned to be increased/decreased in
ults part. What is the conclusion? Why don't you discuss about these metrics and
w they are beneficial for this work? Same holds for most of other metrics except the
mmon OSI and WSS. My question in previous review was not answered at all. The
ded paragraph in the discussion part solely introduces metrics, and does not interpret
d discuss the significance, use and benefit of those metrics for this research.
anks, this is a good point. Although this is more of a descriptive study, we agree that
etter interpretation of the results would be beneficial. We have now expanded our
cussion towards this end (new paragraphs 4 to 6), including a Conclusion section.
