In this manuscript Suzuki and Kutsukake study the role of willow tits in the fission-fusion of
mixed species flocks. In general the paper is fairly well written and the results are clear and
sufficiently well analysed. It is found that willow tits are more likely to call when they have just
arrived at a food patch, before consuming rather than caching food and when conspecifics and
heterospecifics are not present. Caching is more likely as the number of visits to the same food
patch grows but is not affected by the presence of conspecifics or heterospecifics. Experimental
playbacks of willow tit calls result in more individuals (of multiple species) to be attracted and
stay for longer compared to control playbacks of background noise.
I do have some concerns that I highlight below along with some minor comments that I hope can
improve the manuscript.
Firstly,
I feel an improved distinction needs to be made between the results/contribution of this
manuscript and that of previous work on the same study system – Suzuki et al 2011 Long-
Distance Calling by the Willow Tit, Poecile montanus, Facilitates Formation of Mixed-Species
Foraging Flocks (available: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-
0310.2011.01982.x/full)
To me (and I have only read the original paper superficially), many of the results presented seem
very similar to this and it seems important that there is greater discussion of the differences
between the two and what this second manuscript adds to the original one in order for this
manuscript to be considered a valuable addition to the literature in its own right.
Secondly,
In the abstract, introduction and discussion the story is very much framed that this manuscript
provides evidence for willow tit calling to be important in the fission and fusion of mixed species
flocks. While the latter is well supported by the results, I find the evidence for the role of willow
tit vocalisations in the fission of flocks to be negligible and thus these conclusions not to be
supported by the results presented. Simply because individuals stop calling when other
individuals have turned up or when they are caching food will not necessarily result in the fission
of foraging groups. Further unlike the case for fusion where a follow up playback experiment
demonstrated how calling resulted in recruitment, there was no demonstration that this cessation
of calling affected the behaviour of other individuals.
Therefore, I would change how this manuscript is framed to better reflect the fact that yes calling
behaviour is temporally dynamic and related to the social environment and individual behaviour
but perhaps wait until the discussion to suggest that this could contribute to fission of flocks and
further work is required to investigate its impact.
Thirdly,
I feel that more of the concepts involved in mixed-species flocks and previous work in this area
should be introduced and especially discussed alongside the current results. Currently the results
are only placed in the context of this wider literature briefly (e.g. L219), despite there being
several studies that have explored very similar ideas in a range of species.
More minor comments:
L15-L17: This opening sentence is a bit awkward/complex. Suggest rephrasing with the same
content
L19: Suggest deleting songbird
L22: See major point above – No results are presented to show that stopping calling results in
fission of flocks
L41: Suggest deleting finely
3
L47-L49: I would avoid saying that the behaviour is costly as this creates an evolutionary
dilemma (at this point it has not be made clear that there are benefits too). A better wording may
be to say that “there are costs associated with this behaviour such as…”
L49-L54: The structure/order of this small section should be improved
L57 (and throughout): Would suggest an alternative to suppress – why not just stop?
L58: It feels like there is a word missing/mistype in this line
L67-75: Would suggest introducing the feeders in this section too
L75: Is there a reference for these last stats.
L79: A number of birds captured and proportion of observed birds that were ringed would be
helpful here if available
L95-L97: Not clear how this was worked out? Could observations be easily made on individuals
that flew a considerable distance?
L97: Would suggest rewording this to “…were added to video recordings using an…”
L124: How was 15m decided upon and how was it measured?
L126: Why were background noise treatments played at a different number of dBs to
experimental treatment
L133-L147: Would strongly suggest changing the order that the two GLMMs are introduced in to
match the order that they are presented in the tables/results – it also makes more sense that way
as well.
L133-147: Would suggest changing the way that the models are introduced, currently it is not
very clear. E.g. In the first model, the subsequent foraging behaviour (consume or cache) was
modelled in response to number of feeder visitations, calling behaviour (yes/no) and the
presence or absence of conspecifics and heterospecifics.
L143-L144: Would suggest rephrasing this to make more clear
L145: Need to explain how fixed terms were standardized
L146-147: The random effects structure of the model is not clear to me from this sentence. What
are “individual trials” compared to “individual identitiy”?
L148-L149: What statistical test was used when you refer to “median tests” – need to be more
specific
L162: Suppress doesn’t fit here very well (as per previous comment). Use “were less likely”
instead?
L179: Suggest “…and these calls were separately shown to facilitate the cohesion..”
L184: I don’t see how these results support this conclusion about movement from the patch
L198-L204: a) Currently this sentence is incredibly long and needs splitting up and b) it contains
some bold statements that aren’t referenced – I would like to see the explanation made more
general and discussed more in context
L211: Delete apparently
L222-L224: Suggest rewriting this sentence as is too long/hard to follow as it stands
L226: Insert more between by and dominant
L228-230: Would suggest rewriting this concluding sentence to be slightly less overstated and
more reflective of the findings

Noisy feeding and silent caching: foraging decisions influence fission-fusion dynamics of mixed-
species bird flocks
#########
The authors present observational and experimental data on Parid vocalisations while foraging in
mixed-species flocks to investigate the influence of individuals’ decisions on group-level
outcome. They analyse calling and foraging behaviour of willow tits upon discovery of feeding
sites, and find that willow tits usually call before taking a seed for consumption, but generally
don’t call when taking a seed for subsequent caching. Over the course of repeated feeder visits,
and with other flock members arriving at the feeder, willow tits shift from consumption to
caching. Playbacks of willow tit calls attracted both conspecific and heterospecific flock members,
and repeated calls alone (no food was provided in these trials) seem to have provided an
incentive for the birds to stay near the speaker for a few minutes.
The paper presents nice observational data coupled with an interesting experiment. Together,
these provide some valuable insights into the social ecology of mixed-species groups and
dynamic decision-making. However, we were not convinced with all of the conclusions drawn
from the results. We felt that the results could be reported and interpreted more carefully, in
particular drawing conclusions on (i) the effect of vocalisations by willow tits on fission-fusion
dynamics, and (ii) the intentionality of having such effects. Whilst the authors do show
differences in the amount of time that flocks remain present at a feeder under different
conditions, they have no evidence about what happens to the flock once it leaves the observation
area. They cannot say whether the flocks did indeed fission or not. Thus, much of the
introduction and discussion of the paper seem to be drawing too great conclusions given the
data. Further, the authors often describe the behaviour of willow tits as if they were actively
controlling flocking behaviour. For example, from the results from the playback experiment the
authors suggest that ‘willow tits were able to finely adjust the cohesion of mixed-species flocks’
(line 190/191), and willow tits actively induce fission of flocks when caching seeds silently
(nominally to reduce the risk of pilferage). However, from the data presented it can’t be
concluded that the absence of calls leads to fission of flocks, and an alternative explanations for
willow tits to stop calling when a flock has been established and it is safe for them to pay
attention to caching.
Overall, the interpretation of the results as evidence for ‘previously unknown influence of
individuals' foraging decisions on the fission-fusion dynamics of mixed-species flocks’ (Line
177/178) are not supported by the data. The paper should instead focus on the fact that willow
tits can adjust their individual foraging decision (feeding versus caching) and calling behaviour
5
according their social environment, and perhaps have some influence on building up the number
of individuals in the flock (via recruitment, as shown by the authors’ previous work).
Besides the broad concern with over-extending what can be drawn from the results and
occasional lack of clarity about its scope, the paper is enjoyable to read. It is a solid experiment
with interesting results that represent a distinct contribution to the literature.
Damien Farine & Friederike Hillemann
Specific comments:
Introduction
Line 35-37. Consider rephrasing to clarify what is meant here and what the contradiction refers
to.
Line 41. Provide a brief definition of ‘fission-fusion dynamics’, given the broad scope of Royal
Society Open Science.
Line 50 and line 181. Reference [19], Hamilton’s model on selfish herd dynamics, doesn’t seem an
appropriate citation here. Maybe use a more general reference, such as Krause & Ruxton, Living
in Groups, 2002.
Line 54. ‘Overall, the fine adjustments of flock cohesion, according to foraging decisions, may be
advantageous for willow tits.’ – this would benefit from rephrasing for clarity. Does it mean
‘foraging in mixed-species flocks appears to be generally beneficial for willow tits’, or ‘willow tits
would benefit from being able to influence flock cohesion’?
Methods
Use either passive or active voice throughout the methods section.
Line 87. Why did the observational sessions last for ‘approximately 10 min’? Did the authors
follow each focal individual until it visited the feeder 10 times, which took about 10 minutes, or
what was the criterion to end a trial?
Line 88-90. This belongs into the results section.
Line 95. ‘We considered these instances as caching’ - What’s the percentage of feeder visitations
that this definition applies to?
Line 97. ‘were never observed to consume it.’ - Is this unpublished data or personal observation?
Please indicate.
Line 101. ‘Data from 13 sites, in which willow tits never visited the feeder’ - I am surprised that in
a quarter of all trials no willow tit visited the feeder, given that they were within only 15m. Can
the authors comment on these trials? Do they think that the birds didn’t see the feeder, or did it
take them longer then 10 minutes to approach it?
Line 106. How many feeder visitations were recorded by other species?
Line 109-110: ’to test whether the recruitment calls of willow tits function to attract flock
members’ - Isn’t that per definition the function of these calls? Also, it has been neatly
demonstrated in Suzuki 2012 Ethology, reference [16]. The authors could choose to be a bit more
forthright about their previous work and how this work extends their previous work. It seems to
be sufficient new results to warrant a follow-up paper, but it would probably also improve the
visibility of the previous work if the current manuscript built more clearly on it.
6
Lines 112-113. In treatment (ii) the authors do not simulate the presence of a willow tit at all,
therefore this shouldn’t be considered a simulation of the presence of a non-calling willow tit, as
opposed to treatment (i), the simulation of the presence of a calling willow tit. Treatment (ii)
would be better referred to as a control or background noise.
Line 122. Give details about the distance of the loudspeaker from the flock. This would clarify
whether the individuals that were counted within 15m of the loudspeaker actively approached
the speaker from a larger distance.
Line 127. ‘separated by at least 400 m to ensure independence of the data [16]’ - From the
reference provided, it is not clear how this should ensure independence of the data.
Line 133 Statistical analysis. - From the two models used to investigate the relationship between
the calling and foraging behaviours of willow tits, it is not clear what the main research question
is. Currently, there are potentially circular statements, such as ‘There was a significant effect of
the subsequent foraging behaviour on the probability of calling’ (Line 159), and ‘The subsequent
foraging behaviour was affected by the calling decision’ (Line 163/164). The dependent variable
should be determined by the research question, and only ecologically relevant factors should be
included as fixed effects.
Line 143. Additionally to the variance inflation factor (VIF), it would be good to see actual
correlation of fixed effect factors. Not only is this generally good practice, but it is also interesting
biology.
Results and Discussion
The data do not provide any evidence that recruitment calls maintain cohesion or stability of
flocks (lines 167-168, line 179, and line 226-228). The mere playback of recruitment calls, i.e.
without supplying food, effectively keeps more birds longer near the speaker, compared to a
playback of background noise, but there is no evidence that flocks fission in the absence of calls.
Further, there is no support for the claim that ‘recruitment calling (...) serves to coordinate the
fission and fusion of mixed-species bird flocks’ (line 222-223). While, arguably, the so-called
recruitment calls facilitate the fusion of flocks by attracting both conspecifics and heterospecifics
(references: this study, and [16]), there is no evidence that willow tits actively coordinate the
fission of foraging flocks - either by calling, nor by not-calling. The most parsimonious hypothesis
is probably that willow tits recruit heterospecifics to food resources that are larger than they can
access alone (per Elgar’s work with sparrows) and do so in order to be able to devote greater
attention to caching due to the increased vigilance for predators.
The authors continue to suggest that willow tits actively induce fission of flocks when reducing
or stopping to call (line 226-228: ‘can actively adjust the social cohesiveness of the flocks by
producing vocalizations’). They argue that willow tits ‘tend to be silent while caching food items,
leading to the fission of flocks’ (Abstract, line 22), which then decreases the risk of pilferage (line
183-186). This argument doesn’t seem sound for a few reasons. First of all, there is no evidence
that the absence of calls leads to fission of flocks. Secondly, willow tits probably reduce the risk of
pilferage by caching silent and solitarily. Thirdly, willow tits may stop calling because there is no
need for attracting more birds once a flock has been established. This is why the term
‘suppression of calls’, used in this context throughout the manuscript, is problematic.
Lines 203-208. If willow tits consume food just before the arrival of flock members to avoid
competition, they should also cache food prior to arrival of flock members, as either action
requires taking a seed. Generally, one could probably assume that the competition for seeds is
relatively low, given that food is provided in a big open tray, allowing several birds to feed
simultaneously, and birds usually take a seed and leave the site, to process the seed in a
tree/bush nearby.
7
Lines 214-221. This paragraph seems rather speculative regarding the objectives of this paper.
Line 226. There is no contrast between previous studies suggesting that mixed-species flocks form
through heterospecifics following each other, and the findings reported here that recruitment
calls of willow tits attract both conspecifics and heterospecifics to facilitate formation of mixed-
species flocks in this way. Again here, the data do not allow making statements on the ‘social
cohesiveness of the flock’.
Finally, it would be useful if the authors would comment on the relative importance of individual
predictors in the GLMM. The authors make the effort to standardise their measures, but they
never report on the effect sizes.
Minor corrections:
Line 18. Remove hyphen in ‘short-time scale’.
Line 39. Remove redundant ‘away’.
Line 41. Replace ‘finely’ with either ‘specifically’, or ‘precisely’.
Line 49. Remove ‘help the tits to’.
Line 57. Replace ‘coexist’ with ‘occur’.
Line 58. Should be ‘caching’.
Line 86. Replace ‘measure’ with ‘record’.
Line 87. The authors might want to change ‘the first author’ to ‘the experimenter’, according to
common standard.
Line 104. Replace ‘at all trials’ with ‘in all trials’.
Line 112. Remove ‘while consuming food items’.
Line 126. Add ‘a’ to ‘measured at (a) distance of 1 m’.
Line 155. Change to ‘discovery of a new feeder’.
Line 157. Replace ‘shifted’ with ‘did’, and adjust the other verbs accordingly.
Line 168. Add ‘the’ to ‘first 1.5 min of (the) playback’.
Line 182. Replace ‘during’ with ‘before’.
Line 203. Add reference for dominance relationships.
Line 209 et seq. Why not cite reference 16 here?
Line 211. Replace ‘apparently allows’ with ‚may allow’.
Line 228. Should be either individuals’, or an individual's.
Tables. Intuitively, the results from the first model are expected to be reported in Table 1, and the
results from the second model in table 2, respectively.

Comments to the Author(s)
In this manuscript Suzuki and Kutsukake study the role of willow tits in the fission-fusion of
mixed species flocks. In general the paper is fairly well written and the results are clear and
sufficiently well analysed. It is found that willow tits are more likely to call when they have just
arrived at a food patch, before consuming rather than caching food and when conspecifics and
heterospecifics are not present. Caching is more likely as the number of visits to the same food
patch grows but is not affected by the presence of conspecifics or heterospecifics. Experimental
playbacks of willow tit calls result in more individuals (of multiple species) to be attracted and
stay for longer compared to control playbacks of background noise.
I do have some concerns that I highlight below along with some minor comments that I hope can
improve the manuscript.
Firstly,
I feel an improved distinction needs to be made between the results/contribution of this
manuscript and that of previous work on the same study system – Suzuki et al 2011 Long-
Distance Calling by the Willow Tit, Poecile montanus, Facilitates Formation of Mixed-Species
Foraging Flocks (available: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-
0310.2011.01982.x/full)
To me (and I have only read the original paper superficially), many of the results presented seem
very similar to this and it seems important that there is greater discussion of the differences
between the two and what this second manuscript adds to the original one in order for this
manuscript to be considered a valuable addition to the literature in its own right.
Secondly,
In the abstract, introduction and discussion the story is very much framed that this manuscript
provides evidence for willow tit calling to be important in the fission and fusion of mixed species
flocks. While the latter is well supported by the results, I find the evidence for the role of willow
9
tit vocalisations in the fission of flocks to be negligible and thus these conclusions not to be
supported by the results presented. Simply because individuals stop calling when other
individuals have turned up or when they are caching food will not necessarily result in the fission
of foraging groups. Further unlike the case for fusion where a follow up playback experiment
demonstrated how calling resulted in recruitment, there was no demonstration that this cessation
of calling affected the behaviour of other individuals.
Therefore, I would change how this manuscript is framed to better reflect the fact that yes calling
behaviour is temporally dynamic and related to the social environment and individual behaviour
but perhaps wait until the discussion to suggest that this could contribute to fission of flocks and
further work is required to investigate its impact.
Thirdly,
I feel that more of the concepts involved in mixed-species flocks and previous work in this area
should be introduced and especially discussed alongside the current results. Currently the results
are only placed in the context of this wider literature briefly (e.g. L219), despite there being
several studies that have explored very similar ideas in a range of species.
More minor comments:
L15-L17: This opening sentence is a bit awkward/complex. Suggest rephrasing with the same
content
L19: Suggest deleting songbird
L22: See major point above – No results are presented to show that stopping calling results in
fission of flocks
L41: Suggest deleting finely
L47-L49: I would avoid saying that the behaviour is costly as this creates an evolutionary
dilemma (at this point it has not be made clear that there are benefits too). A better wording may
be to say that “there are costs associated with this behaviour such as…”
L49-L54: The structure/order of this small section should be improved
L57 (and throughout): Would suggest an alternative to suppress – why not just stop?
L58: It feels like there is a word missing/mistype in this line
L67-75: Would suggest introducing the feeders in this section too
L75: Is there a reference for these last stats.
L79: A number of birds captured and proportion of observed birds that were ringed would be
helpful here if available
L95-L97: Not clear how this was worked out? Could observations be easily made on individuals
that flew a considerable distance?
L97: Would suggest rewording this to “…were added to video recordings using an…”
L124: How was 15m decided upon and how was it measured?
L126: Why were background noise treatments played at a different number of dBs to
experimental treatment
L133-L147: Would strongly suggest changing the order that the two GLMMs are introduced in to
match the order that they are presented in the tables/results – it also makes more sense that way
as well.
L133-147: Would suggest changing the way that the models are introduced, currently it is not
very clear. E.g. In the first model, the subsequent foraging behaviour (consume or cache) was
modelled in response to number of feeder visitations, calling behaviour (yes/no) and the
presence or absence of conspecifics and heterospecifics.
L143-L144: Would suggest rephrasing this to make more clear
L145: Need to explain how fixed terms were standardized
L146-147: The random effects structure of the model is not clear to me from this sentence. What
are “individual trials” compared to “individual identitiy”?
L148-L149: What statistical test was used when you refer to “median tests” – need to be more
specific
L162: Suppress doesn’t fit here very well (as per previous comment). Use “were less likely”
instead?
L179: Suggest “…and these calls were separately shown to facilitate the cohesion..”
10
L184: I don’t see how these results support this conclusion about movement from the patch
L198-L204: a) Currently this sentence is incredibly long and needs splitting up and b) it contains
some bold statements that aren’t referenced – I would like to see the explanation made more
general and discussed more in context
L211: Delete apparently
L222-L224: Suggest rewriting this sentence as is too long/hard to follow as it stands
L226: Insert more between by and dominant
L228-230: Would suggest rewriting this concluding sentence to be slightly less overstated and

Noisy feeding and silent caching: foraging decisions influence fission-fusion dynamics of mixed-

#########
The authors present observational and experimental data on Parid vocalisations while foraging in
mixed-species flocks to investigate the influence of individuals’ decisions on group-level
outcome. They analyse calling and foraging behaviour of willow tits upon discovery of feeding
sites, and find that willow tits usually call before taking a seed for consumption, but generally
don’t call when taking a seed for subsequent caching. Over the course of repeated feeder visits,
and with other flock members arriving at the feeder, willow tits shift from consumption to
caching. Playbacks of willow tit calls attracted both conspecific and heterospecific flock members,
and repeated calls alone (no food was provided in these trials) seem to have provided an
incentive for the birds to stay near the speaker for a few minutes.
The paper presents nice observational data coupled with an interesting experiment. Together,

Line 101. ‘Data from 13 sites, in which willow tits never visited the feeder’ - I am surprised that in
a quarter of all trials no willow tit visited the feeder, given that they were within only 15m. Can
the authors comment on these trials? Do they think that the birds didn’t see the feeder, or did it
take them longer then 10 minutes to approach it?
Line 106. How many feeder visitations were recorded by other species?
Line 109-110: ’to test whether the recruitment calls of willow tits function to attract flock
members’ - Isn’t that per definition the function of these calls? Also, it has been neatly
demonstrated in Suzuki 2012 Ethology, reference [16]. The authors could choose to be a bit more
forthright about their previous work and how this work extends their previous work. It seems to
be sufficient new results to warrant a follow-up paper, but it would probably also improve the
visibility of the previous work if the current manuscript built more clearly on it.
12
Lines 112-113. In treatment (ii) the authors do not simulate the presence of a willow tit at all,
therefore this shouldn’t be considered a simulation of the presence of a non-calling willow tit, as
opposed to treatment (i), the simulation of the presence of a calling willow tit. Treatment (ii)
would be better referred to as a control or background noise.
Line 122. Give details about the distance of the loudspeaker from the flock. This would clarify
whether the individuals that were counted within 15m of the loudspeaker actively approached
the speaker from a larger distance.
Line 127. ‘separated by at least 400 m to ensure independence of the data [16]’ - From the
reference provided, it is not clear how this should ensure independence of the data.
Line 133 Statistical analysis. - From the two models used to investigate the relationship between
the calling and foraging behaviours of willow tits, it is not clear what the main research question
is. Currently, there are potentially circular statements, such as ‘There was a significant effect of
the subsequent foraging behaviour on the probability of calling’ (Line 159), and ‘The subsequent
foraging behaviour was affected by the calling decision’ (Line 163/164). The dependent variable
should be determined by the research question, and only ecologically relevant factors should be
included as fixed effects.
Line 143. Additionally to the variance inflation factor (VIF), it would be good to see actual
correlation of fixed effect factors. Not only is this generally good practice, but it is also interesting
biology.
Results and Discussion
The data do not provide any evidence that recruitment calls maintain cohesion or stability of
flocks (lines 167-168, line 179, and line 226-228). The mere playback of recruitment calls, i.e.
without supplying food, effectively keeps more birds longer near the speaker, compared to a
playback of background noise, but there is no evidence that flocks fission in the absence of calls.
Further, there is no support for the claim that ‘recruitment calling (...) serves to coordinate the
fission and fusion of mixed-species bird flocks’ (line 222-223). While, arguably, the so-called
recruitment calls facilitate the fusion of flocks by attracting both conspecifics and heterospecifics
(references: this study, and [16]), there is no evidence that willow tits actively coordinate the
fission of foraging flocks - either by calling, nor by not-calling. The most parsimonious hypothesis
is probably that willow tits recruit heterospecifics to food resources that are larger than they can
access alone (per Elgar’s work with sparrows) and do so in order to be able to devote greater
attention to caching due to the increased vigilance for predators.
The authors continue to suggest that willow tits actively induce fission of flocks when reducing
or stopping to call (line 226-228: ‘can actively adjust the social cohesiveness of the flocks by
producing vocalizations’). They argue that willow tits ‘tend to be silent while caching food items,
leading to the fission of flocks’ (Abstract, line 22), which then decreases the risk of pilferage (line
183-186). This argument doesn’t seem sound for a few reasons. First of all, there is no evidence
that the absence of calls leads to fission of flocks. Secondly, willow tits probably reduce the risk of
pilferage by caching silent and solitarily. Thirdly, willow tits may stop calling because there is no
need for attracting more birds once a flock has been established. This is why the term
‘suppression of calls’, used in this context throughout the manuscript, is problematic.
Lines 203-208. If willow tits consume food just before the arrival of flock members to avoid
competition, they should also cache food prior to arrival of flock members, as either action
requires taking a seed. Generally, one could probably assume that the competition for seeds is
relatively low, given that food is provided in a big open tray, allowing several birds to feed
simultaneously, and birds usually take a seed and leave the site, to process the seed in a
tree/bush nearby.
13
Lines 214-221. This paragraph seems rather speculative regarding the objectives of this paper.
Line 226. There is no contrast between previous studies suggesting that mixed-species flocks form
through heterospecifics following each other, and the findings reported here that recruitment
calls of willow tits attract both conspecifics and heterospecifics to facilitate formation of mixed-
species flocks in this way. Again here, the data do not allow making statements on the ‘social
cohesiveness of the flock’.
Finally, it would be useful if the authors would comment on the relative importance of individual
predictors in the GLMM. The authors make the effort to standardise their measures, but they
never report on the effect sizes.
Minor corrections:
Line 18. Remove hyphen in ‘short-time scale’.
Line 39. Remove redundant ‘away’.
Line 41. Replace ‘finely’ with either ‘specifically’, or ‘precisely’.
Line 49. Remove ‘help the tits to’.
Line 57. Replace ‘coexist’ with ‘occur’.
Line 58. Should be ‘caching’.
Line 86. Replace ‘measure’ with ‘record’.
Line 87. The authors might want to change ‘the first author’ to ‘the experimenter’, according to
common standard.
Line 104. Replace ‘at all trials’ with ‘in all trials’.
Line 112. Remove ‘while consuming food items’.
Line 126. Add ‘a’ to ‘measured at (a) distance of 1 m’.
Line 155. Change to ‘discovery of a new feeder’.
Line 157. Replace ‘shifted’ with ‘did’, and adjust the other verbs accordingly.
Line 168. Add ‘the’ to ‘first 1.5 min of (the) playback’.
Line 182. Replace ‘during’ with ‘before’.
Line 203. Add reference for dominance relationships.
Line 209 et seq. Why not cite reference 16 here?
Line 211. Replace ‘apparently allows’ with ‚may allow’.
Line 228. Should be either individuals’, or an individual's.
Tables. Intuitively, the results from the first model are expected to be reported in Table 1, and the
results from the second model in table 2, respectively.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The current version of the manuscript is much improved from the version I previously reviewed
and I enjoyed having the chance to look at it again. However, I still have a fewer minor comments
that I feel the authors should address before it is suitable for publication.
Title:
The title as it stands is quite long and I wouldn’t mind seeing the authors attempt to write a
shorter version perhaps without the colon
Abstract:
L16-L18: This sentence is a bit awkward and should be rewritten to be clearer
Introduction:
L36-L37: I think this opening sentence needs to be stronger. The two parts of it also come in the
wrong order i.e. I would expect a (i) In order to answer this big evolutionary/ecological
question, (ii) it is important to understand…
L41: Would recommend not using “might” in this sentence and providing more citations of
when/how mixed-species flocks have been used previously
L40-L43: More generally, this sentence is a bit long and could be more to the point
L45: I don’t feel “economic” is the correct word here
L46/L47: Reword this sentence so that you don’t have to use the word “information” and can
instead use a word like knowledge or understanding. Given you are already talking about
information use in the animals, this is confusing
L50: Delete “the” before greater racket-tailed drongos
L51: This example, and its relevance, is currently quite unclear to the reader
L52-L53: The sentence starting “Drongos increase…” needs rewording to aid clarity
Methods:
L98-100: Are these results from this study? If so, please clarify
L108: Not clear to me what is meant by “an experimental site was randomly assigned in each
forest opening”
L153-163: This was the one section of the methods that I felt could be improved. I think some
though should be put into the ordering of sentences in this paragraph to make it clearer and
improve the flow
Results:
L201: I think saying that it affected the two behaviours differently is a misnomer. It was more that
one behaviour was affected and the other wasn’t. I feel this needs to be made clear here
Tables: Degrees of freedom are currently not provided, is there a reason for this? Also I think the
legend and the model terms need to contain more information to enable them to be interpreted
15
with out the main text (e.g. what is subsequent behaviour? What is meant by conspecifics and
heterospecifics – number? Presence? Etc)
Figure 2: Why is the width of the absence/presence bars different in part c) from parts b) and d)
Discussion:
L219-220: I would prefer to see a bit more expansion to the wider context in this initial paragraph
of the discussion, especially related to the ideas in these two lines
L221: Delete “Therefore,”
L232-234: This sentence needs rewording
L236-238: It would be good to see the points made at the end of this paragraph developed more
fully
L240-L243: There are some big assumptions in this bit of discussion and it feels like there may be
alternative explanations possible here too (e.g. some kind of risk-averse strategy) so it would be
nice to see some caveats to this idea
L245-247: This bit of discussion seems like an ideal opportunity to set this study in the context of
some broader ecological ideas. I would suggest that the authors expand a bit here with some
additional relevant citations
L260: “suggest vocalisations” rather than “calling behaviour”
L261: Suggest replacing “may” with “have the potential to”
L264: Suggest “vocalisations” rather than “calling behaviour”
L264-L268; I would suggest making this final sentence shorter, more to the point and less far
reaching. I would focus more explicitly on its implications for social foraging and mixed-species
groups rather than “the complex patterning of community assembly”

The authors dealt carefully with the reviewers’ comments, and addressed all concerns and
criticisms brought forward in an adequate manner. The revisions have greatly improved the
clarity of the manuscript. Especially the visual presentation of the results makes them much
easier to interpret and discussion is more comprehensive. On that note, we suggest that the
justification for not including additional analyses using more than just presence or absence is not
very strong, and that the manuscript would benefit from having this additional level of detail we
proposed in our previous comments. Although the AIC suggests that this level of detail does not
fit the data as well, that is not really the metric we are after here – instead we are after gaining a
better understanding of willow tit recruitment calling based on the state of the social
environment.
We look forward to seeing this study in print.

Manuscript ID: RSOS-160531
Dear Editor,
We are submitting a revised version of our manuscript entitled “Noisy feeding and silent caching:
foraging decisions influence the temporal dynamics of mixed-species bird flocks” for publication in
Royal Society Open Science. We believe that we have addressed all criticisms thoroughly and
completely and we hope you agree that the manuscript is much improved and is now acceptable for
publication.
We agree with most of the reviewers’ comments and revised the paper accordingly. In particular, we
revised the text (1) to avoid saying that willow tits actively stop calling to facilitate the “fission” of the
flocks and (2) to clarify the differences between our previous study (Suzuki 2012 Ethology) and the
present study. In some parts of text, we largely changed the sentences.
Sincerely and with thanks for your consideration,
Toshitaka N. Suzuki and Nobuyuki Kutsukake
Responses to Reviewers' Comments
Reviewer 1
COMMENT: I feel an improved distinction needs to be made between the results/contribution of this
manuscript and that of previous work on the same study system – Suzuki et al 2011 Long-Distance
Calling by the Willow Tit, Poecile montanus, Facilitates Formation of Mixed-Species Foraging Flocks
(available: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0310.2011.01982.x/full)
To me (and I have only read the original paper superficially), many of the results presented seem very
similar to this and it seems important that there is greater discussion of the differences between the
two and what this second manuscript adds to the original one in order for this manuscript to be
considered a valuable addition to the literature in its own right.
RESPONSE: Thank you so much for the comments. We clarified the distinction between the present
manuscript and the previous work (Suzuki 2012 Ethology) throughout the manuscript. The first paper
investigates the influence of social context on the calling behavior of willow tits, especially upon the
discovery of food source, whereas this paper finds the calling behavior is also adjusted by foraging
modes of the callers, and influences the temporal cohesion with flock members that have already
came to the foraging patch (Lines 18-24; 55-61; 81-84; 230-232).
COMMENT: In the abstract, introduction and discussion the story is very much framed that this
manuscript provides evidence for willow tit calling to be important in the fission and fusion of mixed
species flocks. While the latter is well supported by the results, I find the evidence for the role of
willow tit vocalisations in the fission of flocks to be negligible and thus these conclusions not to be
supported by the results presented. Simply because individuals stop calling when other individuals
have turned up or when they are caching food will not necessarily result in the fission of foraging
groups. Further unlike the case for fusion where a follow up playback experiment demonstrated how
calling resulted in recruitment, there was no demonstration that this cessation of calling affected the
behaviour of other individuals.
Therefore, I would change how this manuscript is framed to better reflect the fact that yes calling
behaviour is temporally dynamic and related to the social environment and individual behaviour but
perhaps wait until the discussion to suggest that this could contribute to fission of flocks and further
work is required to investigate its impact.
RESPONSE: We agree that we did not detect any mechanisms for the fission of mixed-species flocks.
Therefore, according to the suggestion, we revised the text not to mention that tits evoke the fission
of flocks throughout the manuscript. However, it is possible that other call types may also influence
the temporal dynamics of mixed-species flocks. We added this information in Discussion (Lines 252-
258) since we feel it can be an interesting issue for future work.
COMMENT: I feel that more of the concepts involved in mixed-species flocks and previous work in this
area should be introduced and especially discussed alongside the current results. Currently the results
are only placed in the context of this wider literature briefly (e.g. L219), despite there being several
studies that have explored very similar ideas in a range of species.
RESPONSE: We added further information on the mixed-species flocks in Introduction (Lines 48-54)
and discussion (Line 261-262). Especially, we introduced a study of greater racket-tailed drongos that
use vocal mimicry to attract members of mixed-species flocks (Goodale and Kotagama 2006 Anim.
Behav.).
More minor comments:
COMMENT: L15-L17: This opening sentence is a bit awkward/complex. Suggest rephrasing with the
same content
RESPONSE: Corrected (Lines 15-16).
COMMNET:L19: Suggest deleting songbird
RESPONSE: Corrected (Lines 22).
COMMNET:L22: See major point above – No results are presented to show that stopping calling results
in fission of flocks
RESPONSE: We deleted the mention on the fission of the flocks from this context too (Lines 25-26).
COMMNET:L41: Suggest deleting finely
RESPONSE: Corrected (Lines 46-47).
COMMNET:L47-L49: I would avoid saying that the behaviour is costly as this creates an evolutionary
dilemma (at this point it has not be made clear that there are benefits too). A better wording may be
to say that “there are costs associated with this behaviour such as…”
RESPONSE: We revised the text not to mention that this calling behavior is costly (Lines 55-61).
L49-L54: The structure/order of this small section should be improved
RESPONSE: We revised this section as a new paragraph to clarify our hypothesis (Lines 62-72).
COMMNET:L57 (and throughout): Would suggest an alternative to suppress – why not just stop?
RESPONSE: According to the comments by another reviewer, we revised the text not to mention that
birds suppress (or stop) calls. Instead, we used the phrases such as “birds do not produce calls” or
something similar (e.g., Line 76).
COMMNET:L58: It feels like there is a word missing/mistype in this line
RESPONSE: We clarified what this sentence means (Lines 75-81).
COMMNET:L67-75: Would suggest introducing the feeders in this section too
RESPONSE: We would like to keep not to describe the experimental feeder in this section, because we
would like to briefly introduce the study species (but not experimental protocol) and study site here
(Lines 92-100).
COMMNET:L75: Is there a reference for these last stats.
RESPONSE: The data are derived from the present study (Line 98). We would keep this information in
this section as it is not related to the main finding of this study, but may important to understand the
mixed-species flock system we studied.
COMMNET:L79: A number of birds captured and proportion of observed birds that were ringed would
be helpful here if available
RESPONSE: We added the additional information on the identification of individual birds. For willow
tits, all the individuals in the study forest had been individually color-banded. However, for other
species, we couldn’t calculate the proportion of color-banded birds since we could not count how many
birds were un-banded. So, we only give the number of individual willow tits that had been captured
(Lines 106-107).
COMMNET: L95-L97: Not clear how this was worked out? Could observations be easily made on
individuals that flew a considerable distance?
RESPONSE: We did not observe any instances that willow tits consume food items far from the feeder,
and they usually cached food items at a such distance. We found the similar observations in a
published paper showing that willow tits do always consume food items close to the feeders, whereas
they do cache food far from the feeder (Nakamura & Wako 1988 J. Yamashina Inst. Ornithol.). So, we
cited this reference in this context (Line 124).
COMMENT: L97: Would suggest rewording this to “…were added to video recordings using an…”
RESPONSE: We did not use video cameras for recording the behaviors, but we dictated the comments
to an audio recorder. We clarified this point in Line 124-125.
COMMENT: L124: How was 15m decided upon and how was it measured?
RESPONSE: We chose this distance because all birds were visible from this observation location. We
estimated the distance using a tape measure (Lines 156-159).
COMMENT: L126: Why were background noise treatments played at a different number of dBs to
experimental treatment
RESPONSE: Background noise files were prepared to be broadcast at the “same” amplitude as the
background noise level of call playbacks. We clarified this in Lines 149-152.
COMMENT: L133-L147: Would strongly suggest changing the order that the two GLMMs are introduced
in to match the order that they are presented in the tables/results – it also makes more sense that
way as well.
RESPONSE: Thank you for the comment. We changed the order of GLMMs in this section accordingly
(Lines 170ff.).
COMMENT: L133-147: Would suggest changing the way that the models are introduced, currently it is
not very clear. E.g. In the first model, the subsequent foraging behaviour (consume or cache) was
modelled in response to number of feeder visitations, calling behaviour (yes/no) and the presence or
absence of conspecifics and heterospecifics.
RESPONSE: Corrected (Lines 172-176).
COMMENT: L143-L144: Would suggest rephrasing this to make more clear
RESPONSE: Corrected (Lines 178-179).
COMMENT: L145: Need to explain how fixed terms were standardized
RESPONSE: We used z-transformation to standardize the fixed terms. Corrected (Line 182).
COMMENT: L146-147: The random effects structure of the model is not clear to me from this
sentence. What are “individual trials” compared to “individual identitiy”?
RESPONSE: We collected data from 41 trials where 13 individual willow tits visited the feeder (see
Lines 131-135). So, we included both individual trials and individual identity of tits in the model. We
clarified this point in Lines 183-184.
COMMENT: L148-L149: What statistical test was used when you refer to “median tests” – need to be
more specific
RESPONSE: We used “Mood’s median test”. Corrected (Lines 185-186).
COMMENT: L162: Suppress doesn’t fit here very well (as per previous comment). Use “were less
likely” instead?
RESPONSE: We rephrased the text accordingly (Lines 201-202).
COMMENT: L179: Suggest “…and these calls were separately shown to facilitate the cohesion..”
RESPONSE: Corrected (Lines 218-219).
COMMENT: L184: I don’t see how these results support this conclusion about movement from the
patch
RESPONSE: We agree with your comment and then revised text not to tell about the movement from
the patch throughout the manuscript.
COMMENT: L198-L204: a) Currently this sentence is incredibly long and needs splitting up and b) it
contains some bold statements that aren’t referenced – I would like to see the explanation made more
general and discussed more in context
RESPONSE: We have shortened this statement and explained why our data support the view that tits
adjust foraging modes according to their internal factors (Lines 239-247).
COMMENT: L211: Delete apparently
RESPONSE: According to the suggestion by another reviewer, we changed “apparently” with “may”
(Line 250).
COMMENT: L222-L224: Suggest rewriting this sentence as is too long/hard to follow as it stands
RESPONSE: We have shortened this sentence to make it clearer (Line 259-261).
COMMENT: L226: Insert more between by and dominant
RESPONSE: This sentence was changed according to the comments by another reviewer.
COMMENT: L228-230: Would suggest rewriting this concluding sentence to be slightly less overstated
and more reflective of the findings
RESPONSE: Agree. We toned down this sentence and revised it to be more reflective of the present
findings (Lines 261-267).
Reviewer 2
COMMENT: The paper presents nice observational data coupled with an interesting experiment.
Together, these provide some valuable insights into the social ecology of mixed-species groups and
dynamic decision-making. However, we were not convinced with all of the conclusions drawn from the
results. We felt that the results could be reported and interpreted more carefully, in particular drawing
conclusions on (i) the effect of vocalisations by willow tits on fission-fusion dynamics, and (ii) the
intentionality of having such effects. Whilst the authors do show differences in the amount of time that
flocks remain present at a feeder under different conditions, they have no evidence about what
happens to the flock once it leaves the observation area. They cannot say whether the flocks did
indeed fission or not. Thus, much of the introduction and discussion of the paper seem to be drawing
too great conclusions given the data. Further, the authors often describe the behaviour of willow tits
as if they were actively controlling flocking behaviour. For example, from the results from the playback
experiment the authors suggest that ‘willow tits were able to finely adjust the cohesion of mixed-
species flocks’ (line 190/191), and willow tits actively induce fission of flocks when caching seeds
silently (nominally to reduce the risk of pilferage). However, from the data presented it can’t be
concluded that the absence of calls leads to fission of flocks, and an alternative explanations for willow
tits to stop calling when a flock has been established and it is safe for them to pay attention to
caching.
RESPONSE: Thank you so much for your comments. We agree that our data do not show any
mechanism that drives the fission of flocks. In other words, our data cannot tell that willow tits are
able to actively induce the flocks to leave the patch. For your first point, we revised the manuscript
not to mention that the absence of calls induces fission of the flocks. For your second concern, we
rephrased the text not to say that tits actively control the flocking behavior, but instead use passive
voices such as “calling behavior influences flock dynamics”. However, the fact that willow tits adjust
their calling behaviour according to the presence and absence of flock members (namely audience
effect) suggests that they may be actively attract other flock members to the food site (see also
Suzuki 2012 Ethology). So, we added a brief mention of this possibility in Discussion (Lines 261-262)
and introduced similar phenomena in Introduction (Lines 48-61).
COMMENT: Overall, the interpretation of the results as evidence for ‘previously unknown influence of
individuals' foraging decisions on the fission-fusion dynamics of mixed-species flocks’ (Line 177/178)
are not supported by the data. The paper should instead focus on the fact that willow tits can adjust
their individual foraging decision (feeding versus caching) and calling behaviour according their social
environment, and perhaps have some influence on building up the number of individuals in the flock
(via recruitment, as shown by the authors’ previous work). Besides the broad concern with over-
extending what can be drawn from the results and occasional lack of clarity about its scope, the paper
is enjoyable to read. It is a solid experiment with interesting results that represent a distinct
contribution to the literature.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your positive comments. We revised the manuscript by focusing more on
the link between foraging decision and calling behavior (e.g., Lines 62-72; 243-247; 261-264). We
hope our revised manuscript will satisfy your main concerns.
Specific comments:
Introduction
COMMENT: Line 35-37. Consider rephrasing to clarify what is meant here and what the contradiction
refers to.
RESPONSE: We clarified this point by contrasting two distinct mechanisms that determine the spatial
and temporal distribution of other species (Lines 37-40).
COMMENT: Line 41. Provide a brief definition of ‘fission-fusion dynamics’, given the broad scope
of Royal Society Open Science.
RESPONSE: According to your main concern, we decided not to mention the fission of flocks, and
revised the manuscript by focusing more on the links between foraging decision and calling behavior.
Thus, we did not give the explanation of “fission-fusion dynamics” here.
COMMENT: Line 50 and line 181. Reference [19], Hamilton’s model on selfish herd dynamics, doesn’t
seem an appropriate citation here. Maybe use a more general reference, such as Krause & Ruxton,
Living in Groups, 2002.
RESPONSE: Thank you for the information. We replaced these two references as suggested (see Line
317).
COMMENT: Line 54. ‘Overall, the fine adjustments of flock cohesion, according to foraging decisions,
may be advantageous for willow tits.’ – this would benefit from rephrasing for clarity. Does it mean
‘foraging in mixed-species flocks appears to be generally beneficial for willow tits’, or ‘willow tits would
benefit from being able to influence flock cohesion’?
RESPONSE: To clarify this point, we largely revised this part of text. We gave a detailed description
and interpretation of the previous work (Suzuki 2012 Ethology) in Lines 55-61, and explained our
present hypothesis in Lines 62-72.
Methods
COMMENT: Use either passive or active voice throughout the methods section.
RESPONSE: We revised this section by using passive voice.
COMMENT: Line 87. Why did the observational sessions last for ‘approximately 10 min’? Did the
authors follow each focal individual until it visited the feeder 10 times, which took about 10 minutes,
or what was the criterion to end a trial?
RESPONSE: We continued the observation for ca. 10 min, since tits typically continued to repeat
feeder visitations during the first 10 min after arrival. We added this explanation in Lines 116-117.
COMMENT: Line 88-90. This belongs into the results section.
RESPONSE: We feel that the brief description of feeder visitation will help readers to understand the
following sentences on behavioral measurements (Lines 117-121). So, we would leave this sentence
as it was.
COMMENT: Line 95. ‘We considered these instances as caching’ - What’s the percentage of feeder
visitations that this definition applies to?
RESPONSE: We gave the actual number of such instances in Line 122 and total number of feeder
visitations in Line 134.
COMMENT: Line 97. ‘were never observed to consume it.’ - Is this unpublished data or personal
observation? Please indicate.
RESPONSE: Yes, it is our personal observation. But, we found a published paper showing that willow
tits do always consume food items close to the feeders, whereas they do cache food far from the
feeder (Nakamura & Wako 1988 J. Yamashina Inst. Ornithol.). So, we cited this reference in this
context (Line 124).
COMMENT: Line 101. ‘Data from 13 sites, in which willow tits never visited the feeder’ - I am surprised
that in a quarter of all trials no willow tit visited the feeder, given that they were within only 15m. Can
the authors comment on these trials? Do they think that the birds didn’t see the feeder, or did it take
them longer then 10 minutes to approach it?
RESPONSE: In 13 trials where other species of birds visited the feeder, willow tits were not observed
from the observation position for 10 min. So, they appeared to engage in foraging at a far distance.
We added this mention in Lines 129-131.
COMMENT: Line 106. How many feeder visitations were recorded by other species?
RESPONSE: We could not count the number of feeder visitations by other species, since we focused
only on the behavior of focal willow tits (focal-observation method; Lines 112-113).
COMMENT: Line 109-110: ’to test whether the recruitment calls of willow tits function to attract flock
members’ - Isn’t that per definition the function of these calls? Also, it has been neatly demonstrated
in Suzuki 2012 Ethology, reference [16]. The authors could choose to be a bit more forthright about
their previous work and how this work extends their previous work. It seems to be sufficient new
results to warrant a follow-up paper, but it would probably also improve the visibility of the previous
work if the current manuscript built more clearly on it.
RESPONSE: For the first comment, we replaced “recruitment calls” with “taa calls” which are named
from their sounds. For the second comment, we revised the text to clarify what the advance of this
study is and what the differences from previous work are (Lines 81-84; 138-139).
COMMENT: Lines 112-113. In treatment (ii) the authors do not simulate the presence of a willow tit at
all, therefore this shouldn’t be considered a simulation of the presence of a non-calling willow tit, as
opposed to treatment (i), the simulation of the presence of a calling willow tit. Treatment (ii) would be
better referred to as a control or background noise.
RESPONSE: According to your comment, we referred treatment (ii) as a control, to test the effect of
“taa” calls on the associations with other flock members. We clarified this point in Introduction (Line
84-85) and Methods (Lines 145-146).
COMMENT: Line 122. Give details about the distance of the loudspeaker from the flock. This would
clarify whether the individuals that were counted within 15m of the loudspeaker actively approached
the speaker from a larger distance.
RESPONSE: We added the mention that we ensured that the distance between the tit and tree with
the loudspeaker set at less than 15 m (Lines 154-155). As we counted the number of birds in the
silent period preceding call or background noise (Lines 159-160), we could count the number of
individual birds that approached the loudspeaker from more than 15 m apart from the loudspeaker.
COMMENT: Line 127. ‘separated by at least 400 m to ensure independence of the data [16]’ - From
the reference provided, it is not clear how this should ensure independence of the data.
RESPONSE: We added the details about this (Lines 161-163).
COMMENT: Line 133 Statistical analysis. - From the two models used to investigate the relationship
between the calling and foraging behaviours of willow tits, it is not clear what the main research
question is. Currently, there are potentially circular statements, such as ‘There was a significant effect
of the subsequent foraging behaviour on the probability of calling’ (Line 159), and ‘The subsequent
foraging behaviour was affected by the calling decision’ (Line 163/164). The dependent variable
should be determined by the research question, and only ecologically relevant factors should be
included as fixed effects.
RESPONSE: Thank you for the helpful comments. We excluded “calls” from the fixed term of the
statistical modelling on foraging behaviour, as it is not logically needed for our research question
(Lines 174-176). Our main research question focused on the effect of foraging decisions on calling
behavior, but not the effect of calling behavior on foraging modes.
COMMENT: Line 143. Additionally to the variance inflation factor (VIF), it would be good to see actual
correlation of fixed effect factors. Not only is this generally good practice, but it is also interesting
biology.
RESPONSE: We added information on the actual correlations between fixed factors in Lines 179-181.
The maximum correlation coefficients between fixed factors were generally low for both models (first
model: 0.24; second model: -0.15), which is consistent with the result from the analyses of VIFs.
Results and Discussion
COMMENT: The data do not provide any evidence that recruitment calls maintain cohesion or stability
of flocks (lines 167-168, line 179, and line 226-228). The mere playback of recruitment calls, i.e.
without supplying food, effectively keeps more birds longer near the speaker, compared to a playback
of background noise, but there is no evidence that flocks fission in the absence of calls.
RESPONSE: Agree. We revised the text not to tell the absence of calls induces fission of the flocks.
Instead, we wrote that “calls facilitate the temporal cohesion with flock members” to describe the
results that birds approach the loudspeaker and stay longer time around it (Lines 206-207; 212-213,
218-219).
COMMENT: Further, there is no support for the claim that ‘recruitment calling (...) serves to coordinate
the fission and fusion of mixed-species bird flocks’ (line 222-223). While, arguably, the so-called
recruitment calls facilitate the fusion of flocks by attracting both conspecifics and heterospecifics
(references: this study, and [16]), there is no evidence that willow tits actively coordinate the fission
of foraging flocks - either by calling, nor by not-calling. The most parsimonious hypothesis is probably
that willow tits recruit heterospecifics to food resources that are larger than they can access alone (per
Elgar’s work with sparrows) and do so in order to be able to devote greater attention to caching due to
the increased vigilance for predators.
RESPONSE: We agree that there is no evidence that tits actively coordinate the fission of the flocks.
Therefore, we revised the manuscript not to mention this. It is not likely that willow tits can devote
greater attention to caching by associating with other flock members. If this is true, willow tits may
increase the caching rate when flock members are present around. However, we found that foraging
decisions was not affected by the presence or absence of other flock members. This implies that tits
decide foraging modes depending on their internal factors, such as energetic conditions (Lines 243-
247).
COMMENT: The authors continue to suggest that willow tits actively induce fission of flocks when
reducing or stopping to call (line 226-228: ‘can actively adjust the social cohesiveness of the flocks by
producing vocalizations’). They argue that willow tits ‘tend to be silent while caching food items,
leading to the fission of flocks’ (Abstract, line 22), which then decreases the risk of pilferage (line 183-
186). This argument doesn’t seem sound for a few reasons. First of all, there is no evidence that the
absence of calls leads to fission of flocks. Secondly, willow tits probably reduce the risk of pilferage by
caching silent and solitarily. Thirdly, willow tits may stop calling because there is no need for attracting
more birds once a flock has been established. This is why the term ‘suppression of calls’, used in this
context throughout the manuscript, is problematic.
RESPONSE: (i) We agree that our results does not provide evidence that the absence of calls leads to
fission of the flocks. Therefore, we revised the text not to mention this. (ii) We also agree with the
point that willow tits may reduce the risk of pilferage by caching silent and solitarily. We provided this
possibility in Lines 67-69 & 225-227. (iii) We included both the presence of flock members (i.e, social
contexts) and foraging decisions in the statistical model of calling behavior. Thus, while the
establishment of foraging flocks may reduce calling probability, foraging decisions do also affect the
calling behaviour. We avoided saying “tits suppress (or stop) calling” throughout the manuscript, as
we feel “tits do not produce calls” is a better wording for describing this behaviour.
COMMENT: Lines 203-208. If willow tits consume food just before the arrival of flock members to
avoid competition, they should also cache food prior to arrival of flock members, as either action
requires taking a seed. Generally, one could probably assume that the competition for seeds is
relatively low, given that food is provided in a big open tray, allowing several birds to feed
simultaneously, and birds usually take a seed and leave the site, to process the seed in a tree/bush
nearby.
RESPONSE: Agree. We deleted the mention about foraging competition from this paragraph (Lines
239-247).
COMMENT: Lines 214-221. This paragraph seems rather speculative regarding the objectives of this
paper.
RESPONSE: We have shortened this part of text and revised it to link the main finding of this paper
with the direction of future research (Lines 252-258)
COMMENT: Line 226. There is no contrast between previous studies suggesting that mixed-species
flocks form through heterospecifics following each other, and the findings reported here that
recruitment calls of willow tits attract both conspecifics and heterospecifics to facilitate formation of
mixed-species flocks in this way. Again here, the data do not allow making statements on the ‘social
cohesiveness of the flock’.
RESPONSE: Thank you for the suggestion. We wrote that our findings are consistent with the previous
descriptions of the movement patterns of mixed-species flocks (Line 251-252). For the concluding
paragraph, we revised the text by focusing more on the link between calling behaviour and foraging
decisions (Lines 262-264).
COMMENT: Finally, it would be useful if the authors would comment on the relative importance of
individual predictors in the GLMM. The authors make the effort to standardise their measures, but they
never report on the effect sizes.
RESPONSE: We gave sample size and chi-squired values in table 1 and 2 so that readers can readily
calculate the effect size for meta analyses.
Minor corrections:
COMMENT: Line 18. Remove hyphen in ‘short-time scale’.
RESPONSE: Corrected (Line 18).
COMMENT: Line 39. Remove redundant ‘away’.
RESPONSE: Corrected (Line 44).
COMMENT: Line 41. Replace ‘finely’ with either ‘specifically’, or ‘precisely’.
RESPONSE: This sentence was changed in consideration for your comment on the term “fission” (Lines
46-47).
COMMENT: Line 57. Replace ‘coexist’ with ‘occur’.
RESPONSE: We changed this sentence to read “we also analysed the influence of social contexts on…”
(Lines 78-81)
COMMENT: Line 58. Should be ‘caching’.
RESPONSE: Corrected (Line 76)
COMMENT: Line 86. Replace ‘measure’ with ‘record’.
RESPONSE: Corrected (Line 112)
COMMENT: Line 87. The authors might want to change ‘the first author’ to ‘the experimenter’,
according to common standard.
RESPONSE: According to your former suggestion, we choose to revise this section in passive voice
(Line 113).
COMMENT: Line 104. Replace ‘at all trials’ with ‘in all trials’.
RESPONSE: Corrected (Line 132).
COMMENT: Line 112. Remove ‘while consuming food items’.
RESPONSE: We have deleted this sentence (Lines 138ff).
COMMENT: Line 126. Add ‘a’ to ‘measured at (a) distance of 1 m’.
RESPONSE: We included this information in parentheses (Lines 150 & 152).
COMMENT: Line 155. Change to ‘discovery of a new feeder’.
RESPONSE: We changed this sentence to “Willow tits changed their calling and foraging behaviours on
repeated visitations to feeders” (Line 192-193).
COMMENT: Line 157. Replace ‘shifted’ with ‘did’, and adjust the other verbs accordingly.
RESPONSE: We revised the text not to use “shift” and adjusted the text accordingly (Lines 194-196).
COMMENT: Line 168. Add ‘the’ to ‘first 1.5 min of (the) playback’.
RESPONSE: Corrected (Line207).
COMMENT: Line 182. Replace ‘during’ with ‘before’.
RESPONSE: Corrected (Line 221).
COMMENT: Line 203. Add reference for dominance relationships.
RESPONSE: We deleted this section according your former comment.
COMMENT: Line 209 et seq. Why not cite reference 16 here?
RESPONSE: The aim of this playback experiment was different from that of previous work (Suzuki
2012 Ethology). So, we clarified the differences between these two studies in Lines 81-84; 138-139.
COMMENT: Line 211. Replace ‘apparently allows’ with ‘may allow’.
RESPONSE: Corrected (Line 250)..
COMMENT: Line 228. Should be either individuals’, or an individual's.
RESPONSE: Corrected (Line 264).
COMMENT: Tables. Intuitively, the results from the first model are expected to be reported in Table 1,
and the results from the second model in table 2, respectively.
RESPONSE: We replaced the order of the first and second model in statistical analysis (Lines 172-
176).
Appendix B
We are generally very pleased with the authors’ responses to our comments on the previous version of the
manuscript, and with how they implemented the suggested changes. We think that the authors have adequately
dealt with the concerns we raised regarding the original draft. However, we have a few minor suggestions.
It seems a bit odd the way that the results are constructed. The authors posit that the calling behaviour (what
they are fundamentally interested in) is affected by their foraging behaviour. However, they first test a model that
ncludes presence of conspecifics, heterospecifics, and foraging behaviour on calling (yes/no), and then construct
a second model investigating the effects of conspecifics/heterospecifics/visitations on foraging behaviour. The
ogic behind the hypothesis-testing framework appears to be backwards: first the authors should test what
determines foraging behaviour (as done in Table 2 currently), and then test whether foraging behaviour
determines what calls are made (a model simply of call ~ foraging behaviour). At present there are parts of the
data that seem to contract each other – for example plotting either the calling propensity or the caching
propensity as a function of presence of other individuals reveals almost the same pattern:
These appear to differ from the conclusions of the paper that calls are affected by others but foraging is not.
Further, why did the authors split presence of conspecifics and heterospecifics into binary variables, but keep
them separated? It would make sense to have the count of each type of bird, or the presence of any other flock-
mate, but this current categorization doesn’t seem to explain the data well. Perhaps the authors might consider
having a simple ‘others present’ variable (ideally counts, but could be binary) in the main text, and the separated
version in a supplement. Either way, the authors should add a brief explanation of how conspecifics and
heterospecifics could have different effects on a willow tit’s foraging decision.
Figure 4a is a very useful way of understanding the dynamics of what is happening – it great if the authors could
generate a similar figure for the observational data at the patches.
We think that the manuscript requires a more detailed discussion of the benefits and risks associated with call
production. In the first paragraph of the discussion (Lines 216-227), the authors argue that call production in
willow tits is influenced by their subsequent foraging behaviour, because
) willow tits call more before food consumption in order to attract flock members and to benefit from anti-predator
advantages during group foraging, and
i) willow tits call less before caching food to reduce the risk of being pilfered.
Arguably, avoidance of pilferage may be one important benefit of “silent caching”. However, the authors should
discuss minimizing predation risk as an alternative explanation for why willow tits usually don’t call when caching
food away from the flock. The authors do briefly mention that the production of loud calls may increase the risk of
attracting predators to the callers in the second paragraph of the discussion (Lines 235-238). Yet, this should be
discussed further as a potentially important reason for reducing vocal behaviour once flock members got
recruited to the feeder.

MINOR COMMENTS:
L21: ‘foraging modes’ is a bit unclear.
L27: ‘retain cohesion’ – perhaps better to state ‘maintain presence at the foraging patches’
L28: ‘temporal dynamics’ is vague – this sentence would be perhaps better cast in terms of niche construction –
they manipulate the behaviour of heterospecifics at patches.
L58: Highlight Farine et al 2015 RSOS that shows the temporal dynamics of such flocks can be short – meaning
that these calls are relevant. This citation is also useful for the use of a 10 minute observation window.
Line 66. Recommend removing “close” before associations in this context..
L69: This section should really cite Brodin’s recent work on cache pilfering by great tits. Also – why don’t willow
tits experience higher predation risk when handling cached items later on? Do you expect them to also recruit to
these patches?
L109: This sounds like the authors placed the patches immediately at the start of the trial. In our experience, it
can take hours, if not days, for feeders to be discovered (e.g. Farine & Lang 2013 Biology Letters). Have the sites
previously been used to feed the birds?
Line 155 and 158. The information that the loudspeaker was placed less than 15m away from the flock in focus is
repeated.
Line 194 and 199. Suggest replacing “around the feeder” with “close to” or “nearby the feeder”.
Line 196. “Trend” usually refers to non-significant results. Please rephrase accordingly.
Line 208. Add a comma before “than”, and “when” after it.
L220: ‘and through the recognition of alarm calls’ is oddly worded – that is just one of the mechanisms that they
can reduce predation.
L225: but those individuals are already present and have been attracted to the feeder – so the logic here does
not make sense.
L231: I’m not convinced that anyone has shown that willow tits ‘lead’ other species to feeders. Leading and
recruiting are quite different mechanisms.
Line 246. The hypothesis has not been stated in this manuscript. Does it link to other work by the authors?
Figures 2 and 3. These plots are generally hard to interpret. It might be helpful to include the underlying counts,
e.g. how many times was an item cached, and of those cases, how often did the focal bird call beforehand, and
how many times did it not call.

MMENT: The current version of the manuscript is much improved from the version I previously reviewed
I enjoyed having the chance to look at it again. However, I still have a fewer minor comments that I feel
authors should address before it is suitable for publication.
SPONSE: Thank you so much for the invaluable comments. We believe we could address all the
ments raised by both reviewers, and revised the manuscript accordingly.
:
MMENT: The title as it stands is quite long and I wouldn’t mind seeing the authors attempt to write a
rter version perhaps without the colon
SPONSE: Thank you for the comment. We have shortened the title by highlighting our main finding:
raging intention affects whether willow tits call to attract members of mixed-species flocks”.
tract:
MMENT: L16-L18: This sentence is a bit awkward and should be rewritten to be clearer
SPONSE: We have clarified these sentences (Lines 16-18).
oduction:
MMENT: L36-L37: I think this opening sentence needs to be stronger. The two parts of it also come in
wrong order i.e. I would expect a (i) In order to answer this big evolutionary/ecological question, (ii) it is
ortant to understand…
SPONSE: Thanks for the comments. We made the opening sentence stronger and clarified the logical
cture of following sentences (Lines 36-42).
MMENT: L41: Would recommend not using “might” in this sentence and providing more citations of
n/how mixed-species flocks have been used previously
SPONSE: We deleted the “might” from the sentence and included more citations (Line 40).
MMENT: L40-L43: More generally, this sentence is a bit long and could be more to the point
SPONSE: We shortened and clarified this sentence (Lines 39-42).
MMENT: L45: I don’t feel “economic” is the correct word here
SPONSE: We deleted “economic” (Line 44).
MMENT: L46/L47: Reword this sentence so that you don’t have to use the word “information” and can
ead use a word like knowledge or understanding. Given you are already talking about information use in
animals, this is confusing
SPONSE: Thanks for the comment. We replaced the “information” with “knowledge” accordingly (Line
MMENT: L50: Delete “the” before greater racket-tailed drongos
SPONSE: Corrected (Line 49).
MMENT: L51: This example, and its relevance, is currently quite unclear to the reader
SPONSE: We revised these sentences to clarify the link between drongo’s system and the present study
es 48-52).
MMENT: L52-L53: The sentence starting “Drongos increase…” needs rewording to aid clarity
SPONSE: Corrected (Lines 50-52).
hods:
MMENT: L98-100: Are these results from this study? If so, please clarify
SPONSE: Yes, they are. We clarified this point (Line 97-99).
MMENT: L108: Not clear to me what is meant by “an experimental site was randomly assigned in each
st opening”
SPONSE: Thank you for the comment. We clarify how we randomly assigned the experimental site (Lines
-108).
MMENT: L153-163: This was the one section of the methods that I felt could be improved. I think some
ugh should be put into the ordering of sentences in this paragraph to make it clearer and improve the flow
SPONSE: We agree with this comment, and thus revised the structure of this paragraph (Lines 153-167).
ults:
MMENT: L201: I think saying that it affected the two behaviours differently is a misnomer. It was more
one behaviour was affected and the other wasn’t. I feel this needs to be made clear here
SPONSE: Thank you for the comment and we agree with this too. The first two paragraphs of Results
tion have been greatly revised according to the other reviewers’ comments.
les:
MMENT: Degrees of freedom are currently not provided, is there a reason for this? Also I think the
nd and the model terms need to contain more information to enable them to be interpreted with out the
n text (e.g. what is subsequent behaviour? What is meant by conspecifics and heterospecifics – number?
sence? Etc)
SPONSE: We provided the degrees of freedom in both tables and included more information on the
lyses (GLMMs) in the legends.
ure 2:
MMENT: Why is the width of the absence/presence bars different in part c) from parts b) and d)
SPONSE: We agree that the previous version of the figure was hard to understand. For the previous
s, the area of each bar was linked with the sample size. We redraw figure 2 and 3 to be more acceptable,
iliar formats. Thank you.
cussion:
MMENT: L219-220: I would prefer to see a bit more expansion to the wider context in this initial
agraph of the discussion, especially related to the ideas in these two lines
SPONSE: We appreciate this reviewer’s comment and extended this first paragraph of the discussion
ordingly (Lines 231-239).
MMENT: L221: Delete “Therefore,”
SPONSE: Corrected (Line 231).
MMENT: L232-234: This sentence needs rewording
SPONSE: Corrected (Lines 240-243).
MMENT: L236-238: It would be good to see the points made at the end of this paragraph developed
e fully
SPONSE: This section has been revised according to the comments by other reviewers (Lines 240-250).
MMENT: L240-L243: There are some big assumptions in this bit of discussion and it feels like there may
alternative explanations possible here too (e.g. some kind of risk-averse strategy) so it would be nice to
some caveats to this idea
SPONSE: Thank you for the valuable comments. We added an alternative explanation on the change in
ging behaviors from feeding to caching (Lines 251-262).
MMENT: L245-247: This bit of discussion seems like an ideal opportunity to set this study in the context
ome broader ecological ideas. I would suggest that the authors expand a bit here with some additional
vant citations
SPONSE: According to the comments by other reviewers, we re-run the models by simply including the
sence/absence of any flock members. We found that willow tits cache more when with flock members
n when alone. So, social context is also affecting the foraging decisions. We clarified this point in Lines
-250.
MMENT: L260: “suggest vocalisations” rather than “calling behaviour”
SPONSE: We would like to leave “calling behaviour” because “vocalisations” may not refer to the
avior (but calls/sounds).
MMENT: L261: Suggest replacing “may” with “have the potential to”
SPONSE: Corrected (Lines 276-277).
MMENT: L264: Suggest “vocalisations” rather than “calling behaviour”
SPONSE: See our response above.
MMENT: L264-L268; I would suggest making this final sentence shorter, more to the point and less far
ching. I would focus more explicitly on its implications for social foraging and mixed-species groups rather
n “the complex patterning of community assembly”
SPONSE: We shortened the final sentences by focusing more on the implications for social foraging and
ed-species flocking (Lines 278-281).
Thank you for reviewing our manuscript.

ever, they first test a model that includes presence of conspecifics, heterospecifics, and foraging
aviour on calling (yes/no), and then construct a second model investigating the effects of
specifics/heterospecifics/visitations on foraging behaviour. The logic behind the hypothesis-testing
ework appears to be backwards: first the authors should test what determines foraging behaviour (as
e in Table 2 currently), and then test whether foraging behaviour determines what calls are made (a
del simply of call ~ foraging behaviour).
SPONSE: Thank you so much for reviewing our manuscript again. We believe we could address all the
ments raised by both reviewers, and revised the manuscript accordingly.
We appreciated these main comments by reviewers. We agree that the ordering of two analyses
uld be replaced. We revised the methods, results, tables and discussion so that the logical structure
ches this new ordering. We would like to include the parameters other than the foraging behavior in the
del of calling behavior, because our previous study suggests that social environments (presence/absence
ock members) influence the calling behavior. In addition, number of visits to the feeder might also
ence the vocal production as well as the foraging behavior. In this revised version of manuscript, we
ified the discussion on the influence of social environment and number of visits on calling behavior (Lines
-250; 251-259).
MMENT: At present there are parts of the data that seem to contract each other – for example plotting
er the calling propensity or the caching propensity as a function of presence of other individuals reveals
ost the same pattern:
se appear to differ from the conclusions of the paper that calls are affected by others but foraging is not.
her, why did the authors split presence of conspecifics and heterospecifics into binary variables, but
p them separated? It would make sense to have the count of each type of bird, or the presence of any
er flockmate, but this current categorization doesn’t seem to explain the data well. Perhaps the authors
ht consider having a simple ‘others present’ variable (ideally counts, but could be binary) in the main text,
the separated version in a supplement. Either way, the authors should add a brief explanation of how
specifics and heterospecifics could have different effects on a willow tit’s foraging decision.
SPONSE: We are grateful for this helpful comment. We re-run GLMMs with the new categorization of
ial context (presence/absence of any flock members), and found the significant effect of this parameter
oraging behaviors. We also analyzed the model by including each species of birds separately, but these
dels produce larger AIC values than the former models, indicating the simpler categorization is better
laining the data. We added this information in the main text (Lines 177-181) but not as a supplement
ause of its readability. We agree that using the number of individuals is better than using binary
ables, but counting the number of birds around the feeder was difficult when focusing on the foraging
avior of willow tits. Thus, we used the presence/absence in the models.
MMENT: Figure 4a is a very useful way of understanding the dynamics of what is happening – it great if
authors could generate a similar figure for the observational data at the patches.
SPONSE: We agree that such a new figure will help understand the dynamics of the flocks. However,
the same reason as our previous response, it was difficult to correctly evaluate the number of birds
ved at the feeder every minutes, especially when focusing on the willow tit foraging behaviors. So, we
ld not produce this additional figure.
MMENT: We think that the manuscript requires a more detailed discussion of the benefits and risks
ociated with call production. In the first paragraph of the discussion (Lines 216-227), the authors argue
call production in willow tits is influenced by their subsequent foraging behaviour, because
illow tits call more before food consumption in order to attract flock members and to benefit from anti-
dator advantages during group foraging, and
illow tits call less before caching food to reduce the risk of being pilfered.
uably, avoidance of pilferage may be one important benefit of “silent caching”. However, the authors
uld discuss minimizing predation risk as an alternative explanation for why willow tits usually don’t call
n caching food away from the flock. The authors do briefly mention that the production of loud calls may
ease the risk of attracting predators to the callers in the second paragraph of the discussion (Lines 235-
). Yet, this should be discussed further as a potentially important reason for reducing vocal behaviour
e flock members got recruited to the feeder.
SPONSE: We agree with this comment. The hyper-dispersed caching can be explained by the risk of
rage by other members, but the reduction of calling would be better explained by anti-predator
antages. It is possible that willow tits call more often when consuming seeds than when caching them,
ply because the benefits for attracting other members to the feeder are greater when consuming than
n caching. We clarified these point in Introduction (Lines 62-72) and Discussion (Lines 227-239; 246-
). We also added a more detailed explanation for the costs and benefits of calling behavior and why tits
uce call production on later visits to feeders (Lines 240-262). We found the effect of the type of foraging
avior on calling behavior even when including the parameter of presence/absence of flock members.
implies that willow tits do not call even when they are caching solitarily (but not in a flock).
OR COMMENTS:
MMENT: L21: ‘foraging modes’ is a bit unclear.
SPONSE: Thank you for the comment. We rephrased “foraging mode” with “foraging intention”, since we
k it is more suitable. Willow tits decide whether call or not before making foraging behaviors (Line 22),
foraging intention affected the calling decisions.
MMENT: L27: ‘retain cohesion’ – perhaps better to state ‘maintain presence at the foraging patches’
SPONSE: Corrected (Lines 26-27).
MMENT: L28: ‘temporal dynamics’ is vague – this sentence would be perhaps better cast in terms of
e construction – they manipulate the behaviour of heterospecifics at patches.
SPONSE: Thank you so much for the comment. We avoided using “temporal dynamics” and clarified this
tence (Lines 27-28).
MMENT: L58: Highlight Farine et al 2015 RSOS that shows the temporal dynamics of such flocks can be
rt – meaning that these calls are relevant. This citation is also useful for the use of a 10 minute
ervation window.
SPONSE: Thanks for the comment. We added the mention that mixed-species tit flocks are highly
able in their membership over short time periods and may not stable at a single foraging patch (Lines 58-
We also used this citation in Line 117.
MMENT: Line 66. Recommend removing “close” before associations in this context..
SPONSE: Corrected (Line 66).
MMENT: L69: This section should really cite Brodin’s recent work on cache pilfering by great tits. Also –
don’t willow tits experience higher predation risk when handling cached items later on? Do you expect
m to also recruit to these patches?
SPONSE: We added a Brodin’s review on food caching in Line 69. We think that willow tits cache items
away from the feeder to reduce the risk of pilferage. However, anti-predator advantage of group feeding
ld be larger when individuals are more closely associated with others. Thus, anti-predator benefits of
acting other individuals to the feeder would be greater for tits consuming food close to the feeder than
e caching food away from the feeder. We clarified these points in Lines 65-72.
MMENT: L109: This sounds like the authors placed the patches immediately at the start of the trial. In our
erience, it can take hours, if not days, for feeders to be discovered (e.g. Farine & Lang 2013 Biology
ers). Have the sites previously been used to feed the birds?
SPONSE: No. All “the feeder sites” were truly novel for the birds. We put the feeder at a forest opening,
ch may be easily seen by forest birds from the distance. It might also be possible that birds may stay in
500 x 500m forest block to search for the experimental feeder, as a result of repeated exposure of “the
der” to the same flocks.
MMENT: Line 155 and 158. The information that the loudspeaker was placed less than 15m away from
flock in focus is repeated.
SPONSE: Corrected (Lines 153ff.).
MMENT: Line 194 and 199. Suggest replacing “around the feeder” with “close to” or “nearby the feeder”.
SPONSE: Corrected (Line 199).
MMENT: Line 196. “Trend” usually refers to non-significant results. Please rephrase accordingly.
SPONSE: Corrected (Lines 198 and 206).
MMENT: Line 208. Add a comma before “than”, and “when” after it.
SPONSE: Corrected (Line 219).
MMENT: L220: ‘and through the recognition of alarm calls’ is oddly worded – that is just one of the
hanisms that they can reduce predation.
SPONSE: We appreciate this comment. However, since another reviewer wants to extend this part a bit
e, we added some lines here (Lines 231-239).
MMENT: L225: but those individuals are already present and have been attracted to the feeder – so the
c here does not make sense.
SPONSE: We agree with this comment and clarified the logic of the reason for silent caching in Lines
-262. In consideration for suggestion, we delete the mention that calling near food increases the risk of
rage. Instead, we explain that willow tits may cache seeds in hyper-dispersed locations to prevent
rage by others, and therefore, they may not be allowed to obtain anti-predator benefit of group feeding
n caching seeds (Lines 65-72; 231-239).
MMENT: L231: I’m not convinced that anyone has shown that willow tits ‘lead’ other species to feeders.
ding and recruiting are quite different mechanisms.
SPONSE: Corrected (Lines 266-267).
MMENT: Line 246. The hypothesis has not been stated in this manuscript. Does it link to other work by
authors?
SPONSE: We agree with this reviewer’s comment. As we found a significant effect of social context on
ging behavior, this part of text has been deleted.
MMENT: Figures 2 and 3. These plots are generally hard to interpret. It might be helpful to include the
erlying counts, e.g. how many times was an item cached, and of those cases, how often did the focal bird
beforehand, and how many times did it not call.
SPONSE: We agree that the previous versions of the figures are hard to interpret. For the previous plots,
area of each bar was linked with the sample size. One option is, as suggested, to add sample sizes
in each area within the plots. Another option is, as suggested by another reviewer, to redraw the figures
the same width of each bar. We redraw figure 2 and 3 in this manner and gave sample sizes in the
nds, which are more acceptable, familiar formats.
Thank you for reviewing our manuscript.

MMENT: The authors dealt carefully with the reviewers’ comments, and addressed all concerns and
cisms brought forward in an adequate manner. The revisions have greatly improved the clarity of the
nuscript. Especially the visual presentation of the results makes them much easier to interpret and
ussion is more comprehensive. On that note, we suggest that the justification for not including additional
lyses using more than just presence or absence is not very strong, and that the manuscript would benefit
having this additional level of detail we proposed in our previous comments. Although the AIC suggests
this level of detail does not fit the data as well, that is not really the metric we are after here – instead we
after gaining a better understanding of willow tit recruitment calling based on the state of the social
ironment.
SPONSE: Thank you so much for reviewing our manuscript again. We are happy to hear that our
nuscript has been improved. In consideration for the comments on the categorization of social context, we
hrased the text (Lines 174-179) to clarify that we choose our categorization since it better explains the
stment of foraging and calling behaviour in willow tits.
