Comments to the Author(s)

The study looks at the yea-round food and feeding ecology of a seabird, the little penguin, using
the stable isotope method. While it contains useful data, the ms. needs to be thoroughly revised
before being acceptable for publication.
Major comments
Title, abstract and throughout the text (L358, for example). In one hand, your title and abstract
include several times the word “shift”, but it seems that dietary changes were not so obvious and
instead, more gradual; hence the use of the word “subtle” a the beginning of the discussion.
Reword title & abstract.
L377. If you look at Table 3, there are definitely no “isotopic niche shifts”, since many isotopic
variations within one year were pretty small (< 1‰).
The SI method is at its maximum when used with other complementary methods. As written on
L511 (L36), monitoring the penguin diet through stomach content analysis is of paramount
importance. L358 suggests that dietary data are available in 2007-2012 (Preston 2010). You
definitely have to include that information in the present ms., including the fish size-class for
anchovy and sardine.
Within that context (chick diet) and having in mind the demographic consequences of adult diet
(Table 3), I am surprised that you did not blood sample large chicks. The SI values of chick blood
allow (i) comparing diet modeling using SI with the “true” diet, and (ii) a SI comparison between
chicks and adults using chicks as a control group (again you know their real diet).
L289 and below. Right, but you did not collect prey in 2007. Consequently, you do not know their
2007 SI values, thus precluding estimating the penguin diet from blood samples on that year.
Delete the 2007 year or discuss (and change 2007/2008 to 2008 throughout the text).
L489-499. From your data, it seems that there is no relationship between the SI niche and
reproductive output when considering the 4 years. If yes, you have to write this explicitly and
discuss that crucial point. In other words, the SI method itself has no explaining value for the
little penguin demography, thus greatly limiting its use.
Main comments
Lines 179-184. Did you check if the SI values from the same samples were similar when measured
in the 2 different labs.? This is a crucial issue. My own experience shows that, unfortunately, there
d
are some consistent differences amongst lab., especially in 15N.
Lines 260-271. Lipids were not extracted from the 2008 samples. Hence, did you correct the 13C d
values or not, and if yes, how? This is especially important when comparing 2008 versus
2011/2012 (L281).
In my opinion, you cannot refer here to Sotiropoulos et al. (2004), because the isotopic difference
between delipidated versus non-extracted tissues depends on the amount of muscle lipids that
depend itself on the species. Anchovy and sardine are very fatty fish that accumulate lipids in
d
their muscle (and no very fatty fish is included in Sotiropoulos et al. 2004); hence a larger 13C
difference than 1 ‰ is expected for adult fish. You can check this easily by looking at the C:N
mass ratio of the samples.
3
Within that context, insert a new table with the SI values of prey according to the way they were
collected (stomach contents versus fishing boats), years and ontogenetic stages and including a
column with the C:N mass ratios.
L339-354 & Table 3. Include statistics in that section of the results.
L450-455. The seasonal nutritional importance of different ontogenetic stages of the same prey is
an important issue, but this is not a new finding for seabirds. Have a look for example on the
work on the food and feeding ecology of kittiwakes in the North Sea (e.g. Progress Oceanogr
72:30-38, 2007 and other publications).
Table 2. Include two columns within that table with: (i) the uncorrected values for feathers; it is
quite informative because the corrected values are estimates, not true SI measurements; and (ii)
the C:N mass ratios, to easily check if everything is right with the lipids.
Minor comments
L23-24. This is true for every animal species, whatever its food and feeding ecology (not only for
species relying on local resources). Reword.
L60-62 and throughout the text. No more than 3 references in a row.
L69. The common guillemot is a migratory species, not a resident one.
L79-81. A recent paper also investigates the year-round foraging ecology of seabirds (MEPS
505:267-280, 2014). Another useful study refers to terrestrial birds (Oecologia 161:149-159).
L86-89. Explain that the isotopic niche is a proxy of the ecological niche, but only a proxy. In other
words it is by far not equal to the isotopic niche.
L130-132. Did you cut the distal part of the feathers that has a different SI signature than their
middle and proximal parts (“income” versus “capital” moults; Ecology 86:2881-2888, 2005)?
Detail.
L132. Better explain why SI values of penguins feathers provide dietary information on the pre-
moult period (and not on the moulting period itself, like in most other birds). To my knowledge,
Bearhop et al. (2002) does not refer to penguins, but to flying birds; hence you have to change that
reference to a penguin one.
L193. Fry (2006) is not detailed in the reference list P28).
L214. R development Core Team (2008) is not detailed in the reference list (P33).
L228. I was unable to find those values (discriminant factors) in Chiaradia et al. (2014), which
indicate values for plasma and blood cells, but not for whole blood. Hence, detail.
L260. To my knowledge, no prey was collected in 2007 (see L145).
L262. Here and throughout the text. Delete one decimal to the SI values (and include ‰ after -
16.3 and 13.8).
L781-783. The reference is incomplete (Preston 2010), MSc, PhD?
L798-799. Ropert-Coudert et al. (2006) is not cited within the main text.

Comments to the Author(s)

Kowalczyk et al.
In this study the authors used little penguins as a model species to assess how the diets of small
home range, resident seabirds fluctuate between life-stages and years and its relation with prey
availability. This is an interesting study adding new information to the growing literature for the
year round diet of a seabird species, being one of the few regarding a resident, inshore feeder.
Although the study is well design and executed, methods and results should be clarify for an
entirely comprehension of the study carried out. Discussion is relatively long and should be
shortening in order to avoid repetition and to give the point or the finds of the study more
relevance.
Specific comments
Introduction
Line 62-64: there are some studies on winter habitat of seabirds in particular using stable isotope
or geolocators or both together, I suggest adding some reference i.e. Cherel et al. 2006, Phillips et
al. 2009, Thiebot et al. 2012, to name a few.
Methods
Line 116-118: The beginning of the breeding season is variable, but also is variable within the
colony? Are there couples at different stages at the same time in the colony? This is important
regarding the samples and the stages in relation with it.
Line 124-126: The methodological design is not clear, within these sentences it is not easy to
understand if they are talking about the same individuals sampling at different stages. A table
with birds and date will be convenient.
Line 133: Again methods are not clear would be helpful if the authors could specify number of
individuals, dates and type of sample, indicate if same individuals are used for both samples
feathers and blood for example. Date is important but also which stage does it represent.
5
Line 145: Also prey when were they sampled? And what penguin stage represent? It is not clear
the design of sampling, how many seasons, how many times during each season. Something is
reveal in results but better if specify here.
Line 149: when were these new samples gathered?
Line 165: How was it prepared? It is not clear as for the other years there is an explanation for the
preparation did it differ before the lipid removed?
Line 168-171: In reference to the comment above. Was this done in 2008 also?
Line 197: Were the same individuals that were samples for stable isotope analysis? All males and
females were implanted with transponders for each nest?
Line 199: Why subsets? What does this mean?
Line 208: Why to used Type II sum of squares please explain the reason.
Line 224: For the mixing models which prey value do the authors use? The values took from each
year? Please will be interesting to know these details.
Results
Line 260: the notation of years is a bit confusing, before each year was separated by AND, here
2007/2008 could be either breeding season commencing in one year but extended to the
following year, or two different seasons. I suggest using the same notation throughout the
document.
Line 272: The notation should be revised.
Line 288-289: This comment is quite hard to understand here. As it is not so lineal the relationship
between penguins diet isotope values and that of the prey availability at the same time. Results
should be presented in a way in which the reader could follow the reasoning. This comment
should be done after the mixing models analysis, and I suggest re write the results section to
make more clear, the diet and differences between stages and years, and prey availability (prey
and size or stages of prey) and values and differences between stages and years.
Line 299: What about prey availability the other years and stages?
Line 309: Add BY, “was dominated BY blue sprat”.
Discussion
Line 358-360: The fluctuation in the prey assemblage age structure for each year is not clear in the
results section. Please discuss better or later during the discussion as you add information on
availability, and/or add details in results.
Line 392-393: This sentence seems contradictory with the paragraph above. On one hand the
authors defined penguins as flexible eating what is available, but on the other hand the results
show that they do not prefer certain prey even it is more abundant.
Line 409: This comment is also contradictory with what is mentioned above and repetitive.
Line 429: what is this THIS about?
Line 440-443: This sentence is not clear please rewrite.

Figure legends
Line 873: what is it this 1?
Line 886: Add from a-g for different years, or something similar.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The article was greatly improved following the referees’ comments, but I still have one major
concern. As written in the ms. (L77-78 of the revised version), the SI method is at its maximum
when used with conventional assessments of diet, namely stomach content analysis. L358 of the
first draft suggested that dietary data are available in 2007-2012 (Preston 2010). You definitely
have to include that information in the present ms., including the fish size-class for anchovy and
sardine, before acception of the ms. Do that even if only chick food was collected.
L79. There is a confusion between 2 references by Cherel et al. (2014), with only one being listed
at the end [21]. Here you refer to MEPS 505:267-280, not to Mar Biol 161:229-237 [21].
L234. Here you refer to Mar Biol; hence, number that ref. (and delete Cherel et al. (2004)).
L405. To my knowledge, Mar Biol [21] is more complete and includes the data from [70]. Add or
replace.
L366. Delete “large scale”. Again, many of the isotopic variations were pretty small.
L232-233. [58] instead (R Development Core…).
Table 1. There is something wrong for the SI values of feathers in 2012 (no non-corrected values).

The study looks at the yea-round food and feeding ecology of a seabird, the little penguin, using
the stable isotope method. While it contains useful data, the ms. needs to be thoroughly revised
before being acceptable for publication.
Comment # Comments and response
1 Title, abstract and throughout the text (L358, for example). In one hand, your
title and abstract include several times the word “shift”, but it seems that
dietary changes were not so obvious and instead, more gradual; hence the use
of the word “subtle” at the beginning of the discussion. Reword title &
abstract.
Response:
The running title is now ‘Fine-scale life-stage dietary changes in a resident
seabird’ and the title is ‘Fine-scale dietary changes between the breeding and
non-breeding diet of a resident seabird’. We have added the word ‘subtle’ in
the abstract (line 31) to indicate the gradual change in diet.
2. Line 377 If you look at Table 3, there are definitely no “isotopic niche shifts”, since
many isotopic variations within one year were pretty small (< 1‰).
Response:
Please note: The Reviewer was referring to Table 2, not Table 3.
This section of the discussion subtitled ‘Inter-annual diet and isotopic niche’
focuses on inter-annual dietary and isotopic niche variation. We believe the
Reviewer did not consider ‘the inter-annual’ aspect to this section of the
discussion. While no trophic shifts were observed (i.e. isotopic variations
greater than 3 ‰), differences in isotopic position (particularly for d15N)
between years are clear. For example, pre-moult d15N values range between
17.8 and 19.4, which accounts for a 1.6 ‰ difference between years, winter
d15N values range between 18.4 and 21.1, equalling a 2.7 ‰ difference and
almost amounting to an entire difference in trophic level. Breeding d15N
values range between 18.2 and 20.6 which equals a 2.4 ‰ inter-annual
between years but this is expected given penguins are residents and remain in
Port Phillip Bay year round.
We have modified the title to indicate fine-scale dietary changes were found
in this study and feel we do not mislead readers in doing so. The consistent
changes in stable isotope signatures between life-stages demonstrate subtle
changes in diet across the year.
3. The SI method is at its maximum when used with other complementary
methods. As written on L511 (L36), monitoring the penguin diet through
stomach content analysis is of paramount importance. L358 suggests that
dietary data are available in 2007-2012 (Preston 2010). You definitely have to
include that information in the present ms., including the fish size-class for
anchovy and sardine.
Response:
We agree the stable isotope method can be more powerful when used in
combination with complementary methods. Their combined use is
particularly useful in initial studies. We have done that in Preston (2010) and
Chiaradia et al (2012). While gut content analysis provides crucial information
regarding what seabirds consume, stable isotope analysis were more sensitive
to show variations between life-stages. Assured that stable isotopes alone
were useful to monitor changes in diet, we discontinued stomach sampling at
this study site. Preston’s (2010) data are valuable in providing information
about what prey species were consumed and we have used this data in
conjunction with information regarding local prey biomass in 2007, 2008 and
2011 to inform prey selection in mixing models. As we do not have a year
round assessment of stomach content data for years 2011 and 2012 (only
years 2007 and 2008 are available) we cannot include the gut content data as
requested by the Reviewer. However, we have made multiple references to
Preston’s (2010) work to ensure readers can investigate complimentary
dietary data elsewhere.
Line 358 has been removed from the discussion and no longer misleads the
reader.
4. Within that context (chick diet) and having in mind the demographic
sample large chicks. The SI values of chick blood allow (i) comparing diet
modeling using SI with the “true” diet, and (ii) a SI comparison between
chicks and adults using chicks as a control group (again you know their real
diet).
Response:
The author raises an excellent point. This was not considered at the time of
sampling and no chick blood samples were obtained in this study. Further,
differences between chick and adult stable values can be confounded by
assimilation and prey size as discussed in Chiaradia et al 2014.
5. Lines 289 and Right, but you did not collect prey in 2007. Consequently, you do not know
below their 2007 SI values, thus precluding estimating the penguin diet from blood
samples on that year. Delete the 2007 year or discuss (and change 2007/2008
to 2008 throughout the text).
Response:
Due to the small sample size of prey in 2007 (n=2) and the similar isotope
ratios within species across years, prey items collected in 2007 and 2008 were
pooled to reconstruct the 2007 and 2008 diet of penguins. The prey
collection process is outlined in the newly added Table 2 and discussed in the
methods lines 156-160. Also, previous studies (Preston 2010, Chiaradia et al
2010, 2012) have given us confidence that prey values have smaller variability
between years than between species.
6. Lines 489-499 From your data, it seems that there is no relationship between the SI niche
and reproductive output when considering the 4 years. If yes, you have to
write this explicitly and discuss that crucial point. In other words, the SI
method itself has no explaining value for the little penguin demography, thus
greatly limiting its use.
Response:
The author is correct; there is not relationship between the SI niche and
reproductive output over the 4 year period in this study. For this reason we
have removed sections referring to penguin measures of reproductive success
from the methods, results (including Table 3), and two lines have been
removed from the discussion. Removing reproductive success data from this
manuscript does not weaken the manuscript as only a small section of the
discussion was focused on this aspect of the study and the message remains
the same without the breeding results.
Even without variability, we still believe that the stable isotope method has
explaining value for the demography of little penguins or seabirds in general.
Provided that studies are designed to enable the detection of causal
relationships between stable isotopes and reproductive success then this
method can be an extremely valuable tool. Lines 467-482 discuss how the
combined use of monitoring diet, stable isotopes and seabird demography
can be used to assess how seabirds are responding to fluctuations in their
prey and whether their adaptations to these prey shifts are viable.
7. Lines 179-184 Did you check if the SI values from the same samples were similar when
measured in the 2 different labs.? This is a crucial issue. My own experience
shows that, unfortunately, there are some consistent differences amongst lab.,
especially in d15N.
Response:
Inter-laboratory variability in stable isotope analysis of animal tissue can lead
to discrepancies in d13C / d15N results between laboratories. In this study,
replicate samples were not sent to both laboratories to ensure result
congruency due to logistic, financial and ethical issues. However, inter-
laboratory stable isotope variability does not greatly influence this dietary
reconstruction study for several reasons now outlined in lines 218-230. Our
previous results analysed at different labs have showed similar consistent
patterns (Chiaradia et al 2010, 2012, 2014).
8. Lines 260-271 Lipids were not extracted from the 2008 samples. Hence, did you correct the
d13C values or not, and if yes, how? This is especially important when
comparing 2008 versus 2011/2012 (L281).
In my opinion, you cannot refer here to Sotiropoulos et al. (2004), because
the isotopic difference between delipidated versus non-extracted tissues
depends on the amount of muscle lipids that depend itself on the species.
(and no very fatty fish is included in Sotiropoulos et al. 2004); hence a larger
d13C difference than 1 ‰ is expected for adult fish. You can check this easily
by looking at the C: N mass ratio of the samples.
Response:
In this study, C: N ratios in penguin prey in 2007/2008 were between 3.0 and
4.5 and therefore were anticipated to have some influence on the SIAR
reconstructed diet of penguins. 2007/2008 values were normalised by
detracting the mean difference between lipid extracted and non-extracted
d13C values from 2011/2012 anchovy and southern garfish samples.
Normalised values were included in mixing models. Normalisation
procedures are now outlined in lines 189-199. Additionally, both non-
normalised and normalised values have been added to Table 2 and have been
included in analyses. Figures 1a-f, 2a-d, and 4a and 4b have been modified to
include normalised lipid values.
We have removed the Sotiropoulos et al. (2004) reference from the paper.
9. Within that context, insert a new table with the SI values of prey according to
the way they were collected (stomach contents versus fishing boats), years
and ontogenetic stages and including a column with the C:N mass ratios.
Response:
We have inserted Table 2 which outlines which prey was collected annually,
how it was collected, prey stable isotope values, their normalised/lipid
removed ratios and their C: N mass ratios as suggested by the Reviewer.
10. Lines 339- Include statistics in that section of the results.
354 & Table 3.
Response:
Reproductive success results have been removed from this manuscript.
Please see point 6 above for more information about the decision to remove
reproductive success results.
11. Lines 450- The seasonal nutritional importance of different ontogenetic stages of the
455 same prey is an important issue, but this is not a new finding for seabirds.
Have a look for example on the work on the food and feeding ecology of
publications).
Response:
The Reviewer is right; the seasonal nutritional importance of different
ontogenetic stages of the same prey has been documented in several studies.
We have made reference to the study above in the discussion in lines 427-429
to highlight this. But, very few studies include different ontogenetic stages in
dietary reconstruction studies using mixing models. We therefore identify the
potential importance of including multiple ontogenetic stages in mixing
models to determine the fine-scale diet of seabirds.
12. Table 2. Include two columns within that table with: (i) the uncorrected values for
feathers; it is quite informative because the corrected values are estimates, not
true SI measurements; and (ii) the C:N mass ratios, to easily check if
everything is right with the lipids.
Response:
Two columns have been added to the table that provide information about (i)
the uncorrected values for feathers and (ii) the C:N mass ratios of penguin
blood and feathers as suggested by the Reviewer.
13. Lines 23-24. This is true for every animal species, whatever its food and feeding ecology
(not only for species relying on local resources). Reword.
Response:
Sentence has been reworded. See lines 23-24.
14. Lines 60-62 No more than 3 references in a row.
and throughout
the text Response:
All areas where more than 3 references in a row have been changed to
include a maximum of 3.
15. Line 69 The common guillemot is a migratory species, not a resident one.
Response:
According to the literature, in some colonies common guillemots are
described in Owen et al 2013 is a resident colony and is therefore an
appropriate reference that highlights life-stage dietary variation in a resident
seabird.
16. Lines 79-81 A recent paper also investigates the year-round foraging ecology of seabirds
(MEPS 505:267-280, 2014). Another useful study refers to terrestrial birds
(Oecologia 161:149-159).
Response:
Many thanks for these references. The MEPS 505:267-280, 2014 article is
now referenced in line 79. To avoid listing 4 references in a row the
Oecologia 161:149-159 study was not referenced. This study is specific to
terrestrial birds and is therefore less relevant in the context of this study.
17. Lines 86-89 Explain that the isotopic niche is a proxy of the ecological niche, but only a
proxy. In other words it is by far not equal to the isotopic niche.
Response:
Sentence has now been altered to: ‘Additionally, stable isotopes can be used
to calculate the ‘isotopic niche’ of seabirds and provide quantitative
information on resource and habitat use, parameters that can be used as
proxies to define the ecological niche of populations (Hutchinson 1978;
Newsome et al. 2007; Newsome et al. 2012).
18. Lines 130- Did you cut the distal part of the feathers that has a different SI signature
132 than their middle and proximal parts (“income” versus “capital” moults;
Ecology 86:2881-2888, 2005)? Detail.
Response:
Line 142 details what part of the feathers were used. An explanation for why
the entire feather was homogenised as opposed to distal, middle or proximal
parts has been inserted into the methods section lines 136-138.
19. Line 132 Better explain why SI values of penguins feathers provide dietary information
on the pre-moult period (and not on the moulting period itself, like in most
other birds). To my knowledge, Bearhop et al. (2002) does not refer to
penguins, but to flying birds; hence you have to change that reference to a
Response:
The Reviewer makes a good suggestion. We have included a sentence the
turnover rate of little penguin feathers and the dietary period they represent
in lines 136-138. We have removed the Bearhop et al. (2002) reference in
favour of Tierney et al 2008 who specifically address dietary reflection
periods in penguins.
20. Line 193 Fry (2006) is not detailed in the reference list P28).
Response:
Fry has now been inserted in the bibliography
21. Line 214 R development Core Team (2008) is not detailed in the reference list (P33).
Response:
The R reference is now listed in the bibliography
22. Line 228 I was unable to find those values (discriminant factors) in Chiaradia et al.
(2014), which indicate values for plasma and blood cells, but not for whole
blood. Hence, detail.
Response:
When species specific discrimination factors for whole blood are not
available it is advised to use red blood cell discrimination factors for the
species as an alternative, as was done in this study. However, recently, a
discrimination factor for whole blood for little penguins has come to our
attention (McKenzie, 2011-Masters Thesis). We have altered the fractionation
values and citation in lines 248-250 and these new values have been applied
to all mixing models. Therefore images 1 and 3 have been altered to include
the new trophic enrichment factors.
23. Line 260 To my knowledge, no prey was collected in 2007 (see L145).
Response:
A small sample of prey was collected in 2007. 2007 and 2008 prey samples
were therefore pooled to improve mixing models. See added lines 148 and
24. Line 262 Here and throughout the text. Delete one decimal to the SI values (and
include ‰ after -16.3 and 13.8).
Response:
All values now have one decimal point after the colon and now include the
‰ symbol as suggested.

Ropert Coudert et al (2006) now removed from the bibliography
Reviewer “B”
In this study the authors used little penguins as a model species to assess how the diets of small
home range, resident seabirds fluctuate between life-stages and years and its relation with prey
availability. This is an interesting study adding new information to the growing literature for the
year round diet of a seabird species, being one of the few regarding a resident, inshore feeder.
Although the study is well design and executed, methods and results should be clarify for an
entirely comprehension of the study carried out. Discussion is relatively long and should be
shortening in order to avoid repetition and to give the point or the finds of the study more
relevance.
Comment # Comments and response
1.Line 62-64 There are some studies on winter habitat of seabirds in particular using stable
isotope or geolocators or both together, I suggest adding some reference i.e.
Cherel et al. 2006, Phillips et al. 2009, Thiebot et al. 2012, to name a few.
Response:
Several references highlighting the non-breeding diet inserted here as suggested
2. Line 116-118 The beginning of the breeding season is variable, but also is variable within the
colony? Are there couples at different stages at the same time in the colony?
This is important regarding the samples and the stages in relation with it.
Response:
Yes, there is within and between colony variations in breeding commencement
date, with couples at different stages of the breeding cycle within the breeding
season, now outlined in lines 112. We have now highlighted that breeding diet
refers the incubation and guard stages of breeding in lines 117-119.
3. Line 124-126 The methodological design is not clear, within these sentences it is not easy to
understand if they are talking about the same individuals sampling at different
stages. A table with birds and date will be convenient.
Response:
We have provided more detailed information about sampling design in the
methodology in lines 123-126. Additionally, a column has been added to Table
1 to indicate when birds were sampled and how this corresponds with their
annual cycle as suggested by the Reviewer.
4. Line 133 Again methods are not clear would be helpful if the authors could specify
number of individuals, dates and type of sample, indicate if same individuals
are used for both samples feathers and blood for example. Date is important
but also which stage does it represent.
Response:
The added information provided in line 125 and Table 1 clarifies the questions
posed by the Reviewer, specifically that each penguin was sampled for a single
life-stage. Table 1 specifies how many individuals were sampled, the life-stage
and month of sampling and the tissue type sampled.
5. Line 145 Also prey when were they sampled? And what penguin stage represent? It is
not clear the design of sampling, how many seasons, how many times during
each season. Something is reveal in results but better if specify here.
Response:
about the prey collection process.
6. Line 149 When were these new samples gathered?
Response:
New samples were gathered in the winter of 2008 as specified in line 152-154.
7. Line 165 How was it prepared? It is not clear as for the other years there is an
explanation for the preparation did it differ before the lipid removed?
Response:
Samples were freeze dried, ground and 0.4 - 0.6 mg tissue samples were loaded
into tin caps prior to stable isotope analysis. These details have now been
added in lines 175-178.
8. Line 168-171 In reference to the comment above. Was this done in 2008 also?
Response:
As mentioned in line 166 lipids were not extracted in 2008. However,
following the first Reviewer’s suggestion we normalised d13C values and the
details regarding this are outlined in lines 189-199.
9. Line 197 Were the same individuals that were samples for stable isotope analysis? All
males and females were implanted with transponders for each nest?
Response:
The reproductive success section of the manuscript has now been removed.
10. Line 199 Why subsets? What does this mean?
Response:
The section in reproductive success has now been removed from the
manuscript
11. Line 208 Why to used Type II sum of squares please explain the reason.
Response:
Please note the Reviewer made a typing error and refers to Line 218 and Type
II sum of squares. In our study Type III SS were used to accommodate
12. Line 224 For the mixing models which prey value do the authors use? The values took
from each year? Please will be interesting to know these details.
Response:
Extra detail regarding which prey were used in mixing models is now
presented in lines 246-248.
13. Line 260 The notation of years is a bit confusing, before each year was separated by
AND, here 2007/2008 could be either breeding season commencing in one
year but extended to the following year, or two different seasons. I suggest
using the same notation throughout the document.
Response:
We have added information about the reasons for the pooling of prey and
have specified that prey collected in 2007 and 2008 were pooled and referred
to 2007/2008 thereafter. The same has been done for prey collected in 2011
and 2012. We trust the added information in the methods as well as the added
table (Table 3) will clarify why we used the 2007/2008 and 2011/2012
notation.
14. Line 272 The notation should be revised.
Response:
Sentence removed for clarity
15. Line 288- This comment is quite hard to understand here. As it is not so lineal the
289 relationship between penguins diet isotope values and that of the prey
availability at the same time. Results should be presented in a way in which the
reader could follow the reasoning. This comment should be done after the
mixing models analysis, and I suggest re write the results section to make more
clear, the diet and differences between stages and years, and prey availability
(prey and size or stages of prey) and values and differences between stages and
years.
Response:
We have revised the results section to improve clarity
Response:
We removed line 299 from the results section as this point is better suited to
the discussion.
17. Line 309 Add BY, “was dominated BY blue sprat”.
Response:
BY added before blue sprat
18. Line 358- The fluctuation in the prey assemblage age structure for each year is not clear
360 in the results section. Please discuss better or later during the discussion as you
add information on availability, and/or add details in results.
Response:
This paragraph has been removed from the discussion. We discuss fluctuations
in the age structure of fish communities in Port Phillip Bay in lines 417-420
and lines 442-448.
19. Line 392- This sentence seems contradictory with the paragraph above. On one hand the
393 authors defined penguins as flexible eating what is available, but on the other
hand the results show that they do not prefer certain prey even it is more
abundant.
Response:
This paragraph has been removed from the discussion to improve clarity and
to shorten the discussion.
20. Line 409 This comment is also contradictory with what is mentioned above and
repetitive.
Response:
Sentence has been removed for clarity
21. Line 429 What is this THIS about?
Response:
Lines 429-432 have been removed from the discussion as they repeat what was

1. The article was greatly improved following the referees’ comments, but I still
have one major concern. As written in the ms. (L77-78 of the revised version),
the SI method is at its maximum when used with conventional assessments of
diet, namely stomach content analysis. L358 of the first draft suggested that
dietary data are available in 2007-2012 (Preston 2010). You definitely have to
include that information in the present ms., including the fish size-class for
anchovy and sardine, before acception of the ms. Do that even if only chick
food was collected.
Response
Year-round stomach content data is only available for years 2007 and 2008.
Due to the consistency in stomach prey items and ethical constraints, stomach
flushing was discontinued thereafter. We do not have fish size-classes for
sardines, or any data regarding chick stomach content. We have included a
table (Table 3) on penguin stomach content between years 2007 and 2008 and
a figure (Figure 1) indicating the age composition of anchovy in stomach
contents over this time period. We have also included information on stomach
content collection and analysis in the methods lines 121-134:
‘Stomach content analysis
Ten penguins were caught when entering the St Kilda breakwater each moth
between February 2007 and October 2008. Individual penguins were identified
via passive integrated transponders (Trovan, Ltd., Australia) and stomach
contents from the sampled penguins were obtained using a modified water
offloading technique [39] and frozen prior to analysis. Prey items were
measured to the nearest 0.1 mm and identified from otoliths and squid beaks
using methods outlined in Preston (2010) [31]. The length and weight of each
fish and squid was calculated from published regression equations of otoliths
classes according to size, based on data from anchovies collected within Port
Phillip Bay [43]. The <1 year cohort corresponded to standard lengths <63
mm, 1-2 year cohort 63-91mm and 2-3 year cohort 92+ mm (none larger than
98 mm were recorded), recognising that there is overlap in size between the
age cohorts. No stomach analysis was conducted after October 2008 due to
monthly consistencies in stomach content prey items.’
and 246-251:
‘Differences in stomach prey composition (of the three main prey species)
between year (2007 and 2008) and life-stage (pre-moult: Feb/Mar/Apr, winter:
May/June/Jul, breeding 2007: Sep/Oct/Nov, 2008: Aug/Sep/Oct) were tested
using a two factor ANOVA with type III sums of squares. Life-stage and inter-
annual differences in anchovy sizes were also determined using type III
ANOVA.’
We present these findings in results in lines 286-298, in Table 3 and Figure 1:
‘In 2007 and 2008, anchovy (Engraulis australis) and southern garfish
(Hyphorhamphus melanochir) dominated the diet of penguins year-round
(Table 3). Cephalopods comprised only a small proportion of the diet overall
with bay squid (Loliolus noctiluca) being the most common species (Table 3).
The remaining species were predominantly comprised of Australian sprat
(Sprattus novaehollandiae), blue sprat (Spatelloides robustus), sandy sprat
(Hyperlophus vittatus), pilchard (Sardinops sagax) and hardyhead spp. The
stomach content sampling showed no significant difference between year (F [1]
= 3.3, p > 0.05) or life-stage (F [2] = 2.3, p > 0.05) for the three main species
(anchovy, southern garfish, bay squid) consumed. Mean size of anchovy
calculated from published otolith-standard length regression equations was
approximately 72 mm, corresponding to anchovies of approximately 1-2 year
age class. This age class dominated the diet of penguins year-round (Fig.1).
There was no significant difference in the size of anchovies taken either by
We discuss stomach content results in the Winter section of the discussion
lines 456-461:
‘Similarly, stomach content results in the winters of 2007 and 2008
demonstrated that even though anchovy dominated the diet of penguins, there
were no obvious seasonal increases of <1yr and 1-2 yr anchovy cohorts in
winter compared to other times of the year [31]. The methodological
constraints of each dietary sampling technique differ [73] making it difficult to
determine whether ontogenetic dietary shifts are driving the consistent isotopic
trends in the winter diet of penguins.’
and in the Breeding section of the discussion lines 483-488:
‘Stomach content analyses over summer months in 2007 and 2008 found no
seasonal increase in the adult anchovy cohort [31]. But, the stomach content
study found an increased abundance of Australian sprat, sandy and blue sprat
which are thought to enter bays and inlets in south western Australia to spawn
in spring and summer months [77-79], providing support for the tenet that
depleted d13C values reflect the increased consumption of prey entering Port
Phillip Bay from offshore regions.’
2. Line 79 There is a confusion between 2 references by Cherel et al. (2014), with only
one being listed at the end [21]. Here you refer to MEPS 505:267-280, not to
Mar Biol 161:229-237 [21].
Response
The Reviewer is correct. These references were accidently mixed. Ref 21 now
refers to MEPS 505:267-280.
3. Line 234 Here you refer to Mar Biol; hence, number that ref. (and delete Cherel et al.
(2014)).
Response
deleted from the text and is replaced with its corresponding reference number
and reference.
4. Line 405 To my knowledge, Mar Biol [21] is more complete and includes the data from
[70]. Add or replace.
Response
The Reviewer is correct, the Mar Biol study is more complete. We have added
the Mar Biol [21] reference to this statement instead of using ref [70].
5. Line 366 Delete “large scale”. Again, many of the isotopic variations were pretty small.
Response
We have deleted “large-scale” from this sentence as suggested.
6. Line [58] instead (R Development Core…).
232-233
Response
R in text reference has been corrected.
7. Table 1 There is something wrong for the SI values of feathers in 2012 (no non-
corrected values).
Response
We greatly appreciate that the Reviewer picked up on these missing values.
They have now been inserted into Table 1.

Kowalczyk et al.
The manuscript suffered considerable changes. Methods, results and discussion have greatly
improved. I think that my concerns on the original version have been adequately addressed in
this revised version.

1. Indicate/precise in the text (L131-134 & 286-298) and in Table 3 that
dietary contribution refers to percentages by mass or by number.
Response:
We have included additional information regarding the quantification of
stomach content data in lines 135-138:
‘Stomach content samples were quantified using a modified weighted relative
occurrence method [44]. The percentage contribution of each item to the stomach
sample based on mass (calculated by linear regression) was determined and
averaged across all samples to provide a percentage contribution value for each
prey item for each month [31].’
We have specified how dietary contribution was assessed in line 290:
‘Based on the quantified mass of each prey item for each month…’
Additionally, Table 3 has been modified to state prey was quantified by mass.
