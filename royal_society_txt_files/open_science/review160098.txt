In this manuscript, Sole et al propose a model to find congestion hotspots in road traffic in an
urban environment. The model, inspired by previous works in congestion transitions in
computer networks, represents a nice translation of concepts and techniques from one area to
another. The manuscript is in general lines well written, although I have some comments on the
structure of the text. For these reasons, I recommend the publication of the manuscript once the
authors have considered the following comments and suggestions.
The model is an evolution of previously proposed works on traffic in computer networks. The
orientation has been focused on car traffic in cities, but as the authors recognize themselves it
would be valid to other transport modes or even car traffic in general, not necessarily internal to
urban areas. It could be important to stress this point out a little more in the introduction and the
conclusions. The reason for this is that after all the work in realistic models for traffic jams,
including those with real volume of cars, dispersion of speeds, traffic waves, etc, this model may
look an oversimplification of traffic. In my opinion, however, it brings a needed simplification in
some of these models but this question has to be very clear in the manuscript.
To establish also the questions that have been already analyzed in previous models on internet
traffic, it could be important to mention the differences between this model and those studied in
the literature in this context.
The structure of the manuscript is a little disturbing. The model is described in detail only in
materials and methods and, therefore, the reader finds the results in section 2.1 and 2.2 without
having a very clear idea of what all this is about. The readability would improve moving the
materials and methods section immediately after the introduction.
The term validation applied to the section 2.1 in the context of traffic models is usually applied to
test the model predictions against a data set different from that of training. Here it means more a
check of the theoretical predictions via numerical simulations. This can produce some confusion
depending on the background of the reader.
The name hotspot is used an indication of a congestion node. However, in recent literature about
urban systems this term has been used in a very different context as center of activity. It may be
important to include a short discussion about the relation and differences between these two
concepts.

In this work, a very simple model of traffic congestion is proposed, Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) + the
stationary hypothesis. Due to the simple form of kind of global coupling, Eq. (2.2), the model is
solvable by iterations for a given set of $P_{ji}$ and $p_i$. The resulting congestion transition
turns out to be continuous in contrast to majority of congestion models.
I like the idea of this model very much, Figure 1 clearly explains the contributions to (2.1). It is
valuable that the work contains not only solution of the model and its analysis for "synthetic"
networks, but also a thorough "congestion hotspot analysis" for a number of cities.
The manuscript is clear and well written. I have no essential remarks, and so I recommend that
this work be accepted as it is.

manuscript and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments
made by the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload".
You can use this to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to
expedite the processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your
response to the referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including
captions) and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your
user account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include
your data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the
relevant doi within your manuscript
5) Included your supplementary files in a format you are happy with (no line numbers,
vancouver referencing, track changes removed etc) as these files will NOT be edited in
production
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I
look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not
hesitate to get in touch.

nks for your recommendations. We have rewritten some paragraphs of the
uscript to highlight these facts, and also re-organized the sections and

different from that of training. Here it means more a check of the
oretical predictions via numerical simulations. This can produce some
fusion depending on the background of the reader.
