Review of Yehezkel et al., “Binocular combination of stimulus orientation”, submitted to Royal
Society Open Science.
Summary
This is a well-executed and concisely reported study on how the brain combines stimuli with
different orientations shown to the two eyes (or both to the same eye). The study builds on
previous work on binocular phase combination, and existing models are shown to account well
for the new data set. I have several suggestions that I think would improve the work, but it is a
strong paper that will make a worthwhile addition to the literature.
Specific points
1. The title of the paper suggests that it is about binocular combination, and the introduction and
modelling all focus on the binocular aspect of the experiment. Yet the results for monocular and
dichoptic presentation are very similar indeed, and any differences at the group level seem to be
driven largely by one observer (OE). Are the complexities of the preferred model (multiple stages
of interocular gain control) really necessary to explain these results? Are the differences between
monocular and dichoptic data statistically significant?
2. A refresh rate of 100Hz will give each eye a 50Hz refresh rate, which is below many people’s
flicker threshold. Did participants experience flicker? Furthermore, the phosphors on a colour
monitor decay slowly, so I would expect there to be appreciable crosstalk between the eyes. It
would be helpful to have an estimate of this (i.e. by measuring the luminance of a patch shown to
the left eye through the right eye’s shutter using a photometer), as substantial crosstalk could be
responsible for the similarity of the monocular and dichoptic results.
3. When comparing model fits, it would be useful to calculate a statistic such as AIC or BIC that
takes the number of free parameters in each model into account. Is the preferred model still the
best description of the data, given that it has the most free parameters?
4. Did participants ever experience diplopia with these stimuli? How would they have responded
if they had?
5. Around line 73 it would help the reader to specify that the orientation differences are relative
to vertical. Do the authors think that repeating the experiment with orientations relative to
horizontal would produce substantially different results, given the lack of disparity sensitive cells
around that orientation?
6. The caption for Table 1 could be clearer – what do the percentages represent?
7. In the section starting on line 131, it wasn’t clear whether the monocular and dichoptic trials
were interleaved within a block or not. I’m guessing not from the trial numbers, but would be
good to make explicit.
8. Although there were only 4 observers, they completed many many trials each. It would be
helpful to have an idea of how long this took, just so that it is clear to the reader why running
more subjects wouldn’t have been practical.
3
9. Line 153 – should ‘summed’ be ‘pooled’?
10. Table 3 – what are the errors and how were they derived?
11. In the section on contrast detection thresholds (line 178), it would be more typical to refer to
binocular and monocular conditions (rather than dichoptic and monocular), assuming that the
orientations are the same across the eyes.
12. Table 5 – would be helpful to specify what ‘v’ is in the table caption.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In this study authors Levi et al. have conducted a thorough examination into how the orientation
of a pair of Gabor patches is fused both between and within eyes. Although the experiments have
been conducted very well, I am not convinced by the statistics used to support the presented
conclusion. It may well be that my understanding of the analysis used is incorrect, however I
believe that currently the authors are not interpreting their reduced Chi-square values correctly.
Page 5, Line 96: Do the authors have any measurements for the amount of crosstalk between the
left/right eye presentations for this setup? Since it is difficult to predict the amount of crosstalk
expected a priori (would have to be determined using a combination of the specific response time
and leakage of the glasses, along with the refresh rate and persistence of the phosphor in the
monitor), it would be helpful to have some measurement obtained directly from the apparatus.
Page 9, Line 188: A minor suggestion that it might be preferable to use another word such as
“fused” rather than “cyclopean” to refer to the perceived image after the two eye’s inputs are
combined. The origin of the word “cyclopean” may lead readers to initially believe the observer
is reporting an image seen only by a single eye (e.g. due to interocular suppression).
4
Page 11, Line 230: As the modelling is such a crucial part of the paper I think it is important that
the necessary equations are presented in the main text.
Page 12, Line 244: As above, I think the necessary equations should be presented in the main text.
Page 18, Line 328: Not a criticism of your paper (as it does not have this problem), but it would be
nice to see a quick mention of how each of your lesser models are special cases of the models with
more parameters (i.e. that they are nested models). The fact that this is a requirement of nested
model testing is not always appreciated.
Page 18, Line 333: Although it is true that your model with the greatest number of parameters is
giving you your best fit, that does not account for overfitting. By my understanding, a reduced
Chi-square value of less than one is supposed to indicate that the model is overfit to the noise in
the data – and that the winning model should be that which has a reduced Chi-square value
closest to one (see for example the introduction of Andrae, Schulze-Hartung & Melchor, (2010):
Dos and Don’ts of Reduced Chi-Squared, at https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3754). If true this would
mean that DKSL is not actually superior to Model 2.

I was aware of that when I made my previous comment about the reporting of the reduced Chi^2

even AIC is prone to selecting overfitted models. For this reason the use of corrected AICc (which

I am a little confused by the F-test that has been added because it would seem to indicate that the
additional parameters of the DKSL model would be highly justified by the improvement they
make to the quality of the fit, however if this calculation is based on the Chi^2 values then it

iew of Yehezkel et al ‘Binocular combination of stimulus orientation’
s paper uses well-designed experiments to examine how orientations are combined
ocularly and monocularly as a function of contrast and orientation differences. The main
pose of the paper is to determine if the modified Ding-Sperling model can account for
binocular combination of orientation, in addition to its previously-reported success in

del to the monocular combination of two orientations. Based on the abundance of data
ected on four subjects, the authors reject the linear vector summation model and argue
t the data best support the elaborate multi-stage DSKL model. The validity of the DSKL
del is particularly apparent at low base contrasts.
jor comments:
What does the observer perceive binocularly? In the introduction, the authors note that
tical orientation disparities are associated with surfaces slanted about a horizontal axis.
the observers see a slanted surface with a superimposed oriented grating pattern? How
s the apparent slant change with the contrast ratio? Based on the Mansfield and Legge
ults, the depth of the slanted surface may be unaffected by the contrast ratio, with only
apparent orientation of the grating shifting upon it. If so, this result is well worth
orting along with some remarks on the dissociation between orientation and disparity
cessing.
The reader is offered only a superficial explanation of how the various stages in the
del function, although more details are available in previous papers. In the absence of
re information, statements like “mutual suppression and mutual enhancement were
tematically stronger under binocular than under monocular conditions” are puzzling.
at does this mean about the physiological processes underlying the model components?
the authors have a speculation about the origin of these differences?
As the angle between the Gabor patches decreases from 20 to 10 degrees, the data and
DSKL model calculations move close to the predictions of the linear summation model.
observer ST, the differences between the two models for 10 deg is barely greater than
error bars for all base contrasts. It would be helpful if the authors provided an intuitive
lanation for this result. Is this because the perceived orientation shift at the contrast

s is a well-executed and concisely reported study on how the brain combines stimuli with
erent orientations shown to the two eyes (or both to the same eye). The study builds on
vious work on binocular phase combination, and existing models are shown to account well
the new data set. I have several suggestions that I think would improve the work, but it is a
ng paper that will make a worthwhile addition to the literature.
nks for your positive comments and constructive suggestions.
cific points
he title of the paper suggests that it is about binocular combination, and the introduction
modelling all focus on the binocular aspect of the experiment. Yet the results for
nocular and dichoptic presentation are very similar indeed, and any differences at the group
el seem to be driven largely by one observer (OE). Are the complexities of the preferred
del (multiple stages of interocular gain control) really necessary to explain these results? Are
differences between monocular and dichoptic data statistically significant?
main focus in this study was on binocular combination, and we initially performed the
nocular experiments as a control at the suggestion of George Sperling. For that reason, we
fer to maintain the title as is; however, the Reviewer raises a very important point regarding
similarity of the two data sets. In the revised version we emphasize that while there are
ng similarities between the monocular and dichoptic data they do differ primarily in mutual
pression and mutual enhancement (Fig. 5). We added the following table in Supplemental
terial of the revised version to summarize the variance across observers. We also added the
owing sentences at the end of the Results section: “The variance across observers is
marized In Supplemental material, Table S1. We note that, for observers D.V. and O.E.,
re is a strong effect of mutual suppression and mutual enhancement under binocular
ditions, while under monocular conditions, mutual suppression is weak effect and there is no
tual enhancement. For these two observers, the monocular and dichoptic data are
ificantly different (p<0.05) at 10% base contrast; the mutual suppression was much stronger
er binocular conditions than under monocular conditions. However, as base contrast
eased, mutual enhancement canceled the mutual suppression under binocular conditions,
ulting in similar data to those under monocular conditions at high base contrast (60%). For
ervers Y.S. and S.T., the monocular and dichoptic data are very similar; under both binocular
monocular conditions, observer Y.S. showed strong suppression and enhancement while
erver S.T showed strong suppression but no enhancement.”

whether adding a new stage or parameter improves the fit over the simpler model.
refresh rate of 100Hz will give each eye a 50Hz refresh rate, which is below many people’s
ker threshold. Did participants experience flicker? Furthermore, the phosphors on a colour
nitor decay slowly, so I would expect there to be appreciable crosstalk between the eyes. It
uld be helpful to have an estimate of this (i.e. by measuring the luminance of a patch shown
he left eye through the right eye’s shutter using a photometer), as substantial crosstalk
ld be responsible for the similarity of the monocular and dichoptic results.

his study authors Levi et al. have conducted a thorough examination into how the

sest to one (see for example the introduction of Andrae, Schulze-Hartung & Melchor, (2010):
and Don’ts of Reduced Chi-Squared, at https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3754). If true this would
an that DKSL is not actually superior to Model 2.

F-test also shows the further improvement of fit performance by adding gain-control of
n-enhancement (DSKL model vs. Model 2), we cannot exclude the possibility of overfitting
model to the noise in the data because the reduced Chi-square (<U+03C7>! /<U+03BD> ) was less than one. In
study, we didn’t have enough data to test gain-control of gain-enhancement in the DSKL
del, although it significantly improved model fit in our previous studies (Ding, Klein and Levi
3a & 2013b).”

s paper uses well-designed experiments to examine how orientations are combined
ocularly and monocularly as a function of contrast and orientation differences. The main
pose of the paper is to determine if the modified Ding-Sperling model can account for the
ocular combination of orientation, in addition to its previously-reported success in
ounting for binocular phase and contrast combination. The authors also apply the model to
monocular combination of two orientations. Based on the abundance of data collected on
r subjects, the authors reject the linear vector summation model and argue that the data
t support the elaborate multi-stage DSKL model. The validity of the DSKL model is
ticularly apparent at low base contrasts.
nks for your constructive suggestions.
jor comments:
What does the observer perceive binocularly? In the introduction, the authors note that
tical orientation disparities are associated with surfaces slanted about a horizontal axis. Do
observers see a slanted surface with a superimposed oriented grating pattern? How does
apparent slant change with the contrast ratio? Based on the Mansfield and Legge results,
depth of the slanted surface may be unaffected by the contrast ratio, with only the
arent orientation of the grating shifting upon it. If so, this result is well worth reporting
ng with some remarks on the dissociation between orientation and disparity processing.
re was no slant experienced by any of the participants or the authors, perhaps because our
uli did not contain induced disparity, as in the Legge & Mansfield experiments (Vision Res.
. 36, No. 1, pp. 2741, 1996). I.e., from the caption of their Fig. 3: “The disparity was made by
ing equal and opposite shifts to the horizontal locations of the upper Gabor's monocular
ges, so that according to the geometry of binocular vision, the two Gabors should appear
tically aligned.” Moreover, we suspect the small size and brief duration of our stimuli
cluded the perception of depth from slant.
have added in the Discussion: “We note that in our experiments using small Gabor patches
brief exposures, slant was not experienced by any of the participants (or by the authors).”
he reader is offered only a superficial explanation of how the various stages in the model
ction, although more details are available in previous papers. In the absence of more
rmation, statements like “mutual suppression and mutual enhancement were
tematically stronger under binocular than under monocular conditions” are puzzling. What
s this mean about the physiological processes underlying the model components? Do the
hors have a speculation about the origin of these differences?
nks for your comments. To address this issue in the revision, we added the following
tences in the Discussion section: “So far as we know, no physiological studies have directly
ressed the mutual interaction of two gratings with similar orientations. However, based on
dies using gratings with orthogonal orientations, previous physiological studies (Li et al,
5; Sengpiel & Vorobyov, 2005) demonstrated that interocular suppression is substantially
erent from monocular cross-orientation suppression. These studies suggest that interocular
pression is mediated by inhibitory circuitry within the visual cortex, while monocular cross-
ntation suppression is mediated by subcortical mechanisms. “
s the angle between the Gabor patches decreases from 20 to 10 degrees, the data and the
L model calculations move close to the predictions of the linear summation model. For
erver ST, the differences between the two models for 10 deg is barely greater than the error
s for all base contrasts. It would be helpful if the authors provided an intuitive explanation
this result. Is this because the perceived orientation shift at the contrast ratio extremes is
all for small orientation differences? Maybe the y-axis could be expanded for the smaller
le differences commensurate with the likely range of effect, so that it is obvious that there is
model dependence on the angular difference.
nks for your comments. As shown in the following figure, the two models give the same
diction (90 degree) when orientation difference = 0 and contrast ratio = 0.25. With
easing orientation difference, the predictions of the two models diverge. We have now

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
A reviewer has responded to the revision and is still not fully satisfied by the reduced chi-
square analysis and the interpretation.
Many thanks for the opportunity to revise the manuscript. We found the reviewer’s
comments to be most helpful and have now included the corrected AIC values as
suggested by the reviewer. In addition, we have clarified the F-tests and modified the
text (both in the Abstract and Discussion) to indicate that the results from this study are
well fit by gain control models, and are consistent with a previous study that favored the
DKSL model.
Reviewer: 2 Comments to the Author(s)
I am happy with most of the changes made by the authors however I am now a bit
confused about the statistics.
I was aware of that when I made my previous comment about the reporting of the
reduced Chi^2 values. My suggestion that you are overfitting was based on the reduced
chi square values being less than one. The authors bring up the relationship between
reduced Chi^2 and AIC, however even AIC is prone to selecting overfitted models. For
this reason the use of corrected AICc (which introduces a greater penalty for additional
parameters) is recommended by Burnham & Anderson's (2002) Model Selection and
Multimodel Inference.
We now include the corrected AIC values in Tables 5 and 6, and provide details for both
reduced Chi^2 and corrected AIC in Supplemental Materials.
I am a little confused by the F-test that has been added because it would seem to indicate
that the additional parameters of the DKSL model would be highly justified by the
improvement they make to the quality of the fit, however if this calculation is based on
the Chi^2 values then it seems strange that the values of the reduced Chi^2 values make a
very different case.
We agree with the Referee, and note that now include a detailed description and
equations for the F-test in Supplemental Materials. Although the F-test also shows a
further improvement of fit performance by adding gain-control of gain-enhancement
(DSKL model vs. Model 2), we cannot exclude the possibility of overfitting the model to
the noise in the data because the reduced Chi-square was less than one. In this study, we
didn’t have enough data to test gain-control of gain- enhancement in the DSKL model,
although it significantly improved the model fit in our previous studies.
From what I gather the study does not provide strong evidence that the complexity of the
DKSL model is required to fit the data, over the simpler account given by Model 2.
However it does seem that the results are consistent with a previous study that *did*
favour the DKSL model (which follows necessarily, as they are nested models). I think
that the authors should make whatever changes necessary to the text to indicate that the
results from this study indicate Model 2, but are consistent with the previous DKSL
result, rather than concluding that the results from this study indicate DKSL must be
responsible.
We have modified the text (both in the Abstract and Discussion) to indicate that the
results from this study are well fit by gain control models, and are consistent with a
previous study that favored the DKSL model.
