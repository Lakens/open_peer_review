Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Pablo Gonzalez):
Dear authors,
Thanks for your effort on revisiting the text. I see that the manuscript has improved by taking
into account the reviewers comments.
However, from my own read of the manuscript, I found that some points need clarification. I
would like to give you the opportunity to streamline them and clarify the following points, before
accepting it. I have focused on the abstract, but if you want to address them it might need to add
some changes in the maintext as well.

Abstract
- Line 19: Please give some details of what type of strategic importance in a wider context for the
Sokoto region. e.g., Is it its vegetation type, urban growth model,... etc?
- Line 20: Spell out the LST (Land Surface Temperature). It is the first time that appear in the text
- Line 21: Same for GIS
- Line 26: Are the decrease of bare surface and water body in per year units? Please clarify.
- In addition, Are changes less than 2% statistically significant? My first impression is that they
small compared with the method of analysis/classification and the size of the area analyzed.
Please provide an error estimation, and/or revisit the abstract text for those land cover types.
- Finally, what could be a reason for the positive correlation between urban growth and LST?
Figure 3b seems to be affected by some Landsat sensor stripping effect. Is that the case? That
might compromise the LST estimation to be compared with 1986 and 2016 images.

Dear Dr Orimoloye,
I am pleased to inform you that your manuscript entitled "Spatio-temporal Analysis of Land Use
Dynamics and its Potential Indications on Land Surface Temperature in Sokoto Metropolis,
Nigeria." is now accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
You can expect to receive a proof of your article in the near future. Please contact the editorial
office (openscience_proofs@royalsociety.org and openscience@royalsociety.org) to let us know if
you are likely to be away from e-mail contact. Due to rapid publication and an extremely tight

will be the final version of the paper. As such, it can be cited immediately by other researchers.
As the issue version of your paper will be the only version to be published I would advise you to
check your proofs thoroughly as changes cannot be made once the paper is published.
On behalf of the Editors of Royal Society Open Science, we look forward to your continued
contributions to the Journal.

COMMENTS TO THE EDITORS AND AUTHORS:
The authors present interesting information on natural landscapes dynamics and
its potential implication of land surface temperature (1986 – 2016) with
emphasis on land use land change. Their study assessed the land surface
temperature and it found varied spatially for all the images as a result of
different land covers of the land surface with their different thermal
characteristics. This study has revealed an existence of negative relationship
between built-up area and land surface temperature over the area.
Result further revealed that there exists a drastic change in change in bare soil
and built-up area, while bare soil decreased throughout the study periods and
built-up increased all through and have contributed immensely to the
development of urban climate in the area.
The manuscript is well written, has an important environmental message, and
should be of great interest to the readers. However, there are a couple of other
minor issues that I mention in the “comments to the authors below”. Overall, it
is an important study, and should be considered for publication in RSOS, once
the minor correction and adjustment have been resolved.
Abstract
Well written, but author should rephrase long sentences
Introduction
I will suggest that author should revise the introduction section and pay more
attention to use of punctuation. More so, author should rephrase long sentences
in the text.
Methods
In accuracy assessment section more still need to be done as the accuracy and
omission errors were not well presented. Author should revise and gives the
percentage of the accuracies.
Result and Discussion
Pg. 13 line 33, remove at after rate and replace it accordingly.
Conclusion
Appropriate
