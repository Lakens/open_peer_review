The MS picked up quite interesting topic. However, the authors need additional control
condition before publication. Presence of DM itself may facilitate learning, eating behavior may
facilitate learning, entering the arms may facilitate learning. To exclude such possibility,
following control conditions are necessary.

Rats learned to find food in the radial-arm maze. Their learning was faster if they observed
another demonstrator rat learned to do so and the speed of learning (learning efficiency in the
authors’ word) positively correlated with that of the demonstrator.
I find this report interesting. A novel point is that the observer rats watched the learning process
of the demonstrator. In most previous studies on social learning, observers were exposed to the
learned, not learning, demonstrators. It thus suggests that rats can learn something from
inefficiently behaving models. This is intriguing.
However, I feel that this finding may be more suited to specialized journals on comparative
psychology than general ones like this, Royal Society Open Science.

Although I enjoyed reading this for most part, I find several important points somewhat
problematic, opaque, or unclearly stated. I raise them below.
1. In lines 100-102, the authors write “An eight-arm radial maze with ecological validity was
used.” What does this “ecological validity” mean? The first impression of this statement is that
the authors’ may have devised a new type of maze because the traditional ones are ecologically
inappropriate. Clearly it is not the fact. This phrase should be simply deleted.
2. In the Methods section, I find no description of the sex of subjects. I assume all were the same
sexes because they were “randomly allocated into pairs (line 123). But are they males or females?
Also the age of the subjects at the beginning of training is not stated, although it seems 10 weeks
because the training started “5 weeks after purchase (line 135)” and the purchase was at 5 weeks
old (line 122).
3. In the description of Apparatus, a wire-mesh cage was used to restrain observer rats in the
central arena. Because this cage was rectangular-shaped, I wonder which orientation the cage was
placed and whether the orientation was constant or varied across trials.
4. A duplication of the description of the reward and placement is found in line 144 and line149.
5. Regarding the training procedure, were the baited locations same across trials or changed
every time? This is a critically important point. If we judge the term “learning efficiency” that the
authors use later, placement is changed every day and thus the rats learn how to learn. Is this
correct? If no, the rats learn food locations in a long-term memory? In this case the orientation of
the observer’s cage is critically important because it changes the within-maze cues. Which is
correct?
6. In lines 154 and 155, trials seem to be referred to as sessions. I think “trials” are used in all other
places.
7. In line 159, where and in what orientation did the demonstrator rat placed? This is related to
the question #3 above.
8. In line 162, in placing the observer rat, was the observer’s cage still there? where and in what
orientation did the observer rat placed? These information is important because they may affect
how the observer learn.
9. In line 165, the rats in the waiting group spent some time probably in the same wire-mesh
observation cage as used for the observer, but this is never stated.
10. In line 168, was the observation cage rats there in the individual group?
11. ln line 174, what is the “transit time” ?
12. In the Results section, the authors write that “the behaviour in the radial maze is a metaphor
of foraging in the wild.” I am sceptic about this statement. At the least, this statement is not called
for in the Results section.
13. I am not sure of the difference between the two analyses shown in Figs 2 and 3.
14. In lines 339, the authors write “it would be difficult for the observer to learn another rat’s
semantic-like memory.” What is the “semantic-like” memory?
15. In lines 359-361,the authors write “We have provided evidence that only the presence of other
rats before the task facilitates task performance.” This does not look like the fact found in this
report. Otherwise it need a reference.

label_comment_3
I reviewed the original submission of this paper. This new version is much improved. A major
point of my previous review is that this paper may be more suited to journals specialized to
animal learning and animal cognition. I still hold the same feeling.
7
In all other aspects, I enjoyed reading this. A strongest point is that rats learned something from
conspecifics currently learning (not having learned) efficient foraging in the radial-arm maze.
This is an intriguing new finding. I have only minor comments listed below.
1. Lines 53-54. In the introduction, the authors cite three papers on social learning study. Whereas
these studies handled only apes and humans, the authors write incorrectly “humans,
chimpanzees and monkeys, can learn efficient strategies from others.” Cite more papers on
monkey social learning.
2. Line 79. I believe Bartel et al (2011) used a tube to restrain a rat, not a cage.
3. Line 80. In Sato et al (2015), rats were in fact in the water, but I do not think they were
drowning (otherwise this test might not have been approved).
4. Lines from 137. Animals. The numbers of rats in each of the 4 groups should be moved to here
from the top of the “Results” section (Lines 214-215).
5. Description of the Apparatus is now clear. The photo in Figure 1 helps a lot.
6. Lines 197-199. I do not understand “The interaction between trial number and each condition
was computed by multiplying the standardized trial number by each condition.” Please clarify.
7. Lines 253-255. The authors write “The results indicated that the learning progress in the
demonstrator group was qualitatively different from that in individual and other groups…”
Where is the evidence for the qualitative difference? The learning curves look alike, thought there
are significant differences in the speed of learnin.
8. Lines 312-314. The authors write “This indicates that observer rats did not improve searching
efficiency by merely observing the demonstrators, but by observing the behaviour and deducing
the most efficient strategy based on these behaviours.” This statement has two problems. First,
the first half is not what was obtained. Observer rats learned by “merely observing” the
demonstrators. Second, the latter half has no supporting evidence.
9. Lines 328-329. The authors write “our findings showed that observational learning may not be
due to simple behaviour imitation as previously thought.” This statement also has two problems.
First, what is the “behavior imitation” here? Copying actions? Do not use the term “imitation”
here, as it is usually used with a very specific meaning. Second, observational learning includes
variously different processes (see many papers by Whiten and colleagues) and researchers in this
field did not previously think it to be a simple “behavior imitation.”
10. Line 359. The authors write “the demonstrator rats were inhibited by the presence of the
observer while they were not accustomed enough to the maze to forage in it.” I think “while they
were not…” may be easier to understand by saying “before they were accustomed enough…”
11. Lines 369-370. I was puzzled by the statement “We would provide new evidence…”
12. Lines 385-386. I was also puzzled by “we showed that observers did not improve the
searching efficiency only by observing the demonstrators…” This contradicts with the present
finding. Perhaps the authors want to say that the observers more deeply processed the behavior
of the demonstrator but this is no more than a speculation. See the comment #8 above.
13. Finally, I am eager to know is how this learning by observers is different from traditional
observational learning; I mean, is this more efficient? If so it implies observing errors may be
more important than observing successes. The answer to this question requires additional test
and I am a bit discouraged by the lack of this further analysis.

This is an important paper. I like it a lot. It is the rat equivalent of (painfully) watching another
person type and then getting the chance to do so. If the results in rat pertain to humans (likely in
my opinion) they would suggest that after watching another person flail around we will type a
bit more efficiently than if we hadn't watched the flailing.
A few key points should be clarified. They are sufficiently important that additional sentences are
warranted to make sure that the reader understands the paradigm.
First, I remain confused by the observer trials. What I get from the manuscript is that an observer
in a cage watches a demonstrator rat get all the 4 food baits. Then I am unclear as to 1) when the
observer is tested. Is it after each demonstrator trial so that demonstrator and observer trials are
alternated on either the same day or alternate days? or is it after weeks of demonstrator trials?
and 2) when the observer gets a chance to hunt the food baits, who is in the central cage? Is it
empty or does it contain the previous demonstrator (also the cagemate) or does it contain some
other rat (a stranger)?
Second, did the rats spend any time near the central cage? Given the results from David Eilam's
laboratory, one might expect that they delay exploring the arms in order to be near the observer
rat. And was there an observer rat in the central cage for the control conditions? Please clarify
how many rats were on the apparatus for the observer and the two control conditions. If the
number of rats varied, then this should be discussed as a possible confounding factor (see T
Kikusui review on social buffering).
If any substantial time was spent in the central area, that should be reported as it is not
appropriately part of the denominator by which searching efficiency should be calculated. This
issue is one of the important reasons why it is critical that the authors clarify how much time was
spent in the center across different conditions and how many rats (0 or 1) were in the center in
each condition.
There are some minor corrections that need to be attended to:
78 Bartel should be Ben-Ami Bartal
80 The Sato rats were not drowning. They were in a pool but they held on to the side and were
never in danger of drowning. The term used was "soaked"
345 There IS another POSSIBLE explanation
Fig. 4 uses the term "learning efficiency" whereas everywhere else, including the legend, the term
"searching efficiency" is used. Please fix.

In this experiment, rats were given the opportunity to observe their cagemates navigate a baited
maze from the vantage point of an enclosure placed at the center of the maze. Rats that observed
a cagemate fumble around with the task ended up doing better faster than did rats who were
placed in the central enclosure without their cagemate being placed in the maze. Moreover the
cagemates with the rats in the center enclosure learned to obtained bait more slowly than did rats
who navigated the maze alone and without a witness, suggestive of distraction. The authors
conclude that rats can learn through observation.
This revision is clearer and now I understand the paradigm. Movie is very nice. Unfortunately
now that I understand the paradigm I am of the opinion that an important control is missing. No
condition controls for the presence of two rats in the observer condition. The controls (waiting,
individual) involved testing single rats. Thus, the manipulation studied could be confounded by
a social buffering effect. A condition in which the demonstrator rat did not demonstrate (because
there were no baits placed in the maze or because all arms were baited) but all else was held
constant would not only control for the presence of two rather than one rats but would also
greatly illuminate the information that is being transferred from demonstrator to observer. The
possibility exists, for example that what observer rats are learning is that they won’t be eaten if
they go into the maze arms, ie that the maze is safe. This is a very different lesson than a search
strategy. I would urge the authors to perform this experiment.
No regressions are shown. Regression lines with averaged data are shown but the point of a
regression is to see the goodness of the fit and that requires seeing the data points and not simply
the average values. Regression plots should be shown.
I do not understand why three conditions – observer, demonstrator and waiting – were all given
the same categorical value (1). Even though the power of the conclusions rests in the correlation
between demonstrator and observer efficiency. I think in general an expanded explanation of the
use of the dummy variable would be useful.
235 It is just non-sensical that “The greater this value is, the more poorly the rat collected the
pellets.” Rename or take the reciprocal of this measure. “Efficiency” metric should increase with
greater efficiency NOT poorer efficiency. This nomenclature leads to the impossible sentence:
“Results showed that trial number correlated negatively 245 with efficiency [b = -0.82, SE = 0.05, t
(115) = -15.32, p < 0.001], suggesting 246 that searching efficiency increased as the trials
progressed.” Thus “efficiency” is inverse to “searching efficiency”
333 Correlation is the other way around. Observer efficiency (y) was correlated to demonstrator
efficiency (x)
219 “rearing (standing upright on the hind legs), which is related to vigilance, arousal and
exploring---- that is a lot of conflated variables
357 These findings indicate- SUGGEST- that the demonstrators were distracted from learning by
the presence of the observer during the initial stages of learning
In other words, rats may not learn from other rats’ experience. -----? 385-6 This appears to
completely contradict the point of this work.
“The day before the experiment, approximately 6 g laboratory chow and 14 g sucrose pellets were
given to each cage.” WHY?

In this experiment, rats were given the opportunity to observe their cagemates navigate a baited
maze from the vantage point of an enclosure placed at the center of the maze. Rats that observed
a cagemate fumble around with the task ended up doing better faster than did rats who were
placed in the central enclosure without their cagemate being placed in the maze. Moreover the
cagemates with the rats in the center enclosure learned to obtained bait more slowly than did rats
who navigated the maze alone and without a witness, suggestive of distraction. The authors

Appendix A
Dear Editor
In your letter of 28 Aug 2016, you offered to reconsider the possible publication of our paper, entitled,
"Learning of efficient strategy in spatial exploration through observational learning in rats," after we had
amended many parts in accordance with the suggestions by reviewers. We have completed amendment
and enclose revised version of our manuscript.
We would make responses to each comment of reviewers as below.
·Comments from Reviewer: 1
The MS picked up quite interesting topic. However, the authors need additional control condition before
publication.
Presence of DM itself may facilitate learning, eating behavior may facilitate learning, entering the arms
may facilitate learning. To exclude such possibility , following control conditions are necessary.
4) Baited arms for DM and those for OBS are different.
5) Each arm is baited for DM but four arms are baited for OBS.
6) DM is already well trained at start of observation training.
·Response to reviewer 1
We appreciate your many useful suggestions. We would like to respond to your comments as follow.
First, we understand that you would like us to add some experiments for improving our study. However,
unfortunately, we are impossible to do the additional experiments because the animal laboratory
wherein we conducted the experiments has been shut down because of the policy of our prior affiliation
(NTT Communication Laboratories). Therefore, we would like to respond to your comments by explaining
the existing results or adding some descriptions as limitations of this research.
Second, we consider it highly unlikely that the presence of the demonstrator itself affects the learning
efficiency of the observer because the results from regression analysis showed that learning efficiency of
the demonstrator significantly affects learning efficiency of the observer, even when we controlled the
effect of time course of trials. Therefore, it is considered that at least the behaviour of observer was
affected by the behaviour of demonstrator, but NOT by the presense of the demonstrator itself.
Third, we agree with your comment that what kind of the demonstrator’s behavior (eating behavior or
entering into arm) affects improving learning efficiency of the observer is still unclear. Therefore, we
added some description in the Discussion section (p.13line 384 as below: “However, we would like to
mention that there is still a remaining issue concerning the mechanisms of the findings of the study.
Although we showed that observers did not improve the searching efficiency only by observing the
demonstrators, the kinds of behaviour of the demonstrator that improves searching efficiency in
observer rats remains unclear. For instance, it was possible that an observer behaved on the basis of
several kinds of searching-relevant behaviour of a demonstrator, such as running, rearing, and eating.
Therefore, further studies are needed to explore the actual mechanism of observational learning in rats.”
In addition, we amended the title of the paper as below: “Learning of efficient behaviour in spatial
exploration through observation of behaviour of conspecifics in laboratory rats".
·Comments from Reviewer: 2
Rats learned to find food in the radial arm maze. Their learning was faster if they observed another
demonstrator rat learned to do so and the speed of learning (learning eficiency in the authors’ word)
positively correlated with that of the demonstrator.
I find this report interesting. A novel point is that the observer rats watched the learning process of the
demonstrator.
In most previous studies on social learning, observers were exposed to the learned, not learning,
demonstrators. It thus suggests that rats can learn something from inefficiently behaving models. This is
intriguing. However, I feel that this finding may be more suited to specialized journals on comparative
psychology than general ones like this, Royal Society Open Science.
Although I enjoyed reading this for most part, I find several important points somewhat problematic,
opaque, or unclearly stated. I raise them below.
·Response to reviewer 2
We appreciate your many useful comments. We have now amended our research paper in accordance
with your suggestions. As you suggested, our research findings would mainly impact the research in the
field of animal behaviour. However, we consider that this finding may significantly impact other research
fields, such as social neuroscience, behavioral pharmacology, and social psychology because many
researchers in these fields have recently been interested in social information processing in rodents. We
added some description for this in conclusion (p.13 line 395) as below: “This means that rats may be
using social information from other conspecifics for conducting efficient behaviour, much more than
previously thought. Additionally, our procedure for assessing observation learning in rats will be useful in
neuroscientific research and/or pharmacological research for exploring neural mechanisms of social
information processing in rodents”. We, therefore, hope to publish this research in the Royal Society
Open Science to make it accessible to researchers of several fields.
1. In lines 100-102, the authors write “An eight arm radial maze with ecological validity was used.” What
does this “ecological validity” mean? The first impression of this statement is that the authors’ may have
devised a new type of maze because the traditional ones are ecologically inappropriate. Clearly it is not
the fact. This phrase should be simply deleted
>Thank you for your suggestion. As you pointed out, the meaning of the phrase “ecological validity” is
ambiguous in this context. Therefore, we have deleted the phrase according to your suggestion.
2. In the Methods section, I find no description of the sex of subjects. I assume all were the same sexes
because they were “randomly allocated into pairs (line 123). But are they males or females? Also the
age of the subjects at the beginning of training is not stated, although it seems 10 weeks because the
training started “5 weeks after purchase (line 135)” and the purchase was at 5 weeks old (line 122).
>Thank you for pointing out these omissions. All subjects in our study were male rats. We added a
description for this in p.5 line 121. In addition, we have added some description for age of the subjects
at the beginning of training in p.5 line 135.
3. In the description of Apparatus, a wire mesh cage was used to restrain observer rats in the central
arena. Because this cage was rectangular shaped, I wonder which orientation the cage was placed and
whether the orientation was constant or varied across trials.
> The entrance to the wire mesh cage was at one of the shorter sides of the rectangular shape. The
entrance was directed to the entrance of the experimentation room, and the orientation of the cage was
constant across trials. The size of the wire mesh cage was enough for the observer rat to change his
direction. The observer, therefore, could have changed his direction at any time in the observation room
during the trials of the demonstrator. We added some description for this point in p.5 line 140.
4. A duplication of the description of the reward and placement is found in line 144 and line149.
>Thank you for pointing out the duplication. We deleted the duplicated content of the description in line
149.
5. Regarding the training procedure, were the baited locations same across trials or changed every time?
This is a critically important point. If we judge the term “learning efficiency” that the authors use later,
placement is changed every day and thus the rats learn how to learn. Is this correct? If no, the rats
learn food locations in a long term memory? In this case the orientation of the observer’s cage is
critically important because it changes the within maze cues. Which is correct?
> The correct arms (baited locations) were the same across trials. We corrected some description of the
training procedure in p.6 line 152. As you pointed out in this case, the term "learning efficiency" may be
misleading in usual animal learning behaviour research; thus, we replaced the term it with “searching
efficiency” in the entire manuscript. However, as you see from the results, rats gradually exhibited
efficient searching behaviour, implying that rats eventually made minimum unnecessary movements,
such as moving around each one arm for long time. In other words, it means that rats acquired
economical behaviour that made them concentrate exclusively on running towards correct arms and
getting rewards. Considering these things, as you pointed out, we agree that rats may acquire efficient
behaviour gradually as long-term memory. However, the tendency of acquiring efficient behaviour was
not only observed in observer condition but also in all other conditions. This phenomenon of the
searching efficiency in observer condition being higher than in any other condition has already been
observed in previous trials. We, therefore, consider that high searching efficiency in observer condition
relative to other conditions cannot be explained by learning of food location based on long-term
memory.
Aside from this, we believe that there is an important point relevant to “long-term memory”. The point is
that the observer had to memorize behavioral tendency of the demonstrator because there was a time
delay between the conduct of task by the demonstrator and that by the observer in our study. We,
therefore, consider that the efficient searching behaviour in the observer would base on long-term
memory for the behaviour of the demonstrator. We added some description in p.13 line 374 as below:
“In addition, there is an important point to be emphasized in this context. In a previous study, the
demonstrator and observer conducted tasks concurrently so the observer did not require memorizing
demonstrator’s behavioural tendency. However, in our study, as noted above, there was a time delay
between the conduct of task by the demonstrator and that by the observer. The mechanism of
improvement of searching efficiency in the observer, therefore, would possibly be based on retaining the
long-term memory of the behavioural tendency of the demonstrator”.
With regards to the point that the orientation of the cage may have been cues within maze, the
orientation of the cage was consistent across all conditions; therefore, we consider that it cannot explain
the reason why the observer acquired effective searching behaviour relative to other groups.
6. In lines 154 and 155, trials seem to be referred to as sessions. I think “trials” are used in all other
places.
> We have now corrected this to “trials”.
7. In line 159, where and in what orientation did the demonstrator rat placed? This is related to the
question #3 above.
>In all four groups, a rat was put in the centre of the arena toward the direction of the entrance of
observation room. We added this description in p.6 line156.
8. In line 162, in placing the observer rat, was the observer’s cage still there? where and in what
orientation did the observer rat placed? These information is important because they may affect how the
observer learn.
>Yes. The observation room was kept at the centre of the arena during observer’s trials. As stated in the
response to #7, as same as other groups, a rat in the observer group was put with the direction of the
entrance of the observation room. We added some description in p.6 line 170.
9. In line 165, the rats in the waiting group spent some time probably in the same wire mesh
observation cage as used for the observer, but this is never stated.
>Thank you for pointing this out. We have now added the description “in the observation room in
common with the observer rats without the demonstrator” in p.6 line 174.
10. In line 168, was the observation cage rats there in the individual group?
>Yes. The observation room was kept in all four groups during trials. We added the description “The
observation room was kept at centre of the arena as in other groups” in p.7 line 178.
11. ln line 174, what is the “transit time” ?
> As one of indices of performance, we used the word “transit time” as the duration that animals
required to visit the four correct arms since the start of the trial. We added some explanation for it in
p.7 line 182.
12. In the Results section, the authors write that “the behaviour in the radial maze is a metaphor of
foraging in the wild.” I am sceptic about this statement. At the least, this statement is not called for in
the Results section.
>Thank you for pointing it out. We deleted the statement from the Results section.
13. I am not sure of the difference between the two analyses shown in Figs 2 and 3.
> The data of Fig.2 represents the change of “learning efficiency” with trial-by-trial. We analysed this
data by multiple regression analysis to examine the overall trend of change of “learning efficiency” in all
groups. We added a description for it in the caption of Fig.2. The data of Fig.3 represents the weekly
change in “learning efficiency” after computing weekly averaged data from each trial. We analysed the
data by conducting ANOVA to examine in detail the time point at which there are differences between
the groups. We used weekly averaged data because each trial data was too much for us to perform
ANOVA. We added a description for it in the caption of Fig.3.
14. In lines 339, the authors write “it would be difficult for the observer to learn another rat’s semantic
like memory.” What is the “semanticlike” memory?
> As you pointed out, the mean of the term “semantic-like memory” is ambiguous and it would be not
appropriate in this context. We have, therefore, deleted the term and corrected the description as
below: “the observer did not memorize the simple association between the position of demonstrator and
the presence of reward at the position.” in p.12 line 349.
15. In lines 359-361, the authors write “We have provided evidence that only the presence of other rats
before the task facilitates task performance.” This does not look like the fact found in this report.
Otherwise it need a reference.
> As you pointed out, the description is misleading because the fact is new finding in this report. We
amended the description (p.13 line 369) as below: “We would provide new evidence that searching
efficiency of observer rat was facilitated even only observing the behavior of other rat before conducting
the task”.

Dear Dr. Dunn
Senior Publishing Editor
Royal Society Open Science
We are most greatful you and the reviewers for the helpful comments on the earlier version of our
manuscript. We have addressed all the comments by reviewer 2 and 3, and indicated on the below, and
we hope that our explanations and revisions are satisfactory.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
I reviewed the original submission of this paper. This new version is much improved. A major point of
my previous review is that this paper may be more suited to journals specialized to animal learning and
animal cognition. I still hold the same feeling.
In all other aspects, I enjoyed reading this. A strongest point is that rats learned something from
conspecifics currently learning (not having learned) efficient foraging in the radial-arm maze. This is an
intriguing new finding. I have only minor comments listed below.
We appreciate your many useful comments. We have modified our manuscript in accordance with your
suggestions. First, we have conducted an additional analysis of the number of rearing behaviours per
arm as another index of efficient behaviour and added a description of it. Additionally, we now present
an actual film clip of the searching behaviour of rats in the observer and demonstrator conditions to
facilitate the reader’s understanding. We hope these additional data support our claim that observer rats
acquired more efficient behaviour than demonstrators. For more details, please see below.
Q1. Lines 53-54. In the introduction, the authors cite three papers on social learning study. Whereas
these studies handled only apes and humans, the authors write incorrectly “humans, chimpanzees and
monkeys, can learn efficient strategies from others.” Cite more papers on monkey social learning.
R1. Thank you for pointing this out. We have added some references related to the observation learning
of monkeys (see references 4 and 5).
Q2. Line 79. I believe Bartel et al (2011) used a tube to restrain a rat, not a cage.
R2. Thank you for pointing this out. We have changed this word.
Q3. Line 80. In Sato et al (2015), rats were in fact in the water, but I do not think they were drowning
(otherwise this test might not have been approved).
R3. Thank you for pointing this out; it was our mistake. We have changed the word ‘drowning’ to
‘soaked’.
Q4. Lines from 137. Animals. The numbers of rats in each of the 4 groups should be moved to here from
the top of the “Results” section (Lines 214-215).
R.4 Thank you for pointing this out. We have moved the phrase from the ‘Results’ section to the
‘Animals’ section.
Q5. Description of the Apparatus is now clear. The photo in Figure 1 helps a lot.
R5. Thanks! We are very pleased to hear this.
Q6. Lines 197-199. I do not understand “The interaction between trial number and each condition was
computed by multiplying the standardized trial number by each condition.” Please clarify.
R6. We are sorry to confuse you. We have modified the statement at three points. First, we originally
used the phrase ‘the interaction between trial number and each condition’, but this was incorrect. We
have modified it to ‘the interaction term between the trial number and dummy variables of each
condition’. Second, our calculations of the interaction terms were erroneous. We calculated the
interaction terms using a standardized trial number at first, but trial number is not a continuous
variable, so we re-calculated the interaction term using the trial number as it is. The outcomes of the
analysis were exactly the same as before. Third, we added a description showing the significance of
adding interaction terms.
Q7. Lines 253-255. The authors write “The results indicated that the learning progress in the
demonstrator group was qualitatively different from that in individual and other groups…” Where is the
evidence for the qualitative difference? The learning curves look alike, thought there are significant
differences in the speed of learnin.
R7. We completely agree with your comment. We have deleted the word ‘qualitatively’ from the phrase.
Q8. Lines 312-314. The authors write “This indicates that observer rats did not improve searching
efficiency by merely observing the demonstrators, but by observing the behaviour and deducing the
most efficient strategy based on these behaviours.” This statement has two problems. First, the first half
is not what was obtained. Observer rats learned by “merely observing” the demonstrators. Second, the
latter half has no supporting evidence.
R8. We appreciate your note. We confess the statement was confusing and misleading, as you point out.
In this paragraph, our main claim was that observers improve searching efficiency by observing
demonstrators. We have thus modified the statement in this way.
Q9. Lines 328-329. The authors write “our findings showed that observational learning may not be due
to simple behaviour imitation as previously thought.” This statement also has two problems. First, what
is the “behavior imitation” here? Copying actions? Do not use the term “imitation” here, as it is usually
used with a very specific meaning. Second, observational learning includes variously different processes
(see many papers by Whiten and colleagues) and researchers in this field did not previously think it to
be a simple “behavior imitation.”
R9. Thanks for your suggestion. We agree with you. On the first point, we modified the expression
‘behaviour imitation’ to ‘copying actions’, as you suggested. In addition, on the second point, we deleted
the statement ‘as previously thought’, because it was misleading.
Q10. Line 359. The authors write “the demonstrator rats were inhibited by the presence of the observer
while they were not accustomed enough to the maze to forage in it.” I think “while they were not…” may
be easier to understand by saying “before they were accustomed enough…”
R10. We appreciate your suggestion. We have modified our statement in accordance with it.
Q11. Lines 369-370. I was puzzled by the statement “We would provide new evidence…”
R11. We are sorry to have puzzled you. The statement was not crucial and its meaning was unclear, so
we decided to delete it.
Q12. Lines 385-386. I was also puzzled by “we showed that observers did not improve the searching
efficiency only by observing the demonstrators…” This contradicts with the present finding. Perhaps the
authors want to say that the observers more deeply processed the behavior of the demonstrator but this
is no more than a speculation. See the comment #8 above.
R12. We apologize for perplexing you. As you noted, the statement contradicted our findings, so we
have modified it to read ‘Although we showed that observers improve their search efficiency through
observing the behaviour of demonstrators’.
Q13. Finally, I am eager to know is how this learning by observers is different from traditional
observational learning; I mean, is this more efficient? If so it implies observing errors may be more
important than observing successes. The answer to this question requires additional test and I am a bit
discouraged by the lack of this further analysis.
R13. We appreciate your thoughtful comment. We agree with your thought that the results in efficiency
were insufficient to provide the evidence for the efficient behaviour of the observer. Therefore, we
conducted additional analysis of the number of rearing behaviours per arm as an index of efficient
strategic behaviours. We found that the number of rearing behaviours per arm in the observer was lower
than in all other conditions. We consider that this result may be further evidence of the efficient
behaviour of the observer. In addition, we provide a film clip showing actual rat behaviour in the
apparatus to help understand the difference between the observer and the demonstrator.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is an important paper. I like it a lot. It is the rat equivalent of (painfully) watching another person
type and then getting the chance to do so. If the results in rat pertain to humans (likely in my opinion)
they would suggest that after watching another person flail around we will type a bit more efficiently
than if we hadn't watched the flailing.
A few key points should be clarified. They are sufficiently important that additional sentences are
warranted to make sure that the reader understands the paradigm.
We appreciate your thoughtful comments. We have modified our manuscript in accordance with your
suggestions. As detailed in our response to reviewer 2, we have added data and a description of the
number of rearing behaviours per arm to strengthen our claim, with a focus on the behaviour of the
observer.
Q1 & 2. First, I remain confused by the observer trials. What I get from the manuscript is that an
observer in a cage watches a demonstrator rat get all the 4 food baits. Then I am unclear as to 1) when
the observer is tested. Is it after each demonstrator trial so that demonstrator and observer trials are
alternated on either the same day or alternate days? or is it after weeks of demonstrator trials? and 2)
when the observer gets a chance to hunt the food baits, who is in the central cage? Is it empty or does
it contain the previous demonstrator (also the cagemate) or does it contain some other rat (a
stranger)?
R1. We tested observer trials after the demonstrator trials, on the same day.
R2. When the observer explored to hunt food bait, the central cage was empty.
Q3. Second, did the rats spend any time near the central cage? Given the results from David Eilam's
laboratory, one might expect that they delay exploring the arms in order to be near the observer rat.
And was there an observer rat in the central cage for the control conditions? Please clarify how many
rats were on the apparatus for the observer and the two control conditions. If the number of rats varied,
then this should be discussed as a possible confounding factor (see T Kikusui review on social
buffering).
If any substantial time was spent in the central area, that should be reported as it is not appropriately
part of the denominator by which searching efficiency should be calculated. This issue is one of the
important reasons why it is critical that the authors clarify how much time was spent in the center
across different conditions and how many rats (0 or 1) were in the center in each condition.
R3. We greatly appreciate your constructive comments. In fact, the number of rats in the apparatus was
different in the demonstrator and other conditions. We agree with the possibility you note that the
behaviour of demonstrators in the central arena can be affected by the presence of observers, especially
early in the learning period. Of course, we also consider the behaviour of demonstrator to be interesting.
However, the main focus of this paper is whether the behaviour of rats in the observer condition is
improved through observation of the behaviour of rats in the demonstrator condition. As we noted at p.9
line 255, we found that the rats in the observer condition have more efficient behaviour than in any
other conditions, although the number of the rats in the observer condition in the apparatus was not
different from the control condition. The main findings, therefore, were not affected by the number of
rats in the apparatus. The setting of this study was insufficient to examine the effects of the presence of
the observer on the behaviour of the demonstrator. To clarify what affects the behaviour of
demonstrator, we need to conduct a study in a different setting (e.g., setting up multiple cameras to
record the interactions between the demonstrator and the observer).
There are some minor corrections that need to be attended to:
Q4. 78 Bartel should be Ben-Ami Bartal
R4. Thank you for pointing this out. We have modified it.
Q5. 80 The Sato rats were not drowning. They were in a pool but they held on to the side and were
never in danger of drowning. The term used was "soaked"
R5. We appreciate your note. We have modified the word ‘drowning to ‘soaked’ accordingly.
Q6. 345 There IS another POSSIBLE explanation
R6. Thanks. We have corrected the error.
Q7. Fig. 4 uses the term "learning efficiency" whereas everywhere else, including the legend, the term
"searching efficiency" is used. Please fix.
R7. Many thanks for your note. We have fixed the term.
Appendix C
We are most grateful to reviewer 3 for the helpful comments on the earlier version of our manuscript.
We have addressed all the comments by reviewer 3 and we hope that our explanations and revisions are
satisfactory.
The following is our responses to the reviewer's comments.
Q1.This revision is clearer and now I understand the paradigm. Movie is very nice. Unfortunately now
that I understand the paradigm I am of the opinion that an important control is missing. No condition
controls for the presence of two rats in the observer condition. The controls (waiting, individual) involved
testing single rats. Thus, the manipulation studied could be confounded by a social buffering effect. A
condition in which the demonstrator rat did not demonstrate (because there were no baits placed in the
maze or because all arms were baited) but all else was held constant would not only control for the
presence of two rather than one rats but would also greatly illuminate the information that is being
transferred from demonstrator to observer. The possibility exists, for example that what observer rats
are learning is that they won’t be eaten if they go into the maze arms, ie that the maze is safe. This is a
very different lesson than a search strategy. I would urge the authors to perform this experiment.
R1. We greatly appreciate your thoughtful comment. We understand your suggestion that the social
buffering effect might affect the behaviour of demonstrators. Unfortunately, we cannot conduct an
experiment to verify this, because conducting such an experiment would require a greater amount of
time than we had available. Further, adding such a condition would confound our interpretation of the
data, because it would alter the number of baited arms between the observer and other conditions. In
other words, adding such a condition could create unclear differences. As an alternative, we have added
two paragraphs explaining the possibility that the social buffering affected the results of this study (lines
414–432, lines 433–453).
Your proposal is certainly possible, but the results of regression analysis showed that the efficiency of
the demonstrator significantly predicted the efficiency of the observer even after controlling for time
series variation. If observer behaviour is based on the presence of the demonstrator itself, if the
behaviour of the demonstrator is not observed, there should be no relationships between the efficiency
data. We therefore consider that the results imply that the observer learned efficient searching
behaviour by observing the behaviour of demonstrator.
However, we greatly appreciate your pointing out the possibility that an observer might learn safety
information from the environment. We noted the possibility that observer rats learned safety information
by observing the behaviour of the demonstrator and that the observer learned efficient strategic
behaviour by observing the behaviour of the demonstrator.
We think that, from this point of view, another intriguing possibility could be suggested, that the
learning of safety in an unfavourable environment, as a difficult task for rats, was facilitated through the
observation of other conspecifics. We did not focus on this point, but it is an interesting point of this
study. We have therefore added one paragraph exploring it (lines 372–388).
Q2. No regressions are shown. Regression lines with averaged data are shown but the point of a
regression is to see the goodness of the fit and that requires seeing the data points and not simply the
average values. Regression plots should be shown.
R2. Thank you for your note on the regression plot. To analyse the effect of the time series of the trial
on efficiency, we used averaged efficiency data with respect to the trial number for each condition, not
raw data. The figure represents average data points and regression lines. We conducted an additional
regression analysis on the efficiency data using raw data and found that the overall results were the
same, although some numerical values were changed. We replaced our previous numerical values with
new ones. In accordance with your indication, we created a regression plot and replaced the previous
Fig. 2 by it.
Q3. I do not understand why three conditions – observer, demonstrator and waiting – were all given the
same categorical value (1). Even though the power of the conclusions rests in the correlation between
demonstrator and observer efficiency. I think in general an expanded explanation of the use of the
dummy variable would be useful.
R3. I apologise for the misleading explanation of the regression analysis. In the analysis, we created
three different dummy variables (demonstrator, observer and waiting) to analyse whether the search
efficiency of the demonstrator, observer and waiting conditions was different from individual condition as
control. Here, we allocated the value 1 to the applicable individuals and 0 to the non-applicable
individuals, in accordance with the general methods of regression analysis. For instance, in creating the
dummy variable ‘observer’, we allocated the value 1 to observer rats and 0 to individuals of other
conditions. We created other dummy variables in the same way. In this way, we were able to determine
which conditions are significantly different from the individual condition as control.
Q4. 235 It is just non-sensical that “The greater this value is, the more poorly the rat collected the
pellets.” Rename or take the reciprocal of this measure. “Efficiency” metric should increase with greater
efficiency NOT poorer efficiency. This nomenclature leads to the impossible sentence: “Results showed
that trial number correlated negatively 245 with efficiency [b = -0.82, SE = 0.05, t (115) = -15.32, p
< 0.001], suggesting 246 that searching efficiency increased as the trials progressed.” Thus “efficiency”
is inverse to “searching efficiency”
R4. Thank you for pointing this out. We agree with you and have renamed the index ‘efficiency’ as
‘inefficiency’, in accordance with your remark. In the discussion section, however, the word ‘efficiency’
does not refer to the index but is used in a general sense, so we decided to keep it as it is.
Q5. 333 Correlation is the other way around. Observer efficiency (y) was correlated to demonstrator
efficiency (x)
R5. Thank you for pointing this out. We have modified this in accordance with your remark.
Q6. 219 “rearing (standing upright on the hind legs), which is related to vigilance, arousal and
exploring---- that is a lot of conflated variables
R6. There is a function of vigilance and exploring in rearing, but in a broader sense it is an indicator of
change in arousal level. This is because arousal is considered to be a fundamental emotional process,
such that it is the base of the behaviour, while vigilance and exploring are the parts of the process of
attention and behaviour that result from the level of arousal. As an interpretation of the behavioural
index of this experiment, though it is possible to consider about both vigilance and exploring in this
behaviour, we mainly considered rearing as an indicator of arousal. Rearing was used as an index to
quantify the behavioural differences between OBS and the other groups.
Q7. 357 These findings indicate- SUGGEST- that the demonstrators were distracted from learning by the
presence of the observer during the initial stages of learning
In other words, rats may not learn from other rats’ experience. -----? 385-6 This appears to completely
contradict the point of this work.
R7. As you pointed out, the behaviour of the demo group was less efficient than the observation group.
Nevertheless, this shows that the demonstration and the behaviour of the observer are in an influential
relationship. It seems that ‘One man's fault is another's lesson’. Therefore, observational learning of the
type that copies the behaviour of other individuals as it is does not occur. For a detailed discussion,
please see lines 360–371.
Q8. “The day before the experiment, approximately 6 g laboratory chow and 14 g sucrose pellets were
given to each cage.” WHY?
R8. We used this treatment to prevent novel phobia against the pellets on the first day of the
experiment by habituating the animals to eat sucrose pellets on the day before the experiment.
Generally, in the radial maze task, we conduct a session of equipment adaptation before the experiment.
In this session, we disperse the reward inside the equipment and allow the animals to explore freely.
However, in this experiment, we decided to eliminate this habituation session for the following reason.
Since the purpose of this study was to find observational learning in rats, we controlled the content to be
observed by the observation group. Adding habituation sessions would change the content of the
observation in the habituation sessions and training sessions. Therefore, we gave the animals
experience of sucrose pellets, which were the reward in the experiment, and from the first day of
training, we allowed the animals to explore the maze freely.
Q9. How cleanable was the wood maze? Was cleaning with wet paper towel sufficient to clean off non-
water soluble compounds? It appears from Fig 1 that the wood may be covered with paint and possibly a
varnish. Please specify this.
R9. The inside of the wooden maze was painted with oil paint, so rat faeces and urine would not soak
into the maze, and it was cleanable with water wipes. We honestly cannot judge the traces of invisible
smell, but we conducted our experiments in the same way in all trials, and there were many rats coming
and going throughout the day. Because of this, even if smells remained in the maze, the possibility that
they were useful as a spatial clue is very low. For this reason, it is unlikely that the equipment produced
behavioural differences between the groups.
