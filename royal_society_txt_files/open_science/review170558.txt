Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
This manuscript constitutes a valuable contribution to the literature, both in providing details on
the daily and seasonal variation in dolphin acoustic activity in this particular location in the
coastal mid-Atlantic of the United States, and by addressing the potential impacts on dolphin
acoustic activity related to mine detonation activities in shallow coastal areas. Overall the
manuscript is well written and easy to follow.
The main reason for my suggestion for revision is focused on the objective "quantify the acoustic
activity of dolphins IN RESPONSE to MINEX training events". From the current presentation, it
is not clear that the documented changes are in response to the actual explosions, or potentially to
other vessel or aerial vehicle activities that are associated with the detonations. Please clarify if
you are testing whether any activities related to MINEX training are of interest, or only the
explosions specifically. Particularly, the lack of evidence for the size of the explosion to influence
the response through the modelling results suggest that other aspects of the training (duration of
all activities, level of vessel activity) may be more relevant, and should be straightforward to
assess statistically from the lower frequency sounds recorded with the units. Further, given the
resolution of the dataset, would discrete hourly measurements pre and post detonation be
feasible, rather than a coarse daily scale, to really test whether the explosions themselves are
driving the observed changes in acoustic activities?
Finally, given the very shallow water of this location, the potential detection ranges for both
dolphin sounds and detonations should be discussed through propagation modelling as this
could have significant impacts on your results and needs to be address to confirm independence
between different recording units. A description of the sensitivity and flat frequency response of
the recording system was absent from the methods.
A few specific comments on the text are included below:
Page 3, Line 33: Provide citations related to uses of sounds by marine mammals. Although this is
a general comment, it will be helpful for non-marine mammal experts reading this to have a
review or general reference to turn to for more details.
Page 3, Line 44: Make clear that U.S. federal laws are being discussed, given the international
audience of this journal.
Page 4, Line 70: Approximate bandwidth from 0-25 kHz should be clarified to discuss
sensitivity/frequency response of the recording system overall.
Page 5, Line 82: Given the water depth and sediment types, please provide an estimate of
detection range for relevant signals in the study.
Page 5, Line 121: Here you mention hourly comparison of acoustic behaviour of dolphins before
and after events, so you should have, say, 2-4 hours before and event and 2-4 hours afterwards
already in your dataset. The next section says you averaged these values over the entire daytime
and night-time periods, which could mask the before/after effect in response to explosions.
Further, in the model, you only include time since explosion, which would not allow you to
directly compare before/after in a paired fashion.

your categorization of acoustic activity level and relative abundance of dolphins, as currently it is

presenting either movement or reduced acoustic production as equally plausible explanations
previously.

water? This is why the propagation modelling is important to understand what frequency
components you were picking up at this distance.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This is a well-written paper that presents acoustic responses of (most likely) bottlenose dolphins
to underwater detonations/explosions as part of Navy MINEX training. The acoustic record
documents the year-round presence of dolphins in the area, and it sounds like this site has been
used for MINEX training for some time prior to the period of this study. It would be good to
include some additional information on both how long this site has been regularly used for
MINEX training, and whether there is evidence (from photo-identification) regarding residency
and population size of the dolphins that are being exposed to the detonations. This would
provide important context for the acoustic responses, e.g., is this a relatively small population of
dolphins that has been repeatedly exposed to detonations for a long period, versus larger
numbers of individuals moving through the area with infrequent exposures for any particular
individual. I have a number of other suggested changes/additions, listed below.
4
L90-91. How were the EARs at the other sites (6 km, 12 km) programmed?
L101-102. Would each echolocation click in a series be considered a new detection? So 100 clicks
in one series would be treated the same as 100 clicks spread over a 24-hour period? Would be
good to clarify.
L154 (and Table 3). It is a bit confusing to have an index (Table 2) that ranges from 1-4 and having
the Mean Acoustic Activity resopnse variable from 0-1, even though it appears that MAA is
simply the index divided by 4 (which is only explained in Table 3). It is also confusing as MAA is
graphed in Figures 3-5 ranging from 0 to >1. Would be good to add some text (somewhere
around L139?) to explain the relationship between the two and/or be consistent in using the same
scale for all figures/tables/analyses (scale it all to 1?).
L182-183. It would be good to include specific details on how this 10,659 h (presumably
representing 888 days, given the 50% duty cycling?) spans the almost 4 years from the first to the
last EAR deployment, e.g., adding a statement along the lines of "This represents 888 days of
recordings (at a 50% duty cycle) over the 1,423 day span of the study period." This is particularly
relevant in interpreting the 74 UNDETs/38 events recorded (i.e., they reflect one event every ~23
days), and also provides context for some of the later discussion regarding the variable
"Cumulative Hours".
L206-216 (and Figure 3). For animals that may have diel cycles, it seems somewhat arbitrary to
pick a rigid set of times for "night", when actual hours of darkness varies from ~5.5 h in summer
to 11.5 hours in winter. Diel comparisons should take into account seasonal variation in day
length. This seems most relevant for comparisons that are of behavior during "night-time hours"
(L212-213), when some of these (during the summer) may actually be during the day? Also seems
odd to lump hours from 1800-1900 as night when during June it is light out till 2200 hrs (L230).
The shading for day/night in Figure 3 is potentially quite misleading given this.
L234-247. While recognizing that acoustic activity is reported on a scale between 1 and 4, some
discussion of effect sizes for these tests should be reported, not just the results of the statistical
tests.
Discussion. In general it would be useful to refer to specific figures (and tables as appropriate) in
the Discussion, e.g., after statements like L290.
L289. Can the authors comment on the expected detection range for bottlenose dolphins on an
EAR?
L330-331. Should it be "prey fauna killed or injured by the UNDET"?
L352-355 - Is the use of three different analysts for three different periods mentioned in the
methods? If not, it should be.
L366. Are the bottlenose dolphins in Australia the same species as those in this study?
Table 1. Do the "recovery dates" correspond to when the EARs stopped recording? If there are
cases where they had stopped recording prior to the recovery date, it would probably be better to
include the End recording date instead. It would be good to add a column for # days of recording
(combined for the sites), since that would allow for a quick comparison of the number of
explosions relative to the amount of time, for example, to assess seasonality of explosions relative
to the sampling.
Table 2. Although noted in the text (L119-120) that if there was no acoustic activity the index
5
value would be 0, this should be added to the table. This would make it consistent with the
description of MAA in Table 3.
