In this work, a-Fe2O3/H2O2/UV was used as the photo-catalytic degradation system of DBP.
The effect of the operating parameters such as the morphology and dosage of Fe2O3, the initial
concentration of H2O2, the initial concentration of dibutyl phthalate and the pH of solution on
the degradation efficiency was investigated. However, some issues are need to be addressed
before its publication.
1.The physicochemical-characteristics of different morphologies Fe2O3 should be provided, such
as the PZC, particle size, surface area, and micropore volume.
2.Controlled experiments need to be conducted. How about the degradation of DBP without
Fe2O3? How about the degradation of DBP in the solution containing H2O2?
3.The light intensity of mercury lamp should be provided.
4.The preparation method for Fe2O3 should be provided or referenced.
5.Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 can be moved into the Supplementary_Material.
6.The degradation mechanism of dibutyl phthalate as shown in Fig. 1 should not be placed in the
introduction section.

This work investigate the photocatalytic degradation properties of dibutyl phthalate using a-
Fe2O3 nanoparticles. The optimal parameters and mechanism of degradation are discussed by

changing the morphology and usage amount of catalysts, the dosage of H2O2, pH value and the
initial concentration of DBP. The characterization is performed adequately and convincingly. The
results shows DBP and their intermediate are almost completely degraded to CO2 and H2O for
12h in the system of a-Fe2O3/H2O2/UV photo-catalytic degradation.
1. Check the manuscript carefully, correct the typos (eg. page 17, line 14; page 18, line 31)), the
paper is better described with present tense.
2. In the photocatalytic system, H2O2 can be photolyzed to produce hydroxyl radical group
under light irradiation, which plays a critical role in the degradation process of organics. So the
photocatalytic degradation performance is realized by H2O2 or a-Fe3O4, what’s the role of a-
Fe3O4.
3. In fig. 5, the SEM images of a-Fe3O4 with different morphology is better presented, and the
information is not specific.
4. Check the reference carefully, for example, the information of ref. 26 is 2015, 36(9),1260-1264,
the pages and value need to be corrected.

Appendix A
Dear Reviewer 1:
Thank you for your comments on manuscript entitled “Photocatalytic degradation
properties of a-Fe2O3 nanoparticles for dibutyl phthalate in aqueous solution
system” (RSOS-172196). Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for
revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding significance to our
researches. According to your comments, we have carefully revised and supplemented
this manuscript. Revised portion has been marked in red in the text.
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
Q1. .The physicochemical-characteristics of different morphologies Fe2O3 should be
provided, such as the PZC, particle size, surface area, and micropore volume.
Response: Thank you for your valuable comments, in previous work, we reported the
preparation of the a-Fe2O3 nanoparticles with different morphologies and cited the
paper in the text, and the physicochemical-characteristics of different morphologies
Fe2O3 were characterized systematically, please refer to “Hu, J, S.; Sun, N.; Li, S.;
Qin, G, W. Controllable preparation of a-Fe2O3 particles with different morphology. J.
Northeast. Univ, 2015, 36, 1260-1264”. Please refer to Page 3 of manuscript.
Q2. Controlled experiments need to be conducted. How about the degradation of DBP
without Fe2O3? How about the degradation of DBP in the solution containing H2O2?
Response: According to your opinion, in fact, the Fig. 3 shows the effect of a-Fe2O3
dosage on the degradation of dibutyl phthalate, and the degradation effect of 30 mg/L
a-Fe2O3 dosage is better than 0 mg/L a-Fe2O3 dosage (without Fe2O3). Fig 4 discusses
systematically the effect of different amounts of H2O2 on the degradation of dibutyl
phthalate.
Q3. The light intensity of mercury lamp should be provided.
Response: Thank you for your opinion, the UV high pressure mercury lamp (250 W)
emitted around 365 nm was used as a light source, please refer to Page 4 of
manuscript.
Q4. The preparation method for a-Fe2O3 should be provided or referenced.
Response: Thank you for your question, in previous work, the preparation of the
a-Fe2O3 nanoparticles was cited in the text. Please refer to Page 4 of manuscript.

Q5. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 can be moved into the Supplementary Material, please refer to
the Supplementary Material.
Response: According to your opinion, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 have been moved into the
Supplementary Material.
Q6. The degradation mechanism of dibutyl phthalate as shown in Fig. 1 should not be
placed in the introduction section.
Response: Thank you very much for your proposal, Figure 1 has been deleted.

Appendix B
Dear Reviewer 2:
Thank you for your comments on manuscript entitled “Photocatalytic degradation
properties of a-Fe2O3 nanoparticles for dibutyl phthalate in aqueous solution
system” (RSOS-172196). Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for
revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding significance to our
researches. According to your comments, we have carefully revised and supplemented
this manuscript. Revised portion has been marked in red in the text.
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
Q1. Check the manuscript carefully, correct the typos (eg. page 17, line 14; page 18,
line 31), the paper is better described with present tense.
Response: Thank you very much for your proposal. I have carefully checked the
manuscript and corrected the typos, Please refer to Page 5 an7 of manuscript.
Q2. In the photocatalytic system, H2O2 can be photolyzed to produce hydroxyl radical
group under light irradiation, which plays a critical role in the degradation process of
organics. So the photocatalytic degradation performance is realized by H2O2 or
a-Fe3O4, what’s the role of a-Fe3O4.
Response: As shown in Fig. 3, the experimental results show that the catalytic effect
of both a-Fe2O3 and H2O2 is better than the catalytic effect of adding only H2O2. The
reason is as follows. During the reaction process, the photocatalyst nano-Fe2O3
particles are excited to form photo-generated electron-hole pairs and migrate to the
catalyst table to shut down the customer. The exchange of energy and charge occurs
between the h surface and the adsorbed OH-, O2, H2O and the like Hydroxyl radical
with strong oxidizing ability • OH and so on.
Q3. In fig. 5, the SEM images of a-Fe3O4 with different morphology is better
presented, and the information is not specific.
Response: According to your opinion, I have marked the different shapes of iron
oxide from code 1 to 5 in Fig. 5. Please refer to Page 6 of manuscript .SEM images of
a-Fe3O4 with different morphology had been reported by Hu.

Q4. Check the reference carefully, for example, the information of ref. 26 is 2015,
