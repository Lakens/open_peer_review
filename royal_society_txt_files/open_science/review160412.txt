This is a solid piece of work dealing with the quantitative relationship between the me-chanical
properties (e.g. axial stiffness) and microstructure of a species of bamboo. Due to the complicated
graded hierarchical microstructural characteristics, especially the bamboo fiber bundles
composed of micro-fibril and hemicellulose-lignin complex, at the different scales, it is not easy to
develop an effective prediction model to predict the mechanical properties (es-pecially strength).
In this work, a simply appraisal procedure for the structural axial stiffness, in accordance with the
mechanical properties of the various constituents, the orientation of single microfibrils and the
dimensional distribution of fiber bundles, has been established. The axial stiffness of fiber
bundles, parenchyma and bamboo culm has been quantitatively estimated, and the results shows
that the predicted performances agree well with the measured ones in the tensile and
nanoindentation experiments. Therefore, the reviewer recommends the publication of this
manuscript after revision, upon the following comments and issues can be addressed:
1. For the entire article, so many journal papers were introduced in Introduction part. I
think that few cites (e.g. Fig.6 and Fig.7) are redundant which are not related to your paper.
However, for the development of a simple phenomenological model to describe the mechanical
stiffness, the authors may consider and compared the advantages over a few developed models
reported in other recent works (Habibi et al. Acta biomaterialia 16, 178-186, 2015; Dixon and
Gibson, J. R. Soc. Interface, 11(99), 2014)
2. The expression of Reuter’s matrix should be given.
3. The specific formula of the probability density functions P1 and P2 should be shown.
Fur-thermore, although you consider the probability density in terms of di and do, you should
point out that the specific probability value to calculate the di and do shown in the Fig. 11(b).
4. In Figure 11, more specific descriptions about how to generate the synthetic bundle
should be given.
5. In Figure 12(b), the location of specimens should be mentioned and discussed along with
whether the stiffness of fiber bundles in axial direction has a distributional regularity along the
radial direction.
6. The measured values for the stiffness of fiber bundles based on the nanoindentation tests
should be given, and compared with the calculation using eq. 5.
7. As the authors mentioned, the hierarchical structure of bamboo extends all the way
down to the nanoscale, however, the understanding of the detailed nanoscale structure of bam-
boo is very limited so far, here, in addition to the molecule simulation study by Youssefian and
Rahbar in 2015, the authors may also refer and discuss a few recent experimental and
simulational studies, such as Habibi et al. Mechanics of Materials 97, 184-198, 2016.
8. In this work, the authors mainly focus on one type of bamboo, the authors may consider
to check and evaluate their model with the experimental results from other bamboo species
(Dixon et al. Construction and Building Materials, 90, 11-17, 2015 and above mentioned other
papers)

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This is a manuscript focused on the important topic of mechanical properties of bamboo and its
components. A combination of experimental and theoretical methods was used to investigate
bamboo. In this study, the elastic modulus of bamboo fibers was estimated by using the
information about the smaller constituents. Then the mechanical properties of bamboo itself were
found experimentally and theoretically using the information about bamboo fibers and
parenchyma cells. This manuscript needs significant work and clarifications as its contribution to
the field is not really clear. There are some technical and grammatical issues that need to be
addressed.
Technical Issues:
1- In the abstract, it is mentioned that the “strength” of bamboo is studied in this
manuscript; however, there is no presented results on the strength of bamboo or the constituents.
I strongly recommend adding sections about the strength of different parts of bamboo. Overall,
strength needs more attention.
2- The introduction section needs improvement. Too much background on the structure of
bamboo and the bamboo fibers. Citations to earlier literature is sparse in some cases and should
be improved. More recent papers that have explored and synthesized the strength and toughness
of natural composites and the effect of sizes and nanoscale features should be cited, discussed
and included in the list of references.

bamboo. BioResources, 9(4), 6888-6898.
These papers can help you discuss the effect of thickness of lamellae layers in mechanical
properties of bamboo fibers.

materials. Journal of The Royal Society Interface, 12(102), 20140855.
3- Figure 13(b): This figure is meaningless; you should probably do some statistical analysis
on the nanoindentation results. I believe if you do the statistical analysis you find the modulus
around 15 GPa.
4- The number of fiber lamellae was mentioned in different sections of the manuscript.
Page 4, line 6: 8-10 Lamellae, Page 7, line 58: 5-8 Lamellae, Page9, line27: 4-8 Lamellae. Please
clarify the reason of this difference and discuss the effect of number of Lamellae layers on the
mechanical response of fibers.
5- I am wondering how many experimental results were used to determine the
probabilities in figure 10.
6- Please use error-bar in experimental results of figure 14. I assume they are not only one
experiment.
Other issues:
1- In figure 10, “di” and “do” is used for fiber bundle. These exact same terms used for
bamboo diameter in figure 14. Please fix this.
2- There are several typos in the manuscript.
<U+27A2> Page 9, Line 22.
<U+27A2> Please be consistent in the formatting of numbering the equations throughout the text.

We thank the reviewers for the insightful comments on our work. We hope that in the process of ad-
dressing them, we have improved the quality of our manuscript significantly. All page numbers in this
document refer to the revised manuscript.
Our response to comments by Reviewer 1
Comment C1.1
For the entire article, so many journal papers were introduced in Introduction part. I think that few cites
(e.g. Fig.6 and Fig.7) are redundant which are not related to your paper. However, for the development
of a simple phenomenological model to describe the mechanical stiffness, the authors may consider and
compared the advantages over a few developed models reported in other recent works (Habibi et al. Acta
biomaterialia 16, 178-186, 2015; Dixon and Gibson, J. R. Soc. Interface, 11(99), 2014).
Response R1.1
Figures 6 and 7 are not citations of other’s work but were prepared by immunolabelling the studied species
of bamboo in one of the collaborating laboratories (by JPK at the Univ Leeds). The immunolabelling
exercise is important for understanding the structure of the parenchyma and fibre cell walls completely. It
is especially useful in identifying the non-cellulosic polysaccharide components in the walls. In particular,
we have identified the presence of hemicellulosic polysaccharides such as glucuronoxylans and possibly
xyloglucans, which have helped to unravel the complete secondary cell wall structure. Though the overall
stiffness of the non-cellulosic amorphous structure surrounding the cellulose does not play a significant
part in determining the overall stiffness of the fibres, we believe that they have important role to play in
determining the overall strength.
We are aware of the works of Habibi et al. (2015) and Dixon and Gibson (2014). These papers were
brought to our notice after the manuscript was prepared. We agree with the reviewer that both of these
works are extremely relevant and have now discussed them extensively. A brief discussion has been added
in the Introduction (pp 1, paragraph 2, text in RED) while a detailed comparison between their and our
results now appear in Sec. 4.5 (pp. 14, paragraph 3, text in RED).

Comment C1.3
The specific formula of the probability density functions P1 and P2 should be shown. Furthermore, although
you consider the probability density in terms of di and do , you should point out that the specific probability
value to calculate the di and do shown in the Fig. 11(b).
Response R1.3
The probability density functions P1 (di ) and P2 (do ) are computed numerically by first measuring the
inner and outer diameters of about 200 randomly selected fibres from micrographs of the inner, middle
and outer sections of the thickness. The normalised probability distributions are generated numerically
(so that the areas under each of them is unity) and the probabilities are picked randomly from these
distributions while creating the synthetic bundles. The algorithm for choosing a random numbers x (with
a = x = b) such that they follow a given probability density p(x) is as follows (also see Fig. 7.3.2, Press
et al., 2007):
• Generate a trial value xtry such that xtry = a + (b - a)<U+03BE>1 , where <U+03BE>1 is uniform random number
between 0 and 1.
• Choose a function fx that has finite area and f (x) > p(x) for x = x = b.
• Determine p(xtry ) and f (xtry ) corresponding to xtry .
• Generate another uniform random number <U+03BE>2 between 0 and f (xtry ).
• Accept the trial value xtry only if <U+03BE>2 = p(xtry ).
The selection algorithm has been added in the manuscript on pp 10, text in RED.
Comment C1.4
In Figure 11, more specific descriptions about how to generate the synthetic bundle should be given.
Response R1.4
The Matlab code that we have designed for filling any arbitrary polygonal cross-section with randomly
centered circles with inner and outer diameters chosen in the manner described in C1.3 has been added
as supplementary material to this paper.
Comment C1.5
In Figure 12(b), the location of specimens should be mentioned and discussed along with whether the stiff-
ness of fiber bundles in axial direction has a distributional regularity along the radial direction.
Response R1.5
The fibre bundles in Fig. 12(b) are arranged such that samples 1 &2 are from the inner part, 3 & 4 from
middle and 5 & 6 are taken from the outer part. However, the diameter ranges (especially the range of
the outer diameter) of the fibres do not show a strong distributional regularity. This is also evident from
Fig. 10. Thus, the location of the fibre bundles does not seem to have a bearing on their stiffness as all
bundles are constituted of fibres with almost identical distribution of inner and outer diameters. This has
now been mentioned in the manuscript. Please see pp 12, text in RED.
Comment C1.6
The measured values for the stiffness of fiber bundles based on the nanoindentation tests should be given,
and compared with the calculation using eq. 5.
Response R1.6
Equation 5 has already been used in the computations with eq. 10 and 11. Thus the indentation moduli
shown in Fig. 13(b) already reflect the variation in the average microfibril angle from fibre to fibre.
Comment C1.7
As the authors mentioned, the hierarchical structure of bamboo extends all the way down to the nanoscale,
however, the understanding of the detailed nanoscale structure of bamboo is very limited so far, here, in
addition to the molecule simulation study by Youssefian and Rahbar in 2015, the authors may also refer
and discuss a few recent experimental and simulation studies, such as Habibi et al. Mechanics of Materials
97, 184-198, 2016.
Response R1.7
A short discussion of this interesting work mentioned by the reviewer has now been included. Please see
pp 4, text in RED.
Comment C1.8
In this work, the authors mainly focus on one type of bamboo, the authors may consider to check and
evaluate their model with the experimental results from other bamboo species (Dixon et al. Construction
and Building Materials, 90, 11-17, 2015 and above mentioned other papers).
Response R1.8
The structure property correlations between average MFA, fibre bundle distribution over the cross section
and size distribution of fibres and the stiffness of the culm has been established for a species of bamboo
that is abundantly available in northern India. Validating this structure property correlations for other
varieties of bamboo, as done by Dixon et al. (2015) (which we have now mentioned in the paper) is
a worthwhile extension of this work that we are currently attempting. Given that there are about 130
known species of bamboo available in India alone, this is a formidable task. This should be the subject
of a future paper from our group.
Our response to comments by Reviewer 2
Comment C2.1
In the abstract, it is mentioned that the strength of bamboo is studied in this manuscript; however, there is
no presented results on the strength of bamboo or the constituents. I strongly recommend adding sections
about the strength of different parts of bamboo. Overall, strength needs more attention.
Response R2.1
We agree with the reviewer. All mentions of ‘strength’ have been removed.
Comment C2.2
The introduction section needs improvement. Too much background on the structure of bamboo and the
bamboo fibers. Citations to earlier literature are sparse in some cases and should be improved. More recent
papers that have explored and synthesized the strength and toughness of natural composites and the effect
of sizes and nanoscale features should be cited, discussed and included in the list of references. You can
use the following papers to discuss the mechanical properties of bamboo:

properties of a cantilever beam of bamboo. Construction and Building Materials, 101, 784-790.

bamboo. BioResources, 9(4), 6888-6898.
These papers can help you discuss the effect of thickness of lamellae layers in mechanical properties of
bamboo fibers.

Response R2.2
The above mentioned papers suggested by the reviewer (except Askarinejad et al. (2015), which deals
with the effect of humidity on the stiffness, an important area of investigation clearly beyond the scope
of our paper) have been added in the revised manuscript.
Please see text in RED on pp 1 for Armandei et al., 2015, pp 7 for Liu et al., 2014 and pp 3 for
Wilbrink et al., 2010 and Askerinejad and Rahbar, 2015.
Comment C2.3
Figure 13(b): This figure is meaningless; you should probably do some statistical analysis on the nanoin-
dentation results. I believe if you do the statistical analysis you find the modulus around 15 GPa.
Response R2.3
The problem with comparing the experimentally determined indentation moduli against those computed
from eqs. 10 and 11 is that we do not know the MFA value under the indenter in experiments. The
computed values of the indentation moduli, on the other hand, are functions of MFA. However, we agree
with the reviewer that this figure will be more meaningful if the computed moduli is compared only with
the mean experimental value. The figure has been modified (please see pp 13) to include the mean inden-
tation modulus and its spread.
Comment C2.4
The number of fiber lamellae was mentioned in different sections of the manuscript. Page 4, line 6: 8-10
Lamellae, Page 7, line 58: 5-8 Lamellae, Page9, line27: 4-8 Lamellae. Please clarify the reason of this
difference and discuss the effect of number of Lamellae layers on the mechanical response of fibers.
Response R2.4
The number of lamellae varies due to number of reasons. It can be partly attributed to the position of
the vascular bundles, the location of the fibres within, and the maturity state of the fibres. Whereas the
fibre of 1 -year old bamboo can show number of lamellae as low as three, a fibre of 12 years bamboo has
about eight lamellae (Liese, 1998). Thus, the number of lamellae observed by different researchers depend
on the species, its age and, to some extent, the location of the fibres. In our samples, we have observed
fibres with 4-8 lamellae.
Overall, the deposition of additional lamellae results in increase in wall thickness which in turn in-
creases density in older culms. Mechanical properties of fibres depends on fibre diameter and cell wall
thickness. Hence, mature fibres with higher number of lamellae, are expected to show better mechanical
response than younger fibres. As explained by Liese (1998), the fibre wall thickness has profound effect
on compression strength parallel to grain, stress at proportional limit and modulus of elasticity.
Comment C2.5
I am wondering how many experimental results were used to determine the probabilities in figure 10.
Response R2.5
Inner and outer diameters of about 200 fibres were measured and recorded using an open source image
processing software ImageJ (National Institute of Health, USA). From the recorded data, corresponding
histograms were generated to plot the probability distribution shown in Figure 10.
Comment C2.6
Please use error-bar in experimental results of figure 14. I assume they are not only one experiment.
Response R2.6
Error bars to experimental results in Figure 14 have now been added in revised manuscript.
Other Issues:
Comment C2.7
In figure 10, di and do is used for fiber bundle. These exact same terms used for bamboo diameter in
figure 14. Please fix this.
Response R2.7
The terms Di and Do have now been used for bamboo diameter in Figure 14 in revised manuscript.
Comment C2.8.1
There are several typos in the manuscript. Page 9, Line 22
Response R2.8.1
The typo in line 22 (in earlier manuscript) on page 9 has now been corrected in revised manuscript.
Comment C2.8.2
Please be consistent in the formatting of numbering the equations throughout the text.
Response R2.8.2
The formatting of numbering the equations is now consistent.
Comment C2.8.3
Please fix the caption of figure 11, it does not make sense.
Response R2.8.3

Our response to comments by Reviewer 1
Comment C1.1
For the entire article, so many journal papers were introduced in Introduction part. I think that few cites
(e.g. Fig.6 and Fig.7) are redundant which are not related to your paper. However, for the development
of a simple phenomenological model to describe the mechanical stiffness, the authors may consider and
compared the advantages over a few developed models reported in other recent works (Habibi et al. Acta
biomaterialia 16, 178-186, 2015; Dixon and Gibson, J. R. Soc. Interface, 11(99), 2014).
Response R1.1
Figures 6 and 7 are not citations of other’s work but were prepared by immunolabelling the studied species
of bamboo in one of the collaborating laboratories (by JPK at the Univ Leeds). The immunolabelling
exercise is important for understanding the structure of the parenchyma and fibre cell walls completely. It
is especially useful in identifying the non-cellulosic polysaccharide components in the walls. In particular,
we have identified the presence of hemicellulosic polysaccharides such as glucuronoxylans and possibly
xyloglucans, which have helped to unravel the complete secondary cell wall structure. Though the overall
stiffness of the non-cellulosic amorphous structure surrounding the cellulose does not play a significant
part in determining the overall stiffness of the fibres, we believe that they have important role to play in
determining the overall strength.
We are aware of the works of Habibi et al. (2015) and Dixon and Gibson (2014). These papers were
brought to our notice after the manuscript was prepared. We agree with the reviewer that both of these
works are extremely relevant and have now discussed them extensively. A brief discussion has been added
in the Introduction (pp 1, paragraph 2, text in RED) while a detailed comparison between their and our
results now appear in Sec. 4.5 (pp. 14, paragraph 3, text in RED).

Comment C1.3
The specific formula of the probability density functions P1 and P2 should be shown. Furthermore, although
you consider the probability density in terms of di and do , you should point out that the specific probability
value to calculate the di and do shown in the Fig. 11(b).
Response R1.3
The probability density functions P1 (di ) and P2 (do ) are computed numerically by first measuring the
inner and outer diameters of about 200 randomly selected fibres from micrographs of the inner, middle
and outer sections of the thickness. The normalised probability distributions are generated numerically
(so that the areas under each of them is unity) and the probabilities are picked randomly from these
distributions while creating the synthetic bundles. The algorithm for choosing a random numbers x (with
a = x = b) such that they follow a given probability density p(x) is as follows (also see Fig. 7.3.2, Press
et al., 2007):
• Generate a trial value xtry such that xtry = a + (b - a)<U+03BE>1 , where <U+03BE>1 is uniform random number
between 0 and 1.
• Choose a function fx that has finite area and f (x) > p(x) for x = x = b.
• Determine p(xtry ) and f (xtry ) corresponding to xtry .
• Generate another uniform random number <U+03BE>2 between 0 and f (xtry ).
• Accept the trial value xtry only if <U+03BE>2 = p(xtry ).
The selection algorithm has been added in the manuscript on pp 10, text in RED.
