The authors analyze previously overlooked firefly monitoring data from a long-term research
station. They examine how firefly abundance and phenology change in response to habitat,
temperature, and precipitation. The key finding is the nonlinear relationship between
precipitation accumulation and degree day accumulation at the peak of firefly flight. Other
findings of interest include a cyclical trend in population abundance over time, changes in habitat
use over the monitoring season, and small differences in abundance between habitat types. The
entire analysis was shared via the R code provided online. It was well-commented and worked,
allowing me to replicate the analysis easily.
Major comments:
The quadratic effect of precipitation extremes on peak phenology appears to be due to an outlier
year in figure 7. I ran the analysis with different start dates for precipitation and degree day
accumulation, in order to see if alternatives make 2015 less of an outlier. Using start days of 1, 30,
75, and 90 removed the significant quadratic effect, showing that the key finding is sensitive to
this choice.
Thank you for sharing your analysis so I could explore your results! I think the link between
precipitation and the degree-day threshold warrants more analysis and an explanation of
potential mechanisms for the relationship in the discussion. My suggestions would include:
- Alternative explanations for degree-day variation: Winter temperature can modulate the
number of degree days required for development through “chilling” effects. If winter
temperatures are too warm, development is actually delayed. I was also curious of the proportion
of precipitation that was snow. Especially for fireflies underground, snow cover could provide a
buffer that could delay development. The Daymet gridded climate products (daymet.ornl.gov)
have estimates for snow cover if Kellogg doesn’t. I recommend Forrest & Thomson (2011) for a
study of winter chilling and snow cover effects on insect phenology.
- You could choose the start date for precipitation and degree day accumulation based on
optimizing model fit after a brute force search of all potential values. This approach of searching
for the best climate window is implemented in the climwin package (Bailey & van der Pol 2016).
- Or, you could discuss how 2015 is a weird year and the results are sensitive to this outlier.
Minor comments:
55-58: Ref. 25 by Faust & Weston has degree-day estimation for Photinus pyralis along with their
focal species. It’d be interesting if this were used for comparison with your results in the
discussion, although it’s from much further south.
93-95: Does the effect of precipitation in this study match with the nonlinear relationship you
propose? Would like to see this in discussion, too.
129: One issue I noticed with sampling is that start and end date varies from year-to-year by
several weeks. I don’t think this would change the modeled peak phenology much, but it would
3
be worth mentioning since it’s often a problem in phenology studies that rely on first
observations.
156: As explained above, the selection of start day changes the precipitation vs degree-day
threshold relationship.
161: 30C is a more typical temperate insect upper threshold. The weather data shows that this
isn’t uncommon at your site, although I doubt that the annual degree-day variation would
change much by including a degree-day model with this upper threshold.
197: Can the different abundance by habitat treatment be quantified statistically? In the
conclusion (284-287) this result is used to make recommendations for conservation management.
Before doing so, I would advise testing to see if the treatments are significantly different.
216: Model selection mentioned here should be explained in the methods section.
238-240: This cyclical pattern is really neat. Could possible explanations be parasites or large-scale
climate drivers like El Nino or NAO? This is strikingly different from many butterflies that show
jagged year-to-year peaks and troughs.
243-245: Your discussion of movement between habitats made me wonder about the spatial
arrangement of the sampling sites and treatments at Kellogg. A map could be useful to go with
the table of habitat treatment descriptions.
262: Ref. 42 cited here does not address multiple drivers making species more prone to
asynchrony. This assertion needs more support.
271-273: Ref. 25 breaks down firefly emergence by sex. Mating asynchrony could be really
important. See Calabrese et al. (2008).
284-287: As mentioned above, I would prefer this conservation recommendation to have more
statistical support.
Figure 5: This figure could be more informative by faceting by year and highlighting the modeled
phenology peak. It’d be easier to see how the GLM predictions match the peaks in the raw data
and could also shows the sampling variability in start and end date each year.

This is a nice use of long-term data. The manuscript should have been read by someone with
good editorial skills before it was submitted. It's a disservice to reviewers and to your
reputations as authors to submit a manuscript with so many editorial problems. I've made a lot
of corrections and suggestions on the PDF (Appendix A).
Why are results from this study already published in the 23 September issue of Science? Does that
preclude publication in this journal?
The appropriate literature is cited, the figures are relevant and appropriate, and the underlying
data are apparently publicly accessible (I didn't try to download them). I think the interpretation
of the data is good and the conclusions are sound.

3 18 Abstract
4
5
6 19 The timing of events in the life history of temperate insects is most typically primarily cued by one of
7
8
9 20 two drivers: photoperiod or temperature accumulation over the growing season. However, an insect’s
10
11 21 phenology can also be moderated by other drivers like rainfall or the phenology of its host plants. When
12
13 22 multiple drivers of phenology interact, there is greater potential for phenological asynchronies to arise
14
15
16 23 between an organism and those it interacts with. We examined the phenological patterns of a highly
17
18 24 seasonal group of insects, the Eastern Firefly (Photinus pyralis) over a 12-year period (2004–2015) across
19
20 25 10 plant communities to determine if interacting drivers could explain the variability observed in the
21
22
26 adult flight activity density (i.e. mating season) of this species. We found that temperature accumulation
23
24
25 27 was the primary driver of phenology with activity peaks usually occurring at a temperature accumulation
26
27 28 of ~800 degree days (base 10°C), however, our model found this peak varied by nearly 180 degree day
28
29 29 units between years. This variation could be explained by a quadratic relationship with the accumulation
30
31
32 30 of precipitation in the growing season; in years with either high and low precipitation extremes at our
33
34 31 study site, flight activity was delayed. More fireflies were captured in general in herbaceous plant
35
36 32 communities with minimal soil disturbance (alfalfa and no-till field crop rotations), but only weak
37
38
39 33 interactions occurred between within-season responses to climatic variables and plant community. The
40
41 34 interaction we observed between temperature and precipitation accumulation suggests that, although
42
43 35 climate warming has potential to disrupt phenology of many organisms, changes to regional
44
45
46
36 precipitation patterns can magnify these disruptions.

3 39 Introduction
4
5
6 40 Much can be learned about biological systems by observation alone [1], and observational data
7
8
9 41 are often captured incidentally as a result of human activity [2]. Incidental data can range from the very
10
11 42 informal and uncontrolled (e.g. comments on a topic in a web forum) to highly controlled and
12
13 43 meticulously collected (e.g. unused data from scientific experiments). Indeed, research activities can
14
15
16 44 produce systemic observational data of very high quality; for instance, insect trapping systems seldom
17
18 45 only capture target taxa. This 'by-catch' can provide data which supports investigations into entirely
19
20 46 uninvestigated phenomena. In this study we examine one such 'by-catch' data set: a 12-year time series
21
22
47 of firefly observations in southwestern Michigan for their responses to environmental and habitat
23
24
25 48 conditions.
26
27
28 49 Over 2,000 species of firefly (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) have been identified across various
29
30 50 temperate and tropical environments around the world [3]. As larvae, species within the family
31
32 51 Lampyridae spend much of their time living underground feeding on earthworms, mollusks, and other
33
34
35 52 subterranean invertebrates [4]. As adults, most species abstain from feeding [5], with the exception of
36
37 53 the species Photuris pennsylvanica, of which the female is a voracious predator of both con-specifics as
38
39 54 well as other insects [5–7]. Few studies been conducted on firefly conservation and broader-scale
40
41
42 55 ecology in relation to changing environments and land uses, and little is known about how
43
44 56 environmental parameters drive firefly life history. However, it has been demonstrated that the life
45
46 57 history of at least one species of firefly is temperature-dependent; researchers found that P.
47
48
58 pennsylvanica adult emergence could be artificially accelerated by exposing larvae to increased soil
49
50
51 59 temperature [8]. Much of the primary research on fireflies has focused on the bio-luminescent
52
53 60 properties of the firefly abdomen. These studies include, but are not limited to, the molecular/genetic

7
8
9 63 In addition to the scientific importance of the Lampyridae for their bio-luminescent properties
10
11 64 and as model organisms for evolutionary investigations, fireflies are also among the most widely
12
13
65 recognized and culturally valued insect families among non-scientists. Two US states have designated a
14
15
16 66 firefly as their “State Insect” [15]. Notably, fireflies also feature prominently in Japanese culture, where
17
18 67 they have been designated as national natural treasures in many districts and have been used to
19
20 68 generate support of biodiversity conservation efforts in Japanese agricultural regions [16–18]. They have
21
22
23 69 also been touted as useful classroom tools for sparking student interest in biology [19]. Because of their
24
25 70 popular appeal, it is unsurprising that public concern has grown about apparent declines of firefly
26
27 71 populations from regions around the world where they occur [20].
28
29
30 72 Considering the paucity of ecological information about fireflies, widespread popularity, ease at
31
32
33 73 which they are observed, and concerns about their population viability, fireflies represent an ideal
34
35 74 species for citizen science investigations. Citizen science efforts are currently underway seeking to gain
36
37 75 information about the status, geographic distribution, and phenology of fireflies [21–23] and peer-
38
39
76 reviewed publications on fireflies have already been produced based on these volunteer-generated data
40
41
42 77 [24,25]. The popularity of fireflies gives them great potential as a flagship and umbrella conservation
43
44 78 species and potentially an indicator species of ecological degradation in agricultural regions [26].
45
46 79 However, to our knowledge, no long term systematic study of firefly phenology and responses to
47
48
49 80 environmental drivers has been published.
50
51
52 81 Phenology plays a significant role in regulating species abundance, distribution, and biodiversity
53
54 82 [27,28]. The timing of phenological events in insect life histories is strongly linked to climatic conditions
55
56 83 [29–31] such as temperature and precipitation [27,32,33]. Changes in phenological timing can have

1
2
3 84 community-wide consequences, and differential responses among various species within a community
4
5
6 85 can lead to trophic mismatches [28,30]. For example, the timing of larval winter moth (Operophtera
7
8 86 brumata) emergence was formerly largely synchronized with oak (Quercus robur) bud burst. Caterpillars
9
10 87 that emerge too early lack a sufficient food source and will starve, while caterpillars that emerge too
11
12
13 88 late will be exposed to older, poor quality leaves, leading to negative physiological implications [34].
14
15 89 Increased spring temperature has resulted in changes in the timing of oak bud burst. However, the
16
17 90 winter moth has yet to adapt to changing temperatures, which has led to disrupted synchrony between
18
19
20
91 these two species [34]. Thus, phenological shifts can have both top-down and bottom-up consequences
21
22 92 extending throughout multiple trophic levels. Long term observations are important for understanding
23
24 93 ecological trends and the merit of phenology as a predictor of ecological consequences. A long term
25
26
94 study on the Genji firefly (Luciola cruciate) in Japan found that populations fluctuated in response to
27
28
29 95 rainfall, potentially leading to early larval emergence and reduced foraging [35]. However, the ways in
30
31 96 which climate change and other environmental events have impacted firefly species is less understood.
32
33
34 97 Developing a model for the emergence of adult fireflies is key to developing our understanding
35
36 98 of firefly phenology, which can then be used to expand firefly conservation efforts, educational
37
38
39 99 outreach, environmental research, and to predict peak firefly display. In this study, we examine a ‘by-
40
41 100 catch’ dataset documenting captures of fireflies at the Kellogg Biological Station over a 12-year period
42
43 101 and place it in the context of other available data to gain insights into the long-term dynamics and
44
45
46
102 phenology of this charismatic, but understudied taxon.

3 106 Data were obtained through two publicly available data sets—a weather data set which
4
5
6 107 included daily maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation, as well as a data set that focuses
7
8 108 on ladybeetle observations, but also documents captures of the other insect species. Both data sets
9
10 109 arise from Michigan State University's Kellogg Biological Stations (KBS), located in southwestern
11
12
13 110 Michigan. The firefly abundance data were collected as a part of the KBS Long Term Ecological Research
14
15 111 (LTER) site within the Main Cropping System Experiment (MCSE) and forest sites starting in 2004.
16
17 112 Fireflies were recorded to family alone, however, from spot-checks of the collected data, it appears the
18
19
20
113 majority of fireflies collected belonged to the species Photinus pyralis, the common eastern firefly.
21
22
114 Within the MCSE, seven plant community treatments were established in 1989 ranging from a
23
24
25 115 three-year rotation of annual field crops (maize, soybean, wheat) under four levels of management
26
27 116 intensity (conventional, no-till, reduced input, or biologically based) to perennial crops including alfalfa,
28
29 117 poplar and early successional vegetation (i.e. abandoned agricultural fields maintained in an early
30
31
32 118 successional state by yearly burnings; Table 1). Each of these treatments is replicated six times across
33
34 119 the MCSE site with each replicate consisting of a 1 ha sized plot. We also included three forest sites in
35
36 120 our analysis, these sites were established in 1993 within 3 km of the MCSE site on KBS and represent
37
38
39 121 one of three plant community treatments: conifer forest plantations; late successional deciduous forest;
40
41 122 and successional forest arising on abandoned agricultural land (Table 1). Forested treatment plots are
42
43 123 also 1 ha in size but are replicated three times for each treatment.
44
45
46 124 Observations were taken on a weekly basis throughout the sampling season at five sampling
47
48
125 stations within each replicate (both MCSE and forest sites). These insect abundance data are available
49
50
51 126 publicly, online at http://lter.kbs.msu.edu/datatables/67. Insect abundance monitoring was done using
52
53 127 un-baited two-sided yellow cardboard sticky cards (Pherocon, Zoecon, Palo Alto, CA) suspended from a
54
55 128 metal post within each sampling station 1.2m above the ground. Cards were deployed each week for a
56
57
58 129 one-week exposure for the duration of the growing season (14 ± 1 weeks, on average, per year).

15
16 135 Analyses presented in this manuscript were run in R 3.3.1 “Bug in Your Hair” (R Development Core Team
17
18
19 136 2016). Firefly data were extracted from the database held at the KBS data archive and combined with
20
21 137 relevant agronomic data (which are encoded in plot and treatment numbers in the main database) and
22
23 138 are hosted at figshare at https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3686040.
24
25
26 139 Data were subject to quality control manipulations to remove misspellings in variable names
27
28
140 which had occurred with data entry. Observations with missing values for firefly counts were excluded
29
30
31 141 from analysis. Because subsample data was zero-biased, we used reshape2 [36] to sum within date,
32
33 142 within plot numbers of captures, and created an additional variable to account for sampling effort
34
35 143 (which was usually consistent at five traps per plot per sampling period, but on occasion traps were lost
36
37
38 144 or damaged).
39
40
41 145 Weather data (daily maximum and minimum temperatures were reported in °C and daily
42
43 146 precipitation in mm) were downloaded directly from the Kellogg Biological Station Data archive
44
45 147 (http://lter.kbs.msu.edu/datatables/7.csv). To overcome errors in calculations requiring accumulated
46
47
48 148 annual weather data caused by rare missing data points (most often occurring during winter, in periods
49
50 149 of extreme cold leading to equipment malfunction), we created a function to replace missing values in
51
52 150 the temperature data with the value that was observed for that variable from the day before the
53
54
151 missing observation.

3 152 We created a dummy variable for ‘start day’ to enable the user to easily test the sensitivity of
4
5
6 153 our conclusions to varying our within-year start of accumulation of environmental conditions. We
7
8 154 empirically determined that March 1 (start = 60) provided the best compromise between capturing early
9
10 155 growing season weather variation and negating brief variation in winter conditions, however, the
11
12
13 156 selection of the precise day did not dramatically influence the overall trends in the results.
14
15
16 157 We then created a function to calculate daily degree day accumulation and season-long degree
17
18 158 day accumulation based on Allen’s [37] double sine function, using our daily maximum and minimum
19
20 159 temperature data. We created a dummy variable for our minimum development threshold to facilitate
21
22
160 sensitivity analysis, but set it to a default value of 10°C. We did not use a maximum development
23
24
25 161 threshold in our calculation, assuming temperatures exceeding its hypothetical value (often >35°C for
26
27 162 temperate insects) were rare. Accumulations were calculated from the start day variable, as described
28
29 163 above. We also created functions that calculated the accumulation of precipitation over the sampling
30
31
32 164 week, the accumulation of precipitation over the growing season, from the start date, and the number
33
34 165 of rainy days in a sampling period. Weather data were merged with firefly data to facilitate subsequent
35
36 166 analyses.

41
42 168 We used ggplot2 [38] to visualize trends in captures of fireflies by plant community treatment

45 169 over years. We then conducted a multivariate analysis to determine if firefly plant community use
46
47 170 patterns changed within or between years, and what environmental factors were associated with plant
48
49 171 community use patterns. To accomplish this, data were cast as a date-by-treatment matrix at two
50
51
172 resolutions (weekly observations and yearly observations), transformed using the Wisconsin
52
53
54 173 standardization, and Bray-Curtis differences were subjected to non-metric multi-dimensional scaling

4
5
6 175 patterns were influenced by weather.
7
8
9 176 To examine patterns in firefly captures over time, and the interactions of these captures with
10
11 177 environmental variables, we visualized trends in capture data by sampling week and degree day
12
13 178 accumulation. Noting that degree day accumulation was associated with the clearest patterns in firefly
14
15
16 179 captures (see results), with some variation due to plant community, we built a generalized linear model
17
18 180 with a negative binomial structure to explain these patterns. The model included the degree day
19
20 181 accumulation in linear and quadratic forms as continuous variables, year and plant community
21
22
182 treatment as factors, and trapping effort as an offset variable (to account for lost or compromised
23
24
25 183 traps). After fitting the model, we used the resultant regression parameters to generate predicted
26
27 184 values, so we could visually compare the performance of the model to the raw data.
28
29
30 185 Because the model found year-to-year variation in the activity peak that was not explained by
31
32 186 degree day accumulation, we extracted the activity peaks from each year as predicted by the model to a
33
34
35 187 new data frame, and matched these data to other relevant environmental variables in the weather
36
37 188 matrix (week the peak occurred in, precipitation variables corresponding to that week). We visualized
38
39 189 the relationship between activity peak and other variables, and then constructed a generalized linear
40
41
42 190 model for a quadratic relationship between the activity peak, by degree days, and the precipitation
43
44 191 accumulation at the activity peak.
45
46
47 192 For all frequentist analyses, a significance level of a = 0.05 was used.

3 195 Visualizations of firefly capture data by treatment and time period revealed several patterns.
4
5
6 196 Numbers of fireflies captured in each trap varied by plant community type and across samples (Figure
7
8 197 1), but in general, more fireflies were captured in alfalfa and no-till row crop treatments. Average
9
10 198 numbers of fireflies captured per trap also demonstrated variation by year independent of plant
11
12
13 199 community treatment. Overlaid plots of average captures for all treatments against year (Figure 2)
14
15 200 suggest a 6–7 year firefly population cycle that appears uncorrelated with environmental variables.
16
17
18 201 Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling revealed only weak trends in patterns of capture between
19
20 202 plant community treatments at both the yearly and weekly resolutions. At the yearly resolution (Figure
21
22
203 3A), plant community treatment use varied slightly with the number of rainy days in the growing season
23
24
25 204 (R2 = 0.16, p = 0.006, 2-D NMDS stress = 0.14) with herbaceous habitat use generally associated with
26
27 205 greater amounts of rainfall. At the weekly resolution (Figure 3B), 2D-NMDS stress was higher (0.19), but
28
29 206 a general trend away from forest plots was observed with increasing degree day accumulation (R2 =
30
31
32 207 0.15, p = 0.001) and week (R2 = 0.15, p = 0.001).
33
34
35 208 When plotting firefly abundance by week of capture, the timing of the peaks in firefly
36
37 209 emergence show asynchrony among years (Figure 4A), indicating that week of year (and, by proxy, day
38
39 210 length) is not a strong driver of firefly emergence. However, plotting firefly numbers instead against
40
41
42 211 degree day accumulation dramatically reduced the asynchrony of emergence peaks (Figure 4B). Thus,
43
44 212 degree day accumulation appears to be a better predictor of firefly populations than week of year or
45
46 213 associated variables.
47
48
49 214 Our model for firefly activity incorporating degree day accumulation, crop, and year, performed
50
51
215 well at predicting the timing of the activity peaks (Figure 5), accounting for more than 40 percent of the
52
53
54 216 variation in the raw data. However, model selection favored the inclusion of a year term as a factor,
55
56 217 suggesting that another factor in addition to degree day accumulation was varying from year to year,

3 218 and impacting firefly activity. Activity peaks varied from year to year by nearly 180 degree-day units,
4
5
6 219 varying from 720 ± 38 DD in 2004 to 898 ± 55 DD in 2012 (Figure 6). However, we found the year-to-year
7
8 220 variation was well-explained by precipitation accumulation: a quadratic relationship occurs between
9
10 221 degree day at peak emergence and precipitation accumulation (pseudo-R2 = 0.456, p = 0.026; Figure 7).

16 223 Discussion
17
18
19 224 The greatest proportion of fireflies were captured in alfalfa and no-till plant communities (Figure
20
21
22 225 1), indicating that areas with moderate soil disturbance and primarily herbaceous plant communities
23
24 226 favored firefly emergence. This result was unexpected; because fireflies spend much of their life cycle in
25
26 227 the soil, it may be expected that plots with little soil disturbance (coniferous, deciduous and successional
27
28
228 forests) would foster the greatest populations of fireflies. However, these plots produced capture rates
29
30
31 229 similar to those observed in the intensively managed and tilled conventional row crop plots. Our result
32
33 230 contrasted with observations of another genus of fireflies in Malaysia (Pteroptyx), where researchers
34
35 231 found that plant canopy structure was the most important determinant of abundance [40]. Also
36
37
38 232 surprising was the relatively low capture rate in early successional plots, which are primarily herbaceous,
39
40 233 with no tillage regime. Thus, the yearly burnings may play a role in suppressing firefly populations in
41
42 234 these plots. An alternative explanation for these variations in captures could be differences in trapping
43
44
45 235 efficiencies between plant communities. However, if this were the case, we would expect trapping
46
47 236 efficiencies in the three other row crop treatments (conventional, organic and reduced input
48
49 237 management) not to differ appreciably from that of the no-till row crop plant community.
50
51
52 238 When plotted over sample years (Figure 2), captures of fireflies by treatment seem to suggest an
53
54
239 intriguing cyclical dynamic, with alternating peaks and troughs in captures on an approximately 6-year
55
56
57 240 cycle. Our time series only spans 12 years, meaning more data will be required to elucidate this pattern

3 241 and its drivers. Similarly, analysis of plant community use patterns was inconclusive (Figure 3). At the
4
5
6 242 weekly resolution there was a trend away from woody treatments over the growing season (Figure 3B;
7
8 243 i.e. with both increasing week and increasing degree day accumulation). Although this pattern was not
9
10 244 strong, it could result from fireflies overwintering in forest habitats and then moving to lower-canopy
11
12
13 245 herbaceous habitats for mating displays. We observed very similar performance of both degree day and
14
15 246 week, likely due to autocorrelation between the two variables that cannot be resolved at the sampling
16
17 247 resolution used over the course of the study.
18
19
20 248 Although both photoperiod and degree day accumulation can both play a role in the phenology
21
22
249 of insects, our results suggest that degree day accumulation is the dominant driver of firefly flight
23
24
25 250 activity. The model was unable to account for between trap variation within a single sampling day
26
27 251 (Figure 5), though it was able to capture the overall trends in activity quite well, using only degree day
28
29 252 accumulation, plant community treatment, and year as predictors. Nevertheless, degree day
30
31
32 253 accumulation was not the sole driver in within season variability. Our model found year-to-year
33
34 254 variability in activity peaks that could not be explained by degree day accumulation alone. We found
35
36 255 that this variation in activity peak by degree day accumulation had a quadratic relationship with
37
38
39 256 precipitation, indicating that both drought and heavy rainfall in the time period leading up to their
40
41 257 activity peak can delay the peak (Figure 7). Assuming a ~20°C daily average temperature at this site in
42
43 258 late June and early July, this could translate to a ten-or-more day change in activity peak due to
44
45
46
259 precipitation extremes in any given year.
47
48
260 In this study, we have clearly demonstrated a species whose phenology varies in response to
49
50
51 261 multiple drivers. Species with phenologic responses to multiple drivers are not rare [41]. Yet ecological
52
53 262 interactions among species with multiple drivers of phenology may be prone to asynchrony [42],
54
55 263 potentially leading to dire consequences in a changing environment [43]. Our study examined the
56
57
58 264 phenological responses to environmental conditions of adult fireflies; however, data on larvae or sex of
59
60 12
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 13 of 33 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 265 the adults was unavailable. Adult Photinus fireflies are non-feeding [14], so shifts in their activity are
4
5
6 266 unlikely to have direct consequences on herbivores through phenological asynchronies. Shifts in adult
7
8 267 activity likely correspond to shifts in development or activity among larvae, potentially leading to
9
10 268 asynchronies between larvae-prey populations at this critical development time period. Resources
11
12
13 269 acquired during the predaceous larval stage are important in determining mating success among adult
14
15 270 fireflies: males provide an energetically costly nuptial gift to the female in the form of a spermatophore
16
17 271 [44]. If sex differences in phenological responses to environmental conditions exist, asynchronies
18
19
20
272 between males and females may additionally reduce mating success and fecundity, thus this should be
21
22 273 an area of emphasis in future study. Additionally, phenological shifts in fireflies may lead to
23
24 274 consequences at other trophic levels. For example, generalist ground dwelling predators like firefly
25
26
275 larvae and other predaceous beetles are known to have dramatic effects on the establishment of
27
28
29 276 agricultural pests early in the growing season [45]. Similarly, although distasteful and avoided by many
30
31 277 predators, some birds, lizards and frogs are known to feed on adult fireflies [46], thus shifts in firefly
32
33 278 activity may have dietary consequences for animals at higher trophic levels.

39 280 Conclusions
40
41
42 281 Fireflies are a charismatic and important taxon with ties to trophic function, economic
43
44
45 282 importance, and culture. Although empirical evidence of specific declines of Photinus fireflies has not
46
47 283 been clearly demonstrated in longitudinal studies, naturalists and citizen scientists perceive a decline in
48
49 284 their number [21], leading to interest in their conservation. Our study has offered new insight to support
50
51
285 conservation efforts and to direct future research. Photinus pyralis appears to thrive in habitats with
52
53
54 286 moderate soil disturbance. Thus, efforts to foster no-till and perennial agricultural systems [47,48] will
55
56 287 likely benefit the species. Climate warming may advance the activity of fireflies to earlier and earlier in

3 288 the growing season, but other extremes of climate in the form of precipitation may introduce
4
5
6 289 unpredictable elements to this, and add the possibility of inducing asynchrony with other systems.
7
8
9 290 The availability of long term observational data, made freely accessible to the public, was an
10
11 291 essential factor in the discoveries made in this study. Although the study that provided these data were
12
13 292 not initiated with this purpose in mind, we were able to empirically demonstrate and disentangle the
14
15
16 293 effect of multiple drivers on firefly phenology simply because we had the statistical power to do so.
17
18 294 Although species that respond to multiple, interacting environmental drivers are relatively common,
19
20 295 data supporting investigations of this kind are rare [49]. We therefore encourage all practicing ecologists

mments to the Author(s)
authors analyze previously overlooked firefly monitoring data from a long-term research station. They
mine how firefly abundance and phenology change in response to habitat, temperature, and
cipitation. The key finding is the nonlinear relationship between precipitation accumulation and degree
accumulation at the peak of firefly flight. Other findings of interest include a cyclical trend in
ulation abundance over time, changes in habitat use over the monitoring season, and small
erences in abundance between habitat types. The entire analysis was shared via the R code provided
ne. It was well-commented and worked, allowing me to replicate the analysis easily.
ank you so much for your comments. We are glad you found our documentation sufficient to make
work reproducible, as this is important to us. Furthermore, your comments have offered us additional
ght and will improve the quality of our manuscript.
or comments:
quadratic effect of precipitation extremes on peak phenology appears to be due to an outlier year in
re 7. I ran the analysis with different start dates for precipitation and degree day accumulation, in
er to see if alternatives make 2015 less of an outlier. Using start days of 1, 30, 75, and 90 removed the
ificant quadratic effect, showing that the key finding is sensitive to this choice.
s is a great insight. We selected this ‘start date’ for a few reasons- first, because it was used as the
t date in the Faust and Weston Paper (ref 25)- so we essentially used this as our ‘best guess’ for start
e. Secondly, it was based on our experience with seasonal weather in Michigan- there is often a week
wo of warm temperatures in January or February, followed by a hard frost, and additional snow- our
king was to minimize the effect of these fluctuations, so they wouldn’t count towards the accumulation
egree days; and thirdly, because it minimized the AIC when running the degree day GLM. However,
agree- to not consider alternate explanations would be an oversight. We have added your suggestions
he discussion, as described below
nk you for sharing your analysis so I could explore your results! I think the link between precipitation
the degree-day threshold warrants more analysis and an explanation of potential mechanisms for the
tionship in the discussion. My suggestions would include:
Alternative explanations for degree-day variation: Winter temperature can modulate the number of
ree days required for development through “chilling” effects. If winter temperatures are too warm,
elopment is actually delayed. I was also curious of the proportion of precipitation that was snow.
ecially for fireflies underground, snow cover could provide a buffer that could delay development. The
met gridded climate products (daymet.ornl.gov) have estimates for snow cover if Kellogg doesn’t. I
ommend Forrest & Thomson (2011) for a study of winter chilling and snow cover effects on insect
nology.
You could choose the start date for precipitation and degree day accumulation based on optimizing
del fit after a brute force search of all potential values. This approach of searching for the best climate
dow is implemented in the climwin package (Bailey & van der Pol 2016).
Or, you could discuss how 2015 is a weird year and the results are sensitive to this outlier.
have now included a section discussing aspects of all three of these suggestions on lines 272-293.
or comments:
58: Ref. 25 by Faust & Weston has degree-day estimation for Photinus pyralis along with their focal
cies. It’d be interesting if this were used for comparison with your results in the discussion, although
rom much further south.
s study focusses on P. carolinus, but its similar results are intriguing. We have now added a paragraph
cifically comparing our study to theirs in the discussion on lines 253-260
95: Does the effect of precipitation in this study match with the nonlinear relationship you propose?
uld like to see this in discussion, too.
s study used a simple correlation analysis, and it found a negative effect between rainfall and firefly
ndance- ie they did not investigate the possibility of a curvilinear relationship. However, this is an
ortant result, and we have added discussion of it on lines 279-283.
: One issue I noticed with sampling is that start and end date varies from year-to-year by several
ks. I don’t think this would change the modeled peak phenology much, but it would be worth
ntioning since it’s often a problem in phenology studies that rely on first observations.

: As explained above, the selection of start day changes the precipitation vs degree-day threshold

ed caveats of this assumption to the discussion. L 154-159
: 30C is a more typical temperate insect upper threshold. The weather data shows that this isn’t
ommon at your site, although I doubt that the annual degree-day variation would change much by
uding a degree-day model with this upper threshold.
agree that this would not likely change the outcome of our analysis appreciably, but hesitate to build
ther assumption into the model (ie taking a guess at an upper thermal threshold) because of this.
: Can the different abundance by habitat treatment be quantified statistically? In the conclusion (284-
) this result is used to make recommendations for conservation management. Before doing so, I
ld advise testing to see if the treatments are significantly different.

nuscript.
