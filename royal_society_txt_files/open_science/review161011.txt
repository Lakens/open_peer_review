Review of Ghirlanda et al "Memory for stimulus sequences"
submitted to Royal Society Open Science
This nice, brief paper introduces a new model of working memory in animals, and shows that it
can well fit the results of some learning experiments from multiple species of vertebrate. The
authors suggest that memory for sequential order is very limited in nonhuman species, as
opposed to humans, and that this represents an important (indeed fundamental) cognitive
difference between us and other animals.
The paper is elegant and succinct, and the main model is very simple, and seems both intuitively
plausible and to fit the animal data well. The more complex model, as the authors admit, is a "toy
model" that I don't think would be at all plausible for capturing how humans remember items in
sequential order; I do not however see this as a major problem since the focus of the ms. is on the
simpler model. On the other hand I think that a paper making claims about the specialities of
human working memory should make a better attempt to characterize this specialization, at least
by referring to other hypotheses and approaches in the literature.
My main difficulty with the ms. as it stands is that it makes too little contact with the rather large
related literature, in some cases to papers that make rather similar arguments to the authors'. I
think that this would need to be remedied before publication, and make detailed suggestions
below. Thus I suggest a "revise and resubmit" decision.
Detailed comments:
1. There is a large literature on human sequence learning, some of it computationally
sophisticated, that should be referenced and discussed (by my reading this community has
reached a similar conclusion to that of the current authors, though it is a rather contentious
literature). This goes back in some way to Miller's famous "magical number seven" paper [1], in
that this is all about CHUNKING of sequences as a way of somehow exceeding working memory
limits by grouping items together. That is, although working memory always has the same item
limit, we can exceed this limit by grouping items together and storing them as a "chunk" in a
single memory slot. If this is true then it may be that humans don't really do full sequence
learning but rather can divide up sequences into chunks including just precedence and recency
information. See e.g. [2, 3]
This idea seems quite relevant to the authors' point, especially given that some of their examples
(e.g. for mathematics in Table 1) are in fact about grouping NOT sequencing as stated. The reason
(3x5)-2 <U+2260> 3 x (5-2) concerns the grouping of operations, not the order in which these groups are
executed. Similar arguments are often made by linguists for syntax. So I think this aspect of the
argument deserves a bit more care, and thoughtful discussion.
A recent introduction to this literature would be Julia Udden's work on what she calls "structured
sequence processing" [4, 5] and which integrates this into the larger literature on computational
theory (formal language theory etc). This literature (a good review is [6]) provides a quite
specific and well-formalized statement of the kinds of differences in working memory that the
authors may be hinting at in the current paper: the distinction between some finite state
subregular processing (e.g. in terms of bigrams) vs. supra-regular processing. A specific
hypothesis about the difference between humans and animals in this respect is given by [7] - that
only humans are capable of acquiring supra-regular systems, and might be a good place to start
in a discussion of the wider literature. But overall, this literature reaches a similar conclusion to
the authors, from a rather different direction.
3
In contrast, the other body of research deserving discussion is the serial reaction time task which
offers a way to test sequence learning implicitly, which has been used a lot in humans e.g. [8, 9].
There is also some animal literature [10] that seems to support similarities in sequence learning in
rats and humans. Similarly there is recent primate data that seems to show similar sequence
learning in monkeys, chimpanzees and humans: [11-13]. So the authors should either contest this
claim, or show how it is compatible with their own because different aspects of memory are
tested in the different paradigms considered.
2. Are all "humans" capable of sequential ordering? Two groups are of obvious interest: preverbal
infants, and non-literate adults. There has been a fair amount of work on number and sequence
cognition in both groups (some of it overlapping with that suggested above) that should be
referred to.
One paper is particularly interesting, because it found similar, and to me very surprising,
limitations in the sequential learning both of birds acquiring song, and infants acquiring speech:
Lipkind, D., … Tchernichovski, O. (2013). Stepwise acquisition of vocal combinatorial capacity in
songbirds and human infants. Nature, 498, 104-108.
This at least suggests that preverbal infants do NOT have the same sequential abilities as adults.
Minor points:
1. I don't understand the sentence line 41-43 on pg 4. Please clarify.
2. Research ethics: this statement a) is grammatically inconsistent; b) is not really true (the authors
report data from both humans and animals!) so a more appropriate statement is needed.
3. Data, although a private link to the data is given, the data are there and they are clearly laid out
But it is not clear how this will be distributed if the paper is accepted (e.g. via Dryad or
equivalent).

The manuscript is looking into data about sequence discrimination in various species and
compares them to human performance. It offers a model, referred to as “the trace model” to
explain the difference in performance.
This is an interesting topic and the trace model is an attractive way of interpreting empirical
findings. I think it is an important contribution. The manuscript has some issues though, that I
believe should be addressed. The crucial point is the comparison to human performance.
1. Comparing speeds in sequence discrimination learning between humans and other animals has
its issues. Even when the stimuli used are not too human-centric, humans will always have the
benefit of having the test verbally explained to them, which may facilitate faster learning. But
perhaps this can be controlled for. Another, much more fundamental advantage humans have
due to language is its benefits for memory. Language can be used to code the sequence in
memory, and allows “chunking” of information that can augment working memory. So while the
authors are interested in the learning of arbitrary information, they might be overlooking the fact
that humans are better equipped for dealing with arbitrary information. One way to test this
would be to look at studies in infants, who do not have language skills yet. How are they
performing in comparison, and can their performance be explained by the trace model? This is a
crucial point in my opinion, if the argument for the superiority of humans in that domain is to be
framed the way it currently is. I would clarify the possible role of language in human sequence
5
learning: the coding of sequential information is important for language acquisition, but the
acquisition of language also improves coding of sequential information.
2. While there is no doubt that humans cognitive abilities are much more complex than other
animals, I am concerned about the hypothesis that nonhumans “… lack a general-purpose
memory that can accurately encode sequential information.” What is a general purpose memory?
This is rather vague. Do humans really have such a thing? The results seem to support a
hypothesis that other animals coding of information in memory is of lower resolution/lesser
nuance compared to humans.
3. Continuing the point regarding language, but from the perspective of imitation of action
sequences: there are some recent studies in social learning pointing to the importance of language
in learning action sequence:
- Morgan, T.J.H, et al., 2015. Experimental evidence for the co-evolution of hominin tool-making
teaching and language. Nature Communications 6, 6029.
- Dean, L.G., et al., 2012. Identification of the social and cognitive processes underlying human
cumulative culture. Science 335(6072), pp. 1114-1118.
4. There are actually several models analyzing different modes of encoding information, in an
attempt to explain cognitive differences. Here are a few that I am familiar with:
- Arbilly, Motro, Feldman and Lotem, 2010. Co-evolution of learning complexity and social
foraging strategies. Journal of Theoretical Biology 267(4), 573-581.
- Kolodny, Edelman and Lotem, 2012. The evolution of continuous learning of the structure of the
environment. Journal of the Royal Society Interface 11(92), 2013091.
- Kolodny, Edelman and Lotem, 2015. Evolution of protolinguistic abilities as a by-product of
learning to forage in structured environments. Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological
Sciences 282(1811), 20150353.
The last two in particular focus on learning of sequences of stimuli. Their perspective is different,
but is highly related.
5. There seems to be missing information in figure 3b and 3d (it does not show anything but an
axis with tick marks in the pdf, and I could not find another version for it).
6. Part 2 could use a reshuffle and additions: making clear from the start what kind of
experiments are included in the analysis, why they are comparable, what kind of stimuli are they
using. I understand the format is very short, but these are the obvious questions that come up
when reading.
7. Table 1 lists abilities and provides examples of how sequential information is relevant. But a lot
of these examples are not mutually exclusive and this creates a confusion. Episodic memory
stands on its own, but it is obviously involved in some of the other abilities listed. The example
given for the role of sequential information in Theory of Mind is unclear: how is it different from
episodic memory? I agree that sequence is important for ToM, but not sure we can argue this is a
special attribute within ToM. Causal learning might be involved in planning, imitation,
cooperation … I very much appreciate the authors wanting to give examples for the importance
of sequential information in different processes, but perhaps it will be better served by a succinct
paragraph in the text.

of sequential information in different processes, but perhaps it will be better served by a succinct
paragraph in the text.

The authors have made changes in response to most of my comments. However, I still disagree
with their interpretation of the results, specifically that the data "corroborates the hypothesis that
nonhuman working memory lacks the ability to faithfully encode sequential information for
arbitrary stimuli, i.e., stimuli for which no specific adaptation exists." (first paragraph of the
discussion). The model very nicely fits the data, which is a great result, and what that means is

that accurate encoding of stimuli sequences may depend on how far apart they are from each
other in the memory space. I am not convinced that this model shows that improved coding of
sequential information is a key cognitive element setting us apart from other animals, especially
since there is no data from pre-verbal humans, or from apes.
Not unrelated, I also believe that it is necessary to discuss Kolodny et al.'s papers. They are
approaching a similar question using different tools, and offer a different insight, suggesting a
trajectory in which learning abilities adapted to foraging situations evolve into language learning
abilities.
Finally, I can still only find tick marks in figure 3b and 3d, and now I am also missing the text in

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-161011.R1)
Dear Editor,
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to further revise our paper. We are happy that Reviewer
2 has no further objections about our empirical and computational results. Regarding her two
remaining points, we have modified our manuscript as detailed in the enclosed “Reply to
reviewers” document. In brief, we have stated explicitly that, in agreement with the Reviewer, we
are proposing a hypothesis about differences between humans and other species, and not a
proven result. The relevant modifications are in the first part of the Discussion. We believe there
is enough evidence to entertain this hypothesis seriously, and we agree with the Reviewer that
more work is needed to evaluate it, as we discuss in the second and third paragraphs of the
Discussion.
The Reviewer would also like us to discuss papers by Kolodny and others on language evolution.
We would like to have your advice here. We have thought a great deal about these papers (also
when preparing our previous revision), but we remain unsure about the value of discussing
them. These papers do consider sequential abilities as pre-requisites for language, but this point
is not directly related to our paper, in which language only plays the role of an example of how
human cognition involves sequential abilities. We feel that if we were to discuss Kolodny's
papers we would also have to discuss dozens of ideas about language evolution and sequential
structure (some are mentioned in our “Reply” document). This discussion would be either
extremely generic or very lengthy, and in any case peripheral to the main points of our paper. I
hope you can understand our reluctance to discuss these papers, but please do advise us if you
think that a useful discussion of these papers is possible.

Appendix A
Reply to Reviewer 1
We thank Reviewer 1 for a thoughtful assessment of our manuscript. The Reviewer makes two major
points:
1. We should try to characterize better how human memory differs from animal memory
2. We do not make enough contact with existing literature
Point 1. We agree that it would be highly desirable to provide a better characterization of how human
memory mechanisms differ from those of other species. Unfortunately, this is a difficult task. Our
approach has been to first identify differences that are apparent in behavior, such as the difficulties and
systematic errors we report in our manuscript. Work about memory mechanisms can then follow. By
leveraging previous work on memory traces, we have been able to propose a model of how animals
solve sequence discriminations. We do not know, however, how humans overcome the shortcomings
apparent in animal memory. Thousands of researchers work actively on this problem, and indeed it
seems unlikely that the workings of human memory can be captured by a single strategy such as the
one we propose as accounting, to a large extent, for nonhuman performance. We think it is fair to leave
the question to future research. We have added material to the Discussion with these and other
considerations. In addition, we have removed the claim that our “toy model” represent aspects of
human memory. It now serves as illustration of what a memory with a faithful representation of order
might behave.
Point 2. We are grateful to the Reviewer for bringing to our attention many important studies and for
compiling an essential reference list. We have reviewed these suggestions carefully. Here are our
comments, some of which have been inserted in the revised manuscript. The comments are organized
based on the reference list provided by the Reviewer:
1. Miller G.A. 1956 The magical number seven plus or minus two: Some limits on our capacity for
processing information. Psych Rev 63, 81-97.
2. Endress A.D., Carden S., Versace E., Hauser M.D. 2010 The apes’ edge: positional learning in
chimpanzees and humans Anim Cog 13(3), 483-495.
3. Endress A.D., Nespor M., Mehler J. 2009 Perceptual and memory constraints on language acquisition.
Trends Cog Sci 13(8), 348-353.
These references, and the Reviewer comments, point out to the importance of “chunking” as a memory
strategy to overcome limitations of capacity. They also mention other strategies, such as using sequence
start and end as “marker” points to aid processing. In addition to the references provided, chunking in
animal memory has been researched by Herbert Terrace and others. As the Reviewer observes, the topic
of which strategies may be employed by animals is somewhat contentious. In any case, the data we
report show clear performance deficits. Even if animals can chunk or use other memory strategies, these
did not help in the reviewed studies. Note also that it may be possible to reinterpret findings that have
been considered as evidence of chunking using a trace memory. We show, for example, that a number
of “grammar learning” results are satisfactorily accounted for by a trace model. We feel that devoting
space to the issue of alternative memory strategies would distract from our two main points: the
empirical findings that sequence discriminations are hard to learn, and the theoretical proposal of a trace
model for nonhuman sequence memory. We have, however, mentioned in the Discussion that the trace
model provides a baseline model against which to evaluate more complex memory strategies, such as
chunking. We have also added references to grammar learning and prospective models of learning.

We thank the Reviewer for pointing us to this very interesting literature. Related to the point above
about chunking, we do not disagree that there are other unique aspects of human information
processing. The abilities underling grammar acquisition, for example, are fascinating and a likely point of
departure between humans and other animals. The existence of these other differences, however, does
not invalidate the fact that data show a widespread deficit in sequence processing among nonhuman
animals, which can be accounted for, to a large degree, by a trace memory model. We have clarified our
position on the relationship between language and serial memory in the Discussion.
Our example in Table 1 is not meant to argue that there is no hierarchical or grouping structure in
mathematics. We simply attempted to illustrate, in a simple case, that the order in which operations are
executed is important for mathematics. To clarify this point, we have removed the hierarchical structure
in the example and simply pointed out the difference between 5-3 and 3-5, which is purely a matter of
serial order.

We thank the Reviewer for providing these references, which touch upon several issues and allow us to
clarify our thinking and presentation in the manuscript. References 8, 9, and 11 report data from human
experiments, and we think the Reviewer provided them as reference material for us, rather than to ask
us to discuss this research in the manuscript. Reference 10 introduces an experimental paradigm to
study sequence encoding in rats, but it does not present results from actual studies of sequence
encoding. References 12, and 13 are very interesting animal studies that prompted us to make one
important clarification in our manuscript, namely the very definition of “sequence.” We have used this
term to refer to stimuli that are presented in temporal succession, with or without intervening gaps.
Reference 13, for example, does not probe memory for sequences, sensu our definition, because all
items of the “sequence” are visually present at the same time. Such a task probes pattern learning,
which is its intent, but not memory for sequences of stimuli as we intend it. This is now clarified in the
Discussion, mentioning that other studies are sometimes referred as “sequence” studies but do not
match our definition. Reference 12, on the other hand, is about what we have called “sequences” and
shows that squirrel monkeys demonstrate some ability to distinguish between two classes of sequences.
However, the habituation-dishabituation task used is of unclear significance for our purpose of probing
the mechanisms of working memory. The authors do not report the outcome of habituation, and the task
does not require the monkeys to make any specific response. That is, there is no correct or incorrect
response in this task and thus no assessment of discrimination abilities (the same holds of the
experiment on chimpanzees by Endress at al., reference 2 above). Note that we are not saying that such
experiments are not useful, just that they evaluate “spontaneous” responses that are not necessarily
indicative of responses that could be established with training. We have clarified this point in the
Discussion.
Reply to Reviewer 2
Reviewer 2 evaluates the topic as “interesting” and our modeling as “attractive,” but would like a few
clarifications, mostly regarding the comparison between human and non-human performance. We
discuss the Reviewer's concerns below, in the order they were raised:
1. We agree with the Reviewer that comparison between humans and other species requires care. The
Reviewer mentions three issues:
(a) Potentially human-centric stimuli: This is certainly a concern in some studies that have attempted to
train animals to recognize sequences of human syllables. These studies, however, are not included in
our review. We have compared humans and other species only in studies using easily perceived stimuli
(e.g., colored lights) or animal-centric stimuli, such as bird vocalizations. In all these cases, the animals
have no problem learning a response to single stimuli, implying that perception is not a problem. It is
only when sequential information is involved that the task becomes difficult. We have stressed this point
at the end of section 1 and in the third paragraph of section 2.
(b) Advantage of having the task explained: It is correct that humans receive always some sort of verbal
instructions. These, however, are not about correct responding, but rather about the mechanics of the
task. Animals receive these instructions in another way: by pre-training. This is typically extensive and
ensures that the animals are familiar with the basics of the task. We have never included the length of
pre-training in our analysis. We have stressed this point in the third paragraph of section 2.
(c) Language: We agree with the Reviewer that language may be helping humans to form explicit codes
for correct responses (e.g., press the button if you see red and then green). But the very fact that
language can express sequential information entails that humans can make sense of sequential
information. In other words, if we could not comprehend what “before” and “after” meant, we would
probably not have words for these concepts. We agree with the Reviewer, however, that language
acquisition may contribute to our sequence processing abilities, so that language may, indeed, play a
role in constructing a full fledged capacity for handling sequential information. We also agree that
studies on pre-verbal children (and children in general) would be illuminating, but we have found none
in the literature. We have added these remarks to the Discussion, and we hope our paper will stimulate
such research.
2. We have removed the expression “general purpose memory” in the Discussion, and instead referred
to memory for arbitrary stimuli, i.e., stimuli for which no specific adaptation exists.
3. We thank the Reviewer for providing these references, which we have included in the Discussion
about language.
4. We thank the Reviewer for providing these references. This and related work highlights the
importance of a memory for order. In these models, in fact, the structure of the environment is coded as
directional associations that respect the order in which events have occurred. The models would be
much less successful, we suspect, if associations were bi-directional, i.e., if they did not allow the
learning mechanism to remember the order of events. We feel, however, that discussing this work
meaningfully would take up considerable space.
5. We have checked Figures 3b and 3d and regenerated them. We apologize for the missing information
in the Reviewer's version, probably caused by a software incompatibility.
6. We have added details about inclusion of studies, including procedures and stimuli at the end of
Section 1. We think the two added paragraphs help frame our main question better, and provide
orientation to the reader for what follows. We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion.
7. We thank the Reviewer for this remark. We have clarified in the table legend that Table 1 is not
meant to list mutually exclusive phenomena, but to highlight areas of human behavior and cognition in
which sequential information is important.
Other changes
We have removed a table that was part of Figure 2 and displayed it as a separate table, Table 2 in the
revised manuscript.
