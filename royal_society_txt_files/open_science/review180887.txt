Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
I have reviewed this manuscript from the perspective of a mathematical epidemiologist who has
experience in infectious disease modelling, but is not an expert in the field of Tuberculosis (TB).
In the manuscript, the authors develop spatially coupled models to estimate the geographical
spread of TB from hotspots to distant regions in rural Ethiopia. The findings suggest that TB in
rural settings in Ethiopia is primarily driven by local transmission, rather than spillover from
hotspot regions.
This is an interesting article and the underlying methodological approach appears sound.
However, I have concerns over the presentation of sections of the manuscript from which
misunderstanding may arise if left unaddressed.
Major points
There are three main issues. The first is the absence of information surrounding the form of
deviance information criterion (DIC) that was used in the study. There are a couple of
calculations in common usage for the effective number of parameters of the model term, one of
the elements the DIC is comprised of. These are described by: (i) Spiegelhalter, Best, Carlin & van
der Linde. (2002) Bayesian measures of model complexity and fit in Journal of the Royal
Statistical Society, Series B 64(4): 583-639; (ii) Gelmin, Carlin, Stern & Rubin (2004) Bayesian Data
Analysis: Second Edition. Texts in Statistical Science. It would therefore be difficult to replicate
this analysis as described. Explicitly stating the DIC calculation (perhaps as a text section within
the supplementary material) would aid study reproducibility. Supporting references should also
be added.
There is also no information on how the reader should interpret the differences in DIC values.
The interpretation of DIC results may be augmented by including a short description on what
differences in DIC are considered notable.
The second issue involves choice of notation. In particular, I found distinguishing the differences
in meaning of ß<sub>i</sub> and ß<sub>ij</sub> troublesome. The description of the beta in
the WAIFW matrix is not provided at that point. Apologies if I have misunderstood, as using text
from the results (Parameter estimation subsection) I surmise ß<sub>i</sub> denotes mean
effective contact rates in region type i. In short, the intra-region effective contact rate. Please
present this information prior to referencing Figure 1. I recommend a greater differentiation in
notation to be made. One alternative would be adding a hat or tilde accent to the
ß<sub>ij</sub> term.
Additionally, there are examples of inconsistent use of notation that need to be rectified. In Figure
1, Model D and text surrounding it the notation used for the three coupling proportions is <U+03C1>, p
and <U+03B9>? But in Table 2 and Supplementary Material Figure 5, the coupling parameters listed for
model D are <U+03C1><sub>HA</sub>, <U+03C1><sub>AR</sub>, <U+03C1><sub>HR</sub>. Please switch notation
used in Figure 1 to match the remainder of the manuscript.
Third, though the response given to previous reviewer comments are mostly adequate, on more
than one occasion the authors have not integrated the response text into the manuscript. For
3
example, to fully address the comment made by Reviewer 2, Comment 8 (What fraction of
diseased individuals were assumed to be infectious?), the response needs to be incorporated into
the main text and the parameter value for fraction of active TB compartment assumed to be
infectious added to Table 1. Other instances are outlined in the specific comments.
Please find below line-by-line comments which I think would help enhance the quality and
clarity of the manuscript.
Specific comments
Introduction
Page 1, lines 1-2: “Tuberculosis (TB) is now the world’s leading infectious killer…” To provide
additional context, what is the magnitude of cases on a global scale? What is the typical TB
caseload and mortality due to TB in Ethiopia?
Page 2, line 2: In the final sentence of the introduction, revise “from hotspots a remote region of
Ethiopia”.
Introduction can motivate the study more by highlighting use of such frameworks in studies of
other diseases (such as measles).
Methods
Top of page 6: Define N<sub>j</sub>. and please state that the force of infection calculation uses
a frequency-dependent transmission assumption.
Page 6, Paragraph 1, Line 2: Amend “makes within individuals” to “makes with individuals”
Page 6, Paragraph 2, Line 4: Write “M.tb” in full
Page 7: In the system of ODES, dS<sub>i</sub>/dt equation, I suspect the second term is
missing a S<sub>i</sub> in the numerator. Across all ODE equations readability could be
somewhat enhanced by using the <U+03BB><sub>i</sub> notation denoting the force of infection.
Pages 6-8: What does the p in Figure 2 and the system of ODEs denote?
Page 8 (Model fitting): From the viewpoint of a reader interested in the model fitting procedure,
providing the equation for the likelihood calculation as a supplementary item would be
appreciated.
Page 8 (Model fitting): Prior distributions, explicitly state the bounds employed for the uniform
priors in the main text.
Page 8 (Model fitting): Was any thinning of the MCMC samples performed?
Page 8, Line 17 (Model fitting): Reword “as a burn-ins”.
Page 9 (Parameterisation): Case detection rates are presented in two different formats (proportion
and percentage). Given use of proportions in Table 1 for this parameter, to maintain consistency
alter 60% to 0.60.
Could the authors expand on the software used to perform the analysis? What was the MATLAB
version number, and were any additional libraries used to carry out the analysis?

Results
Page 11, Paragraph 1: On writing style, the authors may want to consider avoiding sentences that
give no information other than directing the reader to a figure. For example, may remove the
sentence “Figure 2 in the Supplementary material…” and add (Supplementary material, Figure 2)
at the end of the paragraph.
Page 11, Paragraph 2: Related to the previous point, the authors may consider rephrasing this
passage along the lines of “Our model could capably reproduce the notification rates that were
previously used to estimate the set of model parameters (Figure 3).”
Page 11, Paragraph 2: The argument for the simulated results having reasonable correspondence
with observed data can be strengthened by reporting in the main text the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test results given to Reviewer 2, Comment 18.
Page 12, “Simulation of the impact of improving case detection in hotspots on the neighbouring
regions” subsection: The opening couple of sentences from this section of the results seem like
they should be in the methods to establish the premise of the simulation study. It was not clear to
me this was a question being addressed until the results.
Pages 12-13, “Simulation of the impact of improving case detection in hotspots on the
neighbouring regions” subsection: The quantities displayed in the text relate solely to when the
case detection rate was set at its baseline value. This section would benefit from reporting the
quantities of interest for a sample of the alternatively tested case detection rates.
Discussion
Page 16, Paragraph 1, Line 5: I was unclear on what the DOTS programme acronym stood for.
Please clarify what this means to people who don’t know about the scheme.
Page 16, Paragraph 3, Line 5: Authors state the study considers drug-sensitive TB only. This is an
important assumption. It would benefit the manuscript by it being acknowledged earlier in the
piece, for example within the methods when introducing the model formulation.
Tables and Figures
Table 1: Typo in caption “* in hotpots”; Parameters column is missing symbolic descriptors for
relapse & protection against infection from latency.
Figure 2: Apologies if I have misunderstood, but I am not convinced the rates attached to
infection flows are correct in their present form across all models. Please clarify the writing, or
consider amending flows to incorporate the force of infection term <U+03BB><sub>i</sub> and make
clear those parameters that are region dependent. In the caption, consider restating the
compartment definitions to assist understanding of the model structure.
Figure 3: Please add labels to y-axes
.
Supp. Material. Figure 1: High-High, Low-Low etc descriptions were unclear to me. Would like
to see an explanation of these terms in the caption.
Supp. Material. Figure 2: Would add value to the figure by stating the fitted parametric
distribution parameter values within the caption. Can then remove the fitted gamma distribution
parameter values from the main text.

Comments to the Author:
I recommend major revisions in accordance with the reviewers' comments.
Associate Editor: 2
Comments to the Author:
There are issues about the definitions of spatial models versus compartmentalised models. Spatial
models would imply the use of partial differential equations as a model for describing the
physical problem. This is not the case here, instead it is a compartmental model. Due to lack of
detailed information about the modelling framework, it is difficult to gauge the premises on
which the modelling was constructed. I therefore recommend further peer reviewing of the
manuscript. It is not clear (i) if the models were considered in dimensional or non-dimenstional,
(ii) there is a lack of mathematical analysis and (iii) how the model equations where solved
computationally.

Appendix A
Referee report on a manuscript RSOS-180887, “The role of
geospatial hotspots in the spatial spread of tuberculosis in rural
Ethiopia: A mathematical modelling” by D. Shaweno, J.M.
Trauer, J.T. Denholm, E.S. McBryde
This paper has developed and analysed a multi-patch model for the spatio-temporal dy-
namics of tuberculosis in remote regions of rural Ethiopia. The authors propose a model that
includes two types of latent compartments, and explore different types of mixing between
individuals, as represented by WAIFW matrices. Using available case-notification data, the
authors then proceed to identify the best fit for parameters, and explore correlations between
them. Overall, the paper is very interesting, and I am happy to recommend publication, pro-
vided the authors address the following minor issues.
1) At the top of p. 5, please mention explicitly in the text which type of coupling corresponds
to which matrix in Fig. 1, as currently Figs. 1B and C are not independently mentioned or
discussed.
2) p. 5, l. 36 , the authors mentioned “the terms ßij ”, but in the matrices there are only ß1 ,
ß2 , and ß3 . Perhaps, the authors meant that the full matrices in Fig. 1 represent ßij , but
this then has to be explicitly stated to avoid ambiguity.
3) p. 6, l. 8, when introducing ßij , is it really just the number of contacts? I mean, shouldnt
it also include the per-contact probability of transmission, as otherwise, the model assumes
that every single contact results in the transmission of infection, which is hardly realistic?
4) p. 6, l. 35, the authors say that susceptible individuals are replenished by births, which,
presumably, is represented by the parameter p in the model. Some comment should be made
about why this term is taken as a constant rather than a constant multiplying the total pop-
ulation, and also its value of this parameter is not provided in any of the simulations, so it
is not clear how it was chosen or estimated.
Also, there is a clash in notation: the same letter p is used in the model to denote the
influx of new susceptibles, and in matrix D in Fig. 1 to denote a coupling proportion.
5) p. 7, parameter p in Fig. 2 and in the model is not defined, and it should be properly
introduced.
6) p. 8, l. 7, in <U+03BB>ij , I guess the second index should be y in agreement with what the authors
discuss in l. 16.
7) p. 8, l. 33, what is L in L<U+03B8>?
8) p. 8, ll. 45-47, please be consistent with CDR and write either 0.65 and 0.6, or 65% and
60%.
9) p. 10, it is not clear how could model C perform better than D if model D also includes
C as a particular case for the choice of parameters i = <U+03C1>2 and p = <U+03C1>. The authors should
1
provide an clear explanation of why this is the case.
10) p. 11, I dont understand what is shown by blue lines in Fig. 3: the authors say that the
dashed blue lines represent “observed notification rates over five years”, but since these are
all vertical lines of equal height, it is not at all clear what they actually represent, or how
they fit against the simulated notification rates. The authors should comment on this.
I also have two small suggestions:
p. 4, l. 5: please change “hotspots a remote” to hotspots to a remote”
p. 12, l. 53, change “a unit of 5 into “multiples of 5%”.

The following document contains our responses to the issues raised by associate
editors and reviewers. Please find our responses embedded in the following text
after each reviewer’s comments.
Associate Editor: 1
Comments to the Author:
I recommend major revisions in accordance with the reviewers' comments.
Authors response: We have provided a point by point response to all the
comments below.
Associate Editor: 2
Comments to the Author:
There are issues about the definitions of spatial models versus compartmentalised
models. Spatial models would imply the use of partial differential equations as a
model for describing the physical problem. This is not the case here, instead it is a
compartmental model. Due to lack of detailed information about the modelling
framework, it is difficult to gauge the premises on which the modelling was
constructed. I therefore recommend further peer reviewing of the manuscript. It is
not clear (i) if the models were considered in dimensional or non-dimenstional, (ii)
there is a lack of mathematical analysis and (iii) how the model equations where
solved computationally.
Authors response:
Population-level spatially structured models can fall into either metapopulation
models (spatial patch models) or spatially continuous models which assume the
population is continuously distributed across space rather than distributed into
discrete subpopulations. The latter group of models are modelled using partial
differential equations, while the former are modelled using ordinary differential
equations. The modelling framework used in this study falls into the
metapopulation model where the underlying population is divided into three
spatial groups (based on disease burden) which are allowed to interact using
coupling terms which we denoted using a matrix often referred to as “WAIFW”.
While spatial models aim to capture the spread of infection across space,
compartments capture the progression of disease in individuals. In order to fully
capture the rate at which infection progresses in space, it is essential to describe its
progression in individuals, which is essentially done using compartmental a
framework (1).
1
(i) if the models were considered in dimensional or non-dimenstional
In this analysis, space is considered discrete and divided into three spatial
subgroups rather than continuous and so solved with ODEs rather than partial
differential equations. This approach is widely used to deal with spatial mixing in
infectious disease modelling (1). The discrete spatial variable is one dimension in
the model, the state of infectiousness is another and time is the third dimension.
(ii) there is a lack of mathematical analysis and
The details of mathematical (numerical) analysis and the codes used are
available from the Dryad Digital Repository (2).
(iii) how the model equations where solved computationally
Authors response: The system of ordinary differential equation was solved using
Runge-Kutta algorithm (accessed using an inbuilt ODE solver called ode45 in
Matlab). This information is now provided in the main manuscript, beneath the
system of ODEs.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
I have reviewed this manuscript from the perspective of a mathematical
epidemiologist who has experience in infectious disease modelling, but is not an
expert in the field of Tuberculosis (TB). In the manuscript, the authors develop
spatially coupled models to estimate the geographical spread of TB from hotspots
to distant regions in rural Ethiopia. The findings suggest that TB in rural settings in
Ethiopia is primarily driven by local transmission, rather than spillover from
hotspot regions.
. This is an interesting article and the underlying methodological approach appears
sound. However, I have concerns over the presentation of sections of the
manuscript from which misunderstanding may arise if left unaddressed.
Authors response: We thank the reviewer for the positive remarks
Major points
1. There are three main issues. The first is the absence of information surrounding
the form of deviance information criterion (DIC) that was used in the study. There
are a couple of calculations in common usage for the effective number of
parameters of the model term, one of the elements the DIC is comprised of. These
are described by: (i) Spiegelhalter, Best, Carlin & van der Linde. (2002) Bayesian
2
measures of model complexity and fit in Journal of the Royal Statistical Society,
Series B 64(4): 583-639; (ii) Gelmin, Carlin, Stern & Rubin (2004) Bayesian Data
Analysis: Second Edition. Texts in Statistical Science. It would therefore be difficult
to replicate this analysis as described. Explicitly stating the DIC calculation
(perhaps as a text section within the supplementary material) would aid study
reproducibility. Supporting references should also be added. There is also no
information on how the reader should interpret the differences in DIC values. The
interpretation of DIC results may be augmented by including a short description on
what differences in DIC are considered notable
Authors response: In this study, we computed deviance information
criteria as follows based on an approach presented in Spiegelhalter et al.
(2002).
Deviance is defined as -2 times the log-likelihood and can be written as:
D (y, <U+03B8>) = -2log p (y/ <U+03B8>) …………………………………………..(3)
Having defined deviance in this way, deviance information criteria (DIC) can
be computed as follows:
DIC = <U+0001D437>¯ + PD ……………………………………………………………. [2]
Where, <U+0001D437> ¯ is the expected posterior value of deviance (-2 times the average
of the log- likelihood ratios) and PD is the effective number of parameters in
the model, which is calculated as the difference between the posterior mean
of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters
(likelihood ratio evaluated at the average of the parameters) of interest.
Adding PD to the posterior mean deviance (<U+0001D437> ¯ ) gives a deviance information
criteria for comparing models (4).
Models with the minimum DIC estimates indicate models with a better fit,
although there is no universal agreement on the magnitude of the difference
between different DIC values to constitute a meaningful difference. A
general rule of thumb suggests that differences of more than 10 might
definitely rule out the model with the higher DIC, differences between 5 and
10 are substantial (5).
3
The information is provided in the supplementary material, page 1 and we
also included our approach briefly into the main text as (Methods section,
Model fitting subsection, paragraph 2, lines 18-22)
“We calculated DIC as the sum of the expected posterior value of deviance (-
2 times the average of the log- likelihood ratios) and the effective number of
parameters in the model, described as the difference between the posterior
mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the
parameters (likelihood ratio evaluated at the average of the parameters) of
interest (4)”.
2. The second issue involves choice of notation. In particular, I found
distinguishing the differences in meaning of ß<sub>i</sub> and
ß<sub>ij</sub> troublesome. The description of the beta in the WAIFW
matrix is not provided at that point. Apologies if I have misunderstood, as
using text from the results (Parameter estimation subsection) I surmise
ß<sub>i</sub> denotes mean effective contact rates in region type i. In
short, the intra-region effective contact rate. Please present this
information prior to referencing Figure 1. I recommend a greater
differentiation in notation to be made. One alternative would be adding a
hat or tilde accent to the ß<sub>ij</sub> term.
Authors response: we have now provided a description of ßij in sufficient
detail as follows (Methods section, Model assumptions on spatial coupling
subsection, paragraph 1):
“The dynamics of TB were assumed to be identical in the three patches,
except for the transmission parameter, which we calibrated on the basis of
notification rates in each region. To capture transmission from a hotspot
region to the other two regions and vice versa, we developed a cross-
coupled metapopulation model by defining contact matrices referred to as
4
WAIFW (“who acquires infection from whom”) matrices that represent the
strength of interaction within and between regions (6) as:
ß11 ß12 ß13
[ß21 ß22 ß23 ]
ß31 ß32 ß33
where the diagonal elements, ßii (ß11, ß22 and ß33) of the WAIFW matrix
represent the average per capita effective contact rates per year that an
individual in region i makes with individuals in region i, while the off-
diagonal elements (ßij) represent the average per capita effective contact
rates per year that an individual in region j makes with individuals in region
i. The degree of coupling between patches is assumed to be smaller than the
degree of interaction within patches, such that the values of the off-diagonal
elements are found by multiplying the appropriate within-group
transmission parameter by the appropriate coupling proportion according
to the following four different scenarios considered regarding coupling
between regions”.
We have also corrected inconsistences in the use of subscripts in the manuscript
(table 2) and the supplementary material (Figures 5 and 6)

3. Reviewers comments: Additionally, there are examples of inconsistent use of
notation that need to be rectified. In Figure 1, Model D and text surrounding it the
notation used for the three coupling proportions is <U+03C1>, p and <U+03B9>? But in Table 2 and
Supplementary Material Figure 5, the coupling parameters listed for model D are
<U+03C1><sub>HA <U+03C1><sub>AR</sub>, <U+03C1><sub>HR</sub>. Please switch notation used in Figure
1 to match the remainder of the manuscript.
Authors response: We thank the review for noticing this inconsistency. We have
now revised the notations used in table 1 and figures 5 and 6 (in the supplementary
material) to match figure 1 (in the manuscript).
4. Reviewers comments: Third, though the response given to previous reviewer
comments are mostly adequate, on more than one occasion the authors have not
integrated the response text into the manuscript. For example, to fully address the
comment made by Reviewer 2, Comment 8 (What fraction of diseased individuals
were assumed to be infectious?), the response needs to be incorporated into the
main text and the parameter value for fraction of active TB compartment assumed
to be infectious added to Table 1. Other instances are outlined in the specific
comments.
Authors response: The fraction of TB considered infectious is included in page 7
the methods section, paragraph 1, last lines 13-15 as follows:
“In the model, only a fraction of diseased individuals comprising all
smear-positive and 22% of smear-negative TB patients is considered
infectious in line with a previous report that 17-22% of smear-
negative TB cases are infectious (7)”
Please find below line-by-line comments which I think would help enhance the
quality and clarity of the manuscript.
Specific comments
Introduction
5. Page 1, lines 1-2: “Tuberculosis (TB) is now the world’s leading infectious killer…”
To provide additional context, what is the magnitude of cases on a global scale?
What is the typical TB caseload and mortality due to TB in Ethiopia?
Authors response: We have now included the case load and mortality both at the
global scale and Ethiopia to make the context very clear as follows: (Introduction
section, paragraph 1, lines 1-2)
6
“Tuberculosis (TB) is now the world’s leading infectious killer with an
estimated 10.4 million cases and 1.7 million deaths in 2016. In the same
year, TB caused 182,000 cases and 30,000 deaths in Ethiopia leaving the
country among the list of the top 30 TB high burden countries (8)”.
6. Page 2, line 2: In the final sentence of the introduction, revise “from hotspots a
remote region of Ethiopia”.
Authors response: we have incorporated revised the sentence as follows.
“In this study, we aim to understand the geographic spread of TB from
hotspots to regions located at different distances in a remote region of
Ethiopia”.
7. Introduction can motivate the study more by highlighting use of such
frameworks in studies of other diseases (such as measles).
Authors response: We have now incorporated the wider application of the study
framework we used in this study as follows (Introduction section, paragraph 3,
lines 4-6)
“Although considerable advancements in the methods used to
investigate the spatial diffusion of infectious diseases such as measles
has been made in the last decades (9-11), only few modelling studies
were able to apply such methods in the investigation of spatial
transmission of TB by incorporating spatial structure”
Methods
8. Top of page 6: Define N<sub>j</sub>. and please state that the force of infection
calculation uses a frequency-dependent transmission assumption.
Authors response: We have inserted the description of Nj along with the
description of other terms as follows:
“Ij and Nj refer to the number of infectious TB cases and total
population in spatial group j,……”
Similarly, we have stated that the force of infection is based on frequency-
dependent assumption (Methods section, page 6, lines 2-4) as follows:
“The force of infection on the ith group, <U+03BB>i assumes a frequency-
dependent transmission and is therefore a weighted sum of
infectious TB prevalence in the different spatial groups”.
7
9. Page 6, Paragraph 1, Line 2: Amend “makes within individuals” to “makes with
individuals”
Authors response: Amended as suggested.
10. Page 6, Paragraph 2, Line 4: Write “<i>M.tb</i>” in full
Authors response: Amended as suggested.
11. Page 7: In the system of ODES, dS<sub>i</sub>/dt equation, I suspect the second
term is missing a S<sub>i</sub> in the numerator. Across all ODE equations
readability could be somewhat enhanced by using the <U+03BB><sub>i</sub> notation
denoting the force of infection.
Authors response: Thank you for noticing the missing term, Si, which we have
included now. In addition, to enhance the readability we have replaced the whole
expression for the force of infection in the system of ODE with <U+0001D706><U+0001D456> . (Please see ODE
in the methods section, page 7-8)
12. Pages 6-8: What does the p in Figure 2 and the system of ODEs denote?
Authors response: p in figure 2 and the ODEs denotes the partial protection
conferred by previous infection with tuberculosis. For clarity, we have placed the
symbol ‘p’ in table 1.
13. Page 8 (Model fitting): From the viewpoint of a reader interested in the model
fitting procedure, providing the equation for the likelihood calculation as a
supplementary item would be appreciated.
Authors response: In this analysis we used Poisson likelihood in the model fitting
as follows:
3 5
<U+0001D706><U+0001D458> <U+0001D452> -<U+0001D706>
<U+0001D43F><U+0001D456><U+0001D458><U+0001D452><U+0001D459><U+0001D456>h<U+0001D45C><U+0001D45C><U+0001D451> = <U+220F> <U+220F>
<U+0001D458>!
<U+0001D456>=1 <U+0001D457>=1
The subscript i takes values from 1 to 3 to index each spatial patch, and the
subscript j takes values from 1 to 5 to index years. <U+03BA> refers to the observed
notification and <U+03BB> represents the expected Poison mean which is the model
estimated notification. This information is provided in the supplementary
material
14. Page 8 (Model fitting): Prior distributions, explicitly state the bounds employed
for the uniform priors in the main text.
8
Authors response: We have incorporated the information about the priors
and their bounds in the main text (Methods section, model fitting
subsection, paragraph 2, line 9-10) as:
“…. assigning a uniform prior distribution between 0 and 1 for all
proportions and all rates for which plausible values were < 1(for the
parameter set)”.
15. Page 8 (Model fitting): Was any thinning of the MCMC samples performed?
Authors response: We did not use thinning.
16. Page 8, Line 17 (Model fitting): Reword “as a burn-ins”.
Authors response: We have now reworded as “a burn-in “
17. Page 9 (Parameterisation): Case detection rates are presented in two different
formats (proportion and percentage). Given use of proportions in Table 1 for this
parameter, to maintain consistency alter 60% to 0.60.
Authors response: Amended as suggested.
18. Could the authors expand on the software used to perform the analysis? What
was the MATLAB version number, and were any additional libraries used to carry
out the analysis?
Authors response: Information regarding the MATLAB version and other libraries
used in this analysis is given below and the same information is also provided in the
main text (Model fitting subsection, paragraph 2, line 9).
The model was coded in MATLAB- R2015b (The MathWorks, 2015) and some
of the plots were produced using ggplot2 library in R version 3.3.1.
Results
19. Page 11, Paragraph 1: On writing style, the authors may want to consider
avoiding sentences that give no information other than directing the reader to a
figure. For example, may remove the sentence “Figure 2 in the Supplementary
material…” and add (Supplementary material, Figure 2) at the end of the paragraph.
Authors response: Suggested modifications have been made – see paragraph
beneath table 2.
20. Page 11, Paragraph 2: Related to the previous point, the authors may consider
rephrasing this passage along the lines of “Our model could capably reproduce the
notification rates that were previously used to estimate the set of model
parameters (Figure 3).”
9
Authors response: Suggested modifications have been made – see paragraph 2
beneath table 2
21. Page 11, Paragraph 2: The argument for the simulated results having reasonable
correspondence with observed data can be strengthened by reporting in the main
text the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test results given to Reviewer 2, Comment 18.
Authors response: The reported suggestions have been incorporated into the
main text (paragraph 2 underneath table 2) as:
“We also tested if both the observed and simulated data came from the same
underlying distribution using Kolmogrorov-Smirnov test. The test indicated
that both the observed data and the simulated data came from the same
underlying distribution for all the three patches (Hotspots: D=0.36, p-
value=0.54, Adjacent region: D=0.54, p-value=0.11, Remote region: D=0.31, p-
value=0.71)”.
22. Page 12, “Simulation of the impact of improving case detection in hotspots on
the neighbouring regions” subsection: The opening couple of sentences from this
section of the results seem like they should be in the methods to establish the
premise of the simulation study. It was not clear to me this was a question being
addressed until the results.
Authors response: We agree with the reviewer that we introduced “simulation”
late in the results section. Now we have provided that information in the methods
section, Simulation of the impact of interventions in hotspots on the spatial spread
of TB” subsection as follows:
Simulation of the impact of interventions in hotspots on the
spatial spread of TB
To estimate the extent to which hotspots contributed to TB
transmission in the two non-hotspot regions, we first ran the model
to equilibrium using the best fitting parameters values. We
subsequently modified the case detection rate only in the hotspots
from 65% (baseline value) using increments of 5% to understand the
effect this might have on the burden of TB in the two non-hotspot
regions.
23. Pages 12-13, “Simulation of the impact of improving case detection in hotspots
on the neighbouring regions” subsection: The quantities displayed in the text relate
solely to when the case detection rate was set at its baseline value. This section
would benefit from reporting the quantities of interest for a sample of the
alternatively tested case detection rates.
10
Authors response: we have incorporated the suggested changes as (Results
section, Simulation of the impact of improving case detection in hotspots on
the neighbouring regions subsection, paragraph 1):
“…. the proportion of TB infection in an adjacent region due to mixing with
hotspots was about 76% (95 % CrI: 52%, 92%,); and was 2.5% (95 %CrI: 0.7%,
3.2%) in the remote regions in the first five years at a baseline case detection
rate in hotspots (Figure 5). That is, out of 771 (95% CrI: 258, 1736) secondary
infections in the adjacent region, 593 (95% CrI: 237, 904) were generated due
to mixing with hotspots. As a result, improving CDR in the hotspot regions
has significant impact on the neighbouring region. For instance, the
proportion of infections in the adjacent regions due to mixing with hotspot
regions drops by 10% down to 65% (95% CrI: 37%, 86%) when case detection
rate in the hotspot regions goes from 65 percent (the baseline) to 70 percent.
Similarly, when case detection rate goes from 65 percent to 95 percent, the
proportion of infections in the adjacent regions due to mixing with hotspot
regions drops down to 16% (95% CrI: 7%, 39%). However, the effect of the
same intervention is only marginal in the remote regions. (Figure 5).
Discussion
24. Page 16, Paragraph 1, Line 5: I was unclear on what the DOTS programme
acronym stood for. Please clarify what this means to people who don’t know about
the scheme.
Authors response: The abbreviation is expanded for clarity in Discussion section,
paragraph 6, line 7 as “directly observed treatment short course (DOTS)”
25. Page 16, Paragraph 3, Line 5: Authors state the study considers drug-sensitive
TB only. This is an important assumption. It would benefit the manuscript by it
being acknowledged earlier in the piece, for example within the methods when
introducing the model formulation.
Authors response: we have mentioned this information in the methods section in
the revised text (Methods section, page 7, paragraph 2, line 15) as:
“The dynamic transmission model only captures drug-susceptible
TB”.
Tables and Figures
26. Table 1: Typo in caption “* in hotpots”; Parameters column is missing symbolic
11
descriptors for relapse & protection against infection from latency.
Authors response: The missing letter “s” is now inserted to make the word
“hotspots” and the missing symbolic descriptors of the two listed parameters
inserted (please see table 1)
27. Figure 2: Apologies if I have misunderstood, but I am not convinced the rates
attached to infection flows are correct in their present form across all models.
Please clarify the writing, or consider amending flows to incorporate the force of
infection term <U+03BB><sub>i</sub> and make clear those parameters that are region
dependent. In the caption, consider restating the compartment definitions to assist
understanding of the model structure.
Authors response: We agree with the reviewer that the flows do not clearly show
region dependence of some parameters. Now we have made revisions to the
notations including the force of infection by adding subscripts where appropriate
(see figure 2).
28. Figure 3: Please add labels to y-axes
Authors response: We have included label on y axis in figure 3
Supp. Material. Figure 1: High-High, Low-Low etc descriptions were unclear to me.
Would like to see an explanation of these terms in the caption.
Authors response: we have now added additional descriptions to clarify these
concepts (Supplementary material, page 1) as:
“Figure 1: Spatial distribution of TB in Sheka Zone, 2010-2014. Panel A shows the
spatial clustering according to local moran’s I, where High-High (also called
hotspot) indicates that high incidence regions are next to high incidence regions.
Similarly, Low-Low indicates that areas with significantly lower diseases burden are
neighbouring regions with significantly low values. High-Low or low high clusters
indicate spatial outliers where high incidence regions are next to low incidence
regions. Panel B shows the spatial metapopulation structure used in this analysis
(red-hotspot region, orange-adjacent region and grey-remote region)”
29. Supp. Material. Figure 2: Would add value to the figure by stating the fitted
parametric distribution parameter values within the caption. Can then remove the
fitted gamma distribution parameter values from the main text.
Authors response: we have moved the fitted parameter values for the
distributions from the main text to figure 2 in the supplementary material.

To demonstrate convergence of the MCMC fitting procedure, please add the sample
trace plots given in response to Reviewer 2, Comment 11 as a supplementary figure.
Authors response: We have provided the sample trace plots as a supplementary
figure (figure 7).
Reviewer: 2
This paper has developed and analysed a multi-patch model for the spatiotemporal
dynamics of tuberculosis in remote regions of rural Ethiopia. The authors propose a
model that includes two types of latent compartments, and explore different types
of mixing between individuals, as represented by WAIFW matrices. Using available
case-notification data, the authors then proceed to identify the best fit for
parameters, and explore correlations between them. Overall, the paper is very
interesting, and I am happy to recommend publication, provided the authors
address the following minor issues.
Authors response: We thank the reviewer for the positive comments
1). At the top of p. 5, please mention explicitly in the text which type of coupling
corresponds to which matrix in Fig. 1, as currently Figs. 1B and C are not
independently mentioned or discussed.
Authors response: We have now cited (Figure 1, Models B and C) in our
description of the models in the main text as (Methods section, Model
assumptions on spatial coupling subsection, paragraph 2, lines 5-6)
“Next, we introduced coupling between regions with a single mixing
parameter, such that neighbouring regions (i.e. hotspot with adjacent and
adjacent with remote) have equal mixing and non-neighbouring regions mix
to a lesser degree (i.e. hotspot with remote)(Figure 1, Models B and C)”.
2) p. 5, 1. 36, the authors mentioned “the terms ßij", but in the matrices,
there are only ß1, ß2, and ß3. Perhaps, the authors meant that the full
matrices in Fig. 1 represent ßij, but this then has to be explicitly stated to
avoid ambiguity.
Authors response: As the reviewer pointed out, all the elements in the
matrices of figure 1 represent ßij. However, the matrices we provided were a
bit confusing and now we have rewritten the matrices clearly and provided
detailed description to clarify the confusion. (Please see our response to the
1st reviewer’s comment 2 above and the main text (Methods section, Model
assumptions on spatial coupling subsection, paragraph 1)
13
3) p. 6, l. 8, when introducing ßij, is it really just the number of contacts? I
mean, shouldn’t it also include the per-contact probability of transmission,
as otherwise, the model assumes that every single contact results in the
transmission of infection, which is hardly realistic?
Authors response: The Bij terms in the matrices are the per capita effective
contact rates – i.e. contacts that would result in transmission were they to
occur between an S and an I, and so are not just the number of contacts
made.
This is now clarified in the manuscript, (Model assumptions on spatial
coupling subsection paragraph 1, lines 7-11)
“……where the diagonal elements, ßii (ß11, ß22 and ß33) of the WAIFW matrix
represent the average per-capita effective contact rates per year that an
individual in region i makes with individuals in region i, while the off-
diagonal elements (ßij) represent the average per-capita effective contact
rates per year that an individual in region j makes with individuals in region
i. An effective contact is one that results in transmission of an infection
provided one of the contact pair is infectious and the other susceptible”.
4) p. 6, l. 35, the authors say that susceptible individuals are replenished by
births, which, presumably, is represented by the parameter p in the model.
Some comment should be made about why this term is taken as a constant
rather than a constant multiplying the total population, and also its value of
this parameter is not provided in any of the simulations, so it is not clear
how it was chosen or estimated.
Also, there is a clash in notation: the same letter _ is used in the model to
denote the
influx of new susceptible, and in matrix D in Fig. 1 to denote a coupling
proportion.
Authors response: Apologies for insufficient description there. The p parameter,
now defined as <U+03C8> to avoid the clash in notations, was multiplied by total population
of each patch. In this model to keep the population constant, births were replaced
by the total number of deaths from each compartment as follows: <U+03C8>i =
14
<U+0001D707>(<U+0001D446><U+0001D456> + <U+0001D438><U+0001D456> + <U+0001D43F><U+0001D456> + <U+0001D445><U+0001D456> ) + <U+0001D707><U+0001D451> <U+0001D43C><U+0001D456> . We have now provided this description
underneath the system of ODEs in the main text and model diagram (figure 2) for
clarity (Please see revisions in the system of ODEs in the main text)
5) p. 7, parameter p in Fig. 2 and in the model, is not defined, and it should be
properly
introduced.
Authors response: “p is the relative risk of infection of a person exposed to TB
who has previously been infected (assumed to take values between 0 and 1)”. We
have now provided descriptions of this term in table 1 and in Figure 2.
6) p. 8, l. 7, in <U+03BB>ij , I guess the second index should be y in agreement with
what the authors discuss in l. 16.
Authors response: Thank you for spotting that inconsistency. We have now
replaced y by j to index a year.
7) p. 8, l. 33, what is L in L<U+03B8>?
Authors response: L refers to likelihood. To avoid confusion, we have provided the
abbreviation along with the full description in the main text as (Model fitting
subsection, paragraph 2, line 13):
“Then the likelihood of the new candidate parameter set <U+03B8>* given the data
written as L(<U+03B8>*) .......
8) p. 8, ll. 45-47, please be consistent with CDR and write either 0.65 and 0.6, or 65%
and
60%.
Authors response: We have now rewritten 60% as 0.60 for consistency. (Please see
parameterisation subsection, paragraph 1, line 3)
9) p. 10, it is not clear how could model C perform better than D if model D also
includes
C as a particular case for the choice of parameters <U+03B9> = <U+03C1>2 and p = <U+03C1>. The authors
should
provide and clear explanation of why this is the case.
Authors response: The reviewer is correct in saying that model D is a
generalisation of model C and should thus be at least as good a fit, hence the
deviance of model D should be lower than the deviance of model C (which it is). The
DIC however penalises model D with the addition of the parameters to the
calculation. Hence DIC (like AIC) provides an indication of both goodness of fit and
model parsimony, in an effort to find the best model in terms of these two traits.
This has now been clarified in the manuscript…
In the first results paragraph under model comparisons section we write
15
“DIC assesses different models in terms of their trade-off between goodness
of fit and model parsimony (4)”.
10) p. 11, I don’t understand what is shown by blue lines in Fig. 3: the authors say
that the
dashed blue lines represent “observed notification rates over five years", but since
these are
all vertical lines of equal height, it is not at all clear what they actually represent, or
how
they fit against the simulated notification rates. The authors should comment on
this.
Authors response: Yes, the blue vertical lines are the observed notification rates.
Because we have only one notification rate per year, each vertical line represents
the position of the value of notification rate in relation to the distribution of the
simulated notification. As an observed notification rate per year has no frequency
distribution, and is a scalar quantity, the height of the blue vertical line has no
meaning.
I also have two small suggestions:
11). p. 4, l. 5: please change \hotspots a remote" to hotspots to a remote"
Authors response: We have revised the section and the revised section reads as
“In this study, we aim to understand the geographic spread of TB
from hotspots to regions located at different distances in a remote
region of Ethiopia”.
12). p. 12, l. 53, change “a unit of 5 into multiples of 5%".
Authors response: We have incorporated the suggestion. The revision can be
found in the methods section, Simulation of the impact of interventions in hotspots
on the spatial spread of TB subsection, paragraph 1, line 4) as
“…. We subsequently modified the case detection rate only in the hotspots
from 65% (baseline value) using increments of 5% to understand the effect
this might have on the burden of TB in the two non-hotspot regions”

s is a resubmission of a paper developing spatially coupled models to estimate the geographical
ead of TB from hotspots to distant regions in rural Ethiopia. I appreciate the care the authors have
en to address reviewer comments. For me, the manuscript is much clearer. Please find below line-by-
comments detailing remaining minor concerns.
thods
e 5 (Parameter notation in Model D): The explanation surrounding Figure 1 has vastly improved. To
her simplify notation, I would look to have all parameters surrounding connectivity use notation
olving <U+0001D70C>. This was the intention of my related comment on this item in my initial review, and I
logise to the authors if I did not convey the change I had in mind clearly. With that in mind, in Model
would revert the use of <U+0001D70C>, <U+0001D70B>, <U+0001D70F> to the notation <U+0001D70C><U+0001D43B><U+0001D434> , <U+0001D70C><U+0001D434><U+0001D445> , <U+0001D70C><U+0001D43B><U+0001D445> that was previously used in Table 2 and
plementary Material Figure 5.
e 6 (Force of Infection equation): Below the equation, it is stated that <U+0001D43C><U+0001D457> refers to number of
ctious TB cases (in spatial group <U+0001D457>). State <U+0001D43C> is also stated to denote individuals with active TB,
ough only a fraction of them are infectious (if I have understood correctly?). To avoid confusion, I
ommend restating the definition of <U+0001D43C><U+0001D457> as being the number of individuals with active TB in spatial
up <U+0001D457>, and then including the fraction of infection cases term within the force of infection equation
e next comment).
es 7-8 (System of ODEs): The fraction of infection cases term (<U+0001D711>) is omitted from the equations.
er add to each individual equation where required, or place into the force of infection term. If
ing to the force of infection term, please also amend Figure 2 to reflect such a change.
e 8 (System of ODEs): When stating the use of Runge-Kutta algorithm, add that the package that was
d and the software to perform the numerical calculations were ode45 and Matlab, respectively.
e 9 (Simulation of the impact of interventions, 2nd line): Thanks to the authors for adding this detail
he methods. My understanding is this simulation work was done with the best fitting model, and so
uld add “we first ran the best fitting model” in place of “we first ran the model”.
e 9 (Simulation of the impact of interventions): The added text states the case detection rate (CDR)
percentage. This conflicts with the Parameterisation subsection and Table 1, where CDR are given as
portions. To maintain consistency, one set should be modified so reporting styles match.

e 10 (Model comparison, opening sentence): The passage “DIC assess different models in terms of
ir trade-off between goodness of fit and model parsimony” would be better placed at the point DIC is
oduced in the methods. Please alter the positioning of this sentence.
e 13 (Analysis of covariance of fitted model parameters posterior probability distributions): This
agraph retains the notation <U+0001D6FD>1 , <U+0001D6FD>2 , <U+0001D6FD>3 . Please amend to <U+0001D6FD>11 , <U+0001D6FD>22 , <U+0001D6FD>33 for notation to agree with
re 4.
e 13 (Analysis of covariance of fitted model parameters posterior probability distributions): It is
ed in the Parameter estimation subsection of the results that the focus of the rest of the results
ion is on Model C. I assume this carries over all subsequent subsections in the results too. To erase
doubt, consider reiterating that Model C is being studied at the beginning of the covariance
ection, with a potential rephrasing to “We further assessed the behaviour of Model C by
mining…”
e 13 (simulation subsection): Within the newly added text, CDR are given as percentages. For
sistency with the CDR description outlined in the methods (Parameterisation subsection), either alter
roportions or amend the CDRs stated in the methods to percentages.

Page 5 (Parameter notation in Model D): The explanation surrounding Figure 1 has
vastly improved. To further simplify notation, I would look to have all parameters
surrounding connectivity use notation involving <U+0001D70C>. This was the intention of my

Page 6 (Force of Infection equation): Below the equation, it is stated that <U+0001D43C><U+0001D457> refers to
number of infectious TB cases (in spatial group <U+0001D457>). State <U+0001D43C> is also stated to denote
individuals with active TB, although only a fraction of them are infectious (if I have
understood correctly?). To avoid confusion, I recommend restating the definition
of <U+0001D43C><U+0001D457> as being the number of individuals with active TB in spatial group <U+0001D457>, and then
including the fraction of infection cases term within the force of infection equation
(see next comment).
Authors response: We thank the reviewer for noticing that. We have restated the
phrase below the force of infection equation in page 6 as
“Ij and Nj refer to the number of individuals with active TB and total population in
spatial group j respectively”.
We have also included the fraction of infectious cases(<U+03D5>) term into the force of
infection equation and made similar changes to figure 2.
Pages 7-8 (System of ODEs): The fraction of infection cases term (<U+0001D711>) is omitted from
the equations. Either add to each individual equation where required, or place into
the force of infection term. If adding to the force of infection term, please also
amend Figure 2 to reflect such a change.
Authors response: To simplify notations in the system of ODE, we have now
included the fraction of infection cases term (<U+0001D711>) into the force of infection
equation. Please see our response to the previous comment.
Page 8 (System of ODEs): When stating the use of Runge-Kutta algorithm, add that
the package that was used and the software to perform the numerical calculations
were ode45 and Matlab, respectively.
Authors response: We have now incorporated the suggested comments. The
revision now reads (please see beneath system of ODEs)
The numerical solutions were obtained using ode45 in Matlab 2015b.
Page 9 (Simulation of the impact of interventions, 2nd line): Thanks to the authors
for adding this detail to the methods. My understanding is this simulation work was
done with the best fitting model, and so would add “we first ran the best fitting
model” in place of “we first ran the model”.
Authors response: suggested changes are undertaken. The section (Page 9
(Simulation of the impact of interventions, 2nd line)) now reads
“……we first ran the best candidate model to equilibrium….”
Page 9 (Simulation of the impact of interventions): The added text states the case
detection rate (CDR) as a percentage. This conflicts with the Parameterisation
subsection and Table 1, where CDR are given as proportions. To maintain
consistency, one set should be modified so reporting styles match.
Authors response: To maintain consistency, we have reverted case detection rate
(CDR) expressed as proportion in the parameterisation subsection (lines 2-3) and
Table 1 back to percentages.

Page 10 (Model comparison, opening sentence): The passage “DIC assess different
models in terms of their trade-off between goodness of fit and model parsimony”
would be better placed at the point DIC is introduced in the methods. Please alter
the positioning of this sentence.
Authors response: We have now moved the opening sentence into the methods
section (Model fitting subsection, paragraph 2, line 18).
Page 13 (Analysis of covariance of fitted model parameters posterior probability
distributions): This paragraph retains the notation <U+0001D6FD>1, <U+0001D6FD>2, <U+0001D6FD>3. Please amend to <U+0001D6FD>11,
<U+0001D6FD>22,33 for notation to agree with Figure 4.
Authors response: we have amended as suggested so that the notation is
consistent throughout the document
Page 13 (Analysis of covariance of fitted model parameters posterior probability
distributions): It is stated in the Parameter estimation subsection of the results that
the focus of the rest of the results section is on Model C. I assume this carries over
all subsequent subsections in the results too. To erase any doubt, consider
reiterating that Model C is being studied at the beginning of the covariance
subsection, with a potential rephrasing to “We further assessed the behaviour of
Model C by examining…”
Authors response: We have now rephrased the beginning of this subsection as
suggested.
Page 13 (simulation subsection): Within the newly added text, CDR are given as
percentages. For consistency with the CDR description outlined in the methods
(Parameterisation subsection), either alter to proportions or amend the CDRs stated
in the methods to percentages.
Authors response: We have reverted case detection proportions in the
parameterisation subsection into percentages such that case detection in whole
document is now expressed as percentages.
