Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The authors have raised an interesting research question by analysing face identification
performance for people with good vs. poor sleep. Besides the research question being interesting
in general, I have found some particular points which definitely should be addressed before
thinking about publication in Royal Society Open Science.
I have enlisted all my major and minor points in the following.
Major points
1) Generally: I know that the GFMT claims to be free of a memory component, I am not
convinced that anything linked with perception can ever work without such a component. What
kind of perceptual understanding is it to assume that memory does not play a role, even if it is
just about simultaneous face MATCHING?
2) To state anything on “pure perception” means to have a good control condition at least;
such a control condition would rely strongly on memory processing, but the authors seem to
have tested their subjects just with a matching test for which they claim no memory was needed.
3) Introduction: some recent articles are obviously missing here, especially about sleep and
face adaptation and sleep and general matching performance
4) Which kind of sleep phases have been affected by the insomnia condition would be most
important to infer anything specific from the given effects.
5) What other factor have been affected by insomnia? In fact the current design leaves open
a lot of questions, because we do not know how the experimental group behaved and performed
before having got the insomnia problems. Here, experimental treatment of sleep quality and
quantity would have been much more appealing if it is really about poor or restricted sleep and
its impact on face matching performance.
6) Sleeping duration and sleeping habits are very much dependent on age factors; in the
current sample a very wide range of ages was realized (16 to 74! Years). First of all, how was the
age factor matched across conditions and second, how impacted the age any dependent
measures?
Minor points
1) Please add the unit “years” to age descriptions.
2) Please format statistical parameters according to the journal guidelines, I guess
formatting them in italics (e.g. p values are sometimes, but not always formatted in italics).
3) Please add effect sizes to ALL inference tests.
4) Title/Abstract: please make clear that we speak of insomnia not poor sleep or
experimentally induced poor sleep!
5) The definition of “sleep restricted” participants was 7plus hours; this sounds to be a very
long, or at least sufficient, sleeping duration actually.
6) Please add copyright notes to original material (Figure 1).

Performs two studies looking at how lack of sleep affects ability to match faces, and confidence in
that ability. Not good news.
I have only a few comments:
sleep restricted participants (>7 hours per night) – do you mean <7?
Extra word: sleep patterns prior in the three days prior to testing
Cohen’s d = 0.738 – why three digits?
I can’t see a definition of your sleep efficiency measure
Discussion: Moreover, insomnia participants were more confident in errors – only in expt 1.
“Given the prevalence of short sleep in professionals responsible for performing these tasks” –
evidence for this, as opposed to general shift work effects reported above?
Is it at least possible that there is something else about people who don't sleep well that causes
them to be poor at this task? You don't *know* that poor sleep is causal.

king about publication in Royal Society Open Science. !
ve enlisted all my major and minor points in the following. !
Generally: I know that the GFMT claims to be free of a memory component, I am not convinced
t anything linked with perception can ever work without such a component. What kind of
ceptual understanding is it to assume that memory does not play a role, even if it is just about
ultaneous face MATCHING? !
hor Response: This is certainly true. Indeed, by this standard all tasks we perform in our daily
s rely on memory to some extent. To clarify, we can’t (and don’t) claim that no memory is
olved in simultaneous matching. We do claim that our task involves far less memory than those
d in previous studies, for the simple reason that faces to be matched are presented
ultaneously, for as long as the subject chooses. Critically, in our task, subjects can return
tion to the target image after inspecting a comparison image, and repeat this process until a
ision in made. This clearly separates our work from previous studies that have examined the
ct of sleep on recognition memory tasks, and more closely models important face matching
ks performed in real world (e.g. by passport officers, police officers). !
have attempted to make this point clear in our revision, and have made changes to the
tract (‘do not involve memory’ > ‘do not rely on memory’), Introduction (page 4, lines 6-8) and
thod (page 6, lines 13-15). !
o state anything on “pure perception” means to have a good control condition at least; such a
trol condition would rely strongly on memory processing, but the authors seem to have tested
ir subjects just with a matching test for which they claim no memory was needed. !
hor Response: As above, we have clarified our position is not to say the task is entirely free of
mory demands (page 4, lines 6-8). A number of previous studies have shown that sleep impairs
mory for faces, using the more standard recognition–memory tasks which fill the literature (see
e 3, lines 6-8). The purpose of our study was to clarify whether impairments are also found in a
ceptually-based matching task. !
poor performance in sleep restricted groups in our study point to a perceptual basis for this
airment, and as the reviewer points out it will be important in future studies to examine the
tive contributions of perception and memory to these deficits. We now include this useful
gestion for future research at the end of the General Discussion (page 15, lines 7-13), and
e the reviewer can agree that such an experiment is beyond the scope of the present
estigation. !
troduction: some recent articles are obviously missing here, especially about sleep and face
ptation and sleep and general matching performance !
hor Response: We thank the reviewer for noticing the missing references. We have added a
rence to the face adaptation study by Ditye et al 2013 that measures the extent of adaptation
en followed by short/normal sleep (page 3, line 7), and also to a study showing rare evidence of
rer perceptual sensitivity following poor sleep (Rogé & Gabaude, 2009: page 3, line 21). !
hich kind of sleep phases have been affected by the insomnia condition would be most
ortant to infer anything specific from the given effects. !
ses and face identification. With regards to insomnia, there is evidence of both shortened SWS
non-REM sleep in this disorder (Baglioni et al., 2014), and so it is possible that group
erences in sleep architecture played a role in the effects reported. However, our data certainly
not entitle us to speculate as to the phases responsible for the impairment we report in this
er. We have revised the General Discussion to underline the need for further work to ascertain
chanisms responsible for this impairment (e.g. page 13, lines 19-24). !
What other factor have been affected by insomnia? In fact the current design leaves open a lot
uestions, because we do not know how the experimental group behaved and performed before
ing got the insomnia problems. Here, experimental treatment of sleep quality and quantity
uld have been much more appealing if it is really about poor or restricted sleep and its impact on
e matching performance. !
hor Response: As we now note in the General Discussion (page 13, lines 22-24), we agree that
erimentally restricting sleep would provide valuable evidence in determining the precise
chanism responsible for the impairment we observe in our study. We have made additional
nges to emphasize this (Title, Running Head, Abstract) and hope that the reviewer agrees an
erimental manipulation of sleep restriction is beyond the scope of the present study. !
evidence we do present suggests for the first time that deficits in face processing following
r sleep are not only caused by memory consolidation, but are instead very likely to have a
ceptual basis. Future work is necessary to understand the precise mechanisms, but we believe
t the present work makes a suitable contribution for future studies to build upon. !
Sleeping duration and sleeping habits are very much dependent on age factors; in the current
ple a very wide range of ages was realized (16 to 74! Years). First of all, how was the age
or matched across conditions and second, how impacted the age any dependent measures? !
hor Response: Differences between age composition of experimental groups were non-
nificant in both Experiment 1 [t(48) = 0.627; p = 0.533] and Experiment 2 [t(48) = 0.984; p =
28]. In addition, age was not correlated with any sleep measures or with face matching
uracy. (The latter finding is consistent with previous research: see Burton, White & McNeill,
0). !
