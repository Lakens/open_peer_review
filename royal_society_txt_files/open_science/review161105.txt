In this manuscript, authors describe the adhesion of functionally graded microfibers to rough
substrates. The revised version still has the following weaknesses that should be addressed in the
next version:
1. Relevant literature is missing: A very similar approach that the authors used to fabricate
their graded microfibers was already published in 2013 by Bae et al. (Adv. Healthcare Mater.
2013, 2, 109–113). Here, the tip of mushroom structures was modified in a similar process by
softer material to enhance the adhesion to rough substrate. What is new compared to the
previously published report? Furthermore, their exist recent reports on design parameters such
as modulus differences and the tip layer thickness that should be referred to as in the discussion
of the results (Balijepalli et al, J. Mech. Phys. Solids 99 (2017) 357–378; Fischer et al ACS Appl
Mater Interfaces. 2017, 9, 1036–1044). Based on that, the supposed optimization problem of the
layer thickness and height of the asperities should be discussed more in detail to strengthen the
author’s hypothesis.
There is a typo in the second line of the discussion: The author names of the reference 34 are
Minsky and Turner.
2. The argument that phospholipids might act as a soft layer, which support gecko’s
attachment to rough substrates is unclear to the reader. The difference between phospholipids
and the soft polyurethane used in the authors work is the phospholipids is a liquid and the PU is
a solid. Thus, the mechanics involved is completely different for the two cases. Either the authors
(experimentally) prove there statement or leave it out to avoid false impressions.

his manuscript, authors describe the adhesion of functionally graded microfibers to rough substrates.
revised version still has the following weaknesses that should be addressed in the next version:
Relevant literature is missing: A very similar approach that the authors used to fabricate their graded
rofibers was already published in 2013 by Bae et al. (Adv. Healthcare Mater. 2013, 2, 109–113). Here,
tip of mushroom structures was modified in a similar process by softer material to enhance the
esion to rough substrate. What is new compared to the previously published report?
ponse: The authors would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out this paper. It is now
d in the fabrication section, bottom of page 7: “Additionally, the fabrication of the
ctionally graded fibers is based on a technique demonstrated by Bae et al. [32] where they
d composite fibers to improve adhesion to skin.” Certainly the fabrication in our work is not
el. But looking at the effect of distal layer thicknesses of 3 -7 µm for fibers of ~40 µm
meter on rigid surfaces of varying roughness and comparing its performance to smooth
faces, we believe, is novel. The gains in adhesion by adding the soft tips in the mentioned
rk is quite marginal (~1.8 kPa with composite fibers compared to 1.3 kPa with monolithic
rs) and involves only one distal layer thickness of unknown thickness (although estimated to
~500 nm). It also does not give a sense for how the fiber parameters relate to the roughness
the modulus of skin. However, to reiterate our point, we missed this paper originally even
en we devised this work to begin with and are glad that it was pointed out by the reviewer.
urthermore, their exist recent reports on design parameters such as modulus differences and the tip
r thickness that should be referred to as in the discussion of the results (Balijepalli et al, J. Mech. Phys.
ds 99 (2017) 357–378; Fischer et al ACS Appl Mater Interfaces. 2017, 9, 1036–1044). Based on that, the
posed optimization problem of the layer thickness and height of the asperities should be discussed
e in detail to strengthen the author’s hypothesis.
ponse: These two papers were published after (or about the time) our manuscript was
mitted to the Royal Society Open Science and thus we had not had the chance to include
m in the manuscript. We now have addressed them in the manuscript. Bottom of page 13, in
cussion: “A similar effect was observed by Balijepalli et al. [36] when they performed
eriments with a 2-mm diameter stiffer stalk (E=2 MPa and E=350 MPa) covered with a
er distal layer (E=0.9 MPa). Both their numerical analysis and experiments showed that
oth surface adherence increases with decreasing thickness of the soft distal layer”. And
ting at the bottom of page 14 ending on page 15: “In a recent study, which is an extension of
], Fischer et al. [38] looked at the effect of distal layer thickness on pull-off force when the
posite fibers were tested on both a smooth (average peak-to-valley roughness Rz= 41 nm)
a rough surface (Rz= 2.174 µm). They found that pull-off force increased by 3 to 5 times
pared to conventional monolithic pillar structures made out of the soft distal layer material.
reover, specifically for pillars with a curved interface between the stalk and the soft distal
er, the pull-off force increased with decreasing distal layer thickness on both the smooth and
gh surfaces, and the dependence of pull-off force to distal layer thickness was very similar for
h surfaces. Note that due to the larger scale of the tested pillar, 20 µm was the thinnest soft
er included in their testing. This thickness is much larger than the peak-to-valley roughness of
74 µm of the rough surface tested and thus the rough surface results closely resemble the
oth surface results in their study. On the contrary, the layer thicknesses used in our work are
ser to the roughness values of the tested surfaces and thus the thickness of the distal layer has
ore prominent effect on pull-off force as shown in experimental results.”
here is a typo in the second line of the discussion: The author names of the reference 34 are Minsky
Turner.
ponse: The typo is corrected now.
The argument that phospholipids might act as a soft layer, which support gecko’s attachment to
gh substrates is unclear to the reader. The difference between phospholipids and the soft
yurethane used in the authors work is the phospholipids is a liquid and the PU is a solid. Thus, the
hanics involved is completely different for the two cases. Either the authors (experimentally) prove
e statement or leave it out to avoid false impressions.
ponse: This argument has been removed from the manuscript.
