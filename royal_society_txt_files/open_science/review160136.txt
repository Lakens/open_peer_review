Makowska and Weary report that groups of (5) rats raised post-weaning and living in an
‘enriched’, ‘semi-seminatural’ environment exhibit an age dependent decline in climbing and
upright standing. Burrowing did not change across the lifespan. They also compared lateral
stretching at the 13-month time point between standard and enriched rats.
This approach is novel and welcome, the Intro is particularly well written, and the findings are
interesting. I’ve some concerns that I think that the authors can address:
Lines 131-149 are somewhat confusing, especially relative to Lines 188-210. Shouldn’t the
different sampling methods be described (in the Methods) and reported on (in the Results). In
other words, what approaches were the sampling methods that were employed and then
excluded?
I found most of the Discussion highly speculative. In particular, Lines 340-341 refer to public
opinion rather then scientific approaches. Also, Lines 370-371 are high conjecture.
Why did the authors only measure lateral stretching in 13 month-old standard housed mice? This
is a gleaming eye sore in the methods, as this is the only behavior that could have been compared
longitudinally between standard-housed and enriched mice across all 3 developmental time
points.

In this article, the authors examined whether some of the rats' behavior (burrowing, climbing and
upright standing) changed with age in semi-naturalistic environments and whether rats' lateral
stretching as "compensatory behavior" differ between semi-naturalistic environment and
standard laboratory environment. In the results, they found that the frequency and duration of
burrowing did not vary with age, but those of the other behaviors decreased with age. In
addition, those of lateral stretching differ between semi-naturalistic environment and standard
laboratory environment.
I think this report will generate some impact on research of animal welfare. However, the
evidence the authors have shown is relatively weak for indicating their opinion on the
importance of environmental enrichment in laboratory rats.
1. I agree with the author’s opinion that more naturalistic, enriched environment
contributes to rats' welfare. However, which aspects of environmental condition actually
contribute to rats' welfare are unclear. More specifically, the authors did not show the direct
evidence of the relationship between environmental enrichment and the welfare. Although the
authors have shown that the frequency and duration of lateral stretching were much higher in
standard cages than semi-naturalistic cages, I have two question about that.
First, what made the difference between the environments is still unclear. The authors suggested
that the availability of upright-standing and mobility might be important to decrease lateral
stretching. If so, I recommend the authors show the correlation between frequencies of upright-
standing and mobility and frequency of lateral stretching.
Second, I think "lateral stretching" is an interesting index, but it is relatively vague as an index of
lowered welfare in rats. Is there any evidence that lateral stretching is closely related with a more
direct index of well-being such as stress or illness?
2. Authors insisted that burrowing is quite important to rats because frequency and
duration of burrowing stay constant despite other activities decrease with age. Authors tried to
explain the importance of burrowing mainly from the function of sheltering rats from threatening
stimuli and suggested the possibility that the burrowing itself have a reward value to rats. While
the explanation is quite interesting, the authors should show some more convincing evidence that
burrowing relates rats' welfare. For example, does prevention of burrowing induce a stressful
response in rats?
3. There are no statistical results of paired-comparison in each behavior. Please make clear
which pairs of age conditions were statistically different.

Reviewer: 1
Makowska and Weary report that groups of (5) rats raised post-weaning and living in an
‘enriched’, ‘semi-seminatural’ environment exhibit an age dependent decline in climbing
and upright standing. Burrowing did not change across the lifespan. They also compared
lateral stretching at the 13-month time point between standard and enriched rats.
This approach is novel and welcome, the Intro is particularly well written, and the
findings are interesting. I’ve some concerns that I think that the authors can address:
1. Lines 131-149 are somewhat confusing, especially relative to Lines 188-210. Shouldn’t the
different sampling methods be described (in the Methods) and reported on (in the
Results). In other words, what approaches were the sampling methods that were
employed and then excluded?
We have made several changes that we hope help clarify the methods. In the Methods
section, we now list and describe all the sampling methods that were tried on the 24-h data
(lines 159-162; all line numbers refer to the version with track changes). We also provide
more detail on the criteria used to select the final method for video analysis (lines 162-165).
In the Results section, we now describe which sampling methods satisfied our criteria, and
which were ultimately chosen (lines 213, 216-219).
I found most of the Discussion highly speculative. In particular, Lines 340-341 refer to
public opinion rather then scientific approaches. Also, Lines 370-371 are high conjecture.
We have revised our Discussion to minimize the amount of speculation, and where
speculation still exists we acknowledge this. Regarding burrowing, we discuss that our
results suggest that burrowing is particularly important to rats; we now follow this
statement with “Future studies could investigate this idea further, for example by
measuring the amount of work rats are willing to perform to gain access to a burrowing
substrate” (line 297-299). We also suggest that burrowing may lead to positive welfare; we
now follow this up with “Future studies investigating this idea are warranted” (line 336).
The role and importance of burrowing have not been previously scientifically studied. In the
absence of similar research, we have attempted to situate our findings within the broader
literature on rat behaviour and welfare. This discussion has led us to formulate new
hypotheses and avenues for future research that we hope readers will find of interest.
We have also made several changes to the section on the role of public opinion in driving
change in the way animals are housed (this section included lines 340-341). We removed
the sentence speculating about the public’s opinion on rat housing (formerly lines 345-347).
In addition, we have moved a revised version of this section from the Discussion to the
Introduction (lines 45-50), where it now serves to provide context for the importance of
investigating upright standing in laboratory rats.
With regards to lines 370-371 (“Laboratory rats reared in an environment that allowed
them to burrow, climb and stand upright performed these behaviours regularly throughout
the day and well into adulthood”), we have changed the word ‘regularly’ for ‘consistently’
to clarify that what we mean is that rats performed these behaviours throughout the day,
as opposed to, for example, only in the few hours after they woke up. This sentence
provides a summary of the results presented in Figures 2 and 3 (temporal distribution of
behaviours throughout a 24-h period, and presence of these behaviours in juvenile 3-mo
old rats, young adult 8-mo old rats, and middle-aged 13-mo old rats).
Why did the authors only measure lateral stretching in 13 month-old standard housed
mice? This is a gleaming eye sore in the methods, as this is the only behavior that could
have been compared longitudinally between standard-housed and enriched mice across
all 3 developmental time points.
As noted in the Discussion (lines 388-390), lateral stretching in standard-housed rats was
only scored in 13-mo old rats partly because video scoring was extremely time-consuming,
and partly because evidence from semi-naturalistic-housed rats suggested that levels of
stretching were relatively stable across time. We agree that a longitudinal comparison
between the two housing systems would have been interesting. We now remind readers
that this result reflects only one point in time: “At this one point in time – 13 months of age
– standard-housed rats stretched approximately eight times more often...” (lines 390-391).
We also call for future studies to perform comparisons at different ages: “Our measures of
lateral stretching were only performed in 13-month old rats, and more age-related data are
warranted.” (lines 415-416).

In this article, the authors examined whether some of the rats' behavior (burrowing,

I think this report will generate some impact on research of animal welfare. However, the

1. I agree with the author’s opinion that more naturalistic, enriched environment
contributes to rats' welfare. However, which aspects of environmental condition actually
contribute to rats' welfare are unclear. More specifically, the authors did not show the
direct evidence of the relationship between environmental enrichment and the welfare.
Although the authors have shown that the frequency and duration of lateral stretching
were much higher in standard cages than semi-naturalistic cages, I have two question
about that.
We apologize for the confusion regarding the aims of this study. Indeed, our aim was not to
assess rat welfare in the two housing systems, but to investigate whether laboratory rats
were motivated to perform certain natural behaviours that are not possible in standard
cages; if this was found to be the case, then future research could address the specific
welfare implications of allowing or denying rats these activities. To clarify this, we now
state that our investigations here are “a starting point” (line 63-64) to determining whether
the behaviours under investigation are important to rats. We have also modified the aims
statement in the Introduction to: “The goal of this study was to investigate whether
laboratory rats are motivated to burrow, climb and stand upright; if such evidence is found
here, then further research should address the specific welfare benefits of allowing, or
consequences of preventing, rats from engaging in each of these behaviours. Thus, the first
aim of this study was to describe the daily frequency, total duration and distribution
throughout the day of burrowing (excavation of burrows), climbing and upright standing in
laboratory rats reared in semi-naturalistic cages” (lines 95-101). Furthermore, we have also
modified the Conclusion to read: “These findings suggest that standard laboratory cages
interfere with important natural behaviours, and this likely compromises rat welfare. On
this basis, we suggest that research addressing the direct consequences of preventing or
allowing these behaviours is warranted” (lines 436-437).
First, what made the difference between the environments is still unclear. The authors
suggested that the availability of upright-standing and mobility might be important to
decrease lateral stretching. If so, I recommend the authors show the correlation between
frequencies of upright-standing and mobility and frequency of lateral stretching.
We have now revised the text surrounding lateral stretching, in the hopes of clarifying the
logical development of our aims and thoughts around this measure. Please see our
response to the next query below.
We do not have a direct measure of ‘mobility’ and therefore cannot provide correlations.
However, we believe that the revised text now clarifies this issue.
Second, I think "lateral stretching" is an interesting index, but it is relatively vague as an
index of lowered welfare in rats. Is there any evidence that lateral stretching is closely
related with a more direct index of well-being such as stress or illness?
As clarified in our response to the first part of comment 1, we did not wish to imply that
lateral stretching (or any other behaviour investigated in this paper) was used as an index
of welfare. We have revised our Introduction and aims statement to address this (please
see response to the first part of comment 1).
In addition, we re-organized and rephrased our introduction of, and discussions around, the
topic of lateral stretching. These had originally been written in a way so as to simplify the
manuscript, but we realize now that they actually introduced some confusion to the logic of
the paper. Specifically, we have re-written lines 108-114 in the Introduction to read “Rats
stretch in the vertical position while standing upright, and also in the lateral position while
remaining parallel to the ground. Because standard-housed rats are unable to stretch in the
upright position, we hypothesized that they would perform more lateral stretches than
their semi-naturalistic-housed counterparts to compensate for the inability to stretch
vertically. Therefore, the second aim of this study was to record the frequency of lateral
stretching in 13-month old laboratory rats reared in standard versus semi-naturalistic
cages.”
The Discussion has been revised to read the following: “This result supports our hypothesis
that standard-housed rats performed more lateral stretches to compensate for the inability
to stretch upright. However, rats in the semi-naturalistic condition stretched upright about
7-15 times per day (10-20% of the 73 bouts of upright standing in 13-month old rats), so the
combined amount of lateral and upright stretching in the semi-naturalistic cages (about 13-
21 vs. 53 in the standard cages) is still far below the amount of lateral stretching observed
in the standard cages, suggesting that compensation for inability to stretch upright is not
the only motivation driving high rates of lateral stretching. The scientific literature on
stretching contends that stretching is a peri-somnolent phenomenon (occurring before or
after sleep) but is also expressed in response to stiffness caused by extended periods of
immobility, positional stress, and sub-optimal movements [42,63]. Rats housed in standard
laboratory cages are sedentary [64], having about 0.1 m2 floor space for moving around. In
the semi-naturalistic cages, rats had 1.7 m2 floor space between the different levels; these
rats also burrowed and climbed. We suggest that the much higher frequency of lateral
stretching in standard-housed rats indicates that standard-housed rats were also using this
behaviour to compensate for their generally low levels of mobility.” (lines 394-415).
We also revised the Abstract to reflect these changes (lines 19-20 and 25-26).
2. Authors insisted that burrowing is quite important to rats because frequency and
duration of burrowing stay constant despite other activities decrease with age. Authors
tried to explain the importance of burrowing mainly from the function of sheltering rats
from threatening stimuli and suggested the possibility that the burrowing itself have a
reward value to rats. While the explanation is quite interesting, the authors should show
some more convincing evidence that burrowing relates rats' welfare. For example, does
prevention of burrowing induce a stressful response in rats?
As expressed in our response to comment 1, we have now revised our Introduction and
aims statement to clarify that our goal was not to assess rat welfare (or use any of the
behaviours tested here as direct indices of welfare), but to determine rats’ propensity to
engage in these behaviours as a starting point to investigating whether rats are motivated
to perform these behaviours. We also now clarify that future studies should test the
specific welfare consequences of allowing or denying rats these activities (please see
response to comment 1).
In addition, with regards to burrowing specifically, we have broken up the first paragraph of
the Discussion and now follow-up our statement about the possible importance of
burrowing with the following sentence “Future studies could investigate this idea further,
for example by measuring the amount of work rats are willing to perform to gain access to
a burrowing substrate” (lines 297-299).
Finally, we have also added a section at the end of the Discussion describing how another
published study using these rats, when they were older, showed that standard-housed rats
were experiencing poorer welfare compared to rats from the semi-naturalistic condition:
“There is evidence that rats reared in the semi-naturalistic environment had better welfare
than rats reared in the standard cages [65]. When these rats were 19 months old, they
were tested in an anticipatory behaviour test that assessed differences in reward sensitivity
between animals reared in the two housing conditions; reward sensitivity is related to an
individual’s subjective evaluations of his or her internal state [66–68]. Results from this
study suggested that standard-housed rats were experiencing poorer welfare compared to
the semi-naturalistic-housed rats. There were several differences between the two housing
conditions; for example, rats in the semi-naturalistic environment were able to display a
larger behavioural repertoire, including burrowing, climbing and upright standing; they
were housed in a larger social group; and they had regular access to healthy treats. Which
of these factors, or combination of factors, contributed to differences in welfare remains to
be tested.” (lines 417-426).
3. There are no statistical results of paired-comparison in each behavior. Please make clear
which pairs of age conditions were statistically different.
We did not perform pair-wise age comparisons, because we were not specifically interested
in differences between specific ages, but in the general trend over time. With this goal in
mind, we performed a mixed model analysis which tested whether there was an overall
difference between the three time points. To help clarify this, we made two changes to the
Methods – Statistical Analysis subsection: firstly, we now write “...the overall effect of age
on the frequency and duration of each behaviour was calculated using a mixed model” (line
204); secondly, we added the following sentence: “Comparisons between individual pairs of
age conditions were not performed, because we were not specifically interested in
differences between particular ages” (lines 206-208). However, if the Reviewer is
specifically interested in differences between pairs of age conditions, we can provide these.
4. p.11 line 205. Please correct “Table 2” to “Table 3”
Done.
5. p.12 line 231. I could not find “Table 3”. Does this mean “Table 4”?
Yes, thank you for catching this. We modified to Table 4.
6. Please show the effect size in each statistical result.
The magnitude of the effects is illustrated in Figure 2. We are concerned that adding means
and SE in the text (in such a way that would also allow readers to estimate the effect size in
the text) would be redundant.
7. p.14 line 285. The authors wrote that “rats in this study also constructed new tunnels
even when several others were already present.” However, they did not show any
objective data, so that I could not evaluate this point. Please show relevant data, if the
author has it. Otherwise, please eliminate the description.
We have now eliminated this sentence from the Discussion.
8. p.29 figure 3. The fineness and the range of the scales of the vertical line lack consistency
