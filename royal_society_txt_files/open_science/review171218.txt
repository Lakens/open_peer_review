I know this is to be an "objective review", but I do want to say that this is a fascinating study and
a basic approach taken from conservation biology that may well contribute to the field of
linguistics in novel ways. Hats off to the authors for taking this on.
That said, I am a bit concerned that the arbitrariness of the GE scoring might detract from its
impact. I urge the authors to include and highlight alternative measures, including ranking
languages at the high end of the extinction risk category by ED. The EDGE algorithm is wholly
arbitrary and is also on the being scuppered by the EDGE programme itself, meaning that nailing
your colours to that particular mast may not be as useful as charting out a way to flexibly
incorporate linguistic isolation into prioritization schemes based on p(extinction).
I have made many comments on the manuscript using "annotate-add note" in Preview. Purple
ones are the more serious, while yellow ones are suggestions (like noting that ED and GE are
actually positively correlated in this dataset) and queries. All the comments are aimed at making
the manuscript more intelligible and to increase impact (the tree production section is not good at
all: the authors took a complicated but seemingly reasonable approach to a hard problem, but
that does give one a pass from describing it properly). (Appendix A)
With regards to the SM:
1. I think a figure outlining the algorithm for adding in the missing species to supplement the 350
spp Gray tree for calculation of the ED scores would be helpful: I cannot visualize exactly where
the "absent clades" are placed on the Gray tree. It seems they are added to a node, not along an
edge. Is this true? Is it ever the case that the topology of the Gray tree is not consistent with the
topology from the Ethnologue taxonomy – if so, steps 3-5 might not be smooth. For step 2, you
mean "language or group of languages in the Gray tree..", correct?
"We measured the betterment of a reconstruction method by the proportion of uncertainty it
removes from the reduced tree, so that R2 coefficients of 0.5 and 0.9 are improved by 50% if the
method brings them to 0.75 and 0.95 respectively."
--Do you mean by 5%? I do not see how these improvements can be 50%.
2. Re: Figure 1 and Figure 2. I think you have redundant terms for trees here connecting these
two figures to each other and to the text: "reduced", "complete", "original", "reconstructed" and
"true." I believe there are only three trees from which ED scores are measured – the reduced tree,
the complete reconstructed tree, and the complete true tree. The correlation of the complete
reconstructed ED scores and the complete true tree scores (of the ED scores for the reduced set of
species in each case) is always higher than the correlation between the scores of the same tips
taken from reduced tree and the complete true tree. (I would hope so!). Please check, and see if
you cannot tighten up the description of what you did here. Figure 1 is particularly poor.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
I reviewed an earlier version of this paper for another journal. Looking at the comments from the
previous reviews (mine and others), I see that many points have been taken into account. This has
considerably strengthened the paper, in my view.
The biggest problem is to do with the relationship between missing taxa and their impact on the
EDGE score. To see why this is a problem, consider why a language might be missing - for large
and relatively complete phylogenies, most likely, it's because data were not readily available. The
controlling for incomplete trees through data partitioning and subsetting assumes that the full
sample is representative of the world. But that's not true here, because sampling omission is in
large part based on access to materials, which is a function of number of speakers and implies an
urgency of documentation (if speakers are still alive). Related to this, how does this measure take
phylogenetic uncertainty into account?
The other comment is to do with the endangerment scale. In the previous review, I suggested the
use of data from endangeredlanguages.com, which included information on documentation as
well as speaker numbers. This doesn't seem to have been addressed, and it's an important point.
Given that one of the main reasons for doing these calculations is to figure out which languages
to prioritize in documentation, building in what linguistic resources are already available seems a
logical step.
Finally, there are some very odd choices for referencing. For example, reference 24 (on dialects) is
about artificial grammars. Reference 21 is a book chapter, not an article. References are poorly
formatted, with stray {} and missing capitalization. Reference 46 is an odd choice (a minor paper
about a single French word, which draws some totally incorrect conclusions about syntactic
change, which are in contradiction to this paper's conclusions) given the vast literature on
syntactic change and internal causation.

Most of the issues I raised have been dealt with well - the explanation of how ED scores were
created using the new figure is much clearer, though a few additional clarifications in the text are
necessary (I know how easy it is to forget that readers do not actually know what you have
done...). I have made new comments using the "add note" tool (blue ones being more important).
I am not comfortable with the strong statements linking ED to ecosystem functioning in the
abstract and introduction, but I do not think it is necessary to do this to motivate the linguistic
study - your reasons for valuing isolated languages stand on their own. You must also give

priority (or at the very least co-priority) to Redding (2003) for the actual ED metric (Fair
Proportion) used by Isaac et al. (2007). This was not done in this version. (Appendix C)

28 Languages are being lost at rates exceeding the
29 global loss of biodiversity. With the extinction of
30 a species, we lose vital ecosystem services and
31
functions. With the extinction of a language we
32
lose irreplaceable dimensions of culture, and insight
33
it provides on human history and the evolution
34
of linguistic diversity. When setting conservation
35
goals, biologists give higher priority to species
36
likely to go extinct. Recent methods now integrate
37
information on species evolutionary relationships
38
39 to prioritise the conservation of those with few
40 close relatives. Advances in the construction of
41 language trees allow these methods to develop
42 language preservation priorities that minimize loss of
43 linguistic diversity. The EDGE (Evolutionarily Distinct
44 and Globally Endangered) metric, increasingly used
45 in conservation biology, accounts for a species’
46 originality (evolutionary distinctiveness — ED) and
47 its likelihood of extinction (global endangerment —
48 GE). Here, we use this method to inform priorities for
49 language preservation by generating rankings for 350
50 Austronesian languages. Kavalan, Tanibili, Waropen,
51 and Sengseng obtained the highest EDGE scores,
52 while Xârâcùù, Nengone, and Palauan are among
53 the most linguistically distinct, but are not currently
54 threatened. We further provide a way of dealing with
55 incomplete trees, a common issue for both species and
56 language trees.

to a special understanding of native environments. Their disappearance is a loss to humanity,
16
scholarship, and science [7]. Prehistorians study languages to trace back population movements
..............................................................
17
[8,9] and anthropologists use language trees to test hypothesis of cultural evolution [10,11].
18
Linguists use the variety of parlances to understand language as a human phenomenon; every
19
single tongue gives them additional insight [7]. Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), often
20
21 used in biodiversity conservation efforts [12–15], is imperilled if languages are lost [16,17].
22 In conservation biology, there have been efforts to prioritise species based on their evolutionary
23 distinctiveness with the idea that highly distinct species might have unique traits that contribute
24 to biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems [18,19]. For example, species with many close
25 relatives might provide few unique ecosystem services. Conversely, species with few relatives are
26 usually the most functionally original and may provide irreplaceable services [4,20]. Likewise in
27 linguistics, the more isolated a language in its family tree, the more unique information it contains
28 and ultimately contributes to linguistic diversity. Prioritizing the documentation of threatened
29 and isolated languages is a key goal in linguistics [6]. Recently developed methods for quantifying
30 similarity among languages [21] offer new opportunities to inform these prioritizations.
31 In biology, phylogenetic trees (”trees of life”) depict species ancestor-to-descendant
32 relationships. Two populations of a single species will evolve into two species when gene flow
33 is interrupted, often by geographic isolation [22]. One can consider speciation complete when
34 two populations can no longer interbreed [23]. Speciation is depicted in the tree by the splitting of
35 branches. Likewise, though a simplification, dialects become languages when the speakers of one
36 dialect can no longer understand speakers of the other [24]. Like new species, diverged dialects
37 are splits in a language tree.
38 We can quantify a species’ evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) by measuring how isolated it is
39 on a phylogenetic tree. Species isolated in the tree are said to be evolutionarily distinct. Similarly,
40 we can quantify linguistic distinctiveness from language trees. Once a set of features is selected
41 and a tree built from them, distinctiveness scores can be calculated and used as empirical and
42 objective estimates of uniqueness among languages. There are many distinctiveness metrics [25],
43 but all aim to favour species with considerable unique evolutionary history, species with few close
44 relatives and the last of long evolutionary lines.
45 Early distinctiveness metrics counted only the number of splits in a species’ ancestry, giving
46 higher scores to fewer splits [4,26]. Such metrics are highly sensitive to missing data (absent splits
47 in the tree). More recent measures treat the lengths of tree branches as units of distinctiveness,
48 usually counted in millions of years. In these cases, a species’ distinctiveness is equal to the length
49 of its branch plus a fraction of that of its ancestors. Like money that people inherit from their
50 mother, fewer siblings mean higher scores. If the mother herself had few siblings, she inherited
51 more from her parents and will have more to leave to her children. Further, with a constant salary,
52 the longer she lived, the more money she had and the more she can leave them. Following Isaac et
53
al. (2007) [27], we used a metric of ED in which ancestral distinctiveness is divided evenly among
54
all living descendants.
55
Isaac et al. (2007) [27] determined the ED from a near complete species-level phylogenetic tree
56
for mammals with branch lengths proportional to time. Implicit within their calculation is an
57
assumption that species differentiate at a constant rate through time, i.e. that branch lengths
58
measured in evolutionary time capture the expected differences between species. ED being a

7 weighted sum of branch lengths, also represents time in millions of species-years. The platypus 3
8 for example has an ED of about 97.6 million years, the greatest ED in the mammal phylogeny.
9 The assumption of constant divergence through time, however, does not hold up well for
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
10 languages. Since Icelandic and Norwegian diverged from Old Norse one thousand years ago,
11 the basic vocabulary of Norwegian has changed five times faster than that of Icelandic [28]. This
12 is not an isolated example — time is thus only a poor estimator of linguistic distinctiveness. A
13 language’s ED is therefore better computed from a language tree whose branch lengths convey
14 distinctiveness directly. Here, we use a tree based on the proportion of ancestral words substituted
15 for newer words in a language’s basic vocabulary.
16 To prioritise conservation efforts so as to minimise the expected loss of diversity,
distinctiveness can be weighted by the probability of extinction. To estimate this probability,
..............................................................
17
18 Isaac et al. (2007) [27] used the endangerment levels of the IUCN red list [29], an objective
19 qualitative scale of species extinction risk. Taking a species’ evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) and
20 global endangerment (GE) as proxies for its contribution to diversity and probability of extinction,
21 a species’ EDGE score is calculated as follows:
22
23 EDGE = ln(1 + ED) + GE · ln(2) (1.1)
24
At least three endangerment scales analogous to the IUCN Red List have been designed for
25
languages: a list by conservation biologist William Sutherland [5], UNESCO’s atlas of the world’s
26
27 languages in danger [30], and the EGIDS scale published by the Ethnologue, an online database of
28 7000 languages [31]. Given a detailed language phylogeny, it is hence possible to apply techniques
29 from conservation biology to language preservation.
30 Here we illustrate the EDGE approach using a tree of several hundred Austronesian languages
31 built on differences in basic vocabulary (210 words), typically stable through time and resistant to
32 borrowing from other languages. This tree represents one of the largest language families in the
33 world, likely originating from Taiwan 4000-6000 years ago and then rapidly expanding through
34 islands of the Pacific [32]. The exercise of ranking languages with the EDGE metric can identify
35 languages that are both distinct and threatened, which might be considered important targets
36 for documentation and preservation, if not done already. Although we analyse only a subset of
37 Austronesian language diversity, we present a method that corrects for limited sampling, and
38 show that our results are surprisingly robust to missing languages in the phylogeny.
39
40
41 2. Methods
42
43 (a) Data
44
We applied the EDGE metric [27] to a 350-language Austronesian family tree reduced from a 400-
45
language tree by Gray et al. (2009) [33], itself based on lexical data from Greenhill et al. (2008)
46
[53] and corrected for missing languages (see below). The lexical data from these 400 languages
47
48 consists of 210 basic words, thought to be stable over time and resistant to borrowing. Branch
49 lengths in the tree represent the median number of cognate changes undergone on that branch
50 across trees sampled from a Bayesian posterior distribution. Importantly, the analysis makes no
51 assumption that words change at a constant rate over time.
52 The 400 original languages were selected based on data availability and to provide “a
53 representative sample of each recognised Austronesian subgroup” [33]. From this set we
54 removed 16 languages that were extinct, not Austronesian, or without an ISO 639-3 code from
55 the International Organization for Standardization [54]. We further removed 34 Austronesian
56 dialects that shared an ISO 639-3 code with another language in the tree, always keeping
57 the dialect with the greatest ED. Our final tree represents 350 (27.8%) of the 1249 ISO 639-3
58 Austronesian languages. Conclusions drawn here apply only to these 350 languages. The missing
59 907 Austronesian languages are expected to impact the ED of those 350 languages, but only
60 mildly, as we will illustrate.

7 To measure the probability of extinction, we converted the 10-point EGIDS scale of language 4
8 endangerment into a Global Endangerment index (GE, Table 1). GE parallels the IUCN Red
9 List [29], in which increases of one level double the probability of extinction. (Details and
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
10 conversion scheme in SM Table 1.) We would expect other endangerment scales to yield
11 somewhat different EDGE scores. The EGIDS, however, is the only complete scale for the
12 languages in our sample.
13
14 (b) Impact of the partial phylogeny
15
16 To assess the effect of missing languages on the ED scores, we performed the following sensitivity
analyses. First, we extracted sub-trees from the original 350-language tree by randomly pruning
..............................................................
17
18 a given number of languages, and compared the language ED estimated on the sub-trees with
19 those from the original 350-language Austronesian tree. We then computed the R2 between the
20 ED measures, and repeated the procedure 100 times for each number of tips removed (Figure 2).
21 We found that ED scores in trees with a reduced number of languages were similar to those of the
22 original tree (Figure 2), even when one removes 72.3% (253 of the 350) languages, which reflects
23 the sampling of the Gray et al. (2009) [33] tree relative to the total 1249 Austronesian languages.
24 In this case, the ED of the 97-language tree and that of the original 350-language tree correlated to
25 an average R2 of 0.78, and to 0.75 ± 0.14, 99% of the time (intersecting lines, Figure 2).
26
27 (c) Partial phylogeny correction
28
29 The phylogenetic tree we used for this analysis is a composite 1249-language tree, reconstructed
30 from Ethnologue data plus the 350-language tree by Gray et al (details in SM). This tree allows
31 computing the ED of the 350 original languages more accurately, but does not provide reliable
32 estimates of ED for the remaining 907 Austronesian languages. We thus focus our analysis only
33 on the 350 languages included in Gray et al.
34
35 (d) Calculating the EDGE
36
37 Since branch lengths in the language tree were not proportional to time (as is often the case with
38 species trees), an absolute ED score is difficult to interpret. We therefore chose to use the relative
39 ED (EDR ), computed by dividing all ED scores by the average ED score. By construction, EDR
40 scores have a mean of 1, and a language with an EDR of 2 is twice as distinct as the average
41 language.
42 The weightings of ED and GE in the original EDGE metric are relatively arbitrary [55]. To give
43 importance to both evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) and endangerment (GE), we adapted the
44 EDGE metric given in equation 1.1 by dividing the weight of the GE by 4, its maximum value:
45
1
46 EDGE = ln(1 + EDR ) + · GE · ln(2) (2.1)
4
47
Had we stuck to the original definition of the EDGE, rankings would have been dominated by
48
49 endangerment scores with little regard to distinctiveness (see Pearse et al. 2015 [56] for a similar
50 approach).
51 We ran all analyses with the R statistical language [57] with the following libraries: we used the
52 ade4 [58], ape [59], and phytools [60] R packages to manipulate phylogenetic trees, picante [61] to
53 compute ED, phangorn [62] and geiger [63] to idenfity ancestral nodes, and plots were generated
54 using ggplot2 [64].
55
56 3. Results
57
58 We estimated EDGE using a novel method that allowed us to account for all 1249 Austronesian
59 languages in our ED scores by complementing the Gray et al. (2009) [33] tree with language
60 classification data from the Ethnologue (full details on tree reconstruction provided in SM).

7 Although we can only calculate EGDE for languages included in the Gray et al. tree where we 5
8 have meaningful branch lengths, ignoring missing langugages will typically cause us to over-
9 estimate ED. We assessed the effect of missingness and find an expected correlation of R2 ˜ 0.82
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
10 (within 0.78 ± 0.14, with 99% probability) between the ED of the reconstructed 1249-language tree
11 and that of the (hypothetical) true 1249-language tree (details provided in SM).
12 We calculated relative ED (EDR ) for each language by dividing all ED scores by the average
13 ED score. EDR scores are approximately log-normally distributed (listed in SI, table 3), ranging
14 from that of Indonesian (0.15) to those of Kavalan (3.43) and Xârâcùù (3.75). EDR scores have
15 a geometric mean of 0.84 and a median of 0.86. Of the 350 languages for which we can measure
16 ED, 113 (32%) are threatened (GE = 2), representing 34% of the total measurable Austronesian ED.
EDGE scores are approximately normally distributed (Figure 1), and range from 0.14 (Indonesian)
..............................................................
17
18 to 2.18 (Kavalan, Table 2), with a mean of 0.86 and a standard deviation of 0.35.
19 Kavalan is 3.73 standard deviations above the EDGE score mean. This is remarkably high in a
20 sample size of 350, expected by chance only once in every 5300 languages. By contrast the second
21 and third highest EDGE languages are 2.86 and 2.63 standard deviations above the mean, the kind
22 of deviation expected in one of 240 and 120 languages respectively.
23 Neither EDR nor EDGE are randomly distributed geographically — the Philippines are a
24 striking example. Of the 350 languages in our tree, 53 are Filipino. In the Philippines, 48 languages
25 (91%) have EDR below average, and 51 languages (96%) are in vigorous use (GE = 1). The
26 Philippine language with the highest EDR , Inabaknon, only ranks 80 out of 350, which is
27 significantly lower than expected by chance (p < 10-6 , see SI). Similarly, the Philippine language
28 with the highest EDGE, Central Tagbanwa, ranks 90 out of 350, again significantly lower than
29 expected by chance (p < 10-7 ).
30 All five French Polynesian languages except Tahitian are endangered, which makes French
31 Polynesia the country with the highest average GE among those countries with more than two
32 languages (avg. GE = 2.41, n = 5). Formosan languages, spoken by indigenous peoples of Taiwan,
33 have the second-highest average GE (1.91, n = 14). French Polynesian languages, however, have
34 a much lower average EDR (0.45) than Formosan languages (1.83); losing one average Formosan
35 language would reduce the total Austronesian ED more than losing all four endangered French
36 Polynesian languages. Only New Caledonian languages have higher average EDR (1.98) than
37 Formosan languages, but New Caledonian languages are not as threatened (avg. GE = 1.25,
38 n = 7). High ED and GE make Formosan languages the highest EDGE scoring on average (avg.
39
EDGE = 1.35), followed by New Caledonia (1.22).
40
41
42 4. Discussion
43
In linguistics, as in conservation biology, limited resources in conjunction with rapid rates of
44
extinction mean that efforts need to be optimised to maximise the preservation of diversity. Here
45
we suggest efforts to preserve linguistic diversity could benefit by borrowing from approaches
46
used in conservation biology that weight species by their evolutionary distinctiveness and global
47
48 endangerment (EDGE). Applying the EDGE metric to languages requires only an endangerment
49 score for each language, and a language tree whose branches reflect linguistic distinctiveness,
50 data that are already available for many languages.
51 We illustrate the linguistic EDGE on a 350-language Austronesian family tree. Our results
52 reveal striking disparities in the evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) among languages, here
53 reflecting a measure of lexical contribution to linguistic diversity. For example, the language
54 with the highest ED, Xârâcùù, contributes 25 times more than the language that contributes least.
55 The six highest ranking EDGE languages (Table 2) were Kavalan (EDR = 3.43, GE = 4), Tanibili
56 (EDR = 2.26, GE = 4), Waropen (EDR = 2.56, GE = 3), Sengseng (EDR = 3.20, GE = 2), Magori
57 (EDR = 1.92, GE = 4), and Xârâcùù (EDR = 3.75, GE = 1).
58 Kavalan is an exceptionally distinct yet nearly extinct language indigenous to Northeastern
59 Taiwan. In 2000, it had 24 speakers [31] and an ethnic population of 1000 living mostly in Eastern
60 Taiwan [34]. It is spoken in only one village, Sinshe, chiefly by elderly speakers. There have
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos

5
6
7 been recent efforts to revive it in schools, but without proper funding the village could not train 6
8 language teachers [35]. Tanibili is one of three highly endangered languages of Utupua in Temotu
9 Province, Solomon Islands, none of which have more than a few hundred speakers and are almost
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
10 completely undocumented [36]. Waropen and Sengseng are languages of New Guinea spoken by
11 a few thousand people. There are some word lists and other resources for Waropen [37], while
12 there are word lists and a sketch grammar for Sengseng [38,39]. Waropen is no longer spoken by
13 children, and only half of the children of Sengseng users speak it [31]. Magori is a nearly extinct
14 language of Papua New Guinea that had 100 users in 2000 [31]. It is known, however, to have
15 undergone large-scale lexical and structural borrowings from Magi, a Papuan language [40], and
16 because borrowings from unaccounted languages are ignored when computing ED, our estimate
of EDR probably overestimates the uniqueness of the language. Xârâcùù is a language of southern
..............................................................
17
18 New Caledonia spoken by some 6000 people [41], and although not currently endangered, it is
19 considered near threatened.
20 There are multiple complementary approaches for language preservation. However, for
21 largely undocumented languages close to extinction, recording is an essential first step, for
22 if there is no record of a language beyond its current speakers, there will be no reviving it
23 once those speakers are lost. The exercise of ranking languages by both level of endangerment
24 and distinctiveness is useful for identifying global priorities that maximize linguistic diversity.
25 However, such prioritisation lists can, at best, only help to inform preservation programs, and do
26 not take into account other factors such as the quantity and quality of existing documentation, the
27 practicality of working in particular regions, or the cultural, social, and political contexts unique
28 to each language [42,43]. This is an important caveat as in addition to identifying languages
29 that might be prioritized, we show that neither EDR nor EDGE are randomly distributed
30 geographically. Both linguistic diversity and the drivers of language extinction risk are known
31 to be geographically patterned [44,45], which may offer opportunities to prioritize groups
32 of languages by proximity, leveraging the resources necessary for documentation to multiple
33 languages at once. Similar challenges and opportunities arise in species conservation.
34 We should be cognisant that our measures of ED reflect only the information that is used to
35 create the tree. Any single language tree is unlikely, therefore, to fully capture linguistic diversity.
36 Aside from lexical change (new or modified words for the same things), linguistic change involves
37 semantic change (existing words that shift meanings), phonetic change (change in pronunciation),
38 phonological change (change in the frequency or number of phonemes), and syntactic change
39
(change in syntax). These different types of language changes can occur together, either because a
40
change in one aspect of a language provokes changes in the other [46], or because external factors
41
induce changes on several of these aspects simultaneously. However, they may not necessarily
42
evolve in synchrony, as changes in one dimension can be independent of changes in another
43
dimension. Our case study is based on lexical diversity, but could be extended to encompass
44
other dimensions of linguistic diversity.

50 6. Conclusion
51
52 The EDGE scores presented here provide an illustration of the potential benefits in borrowing
53 methods and theory from one field, here conservation biology, and applying them to another, here
54 language preservation. In other examples, the similarity of language and species trees might find
55 the flow of information reversed [47]. We considered over 350 languages, yet these represent only
56 a subset of Austronesian languages. We show that such missingness has only a small effect on the
57 ED scores of included languages. Importantly, tree incompleteness never lowers EDGE scores, so
58 it does not create false negatives. In addition we present a novel method to evaluate robustness
59 of ED measures estimated from incomplete trees, which has utility in biology and linguistics.
60 However, languages cannot be assessed if we lack data for them. It is notable that while only
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos

7 210 words are needed to include a language in the phylogeny we used, even these data are 9
8 missing for the majority of languages. Perhaps one of the most pressing priorities, therefore, is to
9 gather the data required to build more inclusive language trees. Large, well sampled species trees
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
10 have transformed our understanding of macroevolution [48–51] and helped shape conservation
11 priorities (see Mace et al. 2003 [52]). The construction of more comprehensive language trees is
12 likely to benefit linguists, anthropologists, historians, and support biocultural diversity for its
13 own intrinsic value.

ar Dr. Power,
ank you for your invitation to revise our manuscript, entitled “Tongues on the EDGE: Language
servation priorities based on threat and lexical distinctiveness”, to Royal Society Open Science. We
sent here an illustration of how language threat and distinctiveness can be merged to provide a
mework for setting language preservation priorities that parallels approaches in conservation
logy. As is the case for the integration of evolutionary distinctiveness into species conservation
grams, our framework is not intended to be definitive, rather we anticipate that it will be iteratively
ised and improved through time with improved data, methods, and discussion among stakeholders.
plying this framework to the majority of languages is currently hindered by limited data, but
wing interest and availability of both language phylogenies and threat assessments suggest that it
ght be possible to soon apply such approaches more widely.
thank you and the reviewers for the positive and constructive suggestions. We note that many of the
ncerns of the reviewers were more focused on the particularities of the indices and input data rather
n the conceptual framework we wish to present. As we describe below, we have attempted to
dress the reviewers’ concerns in the text as much as possible, although we acknowledge the
itations of the available data and contrasting opinions as to the preferred metrics in the literature. We
ve also worked to improve the clarity in our description of the methods and also include R code that
roduces our phylogeny reconstruction approach. While revising the code we identified a small
mber of languages that were duplicated in the input data. We have therefore re-run our analyses to
rect for this error. Importantly, we note that changes in language EDGE values where minor, and our
ults remain qualitatively unchanged. We apologize for not catching this sooner. We hope you will
d our revisions have increased both the clarity and impact of our manuscript.
ank you again for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you soon,
xwell J. Farrell
behalf of all co-authors)
ar Mr Farrell,
e editors assigned to your paper ("Tongues on the EDGE: Language preservation priorities based on
eat and lexical distinctiveness") have now received comments from reviewers. We would like you to
ise your paper in accordance with the referee and Associate Editor suggestions which can be found
ow (not including confidential reports to the Editor). Please note this decision does not guarantee
ntual acceptance.
ase submit a copy of your revised paper within three weeks (i.e. by the 14-Oct-2017). If we do not
r from you within this time then it will be assumed that the paper has been withdrawn. In
eptional circumstances, extensions may be possible if agreed with the Editorial Office in advance.
do not allow multiple rounds of revision so we urge you to make every effort to fully address all of
comments at this stage. If deemed necessary by the Editors, your manuscript will be sent back to
e or more of the original reviewers for assessment. If the original reviewers are not available we may
ite new reviewers.

mments to the Author(s)
now this is to be an "objective review", but I do want to say that this is a fascinating study and a
ic approach taken from conservation biology that may well contribute to the field of linguistics in
vel ways. Hats off to the authors for taking this on.
at said, I am a bit concerned that the arbitrariness of the GE scoring might detract from its impact. I
e the authors to include and highlight alternative measures, including ranking languages at the high
d of the extinction risk category by ED. The EDGE algorithm is wholly arbitrary and is also on the
ng scuppered by the EDGE programme itself, meaning that nailing your colours to that particular
st may not be as useful as charting out a way to flexibly incorporate linguistic isolation into
oritization schemes based on p(extinction).
acknowledge that the choice of indices of GE, ED and their relative weightings might be perceived
arbitrary, and similar criticisms have been applied to the IUCN Red List classification scheme.
ernative GE and ED indices will rank languages differently (see also our responses below);
netheless, they are designed to provide quantitative and objective results once the choice of indices
been made. To emphasise that we used one of several possible threat scales, in the second to last
agraph of the introduction we list three alternative endangerment scales – one by conservation
logist William Sutherland, one by UNESCO, and the EGIDS scale used by the Ethnologue. We now
pand this list to also include endangerment assessment published by the Endangered Languages
ject (www.endangeredlanguages.com), which was alerted to us by recommendation of Reviewer 2.
additionally include a citation to the original paper describing EGIDS by Lewis & Simons (2010),
ich explicitly compares threat assessment protocols. Our choice of endangerment metric was largely
ed upon ‘taxonomic’ coverage (see also responses below). In conversations with the EDGE team, it
s our understanding that the EDGE index will be around largely unchanged for the next year or so,
d is still widely employed. However, as noted by the reviewer, changes to EDGE are being
nsidered (or have perhaps been already approved), both to encompass extinction risks of related taxa
hich would also be possible to implement in our framework), and the adoption of p(extinction). The
iewer emphasizes the latter in their comment above. The shift from GE to p(extinction) is a
ighting transformation. The original EDGE metric assumed a doubling of extinction risk for each
reasing rank in the Red List classification hierarchy (Isaac et al. 2007), but Red List ranks can be
ply re-weighted as the probability of extinction (Steel et al. 2007) and a new ‘EDGE’ calculated.
e language endangerment scores are not yet so easily translated in to p(extinction), but once
ficient data is available, it would be straightforward to adopt a similar reworking of our language
GE metric. We have included some additional text on this potential in the “Measuring GE”
section of the Methods.
ave made many comments on the manuscript using "annotate-add note" in Preview. Purple ones are
more serious, while yellow ones are suggestions (like noting that ED and GE are actually positively
related in this dataset) and queries. All the comments are aimed at making the manuscript more
elligible and to increase impact (the tree production section is not good at all: the authors took a
mplicated but seemingly reasonable approach to a hard problem, but that does give one a pass from
cribing it properly).
th regards to the SM:
think a figure outlining the algorithm for adding in the missing species to supplement the 350 spp
ay tree for calculation of the ED scores would be helpful.
agree and have added a multi-panel commented figure (Figure 1 in SI). We have also re-written the
cription of the algorithm to make it clearer.
annot visualize exactly where the "absent clades" are placed on the Gray tree. It seems they are
ded to a node, not along an edge. Is this true?
apologize for the lack of clarity in our original description of the reconstruction algorithm. To an-
er the reviewer’s question, yes they are added to a node and not an edge. When there is just one lan-
age in the absent clade, this is the node in Gray et al.'s tree immediately subtending it. When there
several languages in the absent clade, this node is the most recent common ancestor of these lan-
ages in Gray et al.'s tree. This is now made explicit in step 4 of the reconstruction algorithm detailed
he Supplementary Information.
t ever the case that the topology of the Gray tree is not consistent with the topology from the
nologue taxonomy – if so, steps 3-5 might not be smooth.
s topological inconsistencies may occur in some cases, however as the Gray tree is taken as the pri-
ry template and the Ethnologue topology is used only to account for placement of languages not in
ay et al.'s tree, inconsistencies in placement of languages included in the template tree will not be en-
untered. In the new SI figure that illustrates the algorithm, the two starting trees have different ty-
ogies for languages 9, 10, and 11.
r step 2, you mean "language or group of languages in the Gray tree..", correct?
s, we hope this is now made clear in the re-written algorithm.
e measured the betterment of a reconstruction method by the proportion of uncertainty it removes
m the reduced tree, so that R2 coefficients of 0.5 and 0.9 are improved by 50% if the method brings
m to 0.75 and 0.95 respectively."
o you mean by 5%? I do not see how these improvements can be 50%.
indeed mean 50% not 5%. We rewrote this section to make it more mathematically formal, and
pefully clearer. If one lets the uncertainty in the ED scores be defined as 1 – R2, the betterment is de-
ed as the proportion of uncertainty removed by the reconstruction:
tterment = (ED uncertainty in reduced tree – ED uncertainty in reconstructed tree)/(ED uncertainty
reduced tree)
= [(1 – R2reduced) – (1-R2reconstructed)] / (1 – R2reduced)
= 1 – (1 – R2reconstructed)/(1 – R2reduced)
removed the two examples cited above for clarity. Perhaps the following four examples would have
n better (we only incorporated the first one in the text):
all of the following cases, the betterment is said to be of 34% because 34% of the uncertainty has
n eliminated.
se A, R2 before reconstruction: 0.99900
se A, R2 after reconstruction: 0.99934
se B, R2 before reconstruction: 0.9900
se B, R2 after reconstruction: 0.9934

Re: Figure 1 and Figure 2. I think you have redundant terms for trees here connecting these two
ures to each other and to the text: "reduced", "complete", "original", "reconstructed" and "true." I
ieve there are only three trees from which ED scores are measured – the reduced tree, the complete
onstructed tree, and the complete true tree.
have added a section at the beginning of the Supplementary Information defining the eight kinds of
es used in the analysis:
Gray et al.'s tree.
The Ethnologue tree.
The hypothetical full Austronesian tree.
The reconstructed full Austronesian tree.
Reduced Gray trees.
Reconstructed Gray trees.
Random trees.
Reduced random trees.
the rewritten Supplementary Material, these are the names we used and are now consistent through-
the manuscript.
e correlation of the complete reconstructed ED scores and the complete true tree scores (of the ED
res for the reduced set of species in each case) is always higher than the correlation between the
res of the same tips taken from reduced tree and the complete true tree. (I would hope so!).
, this is not always the case. As mentioned in the text, when one removes 72.2% of the tips from
ay et al.'s tree, the reconstruction worsens the estimate 1.8% of the time. It only makes it better
2% of the time. The text gives the frequency of the betterments:
0.5%, +24.2%] 50% of the time
.2%, +30.3%] 80% of the time
1.2%, +37.1%] 95% of the time
is means that 97.5% of the time, the reconstruction will better the estimate by at least 1.2%.
.6%, +43.4%] 99% of the time
is means that once in 200 the reconstruction will worsen the estimate by 4.6% or more and once in
0 it will better the estimate by 43.4% or more.
2.5%, +50.7%] 99.9% of the time
is means that once in 2000 the reconstruction will worsen the estimate by 12.5% or more and once in
00 it will better it by 50.7% or more.
e caption of Figure 2 now reads "For any number of removed tips, the mean of the red dots [R2 of re-
nstructed trees] is always significantly higher than that of the blue dots [R2 of reduced trees]." This is
rect. It means that for any number of removed tips, the average R2 relating to reconstructed Gray
es is higher than the average R2 relating to reduced Gray trees.
ase check, and see if you cannot tighten up the description of what you did here.

: “Rhetorically, we start with species and triage? The stats on the loss of language and their value
uld seem a better hook to this paper.”
e reviewer suggests to re-organize the introduction to first introduce the loss of languages rather than
loss of species. We have chosen to start with a description of species loss rather than languages as
s was our conceptual starting point and inspiration, and we feel that current biodiversity crisis is
haps more widely recognized than the loss of languages. However, if the reviewer feels strongly on

agree that the link to prioritisation need to be made more explicit, and have added the following
tence to the end of the first paragraph: “The rapid rate of language loss coupled with limited
ources for preservation indicates that formal prioritisation schemes may be useful tools to
ximizing the retention of linguistic diversity.”
: “not sure I would use “uniqueness” here, both grammatically nor conceptually. isolation and

have retained the inheritance analogy as we feel it may be helpful for readers unfamiliar with these
es of phylogenetic metrics. However, if the editor or reviewer still feels it is weak, we would be
ppy to remove it.
thank the reviewer for identifying the lack of citation for alternative ED metrics. We have amended
final sentence of the paragraph to read:
ollowing Isaac et al. (2007), we used a metric of ED in which ancestral distinctiveness is divided
nly among all living descendants, although distinctiveness may be split in other ways (Redding
03, Redding & Mooers 2006).
: “Below you say you use a 1249 language tree. The methods need to be rewritten to lay out exactly
at the input tree was that allowed ED scores to be calculated, and how it was constructed, pruned,
dified, etc.”
have re-written the Methods section in their entirety to make them clearer. We have also added a
w figure to illustrate how the input tree was obtained. Part (c) has been merged into (a), and the end
(a) relating to GE has been separated into its own paragraph.

: “Table 1 makes no sense to me - and you are using “level” here ambiguously - you mean IUCN
eat level, the EGIDS level. The conversion seems to have been made with care, but is there any
son to create this equivalence?”
agree with the reviewer that the use of “level” may be unclear to some readers, and is correct that
mean increases in one threat level, or unit, of GE (our constructed IUCN-style threat level). We
ve amended this sentence to read:
o measure the probability of extinction, we converted the 10-point EGIDS scale of language
dangerment into a Global Endangerment index (GE, Table 1). GE parallels the IUCN Red List [30],
which increases of one unit in GE represent a doubling in the probability of extinction (Details and
nversion scheme in SM Table 1).”
have also clarified this in legend of Table 1:
efinition of global endangerment (GE) scores for language endangerment. GE is a conversion of the
IDS endangerment scale that parallels Isaac's conversion of the IUCN Red List, in which increases
one unit in GE represent a doubling in the probability of extinction. The age of youngest users is the
st important criterion for the EGIDS scale (Details in SI, Table 1.)”
the case for the original EDGE metric, each increase in Red List threat level corresponded to a
ubling of extinction risk [p(extinction]. We follow this convention here to emphasize the parallel
h the EDGE framework, but as we now discuss subsequently in the manuscript, this assumption can
easily changed.
: “I would wager more than “somewhat” in response to the line “We would expect endangerment
les to yield somewhat different EDGE scores”
have clarified the sentence under criticism to read:
uncorrelated with EGIDS, we would expect other endangerment scales to yield different EDGE
res.”
: “Did you consider using the number of speakers as a measure of p(ext), as we did for populations
species in Volkmann et al. PloS One? Or perhaps this information is not available? This substitutes
e set of assumptions (doubling per rank shift on a 5 point scale, and a particular weighting of ED and
) with another (converting n to p(ext)) but does allow for a smoother set of expected loss figures
D*p(ext)). I prefer expected loss to EDGE as a more meaningful measure (due to that wholly
itrarily weighting of ED and GE in EDGE), but of course, the two use the same input data.”
agree with the reviewer on the attractiveness of using p(extinction)—a reweighting of ED in the
ginal EDGE framework— especially where more continuous threat indices are available. As noted
the reviewer, this would give a smoother scale of endangerment. There are estimates of the absolute
mber of L1 speakers for a subset of Austronesian languages available via the Catalogue of
dangered Languages. However, the EGIDS framework, which is available for the largest number of
guages in the available phylogeny incorporates some information on speakers numbers in the
ntext of intergenerational transmission, which the authors believe is more important for language loss
n the number of L1 speakers alone (Lewis & Simons 2010, Assessing endangerment: Expanding
hman's GIDS).
acknowledge the potential for this we add the following sentence to the “Measuring GE” section:
ecause GE is simply a multiplier in the calculation of EDGE, it would be straightforward to
stitute our GE index for alternative estimates of p(extinction), such those of William Sutherland
therland 2003), UNESCO's atlas of the world's languages in danger (Moseley 2010), or if data are
ilable, calculation of p(extinction) based on total number of speakers (Volkmann 2014).”

ank you.
: “indeed, and not “relatively”, but absolutely. Not to throw a fly in the ointment, but the EDGE
gram has now abandoned the EDGE metric, meaning you do not have to stick with it. One can
culate expected loss OR, more usefully, rank endangered species by their ED values, allowing for
oritization and avoiding compound metrics entirely. I will raise this issue in my additional
mments, and leave it up to the editor whether it is wise to hang this very interesting paper on the
GE flagpole.”
have clarified this by removing the word “relatively” so that the sentence now reads:
he weightings of ED and GE in the original EDGE metric are arbitrary”
have retained our original usage to parallel that of EDGE, although we appreciate that the EDGE
m will be making changes to how EDGE will be calculated. As noted above, this is mostly in
nges to the weighting of GE. We understand that the new EDGE will still be called EDGE. As our
guage EDGE is based upon a different set of threat criteria, the language tree branch lengths are not
units of times, and our relative weighting of ED and GE differ to that in the original EDGE metric,
think of our approach as more inspired by EDGE. We note that as we also present a summary table
h separate ED and GE scores, it would be straightforward for the interested reader to rank one by
other should they wish, although we are not sure whether this would present a more useful
oritisation list (at minimum, there must be some mental arithmetic that trades-off ED against GE).
0: The weightings of ED and GE in the original EDGE metric are “completely, wholly arbitrary.”
ted, see response to comment Y9.
: “So, ED and GE are positively correlated in your data (p=0.02); this might go up with better
asures of GE. Is that worth noting?”
thank the reviewer for highlighting this aspect; however, we note that the correlation in our data is
ually very weak, although we recognize improved data might increase the correlation strength, and
have thus added the following sentences to the first paragraph of the Results section:
e found ED and GE to be only weakly correlated. Nonetheless, as our choice of GE is just one
ssible index of language endangerment, and alternative scales or transformations of language threat
ght strengthen the relationship between ED and GE.”

is statement was made under the initial observation that the EDGE scores were approximately
mally distributed, though upon further inspection they appear to be slightly positively skewed. We
ve this removed this paragraph from the manuscript.
3: “nor would you expect them to be: geography and language relationships would be expected to be
related, no?”
agree with the reviewer in that we would not expect relative ED or EDGE to be randomly
tributed with respect to geography, but we think the observation is still important. This is also the
e for species extinction risk, and has proven useful for conservation prioritisation and understanding
drivers of endangerment.
4: “so the 350 languages are grouped somehow (French Polynesia, Formosan, etc.) - best to tell us
at this grouping criterion is (political, geographic, language clade, etc.)”
this paragraph we are grouping by country. We agree that referring to “Formosan languages” in this
ntext may be confusing for some, and have clarified in the text that these are languages spoken by
indigenous peoples of Taiwan.
have amended the first sentence of the paragraph to start as such:
s for EDGE scores across other countries, ...”
5: “this observation leads to a possibly interesting additional measure - HEDGE, or the isolation of a
considering the p(ext) of relatives. Here, Tahitian might score highest of all, bearing linguistic
ponsibility for other, at risk lineages.”
now mention this potential extension of the EDGE metric that additionally captures extinction risks
close relatives (in subsection Calculating the EDGE):
n extension of EDGE, HEDGE (``heightened'' EDGE), also includes information on the
xtinction) of close relatives, such that an endangered language would be up-weighted if closely
ated languages were also endangered Steel 2007.”
also note it might further elevate the need to prioritise certain languages, as noted by the reviewer
e final paragraph of the Results). However, it would not have been appropriate for us to use the
DGE metric in our analyses due to the large number of missing languages (i.e. we could not be
tain that we were not missing a closely related language that had a very different GE score to a
guage within our sample), as explicitly stated in subsection Calculating the EDGE:
hile this is a useful approach when setting global conservation priorities, the HEDGE metric is not
propriate in our case due to the large number if missing languages (i.e. we cannot not be certain that
were not missing a closely related language that had a very different GE score to a language within
sample).”
6: “why listed alphabetically?”
e six languages listed are not in alphabetical order, but rather are ordered from highest to lowest
GE score, as indicated in the text:
he six highest ranking EDGE languages (Table 2) were [...]”
7: “Does your GE measure capture the extremely high p(ext) for this language, spoken in a single
lage by elders and no current schoolin? Is it merely double a GE=3 language with a few thousand
akers and word lists?”
ase refer to responses to comments P4, Y6, & P6.
8: “this is an example where HEDGE might be useful - clusters of languages that alll score highly
ause all are at some level of risk (e.g. the Formosan clade)”
agree, although we do not use HEDGE here, it is one of several natural extensions of the EDGE
tric that could be explored using these same data. We now mention HEDGE in subsection
lculating the EDGE, see also responses above.

1: “You are missing / symbols throughout here, making this unintelligible. Note that the 0-4 scale
EDGE that you are mapping onto is an arbitrary weighting against ED. Is that what you wanted?” in
erence to Table 1
thank the reviewer for catching this. The missing fractions have been added. We used the 0-4
ling because it most closely parallels the current EDGE framework (see response to P4). We agree
t the relative weighting of ED and GE should be carefully considered along with the data used to
nerate them, and describe our choice of weighting in the “Calculating the EDGE” subsection of the
thods.
2: “Nice figure if you like EDGE”
ank you.
3: “is this the 350spp tree, or the 1249 spp tree?” in reference to Figure 2
apologize for the lack of clarity. The figure does not deal with the 1215-language tree, only the 350-
guage tree. We have re-written the caption of this figure (now Figure 3) make it clearer.
ow robust ED is to missing languages. Every one of these 35,000 points represents the R 2 between
ED scores of Gray et al.’s tree (350 languages) and the ED scores of one of its sub-trees. Each sub-
e was obtained by randomly removing from Gray et al.’s tree a fixed proportion of languages
resented on the x-axis. Even when 71.2% of tips are removed (vertical line), ED scores correlate
ll to that of Gray et al.’s tree, with R 2 = 0.78 on average (horizontal line). If sub-trees with 101
guages (i.e., with 71.2% of the 350 languages removed) are reconstructed to 350 languages with
nologue data, as detailed in the Methods but not depicted here, the average R 2 rises from 0.78 to
2. In Gray et al.’s tree of 350 languages, 71.2% of the 1215 ISO 639-3 Austronesian languages are
ssing. We therefore expect that the ED scores of the reconstructed tree used in this analysis are good
proximations.”
: “I do not think this is correct - your measure is relative, so the rankings could change substantially
missingness is non-random on the tree. Given this is a prioritization exercise, one could get “false
gative.” If one were comparing absolute values, then I would agree.” - in response to “tree
ompleteness never lowers EDGE scores, so it does not create false negatives”
have re-phrased this sentence to read:
ee incompleteness never lowers EDGE scores, though it is possible that relative rankings could

4: “be clear that you mean missing for languages generally, not for your subsample, correct?” – in
ards to the need for 210 words being needed to include a language in the phylogeny we used.
apologize for the misunderstanding, but wish to clarify that we do mean that only 210 words are
ded for a language to be included in the phylogeny we used. While this is for our own data, the
mple is used to illustrate the general principle that language phylogenies can in some cases be
ated using little input data.
have altered the sentence to explicitly indicate we are referring to missing Austronesian languages:
is notable that while only 210 words are needed to include additional languages in the phylogeny we
d, even these data are missing for the majority of Austronesian languages.

mments to the Author(s)
viewed an earlier version of this paper for another journal. Looking at the comments from the
vious reviews (mine and others), I see that many points have been taken into account. This has
nsiderably strengthened the paper, in my view.
ank you.
e biggest problem is to do with the relationship between missing taxa and their impact on the EDGE
re. To see why this is a problem, consider why a language might be missing - for large and relatively
mplete phylogenies, most likely, it's because data were not readily available. The controlling for
omplete trees through data partitioning and subsetting assumes that the full sample is representative
the world. But that's not true here, because sampling omission is in large part based on access to
terials, which is a function of number of speakers and implies an urgency of documentation (if
akers are still alive).
is is a reasonable concern that deserves more attention in the main article, we have added a
agraph to that effect in the Methods section. One may divide the argument, as we understand it, in
ee parts, and we will address them in sequence:
An important reason for which many languages are absent from the tree is that they are not well-
ested.
is is indeed partially correct, some languages are surely missing because they are not well
cumented, and the 350 languages used here are well documented enough to build the phylogeny
ray et al. 2009). It is, however, not the only reason. Gray et al. (2009) restricted the number of
guages in their tree in part because of computational constraints. The authors had access to a 150-
mputer cluster from the Centre for Advanced Computing and Emerging Technologies at the
iversity of Reading. It took this cluster more than one month and a half to accomplish the task. Some
stronesian languages, like Filipino, are very well-attested yet absent from the tree.
Those languages that are not well-attested might be those that are the most endangered and most
rthy of attention in the first place. Therefore, it is likely that the sample of languages in the tree is
sed against the most endangered languages or groups of languages.
mentioned in Gray et al. (2009), the 350 languages in Gray et al.'s tree "include a representative
mple of each recognized Austronesian subgroup". We have explicitly included this in the manuscript.
s true that languages absent from Gray et al.'s tree are on average more endangered than those
sent in the tree. Nevertheless, this effect is not as strong as one may expect. We include the
lowing section in the subsection “Effect of missing languages on ED” to further clarify:
n average, languages present in Gray et al.'s tree have an endangerment score of 1.21 and languages
ent from the tree, a score of 1.49. Of languages included in Gray et al.'s tree, 33% of languages are
eatened (GE=2), whereas this is the case for 41% of excluded languages. Among languages included
he phylogeny, 13% are endangered (GE=3) meaning that they are only spoken by the parent
neration and older, while this is the case for 15% of excluded languages. Among included languages,
\% of languages are moribund (GE=3.5), meaning that they are only known to the grand-parent
neration and older. This figure is 7.4% in excluded languages. These figures suggest that there may
weak bias towards inclusion of less-endangered languages in the phylogeny.”
e bias in favour of languages that are not endangered is therefore real but quite weak. We do not
ieve it affects the validity of our conclusions. Besides, for those languages excluded on the grounds
insufficient material, it is quite possible that the EDGE approach will encourage this material's
lection.
lated to this, how does this measure take phylogenetic uncertainty into account?
hile the Gray et al. methodology produced a Bayesian posterior of hypothetical trees, from which we
re provided a summary tree in which branch lengths represent the median number of cognate
nges undergone on that branch across trees sampled from the posterior distribution. If the posterior
vailable for the tree of interest, EDGE scores could be additionally computed using ED measures
oss a sample of posterior trees, thus taking into account phylogenetic uncertainty in the ED
imates.
have now mentioned this in the Discussion:
ur case study is based on lexical diversity, but should be extended to encompass other dimensions of
guistic diversity (Dunn 2014), and account for uncertainties in the resulting trees.”
s also worth noting that the ED metric we used is influenced most strongly by tip edge-length, and
s incongruence deeper in the tree will have only very small impact on ED or EDGE.
e other comment is to do with the endangerment scale. In the previous review, I suggested the use of
a from endangeredlanguages.com, which included information on documentation as well as speaker
mbers. This doesn't seem to have been addressed, and it's an important point. Given that one of the
in reasons for doing these calculations is to figure out which languages to prioritize in
cumentation, building in what linguistic resources are already available seems a logical step.
acknowledge that absolute speaker numbers may be useful information to include in the Global
dangerment score, and mow mention endangeredlanguages.com in the manuscript as an alternative
he EGIDS scale (Introduction paragraph 9). As mentioned above, we have chosen EGIDS for it’s
re complete coverage of the languages in the Gray et al. tree. Additionally, the authors of the EGIDS
mework believe speakers numbers in the context of intergenerational transmission is more important
language loss than the number of L1 speakers alone (Lewis & Simons 2010, Assessing
dangerment: Expanding Fishman's GIDS).
we did choose to include information on absolute number of speakers, the data from
dangeredlanguages.com is only available for less than 100 of the languages included in our analysis,
d many of these are ranges rather than precise values. In addition, while we recognize that this
bsite provides valuable resources for language preservation, we are hesitant to use data from it
ectly as there is no link to a peer-reviewed publication describing the database, nor could we easily
d metadata or informative headers included with the .csv available at
p://www.endangeredlanguages.com/userquery/. Assuming that the second column represents the
O639 code, we have joined our GE metric to this .csv (accessed October 2, 2017). According to the
ormation file on the Catalogue of Endangered Languages
tps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7vQLUpU_2qcVEVqNzFKWFA2cUk/view), the endangerment
els of Safe, Vulnerable, Threatened, Endangered, Severely Endangered, and Critically Endangered
respond to numeric values of 0-5. Included in the .csv are categories of "At risk", "Awakening", and
ormant", for which there is no mention in the information file. Removing these, we estimate the
relation between GE and the endangeredlanguages.com endangerment score to be 0.635, calculated
the 100 languages present in both databases. Depending on your perspective, the strength of this
relation might seem comforting or concerning. We believe it further highlights the importance of
arly defining the input data when deriving any down-stream metric.
ally, there are some very odd choices for referencing. For example, reference 24 (on dialects) is
out artificial grammars. Reference 21 is a book chapter, not an article. References are poorly
matted, with stray {} and missing capitalization. Reference 46 is an odd choice (a minor paper about
ingle French word, which draws some totally incorrect conclusions about syntactic change, which
in contradiction to this paper's conclusions) given the vast literature on syntactic change and
ernal causation.
apologize for the inconsistent formatting of the bibliography and thank the reviewer for catching

Languages are being lost at rates exceeding the
27
global loss of biodiversity. With the extinction of
28 a species, we lose vital ecosystem services and
29 functions. With the extinction of a language we
30 lose irreplaceable dimensions of culture, and insight
31 it provides on human history and the evolution
32 of linguistic diversity. When setting conservation
33 goals, biologists give higher priority to species
34 likely to go extinct. Recent methods now integrate
35 information on species evolutionary relationships
36 to prioritise the conservation of those with few
37 close relatives. Advances in the construction of
38 language trees allow these methods to develop
39 language preservation priorities that minimize loss of
40 linguistic diversity. The EDGE (Evolutionarily Distinct
41 and Globally Endangered) metric, increasingly used
42 in conservation biology, accounts for a species’
43 originality (evolutionary distinctiveness — ED) and
44 its likelihood of extinction (global endangerment —
45 GE). Here, we use a similar framework to inform
46 priorities for language preservation by generating
47 rankings for 350 Austronesian languages. Kavalan,
48 Tanibili, Waropen, and Sengseng obtained the highest
49 EDGE scores, while Xârâcùù, Nengone, and Palauan
are among the most linguistically distinct, but are not
50
currently threatened. We further provide a way of
51
dealing with incomplete trees, a common issue for
52
both species and language trees.

7
8 There is growing evidence that we are in the midst of a sixth mass extinction event and mankind
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
is likely the cause [1,2]. Since the 1950s, scientific and public awareness of the loss of biodiversity
9
has increased considerably [3], but we lack both resources and time to save all endangered
10
species. Some species will go extinct and we must make choices and set priorities in species
11
conservation [4]. Many human languages are equally, if not more threatened [5]. It is estimated
12
that one of the world’s 7000 languages vanishes every other week and half might not survive
13 the 21st century [6]. Languages are the spark of a people, the bearing of cultures, and are tied
14 to a special understanding of native environments. Their disappearance is a loss to humanity,
15 scholarship, and science [7]. Prehistorians study languages to trace back population movements
16 [10,11] and anthropologists use language trees to test hypothesis of cultural evolution [12,13].
..............................................................
17 Linguists use the variety of parlances to understand language as a human phenomenon; every
18 single tongue gives them additional insight [7]. Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), often
19 used in biodiversity conservation efforts [14–17], is imperilled if languages are lost [18,19]. The
20 rapid rate of language loss coupled with limited resources for preservation indicates that formal
21 prioritisation schemes may be useful tools to maximizing the retention of linguistic diversity.
22 In conservation biology, there have been efforts to prioritise species based on their evolutionary
23 distinctiveness with the idea that highly distinct species might have unique traits that contribute
24 to biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems [20,21]. For example, species with many close
25 relatives might provide few unique ecosystem services. Conversely, species with few relatives are
26 usually the most functionally original and may provide irreplaceable services [4,22]. Likewise in
27 linguistics, the more isolated a language in its family tree, the more unique information it contains
28 and ultimately contributes to linguistic diversity. Prioritising the documentation of threatened
29 and isolated languages is a key goal in linguistics [6]. Recently developed methods for quantifying
30 similarity among languages [23] offer new opportunities to inform these prioritisations.
31 In biology, phylogenetic trees (”trees of life”) depict species ancestor-to-descendant
32 relationships. Two populations of a single species will evolve into two species when gene flow
33 is interrupted, often by geographic isolation [24]. One can consider speciation complete when
34 two populations can no longer interbreed [25]. Speciation is depicted in the tree by the splitting
of branches. Likewise, though a simplification, dialects become languages when the speakers of
35
one dialect can no longer understand speakers of the other. Like new species, diverged dialects
36
are splits in a language tree.
37
We can quantify a species’ evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) by measuring how isolated it is
38
on a phylogenetic tree. Species isolated in the tree are said to be evolutionarily distinct. Similarly,
39
we can quantify linguistic distinctiveness from language trees. Once a set of features is selected
40 and a tree built from them, distinctiveness scores can be calculated and used as empirical and
41 objective estimates of uniqueness among languages. There are many distinctiveness metrics [26],
42 but all aim to favour species with few close relatives.
43 Early distinctiveness metrics counted only the number of splits in a species’ ancestry, giving
44 higher scores to fewer splits [4,27]. Such metrics are highly sensitive to missing data (absent splits
45 in the tree). More recent measures treat the lengths of tree branches as units of distinctiveness,
46 usually counted in millions of years. In these cases, a species’ distinctiveness is equal to the
47 length of its branch plus a fraction of that of its ancestors. Like money that people inherit from
48 their mother, fewer siblings mean larger inheritance. If the mother herself had few siblings, she
49 inherited more from her parents and in turn would have more to leave to her children. Further,
50 with a constant salary, the longer she lived, the more money she would have to leave them.
51 Following Isaac et al. (2007) [28], we used a metric of ED in which ancestral distinctiveness
52 is divided evenly among all living descendants, although distinctiveness may be split in other
53 ways [29,30].
54 Isaac et al. (2007) [28] determined the ED from a near complete species-level phylogenetic tree
55 for mammals with branch lengths proportional to time. Implicit within their calculation is an

6 assumption that species differentiate at a constant rate through time, i.e. that branch lengths 3
7 measured in evolutionary time capture the expected differences between species. ED being a
8 weighted sum of branch lengths, also represents time in millions of species-years. The platypus
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
9 for example has an ED of about 97.6 million years, the greatest ED in the mammal phylogeny.
10 The assumption of constant divergence through time, however, does not hold up well for
11 languages. Since Icelandic and Norwegian diverged from Old Norse one thousand years ago,
12 the basic vocabulary of Norwegian has changed five times faster than that of Icelandic [31]. This
13 is not an isolated example — time is thus only a poor estimator of linguistic distinctiveness. A
14 language’s ED is therefore better computed from a language tree whose branch lengths convey
15 distinctiveness directly. Here, we use a tree based on the proportion of ancestral words substituted
16 for newer words in a language’s basic vocabulary.
..............................................................
17 To prioritise conservation efforts so as to minimise the expected loss of diversity,
distinctiveness can be weighted by the probability of extinction – p(extinction) [8]. To estimate
18
this probability, Isaac et al. (2007) [28] used the endangerment levels of the IUCN red list [32],
19
an objective qualitative scale of species extinction risk, assuming each increase in red list threat
20
category represents a doubling in p(extinction). Taking a species’ evolutionary distinctiveness
21
(ED) and global endangerment (GE) as proxies for its contribution to diversity and probability of
22
extinction, a species’ EDGE score is calculated as follows:
23
24 EDGE = ln(1 + ED) + GE · ln(2) (1.1)
25 At least four endangerment assessments analogous to the IUCN Red List have been created
26 for languages: a list by conservation biologist William Sutherland [5], UNESCO’s atlas of the
27 world’s languages in danger [33], a database by the Endangered Languages Project (www.
28 endangeredlanguages.com), and the EGIDS scale [34] used by the Ethnologue, an online
29 database of 7000 languages [35]. Given a detailed language phylogeny, it is hence possible to
30 apply techniques from conservation biology to language preservation.
31 Here we illustrate how the EDGE framework can be applied to linguistic diversity using a
32 tree of several hundred Austronesian languages built on differences in basic vocabulary (210
33 words), typically stable through time and resistant to borrowing from other languages. This
34 tree represents one of the largest language families in the world, likely originating from Taiwan
35 4000-6000 years ago and then rapidly expanding through islands of the Pacific [36]. The exercise
36 of ranking languages with the EDGE metric can identify languages that are both distinct and
37 threatened, which might be considered important targets for documentation and preservation,
38 if not done already. Although we analyse only a subset of Austronesian language diversity, we
39 present a method that corrects for limited sampling, and show that our results are surprisingly
40 robust to missing languages in the phylogeny.
41
42 2. Methods
43
44 (a) Measuring ED
45
The tree used in this analysis has 1215 tips representing the 1215 living ISO 639-3 Austronesian
46
languages. The tree is a composite of two data sets: a 350-tip tree with branch lengths from Gray et
47
al. (2009) [37] and, to provide supplementary information, language classification data by the
48
Ethnologue. Gray et al.’s tree is the core dataset. It is based on lexical data from Greenhill et al.
49 (2008) [56], consisting for each language of 210 basic words thought to be stable over time and
50 resistant to borrowing. Branch lengths in Gray et al.’s tree represent the median number of cognate
51 changes undergone on that branch across trees sampled from a Bayesian posterior distribution.
52 Importantly, Gray et al. made no assumption that words change at a constant rate over time.
53 The tree in Gray et al. (2009) consists of 400 languages chosen based on data availability and to
54 provide “a representative sample of each recognised Austronesian subgroup” [37]. From this set
55 we removed 16 languages that were extinct, not Austrosenian or without an ISO 639-3 code from
56 the International Organization for Standardization [57]. We further removed 34 Austronesian

5
6 dialects that shared an ISO 639-3 code with another language in the tree, always keeping the 4
7 dialect with the greatest ED. This resulted in a tree with 350 languages (hereafter “Gray et al.’s
8 tree”).
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
9 Of the 1215 living Austronesian languages, 71.2% are not represented in Gray et al.’s tree,
10 and missing languages may be expected to affect ED scores. To account for this effect, we
11 complemented the phylogeny with language classification data from the Ethnologue, which
12 groups all ISO 639-3 languages into families and subfamilies. The Ethnologue classification for
13 Austronesian languages was converted into a tree with no meaningful branch lengths, and then
14 missing languages were inserted into Gray et al.’s tree (Figure 1, details in SI). This resulted in a
15 1215-tip tree (hereafter the “reconstructed full Austronesian tree”) used to calculate ED following
16 the fair proportion method described by Isaac et al. (2007) [28]. ED was estimated for only those
..............................................................
17 350 living ISO 639-3 Austronesian languages present in Gray et al.’s tree.
18
19 (b) Measuring GE
20
To measure the probability of extinction, we converted the 10-point EGIDS scale of language
21
endangerment into a Global Endangerment index (GE, Table 1). We chose this approach to
22
quantifying GE because it parallels the IUCN Red List [32] because it most closely matches to
23 the original EDGE framework published by Isaac et al. (2007) [28] in which increases of one threat
24 level double the probability of extinction (Details and conversion scheme in Table 1, SI). Because
25 GE is simply a multiplier in the calculation of EDGE, it would be straightforward to substitute
26 our GE index for alternative estimates of p(extinction), such those of William Sutherland [5],
27 UNESCO’s atlas of the world’s languages in danger [33], or if data are available, calculation of
28 p(extinction) based on total number of speakers [9]. If uncorrelated with EGIDS, we would expect
29 different endangerment scales to yield different EDGE scores. The EGIDS, however, is the only
30 complete scale for the languages in our sample.
31
32
33 (c) Effect of missing languages on ED
34 As mentioned above, missing languages may be expected to affect ED scores, an effect data from
35 the Ethnologue cannot be expected to correct entirely. To assess this effect, we performed the
36 following sensitivity analyses. Given that 71.2% of the 1215 Austronesian languages are missing
37 in Gray et al.’s 350-language tree, we randomly pruned from it 249 languages. This yielded a
38 101-language tree (hereafter a “reduced Gray tree”), lacking 71.2% of the languages in Gray et
39 al.’s original tree. We then calculated the R2 between the ED scores from Gray et al.’s tree and
40 the reduced Gray tree. We repeated this process 10,000 times, each time obtaining a new reduced
41 Gray tree by randomly pruning 249 languages. On average, the ED of the reduced Gray tree and
42 that of Gray et al.’s tree correlated to an R2 of 0.78, and to 0.75 ± 0.14, 99% of the time. One may
43 then apply, on the reduced Gray trees, Ethnologue data with the procedure mentioned in (a) to
44 partially reconstruct Gray et al.’s tree, yielding “reconstructed Gray trees”. On average, the ED
45 scores of reconstructed Gray trees and those of Gray et al.’s tree correlated to an R2 of 0.82, and to
0.78 ± 0.14, 99% of the time. We note, however, our analyses assume that languages are missing at
46
random, which is unlikely to be true. Because there are a vast number of possible permutations, it
47
is difficult to robustly assess impacts of non-random missingness. Nonetheless, we might logically
48
predict that tips within clades with many missing taxa will be more impacted, whereas tips falling
49
in clades with few missing taxa will be less impacted.
50 We then generalised this procedure from 249 pruned languages to any number of pruned
51 languages. It appears that the R2 between the ED scores of Gray et al.’s tree and that of the tree
52 with pruned languages does not decrease linearly with the number of tips removed (Figure 3).
53 The ED scores appear initially resilient. (By contrast, if this sensitivity analysis is performed not
54 on Gray et al.’s tree but on a random tree generated with the ape [63] package of the R statistical
55 language, the R2 decreases linearly and is on average equal to the percentage of tips left in the
56 reduced tree.)

6 These sensitivity analyses also assume that the 1215 languages Gray et al. (2009) included in 5
7 their tree were a random subset of all Austronesian languages. Inclusion of languages in the
8 phylogeny is influenced by the availability of data, and there there may be bias in favour of well-
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
9 documented languages, whereas those languages least well-documented may also be the among
10 the most endangered. On average, languages present in Gray et al.’s tree have an endangerment
11 score of 1.21 and languages absent from the tree, a score of 1.49. Of languages included in Gray et
12 al.’s tree, 33% of languages are threatened (GE = 2), whereas this is the case for 41% of excluded
13 languages. Among languages included in the phylogeny, 13% are endangered (GE = 3) meaning
14 that they are only spoken by the parent generation and older, while this is the case for 15% of
15 excluded languages. Among included languages, 6.9% of languages are moribund (GE = 3.5),
16 meaning that they are only known to the grand-parent generation and older. This figure is 7.4%
..............................................................
17 in excluded languages. These figures suggest that there may be weak bias towards inclusion of
less-endangered languages in the phylogeny.
18
19
20
(d) Calculating the EDGE
21
22 Since branch lengths in the language tree were not proportional to time (as is often the case with
23 species trees), an absolute ED score is difficult to interpret. We therefore chose to use the relative
24 ED (EDR ), computed by dividing all ED scores by the average ED score. By construction, EDR
25 scores have a mean of 1, and a language with an EDR of 2 is twice as distinct as the average
26 language.
27 The weightings of ED and GE in the original EDGE metric are arbitrary [58]. To give
28 importance to both evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) and endangerment (GE), we adapted the
29 EDGE metric given in equation 1.1 by dividing the weight of the GE by 4, its maximum value:
30 1
EDGE = ln(1 + EDR ) + · GE · ln(2) (2.1)
31 4
32
Had we stuck to the original definition of the EDGE, rankings would have been dominated by
33 endangerment scores with little regard to distinctiveness (see Pearse et al. 2015 [59] for a similar
34 approach). An extension of EDGE, HEDGE (“heightened” EDGE), also includes information on
35 the p(extinction) of close relatives, such that an endangered language would be up-weighted if
36 closely related languages were also endangered [60]. While this is a useful approach when setting
37 global conservation priorities, the HEDGE metric is not appropriate in our case due to the large
38 number if missing languages (i.e. we cannot not be certain that we were not missing a closely
39 related language that had a very different GE score to a language within our sample).
40 We ran all analyses with the R statistical language [61] with the following libraries: we used the
41 ade4 [62], ape [63], and phytools [64] R packages to manipulate phylogenetic trees, picante [65] to
42 compute ED, phangorn [66] and geiger [67] to idenfity ancestral nodes, and plots were generated
43 using ggplot2 [68].
44
45
46 3. Results
47
We estimated EDGE using a novel method that allowed us to account for all 1215 Austronesian
48
languages in our ED scores by complementing Gray et al. (2009)’s [37] tree with language
49 classification data from the Ethnologue (full details on tree reconstruction in SI). ED and GE
50 were only weakly correlated (R2 = 0.008, p = 0.09). We found ED and GE to be only weakly
51 correlated. Nonetheless, as our choice of GE is just one possible index of language endangerment,
52 and alternative scales or transformations of language threat might strengthen the relationship
53 between ED and GE. As discussed above, we assessed the effect of missing languages on ED. We
54 expect a coefficient of determination R2 of ˜ 0.82 between the ED scores of the reconstructed full
55 Austronesian tree (the one used in this analysis) and that of the hypothetical full Austronesian
56 tree (within 0.78 ± 0.14, with 99% probability, details in SI).

6 We calculated relative ED (EDR ) for each language by dividing all ED scores by the average 6
7 ED score. EDR scores are approximately log-normally distributed (listed in SI, table 3), ranging
8 from that of Indonesian (0.15) to those of Kavalan (3.36) and Xârâcùù (3.66). EDR scores have a
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
9 geometric mean of 0.836 and a median of 0.847. Of the 350 languages for which we can measure
10 ED, 113 (32%) are threatened (GE = 2), representing 34% of the total measurable Austronesian ED.
11 EDGE scores are approximately normally distributed but slightly right-skewed (Figure 2), and
12 range from 0.15 (Indonesian) to 2.18 (Kavalan, Table 2), with an average of 0.786 and a standard
13 deviation of 0.35.
14 Neither EDR nor EDGE are randomly distributed geographically — the Philippines are a
15 striking example. Of the 350 languages studied here, 53 are of the Philippines (although Filipino
16 itself, also an Austronesian language, is not included). In the Philippines, 48 languages (91%)
..............................................................
17 have EDR below average, and 51 languages (96%) are in vigorous use (GE = 1). The Philippine
language with the highest EDR , Inabaknon, only ranks 83 out of 350, which is significantly lower
18
than expected by chance (p < 10-6 , see SI). Similarly, the Philippine language with the highest
19
EDGE, Central Tagbanwa, ranks 90 out of 350, again significantly lower than expected by chance
20
(p < 10-7 ).
21
As for EDGE scores across other countries, all five French Polynesian languages except
22
Tahitian are endangered, which makes French Polynesia the country with the highest average
23 GE among those countries with more than two languages (avg. GE = 2.41, n = 5). Under the
24 HEDGE framework, these languages would have been given even higher conservation priority.
25 Formosan languages, spoken by indigenous peoples of Taiwan, have the second-highest average
26 GE (1.91, n = 14). French Polynesian languages, however, have a much lower average EDR
27 (0.44) than Formosan languages (1.91); losing one average Formosan language would reduce
28 the total Austronesian ED more than losing all four endangered French Polynesian languages.
29 Only New Caledonian languages have higher average EDR (1.93) than Formosan languages, but
30 New Caledonian languages are not as threatened (avg. GE = 1.25, n = 7). High ED and GE make
31 Formosan languages the highest EDGE scoring on average (avg. EDGE = 1.38), followed by New
32 Caledonia (1.20).
33
34
35
4. Discussion
36 In linguistics, as in conservation biology, limited resources in conjunction with rapid rates of
37 extinction mean that efforts need to be optimised to maximise the preservation of diversity. Here
38 we suggest efforts to preserve linguistic diversity could benefit by borrowing from approaches
39 used in conservation biology that weight species by their evolutionary distinctiveness and global
40 endangerment (EDGE). Applying the EDGE metric to languages requires only an endangerment
41 score for each language, and a language tree whose branches reflect linguistic distinctiveness,
42 data that are already available for many languages.
43 We illustrate the linguistic EDGE on a 350-language Austronesian family tree. Our results
reveal striking disparities in the evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) among languages, here
44
reflecting a measure of lexical contribution to linguistic diversity. For example, the language
45
with the highest ED, Xârâcùù, contributes 23 times more than the language that contributes least.
46
The six highest ranking EDGE languages (Table 2) were Kavalan (EDR = 3.36, GE = 4), Tanibili
47
(EDR = 2.21, GE = 4), Waropen (EDR = 2.50, GE = 3), Sengseng (EDR = 3.13, GE = 2), Magori
48
(EDR = 1.88, GE = 4), and Xârâcùù (EDR = 3.66, GE = 1).
49 Kavalan is an exceptionally distinct yet nearly extinct language indigenous to Northeastern
50 Taiwan. In 2000, it had 24 speakers [35] and an ethnic population of 1000 living mostly in Eastern
51 Taiwan [38]. It is spoken in only one village, Sinshe, chiefly by elderly speakers. There have
52 been recent efforts to revive it in schools, but without proper funding the village could not train
53 language teachers [39]. Tanibili is one of three highly endangered languages of Utupua in Temotu
54 Province, Solomon Islands, none of which have more than a few hundred speakers and are almost
55 completely undocumented [40]. Waropen and Sengseng are languages of New Guinea spoken by
56 a few thousand people. There are some word lists and other resources for Waropen [41], while

6 there are word lists and a sketch grammar for Sengseng [42,43]. Waropen is no longer spoken by 7
7 children, and only half of the children of Sengseng users speak it [35]. Magori is a nearly extinct
8 language of Papua New Guinea that had 100 users in 2000 [35]. It is known, however, to have
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
9 undergone large-scale lexical and structural borrowings from Magi, a Papuan language [44], and
10 because borrowings from unaccounted languages are ignored when computing ED, our estimate
11 of EDR likely overestimates the uniqueness of the language. Xârâcùù is a language of southern
12 New Caledonia spoken by some 6000 people [45], and although not currently endangered, it is
13 considered near threatened.
14 There are multiple complementary approaches for language preservation. Yet, for largely
15 undocumented languages close to extinction, recording is an essential first step, for if there
16 is no record of a language beyond its current speakers, there will be no reviving it once
..............................................................
17 those speakers are lost. The exercise of ranking languages by both level of endangerment
and distinctiveness is useful for identifying global priorities that maximize linguistic diversity.
18
However, such prioritisation lists can, at best, only help to inform preservation programs, and do
19
not take into account other factors such as the quantity and quality of existing documentation,
20
the practicality of working in particular regions, or the cultural, social, and political contexts
21
unique to each language [46,47]. This is an important observation as in addition to identifying
22
languages that might be prioritised, we show that neither EDR nor EDGE are randomly
23 distributed geographically. Both linguistic diversity and the drivers of language extinction risk are
24 known to be geographically patterned [48,49], which may offer opportunities to prioritise groups
25 of languages by proximity, leveraging the resources necessary for documentation to multiple
26 languages at once. Similar challenges and opportunities arise in species conservation.
27 We should be cognisant that our measures of ED reflect only the information that is used
28 to create the tree, and other metrics of ED are available. Any single language tree or metric
29 is unlikely, therefore, to fully capture linguistic diversity. Aside from lexical change (new or
30 modified words for the same things), linguistic change involves semantic change (existing words
31 that shift meanings), phonetic change (change in pronunciation), phonological change (change
32 in the frequency or number of phonemes), and syntactic change (change in syntax). Similarly,
33 different ED metrics can give more or less weight to branches deeper in the tree, and thus
34 capture different language features. These different types of language changes can occur together,
35 either because a change in one aspect of a language provokes changes in the other, or because
36 external factors induce changes on several of these aspects simultaneously. However, they may
37 not necessarily evolve in synchrony, as changes in one dimension can be independent of changes
38 in another dimension. Our case study is based on lexical diversity, but should be extended to
39 encompass other dimensions of linguistic diversity [23], and account for uncertainties in the
40 resulting trees. We present here a first attempt at merging threat and distinctiveness for language
41 preservation.
42 As is the case for the species EDGE program, we anticipate and hope that our approach will
43 be revised and improved through time as alternative phylogenies are constructed, methods are
44 improved, and as we refine our knowledge of the status of languages around the globe.
45
46 5. Conclusion
47
The EDGE scores presented here provide an illustration of the potential benefits in borrowing
48
methods and theory from one field, here conservation biology, and applying them to another,
49 here language preservation. In other examples, the similarity of language and species trees might
50 find the flow of information reversed [50]. We considered over 350 languages, yet these represent
51 only a subset of Austronesian languages. We show that such missingness has only a small effect
52 on the ED scores of included languages. Importantly, tree incompleteness never lowers EDGE
53 scores, though it is possible that relative rankings could change. In addition we present a novel

55 utility in biology and linguistics. However, languages cannot be assessed if we lack data for
56 them. It is notable that while only 210 words are needed to include additional languages in the

6 phylogeny we used, even these data are missing for the majority of Austronesian languages. 8
7 Perhaps one of the most pressing priorities, therefore, is to gather the data required to build more
8 inclusive language trees. Large, well sampled species trees have transformed our understanding
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
9 of macroevolution [51–54] and helped shape conservation priorities (see Mace et al. 2003 [55]). The
10 construction of more comprehensive language trees is likely to benefit linguists, anthropologists,
11 historians, and support biocultural diversity for its own intrinsic value.
12 Data Accessibility. The data supporting this article has been uploaded as part of the supplementary
13 material, and includes the EDr, GE, EDGE, ISO639-3 code, and country for each language included
14 in the analysis, as well as each of the phylogenetic trees. ED was calculated based on the
15 Austronesian phylogeny of Gray et al. (2009) [37] built on data from the Austronesian Basic Vocabulary
16 Database [56], freely available online (https://github.com/D-PLACE/dplace-data/tree/master/

st of the issues I raised have been dealt with well - the explanation of how ED scores were created
ng the new figure is much clearer, though a few additional clarifications in the text are necessary (I
ow how easy it is to forget that readers do not actually know what you have done...). I have made
w comments using the "add note" tool (blue ones being more important). I am not comfortable with
strong statements linking ED to ecosystem functioning in the abstract and introduction, but I do not
nk it is necessary to do this to motivate the linguistic study - your reasons for valuing isolated
guages stand on their own. You must also give priority (or at the very least co-priority) to Redding
03) for the actual ED metric (Fair Proportion) used by Isaac et al. (2007). This was not done in this
sion.
F annotations of Reviewer 1:
: In reference to the second sentence of the abstract: “This link between loss of species and loss of
vices and fucntions is not well-established, and I would not lead off a paper on language loss this
y.”
have removed this sentence from the abstract.
: In reference to the EDGE (Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered) metric as increasingly
d in conservation biology, the reviewer asks “What evidence do you have of this?”
have removed the word “increasingly” from this sentence.
: In reference to the introduction: “Ok, I am happy with this introduction”
ank you.
: In reference to the start of the second paragraph of the introduction: “yes, original species may have
que traits that contribute to biodiversity as BD is generally defined, but it stops there”
acknowledge that the link between evolutionary distinctness (or its aggregate equivalent – Faith’s
) and ecosystem functioning remains debated (see Cadotte et al. 2017 for a recent discussion of the
rature); nonetheless, we feel it is important to note that these two facets of diversity are often linked
he literature (see Srivastavas et al. 2012), and there is some empirical support suggesting
olutionarily distinct species capture more ecological oddity (Redding et al. 2010) and that
ximising phylogenetic diversity in a species set captures more feature diversity (e.g. Forest et al.
07). We have now provided a more tempered discussion to better represent the current state of the
ld.
: In reference to citations 4 and 22: “Neither 4 nor 22 offer any information on whether isolated
cies are fucntionally original or offer irreplaceable services. “With the idea that” in the previous
tence captures the state of the art. Please remove.”
have removed these references.
: In reference to the last line of introduction paragraph 3: “Might be worth citing Schleicher’s (1863)
e Darwinsche Theorie und die Sprachwissenschaft here, since it is the first linguistic tree and it
kes the analogy to phylogenetic trees explicit.”
ank you for the suggestion. This reference has been included in the manuscript.
: In reference to the last line of introduction paragraph five: “As I noted before, Isaac’s precise ED
re (as used here) was published by Redding in 2003, and Dave sent a copy of his thesis to the ZSL
hat time. He must get priority (or at the very leaset, co-priority) not only for the general idea, but
o for the actual metric. As his former supervisor, I will insist on this.”
apologize for this oversight. After the previous round of revision we included this reference as was
gested, but overlooked the explicit attribution of the ED metric to Redding (2003). We hope the
lowing revised sentence provides the suitable attribution:
evised by Redding (2003) and employed by Isaac et al. (2007), we used a metric of ED in which
estral distinctiveness is divided evenly among all living descendants, although distinctiveness may
calculated in other ways.”
the end of this sentence we also include a citation to Redding et al. 2014, which provides alternative
asures of evolutionary isolation, and discussed the history of the EDGE ED metric. We also cite this
dy at the end of paragraph five of the introduction.
: In reference to the last line of introduction paragraph five: “distinctiveness is not ‘split’”
have changed “split” to “calculated”.
: Missing “it: in sentence: “ED being a weighted sum of branch lengths, also represents time in
llions of species-years.”
have reformatted this sentence to read:
D, being a weighted sum of branch lengths, also represents time in millions of species-years.”
: In reference to the second last paragraph of the introduction: “This comparison of EDGE to what
u are doing is much better, thanks.”
ank you.
0: “missing a comma here before ‘because’” in reference to sentence: “We chose this approach to
antifying GE because it parallels the IUCN Red List [32] because it most closely matches to the
ginal EDGE framework published by Isaac et al. (2007) [28] in which increases of one threat level
uble the probability of extinction (Details and conversion scheme in Table 1, SI).”
have re-worded this sentence to read:
e chose this approach to quantifying GE as it parallels the IUCN Red List [35] and most closely
tches to the original EDGE framework published by Isaac et al (2007) in which increases of one
eat level double the probability of extinction (Details and conversion scheme in Table 1, SI).
1: “why “William” Sutherland, rather than “Sutherland”?” in reference to Methods b).
have removed “William”.
2: In reference to the first paragraph of Methods c): “Why? Because there are still languages
ssing from the Ethnologue dataset? Did you tell us this?”
e reviewer is wondering why we claim that Ethnologue cannot be expected to correct for missing
guages entirely and assumes that this is because the Ethnologue tree is missing languages. The
nologue is not missing languages, but does have unresolved polytomies in the Ethnologue tree.
have now made this explicit in the text:
s mentioned above, missing languages may be expected to affect ED scores, an effect that data from
Ethnologue cannot be expected to correct entirely because of unresolved polytomies.”
: In reference to the first paragraph of Methods c): “Not clear whether these correlations are done on
1 languages or all 350. One would assume 101 (since that mimics what you do with the full set), but
writing suggests 350.”
have now made this paragraph more explicit:
iven that 71.2 % of the 1215 Austronesian languages are missing in Gray et al.'s 350-language tree,
randomly pruned from it 249 languages. This yielded a 101-language tree (hereafter a ``reduced
ay tree''), lacking 71.2% of the languages in Grayet al.'s original tree. We then calculated the R2
ween the ED scores from Gray et al.'s tree and the reduced Gray tree. We repeated this process
000 times, each time obtaining a new reduced Gray tree by randomly pruning 249 languages. On
rage, the ED of the reduced Gray tree and that of Gray et al.'s tree correlated to an R2 of 0.78, and
0.75 +- 0.14, 99\% of the time. One may then apply, on the reduced Gray trees, Ethnologue data with
procedure mentioned in (a) to partially reconstruct Gray et al's tree, yielding ``reconstructed Gray
es'', for which ED scores may be computed for the 101 languages present in the reduced tree. On
rage, the 101 computable ED scores of each reconstructed Gray tree and those of the corresponding
1 languages in Gray et al.'s tree correlated to an R2 of 0.82, and to 0.78 +- 0.14, 99 % of the time.”
: In reference to the second paragraph of Methods c): “Which - the pruning procedure, or the
ning and subsequent addition procedure? I appreciate these are hard method sections to write, but
re care must be taken. One could not, for instance, do the pruning and addition procedure on R-
duced rtrees…”
apologize for the lack of clarity. In this instance we are referring to the pruning procedure, and have
de this explicit in the text.
3: In reference to the final section of Methods c): “nice addition”
ank you.
4: In reference to title of Methods d): “EDGE “scores”
e title of this subsection has been changed accordingly.
: In reference to the second paragraph of Methods d): “indeed, that is why EDGE is ultimately so
y arbitrary.”
have acknowledged this limitation of the EDGE metric, and state explicitly that the “… weightings
ED and GE in the original EDGE metric are arbitrary”. This challenge applies to almost all
ltivariate indices.
5: In reference to Results paragraph one: “This first sentence is not a result, and should be dropped.”
e first sentence of this paragraph has been removed.
6: In reference to correlation between ED and GE: “repeat sentence here”
e second repetition has been removed and the beginning of the paragraph now reads:
D and GE were only weakly correlated (R2=0.008, p=0.09). Nonetheless, [...]”
7: In reference to final sentence of Results paragraph one: “Again, the methods suggest that you are
ncentrating on the ED scores of only 350 languages, but this sentence suggests that you are expecting
orrelation of ED across 1215 languages.”
ll spotted, we now make explicit the reference to the 350 languages for which ED was measured.
8: In reference to Results paragraph two: “Not a result, please remove and start wtih “ED_R (the
ative ED score) ranged…” Indeed, this would seem to be the first result, before reporting the
relation between ED and GE, no?”
e first sentence of this paragraph has been removed, and the order of the first and seconfd paragraphs
the results are now switched.
9: In reference to final paragraph of Results: “careful with “total” here, since you are confined to
y 350 languages - perhaps “measured”?”
ank you for the suggestion, “total” has now been replaced with “measured”.
: In reference to Discussion paragraph one: “In the intro, you do a good job of using EDGE more as
otivation- here you are suggessting explicitly using a “weighting scheme”. Are you SURE you
nt to suggest that linguists use EDGE, or rather that linguists should incorporate isolation into
oritization?”
ank you, and we agree that the focus on EDGE is too explicit. We have re-worded this paragraph so
to be more general:
linguistics, as in conservation biology, limited resources in conjunction with rapid rates of
inction mean that efforts need to be optimised to maximise the preservation of diversity. Here we
gest efforts to preserve linguistic diversity could benefit by borrowing from approaches used in
nservation biology that include both distinctiveness and global endangerment. Applying these types
metrics to languages requires only an endangerment score for each language, and a language tree
ose branches reflect linguistic distinctiveness, data that are already available for many languages.”
