Review comments: RSOS-170296, “Transcriptional response to West Nile virus infection in the
zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata).
General: The manuscript by Newhouse et al. presents interesting and novel results from an
experimental study aiming at characterizing gene expression change as a result of West Nile virus
(WNV) infection. The research is novel in the sense that data on the response to WNV infection
has been restricted to other organism groups, while birds so far have been ignored, despite being
major hosts for WNV in the wild. The experimental set-up is straightforward including case–
control groups and two separate stages of infection (2 and 4 days post infection), although sample
sizes are rather limited (3 biological replicates for each case and for the control, respectively, in
total 9 birds) and an additional control group (sacrificed at 2 dpi) would strengthen that some of
the observed patterns are related to infection and not treatment per se. Data are analyzed with
routinely used pipelines to quantify gene expression from RNAseq data, although a combination
of gene expression quantification methods and/or more conservative significance thresholds may
have strengthened the interpretation of the results. The results indicate that, similar to mammals,
birds engage the RLR signaling pathway when challenged with WNV infection. Several genes
not involved in the RLR are also significantly differentially expressed and these represent both
the innate and the adaptive immune response. This is interesting and in line with the observation
from other taxa, indicating some level of conservation in WNV response across diverse
organismal groups. The manuscript follows a logical alignment and is very well written. In my
opinion it would attract interest from both researchers interested in host-pathogen interactions
and avian biology as well as evolutionary biologists in general.
As touched upon above, my main concerns relate to i) the lack of a control group for 2 dpi
(controls were only sacrificed at 4 dpi), and, ii) the rather vague justification for having a relaxed
significance threshold for differential gene expression.
i) As far as I understand there is a risk that gene expression differences between controls
and 2 dpi may be a consequence of lack of null data for that stage. All controls were sacrificed at 4
dpi. In the very likely scenario that there is an effect on gene expression also from the treatment
procedure itself (almost every treatment affects gene expression) it would be optimal to have a
control set representing non-infected treatments sacrificed at 2 dpi. If this is an option and rather
straightforward to get, I think it would strengthen the results. If not, I think a piece of discussion
on the potential drawbacks of a lack of control for 2 dpi is necessary.
ii) The results show that two major genes in the RLR pathway are upregulated as a
consequence of WNV infection, DDx58 and IFIH1. Both genes have previously been shown to
directly affect WNV infection in mammals. However, one of the genes (IFIH1) is marginally
significant at a relaxed significance level (FDR of 0.1) and it would definitely strengthen the
conclusions that these genes play major roles in zebra finch WNV response should the analyses
be expanded to include other expression quantification tools. DEseq2 might be conservative, but
to verify that there is a suite of alternative methods that could be run on the data (some are listed
in reference 71).
Besides that I only have a few very minor comments:
Mapping of on average at least 5 reads per sample is used as a threshold for including a
transcript in the analyses. As far as I understand the coverage distribution for all genes included
in the analyses are not presented anywhere? It would be of interest to know the coverage for the
genes detected as differentially expressed (DE) in comparison to non-DE genes. An extra column
in Table 1 could be used to provide that information. Was there a correlation between coverage
and DE?

This paper describes transcriptional changes of genes in the liver of zebra finch in response to the
West Nil virus infection. Although the results described in this paper might be far from
elucidating the molecular mechanism for immune response to the West Nile virus infection
including both the innate and acquired immune responses in the wild birds including zebra
finch, it may be acceptable for publication, because the data are all novel so that they may
contribute to other researches regarding the West Nile virus infection in the wild birds. However,
the following minor revision would be necessary before acceptance for publication.
In Table 1, the value of Log2 Fold Change for IFITM10, "1.24" may be "-1.24".

Appendix A
As touched upon above, my main concerns relate to i) the lack of a control group for 2 dpi
(controls were only sacrificed at 4 dpi), and, ii) the rather vague justification for having a
relaxed significance threshold for differential gene expression.
i) As far as I understand there is a risk that gene expression differences between controls
and 2 dpi may be a consequence of lack of null data for that stage. All controls were sacrificed
at 4 dpi. In the very likely scenario that there is an effect on gene expression also from the
treatment procedure itself (almost every treatment affects gene expression) it would be
optimal to have a control set representing non-infected treatments sacrificed at 2 dpi. If this
is an option and rather straightforward to get, I think it would strengthen the results. If not, I
think a piece of discussion on the potential drawbacks of a lack of control for 2 dpi is
necessary.
- We have added discussion of this limitation at lines 308-313. While ideal to have a 2dpi control, this
experiment is presently not feasible (collecting new samples is not possible, and even if we did collect
them, they would be difficult to compare given the addition of numerous uncontrolled variables). All
birds in the experiment were acclimated to the room well before the start of the experiment, so there is
no reason to think time in the room might affect them. Additionally, BA1 contains a very small BSA.
While this could potentially elicit a stress response or a mild immune response, the amount used in the
Control group was very small (~5 µg) and likely not enough to elicit the immune gene expression
changes we see.
ii) The results show that two major genes in the RLR pathway are upregulated as a
consequence of WNV infection, DDx58 and IFIH1. Both genes have previously been shown to
directly affect WNV infection in mammals. However, one of the genes (IFIH1) is marginally
significant at a relaxed significance level (FDR of 0.1) and it would definitely strengthen the
conclusions that these genes play major roles in zebra finch WNV response should the
analyses be expanded to include other expression quantification tools. DEseq2 might be
conservative, but to verify that there is a suite of alternative methods that could be run on
the data (some are listed in reference 71).
-FDR <0.10 is the default cutoff in the DEseq2 package and is used in the DEseq2 manuscript (Love et
al. 2014, Genome Biology). We have now indicated this at Line 412. There does not seem to be a
consensus on FDR cutoffs in RNAseq studies, but in general FDR <0.10 is common (e.g. Wu et al. 2015,
Bioinformatics; Videvall et al. 2015, MBE). As a result, we chose 0.10 a priori.
-We previously performed DE analysis using EBseqHMM, also. However, IFIH1 is not significantly
differentially expressed using this approach. We suspect that sampling various other software will result
in some cases where we find significant DE, and others where we do not, so we recognize that this result
is statistically marginal. We’ve updated Figure 2 to more clearly present the data for this gene, including
the expression plot for IFIH1 and display the NS EBseqHMM result. We focus our discussion on individual
genes primarily from the DEseq2 analysis as there is often variation on gene calls between tools.
Besides that I only have a few very minor comments:
Mapping of on average at least 5 reads per sample is used as a threshold for including a
transcript in the analyses. As far as I understand the coverage distribution for all genes
included in the analyses are not presented anywhere? It would be of interest to know the
coverage for the genes detected as differentially expressed (DE) in comparison to non-DE
genes. An extra column in Table 1 could be used to provide that information. Was there a
correlation between coverage and DE?
- We present the mean of normalized counts for each significant DE gene in Supplemental Table S3. We
also note that the expression plots in Figure 1 and Figure 2 show normalized read counts for some of the
key differentially expressed genes. A fundamental component of the DEseq2 approach (and RNA-seq in
general), is that low-expressed genes should have higher variance. Thus we expect our significantly
differentially expressed genes to be relatively high-expressed genes. We note in the discussion that we
will likely have missed some genes that are regulated in response to infection, and low-expressed genes
fall in this category. Such genes could only be detected as DE with larger (possibly much larger) sample
size.
L81-82. Complicated sentence. Might be written more clearly.
-We divided this sentence in two and slightly reworded to improve clarity.

-Thank you for pointing this out. The value is correct, but the regulation pattern was wrong. Regulation
pattern now reads “Up”.
