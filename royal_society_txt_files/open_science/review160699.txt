label_comment_2
In keeping with the ethos of the journal, I am happy to identify myself as a reviewer: Kristen
Panfilio, University of Cologne, developmental geneticist with expertise in live cell imaging of
epithelial morphogenesis.
In this succinct research article, Hall and colleagues present the use of X-ray video imaging as a
means to generate live, time-lapse movie images of pupation in the blow fly Calliphora vicina.
This approach is complemented by micro-computed tomography of fixed material to provide
greater anatomical resolution of selected developmental stages. Although I do not have personal
experience with micro-CT scanning techniques, the work is clearly an extension of the authors’
previous work in 2012 with fixed material, and it represents a modern advance on live imaging
visualization of dipteran larvae from cited literature from the second half of the twentieth
century. While the current work is not sufficiently detailed to serve as a reference atlas for
pupation in this species, it does demonstrate the potential of a technique that can readily be
applied to diverse holometabolous insect species and in a fairly high throughput manner for
developmental screening, albeit with low spatial resolution. On these grounds, I find the
manuscript a potentially beneficial addition to the literature if a few technical and conceptual
concerns, described below, can be addressed, and with some minor rounding out of the
manuscript text.
3
My main concern is the degree to which the X-ray recordings accurately reflect wild type, healthy
pupation. To address this, further information is required on: (1) the sample sizes recorded, (2)
the eclosion success rate after imaging, and (3) the degree of spatial and temporal variation
between individuals for the developmental features described. The discussion mentions
lowering the X-ray energy when additional images are collected for three-dimensional rendering.
Please comment on the feasibility of this in terms of energy required in relation to the contrast/
signal of the image compared to specimen health. For rapid development, it would also be
appropriate for the authors to comment on image acquisition rate in this context. (To what extent
would a z-stack be blurred due to the time it takes to acquire multiple optical sections relative to
the rate at which the developing pupa “dances”?)
Secondly, as a corollary to this concern, I would encourage the authors to augment their
descriptive account so that the value of the study as a developmental reference is strengthened.
A much more precise and detailed description of the selected still images in Figure 1A-H,
supported by additional anatomical labels on the images, would be very helpful. In addition to
the original images, juxtaposed, labeled versions, perhaps false-colored as in 1I, would address
this. Also, I was not able to clearly perceive the “separation of the thorax and abdomen” touted
in the introduction (line 113). In general, this imaging approach provides very low spatial
resolution with rather low contrast, and without prior familiarity it is very difficult to discern
specific features or events.
Thirdly, the authors should be cautious in their claims about the degree of new information
obtained in the present study regarding the gas bubble, and indeed about the significance of the
bubble overall. While it is claimed in the introduction that the bubble is crucial for pupal
development (line 99), the preceding literature account merely supports the idea that it is a
diagnostic landmark that correlates with healthy development, not that the bubble has a direct
functional role per se. Similarly, the claim in the discussion section that the study “confirms the
essential role” of the gas bubble (line 196) is not supported, as no functional, manipulative
experiments were performed to test this.
Otherwise, my comments are primarily minor revisions to improve the text:
As two extant species that share a common ancestor have evolved for the same length of time
since that common ancestor, neither is more evolved than the other. In the abstract and
introduction, please avoid the phrase “the more highly evolved Diptera” in referring to the
Cyclorrhaphan.
In the introduction, I missed a more general account of why the blow fly is of particular interest
in terms of the motivation for this study (e.g., lines 42 and 107). Given the wealth of information
available for Drosophila, what differences make Calliphora vicina specifically an important
research species?
In discussing imaging approaches for pupal development and specifically for eversion of the
imaginal discs, I missed citations to the fluorescent live imaging work from Matthew Freeman’s
lab:
- Aldaz, S., Escudero, L.M., and Freeman, M. (2010). Live imaging of Drosophila imaginal disc
development. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 107, 14217-14222
- Aldaz, S., Escudero, L.M., and Freeman, M. (2013). Dual role of myosin II during Drosophila
imaginal disc metamorphosis. Nat. Commun. 4, 1761.
While these papers took an ex vivo, culturing approach, while the current study visualizes
pupation in toto, the claim on lines 202-204 about the degree of improved resolution in the
present study should be tempered.
For methodology, please include information on the following:
- how the species of wild caught flies was determined
4
- relative humidity of the incubator
- citation or further description of how it can be determined when the “transformation into an
ovaloid shape was irreversible” (line 126)
- was any washing of the puparium necessary prior to mounting it in the petri dish?
- how precise was the mounting on tape in terms of dorsal-ventral orientation?
- the precise Photoshop image adjustments made to improve contrast (where they non-linear?)
Line 164 should cite panel 1B as well.
The progression of apolysis is subtle and the relevant images are small (Figure 2B,D compared to
2F,H). Please use arrows, dashed lines, or other annotations to highlight the progression/ extent
of apolysis in panels B and D.
The wing discs are mentioned in relation to panels 2E-H, but they are not apparent.
Note that in an anglicized, adjectival form the term “cyclorrhaphous” should not be capitalized
(lines 91, 196).
Several sentences read for me as run-ons that were difficult to parse logically : lines 95-99, 178-
182. Similarly, a comma after “increases” in line 191 would help.
Allowing for international differences in orthography, I have nonetheless only seen “imaginal
discs” as a technical, anatomical term rendered with a “c”, not a “k”.
In figure 1, please double check the time stamps relative to the movie. What is labeled as time
23:00 in panel 1B appears to be time point 20 (= minute 19), while panel 1H appears to be time
point 124 (= 02:03). Also, as mentioned above, please label the anatomical features in the movie
stills, and provide a scale bar and a legend indicating that anterior is up. Please also label the
yellow body in the image in panel 1I.
In the movie file, please add a time stamp.

In this manuscript, Hall et al. use X-ray video imaging and micro-computed tomography (µCT) to
visualise metamorphosis of the blowfly Calliphora vicina. They present one in vivo X-ray video
imaging movie as well as µCT sections of fixed specimens at three different developmental time
points.
Purely descriptive, this manuscript provides an interesting view on metamorphosis. The
manuscripts adds little to our knowledge of metamorphosis per se, as most of what is shown is
already known from studying other Diptera/insects. However, the well-written manuscript adds
knowledge of metamorphosis of a further Dipteran fly, Calliphora, which so far has been difficult
to image due to its opaque pupal case. Also, as the whole organism is visualised, the presented
data provide a fascinating in toto perspective on metamorphosis. Furthermore, due to the
advances in imaging speed, the presented imaging highlights the speed of rearrangements taking
place in the pupa.
From how the authors have presented their work, it is not entirely clear to me how many
individuals were imaged in vivo. As the authors draw conclusions about the timing of
developmental events, it would be important to compare different individuals (at least n=3). This
would allow the authors to get information on potential variation in developmental timing. Also,
to follow developmental timing more easily, it would be useful, if the video would actually show
the timing.
Furthermore, it would be really useful to have the whole set of µCT sections of the three time
points available (maybe as supplementary videos).
The statement ‘combined with the jerkiness of the accelerated time-lapse makes it appear as if the
pupa is “dancing”’ (lines 176,177) is not scientifically informative and should be removed.

The text and figure labeling revisions are indeed very helpful. I particularly like the new movie
S2. Two points of ambiguity remain (very minor revisions).
11
Firstly, I cannot reconcile sample sizes and time-lapse intervals across Table 1 and the main text.
The response to reviews and Table 1 indicate that only one individual was filmed with a 1-minute
interval, while the main text refers to a preliminary and subsequent 6 individuals filmed with a 2-
minute interval. This is fine, but the main text seems to belie this, stating strongly in the abstract
(line 19) and introduction (line 117) that a one-minute interval was used for multiple puparia (line
117), and it is not clear from the methods section (page 153) that in fact this was a one-off, rather
than standard recommended procedure for readers wishing to reproduce these approaches.
Either I’ve missed something, or the main text needs to be amended to more accurately reflect
actual procedure.
Secondly, the authors refer to a second study as “under review” in the response letter but cite it
as “in press” as reference 21 of the actual manuscript – please reconcile. Regardless, though, I do
not see how the manner in which this work is cited (lines 92, 194) provides any information to
strengthen the argument about similarity of developmental rate across individuals.
As a minor point, the abstract may need a final polish as well. On line 15 “cyclorrhaphan” should
not be capitalized, and the phrase “dramatic metamorphosis from legless larva to winged adult”
is repeated almost verbatim in the first paragraph of the introduction.

The text and figure labeling revisions are indeed very helpful. I particularly like the new movie
S2. Two points of ambiguity remain (very minor revisions).
Firstly, I cannot reconcile sample sizes and time-lapse intervals across Table 1 and the main text.
The response to reviews and Table 1 indicate that only one individual was filmed with a 1-minute
interval, while the main text refers to a preliminary and subsequent 6 individuals filmed with a 2-
minute interval. This is fine, but the main text seems to belie this, stating strongly in the abstract
(line 19) and introduction (line 117) that a one-minute interval was used for multiple puparia (line
117), and it is not clear from the methods section (page 153) that in fact this was a one-off, rather
14
than standard recommended procedure for readers wishing to reproduce these approaches.
Either I’ve missed something, or the main text needs to be amended to more accurately reflect
actual procedure.
Secondly, the authors refer to a second study as “under review” in the response letter but cite it
as “in press” as reference 21 of the actual manuscript – please reconcile. Regardless, though, I do
not see how the manner in which this work is cited (lines 92, 194) provides any information to
strengthen the argument about similarity of developmental rate across individuals.
As a minor point, the abstract may need a final polish as well. On line 15 “cyclorrhaphan” should
not be capitalized, and the phrase “dramatic metamorphosis from legless larva to winged adult”
is repeated almost verbatim in the first paragraph of the introduction.

Associate Editor: 1
Comments to the Author:
The reviewers found the manuscript to be of great interest, but have requested a
number of revisions that will make the paper have even greater impact. These
revisions, in large part, are concerned with providing numbers and clearer
documentation of the results, so that readers can better appreciate the time-course
of Calliphora development, its variability and the details of the process.
Response: Thank you for this positive feedback. We have revised the manuscript in
response to the Reviewers’ recommendations to include more data and clearer
documentation, including additional preliminary videos, which we hope address the
concerns suitably. We are grateful to the three reviewers for their very helpful and
informed comments which have strengthened the manuscript.

Response: Thank you for these encouraging comments. We too are excited to
extend this work in a future study.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
In keeping with the ethos of the journal, I am happy to identify myself as a reviewer:
Kristen Panfilio, University of Cologne, developmental geneticist with expertise in live
cell imaging of epithelial morphogenesis.
In this succinct research article, Hall and colleagues present the use of X-ray video
imaging as a means to generate live, time-lapse movie images of pupation in the
blow fly Calliphora vicina. This approach is complemented by micro-computed
tomography of fixed material to provide greater anatomical resolution of selected
developmental stages. Although I do not have personal experience with micro-CT
scanning techniques, the work is clearly an extension of the authors’ previous work
in 2012 with fixed material, and it represents a modern advance on live imaging
visualization of dipteran larvae from cited literature from the second half of the
twentieth century. While the current work is not sufficiently detailed to serve as a
reference atlas for pupation in this species, it does demonstrate the potential of a
in a fairly high throughput manner for developmental screening, albeit with low
spatial resolution. On these grounds, I find the manuscript a potentially beneficial
addition to the literature if a few technical and conceptual concerns, described below,
can be addressed, and with some minor rounding out of the manuscript text.
My main concern is the degree to which the X-ray recordings accurately reflect wild
type, healthy pupation. To address this, further information is required on: (1) the
sample sizes recorded, (2) the eclosion success rate after imaging, and (3) the
degree of spatial and temporal variation between individuals for the developmental
features described. The discussion mentions lowering the X-ray energy when
additional images are collected for three-dimensional rendering. Please comment on
the feasibility of this in terms of energy required in relation to the contrast/ signal of
the image compared to specimen health. For rapid development, it would also be
appropriate for the authors to comment on image acquisition rate in this context. (To
what extent would a z-stack be blurred due to the time it takes to acquire multiple
optical sections relative to the rate at which the developing pupa “dances”?)
Response: We agree that the information provided in relation to items 1-3 above
was limited and so we have provided more detailed information on the samples
studied, eclosion success and variation between individuals (tabulated). We are
quite sure that the specimens studied were wild type and healthy. While the imaging
at a frequency of one-minute led to death of the specimen featured in the video, this
was not necessarily due to the radiation received during the period of
metamorphosis shown but to the fact that it was exposed to many extra minutes of
radiation because it was one of a batch and after imaging it we focussed on another
individual. We have included a preliminary X-ray video with images taken at two-
minute intervals to show that six other specimens pupated at the same rate. We
refer to other studies using greater time intervals in which pupation occurred in the
same time range and specimens emerged successfully. We also refer to a
manuscript under review in which we measured the increase and decrease in the
size of the gas bubble over time, which demonstrates the similarity in the timing of
this event for all specimens examined. We have included an additional comment in
the discussion on the feasibility of compensating for blurring due to movement,
making reference to a 2014 paper by Walker et al. which studied flight muscles of
live blow flies in 3-D.
Secondly, as a corollary to this concern, I would encourage the authors to augment
their descriptive account so that the value of the study as a developmental reference
is strengthened. A much more precise and detailed description of the selected still
images in Figure 1A-H, supported by additional anatomical labels on the images,
would be very helpful. In addition to the original images, juxtaposed, labelled
versions, perhaps false-colored as in 1I, would address this. Also, I was not able to
clearly perceive the “separation of the thorax and abdomen” touted in the
introduction (line 113). In general, this imaging approach provides very low spatial
resolution with rather low contrast, and without prior familiarity it is very difficult to
discern specific features or events.
Response: We have expanded our description of the main video and provided
labelling on the images as suggested and hope that this has improved the
interpretation of the images and video. The X-ray images are indeed of low spatial
resolution and that is why we provided the supporting micro-CT images.
Thirdly, the authors should be cautious in their claims about the degree of new
information obtained in the present study regarding the gas bubble, and indeed
about the significance of the bubble overall. While it is claimed in the introduction
that the bubble is crucial for pupal development (line 99), the preceding literature
account merely supports the idea that it is a diagnostic landmark that correlates with
healthy development, not that the bubble has a direct functional role per se.
Similarly, the claim in the discussion section that the study “confirms the essential
role” of the gas bubble (line 196) is not supported, as no functional, manipulative
experiments were performed to test this.
Response: We have toned down any claims about the degree of new information,
and have changed “confirms the essential role” to “supports the essential role”.
However, we believe that the literature referred to (especially that of Rewitz et al.,
2010) shows that the gas bubble does have a functional role, enabling the pupa to
move within the puparium so that head eversion can proceed.
Otherwise, my comments are primarily minor revisions to improve the text:
As two extant species that share a common ancestor have evolved for the same
length of time since that common ancestor, neither is more evolved than the other.
In the abstract and introduction, please avoid the phrase “the more highly evolved
Diptera” in referring to the Cyclorrhaphan.
Response: We have changed the term “the more highly evolved Diptera” to “the so-
called “higher” Diptera”, which is a commonly used term, e.g., in Wiegmann et al.
2011, a paper co-authored by many eminent Dipterists. We have also stated that the
Cyclorrhapha are monophyletic, again referencing the paper of Wiegmann et al.
In the introduction, I missed a more general account of why the blow fly is of
particular interest in terms of the motivation for this study (e.g., lines 42 and 107).
Given the wealth of information available for Drosophila, what differences make
Calliphora vicina specifically an important research species?
Response: We have included some references to the societal (pest, medical,
forensic) importance of this blow fly species.
In discussing imaging approaches for pupal development and specifically for
eversion of the imaginal discs, I missed citations to the fluorescent live imaging work
from Matthew Freeman’s lab:
- Aldaz, S., Escudero, L.M., and Freeman, M. (2010). Live imaging of Drosophila
imaginal disc development. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 107, 14217-14222
- Aldaz, S., Escudero, L.M., and Freeman, M. (2013). Dual role of myosin II during
Drosophila imaginal disc metamorphosis. Nat. Commun. 4, 1761.
Response: Please see below.
While these papers took an ex vivo, culturing approach, while the current study
visualizes pupation in toto, the claim on lines 202-204 about the degree of improved
resolution in the present study should be tempered.
Response: We have tempered our claims and placed them in context with other
studies of metamorphosis, including those of Aldaz et al.
For methodology, please include information on the following:
Response: Identification reference included.
- relative humidity of the incubator
Response: Data on relative humidity are now provided.
- citation or further description of how it can be determined when the “transformation
into an ovaloid shape was irreversible” (line 126)
Response: we have added further details of how this stage was determined.
- was any washing of the puparium necessary prior to mounting it in the petri dish?
Response: As now indicated, no washing of puparia was required.
- how precise was the mounting on tape in terms of dorsal-ventral orientation?
Response: An indication of the degree of precision was added.
- the precise Photoshop image adjustments made to improve contrast (where they
non-linear?)
Response: We have indicated the brightness adjustments made.
Line 164 should cite panel 1B as well.
Response: Thank you for pointing out this oversight – it was Figure 1B that should
have been mentioned rather than Figure 1A.
The progression of apolysis is subtle and the relevant images are small (Figure 2B,D
compared to 2F,H). Please use arrows, dashed lines, or other annotations to
highlight the progression/ extent of apolysis in panels B and D.
Response: Arrows have been added to show the extent of apolysis.
The wing discs are mentioned in relation to panels 2E-H, but they are not apparent.
Response: We have stated that the wings are not apparent in the figure but they
can be seen in the stacked files (Movies S5 and S6).
Note that in an anglicized, adjectival form the term “cyclorrhaphous” should not be
capitalized (lines 91, 196).
Response: Thank you – corrections have been made.
Several sentences read for me as run-ons that were difficult to parse logically : lines
95-99, 178-182. Similarly, a comma after “increases” in line 191 would help.
Response: We have made minor changes to improve the flow of these sentences,
including the addition of the suggested comma.
Allowing for international differences in orthography, I have nonetheless only seen
“imaginal discs” as a technical, anatomical term rendered with a “c”, not a “k”.
Response: Thank you for pointing out this error, now corrected.
In figure 1, please double check the time stamps relative to the movie. What is
labelled as time 23:00 in panel 1B appears to be time point 20 (= minute 19), while
panel 1H appears to be time point 124 (= 02:03). Also, as mentioned above, please
label the anatomical features in the movie stills, and provide a scale bar and a
legend indicating that anterior is up. Please also label the yellow body in the image
in panel 1I.
Response: All the labelling suggestions have been added to the figures and the time
stamps have been corrected.
In the movie file, please add a time stamp.
Response: A time stamp (hours:minutes) has been added and we agree that this
greatly improves the value of the video.
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
In this manuscript, Hall et al. use X-ray video imaging and micro-computed
tomography (µCT) to visualise metamorphosis of the blowfly Calliphora vicina. They
present one in vivo X-ray video imaging movie as well as µCT sections of fixed
specimens at three different developmental time points.
Purely descriptive, this manuscript provides an interesting view on metamorphosis.
The manuscripts adds little to our knowledge of metamorphosis per se, as most of
what is shown is already known from studying other Diptera/insects. However, the
well-written manuscript adds knowledge of metamorphosis of a further Dipteran fly,
Calliphora, which so far has been difficult to image due to its opaque pupal case.
Also, as the whole organism is visualised, the presented data provide a fascinating in
toto perspective on metamorphosis. Furthermore, due to the advances in imaging
speed, the presented imaging highlights the speed of rearrangements taking place in
the pupa.
From how the authors have presented their work, it is not entirely clear to me how
many individuals were imaged in vivo. As the authors draw conclusions about the
timing of developmental events, it would be important to compare different
individuals (at least n=3). This would allow the authors to get information on potential
variation in developmental timing. Also, to follow developmental timing more easily, it
would be useful, if the video would actually show the timing.
Response: We have now made clear the numbers of individuals involved in this
study and in preliminary studies which support the timing of pupation of the
specimen imaged in the main video (S1) and demonstrate that the dramatic changes
proceed at a similar pace in all specimens imaged, with some variation as indicated
in Table 1.
Furthermore, it would be really useful to have the whole set of µCT sections of the
three time points available (maybe as supplementary videos).
Response: We have supplied the µCT sections as supplementary videos as
requested, S3-S8.
The statement ‘combined with the jerkiness of the accelerated time-lapse makes it
appear as if the pupa is “dancing”’ (lines 176,177) is not scientifically informative and
should be removed.
Response: The word “dancing” was not meant to be scientifically informative, but it
was placed in apostrophes as a metaphor to illustrate to readers the dynamic stage
of metamorphosis captured by the video, which is also why we used the word
“dance” in the title. The statement can be removed without impact, but we would
prefer to leave the wording as it is and leave the decision to the Editor.

The text and figure labeling revisions are indeed very helpful. I particularly like the
new movie S2. Two points of ambiguity remain (very minor revisions).
Firstly, I cannot reconcile sample sizes and time-lapse intervals across Table 1 and
the main text. The response to reviews and Table 1 indicate that only one individual
was filmed with a 1-minute interval, while the main text refers to a preliminary and
subsequent 6 individuals filmed with a 2-minute interval. This is fine, but the main
text seems to belie this, stating strongly in the abstract (line 19) and introduction (line
117) that a one-minute interval was used for multiple puparia (line 117), and it is not
clear from the methods section (page 153) that in fact this was a one-off, rather than
standard recommended procedure for readers wishing to reproduce these
more accurately reflect actual procedure.
RESPONSE: Thank you for highlighting the ambiguity. We have made clear in the
text that one puparium was imaged at one-minute intervals and seven at two-minute
intervals (Table 1), although only six are shown in the Movies 2 video. Potential
ambiguity about numbers was addressed elsewhere (lines 152-161, 184-187 and
Table 1 footnote) and the new video with six puparia was given more prominence in
the text (e.g. lines 227-231).
Secondly, the authors refer to a second study as “under review” in the response
letter but cite it as “in press” as reference 21 of the actual manuscript – please
reconcile. Regardless, though, I do not see how the manner in which this work is
cited (lines 92, 194) provides any information to strengthen the argument about
similarity of developmental rate across individuals.
RESPONSE: The citations for Reference 21 (lines 92 & 194) are correct - this paper
has now been published and the citation is updated accordingly. The information to
strengthen our argument about similarity of developmental rate (lines 191-194) refers
to reference 39, which is currently being re-reviewed after revision (we have listed it
as “under consideration” in the reference list).
As a minor point, the abstract may need a final polish as well. On line 15
“cyclorrhaphan” should not be capitalized, and the phrase “dramatic metamorphosis
from legless larva to winged adult” is repeated almost verbatim in the first paragraph
of the introduction.
RESPONSE: Thank you for pointing this out - we have revised the Abstract.
