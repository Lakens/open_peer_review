The authors have addressed most of my points from the earlier review. However, two
weaknesses still remain that must be addressed:
1) Giving timing information only for one case is better than nothing, but not sufficient. Please
also add runtime information for other cases with different trajectory numbers. I would give this
information for all cases considered in the synthetic tests and in Figs. 4 though 6, along with the
respective number of trajectories. This will allow potential users to see how the time scales with
trajectory number and estimate the expected runtime for their own dataset.
2) I still cannot find any information in the manuscript about system requirements and software
availability. This is essential information for the readers. Whom should they contact in order to
get the software? Is the software freely available nor not? What system do I need in order to run
the software? Do I need Matlab (expensive), or is Octave also fine? Do I need particular Matlab
toolboxes? Please add such information about method availability to the manuscript.

Review comments for “Automated Single Particle Detection and Tracking for Large Microscopy
Datasets”. Second review.
Summary: The authors describe a system for tracking thousands of particles in time-lapse
microscopy images. The results are compared to tracking solutions from the ISBI particle tracking
challenge (2012), and also for an experimental dataset.
Comments:
1. The authors included the software as a supplement to the manuscript. However, the
source code is obfuscated – hidden and inaccessible for evaluation. This is completely
unacceptable. There is also no license included. This makes it impossible to evaluate the method,
or to consider it for reuse. This is a major concern.
2. The authors claim repeatedly that the advantage of their method is the ability to track
tens of thousands of particles. There is no constraint to any of the tracking solutions submitted to
the ISBI challenge on the number of particles that are able to be tracked. In fact, the number of
particles is in no way a predictor of how difficult the tracking applications is, although the
number of particles may or may not be a factor in execution time.
Without the source code, the only observation that can be made is that the tracking algorithm is
implemented in MATLAB code. Even with the parallel toolkit, this is very unlikely to be a
particularly high performance implementation as compared to C or C++ implementations used
by at least some of the other ISBI solutions.

thank the reviewers for their comments and have provided our responses in the following.

authors have addressed most of my points from the earlier review. However, two
aknesses still remain that must be addressed:
Giving timing information only for one case is better than nothing, but not sufficient. Please
o add runtime information for other cases with different trajectory numbers. I would give this
rmation for all cases considered in the synthetic tests and in Figs. 4 through 6, along with
respective number of trajectories. This will allow potential users to see how the time scales
h trajectory number and estimate the expected runtime for their own dataset.
We have now added this information and also included an explanation that the
runtimes will vary from user to user as they will be affected by many conditions such
as computer specification and operating conditions not only the data under
investigation. The information regarding runtimes has been added in 5 different
places within the manuscript, addressing the different aspects of the comment:
Lines 192-201
3.5 Software
The software for running the tracking method is included in the supplementary
materials accompanying this paper. The software is currently implemented in Matlab
(Mathworks, Cambridge) with the image processing toolbox and is run through a
single line command in the command window, it will run faster with parallel
processing toolbox, although this is not essential. The software was provided as
executable p-code, the user interface of the software provides step by step guidance
for users to run the software. They can run the software to reproduce all the results
in the manuscript and are able to import their datasets and produce their own results
for evaluation. The runtimes stated in this manuscript are for a standard laptop
computer running Microsoft Windows 8 with 16GB of memory and a 2.4GHz Intel i5
processor utilizing Matlabs parallel processing toolbox with 4 workers. We note that
implementation of our algorithm in higher level programming languages such as C
or C++ will result in a better computational performance. However, we have focused
this paper primarily on the efficiency of the method, so it will run comparatively
efficiently in other implementations.
Lines 226-230
We note the processing time of the method varies with the particle density and SNR
of the dataset being investigated. For the low density datasets with 500 tracks, the
runtime varied from 21 to 72 seconds with the runtime increasing as the SNR
decreases. For the medium density datasets with 2,500 tracks the runtime varied
from 85 to185 seconds. Finally, for high density datasets with 5,000 tracks the
runtime varied from 191 to 384 seconds.
Line 263-265
The runtime for our software on this exemplar dataset with around 1,500 tracks was
202 seconds which is consistent with the runtimes from the synthetic data previously
examined.
Lines 276-279
Particles were detected in all frames using our new particle detection algorithm and
a little over 4,000 tracks subsequently formed using our linking framework with the
total processing time of the dataset being around 15 minutes, which is consistent
with the times previously mentioned for the synthetic ISBI Challenge data.
Lines 303-305
A dataset of this size took approximately 6 hours to process and analyses. A total of
more than 200,000 tracks were found, these can be seen overlaid in Fig. 6a.
still cannot find any information in the manuscript about system requirements and software
ilability. This is essential information for the readers. Whom should they contact in order to
the software? Is the software freely available nor not? What system do I need in order to run
software? Do I need Matlab (expensive), or is Octave also fine? Do I need particular Matlab
lboxes? Please add such information about method availability to the manuscript.
As pointed out above the software was provided as a supplementary file to the
manuscript and additional information on software and its implementation has been
provided in the above.

mments:
The authors included the software as a supplement to the manuscript. However, the

cceptable. There is also no license included. This makes it impossible to evaluate the
thod, or to consider it for reuse. This is a major concern.
The software was provided as executable p-code, the user interface of the software
provides step by step guidance for users to run the software. They can run the
software to reproduce all the results in the manuscript and are able to import their
datasets and produce their own results for evaluation. This information has been
provided in section 3.5 Software. A statement has also been included in the data
accessibility section regarding the source code.
The authors claim repeatedly that the advantage of their method is the ability to track tens
housands of particles. There is no constraint to any of the tracking solutions submitted to the
I challenge on the number of particles that are able to be tracked. In fact, the number of
ticles is in no way a predictor of how difficult the tracking applications is, although the
mber of particles may or may not be a factor in execution time.
The tracking accuracy of an algorithm depends on particle density and SNR and this
is why the ISBI challenge data has a range of densities and SNRs. The full results of
our method are given in the paper together with the runtimes.
hout the source code, the only observation that can be made is that the tracking algorithm is
lemented in MATLAB code. Even with the parallel toolkit, this is very unlikely to be a
ticularly high performance implementation as compared to C or C++ implementations used
at least some of the other ISBI solutions.
We agree with this review that implementation in higher level programming
languages such as C or C++ will result in a better computational performance.
However, we have focused this paper primarily on the efficiency of the method, so it
will run comparatively efficiently in other implementations. This information has been
included in 3.5 Software.
