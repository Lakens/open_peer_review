Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The manuscript seems thorough and well presented. The authors clearly worked to revise in the
light of the more extensive comments by the first referee. I think this will be a well-regarded
manuscript, hopefully moving the field closer to a mechanistic understanding of
magnetoreception.

Dear Dr Shaw:
It is a pleasure to accept your manuscript entitled "Multi-modal imaging and analysis in the
search for iron-based magnetoreceptors in the honey bee Apis mellifera" in its current form for
publication in Royal Society Open Science. The comments of the reviewer(s) who reviewed your
