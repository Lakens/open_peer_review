I am very enthusiastic about this research endeavor in principle, and the methods that have been
chosen to pursue it. The authors are correct that we lack good online tasks to assess statistical
language learning, especially in childhood. The task appears to be well designed and the analyses
and power are appropriate.
My only concern is that this task is being designed for eventual use to study individual
differences. To be meaningful in an individual-difference framework, it should provide reliable
results, such that individuals perform similarly across administration of the same (or similar)
tasks. It should also provide sufficient variance across participants to measure individual
differences (rather than noise). The proposed correlational analysis with working memory is one
approach to determining whether there are meaningful individual differences in this task. But
given the goal of this study, it would have been nice to see some way of measuring the stability of
the findings as well. Perhaps this is considered to be part of the next step in this research
program.

Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript. The main goal – to develop a novel task
to explore sensitivity to different transitional probabilities as well as both adjacent and non
adjacent regularities in the same task – is worthy. However, there are quite a few statements in
the ms that are incorrect or misguided. I think it would be beneficial for the authors to review the
literature more carefully and provide evidence of a comprehensive understanding of this body of
work in the ms. This may lead to significant reconsideration of certain statements, their
hypotheses, and possibly even affect task design.
Abstract
The opening sentence is not accurate. A number of studies have now been conducted that
examine the link between statistical learning and grammatical learning in children. Curiously,
none of these are cited in the ms.
The second sentence is also a little misleading. Related to my point above, there are quite a few
studies with children and, thus, quite a few child-friendly tasks have been developed. Why is this
body of work not acknowledged and not being used to inform this current work?
I am not sure why the task is not being trialled with children when the ultimate goal seems to be
3
to learn about statistical learning in children. Why not just trial it with children in the first
instance (rather than adults)?
The last sentence is problematic and, again, seems to indicate lack of awareness of some previous
work in this area. In fact, researchers who have created statistical learning tasks have gone to
some trouble to demonstrate that their tasks do not correlate with measures of explicit short term
memory (as assessed by digit span tasks and perhaps better described as verbal working
memory? or phonological rehearsal?). In attempting to demonstrate that their tasks measure
implicit statistical learning, researchers have been keen to show that there is no correlation with
explicit tasks of short term memory.
Introduction
Lines 102-105. There are now many studies that have reported links between statistical learning
and language impairment (far more than the single study which has been cited). It is not clear
why this particular study was cited and all the others, including significant meta-analyses, not
cited.
Sentence beginning line 105 suggests that the creation of a “child-friendly and motivating” task of
statistical learning is a novel pursuit. This is not accurate. I encourage the authors to review all of
the previous studies on statistical learning in children. I advise the authors to focus on why their
task is different to all of the others reported in the literature rather than trying to claim they are
the first to create a child-friendly task. I think their task is a little different to others, as the
comparison with the work of Gomez explains. The authors don’t need to make these blanket
statements about novelty.
Line 118-121. This statement about the advantage of using real words over nonwords strikes me
as a little odd. All real words are effectively nonwords until children learn them successfully, are
they not? Perhaps one of the reasons researchers have used nonwords rather than real words in
previous studies is to avoid the myriad of variables that affect processing of real words
(frequency, age of acquisition, imageability etc etc).
Line 144-147. There are ways to assess whether learning has occurred during a test phase. In any
case, surely this learning during the test phase is not a problem so long as the learning applies
equally to previously presented items and foil items?
Was Mysiak et al the first study to use an SRT task? I’m not sure if that is what the authors are
asserting?
Line 168: Previous studies have manipulated TPs. The authors should review these studies and
include information about them in the ms (eg Evans et al, 2009). The authors cite Pelucchi et al
but don’t mention their manipulation of TPs. These authors are not the first to manipulate TPs.
Also, the authors may want to revisit/explain their terminology here?…they refer to
deterministic (TP=1) and probabilistic (TP =.5). This is not an incorrect description but other
studies simply refer to manipulating TPs.
Line 173: many child studies of SL have used responses that do not involve motor pattern
learning. The authors seem to be suggesting that their thinking and their task is novel in this
regard but this is not accurate.
Line 194: as I noted earlier I think the authors might be a little misguided in hypothesizing a
correlation between their statistical learning task and an explicit task of short term memory
(perhaps more accurately described as verbal working memory?). A number of previous studies
4
that have examined whether statistical learning is related to other skills have been overlooked.
Moreover, the reference supplied (23) may be mis-cited as that paper suggests a far less simple
scenario than what these authors suggest in the current ms.
Method
It is not clear why the power analyses cannot be based on previous studies in this area. I
appreciate that this particular task has not been used before but surely (some of) the previous
studies offer some guidance?
I would suggest that the standard variables known to affect children’s processing of words be
investigated with regard to stimuli for the statistical learning task. Eg what is the frequency, age
or acquisition, imageability of these items? If these variables don’t matter explain why not.
However, I expect they do matter because they could affect learnability of certain items and
certain sets of items. So it is important to look at these variables for each individual item but also
in terms of the co-occurring items. Is it important to examine the pictures in terms of name
agreement? Why/why not? All stimuli should be supplied in an Appendix to enable closer
inspection.
Further Reading to Inform Introduction, Hypothesis, and Task Development
I think it best to leave the authors to search for relevant articles on statistical learning in typically
developing children and in those with language disorders but here is a selection of studies they
could start with (not an exhaustive list). Note that some of these previous studies focused on the
link between statistical learning and grammatical learning which appears to be of particular
interest to these authors.

The current registered report outlines the development of a novel online auditory statistical
learning (SL) task, using a serial search paradigm. The design includes a manipulation of the
distance of the to-be-learned dependencies (adjacent / non-adjacent) and their extent of
6
predictability (regular / quasi-regular) as a mean of task validation, and an estimation of the
correlation between performance in this task and working memory.
Overall, I believe that this is a well-designed research proposal, which will potentially provide a
very useful tool for the online investigation of auditory SL abilities. I do have, however, a few
suggestions/concerns regarding the design and analysis, which I hope will help in shaping the
fine details of the task.
First, my biggest concern has to do with the number of stimuli in each condition: All conditions
consist of only one or two triplets. This seems to be problematic especially in light of the use of
real words, which might lead to item-specific effects. The authors are indeed aware of this
possible confound, as they plan to use “seven routines of dependencies” (p. 11). This however
deals with the issue only at the group-level, but does not prevent the added error noise at the
individual-level (as each participant is exposed only to one of these seven experimental lists). I
suggest therefore to include several triplets in each condition (counter-balanced or randomized
across participants), in order to decrease the effect of these possible item-specific effects.
Relatedly, I understand the authors’ motivation in examining multiple factors in the same task.
However, given my first concern above, I recommend that as a first step, they will separate the
investigation of the effect of adjacency and that of predictability into two different experiments.
This way they will be able to increase the number of stimuli in each condition while keeping the
overall length of the task reasonable.
Second, I recommend adding an estimation of the reliability and validity of the new online
measure. Validity can be estimated through the correlation between the online measure and
offline test performance. Even though one would not expect a perfect offline-online correlation
(given possible confounds in the offline test) there should still be quite a lot of shared variance
between the two. Reliability can be estimated using a split-half procedure - running two models
on odd and even trials from the search task and looking at the within-subject correlation of the
estimated by-subject slopes.
Other minor suggestions:
- What procedure will be done to ensure no reliable visual information is to be found across
trials? That is, to ensure that it is not possible to learn the transitional probabilities between the
visual stimuli, even without exposure to the auditory material, solely based on the sequence of
presented pictures across trials?
- Page 14: why is the dependent variable in the mixed models the median RT, and not simply the
RT in each trial (with a fixed effect for trial number)?
- Pages 15-16: It seems that the authors plan to use the by-subject random slope for block as an
individual-level measure of learning, but this seems problematic as this slope examines not only
SL but also the overall decrease in RT over time (regardless of grammaticality condition). Instead,
I would add to the model a by-subject random slope for the grammaticality by block interaction,
which can then serve as a ‘cleaner’ measure of SL (as larger decrease in RT over time to
grammatical compared to ungrammatical trials reflects better SL).
- If indeed the authors plan to add more stimuli in each condition, it will also enable the
estimation of the individual-level correlation between learning adjacent and non-adjacent
dependencies, which speaks to the question of SL as a unified, versus a componential, ability.
- I could not find Appendix 1 - I think that it was not attached to the submission.

Three expert reviewers have now assessed the manuscript. Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 3 are
generally very positive, recommending acceptance following minor revision, and offering
numerous valuable suggestions for improving and optimising the design, including deeper
8
consideration of reliability and validity. Reviewer 2 is more negative and recommends that the
submission be rejected. Among the major concerns raised by the reviewer is an apparent neglect
of relevant literature that could help motivate the proposed design and justify several
methodological choices (nothing that the reviewer helpfully provides a non-exhaustive list of
relevant literature). Notwithstanding the severity of the appraisal by Reviewer 2, given the
positive appraisals by Reviewer 1 and 3 the authors are invited to submit a major revision that
comprehensively addresses all concerns raised.

trials? That is, to ensure that it is not possible to learn the transitional probabilities between the
visual stimuli, even without exposure to the auditory material, solely based on the sequence of
presented pictures across trials?
- Page 14: why is the dependent variable in the mixed models the median RT, and not simply the
RT in each trial (with a fixed effect for trial number)?
- Pages 15-16: It seems that the authors plan to use the by-subject random slope for block as an
individual-level measure of learning, but this seems problematic as this slope examines not only
SL but also the overall decrease in RT over time (regardless of grammaticality condition). Instead,
I would add to the model a by-subject random slope for the grammaticality by block interaction,
which can then serve as a ‘cleaner’ measure of SL (as larger decrease in RT over time to
grammatical compared to ungrammatical trials reflects better SL).
- If indeed the authors plan to add more stimuli in each condition, it will also enable the
estimation of the individual-level correlation between learning adjacent and non-adjacent
dependencies, which speaks to the question of SL as a unified, versus a componential, ability.
- I could not find Appendix 1 - I think that it was not attached to the submission.

Major revision
Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
The revised manuscript is improved. The authors have addressed many of my comments and
comments from the other reviewers. A more comprehensive literature review is provided,
however, there remain some gaps in coverage. In addition, the authors remain a little too quick to
dismiss research that has come before. Their task is clearly novel in some ways. It detracts from
their message to claim that their task is novel in every way.
Referencing: are there some errors in the author’s use of a numbered reference list? For example, I
struggled to find where [23] was cited in the text – did I miss it somewhere in the text? I’m not
going to go through the ref list and check every single ref but there might be multiple errors and
the authors might like to do a thorough check?
I offer a few additional suggestions which could be addressed in a revision. I hope these
comments are helpful.
(1)
Page 4:“As noted above, research to date has established that statistical learning is an important
kind of implicit learning that is likely to be involved in language acquisition, and indeed some
studies have reported associations between indices of statistical learning and language
acquisition [e.g., 15] and language impairment (e.g., [16]). There are, however, difficulties in
adapting experimental tasks for children, because long sessions responding to meaningless
material are not engaging. Although researchers have had some success in designing child-
friendly tasks these have focused mainly on offline measures. More recently, concerns have been
expressed about the poor reliability of statistical learning measures obtained with children [18],
with the suggestion that boredom or fatigue may affect performance, even when child-friendly
materials are used.”
This content is problematic and I invite the authors to revise this section.
First, do the authors have evidence that the tasks used in child studies [15] and [16] were long,
meaningless, and not engaging? For example, the authors state that their proposed new task will
be around 30 minutes in duration. How does this compare with the length of the tasks in all of
the previous child studies that have been cited in this section? There are brief statistical learning
tasks reported in published child studies that are well under 30 minutes in duration so it difficult
to see how this proposed new task is ground breaking in terms of length. As I mentioned in my
14
review of the original submission, there is enough novelty in the new task proposed by the
authors, that tackles different types of statistical regularities in a single task, without overstating
matters. Page 8 lines 183-190 captures this nicely and the Introduction would flow better if was
this was the key message to emerge after a review of previous research in the field.
Second, the study by West et al looked at reliability of some particular types of statistical learning
tasks – they did not look at the reliability of all types of statistical learning tasks and they did not
examine many common types of statistical learning tasks that have been used with infants and
children over several decades (and did not examine the reliability of the tasks cited in this section
of the revised manuscript or the type of task that the authors themselves have proposed). To
avoid misleading readers I suggest that the authors name the types of statistical learning tasks
that were assessed by West et al and acknowledge these as only a small subset of the range of
statistical learning tasks that have been published (and perhaps distinguish them from other
types of statistical learning tasks used in other child studies that the authors have cited in this
section for the sake of clarity).
If this statement is to remain please provide evidence to support it: “boredom or fatigue may
affect performance even when child-friendly materials are used”. I remind the authors that
statistical learning tasks vary widely and that West et al used only a small subset of statistical
learning tasks in their study – so if this statement relates to those particular tasks used by West et
al this should be made clear for the reader.
(2)
In the section on online vs offline learning the authors might see fit to reference studies of
children and adults that have used neurophysiological measures to assess online learning during
statistical learning tasks. I had hoped the authors might uncover some of this work when I
invited them to undertake a more thorough review of the extant literature (although I listed many
references in my review of the original submission I stated that this was by no means an
exhaustive list). I would estimate that 10 or more studies have used neurophysiological measures
to assess online learning, including child and adult studies. Some of these studies include
measures of both online and offline learning – simply pairing commonly used statistical learning
paradigms with neurophysiological measures during a familiarization phase followed by
behavioural testing during a subsequent test phase. The authors cite a reference at 23 in their ref
list which might be relevant here but I struggled to see where it was cited in the text (in any case
it is only one of a number of studies that seem relevant to this section). In fact, we know quite a
bit about online learning of statistical regularities from studies conducted to date and this should
be acknowledged. I do not advocate replacing all narrative reviews with systematic reviews but
one would hope that authors are open to more comprehensive searches when suggested during
peer review.
(3)
Page 7, line 147: some points are not convincing. I suggest that the authors consider revising this
section.
For example, this point is problematic: “First, they confound effects of encoding efficiency and
memory constraints with statistical learning. Thus poor performance at test phase of an offline
task could simply reflect weak ability to remember individual stimuli.”
Theoretically speaking, if the authors are proposing that statistical learning might assist language
acquisition presumably they hold the view that learning must carry over time and involve
‘memory’? How could statistical learning assist language acquisition if all learning was
immediate and fleeting? Moreover, this claim seems at odds with the fact that the authors’
proposed new task includes the kind of offline test phase that has been used in many previous
15
studies – clearly the authors see some value in this type of test phase or they wouldn’t include in
in their own task?
Also, some empirical research has looked at this particular issue of remembering individual items
vs co-occurring items and found it not to be an issue in commonly used statistical learning tasks
(eg see Sigurdardottir et al, 2017, Scientific Reports).
This point is also problematic: “Third, to get sufficient information, offline tasks use the two-
alternative forced choice method, where it is necessary to repeatedly present test items and foils.
This can cause interference, thereby blurring the methodological separation between intended
learning during familiarization and unintended learning during the test phase.”
I am not quite sure what the authors have in mind here but I suspect that this issue has been
addressed to some extent in previous research. For example, one way to look at possible learning
during a test phase is to compare performance on the first half vs second half of test trials or look
at consistency of responding across test trials in other ways.
(4)
The authors’ directional hypothesis regarding a link between their new learning task and
working memory remains problematic. The authors cite a paper by Janacsek and Nemeth (2013). I
am not sure how they derived their directional hypothesis based on that review paper. Reading a
follow up paper by the same authors (2015) might also be illuminating. Note the final paragraph
in the 2015 paper “In summary, the relationship between WM and SL is quite complicated and
can widely differ based on several factors. In our review paper (Janacsek & Nemeth, 2013) we
attempted to move away from the traditional research approach that aims to relate WM to all
cognitive functions (including SL), often leading to oversimplified conclusions about these
relationships. Instead, in order to understand the neurocognitive background of these functions,
we suggested to think about the relationship between WM and SL in a more sophisticated way by
exploring what factors can influence this relationship, and in which cases we can find no or even
negative correlation between WM and SL.”
If the authors wish to use these citations, perhaps they would like to reconsider a directional
hypotheses and instead put forward the possibility of a variety of outcomes? I don’t think this
would take detract from their paper in any way.
(5)
In my view, the insistence throughout the Introduction that using words as stimuli to assess this
kind of learning is superior to using nonwords just doesn’t hold up. For example, in one of their
claims about words being better than nonwords for this purpose, the authors claim that children
first learn words then learn grammar. I think many would argue that word learning continues for
a very long time once grammar learning has begun. And children can apply grammatical rules to
nonsense words. There are other reasons put forward for why words are superior to nonwords
and they don’t really hold up either. Why is it necessary to make these kinds of claims? The most
obvious reason why the authors want to use words rather than nonwords is because their task
includes the use of pictures – why not simply state this and remove the other questionable
claims?
(6)
Page 19. Treatment of outliers likely requires a little more justification. For example, why is there
blanket recoding of RTs greater than 2000ms to 2000ms? How many data points is this likely to
16
represent? Is this likely to be an issue when it comes to using this task with children? These issues
ought to be considered given the authors’ repeated claim throughout the paper that their aim is
to devise a test that is appropriate for use with children.
(7)
Page 22 at 2.3.4: could the authors include a reference for using a correlation coefficient of .65 as
evidence of adequate test-retest reliability? Also, the authors might like to consider whether an
overall index of learning for all the grammatical sequences is adequate or whether it could
perhaps be supplemented by more fine-grained analyses of test-retest reliability for the different
types of statistical regularities included in this single task.
Comments in the response letter:
Listed under Abstract
(2)
Yes, the proposed task is novel in the types of reinforcement offered and this is an interesting
feature. But many other studies have found ways to engage children. For instance, many studies
have used cover tasks. These cover tasks serve multiple purposes including engagement. I’m
curious as to whether the authors are unaware of this or reluctant to acknowledge it for some
reason? Acknowledging this does not take away from their study.
(3)
In my view, the response here provides even more reason why it would be wise to trial the new
task on children first and then extend it to adults. However, all I can do is suggest that their work
may be more powerful if they trial this new task on children first via this pre-registered study, or
at least include both children and adults in this trial. If the authors don’t want to do this then so
be it.
Listed under Introduction
(1)
I won’t comment on the reference to an unpublished study because I am not familiar with that
unpublished work. More generally, my view is that private discussions among authors and
reviewers during the review process regarding unpublished studies are not helpful for the
broader scientific community. Peer review is far from perfect but we do rely on it which is of
course why the authors, themselves, make the point about citing published studies. The authors
should decide for themselves whether or not to cite the published meta-reviews and meta-
analyses. However, if they don’t cite them the authors may risk appearing uninformed. If the
authors have a specific and valid criticism of these meta studies they could state that alongside
citation.
(6)
Yes, I am aware of the context in which Pelucchi et al was cited. However, if Pelucchi et al also
looked at TPs it would be prudent to reference this in the section on previous studies of TPs along
side the Evans et al study. I am confused as to why the authors would not want to do this and are
them to reconsider.

I agree with the changes made by the authors and recommend the acceptance of this revised

addition of the test-retest procedure will shed light on many of the issues raised in the previous
round. I am looking forward to see the full results!
Below I list a few additional minor issues to be considered by the authors:
- abstract (line 5) I think that stating that the main goal of the study is to estimate “effect size
indices” is a bit misleading as most of this study is devoted to the development of a new task, not
specifically to effect size estimation.
- analysis section (p. 19): I find the regression discontinuity approach very intriguing. Could you
add references to previous works using this approach (specifically from SRT studies, or from
individual differences research?). Also, given its novelty, perhaps it would be better to have
another (online) measure of individual-differences in learning (e.g., simple RT differences/ log-
RT differences between experimental and random conditions). This will enable the validation of
this interesting method.
- offline measure analysis (p. 20): if I understand correctly, on p. 18 the authors offer to score the
probabilistic condition as correct only if both trials are correct, while the deterministic conditions
only have one trial (scored 0/1). Wouldn't this reduce the chance of success in the probabilistic
condition, without any relation to SL processes?

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
Your revised manuscript was returned to Reviewer 2 for a final Stage 1 assessment. The reviewer
elected to not make comments to authors but conveyed dissatisfication with the manuscript via
comments to the editor and recommended Reject. While we cannot transmit these comments, the
dissatisifaction stemmed primarily from a disagreement about the strength and generality of
claims made in the introduction concerning specific papers. After consulting among the editorial
team we feel that some of the remaining concerns are matters of interpretation, while others are
best addressed through a final minor revision as outlined below, which will not require further
in-depth review before IPA. While we agree that the Introduction should be as balanced as
possible, and we do not wish to disregard the recommendations of this expert reviewer, the
Registered Reports editor and Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience editor also agreed that the
study sufficiently meets the remaining Stage 1 criteria to be offered in principle acceptance,
taking into account their own assessments and the assessments of the other two reviewers.
In order to achieve IPA, we would be grateful if you could attend to the following points:
p4: "Although researchers have had some success in designing offline child-friendly tasks (e.g.,
[19]), these involve a multiple-choice format with a relatively small number of items; although
25
this method can be useful for documenting influences of age and other manipulations, it is likely
to be insensitive to individual differences." This statement should be qualified given that
reference [9] using the same or similar method appears to provide evidence of sensitivity to
individual differences.
p4: " There are, however, difficulties in adapting implicit online statistical learning paradigms for
children, because most online tasks involve repetitive responding to visual sequences (see Serial
Reaction Time tasks [17,18]) and long sequences of meaningless material are not engaging."
Please clarify this statement given that the cited references in this case involved published studies
with children.
Finally, on different note please correct the following referencing errors and check the references
carefully for other errors.

Decision letter (RSOS-171678)
20-Oct-2017
Dear Dr Kuppuraj
On behalf of the Editor, I am pleased to inform you that your Manuscript RSOS-171678 entitled
"Online incidental statistical learning of audiovisual word sequences in adults - a registered
report" has been accepted in principle for publication in Royal Society Open Science. The
reviewers' and editors' comments are included at the end of this email.
You may now progress to Stage 2 and complete the study as approved. We would be grateful if
you could now update the journal office as to the anticipated completion date of your study.
At this point we would also ask that you deposit the approved Stage 1 submission, unchanged
from its current state, on the Open Science Framework (OSF) or other recognised registry. This
will ensure that there is a public, verifiable and discoverable record (with doi) of the approved
protocol independent of the journal. Should you have concerns about publishing your approved
Stage 1 protocol at this time, e.g. due to potential risk of your methods being scooped, the OSF
26
offers the option to register the protocol privately under an embargo which you can then lift
when the study is complete.
Following completion of your study, we invite you to resubmit your paper for peer review as a
Stage 2 Registered Report, including in the manuscript a link (URL) to the accepted Stage 1
protocol on the OSF or other recognised registry, which should by this point be made fully
public. Please note that your manuscript can still be rejected for publication at Stage 2 if the
Editors consider any of the following conditions to be met:
• The results were unable to test the authors’ proposed hypotheses by failing to meet the
approved outcome-neutral criteria
• The authors altered the Introduction, rationale, or hypotheses, as approved in the Stage 1
submission
• The authors failed to adhere closely to the registered experimental procedures
• Any post-hoc (unregistered) analyses were either unjustified, insufficiently caveated, or overly
dominant in shaping the authors’ conclusions
• The authors’ conclusions were not justified given the data obtained
We encourage you to read the complete guidelines for authors concerning Stage 2 submissions at
http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/registered-reports. Please especially note the
requirements for data sharing and that withdrawing your manuscript will result in publication of
a Withdrawn Registration.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your stage 2 submission. If you have any questions at all, please do not
hesitate to get in touch. We look forward to hearing from you shortly with the anticipated
submission date for your stage two manuscript.
Kind regards,
Alice Power

This task is novel in important ways and the study has been conducted appropriately. There are a
few issues to be addressed that will strengthen the paper and ensure it has maximum impact.
The paper spends a great deal of time explaining why it is vital to explore different types of
regularities in a single task. However, the test-retest reliability measure is a global index
(collapsed across different types of regularities). By all means report the global index but please
report reliability for the different types of regularities so that this paper can have the fullest
impact. Readers will be wanting to know if test-retest reliability differs for the different types of
regularities given that the Introduction primes them to expect this information and results show
differences in learning for these different regularities “adjacent deterministic were easiest, then
adjacent probabilistic, then non-adjacent deterministic.”
The authors went to some trouble in the Introduction to explain why it is important to assess
online learning over and above offline learning. However, their results revealed a correlation
between online and offline learning (r = .80). A paragraph needs to be inserted into the
Discussion explaining what they think of this correlation. Does this provide some evidence that
online and offline measures assess the very same learning thereby allaying the concerns they
expressed in the Introduction?
Page 32 lines 744-749 are problematic. The statement “To our knowledge this is the first online SL
task that uses meaningful items” and following sentence should be deleted, in my opinion. The
authors have chosen to argue that using words rather than nonwords is a strength of their design
but many would argue otherwise…it is a weak claim and is not necessary. I think it detracts from
the many positive aspects of their design. Stating “One of the objectives was to develop a SL task
that could be motivating and fun for children” implies that other research involved tasks that
were not motivating and fun for children. Why would the authors want to imply this? They have
not tested this claim by comparing the amount of ‘fun’ that children have doing this novel task by
comparison with all the previous tasks that have ever been conducted (nor would this be a very
interesting research question to pursue, in my opinion). The statement “Further, given the
concerns surrounding poor reliability of SL tasks that are used in children [see 20] one of our
objectives was to examine the test-retest reliability of our novel SL task.” As stated in an earlier
review, the authors should be clear that the West et al study reported on a very specific subset of
SL tasks…they did not undertake a comprehensive study of the reliability of all SL tasks. Thus,
this statement should be clarified. Statements in the Introduction were clarified accordingly – the
authors are invited to apply the same clarity to statements in the Discussion. Moreover, the West
et al study discussed reliability issues in terms of consistency of responding within tasks as well
as test-retest reliability. Perhaps the authors would like to provide readers with data on the
internal consistency within their novel task (for each type of regularity). I think readers would
find this valuable. Given the novel task reported here uses words rather than nonwords (and we
know that words can differ in so many ways that can affect responding) it would be especially
useful to know about consistency of responding.
28
The authors found that their novel task did not correlate with a measure of STM. This is not
surprising and has been reported in a number of studies (more than the single study referenced
by the authors).

Comments to the Author(s)

I was excited to read the full manuscript and was glad to see that the data supported the authors'
predictions. I believe that this work advances Statistical Learning research both methodologically
and theoretically. Methodologically, the new paradigm the authors developed can be useful in
future investigations of SL, given its high reliability and validity (and its potential applicability
with children). Theoretically, the authors add to a growing literature comparing the
computations underlying the assimilation of different types of statistical regularities.
I only have one more major suggestion for further clarification of the results and discussion. As
the authors note, one major advantage of online measures is that they track the dynamics of
learning – that is, they do not only tap into overall extent of learning, but also estimate when did
learning occur. It was not clear to me, however, whether the results from the regression
discontinuity approach speak to overall extent of learning, or to its dynamics. That is, when the
authors compare the ease/difficulty of learning different types of regularities, by comparing the
coefficients from the regression model in the different conditions, do they compare overall extent
of learning (i.e., whether different conditions show greater effects compared to others, averaged
across time), its dynamics (i.e., whether one condition was learned faster/slower compared to the
others), or both? I think it is important to make this distinction, and to discuss these two issues
separately, in light of the previous accounts of learning adjacent vs. non-adjacent dependencies
that had specific predictions regarding the dynamics of learning. The theoretical promise of the
current work is that it can now actually examine these predictions, with the new online measure.
Other minor suggestions/corrections:
- p. 6 lines 125-126: I do not believe it is true that most SL studies give explicit instructions to
participants (see the original Saffran studies with children and adults). At the very least, I believe
that this is an unnecessary strong claim. Please rephrase, or provide references.
- p. 7 line 164: Please explain what is meant by "to get sufficient information" in the context of 2-
AFC tests.
- p. 12 line 264: omit N.B.
- Methods section: phrasing changes from past to future tense – please go over this section and
correct.
- p. 28: Another possible exploratory analysis that can be done is to look at the within-individual
29
correlations between online performance in the different learning conditions. This would speak to
the question of whether SL is a unified or a componential construct. For example, previous
studies (Romberg & Saffran 2013, Siegelman & Frost 2015) showed no correlation between
learning adjacent and non-adjacent contingencies, as measured by offline tasks. Is this result
replicated with the new online measure?

General concern
Why not non-words?
The text in MS (and in RMS) reads as “First, these [Gomez and Romberg and Saffran] studies used meaningless nonsense syllables. These
materials have many advantages because they allow tight control of experimental stimuli, minimising impact of prior linguistic knowledge.
However, use of familiar words has the advantage that it reduces the need to learn novel words as well as sequential patterns between words, and
so should make a statistical learning task easier, as well as providing more intrinsic interest than meaningless material. In addition, if the aim is
to model statistical learning of grammar, it could be argued that real word stimuli are more relevant than nonwords, because children first learn
words and then learn how they co-occur in sequences”
Justification: Authors agree that on a purely auditory SL task using non-words may be justified as in Gomez and Romberg
and Saffran. However, considering the nature of our learning task where a serial search paradigm is employed, in which
participants are asked to select an object amidst its distractors, using of non-words or associating non-words to abstract
shapes may be too demanding (especially for children). And, it may turn out that learning (deficit) speed may be a
reflection of individual differences in object-word association abilities- a totally different entity of learning than the one
targeted in the present study.

learning (SL) task, using a serial search paradigm.
The design includes a manipulation of the distance of
the to-be-learned dependencies (adjacent / non-

quasi-regular) as a mean of task validation, and an
estimation of the correlation between performance in

Overall, I believe that this is a well-designed research
proposal, which will potentially provide a very useful
tool for the online investigation of auditory SL
abilities. I do have, however, a few
suggestions/concerns regarding the design and
analysis, which I hope will help in shaping the fine
details of the task.

number of exposures. This again resulted in no obvious learning. Third, we presented two
triplets/condition, which again showed no learning. Finally, we presented one
triplet/condition with three grammatical conditions. This showed learning only in adjacent
probabilistic items, which seemed related to the fact that there are two triplets for this
condition with the same initial 2 items, and although we had ensured they were not
presented adjacently, they nevertheless occurred more densely than other sequences. We
therefore settled on the current design, where the probability of the first two items of a
triplet is the same for all three conditions. In 9 pilot participants, we see clear learning in

closer to natural language learning-where dependencies do not come in specific categories
but within the same stream of language.

This more complex design led to complications in specifying the best model for analysis,

one compares the slopes across different phases of the study.

available on OSF (osf.io/342rz) – the estimated random slopes agree very nicely with the
impression from visual inspection of individual plots from pilot data, and we are confident
that this is a meaningful approach that captures what we want.
In addition, we needed a measure per subject to reflect their learning for each sequence
type, and we found that we could fit a regression discontinuity model to individual per-
subject data, to get a t-score that reflects the extent to which the slopes are the same during
the learning and break-sequence phases. We plan to use these estimates in the correlational
studies that we have specified (test/retest and correlation with verbal STM).

be a reflection of individual differences in object-word association abilities- a totally different

As the reviewer accepts, because of the nature of the task words are necessitated in the
paradigm.
We had made this point explicitly in MS-R1: “This also makes it easier to design an online
task, using participants' responses to familiar stimuli.” See lines 110-12 in MS_R2.
We do not disagree that 'word learning continues for a very long time once grammar learning
has begun' – we are simply arguing that if you want to look at learning of sequential
information, it may help to use familiar items in those sequences, as happens in natural
language learning. However, to avoid any misunderstanding we have removed the following
statement from MS_R1 following R2 concern.
“In addition, if the aim is to model statistical learning of grammar, it could be argued that real
word stimuli are more relevant than nonwords, because children first learn words and then

Responses
In view of the concerns raised regarding the reference number 19 we are convinced that our statement was indeed bit misleading and
requires moderation. And, also reference numbers 17 and 18 were the author’s own studies, and it was from these studies we began to
worry about the usefulness of SRT tasks-especially its suitability to study SL in children. Since, the issue is only an opinion, we used
the phrase ‘may not be engaging’ instead of ‘are not engaging’ in our present revised manuscript. Now the lines of interest in page 4
reads as follows
There are, however, difficulties in adapting implicit online statistical learning paradigms for children, because most online tasks
involve repetitive responding to visual sequences (see Serial Reaction Time tasks [17,18]) and long sequences of meaningless material
may not be engaging. Note that researchers have had some success in designing offline child-friendly tasks that were capable of
capturing individual differences (e.g., [19]).
We are thankful for pointing out errors in reference section. We have now corrected them.

estimation process. More specifically, set index was centred at zero, so that the point of discontinuity is
zero. That is, b1 had negative indexes until the discontinuity for the learning phase, but then fixed zero
values after the discontinuity in the break-sequence phase. For the break-sequence phase, b2 variable
was coded as zero prior to discontinuity and positive set values in the break-sequence phase, as is
typical in regression discontinuity design. Our extension to this model is to allow random effects for
individual slopes rather than estimation of only a specific "treatment" effect’

2 Sample size N=40 In Final Report N=42. Reads as
Reads as ‘N.B. We finally included 42 participants as, after in-principle acceptance, we realised we would
need a number divisible by three so the three counter balanced routines (see below) could be given to
equal number of participants’
P.No: 24, Lines: 558-570 This was done as the authors wanted to have a number (N=42) divisible by 3
(i.e., the total number of counterbalanced routines). The Editor was notified about this change. Note
that the change did not alter the results (results reported in manuscript for N=42 can be compared to
results for N=40 in OSF link https://osf.io/zcdva/)
Authors
‘When we did our RR submission, we said we'd test 40 people. This was based on idea we needed a
number divisible by 4 as we had 4 versions of task to counterbalance. However, between earlier
submission and final version, we actually dropped one version, so we only had 3. Since 40 isn't divisible
by 3, Kuppu tested 42, as rounding up seemed preferable to rounding down. But we then realised that if
we report 42 we may get in trouble with you or reviewers, who could think we had done this to push a
result into significance.
The one result we have that is on the border of significance (on test-retest reliability) is just above the
threshold we specified regardless of whether we run the analysis with 40 or 42.
So question is : should we just report on 40 subjects, as we had prespecified, or should we report all 42
and add an explanation about (a) the reason and (b) the fact it doesn't affect significance of findings.
Latter makes it more complicated but we spent time and money testing those people so would be sad to
lose their data!’
Editor response
‘This is fine. You have a methodologically valid reason for the slightly increased sample size that is
independent of the results. So I suggest just reporting the full 42 with a brief explanation in the Methods
reporting the deviation in sample size from the original N=40 and the reasons why the deviation was
necessary (preserving the original power analysis etc but making clear that the required correction was
noticed only after IPA, and reporting the slight increase in power from testing 2 extra participants).
Then, in the pre-registered section of the results, report the outcomes for N=42 but add a footnote
indicating that the statistical significance of the outcomes doesn’t change at the originally specified
N=40 for any of the analyses, referring readers to the online archived data/code (for maximum
robustness, perhaps include in the online archive, but not the paper, an analysis of the original N=40 to
make it easy for reviewers to check consistency if they want to)’
