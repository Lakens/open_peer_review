This is a well written paper with a sound experimental design.
There have been many biochar studies done in paddy soils in China examining both changes in
soil carbon and microbial communities. Please make a table to show what studies have been
done and whether they have found different results to that given in this study. In particular
there have been many studies published using San Li wheat straw biochar. (Joseph et al 2013,
Qian Li et al 2014 etc)
line 103 You must specify what type of biochar and temperature it was made at. Generalisations

The manuscript deals with current issue of biochar application to soil to redistribute CO2 and
improve soil carbon pool. The paper is very well written and the results are novel and valuable
since the utilization of agricultural waste materials such as straw may be a step forward in
protection of natural environment and simultaneous improvement of cultivation soils. However,
the manuscript needs minor corrections before the acceptance:
1) Data presented in tables should be supported by statistical analysis and the “n” value should
be presented in table legends and figure captions,
2) The Introduction is lengthy and should be definitely shortened.

line 82 what is dry combustion. 760C is a very high temperature for biochar. you need to discuss
the role of temperature in changes in soil properties and microbial biomass. Suggest you start
with Joseph et al Shifting paradigms Carbon Management.
You state that few studies have been done Please list all of these studies. Parts of China has a
long history of making and using straw biochar please correct the statement.
There have been many groups who have done greenhouse gas measurements using straw
biochar in China. Please list these. What is novel. Has anyone done studies with tobacco. I have
7
measured the maximum temperature in San Li reactor at approximately 480C. This has been
reported in Joseph et al 2013. Please alter and add the reference.
How does you techniques differ from those used by say genxing Pans Group who have done
extensive greenhouse gas measurement with San Li wheat straw.
Please clarify whether the carbon increases were just due to the addition of the biochar or to the
addition of biochar and fixation. i refer the authors to the study by Weng et al Nature Climate
Change; 7, (5) 371-376
So if total C increased in the soil why did CO2 increase. Where is the extra carbon coming from?
The discussion does not really include the most recent reports on how biochar builds up stable
organo mineral layers. I suggest the authors read Archanjo et al 2(2017) Nanoscale analyses of
the surface structure and composition of biochars extracted from field trials or after co-
composting using advanced analytical electron microscopy. Geoderma . 295,70-79 . Hagemann
,et al. (2017) Organic coating on biochar explains its nutrient retention and stimulation of soil
fertility. Nature Communications 18, 1089 and Weng et al
Who else has found that Lactococcus plays a major role in soil carbon pool and what other
bacteria have other researchers found that increase carbon when biochar is added?

Reviewer #1:
Comment 1: There have been many biochar studies done in paddy soils
in China examining both changes in soil carbon and microbial
communities. Please make a table to show what studies have been
done and whether they have found different results to that given in this
study. In particular there have been many studies published using San
Li wheat straw biochar. (Joseph et al 2013, Qian Li et al 2014 etc)
Response: Thanks for your review and helpful suggestion. We have
already made the table and put it into the discussion part (Lines
333;428-429).
Comment 2: line 103 You must specify what type of biochar and
temperature it was made at. Generalisations don’t help the reader.
Response: Thank you for the comments. The type of biochar and
temperature was specific in current manuscript (Lines 82-83).
Comment 3: Section 2.2 Please give details of the properties of the
biochars, feedstock used and temperature of manufacture and device
used to make the biochar the beginning of this section. There is not
enough data in line 152
Response: Thanks for your review. The details of the properties of the
biochar, feedstock used and temperature of manufacture and device
used were added in the current manuscript (Lines 129-131),and we
moved the details the properties of the biochar to the Table S1.
Comment 4: Line 228 Please state how your method differs from other
methods where GHG emissions were measured (e.g. Qian Li 57. Qian
L., (2014). Biochar compound fertilizer as an option to reach high
productivity but low carbon intensity in rice agriculture of China.
Carbon Management. 5(2):pp 145-158
Response: Thanks for your review. These two methods are kind of
same, but they still have some different. We use different size of static
chamber, what is more, our gas sampling was done at 15d interval while
for Qian’s method the interval was 7d. these changes will reflect on
the formula calculation in our paper.
Comment 5: 3.1.1 I would like to see the data graphed to show the
increase in no biochar C that has built up in the soil. Please see 1.
Weng Z., Van Zwieten L., ., 2017 Biochar builds soil carbon over a
decade by stabilising rhizodeposits; Nature Climate Change; 7, (5) 371-
376
Response: Thanks for your review. This paper is helpful for our research,
however, we did not test the data for no biochar C built up in the soil,
which need to use C13 to achieve it. As a helpful suggestion, we will
adopt this method in our further study.
Comment 6: The aromatic carbon in wheat straw biochar is not 98.5 %
Please quote the figures in Joseph et al 2013 Carbon Managment
Shifting Paradigms.
Response:Thanks for your review. This reference is very useful, and I
have already added it to revised manuscript (Lines 336-337).
Comment 7: You need to give a more detailed explanation of the role
of Lactococcus in the increase in yield of rice or in the changes in
carbon pools
Response:Thanks for your review and valuable comments. We have
revised this section according to your suggestion. And the detail of the
role of Lactococcus were added in the current manuscript (Lines 394-
398)
Reviewer #2:
Comment 1: Data presented in tables should be supported by
statistical analysis and the “n” value should be presented in table
legends and figure captions.
Response: Thanks for your helpful suggestions. We have already
change the table 2 and put “n” value in table legends and figure
captions(Lines 424;437).
Comment 2: The Introduction is lengthy and should be definitely
shortened.
Response: Thank you for your review and valuable advices. We have
revised this section according to your suggestion. The introduction has
been shortened, and these changes will not influence the content and
framework of the paper.

Reviewer #1:
1 line 82 what is dry combustion. 760C is a very high temperature for
biochar. you need to discuss the role of temperature in changes in soil
properties and microbial biomass. Suggest you start with Joseph et al
Shifting paradigms Carbon Management.
Thanks for your review and helpful suggestion. We made a mistake and
the temperature is 700 <U+2103>, also, we delete the “dry combustion” which
was also used by mistake. However, 700 <U+2103> is also very high for the
biochar, thus we discussed the role of temperature for biochar in
changes in soil properties and microbial biomass, and the reference you
suggested is very helpful and we have added this reference into our
manuscript. (line 82-87)
2 You state that few studies have been done Please list all of these
studies. Parts of China has a long history of making and using straw
biochar please correct the statement.
Thanks for your review, we have already listed the studies and corrected
the statement about the straw biochar making and using in the history
of China. (line 90-93,94-96)
3 There have been many groups who have done greenhouse gas
measurements using straw biochar in China. Please list these. What is
novel. Has anyone done studies with tobacco.
Thanks for your review. There is no study on greenhouse gas in tobacco
field, and we add this statement in the manuscript(line 95-96). Also,
we add the studies using straw biochar in China in table 3.
I have measured the maximum temperature in San Li reactor at
approximately 480C. This has been reported in Joseph et al
2013. Please alter and add the reference.
Thanks for your review. We have added this reference into the
manuscript(line 133-134).
4 How does you techniques differ from those used by say genxing Pans
Group who have done extensive greenhouse gas measurement with San
Li wheat straw.
Thanks for your review. we have made this statement in the paper.
These two methods are kind of same, but we still have some
differencedifferent. We use different size of static chamber, what is
more, our gas sampling was done at 15d interval while for Li’s method
the interval was 7d. these changes will reflect on the formular
calculation in our paper. (line 203-204)
5 Please clarify whether the carbon increases were just due to the
addition of the biochar or to the addition of biochar and fixation. i
refer the authors to the study by Weng et al Nature Climate Change; 7,
(5) 371-376
Thanks for your review and helpful suggestion. We have made clarify
for the carbon increases were not only just due to addition of the
biochar but also biochar fixation. (line 336-343)
6 So if total C increased in the soil why did CO2 increase. Where is the
extra carbon coming from?
Thanks for your review. We believe the carbon comes from the biochar.
Biochar input can directly affect the formation and content of soil
organic matter. This promotion mainly attributes to the contribution of
biochar itself containing stable and unstable components of the organic
matter. Stable components of biochar can stabilize soil carbon pools
when imported into soil and have long-term storage effects1-3, and
unstable component of biochar such as aliphatic compounds can
directly increase the soil organic carbon storage capacity in the solid
form4, 5; aliphatic compounds gradually lose their peripheral structure
and are released into the soil, directly decomposed by soil microbes,
and then converted to MBC and DOM, thereby increasing the organic
carbon pool of soil.
7 The discussion does not really include the most recent reports on how
biochar builds up stable organo mineral layers. I suggest the authors
read Archanjo et al 2(2017) Nanoscale analyses of the surface structure
and composition of biochars extracted from field trials or after co-
composting using advanced analytical electron microscopy. Geoderma .
295,70-79 . and Weng et al
Thanks for your review and helpful suggestion. These papers are very
helpful to us. We have added biochar builds up stable organo mineral
layers to our discussion part, and add these reference into our
manuscript. (line 336-343)
8 Who else has found that Lactococcus plays a major role in soil carbon
pool and what other bacteria have other researchers found that
increase carbon when biochar is added?
Thanks for your review. Except for Hu we mentioned in our manuscript,
Tang found Lactococcus have a close relationship with soil respiration7,
8. Somers research shows soil fertility of organic agricultural soils can be
related to the presence of Lactococcus9. And Hu found Lactococcus
potential impacts on carbon sequestration on wetlands6. And we have
already added to our manuscript (line 400-405). There are also some
bacteria were found increased when biochar added, including
Pseudomonas spp. , Lysobacter spp. 10and Bacillus spp. 11.

Comment 2: They refer to the non aromatic carbon as unstable. This is
not correct as some of the non aromatic warer soluble organic
compounds have similar structures to humic acids and polyphenols. I
would recommend using the term labile
Response: Thank you for the comments. We have already changed the word
“unstable” into “labile”.
