Dear Authors/Editor,
My comments to you both are the same.
Firstly, I completely disagree with the replacement of RQD in rock mass classification systems.
Rock mass classification are simplifications of a very complex, variable system, and RQD has
played a significant role in these for 50+ years. So my question or challenge to you (for the future
- not this paper) is, how do we replace rock mass classifications all together? Or maybe we cannot
in our lifetimes...
The RMR-mbi approach you have presented seems quite reasonable. I would like to see, ideally
in this paper, but possibly in a follow-up, a photograph of a rock mass, say a large rock slope or
large cavern with various structural regions, and your RMR-mbi model generated to simulate
this actual rock mass. How well will it compare to the real thing after a single simulation?
The paper is very interesting; my suggested revisions are as follows:
3
1. You indicate 'a sort of superiority' of RMR-mbi on page 8 or so. I think you need to also
acknowledge the importance of RMR in its original form, in that it has been successfully applied
to thousands of projects around the world. I agree your method is more sophisticated, and
probably more robust, but it has not (yet) been around for 40+ years.
2. With the increased sophistication/complexity, consider discussing 'how long' it takes to
perform a reasonable RMR-mbi assessment. Simple rock mass classification assessments take a
few minutes, perhaps an hour in a local area...
3. In your conclusion you discuss the 'overgeneralisation' of rock mass classifications. I think you
should also mention that your method is also a generalisation but with improvements, it is still
not a true representation of the rock mass.
Again, congratulations on some very interesting work.
Best regards Neil

21 Abstract: In rock engineering projects, professionals assess the overall rock mass qualities using a
22
sole value. However, the true qualities of partial rock masses are incompatible with such a value.
23
24 To address this problem, the idea of regionally classifying rock mass qualities is proposed and the
25 associated procedure presented. To achieve this goal, the probabilistic and deterministic joints
26 within the study area were determined, and a three-dimensional joint network model was created.
27 Then, the three-dimensional joint network model was discretised into interlocking subdomains,
28
29 and the modified blockiness index (MBi) was used to finely identify the homogeneous structural
30 regions, together with the k-means algorithm and the sum of squared errors (SSE). A synthetic
31 model comprising homogeneous structural regions was developed and validated with respect to
32 the extracted cross-sections. Next, an improved Rock Mass Rating system (RMRmbi) was
33
introduced, and the viability of RMRmbi was supported through a significant amount of theoretical
34
35 cases and several real cases. Finally, visualisation of regional RMRmbi classification results was
36 performed. Results show that: (i) the homogeneous structural regions are finely demarcated in
37 three dimensions; and (ii) the proposed idea can overcome the problem of rock mass quality
38 classification using the conventional approach often leading to ‘overgeneralisation’.

43 1. Introduction
44
45 Rock mass quality classification is an auxiliary tool frequently used as an indicator for rock
46
engineering, in which various rock materials and/or rock mass properties are quantified and
47
48 subsequently combined using addition and subtraction [1], multiplication and division [2], etc.,
49 and therefore, the overall quality of a given rock mass can be numerically assessed. A major
50 benefit of such a classification system is that it can provide empirical guidance for designing rock
51 engineering structures (e.g. excavation spans) [3] and also enable the estimation of rock mass
52
53 mechanical properties, e.g. rock mass strength and rock mass deformation modulus [4].
54 Typically, rock mass quality classification results cannot be elaborated to a meter range [5],
55 e.g. a Rock Mass Rating (RMR) value always summarises the average quality of the rock masses

3 in a segment of surrounding tunnel. For rock engineering projects (e.g. a rock dam or underground
4 opening), engineers often assess the overall rock mass quality using a sole value, which, as in this
5
case, may be problematic as the true qualities of the partial rock masses are incompatible with
6
7 such a value. Some investigations have been undertaken to address this problem, e.g. Shang et al.
8 [6] regionalised rock masses through engineering geological rock groupings in conjunction with
9 lithologies and then conducted rock mass quality ratings in different regions. However,
10 lithological regionalisation does not consider rock mass structure, and even if the lithologies are
11
identical or similar, rock mass qualities vary with different degrees of rock mass jointing.
12
13 Objectively, a guideline should be followed when rock mass quality classification is conducted, i.e.
14 regionalising rock masses and then classifying rock mass qualities. Because lithological
15 regionalisation is slightly insufficient, the authors believe that the homogeneous structural region
16
[7] (a further geological zoning) may be more appropriate, i.e. identifying rock mass
17
18 homogeneous structural regions then classifying rock mass qualities.
19 Many existing identification methods of homogeneous structural regions zone engineer rock
20 mass from a two-dimensional perspective, i.e. a rock outcrop, and utilise the joint data measured
21 in daylighting rock masses, including joint orientation and joint density, to divide a given rock
22
mass into different domains together with statistical knowledge. These existing methods mostly
23
24 focus on small-scale joints (a trace length of approximately 4 m or shorter) [8, 9], which are
25 widely used in hydraulics, particularly the creation of a Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) model
26 and the subsequent seepage analysis. However, in these existing methods, some large-scale joints
27
(e.g. incipient discontinuities, minor faults, and bedding planes) are always ignored or defined as
28
29 the presumptive boundaries of a homogeneous structural region [10, 11]. Therefore, the existing
30 methods cannot consider the implications of large-scale joints.
31 Additionally, some traditional rock mass quality classification systems, such as RMR 1, are
32 limited in terms of quantification of the degree of jointing, i.e. the incorporation of Rock Quality
33
Designation (RQD) [12], which is frequently used in the rock engineering field but has some
34
35 drawbacks as follows [13, 14]: (i) RQD only counts the core pieces longer than 100 mm and fails
36 to consider the effect of block size [15]; and (ii) the RQD value is sensitive to orientation (i.e.
37 orientation bias). Lowson et al. [4] recommended replacing the combined use of RQD and joint
38
spacing with a sole use of joint frequency in the RMR system and stated that the limitations
39
40 associated with the use of RQD can be removed. This stance is very controversial [16], and joint
41 frequency is also orientation-dependent.
42 In this study, to overcome the aforementioned problems, a modified blockiness index (MBi)
43 [17] was introduced, and attempts were made to finely demarcate the homogeneous structural
44
regions in the study area (i.e. an underground mining stope). Subsequently, an improved RMR
45
46 system (RMRmbi), in which the combined use of RQD and joint spacing was replaced with MBi,
47 was adopted to three-dimensionally assess rock mass qualities. This study provides robust
48 guidance for underground mine support and numerical simulation of rock mass behaviour (e.g. the
49
Discrete Element Model).

3 a sole value, and this approach is often one of ‘overgeneralisation’. To address this problem, an
4 idea of regionally classifying rock mass qualities, i.e. identifying rock mass homogeneous
5
structural regions then classifying rock mass qualities, is proposed. Based on this idea, the
6
7 associated procedure was established and can be outlined as follows: (i) using an existing
8 identification method of homogeneous structural regions and considering the implication of
9 large-scale joints, the given rock mass was finely regionalised using the MBi index and (ii) a
10 visualisation of overall rock mass qualities differentiated by RMRmbi values was performed. The
11
flowchart for regionally classifying rock mass qualities is shown in Figure 1, and details can be
12
13 found in Sections 3 to 6.

20
21
22 The Zinc-polymetallic Mine is in Tongkeng, Guangxi Province, in Southwest China, and is
23 rich in tin, lead, zinc, antimony, and indium. It is also a large production base of nonferrous metals
24 in China. Faults are well developed in the Zinc-polymetallic Mine, and the ore bodies mainly
25
26 occur in marlstone, calcareous marl, shale, and so on. An underground mining stope (with a size of
27 approximately 60 m × 100 m × 50 m) was selected as the testing area (Figure 2(a)), and the field
28 observation has been carried out (Figure 2(b)).
29
30
31 3.2. Determination of the distribution parameters of probabilistic
32
33
joints
34
35
36 The existing identification method of homogeneous structural regions mostly focuses on
37 examining the homogeneous degree of joints between two sites, and the tested joints are always
38
39 small scale (i.e. mechanical joints with a trace length of approximately 4 m or shorter) and
40 intersect inside the rock mass in a significant amount. The geometrical parameters of small-scale
41 joints can always be said to have a probabilistic distribution, and hence, when a joint network
42 model is created, a large number of small-scale joints are randomly generated via a distribution
43
function, which corresponds to the in-situ conditions examined, and are termed ‘probabilistic
44
45 joints’ [18]. The small-scale joints in the four crosscut galleries were measured, and the orientation
46 data are shown in Figure 3.
47 Sufficient samples were obtained in the criss-crossed galleries, which enabled a test to
48 determine the homogeneous degree of all the observed small-scale joints. The method proposed by
49
50 Li et al. [7] was employed to test such a degree (detailed processes are not repeatedly presented).
51 It can be concluded that all the statistical p values calculated are greater than 0.05, and hence no
52 significant difference exists between these samples, which indicates that the small-scale joints in
53 the test area are statistically homogeneous.
54
Overall small-scale joint data are presented in Figure 4, and the probabilistic distribution
55
56 parameters of these joints were determined as shown in Table 1, which can be used to generate

7
8 properties
9
10
11 Some joints have been observed that are greater than the gallery scale. Investigation shows
12 that these joints mostly belong to incipient discontinuities, minor faults, bedding planes, etc.
13
Because the quantity is relatively small, these large-scale joints can be defined as ‘deterministic
14
15 joints’ [19].
16 It is possible to define the diameter of a large-scale joint as infinite (note that the disc-joint
17 model is used for creating a joint network). However, if all the observed joints that are greater than
18
the gallery scale are generated as an infinite plane, the computer calculation is very
19
20 time-consuming, and the intensity of jointing will be overestimated because the majority of
21 large-scale joints may be connected. Therefore, a determination method for connected joints was
22 employed, which enables the identification of the connected large-scale joints in an underground
23 mining stope. In this method, the connectivity degree of large-scale joints can be examined with
24
respect to joint categorisation, mechanical property, coplanar condition, etc. (more details are
25
26 provided in the supplementary materials).
27 Following the determination method of connected joints, the connectivity degrees of
28 large-scale joints were investigated (detailed processes were not repeatedly presented), and a total
29
of 42 deterministic joints were identified. Most of them are incipient discontinuities, minor faults,
30
31 and bedding planes, with lithologies of limestone and silicite. The fillings are mainly calcite, and
32 the joint wall is smooth or rough. The groundwater conditions are completely dry. The
33 deterministic joints can be generated using five input parameters: x, y, z, a, and ß. (x, y, z) denotes
34 the coordinate of the disc-model centre, a is the dip direction, and ß is the dip. The deterministic
35
joint network is shown in Figure 5.

39
3.4. Three-dimensional joint network model coupling probabilistic
40
41 and deterministic joints
42
43
44 Typically, when the small-scale joints show a statistically homogeneous feature, the tested
45 samples (galleries) can be treated as identical homogeneous structural regions. However, the
46 large-scale joints should not be ignored, and thus, a further identification of homogeneous
47 structural regions should be conducted. Before proceeding with this further identification, a
48
49 three-dimensional joint network model coupling probabilistic and deterministic joints (with a size
50 of 60 m × 100 m × 50 m) was developed (Figure 6). Note that the generated range of probabilistic
51 joints was 80 m × 120 m × 70 m, because there are some joints whose disc-model centres are
52 outside the model but intersect the model, i.e. boundary effects were eliminated.

10 4.1. Selection of the identification index and rationality
11
12 Generally, various geometrical parameters, including joint orientation, trace length, and joint
13
density, can be used to identify structural region boundaries. In this study, the given rock masses
14
15 were finely regionalised in three dimensions using the MBi index. The MBi index is defined as the
16 ratio of the volume of rock blocks, which are fully enclosed by joints, to the total rock mass
17 volume, and it can be calculated as follows:
18
1 1 1 1
19 MBi = B1 + B2 + B3 + B4 + B5 (1)
20 2 3 4 5
21 where B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 are the block percentages of the volumes in five intervals (0–0.008 m3,
22 0.008–0.03 m3, 0.03–0.2 m3, 0.2–1.0 m3 and > 1.0 m3), respectively. A higher MBi value indicates
23 a more fractured rock mass, and vice versa.
24
Over the years, joint orientation has typically been used to evaluate homogeneous structural
25
26 regions, though it is not a prerequisite [20]. For example, Kulatilake et al. [21] used the box fractal
27 dimension as a measure of a statistically homogeneous rock mass; they also reported that block
28 sizes are primarily controlled by joint persistence and density.
29
The MBi index is a three-dimensional measurement of block size and degree of jointing that
30
31 can capture the effects of joint persistence and density [22, 23]. Meanwhile, the MBi value is
32 produced by the joint network, which can be exactly adopted for structural region identification
33 based on the three-dimensional joint network model coupling the probabilistic and deterministic
34 joints.

37 4.2. Discretising the three-dimensional joint network model into
38
39
40 subdomains
41
42
Before discretising the three-dimensional joint network model (Figure 6) into subdomains,
43
44 the size of the subdomain needs to be determined. Referring to the concept of Representative
45 Elementary Volume (REV) [23], the optimal size of the subdomain was derived via the following
46 steps: (i) the children models of the gradually increasing sizes were generated inside the parent
47 model, as shown in Figure 7; (ii) the MBi values of all the children models were calculated using
48
49 Eq. (1); and (iii) the optimal size of 20 m was determined using the coefficient of variation (Cv), as
50 shown in Figure 8. It is noted that the deterministic joints are temporarily excluded in the parent
51 model, because if the deterministic joints are considered, the whole joint network model is no
52 longer statistically homogeneous and the determined REV size is meaningless.
53
The interlocking subdomains that are partially overlapped each other were generated within
54
55 the three-dimensional joint network model, and the distance between the two adjacent subdomains
56 is 1 m (Figure 9). Additionally, to measure the MBi values of the model boundaries, all the
57 5
58

1
2
3 deterministic and probabilistic joints were generated and accommodated in a space of 80 m × 120
4 m × 70 m, and the true model size was 60 m × 100 m × 50 m. The MBi values of all subdomains
5
were determined, as shown in Figure 10, which have a normal distribution with parameter µ of
6
7 0.2703 and s2 of 0.2721.

10 4.3. Finely identifying homogeneous structural regions using k-means
11
12 and sum of squared errors
13
14
15 Cluster analysis is a process that partitions objects into a groups, and the yielded groups are
16 generally called clusters. Objects in the same cluster are more similar, in some sense, to each other
17 than to those in the other clusters. Cluster analysis is essentially similar to homogeneous structural
18
region identification. To measure the similarity degree between different subdomains, a k-means
19
20 algorithm [24] was used to cluster the MBi values of all the subdomains.
21 The k-means algorithm is a widely used clustering procedure. Before the k-means algorithm
22 is executed, the cluster number should be determined. A classical k-means algorithm can be
23 performed via the following steps: (i) randomly distribute the sample {x1, x2, ..., xn} to k clusters,
24
and calculate the initial centre of each cluster {z1, z2, ..., zk} using Eq. (2) as follows:
25
26 1
27
Zi = <U+2211> xi
n xi <U+2208>si
(2)
28 where n is number of objects in cluster i and si denotes cluster i; (ii) compute the distances
29
between the object xi and Zi (i = 1, 2, …, k), and allocate this object to its nearest cluster; (iii)
30
31 update the centre of the k cluster using Eq. (2); and (iv) calculate the D value using Eq. (3) as
32 follows:
33 n
D = <U+2211> <U+F8EE> min r =1, 2, ..., k d ( xi ,zi ) <U+F8F9>
2
34 <U+F8F0> <U+F8FB> (3)
i =1
35
and (v) end the algorithm if the D values converge, and if not, return to step (ii).
36
37 In this section, sum of squared error (SSE) was adopted to determine an optimal cluster
38 number, which can be calculated as follows:
39 2
40
k
SSE = <U+2211> <U+2211> d ( xi ,zi ) (4)
41 i =1 x<U+2208>si
42
43 When the cluster number increases, the number of objects in a cluster will decrease, and the
44 distances between the objects and the corresponding centres of the clusters will shorten. In this
45 circumstance, SSE values will decrease. However, when the decrease degree of SSE values lessens,
46
i.e. the slopes of the curve (SSE vs. cluster number) insignificantly vary, a conclusion can be
47
48 reached that increasing the cluster number can no longer improve the clustering qualities, and the
49 corresponding data point can be deemed the turning point in the curve. Thus, the associated cluster
50 number can be regarded as optimal. A scatter plot of SSE and cluster number was developed as
51
shown in Figure 11, indicating that the optimal cluster number is six. Therefore, a k-means
52
53 algorithm with a cluster number of six was executed, and six clusters were yielded as follows:
54 [0.02747%,0.14986%], [0.14987%,0.28447%], [0.28448%,0.47531%], [0.47532%,0.68421%],
55 [0.68422%,0.96486%] and [0.96487%,1.91390%]. These concurrently suggest that the data

2
3 values in the same cluster are highly similar, and the associated subdomains can be grouped into a
4 homogeneous structural region.
5
6
7 4.4. Synthetic model of homogeneous structural regions and its
8
9
10 verification
11
12 Pre-processing of subdomains was performed: all the subdomains were contracted into
13
elements (or say, sub subdomains) of 1 m × 1 m × 1 m along the centres of the subdomains, as
14
15 shown in Figure 12. In turn, the model (Figure 6) was discretised again into elements.
16 Subsequently, these elements were stained different colours according to their associated MBi
17 values, i.e. MBi values in the same cluster were highlighted with an identical colour, as shown in
18
Figure 13. The histogram of the rock mass volumes in different homogeneous structural regions is
19
20 shown in Figure 14.
21 As can be seen in Figures 13 and 14, the vast majority of rock masses in the study area fall
22 into the intervals [0.002747%, 0.14986%] and [0.014987, 0.28447%]. If the joint network model
23 of the study area is entirely built by probabilistic joints, the MBi values of the children models
24
range from 0.033% to 0.045% (as shown in Figure 8), which falls into the interval [0.014987,
25
26 0.28447%]. Thus, it can be concluded that the MBi values of the whole study area are majorly
27 affected by probabilistic joints. However, it is improper to evaluate the overall study area as a
28 homogeneous structural region, because the MBi values of the children models in the probabilistic
29
joint network vary within a narrow interval. Figure 14 shows that a substantial proportion of
30
31 subdomains have higher MBi values than the children models of the REV sizes, and this is a result
32 of a large number of deterministic joints that enhance the degree of jointing. Nevertheless, the
33 existing identification method of structural regions is limited in this respect.
34 Cross-sections were extracted along the three-dimensional joint network model (Figure 6)
35
and synthetic model of the homogeneous structural regions (Figure 13) at half length, half width,
36
37 and half height, and comparisons were conducted to validate the accuracy of the fine
38 identifications of homogeneous structural regions (Figure 15). Visual inspections were performed,
39 based on the dense degree of joints; as shown in the closed red (dotted) wireframes in Figure 15,
40
where the dense degree of joints is high, the MBi value is high. In short, this synthetic model of
41
42 homogeneous structural regions can capture the differences in joint densities between subdomains,
43 and its accuracy is supported.

46 5 A rock mass quality classification system: RMRmbi
47
48
49 5.1. Introduction to RMRmbi
50
51
52 The failure to accurately assess rock mass qualities may be a result of an unreliable
53 measurement of block size [13]. Some drawbacks of the simultaneous use of RQD and joint
54
spacing in the RMR system have been widely acknowledged as follows: 1) both RQD and joint
55
56 spacing are anisotropic, 2) the RQD concept ignores the block size effect [15], 3) joint persistence
57 7
58
59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 8 of 28
1
2
3 is neglected, and 4) the simultaneous use repeatedly calculates the joint density [26].
4 In this instance, the RMRmbi was introduced, in which the simultaneous use of RQD and joint
5
spacing is replaced with MBi and the other input parameters remain unchanged. The RMRmbi
6
7 shows a sort of superiority compared to the RMR [17, 23] as follows: 1) MBi is a
8 three-dimensional quantification of jointing degree and is not anisotropic, 2) MBi counts blocks of
9 all sizes, 3) joint persistence is considered, and 4) the RMRmbi does not repeatedly calculate the
10 joint density. The rating of MBi (RM) can be determined using a continuous function as follows:
11
RM = 40 - 0.4 × MBi (5)
12
13 The higher the MBi value, the higher the degree of jointing, and the poorer the rock mass quality.
14
15
16 5.2. Viability of RMRmbi
17
18
19 5.2.1. Preliminarily analysing the viability of RMRmbi based on theoretical
20
21 Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) models
22
23
As described in this section, a significant amount of theoretical DFN models were created to
24
25 preliminarily analyse the viability of RMRmbi. Because the degree of jointing (or block size) is
26 primarily influenced by joint spacing and persistence [23, 25], 20 joint spacing values and 10 joint
27 persistence values were chosen (Table 2) and then cross-joined, and in this manner, 200
28 combinations of joint spacing and persistence were obtained. Additionally, the other input
29
30 parameters of DFN models were fixed, as shown in Table 3. Based on the 200 combinations and
31 the fixed parameters, 200 theoretical DFN models were established (Figure 16).
32 Because the RMRmbi and RMR only differ in the characterisation of the degree of jointing, the
33 RQD values and the joint spacing values of all theoretical DFN models were determined referring
34
to [27], as shown in Figures 17 and 18. Additionally, all the measured MBi values are shown in
35
36 Figure 19. Based on Figures 17 to 19, the ratings of RQD plus joint spacing (RRQD+JS) and MBi (RM)
37 were calculated, according to [28] and Eq. (5), respectively, as shown in Figure 20. This figure
38 shows that for the majority of theoretical DFN models, the RRQD+JS and RM share similar
39 evaluation results, e.g. in the intervals of 10 to 30. However, for a number of theoretical DFN
40
41 models, the two rating standards yield different results, which may be because of the implication
42 of joint persistence on MBi. The correlation coefficient r [29] between RM and RRQD+JS was
43 determined to be 0.93, which is very close to 1, and this suggests that 1) RM and RRQD+JS share a
44 similar sensibility to distinguish rock mass structures and 2) the evaluation results of RM are in
45
close proximity to those of RRQD+JS, which has been substantially applied, and therefore, RM is
46
47 potentially adoptable.
48
49
5.2.2. Assessing the viability of RMRmbi based on several real data
50
51
52 As described in this section, some real data (including all the input parameters of RMRmbi and
53 RMR) collected from [30-33] were used to again support the viability of RMRmbi, and the final
54
rating results are shown in Figure 21. It can be seen that the fitting line is near the 1:1 line,
55
56 suggesting that they have similar abilities to evaluate the qualities of real rock masses. However,
57 8
58
59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 9 of 28 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 the fitting line is under the 1:1 line, which indicates that most RMRmbi values are greater than those
4 of RMR, and in turn, when appraising the rock mass qualities in the “Fair” category or higher, the
5
RMRmbi may not be as conservative similar to RMR.
6
7 Overall, according to the results of the simulated experiments and real applications, it is
8 considered that RMRmbi is a workable classification method with great application potential.
9 RMRmbi not only overcomes the theoretical limitations of RQD and joint spacing but also produces
10 practical and reasonable rating results. Figures 20 and 21 imply that RMRmbi is slightly different
11
from RMR, and this circumstance is inevitable because the subsystem of RMRmbi (RM) can capture
12
13 the influence of joint persistence on the degree of jointing.
14
15
16 6. Visualisation of the regional rock mass quality
17
18 classification results
19
20
21 As described in Section 4, the MBi values of all elements of the three-dimensional joint
22 network model were obtained. Therefore, based on the synthetic model of homogeneous structural
23 regions (Figure 13), the RMRmbi classification and its visualisation can be effectively implemented.
24
During the geological investigation, a large number of stations were sighted in the main and
25
26 crosscut galleries, and the geological data were measured. The Kriging method 11 was used to
27 estimate the RMRmbi values of the untouchable rock masses, based on geological data measured in
28 galleries. Then, the visual model of RMRmbi classification was constructed, which was stained with
29
different colours according to the RMRmbi values (Figure 22).
30
31 As shown in Figure 22, the rock masses of the study area are in Classes <U+0399>, <U+0399>I, and III,
32 respectively. The volumes of the rock masses of the different classes were counted, as shown in
33 Figure 23. The great majority of rock masses are in Class II followed by Classes III and <U+0399> as
34 follows: 25.9857 × 104 m3 (Class II), 3.4568 × 104 m3 (Class III), and 0.5575 × 104 m3 (Class <U+0399>).
35
The rock masses in the three classes differ greatly in volume, indicating that Class II is the
36
37 dominant quality of the study area. Additionally, the rock mass qualities gradually decrease with
38 an increase in depth.
39
40
41 7. Conclusions
42
43
44 To address the problem that rock mass quality classification is often one of
45 ‘overgeneralisation’ when a traditional evaluation approach is used, the idea of regionally
46 classifying rock mass qualities, i.e. identifying rock mass homogeneous structural regions then
47 classifying rock mass qualities, was proposed and the associated procedure presented.
48
49 Visualisations of homogeneous structural region identification were performed and rock mass
50 classification results obtained. This work allows for several conclusions as follows:
51 (i) An existing evaluation method of structural regions were employed to determine the
52 distribution parameters of probabilistic joints, and the deterministic joints were identified through
53
a determination method of connected joints. Subsequently, a three-dimensional joint network
54
55 model coupling probabilistic and deterministic joints was established.
56 (ii) The blockiness level of rock masses are primarily controlled by joint spacing and
57 9
58
59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 10 of 28
1
2
3 persistence; thus, these two joint properties can be considered in three dimensions if the MBi index
4 is used to finely identify homogeneous structural regions.
5
(iii) The k-means and SSE were used together to cluster the measured MBi values of all
6
7 subdomains, and optimal cluster numbers and clustering results were obtained. The MBi values in
8 the same cluster can be said to have originated from an identical source (i.e. homogeneous
9 structural region).
10 (iv) The three-dimensionally fine identification of homogeneous structural regions performed
11
in this study can consider the implications of joint persistence and spacing, which have a strong
12
13 identification ability. The identification results (synthetic model of homogeneous structural
14 regions) can reflect the discontinuous and inhomogeneous features of natural rock masses.
15 (v) The consolidate use of RQD and joint spacing in the conventional RMR system was
16
replaced with the MBi index, and this version was termed RMRmbi. Based on a large volume of
17
18 theoretical DFN models and several real data, it is proved that RM and RRQD+JF share a similar
19 sensibility to differentiate rock mass structures, and RMRmbi have a similar applicability compared
20 to the RMR system. In other words, for the majority of rock masses, RMRmbi and RMR yield
21 semblable results, indicating that RMRmbi is adoptable; but owing to the difference in rock mass
22
structure characterisation, it is apparent that a slight discrepancy exists between the two systems.
23
24 However, undoubtedly, the theoretical limitations caused by the combined use of RQD and joint
25 spacing was tackled in the RMRmbi system that, as a consequence, have a strong application
26 potential.
27
(vi) Based on the identification results of homogeneous structural regions, the RMRmbi system
28
29 was applied to the study area, and a visual model of classification results of rock mass qualities
30 was established. In this way, the complicated data (i.e. rock mass quality classification results)
31 were converted to a three-dimensional digital model, which are beneficial in representing the
32 spatial distribution of rock mass qualities and determining the engineering support schemes.

21 Abstract: In rock engineering projects, professionals assess the overall rock mass qualities using a
22
sole value. However, the true qualities of partial rock masses are incompatible with such a value.
23
24 To address this problem, the idea of regionally classifying rock mass qualities is proposed and the
25 associated procedure presented. To achieve this goal, the probabilistic and deterministic joints
26 within the study area were determined, and a three-dimensional joint network model was created.
27 Then, the three-dimensional joint network model was discretised into interlocking subdomains,
28
29 and the modified blockiness index (MBi) was used to finely identify the homogeneous structural
30 regions, together with the k-means algorithm and the sum of squared errors (SSE). A synthetic
31 model comprising homogeneous structural regions was developed and validated with respect to
32 the extracted cross-sections. Next, an improved Rock Mass Rating system (RMRmbi) was
33
introduced, and the viability of RMRmbi was supported through a significant amount of theoretical
34
35 cases and several real cases. Finally, visualisation of regional RMRmbi classification results was
36 performed. Results show that: (i) the homogeneous structural regions are finely demarcated in
37 three dimensions; and (ii) the proposed idea can overcome the problem of rock mass quality

43 1. Introduction
44
45 Rock mass quality classification is an auxiliary tool frequently used as an indicator for rock
46
engineering, in which various rock materials and/or rock mass properties are quantified and
47
48 subsequently combined using addition and subtraction [1], multiplication and division [2], etc.,
49 and therefore, the overall quality of a given rock mass can be numerically assessed. A major
50 benefit of such a classification system is that it can provide empirical guidance for designing rock
51 engineering structures (e.g. excavation spans) [3] and also enable the estimation of rock mass
52
53 mechanical properties, e.g. rock mass strength and rock mass deformation modulus [4].
54 Typically, rock mass quality classification results cannot be elaborated to a meter range [5],
55 e.g. a Rock Mass Rating (RMR) value always summarises the average quality of the rock masses

3 in a segment of surrounding tunnel. For rock engineering projects (e.g. a rock dam or underground
4 opening), engineers often assess the overall rock mass quality using a sole value, which, as in this
5
case, may be problematic as the true qualities of the partial rock masses are incompatible with
6
7 such a value. Some investigations have been undertaken to address this problem, e.g. Shang et al.
8 [6] regionalised rock masses through engineering geological rock groupings in conjunction with
9 lithologies and then conducted rock mass quality ratings in different regions. However,
10 lithological regionalisation does not consider rock mass structure, and even if the lithologies are
11
identical or similar, rock mass qualities vary with different degrees of rock mass jointing.
12
13 Objectively, a guideline should be followed when rock mass quality classification is conducted, i.e.
14 regionalising rock masses and then classifying rock mass qualities. Because lithological
15 regionalisation is slightly insufficient, the authors believe that the homogeneous structural region
16
[7] (a further geological zoning) may be more appropriate, i.e. identifying rock mass
17
18 homogeneous structural regions then classifying rock mass qualities.
19 Many existing identification methods of homogeneous structural regions zone engineer rock
20 mass from a two-dimensional perspective, i.e. a rock outcrop, and utilise the joint data measured
21 in daylighting rock masses, including joint orientation and joint density, to divide a given rock
22
mass into different domains together with statistical knowledge. These existing methods mostly
23
24 focus on small-scale joints (a trace length of approximately 4 m or shorter) [8, 9], which are
25 widely used in hydraulics, particularly the creation of a Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) model
26 and the subsequent seepage analysis. However, in these existing methods, some large-scale joints
27
(e.g. incipient discontinuities, minor faults, and bedding planes) are always ignored or defined as
28
29 the presumptive boundaries of a homogeneous structural region [10, 11]. Therefore, the existing
30 methods cannot consider the implications of large-scale joints.
31 Additionally, some traditional rock mass quality classification systems, such as RMR 1, are
32 limited in terms of quantification of the degree of jointing, i.e. the incorporation of Rock Quality
33
Designation (RQD) [12], which is frequently used in the rock engineering field but has some
34
35 drawbacks as follows [13, 14]: (i) RQD only counts the core pieces longer than 100 mm and fails
36 to consider the effect of block size [15]; and (ii) the RQD value is sensitive to orientation (i.e.
37 orientation bias). Lowson et al. [4] recommended replacing the combined use of RQD and joint
38
spacing with a sole use of joint frequency in the RMR system and stated that the limitations
39
40 associated with the use of RQD can be removed. This stance is very controversial [16], and joint
41 frequency is also orientation-dependent.
42 In this study, to overcome the aforementioned problems, a modified blockiness index (MBi)
43 [17] was introduced, and attempts were made to finely demarcate the homogeneous structural
44
regions in the study area (i.e. an underground mining stope). Subsequently, an improved RMR
45
46 system (RMRmbi), in which the combined use of RQD and joint spacing was replaced with MBi,
47 was adopted to three-dimensionally assess rock mass qualities. This study provides robust
48 guidance for underground mine support and numerical simulation of rock mass behaviour (e.g. the
49
Discrete Element Model).

3 a sole value, and this approach is often one of ‘overgeneralisation’. To address this problem, an
4 idea of regionally classifying rock mass qualities, i.e. identifying rock mass homogeneous
5
structural regions then classifying rock mass qualities, is proposed. Based on this idea, the
6
7 associated procedure was established and can be outlined as follows: (i) using an existing
8 identification method of homogeneous structural regions and considering the implication of
9 large-scale joints, the given rock mass was finely regionalised using the MBi index and (ii) a
10 visualisation of overall rock mass qualities differentiated by RMRmbi values was performed. The
11
flowchart for regionally classifying rock mass qualities is shown in Figure 1, and details can be
12
13 found in Sections 3 to 6.

20
21
22 The Zinc-polymetallic Mine is in Tongkeng, Guangxi Province, in Southwest China, and is
23 rich in tin, lead, zinc, antimony, and indium. It is also a large production base of nonferrous metals
24 in China. Faults are well developed in the Zinc-polymetallic Mine, and the ore bodies mainly
25
26 occur in marlstone, calcareous marl, shale, and so on. An underground mining stope (with a size of
27 approximately 60 m × 100 m × 50 m) was selected as the testing area (Figure 2(a)), and the field
28 observation has been carried out (Figure 2(b)).
29
30
31 3.2. Determination of the distribution parameters of probabilistic
32
33
joints
34
35
36 The existing identification method of homogeneous structural regions mostly focuses on
37 examining the homogeneous degree of joints between two sites, and the tested joints are always
38
39 small scale (i.e. mechanical joints with a trace length of approximately 4 m or shorter) and
40 intersect inside the rock mass in a significant amount. The geometrical parameters of small-scale
41 joints can always be said to have a probabilistic distribution, and hence, when a joint network
42 model is created, a large number of small-scale joints are randomly generated via a distribution
43
function, which corresponds to the in-situ conditions examined, and are termed ‘probabilistic
44
45 joints’ [18]. The small-scale joints in the four crosscut galleries were measured, and the orientation
46 data are shown in Figure 3.
47 Sufficient samples were obtained in the criss-crossed galleries, which enabled a test to
48 determine the homogeneous degree of all the observed small-scale joints. The method proposed by
49
50 Li et al. [7] was employed to test such a degree (detailed processes are not repeatedly presented).
51 It can be concluded that all the statistical p values calculated are greater than 0.05, and hence no
52 significant difference exists between these samples, which indicates that the small-scale joints in
53 the test area are statistically homogeneous.
54
Overall small-scale joint data are presented in Figure 4, and the probabilistic distribution
55
56 parameters of these joints were determined as shown in Table 1, which can be used to generate

7
8 properties
9
10
11 Some joints have been observed that are greater than the gallery scale. Investigation shows
12 that these joints mostly belong to incipient discontinuities, minor faults, bedding planes, etc.
13
Because the quantity is relatively small, these large-scale joints can be defined as ‘deterministic
14
15 joints’ [19].
16 It is possible to define the diameter of a large-scale joint as infinite (note that the disc-joint
17 model is used for creating a joint network). However, if all the observed joints that are greater than
18
the gallery scale are generated as an infinite plane, the computer calculation is very
19
20 time-consuming, and the intensity of jointing will be overestimated because the majority of
21 large-scale joints may be connected. Therefore, a determination method for connected joints was
22 employed, which enables the identification of the connected large-scale joints in an underground
23 mining stope. In this method, the connectivity degree of large-scale joints can be examined with
24
respect to joint categorisation, mechanical property, coplanar condition, etc. (more details are
25
26 provided in the supplementary materials).
27 Following the determination method of connected joints, the connectivity degrees of
28 large-scale joints were investigated (detailed processes were not repeatedly presented), and a total
29
of 42 deterministic joints were identified. Most of them are incipient discontinuities, minor faults,
30
31 and bedding planes, with lithologies of limestone and silicite. The fillings are mainly calcite, and
32 the joint wall is smooth or rough. The groundwater conditions are completely dry. The
33 deterministic joints can be generated using five input parameters: x, y, z, a, and ß. (x, y, z) denotes
34 the coordinate of the disc-model centre, a is the dip direction, and ß is the dip. The deterministic
35
joint network is shown in Figure 5.

3.4. Three-dimensional joint network model coupling probabilistic
40
41 and deterministic joints
42
43
44 Typically, when the small-scale joints show a statistically homogeneous feature, the tested
45 samples (galleries) can be treated as identical homogeneous structural regions. However, the
46 large-scale joints should not be ignored, and thus, a further identification of homogeneous
47 structural regions should be conducted. Before proceeding with this further identification, a
48
49 three-dimensional joint network model coupling probabilistic and deterministic joints (with a size
50 of 60 m × 100 m × 50 m) was developed (Figure 6). Note that the generated range of probabilistic
51 joints was 80 m × 120 m × 70 m, because there are some joints whose disc-model centres are
52 outside the model but intersect the model, i.e. boundary effects were eliminated.

10 4.1. Selection of the identification index and rationality
11
12 Generally, various geometrical parameters, including joint orientation, trace length, and joint
13
density, can be used to identify structural region boundaries. In this study, the given rock masses
14
15 were finely regionalised in three dimensions using the MBi index. The MBi index is defined as the
16 ratio of the volume of rock blocks, which are fully enclosed by joints, to the total rock mass
17 volume, and it can be calculated as follows:
18
1 1 1 1
19 MBi = B1 + B2 + B3 + B4 + B5 (1)
20 2 3 4 5
21 where B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 are the block percentages of the volumes in five intervals (0–0.008 m3,
22 0.008–0.03 m3, 0.03–0.2 m3, 0.2–1.0 m3 and > 1.0 m3), respectively. A higher MBi value indicates
23 a more fractured rock mass, and vice versa.
24
Over the years, joint orientation has typically been used to evaluate homogeneous structural
25
26 regions, though it is not a prerequisite [20]. For example, Kulatilake et al. [21] used the box fractal
27 dimension as a measure of a statistically homogeneous rock mass; they also reported that block
28 sizes are primarily controlled by joint persistence and density.
29
The MBi index is a three-dimensional measurement of block size and degree of jointing that
30
31 can capture the effects of joint persistence and density [22, 23]. Meanwhile, the MBi value is
32 produced by the joint network, which can be exactly adopted for structural region identification
33 based on the three-dimensional joint network model coupling the probabilistic and deterministic
34 joints.
35
36
37 4.2. Discretising the three-dimensional joint network model into
38
39
40 subdomains
41
42
Before discretising the three-dimensional joint network model (Figure 6) into subdomains,
43
44 the size of the subdomain needs to be determined. Referring to the concept of Representative
45 Elementary Volume (REV) [23], the optimal size of the subdomain was derived via the following
46 steps: (i) the children models of the gradually increasing sizes were generated inside the parent
47 model, as shown in Figure 7; (ii) the MBi values of all the children models were calculated using
48
49 Eq. (1); and (iii) the optimal size of 20 m was determined using the coefficient of variation (Cv), as
50 shown in Figure 8. It is noted that the deterministic joints are temporarily excluded in the parent
51 model, because if the deterministic joints are considered, the whole joint network model is no
52 longer statistically homogeneous and the determined REV size is meaningless.
53
The interlocking subdomains that are partially overlapped each other were generated within
54
55 the three-dimensional joint network model, and the distance between the two adjacent subdomains
56 is 1 m (Figure 9). Additionally, to measure the MBi values of the model boundaries, all the
57 5
58
59

2
3 deterministic and probabilistic joints were generated and accommodated in a space of 80 m × 120
4 m × 70 m, and the true model size was 60 m × 100 m × 50 m. The MBi values of all subdomains
5
were determined, as shown in Figure 10, which have a normal distribution with parameter µ of
6
7 0.2703 and s2 of 0.2721.

10 4.3. Finely identifying homogeneous structural regions using k-means
11
12 and sum of squared errors
13
14
15 Cluster analysis is a process that partitions objects into a groups, and the yielded groups are
16 generally called clusters. Objects in the same cluster are more similar, in some sense, to each other
17 than to those in the other clusters. Cluster analysis is essentially similar to homogeneous structural
18
region identification. To measure the similarity degree between different subdomains, a k-means
19
20 algorithm [24] was used to cluster the MBi values of all the subdomains.
21 The k-means algorithm is a widely used clustering procedure. Before the k-means algorithm
22 is executed, the cluster number should be determined. A classical k-means algorithm can be
23 performed via the following steps: (i) randomly distribute the sample {x1, x2, ..., xn} to k clusters,
24
and calculate the initial centre of each cluster {z1, z2, ..., zk} using Eq. (2) as follows:
25
26 1
27
Zi = <U+2211> xi
n xi <U+2208>si
(2)
28 where n is number of objects in cluster i and si denotes cluster i; (ii) compute the distances
29
between the object xi and Zi (i = 1, 2, …, k), and allocate this object to its nearest cluster; (iii)
30
31 update the centre of the k cluster using Eq. (2); and (iv) calculate the D value using Eq. (3) as
32 follows:
33 n
D = <U+2211> <U+F8EE> min r =1, 2, ..., k d ( xi ,zi ) <U+F8F9>
2
34 <U+F8F0> <U+F8FB> (3)
i =1
35
and (v) end the algorithm if the D values converge, and if not, return to step (ii).
36
37 In this section, sum of squared error (SSE) was adopted to determine an optimal cluster
38 number, which can be calculated as follows:
39 2
40
k
SSE = <U+2211> <U+2211> d ( xi ,zi ) (4)
41 i =1 x<U+2208>si
42
43 When the cluster number increases, the number of objects in a cluster will decrease, and the
44 distances between the objects and the corresponding centres of the clusters will shorten. In this
45 circumstance, SSE values will decrease. However, when the decrease degree of SSE values lessens,
46
i.e. the slopes of the curve (SSE vs. cluster number) insignificantly vary, a conclusion can be
47
48 reached that increasing the cluster number can no longer improve the clustering qualities, and the
49 corresponding data point can be deemed the turning point in the curve. Thus, the associated cluster
50 number can be regarded as optimal. A scatter plot of SSE and cluster number was developed as
51
shown in Figure 11, indicating that the optimal cluster number is six. Therefore, a k-means
52
53 algorithm with a cluster number of six was executed, and six clusters were yielded as follows:
54 [0.02747%,0.14986%], [0.14987%,0.28447%], [0.28448%,0.47531%], [0.47532%,0.68421%],
55 [0.68422%,0.96486%] and [0.96487%,1.91390%]. These concurrently suggest that the data

2
3 values in the same cluster are highly similar, and the associated subdomains can be grouped into a
4 homogeneous structural region.
5
6
7 4.4. Synthetic model of homogeneous structural regions and its
8
9
10 verification
11
12 Pre-processing of subdomains was performed: all the subdomains were contracted into
13
elements (or say, sub subdomains) of 1 m × 1 m × 1 m along the centres of the subdomains, as
14
15 shown in Figure 12. In turn, the model (Figure 6) was discretised again into elements.
16 Subsequently, these elements were stained different colours according to their associated MBi
17 values, i.e. MBi values in the same cluster were highlighted with an identical colour, as shown in
18
Figure 13. The histogram of the rock mass volumes in different homogeneous structural regions is
19
20 shown in Figure 14.
21 As can be seen in Figures 13 and 14, the vast majority of rock masses in the study area fall
22 into the intervals [0.002747%, 0.14986%] and [0.014987, 0.28447%]. If the joint network model
23 of the study area is entirely built by probabilistic joints, the MBi values of the children models
24
range from 0.033% to 0.045% (as shown in Figure 8), which falls into the interval [0.014987,
25
26 0.28447%]. Thus, it can be concluded that the MBi values of the whole study area are majorly
27 affected by probabilistic joints. However, it is improper to evaluate the overall study area as a
28 homogeneous structural region, because the MBi values of the children models in the probabilistic
29
joint network vary within a narrow interval. Figure 14 shows that a substantial proportion of
30
31 subdomains have higher MBi values than the children models of the REV sizes, and this is a result
32 of a large number of deterministic joints that enhance the degree of jointing. Nevertheless, the
33 existing identification method of structural regions is limited in this respect.
34 Cross-sections were extracted along the three-dimensional joint network model (Figure 6)
35
and synthetic model of the homogeneous structural regions (Figure 13) at half length, half width,
36
37 and half height, and comparisons were conducted to validate the accuracy of the fine
38 identifications of homogeneous structural regions (Figure 15). Visual inspections were performed,
39 based on the dense degree of joints; as shown in the closed red (dotted) wireframes in Figure 15,
40
where the dense degree of joints is high, the MBi value is high. In short, this synthetic model of
41
42 homogeneous structural regions can capture the differences in joint densities between subdomains,
43 and its accuracy is supported.

46 5 A rock mass quality classification system: RMRmbi
47
48
49 5.1. Introduction to RMRmbi
50
51
52 The failure to accurately assess rock mass qualities may be a result of an unreliable
53 measurement of block size [13]. Some drawbacks of the simultaneous use of RQD and joint
54
spacing in the RMR system have been widely acknowledged as follows: 1) both RQD and joint
55
56 spacing are anisotropic, 2) the RQD concept ignores the block size effect [15], 3) joint persistence
57 7
58
59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 8 of 28
1
2
3 is neglected, and 4) the simultaneous use repeatedly calculates the joint density [26].
4 In this instance, the RMRmbi was introduced, in which the simultaneous use of RQD and joint
5
spacing is replaced with MBi and the other input parameters remain unchanged. The RMRmbi
6
7 shows a sort of superiority compared to the RMR [17, 23] as follows: 1) MBi is a
8 three-dimensional quantification of jointing degree and is not anisotropic, 2) MBi counts blocks of
9 all sizes, 3) joint persistence is considered, and 4) the RMRmbi does not repeatedly calculate the
10 joint density. The rating of MBi (RM) can be determined using a continuous function as follows:
11
RM = 40 - 0.4 × MBi (5)
12
13 The higher the MBi value, the higher the degree of jointing, and the poorer the rock mass quality.
14
15
16 5.2. Viability of RMRmbi
17
18
19 5.2.1. Preliminarily analysing the viability of RMRmbi based on theoretical
20
21 Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) models
22
23
As described in this section, a significant amount of theoretical DFN models were created to
24
25 preliminarily analyse the viability of RMRmbi. Because the degree of jointing (or block size) is
26 primarily influenced by joint spacing and persistence [23, 25], 20 joint spacing values and 10 joint
27 persistence values were chosen (Table 2) and then cross-joined, and in this manner, 200
28 combinations of joint spacing and persistence were obtained. Additionally, the other input
29
30 parameters of DFN models were fixed, as shown in Table 3. Based on the 200 combinations and
31 the fixed parameters, 200 theoretical DFN models were established (Figure 16).
32 Because the RMRmbi and RMR only differ in the characterisation of the degree of jointing, the
33 RQD values and the joint spacing values of all theoretical DFN models were determined referring
34
to [27], as shown in Figures 17 and 18. Additionally, all the measured MBi values are shown in
35
36 Figure 19. Based on Figures 17 to 19, the ratings of RQD plus joint spacing (RRQD+JS) and MBi (RM)
37 were calculated, according to [28] and Eq. (5), respectively, as shown in Figure 20. This figure
38 shows that for the majority of theoretical DFN models, the RRQD+JS and RM share similar
39 evaluation results, e.g. in the intervals of 10 to 30. However, for a number of theoretical DFN
40
41 models, the two rating standards yield different results, which may be because of the implication
42 of joint persistence on MBi. The correlation coefficient r [29] between RM and RRQD+JS was
43 determined to be 0.93, which is very close to 1, and this suggests that 1) RM and RRQD+JS share a
44 similar sensibility to distinguish rock mass structures and 2) the evaluation results of RM are in
45
close proximity to those of RRQD+JS, which has been substantially applied, and therefore, RM is
46
47 potentially adoptable.
48
49
5.2.2. Assessing the viability of RMRmbi based on several real data
50
51
52 As described in this section, some real data (including all the input parameters of RMRmbi and
53 RMR) collected from [30-33] were used to again support the viability of RMRmbi, and the final
54
rating results are shown in Figure 21. It can be seen that the fitting line is near the 1:1 line,
55
56 suggesting that they have similar abilities to evaluate the qualities of real rock masses. However,
57 8
58
59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 9 of 28 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 the fitting line is under the 1:1 line, which indicates that most RMRmbi values are greater than those
4 of RMR, and in turn, when appraising the rock mass qualities in the “Fair” category or higher, the
5
RMRmbi may not be as conservative similar to RMR.
6
7 Overall, according to the results of the simulated experiments and real applications, it is
8 considered that RMRmbi is a workable classification method with great application potential.
9 RMRmbi not only overcomes the theoretical limitations of RQD and joint spacing but also produces
10 practical and reasonable rating results. Figures 20 and 21 imply that RMRmbi is slightly different
11
from RMR, and this circumstance is inevitable because the subsystem of RMRmbi (RM) can capture
12
13 the influence of joint persistence on the degree of jointing.
14
15
16 6. Visualisation of the regional rock mass quality
17
18 classification results
19
20
21 As described in Section 4, the MBi values of all elements of the three-dimensional joint
22 network model were obtained. Therefore, based on the synthetic model of homogeneous structural
23 regions (Figure 13), the RMRmbi classification and its visualisation can be effectively implemented.
24
During the geological investigation, a large number of stations were sighted in the main and
25
26 crosscut galleries, and the geological data were measured. The Kriging method 11 was used to
27 estimate the RMRmbi values of the untouchable rock masses, based on geological data measured in
28 galleries. Then, the visual model of RMRmbi classification was constructed, which was stained with
29
different colours according to the RMRmbi values (Figure 22).
30
31 As shown in Figure 22, the rock masses of the study area are in Classes <U+0399>, <U+0399>I, and III,
32 respectively. The volumes of the rock masses of the different classes were counted, as shown in
33 Figure 23. The great majority of rock masses are in Class II followed by Classes III and <U+0399> as
34 follows: 25.9857 × 104 m3 (Class II), 3.4568 × 104 m3 (Class III), and 0.5575 × 104 m3 (Class <U+0399>).
35
The rock masses in the three classes differ greatly in volume, indicating that Class II is the
36
37 dominant quality of the study area. Additionally, the rock mass qualities gradually decrease with
38 an increase in depth.

41 7. Conclusions
42
43
44 To address the problem that rock mass quality classification is often one of
45 ‘overgeneralisation’ when a traditional evaluation approach is used, the idea of regionally
46 classifying rock mass qualities, i.e. identifying rock mass homogeneous structural regions then
47 classifying rock mass qualities, was proposed and the associated procedure presented.
48
49 Visualisations of homogeneous structural region identification were performed and rock mass
50 classification results obtained. This work allows for several conclusions as follows:
51 (i) An existing evaluation method of structural regions were employed to determine the
52 distribution parameters of probabilistic joints, and the deterministic joints were identified through
53
a determination method of connected joints. Subsequently, a three-dimensional joint network
54
55 model coupling probabilistic and deterministic joints was established.
56 (ii) The blockiness level of rock masses are primarily controlled by joint spacing and

2
3 persistence; thus, these two joint properties can be considered in three dimensions if the MBi index
4 is used to finely identify homogeneous structural regions.
5
(iii) The k-means and SSE were used together to cluster the measured MBi values of all
6
7 subdomains, and optimal cluster numbers and clustering results were obtained. The MBi values in
8 the same cluster can be said to have originated from an identical source (i.e. homogeneous
9 structural region).
10 (iv) The three-dimensionally fine identification of homogeneous structural regions performed
11
in this study can consider the implications of joint persistence and spacing, which have a strong
12
13 identification ability. The identification results (synthetic model of homogeneous structural
14 regions) can reflect the discontinuous and inhomogeneous features of natural rock masses.
15 (v) The consolidate use of RQD and joint spacing in the conventional RMR system was
16
replaced with the MBi index, and this version was termed RMRmbi. Based on a large volume of
17
18 theoretical DFN models and several real data, it is proved that RM and RRQD+JF share a similar
19 sensibility to differentiate rock mass structures, and RMRmbi have a similar applicability compared
20 to the RMR system. In other words, for the majority of rock masses, RMRmbi and RMR yield
21 semblable results, indicating that RMRmbi is adoptable; but owing to the difference in rock mass
22
structure characterisation, it is apparent that a slight discrepancy exists between the two systems.
23
24 However, undoubtedly, the theoretical limitations caused by the combined use of RQD and joint
25 spacing was tackled in the RMRmbi system that, as a consequence, have a strong application
26 potential.
27
(vi) Based on the identification results of homogeneous structural regions, the RMRmbi system
28
29 was applied to the study area, and a visual model of classification results of rock mass qualities
30 was established. In this way, the complicated data (i.e. rock mass quality classification results)
31 were converted to a three-dimensional digital model, which are beneficial in representing the
32 spatial distribution of rock mass qualities and determining the engineering support schemes.

Appendix C
Dear Editors and Reviewers, we made some changes in response to your
suggestions. Thank you for your contributions to improving our manuscript.
Responses to the Reviewer #1:
The authors have revised the manuscript based on the suggestions of
Reviewer #1, and the responses have been presented in the PDF file named
“Responses to the Reviewer 1”.
Responses to the Reviewer #2:
1. You indicate 'a sort of superiority' of RMR-mbi on page 8 or so. I think you
need to also acknowledge the importance of RMR in its original form, in that it
has been successfully applied to thousands of projects around the world. I agree
your method is more sophisticated, and probably more robust, but it has not (yet)
been around for 40+ years.
Reply: You are right. The traditional RMR system has been successfully
applied for more than 40 years, and its applicability should be
acknowledged. We also agree with you that although the RMR-mbi we
proposed seems to be more sophisticated, it still need more verifications that
may spend several decades. Therefore, we have mentioned it in Section 7 in
the revised manuscript.
2. With the increased sophistication/complexity, consider discussing 'how long' it
takes to perform a reasonable RMR-mbi assessment. Simple rock mass
classification assessments take a few minutes, perhaps an hour in a local area...
Reply: Thanks for your constructive suggestions. This is indeed one of the
limitations in our method, so we have demonstrated it in Section 7 in the
revised manuscript.
3. In your conclusion you discuss the 'overgeneralisation' of rock mass
classifications. I think you should also mention that your method is also a
generalisation but with improvements, it is still not a true representation of the
rock mass.
Reply: Thanks for your constructive suggestions. We have mentioned it in
Section 7 following your suggestion.
