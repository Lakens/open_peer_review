Overall, the paper is very well-written. It was almost always easy to follow and understand,
although there are some areas where more detail could be provided or the writing could be made
clearer. There are no significant typos or grammatical errors that would affect a reader’s ability to
understand the paper. In general, the logical flow is well done although I do find sometimes the
authors present something and then explain it, which can be a bit confusing. The authors should
consider re-ordering some of their explanations just so that it is clearer. The paper is scientifically
valid. The research methodology is clearly expressed. The results are described qualitatively,
which is a bit of weakness to the paper since there are well-known metrics for analyzing these
results (the authors even mention them in the paper). The authors provide a few examples, but
they claim to have analyzed over 100 images so some quantitative analysis would be better. The
conclusions do match the results, although again with only a few examples provide, the
conclusions are not particularly strong.
I recommend this paper with minor revisions, but I think the authors would do themselves a
great service by strengthening their results a quantitative analysis.
The Introduction is excellent. It is well-written and establishes the authors work in the context of
literature very well. Existing works are explained well and the authors cover most of the key
works in pertaining to their research. There are two small areas for improvement: 1) the authors
could expand slightly on why image data/modelling is useful by perhaps providing a concrete
example, 2) the authors could provide some extra detail on how good are the existing approaches
in a more concrete way, i.e. how accurate are existing approaches?
Section 2 on L-systems is well-explained. Although very minor, the authors could expand slightly
on the parametric elements for the parametric D0L-system, since some readers may not be
familiar with it. Currently, the authors only state that there is a set of formal parameters. The
example helps to illustrate but it could be explained in a bit more detail.
Section 3 is well-done. Authors should expand on the parameters in their example so that it can
be more easily understood by the reader.
Section 4. I didn’t understand the paragraph from lines 43 to the next page line 15 where they are
describing equation (5) very well without re-reading several times. It might be more helpful to re-
order the explanation and describe the alphabet and such first.
Section 4.1.1. Although I agree with the authors’ points in the next section on feature matching, it
is not entirely clear why a pixel-by-pixel fitness function is inappropriate if the goal is to
reproduce input imagery. Can the authors expand on this?
Section 4.1.2 is well done. The authors do a good job of providing a motivation for feature
matching.
Section 4.1.3. I’m not sure what this means “Also, every graphical structure has an L-system
representation in the format of one final parametric string.”
3
Authors should provide more detail Farooq et al. What did they find exactly?
If [43] and [44] have an approach to this problem then why does the authors’ work need to exist?
The authors should expand on the limitations of the existing works or provide some detail more
detail on what their approach contributes to solving these problems.
The text surrounding equation (6) is unclear. Why is it better to find a line of length 100 then the
appropriate symbols to represent such a string? Four “F” symbols will produce a very different
string when the re-writing rules are applied then a single “F”.
“1, 2, and 3 are weight factors that should be defined properly for each case” How is this done on
a case-by-case basis? What factors determine the different weights? How are the other thresholds
determined as well?
In equation (10), what are fa,b and fa,c?
Section 5. With respect to the GA operators, did the authors have any specific reasons for their
choices?
“the worst individuals were removed based on roulette wheel selection scheme” sounds like a
contradiction? Were the worst individuals removed or were population members removed based
on a roulette wheel in proportion to their fitness? It sounds like the authors mean the latter.
Section 6. For equation (13), it may not be clear to the reader where (24,15) come from, especially
the 15 parameter. I see it is explained in the next sentence. The authors should consider re-
ordering this.
For equation (15) and (16), it is not clear how the authors constructed this candidate rules. How
can they be certain that only the single “F” symbol could be an “A” instead?
Section 7.
“more than hundred fundus images” This could be 101 to many thousands. It might be better to
be more specific.
With respect to the results, do the L-systems presented re-create the entire image or just the
highlighted areas in the figures? If they do not re-create the entire image, can the authors expand
on how it can re-create the imagery? Would it be re-run for each branch?
“It should be noted that in spite of the accuracy of the correlated functions at each growth cycle,
they cannot be used for couple of consecutive growth cycle due to the error propagation and
amplification. In other words, the obtained correlated functions should be used merely for the
prediction purposes.” I’m not quite sure what this means. Can the authors clarify?
Conclusion.
In the conclusions, it seems that the authors’ main focus is on prediction of blood vessels. This
did not really come through in the Introduction. It seemed that the authors intended to reproduce
imagery. That being said, the conclusion that the authors can predict blood vessels matches very
well with their results.
Typos/Grammar/Misc:
“delivery conditions in the circulatory system[9].” Missing space before [9].
“the Axiom is going through” Axiom should be lowercase.
4
“Also, segmentation of overlaid branches with different origins will be possible more reliably.”
Reliably should be reliable I think?
“functions used in L-system Inverse problem modeling” Inverse should be lowercase.
“functions used in L-system Inverse problem” Inverse should be lowercase.
“L-system Grammar matching” Grammar should be lowercase.
“applying rewriting rules on axiom as the” Maybe on an axiom or the axiom?
, = 3.17

, = 1.62 Font sizes are different.
Notes:
“Also, a reliable vascular structure model is necessary to investigate hemodynamic parameters
and drug delivery conditions in the circulatory system[9]. Image data is a useful tool to extract
blood vessels morphological properties such as length, width, tortuosity, and branching pattern.
Retinal fundus image is one of the most important data for diagnostic and treatment of diseases
that change the morphological and functional characteristics of blood vessels [8]. This is due to
the fact that retina is the only organ whose blood vessels can be visualized non-invasively
and directly in vivo.” Should expand on this to provide more motivation, just some additional
details/examples.
“The results of image processing methods are generally in good agreement with source images.”
More specific would be better. It would give the reader a sense of how good is the state-of-the-art.
Is there a lot of room for improvement?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In its current form, the main contribution of this work is devising a method to solve a particular
instance of the L-system inverse problem. However, the accuracy of the method is not
benchmarked against existing methods in the literature whether they are general or specific to
vasculature. It is therefore difficult to assess the real impact of the work. Furthermore, the
applicability of the method to identifying vascular conditions in the eye, as stated in the
conclusions, is merely speculative. The idea of rule similarity comparison is interesting but it is
not developed in any depth. The idea of predicting inaccessible vascular branches in Section 6.4 is
also interesting but lacks any proper validation.
Given the importance of equation (7) for the overall method, the authors should provide formal
definitions of the g functions on the right-hand-side of the equation.
Figure 7 compares graphically a target and a L-system simulated vascular tree. In page 18 line 44,
the authors state that the structures are matched perfectly. This comparison should be
quantitative to be meaningful. The same applies to Figure 10 in the Results section. Note how
equation (7) could be used for this purpose.
In terms of presentation, the paper reads too much like a tutorial. Section 2 introduces L-system
to a level of detail that can be found in other references. Sections 3-6 should be rewritten together
as a single presentation of the method. I do not see the need to take the reader through the step-
by-step derivation of the method.

I’m generally happy with the way the authors have addressed my comments. Providing
quantification of the method accuracy will allow other authors to benchmark any future
developments against this work. Two remaining concerns are:
1) I still believe that the paper falls short when it comes to showing feasibility of the approach for
the identification of vascular conditions in the eye. The authors should, at least, provide a brief
outline of how this can be achieved in the future directions part of the Conclusions.
2) In addition, I would like the authors to emphasise the novelty of the work in the Introduction
by explicitly stating that this is the first time that an algorithm to solve a L-system inverse
problem is proposed in order to obtain parametric growth rules of a target structure.

Dear authors
It is my pleasure to inform you that your paper is basically accepted with minor revisions. Please
take this opportunity to improve the final version of your communication as suggested by the
reviewer, to better emphasise the novelty of your work compared to the state-of-the-art for
solving inverse problems in L-systems, and better discuss the applicability of your approach and
future plans for the morphological analysis of blood vessels in the eye and diagnosis.

I’m generally happy with the way the authors have addressed my comments. Providing
quantification of the method accuracy will allow other authors to benchmark any future
developments against this work. Two remaining concerns are:
15
1) I still believe that the paper falls short when it comes to showing feasibility of the approach for
the identification of vascular conditions in the eye. The authors should, at least, provide a brief
outline of how this can be achieved in the future directions part of the Conclusions.
2) In addition, I would like the authors to emphasise the novelty of the work in the Introduction
by explicitly stating that this is the first time that an algorithm to solve a L-system inverse
problem is proposed in order to obtain parametric growth rules of a target structure.

erall, the paper is very well-written. It was almost always easy to follow and
derstand, although there are some areas where more detail could be provided
the writing could be made clearer. There are no significant typos or grammatical
ors that would affect a reader’s ability to understand the paper. In general, the
ical flow is well done although I do find sometimes the authors present
mething and then explain it, which can be a bit confusing. The authors should
nsider re-ordering some of their explanations just so that it is clearer. The paper
scientifically valid. The research methodology is clearly expressed. The results
described qualitatively, which is a bit of weakness to the paper since there are
ll-known metrics for analyzing these results (the authors even mention them in
paper). The authors provide a few examples, but they claim to have analyzed
er 100 images so some quantitative analysis would be better. The conclusions
match the results, although again with only a few examples provide, the
nclusions are not particularly strong.
e authors would like to thank the respected reviewer for endorsement of our work. We
d our best to address the concerns of the reviewer as below.
<U+F0B7> As it is shown in section 4.1.1 with an illustrative example, pixel-by-pixel
comparison and related metrics such as accuracy, specificity, and selectivity are
not appropriate for driving the growth rules from a target structure which is our goal
in this work. But, we have now provided above mentioned well-known metrics
along with the values of our proposed fitness function elements to compare the
results of proposed algorithm with target structure, quantitatively. Added sections
are as follow:
Paragraph 1 of page 20:
“To express the results quantitatively based on Eq. (7), the pixels that belong to
the branch in the target image and that are simulated correctly, are counted as true
positives (TP), otherwise they are counted as false negatives (FN). The pixels that
belong to the background and that are simulated as branch, are counted as false
positives (FP), otherwise they are counted as true negatives (TN). Accuracy,
sensitivity, and specificity are well-known metrics for pixel-by-pixel comparison [14]
defined as follows:
<U+0001D447><U+0001D443> + <U+0001D447><U+0001D441>
<U+0001D434><U+0001D450><U+0001D450> =
<U+0001D447><U+0001D443> + <U+0001D447><U+0001D441> + <U+0001D439><U+0001D443> + <U+0001D439><U+0001D441> (22)
<U+0001D447><U+0001D443>
<U+0001D446><U+0001D452> =
<U+0001D447><U+0001D443> + <U+0001D439><U+0001D441>

<U+0001D446><U+0001D45D> =
<U+0001D447><U+0001D441> + <U+0001D439><U+0001D443>
The values of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, <U+0001D454>^<U+0001D43B> (<U+0001D460><U+0001D461><U+0001D45F><U+0001D461> , <U+0001D460><U+0001D461><U+0001D45F><U+0001D460> ), <U+0001D454>^<U+0001D43A> (<U+0001D460><U+0001D461><U+0001D45F><U+0001D461> , <U+0001D460><U+0001D461><U+0001D45F><U+0001D460> ), and
<U+0001D454>^<U+0001D443> (<U+0001D460><U+0001D461><U+0001D45F><U+0001D461> , <U+0001D460><U+0001D461><U+0001D45F><U+0001D460> ), resulted from comparison of target and simulated branches, are
provided in Table 5.”
Paragraph 3 of page 24:
“Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and fitness function values for simulated and
predicted branches in both cases, are given in Table 11. As mentioned in section
6, COSFIRE algorithm was used to extract blood vessels in the first step.
Performance of the COSFIRE algorithm which was used in the first step of
proposed algorithm, affects the results of simulation performance with regard to
accuracy, specificity and selectivity metrics. As shown in Table 11, the accuracy
and specificity are not changed significantly compared to the segmentation step
(COSFIRE results). Sensitivity of the simulated and predicted results are far less
than segmentation result due to the limitations imposed by obtained growth rules.
However, unlike image processing methods, the proposed algorithm has the
capability to obtain the structure growth rules, if any exists.”
<U+F0B7> Similarity of the growth rules of the retinal blood vessels for twelve cases (brought
in data availability section) are shown in Table 10. Also, application of the obtained
rules to predict the inaccessible parts are provided for 2 cases in section 7. So, it
was concluded that the proposed algorithm can be used as a tool, in a richer
database to provide more details about our findings.
The Introduction is excellent. It is well-written and establishes the authors
rk in the context of literature very well. Existing works are explained well and
authors cover most of the key works in pertaining to their research. There are
o small areas for improvement: The authors could expand slightly on why image
a/modelling is useful by perhaps providing a concrete example.
ew example applications are now added to paragraph 2, page 2, as below:
tinal blood vessel extraction and modeling has found applications in automatic early
ease diagnosis and monitoring such as diabetic retinopathy, hypertensive retinopathy,
d branch retinal vein occlusion [10], evaluation and optimization of eye nutrient,
gen, and drug delivery [11,12], as well as examination of the factors affecting retinal
cularization and angiogenesis [13].”
The authors could provide some extra detail on how good are the existing
proaches in a more concrete way, i.e. how accurate are existing approaches?
mentioned in paragraph 1 of page 3 “Performance of image processing approaches
be evaluated and compared with indexes such as sensitivity, specificity, and
2
uracy”. The following explanation based on [14] which is a review article on image
cessing methods, was added to this paragraph in order to address your issue:
e results of image processing methods are generally in good agreement with source
ges which typically have an accuracy of more than 0.8, a sensitivity of more than 0.6
d a selectivity of more than 0.9 [14].”
Section 2 on L-systems is well-explained. Although very minor, the authors
uld expand slightly on the parametric elements for the parametric D0L-system,
ce some readers may not be familiar with it. Currently, the authors only state
t there is a set of formal parameters. The example helps to illustrate but it could
explained in a bit more detail.
spite the fact that, we could go through in-depth explanation of the L-System and its
responding issues, for the sake of brevity and due to space limitation, we just
cribed the fundamental issues which are necessary and required to establish the
posed algorithm. It should be noted that other reviewer(s) claim that some part of the
nuscript has a style of tutorial material and should be revised to make it more concise
d right to the point. In order to keep such a balance, we took such a style in the
lanation and description of various techniques and concepts used in our proposed
orithm. However, various references have been mentioned which can be referred for
her details and In order to address your concern, we added an explanation about
ameters based on your advice in paragraph 3 of page 6, as below:
ually, parameters represent the length and angle dimensions which can be varied in
h rewriting step through nonlinear or linear functions.”
Section 3 is well-done. Authors should expand on the parameters in their
ample so that it can be more easily understood by the reader.
we mentioned in section 2, “L-system symbols which were used in this work for retinal
culature modeling, are shown in Table 1.” We added more information about symbols
d parameters after Eq. (3), as below:
which <U+0001D439>(<U+0001D451>) represents a line of length <U+0001D451> and ±(<U+0001D6FF>) denotes rotation by angle <U+0001D6FF>.”
Section 4. I didn’t understand the paragraph from lines 43 to the next page line
where they are describing equation (5) very well without re-reading several
es. It might be more helpful to re-order the explanation and describe the
habet and such first.
e following sentences have been added to the manuscript (from paragraph 1 to
agraph 3 of page 9) to address your concern, the revised section is as follows

ationship between predecessor and successor parameters. To have a meaningful L-
tem, axiom and predecessor alphabet (<U+0001D447>') could not be null (Ø). So, this is why <U+0001D447>' was
sidered as the superset of <U+0001D447> which shows successor alphabet.
Section 4.1.1. Although I agree with the authors’ points in the next section on
ture matching, it is not entirely clear why a pixel-by-pixel fitness function is
ppropriate if the goal is to reproduce input imagery. Can the authors expand on
s?
we mentioned in section 4, our goal is to obtain L-system rules with a set of general
ameters that can provide a good approximate of the target structure. So, the simulated
ucture is the result of L-system rules and parameters manipulation. In some situations,
el-by-pixel comparison results in an inappropriate solution candidate in optimization
cess. The example in section 4.1.1 has been modified to make it clearer why pixel-by-
el comparison fails to solve L-system inverse problem as below:
nsider the L-system introduced in Example 1 (Figure 3(a)). As was shown in Figure
changing axiom parameters while keeping the same rules, which leads to the same
ucture with different scale (Figure 3(b)) and orientation (Figure 3(c)), pixel-by-pixel
mparison gives inappropriate fitness scores comparing to those of another structure
h a different rules set provided in Figure 3(d).”
4
ure 1 Failure of pixel-by-pixel comparison of (a) <U+0001D434>(100,90°) with (b) <U+0001D434>(50,90°) and (c)
(100,45°) having the same rules defined in Example1 and with (d) <U+0001D434>(100,90°) which
has a different rule
gure 3 shows that the main problem with the pixel-by-pixel comparison is that
culated scores do not provide an insight into morphological similarity between two
uctures.”
Section 4.1.3. I’m not sure what this means “Also, every graphical structure
s an L-system representation in the format of one final parametric string.”
revised paragraph 2 of page 12, to the following:
previously noted, there are algorithms which have been proposed to obtain non-
ametric L-system rules, from a string of non-parametric L-system symbols [38]. So, a
ential fitness function for proposed L-system inverse problem could be the comparison
he L-system string obtained from target image (target string) and the string generated
GA (final string). Every graphical structure can be converted to a final string with
erent algorithms [33,47,48] whose graphical interpretation results in the given
phical structure.”
Authors should provide more detail Farooq et al. What did they find exactly?
43] and [44] have an approach to this problem then why does the authors’ work
ed to exist? The authors should expand on the limitations of the existing works
provide some detail more detail on what their approach contributes to solving
se problems.
mentioned above, our goal is to solve L-system inverse problem obtaining parametric
wth rules. [43] and [44] results are limited to convert image to a string of parametric L-
tem symbols as the final string without providing rules whose rewriting results in the
l string. In fact our main objective is coming up with a method whose solution leads
set of rules which generate that final string. Considering Example 1, these algorithms
convert an image to Eq. (2) but cannot obtain Eq. (1) which generates Eq. (2) in a
riting procedure.
mentioned in our algorithms in section 6, the result of [44] was used as the first step
olve L-system inverse problem.
make this clearer in the article, we added following sentence to paragraph 2 of page
5
wever, none of these algorithms can solve L-system inverse problem to obtain
ametric growth rules.”
The text surrounding equation (6) is unclear. Why is it better to find a line of
gth 100 then the appropriate symbols to represent such a string? Four “F”
mbols will produce a very different string when the re-writing rules are applied
n a single “F”.
mentioned in paragraph 2, page 8, Santos and Coelho [38] proposed an algorithm to
ain non-parametric L-system rules from a non-parametric L-system string with
mparing strings. So, a potential fitness function for proposed L-system inverse problem
ld be XOR comparison of the L-system string obtained from target structure (target
ng) and the string generated by GA (final string). In section 4.1.3, the methods which
convert an image to a target string were reviewed. Also, final string matching as the
ess function to solve parametric L-system inverse problem instead of nonparametric,
s investigated.
Example, if F(100) is obtained from target structure, and
5)+(0)F(25)+(0)F(25)+(0)F(25) is generated by GA as final string, XOR comparison of
symbols in these strings leads to inappropriate scores while their graphical
rpretation is completely identical.
sed on the above explanation, the text in section 4.1.3 was revised and changed to the
owing one:
hough XOR comparison of target string against the string generated by GA, can be
pful as the fitness function, it will fail in some situations in parametric L-systems. For
mple, consider the following two simple L-system strings:
<U+0001D439>(100) (6)
<U+0001D439>(25) + (0) <U+0001D439>(25) + (0) <U+0001D439>(25) + (0) <U+0001D439>(25)
imple line with a length of 100 is the graphical interpretation of both strings, but XOR
mparison of alphabets of two strings leads to an inappropriate score.”
“<U+0001D714>1, <U+0001D714>2, and <U+0001D714>3 are weight factors that should be defined properly for each
se” How is this done on a case-by-case basis? What factors determine the
ferent weights? How are the other thresholds determined as well?
ight factors in our work, were obtained via a trial and error procedure, but their
imum values can be found through another optimization process. Structure properties
h as complexity or self-similarity of branches, are typical factors that could affect these
ights. Furthermore, the weight factors can affect optimization convergence and run
e due to shortcomings mentioned for each part of fitness function in section 4.1.
mming distance threshold (<U+0001D70F>) was considered 40 as noted in Example 3 based on [42].
added following description to paragraph 2 of page 14 to address this issue in the
ised manuscript.

e weight factors can affect optimization convergence and run time. In this work, weight
tors were obtained via a trial and error procedure, but their optimum values can be
nd through another optimization process.”
. In equation (10), what are fa,b and fa,c?
e following sentence has been added in the revised manuscript, after Eq. (10) to
dress the concern of respected reviewer:
hich <U+0001D453><U+0001D44E>,<U+0001D44F> and <U+0001D453><U+0001D44E>,<U+0001D450> are differences between Figures 5(a)-5(b), and Figures 5(a)-5(c)
ording to Eq. (9).”
Section 5. With respect to the GA operators, did the authors have any specific
sons for their choices?
e worst individuals were removed based on roulette wheel selection scheme”
unds like a contradiction? Were the worst individuals removed or were
pulation members removed based on a roulette wheel in proportion to their
ess? It sounds like the authors mean the latter.
act the respected reviewer point is valid, what we have used and meant by the roulette
eel selection is what the reviewer mentioned, however, this will lead to the removal of
worst individuals in an implicit manner. In other words, since their chances of selection
the parents of the individuals in the next generation are in proportion to their fitness
ich are not high), they are doomed to get removed throughout the next generations.
Section 6. For equation (13), it may not be clear to the reader where (24,15)
me from, especially the 15 parameter. I see it is explained in the next sentence.
e authors should consider re-ordering this.
as re-ordered in the revised manuscript according to your advice as following:
rther, it was assumed that the axiom length and angle are equivalent to those for the
in root of the target structure. In this case, the length of the main root and its angle
ative to the axis X are 24 and 15, respectively. So, we have:”
: <U+0001D434>(24,15) (13)
For equation (15) and (16), it is not clear how the authors constructed this
ndidate rules. How can they be certain that only the single “F” symbol could be
“A” instead?
ese candidate rules were resulted from optimization process. For the sake of brevity,
y were proposed as the first candidate in the step-by-step solution example.

revised the sentence above Eqs. (15) and (16) as follows:
r the sake of brevity, the following rules resulted from optimization process have been
gested as candidate rules”
“more than hundred fundus images” This could be 101 to many thousands.
ight be better to be more specific.
revised the mentioned sentence to the following in order to address your concern:
investigate the similarity of growth rules of retinal vasculature in different eyes, 108
dus images were analyzed by the algorithm represented in this work.”
With respect to the results, do the L-systems presented re-create the entire
age or just the highlighted areas in the figures? If they do not re-create the entire
age, can the authors expand on how it can re-create the imagery? Would it be
run for each branch?
mentioned in paragraph 3 page 21, results proposed in the article are related to the
cified branches marked with red color in Figure 9. Our proposed algorithm has no
itation to reproduce continuous branches. So, to re-create different branches with
erent growth rules, the algorithm must be run independently.
“It should be noted that in spite of the accuracy of the correlated functions
each growth cycle, they cannot be used for couple of consecutive growth cycle
e to the error propagation and amplification. In other words, the obtained
related functions should be used merely for the prediction purposes.” I’m not
te sure what this means. Can the authors clarify?
hould be noted that the proposed algorithm has no limitation to reconstruct and
ulate segmented vessels, and this is due to the fact that various functions have been
d to give the geometric characteristics (e.g., length and orientation angles) of each
nch. These values are obtained based on the linear functions in each rewriting step.
wever, these functions are merely localized mappings whose results are local
proximations obtained through an optimization approach. In other words, characteristic
ues have not been modeled and expressed through a detailed phenomenological or
chanistic model. Hence, correlating general parameters (presented in Table 10)
ough these functions to reproduce the whole structure from an axiom through multiple
riting procedure results in loss of accuracy due to the mentioned uncertainty.
In the conclusions, it seems that the authors’ main focus is on prediction of
od vessels. This did not really come through in the Introduction. It seemed that
authors intended to reproduce imagery. That being said, the conclusion that
authors can predict blood vessels matches very well with their results.

e main objective of the work is to obtain parametric L-system rules which leads to the
st similar structure to a target structure (retinal blood vessels). However, using
ained rules to reconstruct inaccessible branches as a predictive manner has been

ts current form, the main contribution of this work is devising a method to solve
articular instance of the L-system inverse problem. However, the accuracy of
method is not benchmarked against existing methods in the literature whether
y are general or specific to vasculature. It is therefore difficult to assess the real
pact of the work. Furthermore, the applicability of the method to identifying
scular conditions in the eye, as stated in the conclusions, is merely speculative.
e idea of rule similarity comparison is interesting but it is not developed in any
pth. The idea of predicting inaccessible vascular branches in Section 6.4 is also
eresting but lacks any proper validation.
thank the respected reviewer for his/her precise comments. We tried our best to
dress the requested issues as below. As advised, and elaborated below, major
isions have been now made in the light of the reviewer's suggestions.
should re-emphasize that we proposed an algorithm to solve parametric L-system
erse problem in order to obtain parametric growth rules of a target structure, for the
t time. There is no similar work to compare the performance of our proposed method
d its corresponding results against them. As mentioned in the introduction of
nuscript, due to complicated nature of vascular growth, assumptions used in the
ious model based approaches along with unknown parameters result in an
onsistency between morphological properties of simulated vascular network and
ge data. On the other hand, applying image processing approaches leads to the
mentation of vessels without providing any additional knowledge.
r proposed algorithm, has been applied to obtain parametric L-system rules from a
thetic rule-based structure such as Example 1, successfully. In order to show the real
act of the proposed algorithm, we selected retinal vasculature which is known as a
mplicated subject to modeling. We just showed in this article that our algorithm can be
d as a tool to study vasculature growth rules. If any changes occur in vasculature,
h as curvature or angle changes (vascular condition), due to numerical nature of the
orithm, they will be easily detectable. Furthermore, rule similarity was shown for twelve
es (brought in data availability section) in Table 10 with the coefficient of determination
square) values. The growth rules, coefficients, and similarity hypothesis can be
dified with a richer database than the one [52] we used.
address the respected reviewer’s comment, we have now presented a quantitative
ex based on our defined fitness function and well-known image processing metrics.
en the importance of equation (7) for the overall method, the authors should
vide formal definitions of the g functions on the right-hand-side of the equation.

have presented definition and weaknesses of <U+0001D488><U+0001D477> , <U+0001D488><U+0001D46F> , and <U+0001D488><U+0001D46E> in sections 4.1.1, 4.1.2,
d 4.1.3, respectively. Furthermore, we provided an example (Example 3) with detailed
re results to make it easy to follow. XOR operator has been used in pixel-by-pixel and
ystem grammar comparison. Image feature matching scores have been calculated
h mean Hamming distance between matched keypoints of the target and simulated
uctures which were detected and described with ORB Algorithm. For the sake of
vity, the details of mentioned algorithms which are all well-defined in literature, were
provided in manuscript.
added following sentences to address your concerns in paragraph 1 of page 14:
penCV C++ library [46] was used to implement XOR algorithm for pixel-by-pixel
mparison and ORB algorithm for mean Hamming distance calculation between
tched keypoints. Also, bitwise XOR operation for grammar comparison was
lemented in our C++ platform [39].”
ure 7 compares graphically a target and a L-system simulated vascular tree. In
ge 18 line 44, the authors state that the structures are matched perfectly. This
mparison should be quantitative to be meaningful. The same applies to Figure
in the Results section. Note how equation (7) could be used for this purpose.
order to address the concern of the respected reviewer about having quantitative
asures of the accuracy of the reconstructed structure and the original one, we used
antitative metrics to measure accuracy, specificity, and selectivity, along with the
ues of fitness function elements in the revised manuscript. As are presented in Table
metrics such as accuracy, specificity, and selectivity are good choices to determine
ge processing performance, but in this manuscript, our main objective was to obtain
wth rules which lead to the best matching structure to the target structure. The values
proposed fitness function elements (Eq. (7)) along with above mentioned metrics are
vided to compare simulated and predicted structures with target structure in fundus
ge, quantitatively. We added the following sections in the revised manuscript to
dress your concern:
Paragraph 1 of page 20:
“To express the results quantitatively based on Eq. (7), the pixels that belong to
the branch in the target image and that are simulated correctly, are counted as true
positives (TP), otherwise they are counted as false negatives (FN). The pixels that
belong to the background and that are simulated as branch, are counted as false
positives (FP), otherwise they are counted as true negatives (TN). Accuracy,
sensitivity, and specificity are well-known metrics for pixel-by-pixel comparison [14]
defined as follows:

provided in Table 5.”
Paragraph 3 of page 24:
“Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and fitness function values for simulated and
predicted branches in both cases, are given in Table 11. As mentioned in section
6, COSFIRE algorithm was used to extract blood vessels in the first step.
Performance of the COSFIRE algorithm which was used in the first step of
proposed algorithm, affects the results of simulation performance with regard to
accuracy, specificity and selectivity metrics. As shown in Table 11, the accuracy
and specificity are not changed significantly compared to the segmentation step
(COSFIRE results). Sensitivity of the simulated and predicted results are far less
than segmentation result due to the limitations imposed by obtained growth rules.
However, unlike image processing methods, the proposed algorithm has the
capability to obtain the structure growth rules, if any exists.”
terms of presentation, the paper reads too much like a tutorial. Section 2
roduces L-system to a level of detail that can be found in other references.
ctions 3-6 should be rewritten together as a single presentation of the method. I
not see the need to take the reader through the step-by-step derivation of the
thod.
spite the fact that, revising the manuscript to address your concern regarding the
oval of the standard materials corresponding to L-System, other reviewer(s)
gested to describe these concepts in more details and even providing more
criptive examples, hence we had to somehow keep a balance between these two
ectations. This is the main reason why the authors have not done any revision in this
ard.

generally happy with the way the authors have addressed my comments.
viding quantification of the method accuracy will allow other authors to
nchmark any future developments against this work.
e authors would like to thank the respected reviewer for re-endorsement of our work.
did our best to address the concerns of the reviewer as below.
I still believe that the paper falls short when it comes to showing feasibility of
approach for the identification of vascular conditions in the eye. The authors
ould, at least, provide a brief outline of how this can be achieved in the future
ections part of the Conclusions.
order to address this issue, the following paragraph has been added to page 26-27:
e algorithm proposed in this work can be used to obtain parametric rules in different
ease stage which affect retinal blood vessels for identification of changes in
rphology of blood vessels. A richer database including both normal and abnormal
dus images with similar growth rules should be applied for further study on the role of
erent diseases in deviating from normal condition. Having the parametric L-system
del in hand, deviation from normal width, length, and tortuosity of retinal blood vessels
e to a disease such as retinopathy of prematurity [56] or diabetic retinopathy [57], can
investigated numerically.”
In addition, I would like the authors to emphasize the novelty of the work in
Introduction by explicitly stating that this is the first time that an algorithm to
ve a L-system inverse problem is proposed in order to obtain parametric growth
es of a target structure.
order to clearly emphasize that such a work is a first algorithmic framework which can
ve a group of specific L-System inverse problems, the following sentence has been
ded to the introduction of the manuscript (paragraph 2 of page 5):
the current work, an algorithm is proposed for the first time to solve this problem and
the parametric growth rules of a target structure.”
