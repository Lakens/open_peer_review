This is a short, interesting study that presents preliminary, but complete, information about how
hiding behavior is influenced by the behavior of commensal organisms. The experimental design
is valid and the statistical analysis is appropriate to my eyes. While I can imagine a number of
additional experiments that might help elucidate some other aspects of this behavioral
relationship, this study should prove interesting for other researchers in this field.

The authors’ manuscript describes a study aimed at determining if the number and/or size of
commensal fish influences behavior of the sea anemone species, which functions as a defensive
refuge. The authors use behavioral measures of anemones exposed to different size and number
of fish to test a hypothesis that the anemones are able to change behaviors (hiding) based on the
configuration of fish. The behavioral measures were conducted over approx. 1 week in natural
populations. I found some of the manuscript difficult to follow and unclear on some of the data
as presented or analyzed. These comments are listed below:
- The authors description of the repeated observations of anemones (3 times over 6 days) and the
results should be more fully developed. This is an important set of data for at least two reasons:
3
1) if repeatable over individuals over time then suggests a stable behavior and 2) if anemones are
consistently harboring the same fish (size and number) provides more support for general
application despite the small number of observations reported in this study. The data in Figure 2
suggest the observations over time are quite variable due to intersecting lines. This variability
over observations is further supported when looking at Supplemental Table 3 where the size and
number of fish associated with a particular anemone is quite variable on different days. I find
this concerning about the ability to interpret the results due to this variation and encourage the
authors to more thoroughly explain these results.
- It appears that the authors do not have any measurements of size or shape of the anemones
themselves. Anemone size (specifically oral disc) would seem to be important for both the fish it
can harbor as well as the time to relax to expose the tentacle crown. Can the authors provide
these data and put into the model?
- The Ha'apiti site could be emphasized (and I think should be) more in the analysis and
interpretation of the data from Opunohu. In Supplemental Table 3, the observations from these
individuals that are not associated with fish have a range of responses that are quite broad and
overlapping with the anemones associated with fish at Opunohu. How would the authors
explain this? Also, is it known why anemones at Ha'apiti are not associated with fish? Are the
fish just not there or are these anemones potentially poor habitats?
- Figure 1: The authors could provide the statistics for these regressions into the figure to make
the manuscript easier to follow.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors’ manuscript describes a study aimed at determining if the number
and/or size of commensal fish influences behavior of the sea anemone species,
which functions as a defensive refuge. The authors use behavioral measures of
anemones exposed to different size and number of fish to test a hypothesis that
the anemones are able to change behaviors (hiding) based on the configuration
of fish. The behavioral measures were conducted over approx. 1 week in natural
populations. I found some of the manuscript difficult to follow and unclear on
some of the data as presented or analyzed. These comments are listed below:
- The authors description of the repeated observations of anemones (3 times
over 6 days) and the results should be more fully developed. This is an
important set of data for at least two reasons: 1) if repeatable over individuals
over time then suggests a stable behavior and 2) if anemones are consistently
harboring the same fish (size and number) provides more support for general
application despite the small number of observations reported in this study. The
data in Figure 2 suggest the observations over time are quite variable due to
intersecting lines. This variability over observations is further supported when
looking at Supplemental Table 3 where the size and number of fish associated
with a particular anemone is quite variable on different days. I find this
concerning about the ability to interpret the results due to this variation and
encourage the authors to more thoroughly explain these results.
Response: There is certainly variability but we believe that the statistical
methods we used are specifically designed to help us identify patterns and the
specific nature of the patterns. In our case we found that anemones differed in
their hiding times. In our experience, these sorts of variables are often much
more variable and the fact that we were able to identify consistent effects should
be reassuring rather than troubling. Because we too were concerned about non-
identical fish counts, we calculated and reported the intraclass correlation
coefficient (a measure of repeatability) for our fish counts in the first line of the
section “Consistency in anemone response behaviour”. The ICC was extremely
high—0.84 suggesting that despite some variation, fish counts were remarkably
repeatable. For this reason, we trust the results on the effect of fish number. We
are certainly willing to add more prose to discuss this but need guidance from the
editor.
It appears that the authors do not have any measurements of size or shape of
the anemones themselves. Anemone size (specifically oral disc) would seem to
be important for both the fish it can harbor as well as the time to relax to expose
the tentacle crown. Can the authors provide these data and put into the model?
Response: This is a valid point. We measured the maximum diameter of the
anemone as a measure of anemone size. In retrospect, it would have been better
to measure the oral disk but we neglected to do that. We previously explored the
effects of size and found that it either had no effect, or it didn’t improve our
models. Specifically, for each and every mixed effects model we fitted, a model
without size added always had a lower AIC value; in 4/6 analyses the difference
was > 2; in the two cases it wasn’t it was 1.4 and 1.7. Thus, from this, we had
generally concluded that size shouldn’t be included in the models. We report
these results in the supplementary material.
The analyses reported in figure 1 are a bit more complex. The initial time to relax
(Fig. 1a) is not influenced by anemone size, but the time to complete relaxation is
(Fig. 1d). If we look at the effect of size and the latency to first fish return (Figs.
1b, 1e), by adding size the models become non-significant and there is no
significant effect of size. If we look at the effect of size and the latency to all fish
return (Figs. 1c, 1f), by adding size the models become non-significant and there
is no significant effect of size. We report these results in the supplementary
material but given the overall pattern (that adding size is not better, and indeed
makes models worse), we believe that it is appropriate to ignore size in the
current analyses we report in the paper so as to keep the message focused. We
have, however, added a paragraph in the discussion clarifying this.
The Ha'apiti site could be emphasized (and I think should be) more in the
analysis and interpretation of the data from Opunohu.
Response: We now added a paragraph in the discussion explaining the issues
associated with site. “Strictly, because all anemones at the Opunohu site were
associated with fish, while none that the Ha’apiti site were, it was not possible to
statistically isolate any effects of site on anemone response. We do not know
why there were no fish associated with the anemones at the Ha’apiti site. Both
the anemones, and the site itself appeared healthy. Future studies, at more sites,
will be required to better understand the effects of site variation on anemone
antipredator behaviour.”
In Supplemental Table 3, the observations from these individuals that are not
associated with fish have a range of responses that are quite broad and
overlapping with the anemones associated with fish at Opunohu. How would the
authors explain this?
Response: We agree that the data are variable. Ultimately the statistical
analyses we employed allow us to identify the key factors that explain this
variation. In our case, the number and behavior of fish explained significant
variation in the latency for the anemone to relax. This was by no means a ‘perfect’
relationship, but nonetheless, was a significant relationship.
Also, is it known why anemones at Ha'apiti are not associated with fish? Are the
fish just not there or are these anemones potentially poor habitats?
Response: Great question! We do not know why there were no fish at the
Ha’apiti site. It was really interesting: there were many more anemone here than
at Opunohu, but no anemone fish! The anemone appeared healthy, as did the
site. We now discuss this in the discussion.
Figure 1: The authors could provide the statistics for these regressions into the
figure to make the manuscript easier to follow.
Response: Added.
