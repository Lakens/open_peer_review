Comments on “Monitoring Cues Do Not Predict Donations to Charity Online” (RSOS-150710)
This manuscript reports on a study that investigated the replicability of the watching-eyes effect.
Using an online crowdsourcing platform (Amazon MTurk), the authors collected data from over
1,500 participants. Participants first completed a series of questionnaires (e.g., religiosity,
demographic variables), earning US$0.20 for the completion of the questionnaires. They also
earned a bonus of $0.08, and were allowed to donate some portion of the bonus to UNICEF.
During this second phase, the experimental manipulation (i.e., exposure to a face, a group of
faces, watching-eyes, a group of eyes, or a control stimulus) was introduced. Contrary to past
studies reporting the watching-eyes effect, the results indicate that watching-eyes and related
stimuli (e.g., emotional faces) did not facilitate altruistic behaviour (charitable giving in this
experiment). Despite these non-significant results associated with the watching-eyes effect, the
authors still observed a number of expected associations between charitable giving and known
predictors (i.e., culture, past charitable giving, sex, age). Because of the large sample size and
successful replication of non-focal associations, this study can be treated as counter-evidence
against the watching-eyes effect. Considering that the Royal Society Open Science accepts
negative findings, I recommend this manuscript to be published in RSOS. However, I have a mild
concern about the method of this study. If the authors find my concern reasonable, they might
want to mention it as an additional explanation for their non-significant results.
In this study, the authors asked their participants to complete various measures before the giving
game. Some of the items seem to induce a sense of being monitored by someone. For example,
their measures included the following items: ‘God, or some other supreme being, is watching
over me’, ‘The police make my world safe’, and ‘I usually worry about making a good
impression’. If these items in fact increased participants’ sense of being monitored, it could be
possible that an already-heightened sense of being monitored selectively eliminated the
watching-eyes effect (i.e., rendered eye-related stimuli ineffective) while retaining the other
effects that are not related to the watching-eyes effect. I would like to hear the authors’ opinions
about this potential problem. Personally, I consider that if such a minor change in the
experimental procedure, namely the introduction of some self-report items, could eliminate the
watching-eyes effect, this should be acknowledged in this literature. Although this study did not
test the effect of these items on the watching-eyes effect, future meta-analyses may consider the
effect of any reminder of ‘being monitored’ prior to the measure of altruistic behaviour. This
possibility, to the extent that it is valid, suggests that the watching-eyes effect might be better
subsumed under a more general effect of evaluation apprehension.
Minor point
On page 13, the authors mention ‘Table Five’ (3rd line from the bottom). However, I do not see
Table 5. Please include Table 5 in the revised manuscript.

Dear Dr Taylor:
Manuscript ID RSOS-150710.R1 entitled "A range of monitoring cues do not predict online
donations to charity in an MTurk sample" which you submitted to Royal Society Open Science,
has been reviewed. The comments of the reviewer(s) are included at the bottom of this letter and
in an attachment. I would particularly like to highlight the very helpful and thorough comments
of Reviewer 2. Reviewer 2 is concerned that their earlier comments were not adequately
addressed, but wonders if this may have been partly due to the fact that it was not entirely clear
what they were after. I hope that the extremely thoughtful suggestions of the reviewer will help
you improve the paper to a format that we can accept. The reviewer is batting for you and wants
to see these data published.
Please submit a copy of your revised paper within three weeks (i.e. by the

This is a very useful report. I thank the authors for their efforts and for considering my criticism. I
recommend acceptance. I offer the comments below for the authors and editor to consider for any
last little revisions before publication.
-- I think that all claims made in an abstract require a very clear rationale and I still don't see how
"this work supports the importance of culture." Again, "culture" is defined in here as nation of
origin, and the "importance" of country of origin to the present results is not obvious and not
explained, beyond a US vs. India difference. I still don't really even know what "culture" means in
this context -- why not just say country of origin/residence? (In contrast, I do agree that "this
work supports the importance of ... enduring individual differences in prosocial behaviour" -
- I understand what this claim means.)
-- The new introduction of the variation in eyes images is very helpful! For #2 (abstract vs
realism), there have been a wider variety of abstract images previously used than is currently
mentioned. And it isn't clear to me how #4 derives from the legacy hypothesis.
-- The authors assert (line 442) that University participant pools participants are highly
experienced, but it is hard to imagine their relevant experience is anything close to MTurk
workers.
-- The authors may wish to see a recent meta-analysis of this literature -- Northover et al, in press
at Evolution and Human Behavior.

ate, I'm not aware of any previous research finding an effect of images that include multiple faces
tiple pairs of eyes, and the authors have not provided any theoretical reason to expect this

on group pictures reduces your chance of detecting an effect? If angry eyes are more effective,
t including non-angry eyes waste some of your statistical power and thereby reduce the chance of

ct? If the sex of the eyes might matter, why not test for that? Was there a separate analysis of the
stimuli that have previously been shown to have effects, excluding your novel stimuli? So the
l issue is whether effective stimuli could be overlooked because the analysis strategy grouped
n with ineffective stimuli. These are important questions when the title claim of the manuscript—
ct of monitoring cues—is based on an analysis in which all the monitoring stimuli were
ned without regard for variation in stimuli, and without any theory-guided discussion of why any
variation made it more (or less) likely that an effect would be detected.

causal factor influencing charity. Measuring mood after a donation decision is parsimoniously
eted as measuring how charitable behavior affects mood, not the reverse. This example
tes the general importance of carefully carefully considering these kinds of design issues, even
there are no big claims made here about mood specifically. But, one of the central empirical
is that demographics variables are important predictors of behavior whereas eye images aren't. If
rstand correctly, at least some of those demographic questions were asked at the beginning,
ng some that had the strongest relationship to donations. So, a participant is asked to identify her
n, political ideology, ethnicity, etc. right up front, and then those variables turn out to be an
ant influence on a charitable decision. Could those demographic questions have acted as a
Counterbalancing the order of the demographics and the DV would best address this concern. If

note that your qualification criteria seemed to interact with the DV. How should we interpret
rn 3: Inappropriate generalizations
ntral and title claim of this work is no effect “online.” Is this really about online methods? Only
urk environment has been sampled and no generalizing beyond Mturk has not been defended.
are unique features of Mturk that may explain a null effect and undermine the generalization to
e.” Mturk workers probably spend lots of time on the Internet, presumably being exposed to
isements designed to affect their behavior, perhaps building a resistance that could undermine the
mental stimuli. Mturk workers take lots of surveys and play lots of economic games. Some of
Rand's recent work suggests the decision-making of highly-experienced participants could
e automatic and resistant to experimental interference. So the null effect could be driven by non-
participants, not by online methods per se.
er aspect of the title claim is that there are no effect of “monitoring cues.” If the eyes effect is
tically related to reputation, as I and other have argued, then we have to consider how reputation
onitoring manifest in an Mturk environment. The authors note that previous studies have shown
es effects is stronger when there are fewer real observers of the behavior – presumably this is
e when people are fairly sure that real people could be monitoring them, an additional (invalid)
at they're being monitored provides no useful information about the reputation-relevance of their
t scenario. So, couldn't Mturkers feel like all of their behavior is being monitored, i.e. that their
ion is already on the line at all times? They face numerous cues that they are not operating
mously: They log in to Mturk with a stable ID, they know their IP addresses might be recorded,
now that somehow their Mturk pay is supposed to be linked to their responses and that their work
rejected by dissatisfied employers. A promise of confidentiality in a consent form doesn't just
way all of those types of monitoring cues.
title claim that monitoring cues don't predict donations seems inappropriately broad. What can
med is that a diverse set of invalid visual cues didn't have an effect on Mturker charity. We don't
f the other monitoring cues had an effect (and we don't know if some specific subset of the
visual cues had effects). A more appropriate title may be something like “No evidence that
s kinds of face images influence charity donations by Mturk workers.”
e there are many other ideas about what might explain the null result. I'm not saying that the
s have to engage every one of them. And I'm not saying that the authors need to definitively nail
one explanation or endorse my explanations. But you have some license to speculate more in the
sion. I urge the authors to at least make more effort to situate their results in the rich body of
fic theory about the functional and mechanistic explanations of this eyes effect.
rn 4: “Culture”
stract includes the claim that “this work supports the importance of culture ... in prosocial
our.” Is this claim based entirely on calling a country of origin variable “culture?” 96% of the
was from the US or India. So is the culture claim almost entirely about differences between the
d India? Are ~60 non-US, non-Indian participants driving effects attributed to “culture?” Can we
e that the non-US, non-Indian participants in the sample are fairly representative of their
ies?
lly it seems like there's a strong emphasis on “culture” as an explanation when it isn't at all clear
ulture does any explanatory work here.

Appendix B
Response to reviewers
Review comments below, followed by our responses (in bold)
Reviewer 1:
n this study, the authors asked their participants to complete various measures before the giving
game. Some of the items seem to induce a sense of being monitored by someone. For example,
heir measures included the following items: ‘God, or some other supreme being, is watching
over me’, ‘The police make my world safe’, and ‘I usually worry about making a good
mpression’. If these items in fact increased participants’ sense of being monitored, it could be
possible that an already-heightened sense of being monitored selectively eliminated the
watching-eyes effect (i.e., rendered eye-related stimuli ineffective) while retaining the other
effects that are not related to the watching-eyes effect. I would like to hear the authors’ opinions
about this potential problem. Personally, I consider that if such a minor change in the
experimental procedure, namely the introduction of some self-report items, could eliminate the
watching-eyes effect, this should be acknowledged in this literature. Although this study did not
est the effect of these items on the watching-eyes effect, future meta-analyses may consider the
effect of any reminder of ‘being monitored’ prior to the measure of altruistic behaviour. This
possibility, to the extent that it is valid, suggests that the watching-eyes effect might be better
subsumed under a more general effect of evaluation apprehension.
All of the items that the reviewer refers to here were presented to participants after the
prime and opportunity to donate, so it is not possible that they affected donations. We do
state the order of survey items in the methods, however, the reviewer’s concern suggests we
were not clear enough in our original manuscript. We have therefore included additional
explanation in the methods section to clarify the order of presentation of questions (lines
165-167).
Minor point
On page 13, the authors mention ‘Table Five’ (3rd line from the bottom). However, I do not see
Table 5. Please include Table 5 in the revised manuscript.
We have now included Table 5.
Reviewer 2:
The lack of guiding theory makes it hard to understand some design choices and hard to interpret
he results. There was a “significant” difference in donations between conditions, but pairwise
comparisons couldn't detect it. This odd combination creates the impression that there may be
effects here that were not detected, perhaps because there was no theory guiding the analysis and
design.
It is not true that there was no theory guiding the analysis and design. All of the conditions
we introduce test the importance of features suggested by previous findings or basic
principles of social cognition (see response to the reviewer’s point below). We concede that
our paper is not built around testing a single theory, but we see that as a strength.
Why so many variants in the stimuli? The authors state that to “maximise the chance of finding
an effect in an online context, we tested not only the effect of eyes, but also the effect of the
emotion displayed, the number of watchers, and the cue type (schematic or photograph).” But is
s not at all clear why varying these features is expected to maximize the chance of detecting an
effect. To elaborate, I'm not aware of any previous research finding an effect of images that
nclude multiple faces or multiple pairs of eyes, and the authors have not provided any
heoretical reason to expect this difference to matter. So, if all (or at least the vast majority) of
previously-reported eyes effects were induced with images of a single face, isn't it reasonable to
wonder if spending some of your statistical power on group pictures reduces your chance of
detecting an effect? If angry eyes are more effective, doesn't including non-angry eyes waste
some of your statistical power and thereby reduce the chance of finding an effect? If eyes are
more effective than full faces, why include full faces if the goal is to find an effect? If the sex of
he eyes might matter, why not test for that? Was there a separate analysis of the set of stimuli
hat have previously been shown to have effects, excluding your novel stimuli? So the general
ssue is whether effective stimuli could be overlooked because the analysis strategy grouped
hem in with ineffective stimuli. These are important questions when the title claim of the
manuscript—no effect of monitoring cues—is based on an analysis in which all the monitoring
stimuli were combined without regard for variation in stimuli, and without any theory-guided
discussion of why any of that variation made it more (or less) likely that an effect would be
detected.
This is a selective reading of the rationale for our work. The quote the reviewer provides
here is taken out of context. We state that “In order to identify which features of monitoring
cues are most important for promoting donations [emphasis added], and to maximise the
chance of finding an effect in an online context, we tested not only the effect of eyes, but
also the effect of the emotion displayed, the number of watchers, and the cue type
schematic or photograph).”
The first motivation for including these conditions was to identify, by experimental
manipulation, the most important features of monitoring cues for promoting donations.
Because we failed to find any significant effect of monitoring cues in any of the conditions,
most of our discussion focuses on a second reason to include a diverse range of conditions.
By including a range of conditions in our study, we minimize the chance that we failed to
ind an effect due to our particular combination of stimulus features. As with any
experimental study, there is a trade-off between the number of conditions and statistical
power, however our large MTurk sample meant that we were able to maintain large
sample sizes across each condition. In our study, n is between 100 and 179 for each
condition – more than double the sample size per condition of most previous studies.
Hence, based on previously published effect sizes centering on 0.45, our power to detect a
pairwise effect between our control condition and any one experimental condition at
alpha=0.05 is 0.965-0.991. We now make this clear when discussing statistical power in the
main text (Lines 150-157). We feel strongly that our failure to find an effect across such a
range of conditions is an important finding and justifies our choice of title for the paper.
The choice of features we manipulate was motivated by previous findings and basic
principles of social cognition.
1. We manipulate eyes vs face images because pictures of faces, rather than eyes, have
not been shown to increase prosociality in a dictator game(Baillon, Selim, & Van
Dolder, 2013)
2. We manipulate emotion because previous findings have suggested that emotion may
influence the efficacy of the monitoring cues (Bateson, Nettle, & Roberts, 2006).
3. We manipulate the number of faces/eyes because social cognition is known to be
sensitive to group size (e.g., Brewer & Kramer, 1986; Gerard, Wilhelmy, &
Conolley, 1968).
4. We use abstract and real images because previous work has found a monitoring
effect with only minimal abstract cues (Rigdon et al., 2009), suggesting that a
monitoring cue effect “might be so fully ingrained into unconscious social cognition
that it could be set off by a weak stimulus that carries no realistic basis to a pair of
human eyes (Bentin, Allison, Puce, Perez, & McCarthy, 1996; Kitayama, Snibbe,
Markus, & Suzuki, 2004).” Despite the obvious theoretical implications, the effect of
abstract relative to real images has never been tested.
Finally, we note that whilst we included 11 conditions, we used 34 images in total because
or some conditions (that were not simple schematics) subjects were allocated to one of
several images. We see this “pseudo-replication” replication as another strength of our
study, ensuring that our findings are robust across not just the type of image (e.g. eyes vs
aces) but also across the specific images used. All analyses grouped pseudo-replicates into
one of the 11 conditions, so this did not compromise the power of our statistical analyses.
So, a participant is asked to identify her religion, political ideology, ethnicity, etc. right up front,
and then those variables turn out to be an important influence on a charitable decision. Could
hose demographic questions have acted as a prime? Counterbalancing the order of the
demographics and the DV would best address this concern. If collecting more data is infeasible,
at minimum the order of measures must made very clear and the implication of that order need to
be carefully discussed. Some claims might need to be softened due to these design limitations.
As noted in response to reviewer 1, whilst basic demographics were asked up front,
responses regarding religion, political ideology and values were presented after the prime
and donation opportunity. We now clarify this ordering in the methods section of the
paper (lines 165-167).
also note that your qualification criteria seemed to interact with the DV. How should we
nterpret that?
Whilst DG allocations covaried with qualification, qualification did not emerge as an
mportant predictor in the model selection process – ie. the relationship with DG is likely
due to the effects of some other factor that covaries with DG and qualification, such as
culture, sex or age.
The central and title claim of this work is no effect “online.” Is this really about online methods?
Only the Mturk environment has been sampled and no generalizing beyond Mturk has not been
defended. There are unique features of Mturk that may explain a null effect and undermine the
generalization to “online.” Mturk workers probably spend lots of time on the Internet,
presumably being exposed to advertisements designed to affect their behavior, perhaps building
a resistance that could undermine the experimental stimuli. Mturk workers take lots of surveys
and play lots of economic games. Some of David Rand's recent work suggests the decision-
making of highly-experienced participants could become automatic and resistant to experimental
nterference. So the null effect could be driven by nonnaive participants, not by online methods
per se.
Another aspect of the title claim is that there are no effect of “monitoring cues.” If the eyes effect
s theoretically related to reputation, as I and other have argued, then we have to consider how
eputation and monitoring manifest in an Mturk environment. The authors note that previous
studies have shown that eyes effects is stronger when there are fewer real observers of the
behavior – presumably this is because when people are fairly sure that real people could be
monitoring them, an additional (invalid) cue that they're being monitored provides no useful
nformation about the reputation-relevance of their current scenario. So, couldn't Mturkers feel
ike all of their behavior is being monitored, i.e. that their reputation is already on the line at all
imes? They face numerous cues that they are not operating anonymously: They log in to Mturk
with a stable ID, they know their IP addresses might be recorded, they know that somehow their
Mturk pay is supposed to be linked to their responses and that their work can be rejected by
dissatisfied employers. A promise of confidentiality in a consent form doesn't just wipe away all
of those types of monitoring cues. So, the title claim that monitoring cues don't predict donations
seems inappropriately broad. What can be claimed is that a diverse set of invalid visual cues
didn't have an effect on Mturker charity. We don't know if the other monitoring cues had an
effect (and we don't know if some specific subset of the invalid visual cues had effects). A more
appropriate title may be something like “No evidence that various kinds of face images influence
charity donations by Mturk workers
Whilst we think null findings such as this are valuable contributions to the literature, we
are sensitive to the importance of not overstating our case. We have therefore changed the
itle of our paper to “A range of monitoring cues do not predict online donations to charity
n an MTurk sample”. We believe our filtering mechanism, the response patterns we
observe (e.g. variation between responses, rather than always answering ‘strongly agree’)
and our replication of past studies on the predictors of charity donation indicate that
MTurk practice effects are unlikely to explain our null finding. Nevertheless, we now also
discuss these potential pitfalls of MTurk samples in the discussion (Lines 370-375).
The abstract includes the claim that “this work supports the importance of culture ... in prosocial
behaviour.” Is this claim based entirely on calling a country of origin variable “culture?” 96% of
he sample was from the US or India. So is the culture claim almost entirely about differences
between the US and India? Are ~60 non-US, non-Indian participants driving effects attributed to
“culture?” Can we assume that the non-US, non-Indian participants in the sample are fairly
epresentative of their countries? Basically it seems like there's a strong emphasis on “culture” as
an explanation when it isn't at all clear how culture does any explanatory work here
Yes, as we highlight in the results section, the significant effect of culture/language is due
argely to the difference between English-speaking and South Asian/Tamil speaking
cultures. We now also note in the text that this is due to the make up of the Mturk
population coming mainly from USA and India (Line 285-286). We have not changed the
wording of the abstract since all of the effects referred to are explained in detail in the main
ext.

Below we note the reviewer’s concerns (in black) followed by our responses (in red).
Reviewer: 1
I read the revised manuscript, and found that my previous concern did not apply to the
reported study (i.e., it is now clear that some potentially ‘prime’ questions were
administered after the donation decision). Accordingly, I now consider that this
manuscript is publishable in Royal Society Open Science. Although I spotted some
typos, I believe these can be corrected at the proof-reading stage.
We thank the reviewer for this positive assessment.
Line 271: ‘U.S.A’ should be ‘U.S.A.’
Corrected.
Line 307: ‘table five’ should be ‘table 5’.
Corrected.
The authors use ‘MTurk’ in the title, while use ‘Mturk’ in the main text. ‘MTurk’ is
more common.
Corrected.
Reviewer 2
I want these data to be published, but I have concerns about the way they are
presented and interpreted in the present manuscript. The authors have not adequately
responded to the concerns I raised in my first review. I think part of the reason for that
is that I wasn't very clear, for which I apologize. My extensive comments below could
probably be addressed with minor revisions that restrict the focus on this paper to
applied concerns. That would be a worthy paper, although I'd like to see more major
revisions that engage more thoroughly with the theory in the existing literature on this
topic.
We thank the reviewer for taking the time to so thoroughly outline their concerns and
suggestions for our manuscript. We respond below to the reviewers’ comments.
VARIATION IN STIMULI: WHY WOULD THIS MATTER?
I thank the authors for clarifying their motivations for the variation in stimuli:
"The choice of features we manipulate was motivated by previous findings and basic
principles of social cognition.
1. We manipulate eyes vs face images because pictures of faces, rather than eyes,
have not been shown to increase prosociality in a dictator game (Baillon, Selim, &
Van Dolder, 2013)
2. We manipulate emotion because previous findings have suggested that emotion
may influence the efficacy of the monitoring cues (Bateson, Nettle, & Roberts, 2006).
3. We manipulate the number of faces/eyes because social cognition is known to be
sensitive to group size (e.g., Brewer & Kramer, 1986; Gerard, Wilhelmy, &
Conolley, 1968).
4. We use abstract and real images because previous work has found a monitoring
effect with only minimal abstract cues (Rigdon et al., 2009), suggesting that a
monitoring cue effect "might be so fully ingrained into unconscious social cognition
that it could be set off by a weak stimulus that carries no realistic basis to a pair of
human eyes (Bentin, Allison, Puce, Perez, & McCarthy, 1996; Kitayama, Snibbe,
Markus, & Suzuki, 2004)." Despite the obvious theoretical implications, the effect of
abstract relative to real images has never been tested."
I see that these dimensions of variation are mentioned in the introduction, when they
are introduced it is not clear that your interest is in exploring those specific
dimensions. The paper starts by talking about reputation, suggesting that is the topic,
but never really returns to it. My suggestion would be to make it clear from the start
that you're interested in trying to maximize the effect (for applied reasons?) and that
your approach is to look for relevant axes of variation from previous results.
I think a stronger paper would discuss WHY these axes of variation might matter (i.e.
actually engage with the reputation issue instead of drifting away), but at minimum I
urge some rearranging of the introduction to more easily guide the reader through
applied interest and how previously-reported variation in the effect informed your
design.
The points made in this section are reiterated in the “clarification of ‘no guiding
theory’” heading below and so we address both sections below.
CLARIFICATION OF "NO GUIDING THEORY"
In response to my concern about lack of guiding theory, the authors list 4 motivations
for varying stimuli characteristics based on previous finding. Missing from the
introduction, discussion, and review correspondence is any talk of WHY these
dimensions might be relevant. Why would a face be less effective than just eyes
(point 1)? Why would the emotion of the face matter (point 2)? Why does group size
matter to social cognition in general, and is group size the same thing as lots of fake
eyes (point 3)? What are the obvious theoretical implications of minimal cues (point
4)? That is what I mean when I say the authors haven't engaged with the theory that
motivates much of this literature. I believe them that they considered various theories
when they designed the methods, but there is basically no discussion of that in the
paper! I cannot evaluate if the methods were well-designed in light the theoretical
perspective(s) if there's no explanation.
I want to emphasize that I applaud the authors for a serious effort to explore many
dimensions of variation in stimuli and for reporting a null result instead of burying it
in a file drawer. But the introduction and interpretation of these results are still very
muddled to me, and it looks to me like that is because of a shallow engagement with
the theory. Much of this literature is aimed at the question of WHY the eyes effects
happens (or doesn't) and what it implies about human psychology. I don't really gain
paper is written, and the title strikes me as misleading on the matter.
While I think this paper would be more valuable if the authors do fully engage with
this type of theory, I can imagine a useful contribution based purely on the applied
goal of finding the most effective stimuli to harness this effect: "Boosting prosociality
is useful. Eyes sometimes do that. Here's variation in the effect in existing literature.
Here's how we tested variation along those lines. We found none of it works. Here are
the applied implications. We leave it to others to interpret what this means for
building theory about reputation, cue use, psychology of prosociality, etc."
Our study was designed based on both applied and theoretical motivations and so we
are reluctant to pitch the paper as entirely applied in focus. We designed the study in
the way we did to tease apart the important monitoring cue dimensions based on
theory and prior inconsistent findings. The reason we did not include a lengthy
exposition of the various theoretical arguments behind the different monitoring cues
we used is because in the end our null result across all cues did not allow us to test
between the different theoretical predictions. Detailed exposition of the different
theories therefore seemed superfluous, especially since the theory is explained in
detail elsewhere in the literature. Nevertheless, as suggested by the reviewer, to make
the motivation of our study design clearer, we have now added a section at the end of
the introduction that provides theoretical justifications for each of the primes we
selected (Lines 60-99).
We agree with the reviewer that a failure to find an effect of a range of monitoring
cues on MTurk is useful as an applied piece of research. However, we do not see
these results as of ‘purely applied’ value. The lack of a hypothesized effect in a given
context across a broad range of primes is something that theorists need to account for.
We now clarify the implications and limitations of our null findings in more detail in
the discussion (Lines 365-421).
TRAITS OF MTURK WORKERS AND UNCONTROLLED MONITORING CUES
OF MTURK METHODS
Reviewer 1 raised the same conceptual concern as I did, namely that aspects of these
methods could have introduced enough concern for reputation among participants that
the fake cue of observation was redundant (consistent with numerous reports in this
literature whereby real observation swamps the effect of the fake observation). The
authors note that the specific reputation-concern-inducing items mentioned by
Reviewer 1 came after the IV and DV, so that specific concern has been addressed.
We are glad this concern has been addressed to the satisfaction of both reviewers.
But this general concern remains-Turkers' behavior is highly scrutinized and they
know it!
In my first review I explained it this way:
"There are unique features of Mturk that may explain a null effect and undermine the
generalization to "online." Mturk workers probably spend lots of time on the Internet,
presumably being exposed to advertisements designed to affect their behavior,
workers take lots of surveys and play lots of economic games. Some of David Rand's
recent work suggests the decision making of highly-experienced participants could
become automatic and resistant to experimental interference. So the null effect could
be driven by nonnaive participants, not by online methods per se.we have to consider
how reputation and monitoring manifest in an Mturk environment. The authors note
that previous studies have shown that eyes effects is stronger when there are fewer
real observers of the behavior •presumably this is because when people are fairly
sure that real people could be monitoring them, an additional (invalid) cue that
they're being monitored provides no useful information about the reputation-
relevance of their current scenario. So, couldn't Mturkers feel like all of their
behavior is being monitored, i.e. that their reputation is already on the line at all
times? They face numerous cues that they are not operating anonymously: They log in
to Mturk with a stable ID, they know their IP addresses might be recorded, they know
that somehow their Mturk pay is supposed to be linked to their responses and that
their work can be rejected by dissatisfied employers. A promise of confidentiality in a
consent form doesn't just wipe away all of those types of monitoring cues. So, the title
claim that monitoring cues don't predict donations seems inappropriately broad.
What can be claimed is that a diverse set of invalid visual cues didn't have an effect
on Mturker charity. We don't know if the other monitoring cues had an effect (and we
don't know if some specific subset of the invalid visual cues had effects). A more
appropriate title may be something like "No evidence that various kinds of face
images influence charity donations by Mturk workers."
The authors have not adequately engaged this point. Their response is:
"Whilst we think null findings such as this are valuable contributions to the literature,
we are sensitive to the importance of not overstating our case. We have therefore
changed the title of our paper to "A range of monitoring cues do not predict online
donations to charity in an MTurk sample". We believe our filtering mechanism, the
response patterns we observe (e.g. variation between responses, rather than always
answering 'strongly agree') and our replication of past studies on the predictors of
charity donation indicate that MTurk practice effects are unlikely to explain our null
finding. Nevertheless, we now also discuss these potential pitfalls of MTurk samples
in the discussion (Lines 370-375)."
First, I completely agree that these are valuable findings. I think they would make a
more valuable contribution to the literature if they are clearly and thoroughly situated
in the theory and findings of relevant literature. This does not seem to be a priority in
the current version of the manuscript, which seems more concerned with figuring out
what kinds of eyes will be most effective for applied purposes. Maybe it is fine to
restrict the emphasis, but then much of the introduction and discussion needs to be
restricted accordingly.
As noted above, we now include additional theoretical justification for the primes
used in our study and clarify the implications and limitations of our findings in the
discussion (Lines 365-421).
Second, I appreciate the authors' concern for not overstating their case; the new title is
an improvement. But I still think the title should restrict "monitoring cues" further -
"invalid cues of visual monitoring" is more accurate. We simply do not know the
function of the MTurk methodology, and, further, there is good reason to suspect that
different kinds of monitoring cues have interactive effects: real monitoring has been
repeatedly reported to drown out the effect of invalid monitoring cues, as the authors
note. A paper that claims to be about null effects of monitoring cues should not just
ignore all the monitoring cues except the experimental ones.
Regarding the title, we think referring to ‘invalid cues of visual monitoring’ is
confusing because ‘invalid cues’ is not a standard term used in the literature and it is
not clear in what sense they are invalid. No title can capture all the subtlety of a result.
We have changed the title to “No evidence that a range of artificial monitoring cues
influence online donations to charity in an MTurk sample”. We think that this
appropriately qualifies the context (online MTurk donations) and scope (artificial cues
rather than actual monitoring and a range of visual cues, rather than all cues) of the
findings. This will be further clarified for anyone who reads the manuscript.
Third, my concern about MTurk experience is *not* that participants just mindlessly
click option #4 every time. My concern is that Turkers are so frequently asked the
same kinds of questions that they respond to them intuitively and automatically, in
ways that are resistant to cue-based subtle adjustments. See Rand et al (2014,
doi:10.1038/ncomms4677). See our argument in the discussion of Sparks & Barclay
(2013, doi:466 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2013.05.001).
That the current authors find stable traits of the decisions-makers do predict their
behavior does not undermine the concern that these highly experienced experimental
subjects may have developed a resistance to letting invalid cues alter their typical
behavior-quite the opposite. The authors' results are exactly what one would expect if
experienced participants develop automated response tendencies: only long-term
stable traits matter.
The finding that there are stable predictors of game play does address one concern
regarding experience – it shows that participants were responding in meaningful ways
rather than rapid random responses or without reading questions – but we agree the
existence of stable predictors does not rule out all experience effects.
We now explicitly discuss the potential for experience effects in the discussion, citing
Rand and Sparks & Barclay. We note that the same concerns can be (and often are)
raised with regards to the standard participant pool in psychology – western
undergraduate students. We agree MTurk participants may be even more experienced
(as Rand’s study shows) but this is across a diverse range of research/survey designs.
We state in the paper the perennial methodological limitation that it is unclear to what
extent our findings generalise beyond our sample, but note the demographic and
cultural diversity of MTurk subjects has advantages over the standard western
undergraduate sample that makes up most of psychology (line 397-405).
Fourth, I find this new language a bit confusing:
"Given that Raihani and Bshary's study involved an economic game and our study
involved subjects actually donating their 349 earnings to charity, the weak or
negative monitoring effects found across both studies may be 350 due to the online
or charity donation)."
We have now completely reworded this section to make it clearer (Lines 380-383).
ORDER EFFECTS
In my first review, I wrote:
So, a participant is asked to identify her religion, political ideology, ethnicity, etc.
right up front, and then those variables turn out to be an important influence on a
charitable decision. Could those demographic questions have acted as a prime?
The authors responded by pointing to their response to Reviewer #1's concern that
many items might have primed a feeling of observation. The authors address this
concern by clarifying the order of measures. But that actually was not the same
concern I had-I apologize for my imprecision and will clarify.
The authors claim "the control variables of culture, age, sex, and previous charity
giving frequency did predict donations." All of these variables except previous giving
were asked as part of the screening process. So the kind of "priming" I'm concerned
about is that participants were clued that the study was about associating their
screening demographics with the subsequent measure of behavior. They may have felt
that they were representing their demographic groups. Could the participants infer
that the demographics were part of a screener? (E.g. did the HIT advertisement
mention the possibility of a bonus payment 4x the base wage?) If so, this concern
grows.
Unless the screener was obvious, I personally suspect that this is unlikely and think
that the automated responding tendency I discuss elsewhere is more likely to explain
the relationship between stable traits and behavior. But I think the fact that your most
important predictors were the first things you asked sure looks like a priming
phenomenon, enough that this should be discussed in the manuscript.
We agree this is unlikely and note that asking about demographics before dependent
measures is fairly standard, including in studies of monitoring effects.
QUALIFICATION / ELIMINATION
My concern:
"I also note that your qualification criteria seemed to interact with the DV. How
should we interpret that?"
Author reply:
"Whilst DG allocations covaried with qualification, qualification did not emerge as an
important predictor in the model selection process -ie. the relationship with DG is
likely due to the effects of some other factor that covaries with DG and qualification,
such as culture, sex or age."
confusing that results include some people who did not "qualify" (presumably based
on something other than failed reading).
But let me clarify this issue. I'm talking about eliminating some participants, biasing
the sample.
The authors report that a significant fraction of participants failed the screener test
that "simply required English proficiency and taking time to read the passage before
choosing an answer." Those participants did not complete the study. Since English
proficiency is widely required for MTurk work, and since authors report that their
participants had to have successfully completed previous HITS, it seems safe to
assume that many participants who were eliminated had behaved uncooperatively
rather than misunderstanding. So, the sample of participants here is biased towards
the cooperative types-those most willing to take risks with their reputations have been
filtered out.
It may be the case that a large fraction of people don't condition their cooperation on
cues that reputation is relevant (i.e. the eyes effect could be driven by a minority of
the population), and it seems like the screening process biased the sample in that
direction.
We included the screening criteria as best practice to eliminate bots and ensure as
much as possible that participants are reading questions and responding thoughtfully
(Mason & Suri, 2012). The scenario outlined above is speculative – it requires that
most of those failing our screening task are real people (not bots), that they fail
because they are trying to respond without properly reading the questions (not
because they don’t understand the question), and that those who are responding in this
way are dispositionally less cooperative than others, to the extent that, were they to
have participated, they would have generated an effect of monitoring cues that is not
detectable in the rest of the MTurk population. We have no way of knowing how
many of our respondents were bots, had difficulty with English or were responding
thoughtlessly, but we think it is unlikely that our sample is heavily biased in the way
the reviewer suggests. Again, similar problems arise for other forms of recruitment –
e.g. paying undergraduates to participate in studies. Despite this, we now note the
reviewers’ concern as a possibility in the discussion (Lines 395-397).
Here's a timely new paper:
Zhou & Fishback (2016). The Pitfall of Experimenting on the Web: How Unattended
Selective Attrition Leads to Surprising (Yet False) Research Conclusions. Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology.
This effect is highly unlikely to explain our findings because (in line with the
recommendations in this paper) our experimental manipulations are equal in terms of
factors likely to affect attrition rates (all we vary is an image presented on the screen)
and our generous bonus meant that attrition occurred before the experimental
measures, at the screening phase.
EMPHASIS ON CULTURE NOT JUSTIFIED BY METHODS
variables. But they're all confounded and cultural variation wasn't the central focus of
the project. This just isn't well designed for testing any "cultural" hypotheses (see my
demographics concerns from the 1st round). Perhaps that this section of the results
could be condensed to a summary with the details provided in a supplement? This
will keep the focus on the null effect of the cue, which is the big news here, right?
Anywhere these cultural variables are analyzed, I urge that the relevant sample size
be included (e.g. Table 5) to make the limitations of generalizability more obvious.
We measure variables linked to self reported religion, ethnicity, language, and
cultural region. For completeness and in line with best practice for reporting scientific
findings, we report the association with all of the variables tested in our analysis. The
variables are somewhat confounded but not strictly dependent. They capture different
potential predicts and their correlation is one of the reasons we run and report the
multiple regression analysis, where we find that it is cultural region that is the clearest
predictor of donation levels, not religious or language affiliation. We think these
results are important and justify the space they are given in the manuscript (which is
less than 5% of the text). We already note in the text that the USA and India make up
the bulk of the sample. We now give the sample size of the culture groups in Table 5
and note in the text “Whilst none of the other cultural regions showed significant
differences, the sample sizes were small (<20) because the bulk of the MTurk
population is from U.S.A. and India.” (Lines 297-299). We now also note in the
discussion that the culture effect is generated by USA and Indian data. In the light of
the reviewer’s request to keep the discussion of these variables brief, we have not
included further frequencies in the main paper, but of course all of the data is in the
supplementary material.
REPUTATION CONCERN?
The authors measured public self-consciousness as a form of reputation concern.
There was no main effect on donation, so the authors do not look for an interaction
with condition (line 298). If (some) eyes induce concern for reputation, but some
don't, shouldn't the expectation be an interaction between reputation concern and
"reputation" condition?
Yes, this is expected if some images have an effect and if that effect is contingent on
public self consciousness. We find no effect of eyes and no evidence for an
interaction effect. We now note in the paper that none of the variables in Table 3
show an interaction effect (Line 326).

Reviewer’s comments
think that all claims made in an abstract require a very clear rationale and I still don't see how
"this work supports the importance of culture." Again, "culture" is defined in here as nation of
origin, and the "importance" of country of origin to the present results is not obvious and not
explained, beyond a US vs. India difference. I still don't really even know what "culture" means
n this context -- why not just say country of origin/residence? (In contrast, I do agree that "this
work supports the importance of ... enduring individual differences in prosocial behaviour"
- I understand what this claim means.)
Referring to ‘country of origin’ is also problematic here as we did not use country of origin
as a predictor – doing so would have overparameterized our model because there are
dozens of countries in our sample. Whilst ‘culture’ can mean many things, we do not think
he term is misleading in the abstract. We are very clear in our paper that we classified
nations according to Inglehart’s widely used cultural zones but that the sample is
predominantly from the US and India. We have nevertheless altered the wording in the
abstract to refer to the importance of ‘cultural differences’ rather than ‘culture’.
> -- The new introduction of the variation in eyes images is very helpful! For #2 (abstract vs
ealism), there have been a wider variety of abstract images previously used than is currently
mentioned.
We have reworded this section slightly and added references to other studies that used
abstract images.
And it isn't clear to me how #4 derives from the legacy hypothesis.
The greater the number of observers the greater the chance of a behaviour being observed
and reported to others. Thus humans should be more sensitive to reputational concerns
when viewed by more watchers. We now make this point in the text (line 97).
> -- The authors assert (line 442) that University participant pools participants are highly
experienced, but it is hard to imagine their relevant experience is anything close to MTurk
workers.
It is quite easy to imagine a scenario where a Mturker has participated in only a few hits
nvolving psychology research and a psychology student in a participant pool has
completed many experiments across the duration of their course, or as a paid participant.
Whether these two types of population vary significantly and consistently, as the reviewer
suggests, seems a question for future research.
> -- The authors may wish to see a recent meta-analysis of this literature -- Northover et al, in
press at Evolution and Human Behavior
We thank the reviewer for bringing this to attention and now cite it (Line 431).
