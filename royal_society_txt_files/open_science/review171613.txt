The paper, Diversity of Management Strategies in Mesoamerican Turkeys: Archaeological,
Isotopic and Genetic Evidence, by Manin et al. presents a nicely integrated study using aDNA
and stable isotope analysis of a sample (n=55) of turkeys from across ancient Mesoamerica. The
research is well-designed, and the results have important implications relevant to our
understanding of the process and locations of domestication of turkeys in the New World.
Moreover, the combination of genetic and isotopic data increases our understanding of how
turkeys were managed in different regions and in different times. Overall, the paper is well
written, and the data are important, and I therefore recommended it for publication with only
minor revisions.
My only substantive critique is the small sample size of the study and the broad conclusions that
are drawn from it. The goal of the project, which was to “examine how the process of turkey
domestication unfolded in Mesoamerica by assessing the origins and genetic diversity of
exploited (sub)species or lineages and the extent to which natural turkey feeding behaviours
were influenced by humans” is a very ambitious goal to achieve with 33 DNA-analyzed
specimens from across a large geographic and temporal range. However, archaeological
collections are never perfect, and the data are still a major advancement in our knowledge. I
recommend that the authors caveat their study and highlight the results and conclusions as
preliminary due to the sample size, particularly for specific claims, such as on page 17, line 51
“The presence of both kind of turkeys in similar contexts from Teotihuacan suggests the absence
of any systematic or intensive husbandry practices in the metropolis...” Making broad claims
about the subsistence strategies of a major multi-ethnic and class-stratified city with a market
economy from six specimens is premature, at least without greater emphasis on the preliminary
nature of the data.
MINOR COMMENTS:
Page 5, line 44. – should be “analysis” after “…human intervention in Mesoamerican through
biomolecular ***”.
Page 11, line 11 – switch the order of -20.5 and -6.6 to have the lower number appear first
Page 13, line 56 – missing “the” before Mesoamerican, and pluralize “turkey”
Page 14, line 33 – the authors write “This pattern of local exploitation contrasts with the SW
United States, where the most commonly exploited lineage of turkeys does not appear to be
derived from the local wild turkey subspecies …” List the genus and species of this most
commonly exploited animal here to make clear, particularly since you list the names of all other
varieties in preceding paragraphs.
Page 15, line 34 – do you mean southern Mexico as in the Yucatan? Perhaps central Mexico would
be better? Or maybe south-central?
Page 15, line 53 - “… however, and greater resolution in our knowledge of the timings of turkey
rearing…” * cut the “and”
Page 17, line 28 - change to “Maya region”
Page 19, line 51 – the White et al. 1989 paper is nearly 30 years old, perhaps better to include
3
reference to more recent analyses. See either Scherer (2017) for an overview that discusses diet, or
Somerville et al. (2017) for a meta-analysis.

Bottom of page 19/top of page 20 – The point here is unclear. Perhaps the d15N value of 1.8 listed
for the turkeys is a typo? Otherwise difficult to see why the authors would claim that the human
and turkey diets are similar? Table 2 indicates that Yucatan turkeys had a d15N of 6.83, which is
actually closer to a 3 per mil trophic difference between the human value of 9.5.

5
6 The turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) represents one of the few domestic animals of the New World.
7
8 While current research points to distinct domestication centers in the Southwest United States
9
10 and Mesoamerica, several questions regarding the number of progenitor populations, and the
11 timing and intensity of turkey husbandry remain unanswered. This study applied ancient
12
13 mitochondrial DNA and stable isotope (d13C, d15N) analysis to 55 archaeological turkey remains
14
15 from Mexico to investigate pre-contact turkey exploitation in Mesoamerica. Three different
16
17 (sub)species of turkeys were identified in the archaeological record (M. g. mexicana, M. g.
18
gallopavo, and M. ocellata), indicating the exploitation of diverse local populations, as well as
19
20 the trade of captively-reared birds into the Maya area. No evidence of shared maternal
21
22 haplotypes were observed between Mesoamerica and the Southwest United States, in contrast
23
24 with archaeological evidence for trade of other domestic products. Isotopic analysis indicates a
25
26
range of feeding behaviours in ancient Mesoamerican turkeys, including wild foraging, human
27 provisioning, and mixed feeding ecologies. This variability in turkey diet decreases through time,
28
29 with archaeological, genetic and isotopic evidence all pointing to the intensification of domestic
30
31 turkey management and husbandry, culminating in the Postclassic period.

4 1. Introduction
5
6 Few animals have been fully domesticated in the New World. Among them, the North
7
8 American wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) (hereafter referred to as the common turkey),
9
10 represented an important resource in both Mesoamerica and the Southwest (SW) United States.
11 Evidence of turkey bones and feathers recovered from multiple archaeological sites and contexts
12
13 indicate that these birds played a significant role as food, raw material sources for bone tools and
14
15 feather artifacts, as well as for medicinal and ritual purposes [e.g. 1,2–5]. Despite a growing
16
17 body of literature concerning turkey exploitation in both regions [6–8], debates persist as to
18
geographic origin of domestic turkeys in North America, the number of times the domestication
19
20 process may have been initiated, and how this process unfolded in both regions [9].
21
22
23
In the SW United States, ancient turkey husbandry began around 200-500 CE [4,10] and
24 has been studied using a variety of analytical approaches, in particular osteological analyses
25
26 [e.g., 11,12–14], stable isotopes [7,15–18], genetics [7,19,20], morphometrics [21],
27
28 palaeopathologies [22], coprolites [23] and eggshell characterisation [15,24]. Stable isotopes,
29
30 pathological features and pollen found in coprolites indicate that turkeys were usually not ‘free-
31 range’, but often enclosed in pens or corrals, and provisioned with human staples, mostly maize.
32
33 Whereas different domestic breeds have been claimed on the basis of osteological features and
34
35 bone size [12], a strong sexual dimorphism, with smaller females than males, would explain
36
37 most of the observed morphological variation [21]. Ancient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
38
39
analyses indicate that one maternal lineage predominates within the archaeological domestic
40 turkeys of the Southwest, distinct from that of the local Merriam’s wild turkey (M. g. merriami)
41
42 [19]. Although the geographic origin of the Southwest domestic lineage is still unclear, the
43
44 predominance of a single maternal lineage indicates long-term continuity in turkey husbandry for
45
46 over a millennium in this region.

31 In contrast to the American Southwest, historically far less research has been dedicated to
32
33 uncovering the origins and timing of Mesoamerican turkey domestication, with
34
35 bioarchaeological and morphometric approaches being applied relatively recently [25–30].
36
37 Within Mesoamerica, several questions concerning the domestication process remain
38
39
unanswered, including the overall chronology of human intervention as well as the number of
40 wild progenitor populations contributing to domestic stocks [9]. A recent synthesis of the
41
42 Preclassic turkey remains (i.e., dating before 180 CE) suggests that common turkeys were
43
44 already being captively reared during this period - albeit at a small scale - in different locations
45
46 throughout Mesoamerica, including areas outside of their natural range [9]. The earliest
47 confirmed evidence of captively-reared common turkeys has been found in the Yucatan, at the
48
49 site of El Mirador, Guatemala, dating from 327 BCE - 54 CE. Most recently ancient DNA
50
51 (aDNA) and isotope analysis (C, N, 87Sr/86Sr) has been used to identify specimens of common
52
53 turkey, raised locally and provisioned with high quantities of C4 plants, probably maize [29,30].

Other Preclassic evidence, such as a complete turkey skeleton discovered in a sepulture in
55

Monte Alban, Oaxaca [32] demonstrates the symbolic importance of this bird even in these early
4

8
Several different regions have been proposed for the origin of domestication, including
9 western highlands of Michoacán [33], or the Mixteca of Oaxaca [34] but these assumptions lack
10
11 archaeological support. The wild progenitor subspecies also remains to be confirmed: while
12
13 modern genetic analyses suggest that domestic turkeys were derived from the South Mexican
14
15 wild turkey (M. g. gallopavo) [35], Mexico is home to two other wild populations, the Rio
16 Grande wild turkey (M. g. intermedia) and the Gould's wild turkey (M. g. mexicana), ranging
17
18 within the Sierra Madre Occidental and Oriental, respectively (Figure 1). It is unknown to what
19
20 extent these populations may have been influenced by human intervention, or to what degree
21
22 they may have contributed genetically to domestic stocks. In addition to the common turkey (M.
23
24
gallopavo), the brightly plumed ocellated turkey (M. ocellata) is found within Mexico’s Yucatan
25 peninsula, and parts of northern Belize and Guatemala (Figure 1). While ocellated turkeys are
26
27 not currently raised as domestic birds in the Yucatan, their potential captive rearing has long
28
29 been discussed among zooarchaeologists and ornithologists, although this practice has not been
30
31 conclusively demonstrated in the archaeological record [30]. Finally, previous aDNA research
32 suggested that the domestic turkey of the SW United States was genetically distinct from the
33
34 Mesoamerican lineage [19] with no evidence for trade of domestic turkey between the two
35
36 regions. No genetic data, however, has been obtained from ancient Mesoamerican turkey to
37
38 explicitly test this hypothesis.
39
40 Our study aimed to elucidate the geographic origins and wild progenitors of
41
42 Mesoamerican turkeys, and document the nature, intensity and chronology of human
43
44
intervention in Mesoamerican through biomolecular of archaeological turkey remains. Here, we
45 applied ancient mtDNA analyses to 55 archaeological turkey remains to explore both
46
47 phylogeographic patterning and the level of human intervention in turkey reproduction and
48
49 breeding. We also applied stable isotope (d13C, d15N) analysis of bone collagen to explore human
50
51 provisioning and restrictions on turkey diets. We compared these biomolecular data to
52 archaeological evidence of distribution and abundance of turkey remains through time and space
53
54 to investigate the geographic origins, timing and intensity of Mesoamerican turkey
55
56 domestication.

9
10 The archaeological turkey samples analysed in this study were obtained from the Instituto
11
12 Nacional de Antropología e Historia, Mexico City (INAH), the Facultad de Ciencias
13
Antropológicas, Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán (UADY), the Instituto de Investigaciones
14
15 Antropológicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), the Centro de Estudios
16
17 Mexicanos y Centroamericanos (CEMCA) and the University of Calgary (UofC). A total of 55
18
19 turkey bones from 14 different archaeological sites in Northern Mexico, Central Mexican
20
21
Highlands, Western Mexico, the Gulf Coast and Yucatan were analysed, including seven
22 archaeological specimens previously analysed using aDNA by Speller et al. [19]. Supplementary
23
24 Table S1 lists the provenance and element information for the samples, and the site locations are
25
26 depicted in Figure 1. Prior to biomolecular analysis, samples were photographed and measured
27
28 according to criteria outlined in von den Driesch [36]. Of these 55 bones, 53 bones had sufficient
29 material for both isotopic and genetic analyses.
30
31
32
33 2.2 Radiocarbon Dating
34
35
36
Five samples were sent for radiocarbon dating at the Center for Applied Isotope Studies
37 at the University of Georgia to validate the chronology. Sample preparation methods and main
38
39 results are outlined in SI Material 1, and the results presented in Table S2.
40
41
42 2.3 Isotope Analysis
43
44
45 Fifty-three bones were prepared for isotopic analyses at the Department of Anthropology,
46
47 University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada) and at BioArCh, Department of
48
49 Archaeology, University of York, (York, UK). Collagen was extracted following the procedure
50
51
outlined in SI Material 1. The results are expressed in per mil (‰) in reference (d) with
52 established standards (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite - VPDB - for d13C and atmospheric air - AIR -
53
54 for d15N). All samples produced acceptable C:N ratios (between 2.9 and 3.6, [37]) %C and %N
55
56 values [38], and the errors on the d13C and d15N measurements are less than 0.2 ‰ (Table S1).

As the ultrafiltration step can significantly reduce the amount of collagen retrieved [39], the
4
5 threshold of 1 % collagen yield has not been used, although yields are reported.
6

8
Statistical analyses of the isotopic data were conducted using PAleontological STatistics
9 software (PAST, v.3.08; [40], with p values < 0.05 considered significant. Initial assessment of
10
11 the data through the use of a Shapiro-Wilk test rejected the hypothesis of normal distribution for
12
13 both d13C (W = 0.8, p < 0.001) and d15N (W = 0.9, p = 0.03) and only non-parametric tests were
14
15 applied to identify differences between groups. Overall variability between more than two
16 groups was assessed by Kruskal-Wallis tests. Mann-Whitney tests for equal median were used to
17
18 compare groups, integrating a Bonferroni correction when more than two groups were involved.
19
20 For each group, mean and standard deviations have been calculated and the values are expressed
21
22 with a precision of ± 1 sd. As isotopic data can be considered to be continuous values,
23
24
correlation between d13C and d15N was calculated using the Pearson method.

26
27 2.4 Ancient DNA Analysis
28
29
30 Of the 55 turkey bones included in the study, seven had been previously analysed in
31 Speller et al. [19]; the remaining 48 samples of archaeological turkey bones were analysed in
32
33 three ancient DNA laboratories (Table S1), located in the Department of Archaeology, Simon
34
35 Fraser University (SFU), the Department of Anthropology and Archaeology, University of
36
37 Calgary (UofC), and BioArCh, University of York (UofY). In all three laboratories, sample
38
preparation and DNA extraction followed the silica spin-column protocol [41] modified as
39
40 described in Speller et al. [19] (see SI Material 1 for detailed methods). Overlapping sequences
41
42 were concatenated and truncated to 438 bp (position 15567-16004, based on complete mtDNA
43
44 genome of GenBank specimen NC010195) to remove primer sequences, and make them
45
46 comparable to reference sequences found in Mock et al. [42] and Speller et al. [19]. The obtained
47 D-loop haplotypes (submitted to Genbank under Accessions: MF947187-MF947219) were
48
49 compared with 298 Meleagris GenBank entries, including modern commercial breeds [35] and
50
51 North American wild turkeys [42,43] as well as the 12 ancient haplotypes identified in the
52
53 archaeological turkey remains recovered from the American Southwest [19] using ClustalW [44]
54
through BioEdit [45] and Network (v. 5.0) [46].

5
6
7 3.1 Species Identification and Phylogenetic Analysis
8
9
10 We recovered mitochondrial DNA from 33 of the 48 bones, an overall success rate of
11
12 69% (Table 1). Twenty samples yielded the entire 438 bp fragment, while an additional 13
13
samples yielded partial mtDNA profiles, sufficient for species identification, and in some cases
14
15 for haplotype identification (Table S1). The majority of the turkey bones (n=31) were identified
16
17 as M. gallopavo and two as M. ocellata. Both M. ocellata samples were recovered from the site
18
19 of Calakmul, Yucatan, within the natural range of the ocellated turkey. The 31 M. gallopavo
20
21
samples were more widely distributed, with 29 individuals recovered from archaeological sites
22 within the natural distribution of the common turkey, and four individuals identified at the
23
24 Postclassic Yucatan site of Champotón. Four different M. gallopavo haplotypes were identified
25
26 in the remains: 14 turkeys were identified as mHap1; 12 as mHap2; 1 as mHap2a and 2 as
27
28 mHap2b.
29
30 The two most common haplotypes identified in the archaeological remains, mHap1 and
31
32 mHap2 (as described in Speller et al. [19]) have been previously observed in modern domestic
33
turkeys, Rio Grande wild turkeys (M. g. intermedia) and the historic specimens of South
34
35 Mexican wild turkey (M. g. gallopavo); haplotypes mHap2a and mHap2b (differing from mHap2
36
37 by one base pair, respectively), have not been previously reported in modern domestic or wild
38
39 turkey. Archaeological sites within Central Mexico displayed the greatest diversity with the
40
41
presence of all four haplotypes. Haplotypes mHap1 and mHap2 were observed in archaeological
42 specimens from Yucatan (n=1, respectively), while Western Mexican turkeys were only
43
44 identified as mHap1 (n=5), and Gulf Coast turkey were identified only as mHap2 (n=3) or
45
46 mHap2b (n=1).
47
48 When phylogenetically compared with other wild and domestic turkey haplotypes, the
49
50 Mesoamerican archaeological turkey samples fall into clade H3 (as described in Speller et al.
51
52 [19]) including modern European domestic turkey breeds [35], North American commercially
53
raised birds, as well as the limited sequences available from historic specimens of the South
54
55 Mexican domestic turkey (M. g. gallopavo), the local wild turkey of South Central Mexico
56
57 (Figure 2). None of the samples we extracted in this study had haplotypes observed in Gould’s

wild turkey (M. g. mexicana), although this subspecies was previously detected in the
4
5 archaeological samples analysed from the Calderón site in Northern Mexico [19], which we
6
7 analysed using isotopic analysis. Likewise, we did not detect the dominant haplotype observed
8

turkey bones.

52 3.2 Stable isotopes analyses
53
54 Our data indicate a range of feeding behaviours were undertaken by turkeys, including
55
56 diets demonstrating a reliance on C3 plants (d13C of ~ -22 to -19 ‰), diets dominated by C4 plants

(d13C ~ -10 to -6 ‰) and a mixed feeding ecology (d13C ~ -18 to -11 ‰) [47,48](Table 2). Table
4
5 2 presents a summary of the results of isotope ratios; individual values, well as collagen quality
6
7 and yields are described in Table S1. Collagen yields ranged from 0.2 % to 11.6 % per sample,
8
9 with elemental carbon ranging from 37.6 % to 44.2 % and elemental nitrogen ranging from 13.5
10
11
% to 16.0 %. Overall, d13C values range between -6.6 and -20.5 ‰ (mean d13C = -11.8 ± 4.60 ‰,
12 1s), and d15N values ranged between 3.5 and 9.8 ‰ (mean d15N = 7.3 ± 1.65 ‰, 1s). There is a
13
14 positive correlation between carbon and nitrogen ratios (Pearson’s r = 0.71, p<0.001) indicating
15
16 that individuals with higher d13C values tend to have corresponding higher d15N values.

40 We observed differences in feeding strategies between regions, time periods and turkey
41
42 species (Figure 3a). Within the Maya area (encompassing Yucatan and Northern Central
43
America), turkeys fell within two distinct d13C groups, according to their chronology (U=0, z=-
44
45 2.80, p=0.005). Turkeys from the Classic period sites of Calakmul and Chichén Itzá displayed
46
13
47 C-depleted values of -19.2 to -20.5‰ (n=6, mean d13C = -20.0 ± 0.48 ‰); DNA identified
48
49 specimens at these sites as M. ocellata. In contrast, turkeys from the Postclassic site of
50
51
Champotón displayed 13C-enriched values of -7.8 to -9.1‰ (n=6, mean d13C = -8.3 ± 0.67 ‰),
52 indicating diets reliant primarily on C4 plants; DNA identified turkeys from this site as M.
53
54 gallopavo. We also observe significant increase in d15N in the Classic compared to the
55
56 Postclassic groups (U=1, z=-2.64, p=0.008). Together, these results support different feeding

behaviour in the two turkey species present in the Maya region, consistent with Thornton et al.’s
4
5 [30] recently published isotopic study.
6
7
8
In Central Mexico, the only sample that can be accurately attributed to a Preclassic
9 context (TU206) displays intermediate d13C consistent with a mixed feeding ecology. Turkeys
10
11 from the Classic metropolis of Teotihuacan (n=6) display highly variable isotopic values that
12
13 seem to cluster in two different groups. Group 1 turkeys (n=3, mean d13C = -18.4 ± 0.41 ‰;
14
15 mean d15N = 3.6 ± 0.13 ‰) are particularly low in both d13C and d15N and represent birds with a
16 predominantly C3 diet. Group 2 turkeys (n=3, mean d13C = -11.1 ± 0.91 ‰; mean d15N = 7.2 ±
17
18 0.86 ‰) display higher d13C and d15N values and cluster with other Classic - Late Classic birds
19
20 from the same region (n=8, mean d13C = -10.9 ± 1.45 ‰; mean d15N = 7.2 ± 0.49 ‰) from which
21
22 they do not differ statistically (U=5, z=-0.65, p>0.05). The six samples from Teotihuacan have
23
24
been attributed to three different haplotypes, mHap1 (n=2) and mHap2/mHap2a (n=4), but there
25 are no differences in the carbon (U=4, z=-0.23, p>0.05) or nitrogen values (U=2, z=-0.69,
26
27 p>0.05) that would suggest a direct relation between the genetic lineage and feeding habits.
28
29 Postclassic turkeys from Western Mexico and the Gulf Coast display very high d13C
30
31 values ranging from -10.7 to -7.8 ‰ (mean d13C = -9.1 ± 1.22 ‰) and from -8.5 to -6.6‰ (mean
32
33 d13C = -7.8 ± 0.85 ‰) respectively, and do not differ statistically (U=4, z=-1.35, p>0.05).
34
35 We applied stable isotope analysis to nine samples from Chihuahua, Northern Mexico
36
37 (outside of the Mesoamerican culture area), that were previously tested for aDNA [19]. The
38
39 seven samples with reliable collagen extraction display a broad variation in d13C values (from -
40
41
17.2 to -6.8‰, mean d13C = -10.0 ± 3.94 ‰), suggesting mixed feeding ecologies as well as diets
42 composed almost exclusively of C4 plants. Only two turkey bones from the Calderón site yielded
43
44 mtDNA haplotypes [19], both of which matched the dominant haplotype observed in the local
45
46 Gould’s wild turkey (M. g. mexicana). While isotope values could only be obtained from one of
47
48 the two DNA identified samples (TU152), it displayed the most enriched d13C at the site,
49 indicating that at least some local turkeys had access to large quantities of maize or other C4
50
51 plants (Figure 3c).

43 4. Discussion
44
45
46 In this study, we sought to examine how the process of turkey domestication unfolded in
47
Mesoamerica by assessing the origins and genetic diversity of exploited (sub)species or lineages
48
49 and the extent to which natural turkey feeding behaviours were influenced by humans. Our
50
51 results indicated that multiple populations of turkeys were exploited in pre-contact Mesoamerica
52
53 with feeding behaviours that ranged from predominantly (wild) C3 plants to those heavily
54
55
enriched with (cultivated) C4 plants. Comparing these results with similar published data from
56 Mesoamerica and SW United States, as well as the presence of turkey in Mesoamerican

3
archaeological record, we discuss their implications in terms of understanding the nature of
4
5 exploited populations, the locations of domestication centres, and the varying intensity of
6
7 human-turkey relationships within pre-contact Mesoamerica.
8
9
10 4.1 Exploitation of local populations
11
12
13 Our mtDNA results indicate that at least five populations of turkeys were exploited in
14
15 North America, with a strong geographic component. In the Central Mexican Highlands,
16
17 Western Mexico and Gulf Coast, archaeological turkeys displayed mitochondrial lineages
18
identical or closely related to the local South Mexican wild turkey, M. g. gallopavo (and Rio
19
20 Grande wild turkey M. g. intermedia). In Yucatan, the genetic data from this and previous
21
22 studies [29,30] confirm that both the local ocellated turkeys (M. ocellata) and ‘exotic’ common
23
24 turkeys (M. gallopavo) were exploited, with the local species representing only around one-third
25
26
of the tested assemblage. In Northern Mexico, an intermediate region between the nuclear
27 Puebloan area and Mesoamerica, we observe the exploitation of a third local population,
28
29 represented by the Gould’s wild turkey (M. g. mexicana).
30
31 This pattern of local exploitation contrasts with the SW United States, where the most
32
33 commonly exploited lineage of turkeys does not appear to be derived from the local wild turkey
34
35 subspecies (M. g. merriami), but instead appears to have been introduced into the region. In the
36
37 four-corners region, ‘local/wild’ birds represent a relatively minor component of exploited turkey
38
stocks, making up approximately 15% of tested assemblages even in regions which were thought
39
40 to support relatively large stocks of wild turkeys [6,19].
41
42
43
44 4.2 North American Domestication Centres
45
46 Our observation of ancient M.g. gallopavo haplotypes in Mesoamerican turkey remains is
47
48 consistent with the historical understanding of Central Mexico as the domestication centre, with
49
50 the South Mexican wild turkey (M. g. gallopavo) as the progenitor subspecies [5,19,49]. The two
51
52 predominant ancient Mesoamerican haplotypes, mHap1 and mHap2, are also found in Rio
53
Grande wild turkey populations, making this subspecies another potential progenitor for
54
55 Mesoamerican lineages. Pinpointing the specific geographic origin(s) of the Mesoamerican
56
57 domestic turkeys is confounded by a scarcity of paleontological records [9,50] and a lack of
58

3
modern genetic reference data for Rio Grande populations in Eastern Mexico and for the
4
5 (presumably extinct) South Mexican wild turkeys in Central Mexico. Archaeological evidence
6
7 suggest that some of the earliest turkey exploitation in Preclassic periods occurred within the
8
9 Gulf of Mexico area [51], although these sites are located south of the presumed natural
10
11
distribution of the wild turkey. Some sites from the central valleys of Oaxaca also display
12 significant numbers of turkey bones from the Preclassic period onwards [52–54]. Genetic and
13
14 isotopic analyses of turkey bones from these and other early sites may be key to deciphering the
15
16 origins of domestication in the region.
17
18 When assessed within a broader continental context, the ancient Mesoamerican
19
20 mitochondrial lineages we recovered in this study demonstrate a clear distinction from the
21
22 indigenous lineage of domestic turkey raised by the Ancestral Puebloan of the SW United States,
23
24
confirming that the two geographic centres were exploiting separate populations of domestic
25 turkeys. These results support the presence of two turkey domestication centres in pre-contact
26
27 North America, one involving M. g. gallopavo (and/or M. g. intermedia) in south-central Mexico
28
29 and the second (progenitor population as yet unknown) resulting in the domestic breed of the
30
31 American Southwest. Furthermore, the close relationship between Mexico’s archaeological
32 turkeys and modern turkeys [35] reinforces our historical understanding that modern European
33
34 breeds ultimately originate from southern Mexico rather than elsewhere in North America
35
36 [49,55]. Lying between these two regions, within Northern Mexico, we see evidence of the
37
38 exploitation (and likely captive rearing) of a third population, M. g. mexicana [19].
39
40 The apparent absence of turkey trading between Mesoamerica and the SW United States
41
42 (at least as demonstrated by mtDNA data), would suggest that turkey domestication occurred as
43
44
biologically independent events [56], even if the initial domestication centres and specific
45 progenitor populations are not yet accurately identified. The use of distinct turkey populations
46
47 thus contrasts with numerous examples of trade and exchanges of managed resources between
48
49 the two regions, including a variety of domestic crops [e.g. 57,58] and living scarlet macaws
50
51 [3,59–61]. The extent to which concepts and practices of captive turkey rearing (if not the live
52 birds themselves) were exchanged between two regions remains to be explored, however, and
53
54 greater resolution in our knowledge of the timings of turkey rearing in both regions may suggest
55
56 the direction of potential diffusion.

4.3 Timing and Intensity of Human Intervention
4
5
6 We assessed the nature and intensity of human intervention within Mesoamerican turkey
7
8 populations in terms of their reproduction and management through both the genetic and isotopic
9
10 evidence. The Mexican archaeological turkey samples demonstrate relatively little mitochondrial
11
12 diversity, with four haplotypes present in the ancient remains. Some archaeological sites (notably
13 the Postclassic sites of Malpais Prieto in Western Mexico, and Huixtoco in Central Mexico)
14
15 display the presence of only a single haplotype, respectively (mHap1). This genetic uniformity
16
17 may be indicative of a genetic bottleneck, the reduction in genetic diversity often associated with
18
19 the limited breeding group of domestic stocks [62], and thus evidence that these bones would
20
represent managed birds, rather than local wild turkeys. This mitochondrial homogeneity is akin
21
22 to that observed within the domestic populations of the SW United States, where many sites have
23
24 abundant turkey bones, and strong archaeological evidence for penning and on-site breeding
25
26 [4,18,e.g. 63]. However, there is a lack of comparative mtDNA data from Mexican wild turkey
27
28
populations, making it difficult to assess the range of genetic variation that may have been
29 present in founding or local wild populations. Additional nuclear genetic analyses of modern and
30
31 historic Mexican wild turkey samples, along with analysis of modern indigenous Mexican turkey
32
33 breeds may help to clarify the range of mtDNA variation present in wild and domestic remains,
34
35 and restrictions in genetic diversity and selective sweeps that might have accompanied the
36 domestication process [64].
37
38
39 In contrast to the genetic data, stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen can provide
40
41
greater resolution in measuring the degree of animal management in ancient North America.
42 Several studies have indicated that captive animals under human control displayed higher values
43
44 of d13C due to reliance on domestic C4 crops such as maize, as well as an increase in d15N values
45
46 that could be related with the consumption of manured crops and human food scraps or as an
47
48 effect of confinement. Similar isotopic shifts between wild and managed animals in North and
49 Central America has been observed in turkeys [7,16,30], leporids [65,66], deer [67], wolves,
50
51 cougar and golden eagle [68]. In the case of common turkeys, previous isotopic data suggest a
52
53 strong reliance on maize in both the SW United States and the Maya area [7,15,17,18,30]. Only
54
55 in more marginal areas of the American Southwest, where maize was not readily available, they
56
seem to rely on a mixed C3/C4 diet, suggesting ‘free-range’ husbandry practices [16]. Here, we

consider the chronology and intensity of turkey management as evidenced by the stable isotope
4
5 analysis.
6

8
4.3.1 Preclassic and Classic Turkey husbandry
9
10 The isotopic results from this and other studies reinforce the variability in turkey
11
12 husbandry practices throughout Mesoamerica during the Preclassic and Classic periods. The
13 earliest evidence of maize provisioning occurs during the Preclassic is that revealed by analysis
14
15 of the Maya turkeys at El Mirador [30] (El Mirador, n=3, mean d13C = -11.8 2.5 ‰). In
16
17 contrast, the turkey we analysed from Oaxtepec, Morelos, associated with a Preclassic grave,
18
19 displays a more mixed diet (d13C = -15.5 ‰) very similar to the turkeys from the marginal region
20
21 of Gallinas in the American Southwest [16], potentially representing a more free-ranging animal,
22
or a wild bird with access to significant quantities of maize. Together, these data indicate that
23
24 different degrees of turkey management were emerging in Mesoamerica before the start of the
25
26 common era, with perhaps greater human intervention occurring in non-local bird populations,
27
28 such as those in the Mayan area.
29
30 In the Classic metropolis of Teotihuacan, the six samples analysed here and two samples
31
32 previously analysed from the Teopancazco district [69] show differential access to C4 plants and
33
34 different levels of enrichment in 15N (Figure 4). Although our sample size is small, the three
35 individuals with the lowest values of d13C show no statistical differences from modern North
36
37 America wild turkeys from [7,16,48] or archaeological free-range raised turkeys [16] (Kruskal-
38
39 Wallis <U+03C7>2 = 1.626, p>0.05), indicating a similar access to wild plants. These turkeys also display
40
41 extremely low d15N values, although there is no significant difference from other Classic and
42
43
Late Classic remains in the region. Conversely, the other turkeys from Teotihuacan display
44 enriched isotopic values closer to other analysed common turkeys within Mesoamerica. These
45
46 data suggest turkeys were subject to at least two different management practices in Teotihuacan:
47
48 half of the birds seem to represent wild turkeys or free-range raised birds, while the others
49
50 display evidence of a more constrained diet based on mid-to-high quantities of C4 plants,
51 certainly provisioned by humans. The presence of both kind of turkeys in similar contexts from
52
53 Teotihuacan suggests the absence of any systematic or intensive husbandry practices in the
54
55 metropolis, an observation reinforced by the turkey’s secondary rank in importance in terms of
56
57 human subsistence (as suggested by zooarchaeological data) [70]. In the Maya area, joint genetic

and isotopic results arising from this study suggest that only wild ocellated turkeys were

5 exploited during the Classic, which is consistent with data from earlier work [30].

31
32 4.3.2 Postclassic intensification
33
34 During the Postclassic, we observe significantly higher values of both d13C (U=26.5, z=-
35
36 4.61, p<0,001) and d15N (U=102, z=-2.71, p=0.007) (Figure 3b, Figure 5a) suggesting an
37
38
intensification of management or otherwise increased access of wild birds to human crops. This
39 Postclassic increase in d13C demonstrates that turkey diet shifted further away from a wild diet,
40
41 and that turkey were relying ever more heavily on provisioned maize or other C4 plants, similar
42
43 to the pattern observed in the SW United States (Figure 3c) [7,17,18]. d15N values may be
44
45 influenced by a wide range of ecological factors such as the trophic level (as omnivores, turkeys
46 eat a range of protein sources including insects that tend to possess higher d15N values) and
47
48 nutritional stress [71–73]. Other factors depend on the environment, including aridity [74,75],
49
50 soil salinity [76] or crop manuring [77,78]. While the Postclassic turkeys we analysed here
51
52 originate from a large variety of environments, from the tropical Maya lowlands to the arid
53
54
Mexican highlands, their d15N values show limited variation (n = 30, mean d15N =7.7 ± 1.00 ‰),
55 suggesting that natural parameters such as climate or edaphic substrate had less impact on
56
57 nitrogen variations than did the enrichment of soils and crops by human activities (whether the
58
59
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 19 of 30 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3
birds were feeding in fertilized human fields, on high nitrogen crops such as beans, or were
4
5 ingesting crops or prey with nitrogen values inflated by turkey manure) [79,80].
6
7
8
Our isotopic evidence for increased human intervention, provisioning and confinement
9 corresponds with zooarchaeological evidence from the Early Classic to the Postclassic (Figure
10
11 5b). While turkey bones are rare during the Preclassic [9] they increase in relative abundance
12
13 during the Classic, making up to ca. 40% of the bone remains in Monte Alban [54], although
14
15 they are still identified in relatively few archaeological sites (Table S3). As mentioned above
16 (4.3.1), the common turkeys are conspicuously absent in the Classic Maya sites at this early date.
17
18 By the Middle/Late Postclassic (i.e. from 1250 to 1521 CE), the number of turkey bones in
19
20 archaeological sites overtakes those of leporids, dogs or white-tailed deer (Figure 5b). Turkeys
21
22 reappear in the Maya area [30,81], and reach more than 90 % in some deposits such as a
23
24
domestic midden from Texcoco, Central Mexico [82]. However, the motivations behind this
25 intensification in turkey husbandry, particularly in the Middle to Late Postclassic, are not
26
27 completely clear. Demographic pressure with increased urbanism at Mesoamerican sites does not
28
29 seem to be the main motivation for intensification in turkey use, as limited turkey breeding is
30
31 observed within the metropolis of Teotihuacan, or Classic Maya sites during their florescences
32 [9,30,70].
33
34
35 In the SW United States, the intensification of turkey husbandry has often been explained
36 as a response to a resource depletion [63,83] and this hypothesis can be considered in
37
38 Mesoamerica as well. While the reasons for the collapse of some of the large Maya centres at the
39
40 end of the Classic period (ca. 1000 CE) are still debated, environmental changes and droughts
41
42 have been proposed as factors that may have disrupted the availability of local resources required
43
44
to support densely populated urban centres [e.g. 84], [but see 85 for a discussion]. Stable
45 isotopes of carbon and nitrogen from human Maya populations indicate homogenous levels of
46
47 d15N across time, with an increase in d13C during the Postclassic - isotopic signatures that have
48
49 been interpreted as a proportionate reduction in access to meat alongside a dramatic increase in
50
51 maize consumption at the end of the chronology [86].
52
53 A shift from wild C3-fed to domestic C4-fed animals may also account for the rise in
54
55 human d13C ratios. The levels of d15N in Postclassic Maya populations (n=24, mean d15N = 9.5 ±
56
0.9 ‰; data from [86]) are only slightly higher than the Postclassic turkeys mean ratio (d15N =
57
58
59
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 20 of 30

2
3
1.8) and do not seem to reflect the 3-5 ‰ spacing expected if turkeys were the main source of
4
5 protein [87]. The isotopic similarity between Postclassic turkeys and Postclassic human
6
7 populations suggest similar diets, probably based on high amounts of C4-plant proteins, and may
8
9 alternatively indicate that turkeys were fed with human food scraps, secondarily increasing
10
11
human d13C ratios.
12
13 Another compelling argument for the intensification of turkey husbandry in the
14
15 Postclassic period, and indeed the management of turkeys in early periods in Mesoamerica,
16 relates to the symbolic and political importance of both wild and domestic turkeys throughout the
17
18 history of Mesoamerica. This role is emphasized by finds such as: the earliest Maya turkeys, all
19
20 found in ritual caches in elite temples [29]; the more recent finding that all Classic Maya M.
21
22 gallopavo are also associated with elite and ritual deposits [30]; a Postclassic palace midden at
23
24
the site of Texcoco containing almost exclusively turkey bones [82]; and the high frequency of
25 turkey bones in Postclassic funerary deposits at the site of Vista Hermosa (Gulf Coast) and their
26
27 virtual absence in domestic refuses [88]. Early Spanish observers also mention the use of
28
29 domestic birds (probably turkeys) to feed captive large carnivores and prey birds [89,90]. In the
30
31 Aztec capital, ceremonies, feasts and captive carnivore provisioning would have required
32 thousands of turkeys that were sent as tribute [5]. Thornton and Emery [9] also note the
33
34 importance of increased long-distance trade routes between Central Mexico and the Maya area,
35
36 as well as expanding trade routes between Mesoamerica, the Gulf Coast of Mexico, and the
37
38 Caribbean during the Postclassic, all of which may have increased demand and diffusion of
39
turkeys. Thus, unlike the American Southwest, Mesoamerican intensification in turkey
40
41 husbandry may be less strongly linked to demographic and environmental factors, and may
42
43 instead have been driven by a strong demand related to the emergence of new policies, and trade
44
45 routes, with the use of domestic birds for various uses including human and carnivore
46
47
consumption, ritual and sacrifices.

37 5. Conclusion
38
39 The intersection of archaeological, DNA and isotopic evidence can provide
40
41 unprecedented detail for documenting the nature, intensity and chronology of human intervention
42
43 in the evolution of animal species. Our multi-proxy study confirms that multiple (sub)species of
44
45 local turkeys were exploited in North America, with genetically distinct domestic lineages raised
46 in the American Southwest and in Mesoamerica. Our Preclassic specimen displayed an
47
48 intermediate dietary signature, supporting the finding of Thornton et al. [29,30] that turkeys were
49
50 captively reared and provisioned with maize throughout Mesoamerica since the Preclassic
51
52 period. The increasing frequency of turkey bones in the archaeological record, coupled with
53
54
evidence of enrichment in carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios in this study, testifies to the
55 intensification of turkey rearing during the Postclassic. In contrast to the American Southwest,
56
57 our data do not conclusively link the intensification of turkey husbandry to demographic or
58
59
60

environmental pressures. Further investigations are necessary to understand the regional trends
4
5 of turkey husbandry in relation to cultural development. The mitochondrial genetic data
6
7 recovered in this study is consistent other researchers’ findings that Mesoamerican birds were the
8
9 sole progenitors of modern turkey breeds, although whole genome analyses of heritage turkey
10
11
breeds and archaeological turkeys may provide further insight analysis into the timing and
12 intensity of selection for desirable traits such as plumage colour, overall size and growth rate

paper, Diversity of Management Strategies in Mesoamerican Turkeys: Archaeological, Isotopic and
etic Evidence, by Manin et al. presents a nicely integrated study using aDNA and stable isotope analysis of
mple (n=55) of turkeys from across ancient Mesoamerica. The research is well-designed, and the results
e important implications relevant to our understanding of the process and locations of domestication of
eys in the New World. Moreover, the combination of genetic and isotopic data increases our understanding
ow turkeys were managed in different regions and in different times. Overall, the paper is well written, and
data are important, and I therefore recommended it for publication with only minor revisions.
only substantive critique is the small sample size of the study and the broad conclusions that are drawn
it. The goal of the project, which was to “examine how the process of turkey domestication unfolded in
oamerica by assessing the origins and genetic diversity of exploited (sub)species or lineages and the
nt to which natural turkey feeding behaviours were influenced by humans” is a very ambitious goal to
eve with 33 DNA-analyzed specimens from across a large geographic and temporal range. However,
aeological collections are never perfect, and the data are still a major advancement in our knowledge. I
mmend that the authors caveat their study and highlight the results and conclusions as preliminary due to
sample size, particularly for specific claims, such as on page 17, line 51 “The presence of both kind of
eys in similar contexts from Teotihuacan suggests the absence of any systematic or intensive husbandry
tices in the metropolis...” Making broad claims about the subsistence strategies of a major multi-ethnic and
s-stratified city with a market economy from six specimens is premature, at least without greater emphasis
he preliminary nature of the data.
are thankful for these thoughtful comments. We agree that the sample size is small, but as noted by the
ewer, our study represents the first genetic data obtained from ancient Mesoamerican turkeys. We have
ed sentences within the discussion of the Teotihuacan findings (pg 17) and the conclusion, to reflect that
e are initial results: “These data suggest turkeys were subject to varying degrees of management practices
eotihuacan. [...] Nonetheless, a larger sample size would be necessary to refine these initial findings ” and
ther investigations on extended collections are necessary, however, to more fully understand the
onal trends of turkey husbandry in relation to cultural development”.
