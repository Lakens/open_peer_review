In this paper, Hussain Ismail and colleagues measure tilt aftereffects (TAEs) produced by
adaptation to images of houses tilted by ±15 deg. They find significant repulsive TAEs, even
when different houses are used during adapt and test phases, when adapt/test images are
filtered to minimise overlap in spatial frequency or orientation content and (albeit to a lesser
extent) when the adapting house image is phase scrambled. These results are interpreted as
evidence for gain control in mechanisms selective to the global orientation of a scene.
This is a clearly written paper, reporting a collection of carefully conducted and well analysed
experiments. The results are interesting and although a mechanism is currently lacking, the
findings should offer food for thought for others working in the field. I have no major objections,
but would like to see a few things clarified prior to publication.
In several places in the paper it is stated that adaptation to phase-scrambled houses did not
produce a repulsive TAE (e.g. lines 28-29; 290-291). While the effect was relatively small in this
condition, it did reach statistical significance at the group level (both for raw and JND-normalised
metrics). This needs to be acknowledged and the implications discussed.
‘Any repulsive after-effect can be considered evidence for selective suppression’ [Line 46]. I doubt
very much that the authors believe this statement to be true. Repulsive aftereffects could occur for
a variety of reasons - better not to perpetuate this over-simplification.
I assume from Figure 2C that the ‘different SF’ condition used the same house image in all cases.
This could be made explicit in the text.
Please clarify whether orientation filtering in Experiment 2 was done before or after applying the
adapt/test tilt.
[Line 277]. Given there was spatial overlap between adapting and test stimuli, it is misleading to
say that they were ‘presented to different parts of the retina’.

The manuscript describes experiments where human subjects were exposed to images of houses,
using a standard visual adaptation procedure. After-effects were estimated as bias in the
perceived orientation of houses. The authors show that close to vertical houses affect the
perceived orientation of vertical houses, as expected, but most surprisingly also of horizontal
houses. This is an unexpected result, not observed with simple stimuli such as gratings and bars.
It seems that low-level visual processes cannot predict effects of adaptation to natural images.
Detailed comments
Experiment 1:
This experiment appears to be carefully designed and operated. The p-value in one condition is
only marginally significant, but I don't think it's a concern. However, the conclusion seems
somewhat weaker than stated. The authors argue that "when after-effects survive manipulations
of image and size such as ours, their origin cannot be attributed to low-level visual mechanisms".
Although the authors attempted to limit low level interactions by using different size and center
for adapting and testing stimuli, they cannot ignore the large spatial overlap that remained. So
the main evidence remaining in favor of the authors' conclusion seems to be that the magnitude
of perceptual bias is similar for 'Same house', 'Different house' and 'Different SF house' conditions
(i.e. with and without frequency overlap in adaptation and test). This needs to be stated explicitly
and the conclusion needs to be weakened, because: (a) ruling out a low-level origin is inherently
weaker when adapt and test are spatially overlapping, (b) even after frequency filtering using
global Fourier transform some local frequency content can survive, and (c) the 'Different SF
house' images were scaled to have a set RMS contrast, perhaps increasing their adaptation
strength (what are the scaling factors?). Also, some of the house images apparently used in
'Different SF house' are not used in the other two conditions, but I don't think this point is a
concern.
This experiment has additional merit in that it verified the existence of TAE when using natural
images for both adaptation and test (unlike Dekel & Sagi 2015 who used Gabor tests).

Experiment 2:
1. The adaptors and tests in both 'Orthogonal house' and 'Phase-scrambled house' conditions (as
depicted in figure 3) appear synthetic and artificial and certainly not house-like. But the main
conclusion of the authors seem to be that "We attribute this repulsion to our images'
recognisability as slightly tilted houses" (line 289). The deduction here is completely unclear to
me.
2. The H1 and H2 adaptors for 'Orthogonal house' condition (as depicted in figure 3) appear to
have strong CW-tilted content. Why? Is it the CW-tilted adaptor?
3. Subjects "chose which of the two test houses appeared more upright" (line 151), but the test
stimuli were strongly horizontal (figure 3, 'Test'). I am not certain how a subject would interpret
"more upright" for such tests, and whether this would have more far-reaching implications for
the interpretation of the results.
Minor issues:
- Was head orientation constrained or controlled in any way?
- What house images are used for 'Different SF house' in experiment 1?
Line 170 writes "Two observers were tested on each of the 3 images used (H2, H4 & H5; figure
2B)", which implies that the used images are H2, H4 & H5, but the depicted image in figure 2B for
'Different SF house' does not appear to be any of H1-H5.
- Lines 41-43: "either via fatigue of the adapted neurons or lateral inhibition between neurons
with similar orientation preferences" - aren't there other alternatives?
- Line 46: "for selective suppression, and has; with popularity" - missing sentence?
- Line 52: "stimulus values" -> stimulus features?
- Lines 53-54: "For example, if a thick, masculine eyebrow suppresses a few neurons that prefer
(low spatial frequency) shapes like that," - not clear
- Line 183: "In the frequency domain" -> in the orientation domain?
- Line 185: "with a half-bandwidth at half-height" - does this mean the STD of the Gaussian?
- Lines 276-277: "adapting and test images, which are presented to different parts of the retina" -
this is misleading, since there is much overlap, albeit not for the same image regions.
- Line 277: "share not spatial frequency components" - as stated earlier locally there is frequency
overlap, only weaker than for the unfiltered images.
- Lines 290-291: "In support of this viewpoint, we found no after-effect when the Fourier phases
of our adaptors were scrambled" - but a statistically significant albeit weak TAE was found
(tables 1&2, p-value for 'Phase-scrambled house').
- Lines 319-321: "In support of this ..." - how can an experimental design decision support a
conclusion? not clear.

Appendix A
We thank the reviewers for their helpful comments that we address below. We have
made the corresponding changes in the paper, and believe that it has much benefitted
from this.
Reviewer #1
This reviewer found the paper interesting and suggests some changes that we address
below (our responses are in italic).
1. In several places in the paper it is stated that adaptation to phase-scrambled houses
did not produce a repulsive TAE (e.g. lines 28-29; 290-291). While the effect was
relatively small in this condition, it did reach statistical significance at the group level
(both for raw and JND-normalised metrics). This needs to be acknowledged and the
implications discussed.
We have revised the discussion section and added 2 paragraphs discussing the
significant group level repulsion from adaptation to phase-scrambled houses and
comparing it to the findings with orientation-filtered houses. See lines 275-293.
We have amended the abstract to acknowledge this too.
2. ‘Any repulsive after-effect can be considered evidence for selective suppression’
[Line 46]. I doubt very much that the authors believe this statement to be true.
Repulsive aftereffects could occur for a variety of reasons - better not to perpetuate
this over-simplification.
Yes we agree, normalization (for example) needn’t be selective suppression. We have
changed this in the text. See lines 47-48.
3. I assume from Figure 2C that the ‘different SF’ condition used the same house
image in all cases. This could be made explicit in the text.
In the different SF condition, the same house was used as adaptor and test, but we
had three different houses, such that 2 observers were tested with any one house.
Another two observers were tested with a different house and the final two observers
were tested with a third one. We have clarified this on lines 170-171.
4. Please clarify whether orientation filtering in Experiment 2 was done before or
after applying the adapt/test tilt.
The adaptor houses were tilted and then filtered. The test images were initially
filtered and then tilted. This has been clarified in lines 179-184.
5. Given there was spatial overlap between adapting and test stimuli, it is misleading
to say that they were ‘presented to different parts of the retina’.
This is true; we have changed this in the paper (lines 82-83, 257).
6. [Line 100] Iiyama
Corrected (see line 106).
7. [Line 104] Mathworks
Corrected (see line 110).
Responses to reviewer #2
We thank the reviewer for the helpful comments and reply to their queries below.
1. The authors argue that "when after-effects survive manipulations of image and size
such as ours, their origin cannot be attributed to low-level visual mechanisms".
Although the authors attempted to limit low-level interactions by using different size
and center for adapting and testing stimuli, they cannot ignore the large spatial
overlap that remained. So the main evidence remaining in favor of the authors'
conclusion seems to be that the magnitude of perceptual bias is similar for 'Same
house', 'Different house' and 'Different SF house' conditions (i.e. with and without
frequency overlap in adaptation and test). This needs to be stated explicitly and the
conclusion needs to be weakened, because:
(a) ruling out a low-level origin is inherently weaker when adapt and
test are spatially overlapping
(b) even after frequency filtering using global Fourier transform some
local frequency content can survive, and
It is true that there was some spatial overlap in the stimuli. We have removed
the “such as ours” from this sentence here (lines 259-261) and also changed
lines 257-258 to discuss the partial overlap and spatial frequency difference in
our stimuli.
(c) the 'Different SF house' images were scaled to have a set RMS
contrast, perhaps increasing their adaptation strength (what are the
scaling factors?). Also, some of the house images apparently used
in 'Different SF house' are not used in the other two conditions, but
I don't think this point is a concern.
Yes, adaptors and tests in this condition were scaled to have a set RMS
contrast. In the ‘same house’ and ‘different house’ conditions, the tests had
either similar or slightly larger RMS contrast (approx. a 0.05 difference) than
adapting images. In the ‘different SF house’ condition, prior to filtering,
adapting and test images had similar RMS contrasts (0.4, 0.6 and 0.5 for
images H2, H4 and H5 respectively). After filtering all adapting images had
an RMS contrast of 0.10 and tests had an RMS contrast of 0.18. See lines 130-
132. However, a contrast difference would not have affected the strength of
the after-effects. In our ‘different SF house’ condition, the adaptors had a
smaller RMS contrast (0.10) than the tests (0.18). According to the literature
(Parker (1972); Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 24(1)), if the
adaptor’s contrast is higher than the test, the size of the after-effect increases
and if it is lower than the test, then the size decreases. So if anything, RMS
contrasts we used should have only reduced the size of the after-effect but not
increased.
The reason we used different house images in the ‘Different SF house’
condition was to increase the range of images used.
2. This experiment has additional merit in that it verified the existence of TAE when
using natural images for both adaptation and test (unlike Dekel & Sagi 2015 who used
Gabor tests).
True, we have included this in the paper (lines 261-263).
3. The adaptors and tests in both 'Orthogonal house' and 'Phase-scrambled house'
conditions (as depicted in figure 3) appear synthetic and artificial and certainly not
house-like. But the main conclusion of the authors seem to be that "We attribute this
repulsion to our images' recognisability as slightly tilted houses" (line 289). The
deduction here is completely unclear to me.
It is true that we did not ask participants to judge whether they recognized the
orientation-filtered scenes. However, these images always contained structure that
made them perceptually different to the phase scrambled images (this is more easily
seen if the figure 3 is enlarged). We include a discussion of this in lines 275-293.
4. The H1 and H2 adaptors for 'Orthogonal house' condition (as depicted in figure 3)
appear to have strong CW-tilted content. Why? Is it the CW-tilted adaptor?
Yes, these are examples of CW tilted adaptors and this has now been clearly
mentioned in the legend of figure 3 (see line 486).
5. Subjects "chose which of the two test houses appeared more upright" (line 151),
but the test stimuli were strongly horizontal (figure 3, 'Test'). I am not certain how a
subject would interpret "more upright" for such tests, and whether this would have
more far-reaching implications for the interpretation of the results.
Although the test images contained strongly horizontal content only, observers are
able to judge “upright” in these images (notice the baselines in figure3A are similar
in size and variance to those measured with unfiltered images). This suggests that
people are capable of making judgments of “upright” using horizontal information.
6. Was head orientation constrained or controlled in any way?
Head was not constrained but participants were given specific instructions to keep
their heads upright and we have included a sentence on this in lines 104-105.
7. What house images are used for 'Different SF house' in experiment 1?
We have clarified this in lines 170-171.
8. Line 170 writes "Two observers were tested on each of the 3 images used (H2, H4
& H5; figure 2B)", which implies that the used images are H2, H4 & H5, but the
depicted image in figure 2B for 'Different SF house' does not appear to be any of H1-
H5.
Thank you for pointing out this oversight on our part. Figure 2 has been modified to
include an image of the house we used in our ‘different SF’ condition.
9. Lines 41-43: "either via fatigue of the adapted neurons or lateral inhibition between
neurons with similar orientation preferences" - aren't there other alternatives?
These are the most common mechanistic accounts; although there are rare cases,
which for example suggest other alternatives like facilitatory mechanisms (Ursino,
Magosso & Cuppini (2008); Vision Research, 48(13)). We have clarified this (lines
40-43).
10. Line 46: "for selective suppression, and has; with popularity" - missing sentence?
We have clarified the meaning of this sentence. See lines 47-49
11. Line 52: "stimulus values" -> stimulus features? Lines 53-54: "For example, if a
thick, masculine eyebrow suppresses a few neurons that prefer (low spatial frequency)
shapes like that," - not clear
We think “Stimulus values” is the best use of words in this context. It is important that
readers do not confuse features (like orientation and shape) with feature values (like
vertical and square). Individual (low-level) neurones can be tuned to feature values,
not features. Neural populations (comprised by neurones tuned to various feature
values) consequently encode features. To clarify this, we have also revised lines 54-
57.
12. Line 183: "In the frequency domain" -> in the orientation domain?
Corrected (see line 184).
13. Line 185: "with a half-bandwidth at half-height" - does this mean the STD of the
Gaussian?
The half-width at half height = v2 ln 2  ˜ 1.18  , where  is the standard
deviation (or the orientation constant) of the Gaussian filter. We have corrected the
actual value (see line 186). The standard deviation of our filter was 20° and therefore
the half-width at half height is 23.5°. We prefer to use the half-width at half-height for
consistency, as we have defined the log-normal spatial frequency filter in the same
manner.
14. Lines 276-277: "adapting and test images, which are presented to different parts
of the retina" - this is misleading, since there is much overlap, albeit not for the same
image regions.
Sentence revised (see line 257).
15. Line 277: "share not spatial frequency components" - as stated earlier locally there
is frequency overlap, only weaker than for the unfiltered images.
Sentence revised (see line 258).
16. Lines 290-291: "In support of this viewpoint, we found no after-effect when the
Fourier phases of our adaptors were scrambled" - but a statistically significant albeit
weak TAE was found (tables 1&2, p-value for 'Phase-scrambled house').
We have revised the discussion to address this point.
17. Lines 319-321: "In support of this ..." - how can an experimental design decision
support a conclusion? not clear.
We have clarified this in lines 302-306.
