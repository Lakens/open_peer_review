Vocal development in early ontogeny has been relatively neglected and is interesting for a wide
variety of reasons, the ones presented in the Introduction being only a subset. The experiment
uses a straightforward approach to yield very interesting results (judging from the figures; I
confess I can't properly assess the statistics used here; see below).
I hope the authors find some of these suggestions/queries useful:
l. 16-18 Is it really the first? I would think that the cross-fostering experiments of Beecher,
Leonard, Lessells, and Reers et al would count.
l. 27 ff (Introduction) I'm not sure I would have introduced the study as a contribution to the
study of begging behaviour, since it's interesting enough as a study of early vocal ontogeny and
the begging theme isn't returned to in the Discussion. Given that it is introduced in this way,
however, it would be good to add a section to the Discussion outlining the implications of this
work for the study of begging. I'm not sure the implications are as novel for begging research as
they are for research on vocal ontogeny, so you might decide to revise the Introduction rather
than the Discussion.
l. 61-63 Same comment applies here as for l. 16-18. Also, there's been more work on parasitic birds
besides this, e.g. cowbirds by Zanette's group, and Payne's early stuff on widowbirds. So perhaps
just rephrase to make it clear that this is just one example?
l. 102-105 Was this true of all chicks? In other words, there were no genetic siblings or genetic
offspring of the foster parents within any given brood? Of course, it's quite important that there
weren't, so I'd recommend rephrasing to be explicit on this point.
1. 113-115 It's reassuring that the overall sex ratio was about the same between foster species, but
what's more important is that it was similar at the brood level; i.e., one foster species didn't tend
to have single-sex broods, while the other tended to have mixed-sex broods. So I would give
something like the median and ranges of the sex ratios per brood.
l. 134-135 Is this stimulus equally effective for cross-fostered chicks? I ask because the beaks of the
two species are different colours, so readers need reassurance that the results are not attributable
to weaker responses to the stimulus.
l. 178 ff This strikes me as a complex statistical approach to use on a pretty modest sample size
(16 and 8 nests). But I confess I'm unable to properly evaluate the stats used here, not having used
them myself.
l. 196-198 I can imagine why it would be good to use this PCA approach after the LMM on
individual call features, but it would be good to give the rationale for it somewhere in the paper,
perhaps here, for other readers (and for me, in case I'm in favour of it for the wrong reasons!).
l. 304 ff The growth results do suggest that the call differences aren't because of differences in
physiology, but they don't entirely rule out the possibility. E.g., the different patterns of care in
the two species could lead to differences that aren't manifested in standard measures of growth.
So I would qualify the statement just a bit.
l. 334 ff Do you have evidence that rules out feeding schedule per se as a cause of the call
differences? E.g., when zebra finches are raised on different feeding schedules, does that change
their begging calls? If not, then that would support your argument that the parent's responses to
the calls is part of the cause of the differences.

Beyond that, I would only add that, throughout the ms, there are a few minor lapses in standard
English usage -- but these can be easily fixed.

This study investigates developmental plasticity of begging calls in zebra finch nestlings reared
by conspecific or Bengalese finch (i.e. heterospecific parents). The authors have conducted
detailed bioacoustic analyses of calls recorded from 50 chicks to test whether calls structure is
adjusted with respect to parental species. This is a challenging and poorly understood field and
the study addresses the interesting question as to whether chicks change their begging calls in
different social environments. There are however, some major conceptual issues that have not
clearly addressed by the design nor the authors' discussion of the results. This needs addressing,
as presented the study/design do not fully and unambiguously support the conclusions
Introduction
1) Theory/expectations: I missed a clear outline of what changes are expected under which
scenario, e.g. experience dependent changes such as learning versus growth dependent changes
vs. motivation/intensity dependent changes. A matrix of expectations, with a schematic
overview of predictions (some probably arising from more than one scenario) could be very
helpful in interpreting your results. To illustrate: we could predict that chicks crossfostered
should be become ever more similar to Bengalese finches if parental feeding is a conditioning
process, see e.g. (Kedar, Rodriguez-Girones, Yedvab, Winkler, & Lotem, 2000), where the most
stimulating begging behaviour gets rewarded most (parents showing immediate reactions to
begging intensity e.g. (Davies, Kilner, & Noble, 1998; Lessells, Riebel, & Draganoiu, 2011).
Conversely, if increased hunger because of different feeding regimes affects how intensively
chicks beg then from motivational structural rules (and empirical observations) we can make
specific predictions on which structural parameters should change, e.g. increase in fundamental
4
frequency. I feel that by presenting only the PC1 scores rather than specifically testing parameters
we know to be affected in different situation, the data have not been used to the full.
2) A surprising conceptual omission is the lack of comparison with Bengalese begging calls
uttered at the same age (this would be helpful in finding out whether the calls of the
crossfostered zebra finches are homing in on what stimulates parents best), this is obviously an
issue that can’t be addressed anymore but perhaps can you compare the parameters that changed
most with what is known from Bengalese finch begging calls from the literature (if available).
Methods
3) The design is unbalanced, but this is not discussed. Also selection of data points sample
size in insufficiently described:
line 89 there are double as many zebra finch pairs (ZF: N=16) than pairs of Bengalese finches (BF:
N=8)
line 107 says all parents were given 3 chicks = (16Zf pairs + 8 BF pairs) x 3chicks= 72 chicks.
Line 113 gives sample size = 50 chicks. Some nests must not have used? Or not all chicks from all
nests? Please give breakdown for number of nests per species here as well. Explain selection
criteria for inclusion/exclusion.
4) Sample size: there were 50 chicks (22 Bf reared and 28 ZF reared), but 10 time points, leaving
2.2 BF and 2.8 Zf per time point or 1.1 Bf-reared and 1.4 Zf-reared chick per time point and sex
(while the analyses also have to control for rearing nest and nest of origin as additional factors).
Could you comment on this as this seems to be on the low side to separate treatment and time
effects from individual effects even when you have 3 time points measured per individual?
4) Information on subjects incomplete: age parents both species, was there previous
breeding experience in both species? Were breeding pairs in earshot/visible to breeding pairs of
same or both species? How long prior to experiments were BF purchased and had settled?
Analyses
5) The reasons for the substantial outlier removals are not explained: line 162 states that
there was outlier removal but not why or how the removed calls are distributed over the sampled
individuals categories. The authors state that 97 % of calls remained, but that is hundreds of calls
removed, maybe these extremer PC values show important biological variation? what is the a
priori reason to remove these? Give a breakdown as to how the removed calls were disbributed
across treatments and sex?
6) Zebra finch males and females show different levels of need as nestling, which could
affect growth/begging independent of or interaction with the crossfostering treatment. Please
control therefore for sex ratio in the nest in your analyses.
Presentation of results
7) Please add a visual legend explaining the symbols to all figures (if in line with editorial
policy) at the very least repeat explanation in each figure legend.
8) Fig.3 is very useful as it shows some raw measures of the calls –it would be nice to have
a second example here as well as having both power spectra with the same scales on the axes.
9) Figure 4: because the points are connected by lines one assumes repeated measures, but
this graph shows within and between individual variation without making this visual. There are
3 measures on 3 different time point per chick but for most chicks these are on different days, so
the data are partially crosssectional partly repeated. This results in a figure where identically
looking symbols sometimes represent independent samples and sometimes within subsample
repeated measures. Is there a way of visualizing which 3 points actually belong together?
10) Fig 4: The figure legend states that data points are means and s.e. Of all chicks at a given
age, however, the appendix shows that for some time points there was only one chick in some of
the treatments, how can these points have an s.e. ?
11) A great addition useful for future researchers would be a graph/table with a breakdown
for the main parameters such as fundamental or mean frequency etc.. per treatment age and sex,
so as to give other researchers working on this or related systems an idea of the order of
magnitude of the changes in the calls.
5
Conclusions
12) The authors strongly favour experience dependent change (learning based on social
interactions with parents) as interpretation of their results, their main argument against a growth
related change is the lack of differences in size at age 14. From how I understand the statistical
section and figure 6, mass has been compared between all chicks (please add different symbols
for males and females btw), but recordings are only available for a subset of birds for this age.
Please repeat the analysis only including the birds for which you have call data and body
condition, to exclude that differences in size can be excluded as reason for different calls in the
actual bioacoustic sample. From the text, it was also not clear to my how this analysis tests for
interaction between sex and treatment when checking for an effect of weight, which seems
relevant as there was a sex-treatment interaction of the call parameters.
13) I would expect that as a consequence of learning the calls of Bengalese finch reared
chicks would shift towards the BF higher calls, but what fig. 6 suggests is that after both groups
started of the same, the zebra finch reared group shows more and faster change away from the
joint point of departure. The Bengalese finch reared chicks follow the same trajectory but
timelagged. This suggests to me differential growth more than social/acoustic environment
affecting the calls (as in that case the BF group should show the bigger change away from the
joined point of departure? In other words we would expect two diverging lines?)
14) Isn’t the observation that males show more change in repsonse to the crossfostering
(with less feeding by BF parents) at odds with what one would expected based on the higher
vulnerability/responsiveness to changing/suboptimal conditions in zebra finches e.g. (Martins,
2004)?
15) Supplement: Please transpose table with PCA values, to have the values in the rows and
the PC1 and PC2 in columns for easier comparison.

The revisions have greatly improved the paper. In particular, the design and statistics are much
clearer to me, and the overall predictions and discussion were much improved in response to
suggestions by the other reviewer.

The manuscript should be improved still further through copy editing for standard English usage
throughout.
A couple of minor comments:
l. 55 Change "seems" to "is"?
l. 77-79 I would be more explicit about what it would mean; the previous paragraph offered some
ideas.

General Comments (focused on statistical issues)
This manuscript presents an analysis of how begging call parameters of zebra finch nestlings are
influenced by cross-fostering them by another species. The key methods used are Principal
Components Analyses (PCA) and Mixed models (GLMM). The authors correctly identified Mixed
Model as s tool control for pseudo-replication, and also the use of PCA to remove redundancy in
among the acoustic measures appreciable. However, the main GLMM is somewhat miss-specified
(with regard to the fixed and random effects included) and the approach used for testing is
outdated. I also was a little confused about the details of implementation of the PCA. Finally, in
my opinion, the testing and corresponding presentation of the results could be streamlined and
shortened.
My main concerns are detailed as follows:
PCA: the use of two Principal Components Analyses (L 205-211 & 248-258) is somewhat
confusing and I wonder whether this could be streamlined (or was only one PCA used? This is
somewhat confusing). With regard to the second PCA I also was surprised to see that only 'non-
redundant' parameters (L 253) were included. Isn't it the very purpose of PCA to remove
redundancy from the set of parameters? Also, PCA as a parametric method may suffer from
skewed distributions of the parameters included, and I think it is a good idea to inspect these for
deviations from normality/symmetry/absence of outliers and transform variables in case needed
before including them into the PCA. The total variance explained by the principal components
retained should be mentioned in the main text.
GLMM for acoustic parameters as response:
- intra-brood sex ratio is a quantity and as such should not at all be included as a random effect
but as a fixed effect; the same applies body condition index (BCI; L 229-232).
- since obviously several calls per recording session are included into the analysis (L 240) session
ID (which needs to have a unique label for each combination of subject ID and age) needs to be
included as a further random effect.
- the hunger level or stress of the chicks might increase during the recording sessions. Hence, a
further fixed effect of call number within session should be included (and it might be worth
considering the inclusion of interaction between call number and, e.g., age).
- it is true that MCMC (pvals.fnc) was considered to reveal the most reliable P-values until
recently. However, after the papers by Schielzeth & Forstmeier (2009) and Barr et al. (2013) we
know better. In fact, in order to keep type I error rate close to the nominal level of 0.05 the model
needs to include random slopes of age, sex and, BCI within subject, nest of origin, and foster nest.
Most reliable P-values for fixed effects are then obtained by comparing the full model with
reduced models lacking the fixed effects one at a time (R function drop1). So I feel the appropriate
model would be (in lmer annotation and including also the correlations between the random
intercepts and slopes components):
acoustic parameter ~ group*sex*age + call number + intra-brood sex ratio + BCI + (1 + age +
BCI|subject) + (1+ group + sex + age + intra-brood sex ratio + BCI|nest of origin) + (1 + sex + age
+ BCI|foster nest) + (1|session ID)
and without the correlations between the random intercepts and slopes components included the
model would be
acoustic parameter ~ group*sex*age + call number + intra-brood sex ratio + BCI + (1|subject) +
(1|nest of origin) + (1|foster nest) + (0 + sex|nest of origin) + (0 + sex|foster nest) + (0 +
group|nest of origin) + (0 + age|subject) + (0 + age|nest of origin) + (0 + age|foster nest) + (0 +
intra-brood sex ratio|nest of origin) + (0 + BCI|subject) + (0 + BCI|nest of origin) + (0 +
BCI|foster nest) + (1|session ID)
(no warranty of correct- and completeness for these formulae). Note that the latter model is way
simpler although it looks more complex. Note also that I recommend to manually dummy code
sex and group before including them as random slopes components. Finally note that it might be
needed to also include the (two- or three-way) interactions as random slopes whether this is
required/possible depends on the amount of variation of the respective terms within the levels of
the random factors.
14
- in the literature about mixed models balancing is not considered an issue, and, hence, I do not
really see a need for the repeated random selection of calls and averaging of the results (L 240-
247). Instead, I would just run one model based on all available calls.
GLMM for body condition index (BCI) as response:
Similar to the above GLMM also this model is somewhat miss-specified. In fact, it lacks the
random slopes of age within origin and foster nest. I also did not understand why the model was
simplified (L 265-269) not is it clear what the original full model was. This bears similarity with
stepwise procedures and inappropriate use of model selection both of which has been shown to
come along with severe problems (Whittingham et al. 2006; Mundry R & Nunn CL. 2009; Mundry
2011). Here, the authors should specify the full model tested and report the corresponding
results.
Both GLMMs:
It has been recently shown that inspecting the significance of individual predictors but not the
significance of the full model can lead to greatly inflated type I error rates (Forstmeier &
Schielzeth 2011). Hence, the authors should conduct and report such full-null model
comparisons. Note that the null model should comprise the same random effects structure of the
full model and also may comprise fixed effects not being in the focus of the investigation (e.g.,
condition index in the first GLMM).
Results (L284-343):
I feel this section could be streamlined and shortened considerably. It also suffers from quite
heavy multiple testing. In detail: I do not really understand why the authors use PCA to remove
redundancy among the acoustic parameters but then test each of them individually. In fact,
assuming the principal components derived capture a sufficient amount of variation on the
acoustic parameters and the loadings of the acoustic parameters on them reveal interpretable
principal components, the GLMM could be run on the few principal components rather than all
the acoustic parameters (and results of GLMMs for the latter could be moved to the electronic
appendix). This would streamline this section considerably and also clearly alleviate the
otherwise heavy multiple testing issue.
Specific comments
L 219: it is not the data that need to be normally distributed but the residuals.
L 135 & 144: I guess these were Mann-Whitney U tests; should be explicitly stated. Also sample
sizes should be indicated.
L 154-156: I wonder whether linear regression is appropriate. Although not being an expert in
nestling growth, my intuition is that a non-linear model might be more appropriate.
L 205: I do not see how a PCA can be used to remove outliers (the help of the function dudi.pca
also doesn't say a word about removal of outliers).
L 207. 'Eigenvalue' rather than 'eigen-value'.
L 215-217: perhaps worth mentioning here: in the context of Mixed Models one usually checks for
model stability/absence of influential cases by removing levels of the random effects one at a
time (see Nieuwenhuis et al. 2012 for details and for an R package doing that).
L 219: it is not the data that need to be normally distributed but the residuals of the model(s).
L 226: include the reference for lme4 (in R a call of 'citation("lme4")' reveals that).
L 234: note that whenever a three-way interaction is included in a model the respective lower
terms (two-way interactions and main effects) need to be included as well. In R this can be most
easily ensured by calling the model with the interaction specified as group*sex*age. Note also
that it might be a good idea to z-transform age before inclusion into an interaction (see Schielzeth
2010 for details).
L 240: indicate also the range of calls per subject per age.
L 245-246: I didn't understand this sentence.
L 253: include the reference for package ade4. How was it determined which parameters were
'non redundant'?
15
Electronic supplementary material:
Table 4: I would show standard errors of the estimates. Note also that P-values of main effects
and two-way interactions being included into a three-way interaction do have, at best, a very
limited interpretation, and hence I would not report them.

Your revised manuscript has been commented on by the two original reviewers plus an
additional third reviewer. Based on their comments, I'm afraid the manscript would still need a
lot of work to consider it for publication in Open Science: although the two original reviewers are
mostly positive about the revised version, the third reviewer raises some detailed criticisms of the
analysis you have conducted, which may require completely rerunning your analyses.

Comments to the Author(s)
The revisions have greatly improved the paper. In particular, the design and statistics are much
clearer to me, and the overall predictions and discussion were much improved in response to
suggestions by the other reviewer.
The manuscript should be improved still further through copy editing for standard English usage
throughout.
A couple of minor comments:
l. 55 Change "seems" to "is"?
l. 77-79 I would be more explicit about what it would mean; the previous paragraph offered some
ideas.
l. 97-98 There’s been enough papers published on hunger and begging calls in various species
that I would base the predictions on them, as the previous sentence did, rather than rely on
Morton’s (1977) motivation-structural "rules".

I was happy to see that the authors dealt with all my previous comments very thoroughly and
carefully. Hence, I have only a few very minor comments. Most of them are typos, and suggested
changes with regards to wording and punctuation. However, a few are a little more crucial,
namely those regarding L 130 and 138-139, L 205/Table 1, assumptions of the models (Methods,
general), and Table 3 and respective test; but all these should be easy to be handled, too.

namely those regarding L 130 and 138-139, L 205/Table 1, assumptions of the models (Methods,
general), and Table 3 and respective test; but all these should be easy to be handled, too.

Abstract: Begging calls are signals of need used by young birds to elicit care from adults.
Different theoretical frameworks have been proposed to understand this parent-offspring
communication. But relationships between parental response and begging intensity, or between
begging characteristics and proxies of a young’s need remain puzzling. Few studies have
considered the adjustment of nestling begging features to previous experience as a possible
explanation of these discrepancies. In the present study, we tested the effect of an heterospecific
rearing environment on individual developmental trajectories of the acoustic structure of nestling
begging calls. Fifty-two zebra finch chicks were fostered either to Bengalese finch or to zebra
finch parents, and begging calls were recorded at several stages of nestling development.
Acoustic analyses revealed that the development of the spectral features of the begging calls
differed between experimental conditions: chicks reared by Bengalese finches produced higher
pitched and less broadband begging calls than chicks reared by conspecific parents. Differences
were stronger in males than females and were not explained by differences in growth rate. We
conclude that nestling begging calls can be plastic in response to social interactions with parents.

ewers raise a number of questions and comments, particularly regarding details of the
hodology, that need to be carefully addressed if you were to produce a revision of this
nuscript. At the same time, they have both queried the validity of the statistics that you

ou decided to resubmit this, I strongly recommend reading and complying with the Royal
iety's guidance on presenting statistics in your manuscript. At the same time, I would request
you suggest several reviewers who would be able to comment on the analyses in detail, as
bring in a lot different techniques which may be unduly influencing the validity of the trends

r Editor,
thank you for the opportunity to submit a revised version of our manuscript.

al development in early ontogeny has been relatively neglected and is interesting for a wide
ety of reasons, the ones presented in the Introduction being only a subset. The experiment
s a straightforward approach to yield very interesting results (judging from the figures; I
fess I can't properly assess the statistics used here; see below).
pe the authors find some of these suggestions/queries useful:
thank the reviewer for his/her comments, which improved our manuscript. See our detailed
wers below.
6-18 Is it really the first? I would think that the cross-fostering experiments of Beecher,
nard, Lessells, and Reers et al would count.
corrected this sentence and now make clear that we present ‘an experimental test of the effect
n heterospecific rearing environment on individual developmental trajectories of the acoustic
cture of nestling begging calls’ (see lines 16-18).
7 ff (Introduction) I'm not sure I would have introduced the study as a contribution to the
y of begging behaviour, since it's interesting enough as a study of early vocal ontogeny and
begging theme isn't returned to in the Discussion. Given that it is introduced in this way,
ever, it would be good to add a section to the Discussion outlining the implications of this
k for the study of begging. I'm not sure the implications are as novel for begging research as
y are for research on vocal ontogeny, so you might decide to revise the Introduction rather
the Discussion.
it also allowed us to deal with comments of reviewer 2, we chose to add a section to the
ussion to make clearer the implications of our results for the study of begging behaviour and
ents-offspring communication (lines 470-476).
1-63 Same comment applies here as for l. 16-18.
corrected this sentence as follows: ‘A change in the acoustic structure of begging calls in
onse to experience has mainly been considered in the particular context of host-parasite
ractions’. We also greatly modified the entire paragraph to refere more precisely to the
ting litterature and precise the novelty of our study (line 62).
o, there's been more work on parasitic birds besides this, e.g. cowbirds by Zanette's group, and
ne's early stuff on widowbirds. So perhaps just rephrase to make it clear that this is just one
mple?
ed on this suggestion, we added more examples to this paragraph (lines 64-65 and 70-79).
02-105 Was this true of all chicks? In other words, there were no genetic siblings or genetic
pring of the foster parents within any given brood? Of course, it's quite important that there
en't, so I'd recommend rephrasing to be explicit on this point.
chick was reared by its genetic parents. We added this precision to the methods to clarify this
nt. (line 126)
13-115 It's reassuring that the overall sex ratio was about the same between foster species, but
t's more important is that it was similar at the brood level; i.e., one foster species didn't tend
ave single-sex broods, while the other tended to have mixed-sex broods. So I would give
ething like the median and ranges of the sex ratios per brood.
agree that this relevant information was missing in the original manuscript. We now give the
a-brood sex ratio for each experimental group and it shows that, it did not differ between
er species. A table has been added in ESM (table 2) and a sentence has been added in the
nuscript (Methods, paragraph B, line 142):‘The intra-brood sex-ratio was calculated as the
o of the number of females on the number of males (ESM table 2). Sex ratio did not differ
ween the two groups (0.56 and 0.54 for ZFR and BFR groups respectively, W = 43, p-value =
.’
34-135 Is this stimulus equally effective for cross-fostered chicks? I ask because the beaks of
two species are different colours, so readers need reassurance that the results are not
ibutable to weaker responses to the stimulus.
il day 8 or 9 after hatching, the eyes of the chicks are still closed so only the mechanic
ulation with the stick triggered begging calls. After this age, it was still easy to trigger
ging calls with the stick, mainly because chicks were fasten for few hours before recordings.
total number of calls obtained comes as a proof of the efficiency of this method in both
erimental groups. We added these precisions (lines 168-172).
78 ff This strikes me as a complex statistical approach to use on a pretty modest sample size
and 8 nests). But I confess I'm unable to properly evaluate the stats used here, not having
d them myself.
are sorry the information was not clear. The statistics tested the effect of the cross-fostering
tment, the sex and the age on a sample of 15 calls per chick per age. On average one chick
recorded 2.5 times during the experiment and the number of chicks is on average 25 per
erimental group. So the actual sample size is 15 (calls)*2.5 (recording sessions)*25
jects)* 2 (experimental groups) = 1875 calls used in each statistical test. The actual sample
of our recordings was even bigger (10621 calls), but unbalanced between subjects and age.
avoid an arbitrary choice on which calls to use for the statistics, we used a bootstrap method
ick a different sample of calls for each iteration of the test, run the test 10 times, and use the
rage values of the 10 iterations as a result. The information has been added to the manuscript
we hope this will help readers fully understanding the sample size and the statistical
cedure (Methods paragraph F1, lines 235-241).
96-198 I can imagine why it would be good to use this PCA approach after the LMM on
vidual call features, but it would be good to give the rationale for it somewhere in the paper,
haps here, for other readers (and for me, in case I'm in favour of it for the wrong reasons!).
aragraph has been added in the manuscript, and a reference in the bibliography (Methods,
agraph F2, lines 244-247).
04 ff The growth results do suggest that the call differences aren't because of differences in
siology, but they don't entirely rule out the possibility. E.g., the different patterns of care in
two species could lead to differences that aren't manifested in standard measures of growth.
I would qualify the statement just a bit.
toned down our statement by adding a sentence (lines 389-392).
34 ff Do you have evidence that rules out feeding schedule per se as a cause of the call
erences? E.g., when zebra finches are raised on different feeding schedules, does that change
r begging calls? If not, then that would support your argument that the parent's responses to
calls is part of the cause of the differences.
ortunately, there is no such study in the literature to our knowledge.
clarified our predictions in the introduction to help in apprehending the conclusions of our
y (lines 94): “the cross-fostering treatment could represent a developmental stress. If chicks
ed by Bengalese finch parents are less fed and thus hungrier, begging calls are expected to be
ger, emitted at a higher call rate and with more spectral noise”.
also now make clearer conclusions based on these predictions (discussion, lines 369-383):
e found no effect of the cross-fostering group neither on call duration, nor on call rate (inter-
interval), nor on spectral noise (spectral entropy). In young nestlings, inter-call interval was
n longer (so call rate lower) in chicks reared by Bengalese finch parents than in chicks reared
ebra finch parents. (…). So differences in acoustic structure of begging calls do not seem to
xplained by differences between experimental groups neither in growth nor in motivation to
linked to different level of parental care”.
ond that, I would only add that, throughout the ms, there are a few minor lapses in standard
lish usage -- but these can be easily fixed.

s study investigates developmental plasticity of begging calls in zebra finch nestlings reared
onspecific or Bengalese finch (i.e. heterospecific parents). The authors have conducted
iled bioacoustic analyses of calls recorded from 50 chicks to test whether calls structure is
usted with respect to parental species. This is a challenging and poorly understood field and
study addresses the interesting question as to whether chicks change their begging calls in
erent social environments. There are however, some major conceptual issues that have not
rly addressed by the design nor the authors' discussion of the results. This needs addressing,
resented the study/design do not fully and unambiguously support the conclusions
thank the reviewer for his/her comments, which improved our manuscript. See our detailed
wers below.
oduction
Theory/expectations: I missed a clear outline of what changes are expected under which
nario, e.g. experience dependent changes such as learning versus growth dependent changes
motivation/intensity dependent changes. A matrix of expectations, with a schematic overview
redictions (some probably arising from more than one scenario) could be very helpful in
rpreting your results. To illustrate: we could predict that chicks crossfostered should be
ome ever more similar to Bengalese finches if parental feeding is a conditioning process, see
(Kedar, Rodriguez-Girones, Yedvab, Winkler, & Lotem, 2000), where the most stimulating
ging behaviour gets rewarded most (parents showing immediate reactions to begging intensity
(Davies, Kilner, & Noble, 1998; Lessells, Riebel, & Draganoiu, 2011). Conversely, if
eased hunger because of different feeding regimes affects how intensively chicks beg then
m motivational structural rules (and empirical observations) we can make specific predictions
which structural parameters should change, e.g. increase in fundamental frequency.
requested, we modified the end of the introduction to add an outline of our predictions under
h potential scenario (lines 89-105). Moreover, we also clarified how our results confirm or not
e predictions in the discussion (lines 371-389).
el that by presenting only the PC1 scores rather than specifically testing parameters we know
e affected in different situation, the data have not been used to the full.
h parameter was actually tested separately before doing the PC1 score and results are
ented for both analyses (see results lines 285-311 and in the next paragraph 312-321).
A surprising conceptual omission is the lack of comparison with Bengalese begging calls
red at the same age (this would be helpful in finding out whether the calls of the crossfostered
ra finches are homing in on what stimulates parents best), this is obviously an issue that can’t
ddressed anymore but perhaps can you compare the parameters that changed most with what
nown from Bengalese finch begging calls from the literature (if available).
ortunately, no data are available on the acoustic structure of Bengalese finch begging calls in
literature.
added new data as supplementary materials to the revised version of the manuscript: the same
galese finch parents as the ones used as foster parents for zebra finch young, were used to
duce and rear Bengalese finch chicks. We did not get enough Bengalese finch chicks to cross-
er them between Bengalese finch parents (six nestlings = three females and three males), but
same protocol was used to trigger and record begging calls (chicks were fasten and stimulated
same way as in the hetero specific cross fostering experiment).
s, we now provide examples of Bengalese finch begging calls at 14 (±1) DPH in ESM figure
hich allow us to describe the spectro-temporal features of these calls. We also provide a
parison of the acoustic structures of these Bengalese finch begging calls to the begging calls
he experimental groups of the cross-fostering experiment (ESM table 13 and ESM figure 5).
ebra finch chicks reared by Bengalese finch parents are homing in on what stimulates parents
, that is the acoustic structure of begging calls of Bengalese finch chicks, then we predict that
acoustic structure of begging calls of zebra finch chicks reared by Bengalese finch parents
be intermediate between the two control groups (zebra finch chicks reared by zebra finch
ents and Bengalese finch chicks reared by Bengalese finch parents).
make this comparison between the three groups, we first performed a Linear Discriminant
lysis (LDA) on all non-redundant acoustic parameters using the calls of the two control
ups. We then used the new acoustic space obtained from this LDA to compare begging calls
ebra finch chicks reared by Bengalese finch parents with the two control groups. As
dicted, acoustic features of begging calls emitted by zebra finch chicks reared by Bengalese
h parents are intermediate between the two control groups (ESM figure 5).
are aware that our sample size is not sufficient to perform a thorough comparison, but we
k these results are still strengthening our initial argument and are in favour of our hypothesis
zebra finch chicks can modify the structure of their begging calls towards what is most
ulating to the parents (discussion Lines 400-413).
hods
The design is unbalanced, but this is not discussed. Also selection of data points sample
in insufficiently described:
89 there are double as many zebra finch pairs (ZF: N=16) than pairs of Bengalese finches
: N=8).
107 says all parents were given 3 chicks = (16Zf pairs + 8 BF pairs) x 3chicks= 72 chicks.
e 113 gives sample size = 50 chicks. Some nests must not have used? Or not all chicks from
nests? Please give breakdown for number of nests per species here as well. Explain selection
eria for inclusion/exclusion.
clarified this issue in the manuscript. We did not use any selection process of neither subjects
recordings (method, D, line 159) ‘All chicks were recorded at three different developmental
es (6±1, 9±1, 14±1 DPH) after removing the chick from the nest temporally.’
average, foster parents received three chicks, but depending on chicks hatching date and
chrony between nests of origin, it was sometime not possible to complete all foster nests up to
e chicks. We added a table in the ESM giving median brood size and range of variation for
h experimental groups (see ESM, table 2). We also added information on chicks’ mortality to
w that there was no difference in mortality between experimental groups (21.8% in BFR,
33% in ZFR, X2, 1= 0.0085, p=0.92)(see methods, paragraph B, lines 130-136).
ample size: there were 50 chicks (22 Bf reared and 28 ZF reared), but 10 time points, leaving
BF and 2.8 Zf per time point or 1.1 Bf-reared and 1.4 Zf-reared chick per time point and sex
ile the analyses also have to control for rearing nest and nest of origin as additional factors).
ld you comment on this as this seems to be on the low side to separate treatment and time
cts from individual effects even when you have 3 time points measured per individual?
exact number of subjects of each sex and each age class is given in table 1 of the ESM.
ple size in each age class and each sex was indeed low, but this is why we chose not to
sider three age classes but age as a continuous covariate for the statistics. The statistical
del tests the effect of the social treatment in interaction with the age as a covariate. We added
following clarification to the methods paragraph F (line 236): ‘Because the age was analysed
continuous covariate, the effect of the social treatment was not analysed for each age point
arately but on changes of parameters over the development’. We also clarified the legend of
figures (see legend fig.1, fig.2, fig.4 , lines 811, 822, 839).
Information on subjects incomplete: age parents both species, was there previous breeding
erience in both species? Were breeding pairs in earshot/visible to breeding pairs of same or
h species? How long prior to experiments were BF purchased and had settled?
re information on foster parents has been added (Methods A, l. 112), especially on age, pair
mation, prior breeding experience and settlement of purchased Bengalese finches. Information
ut housing conditions of the two experimental groups is now available in paragraph B) of the
hods (see line 137), in particular, the two experimental groups were housed in separate rooms,
ally and acoustically isolated.
lyses
The reasons for the substantial outlier removals are not explained: line 162 states that
e was outlier removal but not why or how the removed calls are distributed over the sampled
viduals categories. The authors state that 97 % of calls remained, but that is hundreds of calls
oved, maybe these extremer PC values show important biological variation? what is the a
ri reason to remove these? Give a breakdown as to how the removed calls were disbributed
ss treatments and sex?
ble has been added in ESM (table 11) and gives a breakdown of the number of calls removed
m the analysis per group, age and sex. A sentence was added to the manuscript to refer to this
e (see paragraph F, line 210):‘ for the composition of the outlier data set see ESM table 11’ .
ially the data did not fit a normal distribution, which prevented us to use linear models. A
A on all the data set using all the non-redundant parameters was performed to identify outliers.
values higher/lower of the average PC ±3SD of each experimental group were considered as
iers.
ethod to make sure the outliers we removed from the analyses did not change our
clusions is to compare the conclusions of the statistics with and without outliers. As outliers
vented us to use linear models on each parameter separately, we used the principal
ponents obtained from the multivariate analysis (methods, paragraph F2 and results, line 311)
calculated the coordinates of the outlier calls in this PCA acoustic space. The statistics were
on PC1 with these additional calls. This did not change the major conclusion: developmental
ectories in begging call acoustic features are changed in male nestlings reared by Bengalese
h parents but not female nestlings (ESM, table 12, line 110 for statistics and ESM figure 3). A
ence has been added to the manuscript to refer to this additional analysis (Methods, paragraph
ine 214): ‘ To test the impact of removing outliers on conclusions, coordinates of the outlier
s were calculated in the PCA space used for the multivarariate analysis (‘suprow’ function of
e4’ R package) (ESM, table 12 and ESM figure 3).’
Zebra finch males and females show different levels of need as nestling, which could
ct growth/begging independent of or interaction with the crossfostering treatment. Please
trol therefore for sex ratio in the nest in your analyses.
ble of intra-brood sex-ratio has been added to the ESM (table 2).
statistics were all re-done adding the intra-brood sex-ratio as random factor. This did change
e p-values but the conclusions and significances remained unchanged, except for the
tivariate analysis: the interaction between treatment and age was no longer significant in
ales but remained significant in males. So this did not change our main conclusion. The most
plete model, with the intra brood sex-ratio has then been kept and all the statistical tables
e been changed in ESM.
also changed the statistics method in the manuscript (paragraph F line 228: ‘The subject, the
ntity of the nest of origin, the identity of the foster nest and the intra-brood sex-ratio were set
andom factors to control for chick’s identity, genetic background and environmental
ditions of development’). The sex ratio as random factor also now appears in all table legends
SM and figure legends.
sentation of results
Please add a visual legend explaining the symbols to all figures (if in line with editorial
cy) at the very least repeat explanation in each figure legend.
ual legends have been added to all figures.
Fig.3 is very useful as it shows some raw measures of the calls –it would be nice to have a
ond example here as well as having both power spectra with the same scales on the axes.
same y-axis scale is now used in all spectra as requested; we would like to underline that this
xis only represents relative amplitude.
r additional examples of begging call spectra (two per experimental group) have been added
igure 3 of the manuscript. An additional figure in ESM now depicts begging call acoustic
ures of 5/6 days old nestlings and 8/9 days old nestlings of the two groups (ESM see figure 2,
63).
Figure 4: because the points are connected by lines one assumes repeated measures, but
graph shows within and between individual variation without making this visual. There are 3
sures on 3 different time point per chick but for most chicks these are on different days, so
data are partially cross sectional partly repeated. This results in a figure where identically
king symbols sometimes represent independent samples and sometimes within subsample
eated measures. Is there a way of visualizing which 3 points actually belong together?
data set is indeed partially cross sectional and partly repeated. A figure with individual points
ach recorded age and showing individual developmental trajectories of call features for all
viduals has been now added in ESM (ESM figure 1). Additionally, the lines connecting
nts between age classes have been removed in all figures to avoid any confusion with fully
eated measures (see fig 1,2,4,5 and legends lines 811, 822,,839, 851).
Fig 4: The figure legend states that data points are means and s.e. Of all chicks at a given
, however, the appendix shows that for some time points there was only one chick in some of
treatments, how can these points have an s.e. ?
corrected this point. Data points are now mean + s.e. when the corresponding subset of data
tains several chicks, and mean only (without error bar) when the data point represents only
chick. The data set for one chick at a given age still represents multiple calls, so the
esponding data point is the mean on all these calls of the considered parameter (see fig
4,5 and legends lines 811, 822,839, 851).
A great addition useful for future researchers would be a graph/table with a breakdown for
main parameters such as fundamental or mean frequency etc.. per treatment age and sex, so as
ive other researchers working on this or related systems an idea of the order of magnitude of
changes in the calls.
ble of the mean values of the main acoustic parameters per sex, cross-fostering group and age
ses has been added to the ESM (table 10, line 96).
clusions
The authors strongly favour experience dependent change (learning based on social
ractions with parents) as interpretation of their results, their main argument against a growth
ted change is the lack of differences in size at age 14. From how I understand the statistical
ion and figure 6, mass has been compared between all chicks (please add different symbols
males and females btw), but recordings are only available for a subset of birds for this age.
ase repeat the analysis only including the birds for which you have call data and body
dition, to exclude that differences in size can be excluded as reason for different calls in the
al bioacoustic sample. From the text, it was also not clear to my how this analysis tests for
raction between sex and treatment when checking for an effect of weight, which seems
vant as there was a sex-treatment interaction of the call parameters.
requested, we now use a different symbol for males and females in Figure 6. We also repeated
analysis including only the birds for which we have both call data and body condition at age
This did not change the results, and this is now specified in methods (line 273).
I would expect that as a consequence of learning the calls of Bengalese finch reared
ks would shift towards the BF higher calls, but what fig. 6 suggests is that after both groups
ted of the same, the zebra finch reared group shows more and faster change away from the
t point of departure. The Bengalese finch reared chicks follow the same trajectory but
elagged. This suggests to me differential growth more than social/acoustic environment
cting the calls (as in that case the BF group should show the bigger change away from the
ed point of departure? In other words we would expect two diverging lines?)
frequency spectrum is expected to shift to lower frequencies as chicks get older, bigger and
vier (Sacchi et al. 2002). We clarified this point in introduction (line 85), in the results (line
) and in the discussion (line 352). We thus expected the begging calls of all chicks to show a
ative correlation between age and parameters like the mean, the median, the Q25, the Q75.
our results show that this normal developmental shift was influenced by the cross-fostering
up: it was slower in male chicks reared by Bengalese finch parents than in male chicks reared
ebra finch parents. So we indeed observed two diverging lines of development: both groups
ted at a joint point of departure. If the development of chicks reared by Bengalese finch
ents was simply timelagged, we would expect two parallel lines of vocal development, and to
sure a difference in body condition at day 14, when the difference in acoustic structure of
s is the most important. We did not find this difference. We thus hypothesize that the normal
elopmental shift towards low frequency is modified in chicks reared by Bengalese finch
ents by another process, which could be the impact of the social/acoutic environment. We
e this is now clearer. We deeply reorganized both the end of the introduction (lines XX) and
discussion (lines XX) to make our point clearer.
Isn’t the observation that males show more change in response to the cross fostering (with
feeding by BF parents) at odds with what one would expected based on the higher
nerability/responsiveness to changing/suboptimal conditions in zebra finches e.g. (Martins,
4)?
have no proof that BF parents fed less their offspring as we did not find any effect on body
dition of the cross-fostering treatment. The observation that males show more change in
onse to the cross fostering could be explained by the fact that they get more occasions to test
efficiency of their begging calls’ structure by trial and error (see Discussion lines 418-422).
eed, young males beg with more intensity in the first days after hatching (von Engelhardt et
2006) and male nestlings receive more food than females (Mainwaring, Lucy & Hartley 2011)
Discussion line 416).
ale zebra finches indeed show higher vulnerability to developmental stress (Martins 2004;
ncer & Verhulst 2007; Monaghan 2008). As the cross-fostering treatment did not affect body
dition neither in males nor in females, we think this actually stengthen the rejection of the
othesis of a differential growth between experimental groups. We added this argument to the
ussion (see Discussion lines382-389).
Supplement: Please transpose table with PCA values, to have the values in the rows and
PC1 and PC2 in columns for easier comparison.

are not sure to locate correctly the lines pointed by the reviewer, so we are sorry if we
understood the comment. We indeed acknowledge this possibility in the introduction (see
s 45) ‘Parents, on one hand, may learn to ignore or pay particular attention to some aspects of
r offspring’s begging. Parents show varied levels of sensitivity to offspring’s signals, both
ween and within species [7,19]’.
parents react to higher intensity begging with more feeding, which seems relevant to mention
e as whether the changes come about by different motivational state (BF) or indeed changed
ontogeny is an important discussion point.

Comments to the Author:
Your revised manuscript has been commented on by the two original reviewers plus an
additional third reviewer. Based on their comments, I'm afraid the manscript would
still need a lot of work to consider it for publication in Open Science: although the two
original reviewers are mostly positive about the revised version, the third reviewer
raises some detailed criticisms of the analysis you have conducted, which may require
completely rerunning your analyses.
Dear Associate Editor,
Thank you for accepting to review a revised version of our manuscript ID RSOS-150060
entitled “Parental Influence on Begging Call Structure in Zebra Finches (Taeniopygia
guttata): Evidence of Early Vocal Plasticity.” We have entirely redone the statistics
according to the third reviewer’s suggestions. We are grateful the editor allowed us to
interact with this reviewer who aggreed to help us improving the statistics of the
manuscript. In this new version, we took into account all the reviewer’s concerns and
none of our conclusions were changed by the new statistical approach. The third
reviewer’s advice were essential to update our statistical methods and strengthen our
results. Based on the reviewer’s comments, we also streamlined our results section,
and we think the manuscript has been much improved. The two other reviewers both
found the manuscript already greatly improved by the first round of corrections and
only had minor comments. We responded to all of them.

Comments to the Author(s)
The revisions have greatly improved the paper. In particular, the design and statistics
are much clearer to me, and the overall predictions and discussion were much
improved in response to suggestions by the other reviewer.
The manuscript should be improved still further through copy editing for standard
English usage throughout.
A native English speaker has edited this new version of the manuscript.
A couple of minor comments:
l. 55 Change "seems" to "is"?
The word has been changed
l. 77-79 I would be more explicit about what it would mean; the previous paragraph
offered some ideas.
We removed this sentence since this sentence was not clear and we go back to the
implications of the results in the discussion.
l. 97-98 There’s been enough papers published on hunger and begging calls in various
species that I would base the predictions on them, as the previous sentence did, rather
than rely on Morton’s (1977) motivation-structural "rules".
There is to our knowledge no published study that directly tested the effect of
physiological stress on begging call structure as reviewed in [1], we separately
addressed the predictions related to hunger (lines 101-103), we would like to keep
here a prediction related to physiological stress. To add a more recent reference, we
added the work of Perez et al (2012) who showed in adult zebra finches that high
corticosterone levels shift calls’ spectrum to higher frequency bands.

134 looking at your table 2 the difference between BF and ZF nests seems slightly
larger, when I calculated the means I got slightly different means: BF=2.75 and ZF =
2.33 which is an almost 20% difference in brood size? (but perhaps I made a mistake,
please double-check)
The data were checked and calculations were redone. Our mistake was that our
previous calculation included extra nests not included in the study. The actual brood
sizes are 2.82 for ZFR and 3.13 for BFR, thus an almost 10% difference which was not
statistically different (W = 32, p-value = 0.2189). See line130.
142-144 the way you calculated and presented these numbers here it looks as if the
correct term here would be relative proportion? (a ratio is something like 3:1)
The wording has been changed, line 137.
385 perhaps better replace ‘striking’ with ‘pronounced’?
The adjective has been changed, line 298 and 344.
407 ‘noisy’ is perhaps not precise enough in this context as it can refer to the sound
structure or the amplitude?
A sentence has been added to clarify this point: “The spectral noisyness of the signal
was also lower », line 366
415 how do we know from this experiment that this is what stimulates parents best?
Unless I missed something, I think this is still a hypothesis at this stage?
The wording has been changed. “Taken together, all these results are in favour of the
hypothesis that chicks converged with Bengalese finch begging calls. This would be
consistent with the reinforcement learning hypothesis, chicks homing in on what stimulates
parents best », line 372
479/80 this statement should be toned down- your study shows a change but the
experiment/data are not conclusive with respect to the mechanism underlying the
change.
This sentence has been changed, line 442.

Comments to the Author(s)
General Comments (focused on statistical issues)
This manuscript presents an analysis of how begging call parameters of zebra finch
nestlings are influenced by cross-fostering them by another species. The key methods
used are Principal Components Analyses (PCA) and Mixed models (GLMM). The
authors correctly identified Mixed Model as s tool control for pseudo-replication, and
also the use of PCA to remove redundancy in among the acoustic measures appreciable.
However, the main GLMM is somewhat miss-specified (with regard to the fixed and
random effects included) and the approach used for testing is outdated. I also was a
little confused about the details of implementation of the PCA. Finally, in my opinion,
the testing and corresponding presentation of the results could be streamlined and
shortened.
We greatly appreciated your statistical advice and, after several steps of discussion
with you, we think we answered all your requests. The corrections we made are in the
two “statistical analysis” paragraphs describing each analysis (for the begging call
structure analysis, see from line 183 to 251 and for chicks body condition analysis, see
from line 265 to 277).
My main concerns are detailed as follows:
PCA: the use of two Principal Components Analyses (L 205-211 & 248-258) is
somewhat confusing and I wonder whether this could be streamlined (or was only one
PCA used? This is somewhat confusing).
We used a first PCA on acoustic parameters to describe our data set and define outlier
calls. We defined threshold values of [-3*SD, +3*SD] on each of the 4 PC axes, and then
removed the calls outside these values from the data set. This method was set to
eliminate only calls being outliers on several acoustic parameters (because they were
outliers based on a PCA). The main purpose was to reach Gaussian/symetric
distributions of our data set on acoustic parameters before running a second PCA to
analyse the effect of our treatment. The second PCA was thus run on the remaining data
set to analyse the effect of our treatment on the acoustic structure of the calls.
Because this was confusing, we will re-run our analysis on the complete data set and
present the corresponding results.
Comment reviewer: perhaps it is certainly a good idea to worry about the
distributions of the variables before entering them into a PCA. However, I would first
try to transform them, which, as they are acoustic parameters, seems quite promising
to me.
Answer authors: We now include all the data set in the PCA analysis.
With regard to the second PCA I also was surprised to see that only 'non-redundant'
parameters (L 253) were included.
We now include all parameters showing a symmetrical distribution (after
transformation if necessary), see line 201.
Comment reviewer: okay.
Isn't it the very purpose of PCA to remove redundancy from the set of parameters?
We now include all parameters showing a symmetrical distribution (after
transformation if necessary), see line 200.
Comment reviewer: okay.
Also, PCA as a parametric method may suffer from skewed distributions of the
parameters included, and I think it is a good idea to inspect these for deviations from
normality/symmetry/absence of outliers and transform variables in case needed
before including them into the PCA.
We now make this clear, see line 200.
Comment reviewer: see above.
The total variance explained by the principal components retained should be
mentioned in the main text.
This was presented in ESM table 3. We now added it to the main document, see line
204.
Comment reviewer: good.
GLMM for acoustic parameters as response:
- intra-brood sex ratio is a quantity and as such should not at all be included as a
random effect but as a fixed effect; the same applies body condition index (BCI; L 229-
232).
Intra-brood was reasonably interpretable as a categorical variable, as it showed only 5
different values for 20 broods, but we agree this was an error for BCI. Both of them are
included as fixed factors, see below.
Comment reviewer: well, even if intra-brood sex ratio has only five different values it
still is most probably better to include it as a fixed effect. The reason is random effects
with few levels are hard to model which can lead to considerable problems (think of a
predictor like sex, which has only two different values and still would always enter a
mixed model as a fixed effect). So I would definitely let it be a fixed effect.
Answer authors: We now include intra-brood sex ratio and BCI as fixed effects, see full
model line 215.
- since obviously several calls per recording session are included into the analysis (L
240) session ID (which needs to have a unique label for each combination of subject ID
and age) needs to be included as a further random effect.
We now do it.
Comment reviewer: great.
See full model line 2015.
- the hunger level or stress of the chicks might increase during the recording sessions.
Hence, a further fixed effect of call number within session should be included (and it
might be worth considering the inclusion of interaction between call number and, e.g.,
age).
We include the call index as fixed factor, see full model line 215 and illustrate its effect
on PCs in ESM figure ESM 2, line 34 of the ESM.
Comment reviewer: great.
- it is true that MCMC (pvals.fnc) was considered to reveal the most reliable P-values
until recently. However, after the papers by Schielzeth & Forstmeier (2009) and Barr et
al. (2013) we know better.
We changed all the statistical approach to be consistent with the current line of
procedure regarding linear models and according to your advice.
- In fact, in order to keep type I error rate close to the nominal level of 0.05 the model
needs to include random slopes of age, sex and, BCI within subject, nest of origin, and
foster nest.
We did it, see full model line 215.
- Most reliable P-values for fixed effects are then obtained by comparing the full model
with reduced models lacking the fixed effects one at a time (R function drop1).
Answer authors to reviewer: We understand your point, we now precise the actual
number of observations, without any missing values, and we use R function drop1 as
requested.
- So I feel the appropriate model would be (in lmer annotation and including also the
correlations between the random intercepts and slopes components):
acoustic parameter ~ group*sex*age + call number + intra-brood sex ratio + BCI + (1 +
age + BCI|subject) + (1+ group + sex + age + intra-brood sex ratio + BCI|nest of origin) +
(1 + sex + age + BCI|foster nest) + (1|session ID)
and without the correlations between the random intercepts and slopes components
included the model would be
acoustic parameter ~ group*sex*age + call number + intra-brood sex ratio + BCI +
(1|subject) + (1|nest of origin) + (1|foster nest) + (0 + sex|nest of origin) + (0 +
sex|foster nest) + (0 + group|nest of origin) + (0 + age|subject) + (0 + age|nest of origin)
+ (0 + age|foster nest) + (0 + intra-brood sex ratio|nest of origin) + (0 + BCI|subject) +
(0 + BCI|nest of origin) + (0 + BCI|foster nest) + (1|session ID)
(no warranty of correct- and completeness for these formulae). Note that the latter
model is way simpler although it looks more complex.
Question authors to reviewer: Because BCI was measured only once per individual
(at only one age), we do not understand why you think it should be included as a
random slope for the random intercept “subject”, i.e. (1 + age + BCI|subject). Could you
explain? From our understanding of the paper Schielzeth & Forstmeier 2009 Behav
Ecol, we would instead define this random factor as (1 + age|subject).
Comment reviewer to authors: if BCI was measured only once per individual it
certainly is impossible to include a random slope of BCI within individual, so just drop
this term (I wasn't aware of that when writing my comments).
Answer authors to reviewer: This was our understanding. So we now include BCI as a
fixed factor only, see full model line 215.
Note also that I recommend to manually dummy code sex and group before including
them as random slopes components.
We indeed dummy coded sex and group and include them in random slopes. We also Z-
transformed Age, call index and intra-brood sex ratio. This model runs fine and
converges.
Finally note that it might be needed to also include the (two- or three-way) interactions
as random slopes whether this is required/possible depends on the amount of
variation of the respective terms within the levels of the random factors.
Question authors to reviewer: we are afraid we do not know how to decide on this
point: what is the amount of variation that requires to include these two- or three-way
interactions?
Comment reviewer to authors: one way to decide whether a random slope of an
interaction within a given random effect can be included is to construct variables
representing the terms fitted for the interaction (e.g., int.sec.age=sexM*age
representing two-way interaction between sex and age), then cross-tabulating these
variables with the random effects, one at a time (e.g., c.tab=table(nest of origin,
int.sec.age)) and then checking how many different values the variable has per level of
the random effect (e.g., apply(xx>0, 1, sum) or, more condensed table(apply(xx>0, 1,
sum))). If you see many (or only) 1s then the random slope cannot be fitted, itherwise it
can…
Question authors to reviewer: Thank you for this detailed explanation. We evaluated
the relevance of integrating covariate interaction in the random slope. The method you
proposed led us to the following model:
model <- lmer(PC1 ~ cond*ZAGE* Sex + Zcall number + Z intra-brood sex ratio + ZBCI +
(1 + ZAGE |subject) + (1 + sexF + groupFR +ZAGE+ int.sexF.ZAGE| Nest of Origin) + (1
+ sexF +ZAGE + int.sexF.groupFR + int.sexF.ZAGE | Foster nest) + (1| sessionID),
data=completeDATA)
where :
- int.sexF.ZAGE = sexF*ZAGE
- int.sexF.groupFR= sexF*groupFR
Unfortunetly, running this model led to one warning :
# Warning message:
# In commonArgs(par, fn, control, environment()) :
# maxfun < 10 * length(par)^2 is not recommended.
Despite this warning message the drop1 function worked and output the same results
as without the covariate interaction terms added in the random slope. We would think
about keeping the model without them, as it runs without any trouble. Any suggestion?
Answer reviewer to authors: yes. Although the warning doesn't seem deadly you
should perhaps simplify the model by removing the correlations between the random
intercepts and slopes (Barr et al. 2013 showed that neglecting them does not lead to
inflated type I error rates). This model would look as follows:
model <- lmer(PC1 ~ cond*ZAGE* Sex + Zcall number + Z intra-brood sex ratio + ZBCI +
(1|subject)+ (0 + ZAGE |subject) + (1|Nest of Origin) + (0+sexF|Nest of Origin) +
(0+groupFR|Nest of Origin) +(0+ZAGE|Nest of Origin)+ (0+int.sexF.ZAGE| Nest of
Origin) + (1|Foster nest) + (0+sexF|Foster nest) + (0+ZAGE|Foster nest) +
(0+int.sexF.groupFR|Foster nest) + (0+int.sexF.ZAGE|Foster nest) + (1| sessionID),
data=completeDATA)
although this model looks more complex it is actually way simpler (as you can see
forom the random effects part of the output)
Answers authors to reviewer: We run the model you proposed and it worked perfectly
fine. We used the function you provided us to check the validity of the models we run
and all models are validated according the output of your function.
- in the literature about mixed models balancing is not considered an issue, and, hence,
I do not really see a need for the repeated random selection of calls and averaging of
the results (L 240-247). Instead, I would just run one model based on all available calls.
We now do it.
Comment reviewer to authors: okay.
GLMM for body condition index (BCI) as response:
Similar to the above GLMM also this model is somewhat miss-specified. In fact, it lacks
the random slopes of age within origin and foster nest
Question authors to reviewer: Thanks again. We removed the obvious redundancies.
We tried to run the model you proposed, unfortunately, the number of observations we
have do not allow us to run it: too many random factors compared to the number of
observations (N=51 chicks).
Contrary to the analysis of acoustic parameters, the BCI was measured only once at
day=14(+-1) of each chick. By using ‘day’ as a factor, we just wanted to control for the
variability of the day of measurement, but we did not repeat the measure for a given
chick. Re-thinking about the relevance of adding random slopes of covariates, we
decided that ‘day’ might not be relevant as a random slope. Beside, we thought the
triple interaction with this factor was not the most relevant explanatory variable, we
decided to put ‘day’ factor as an additional fixed factor with no interaction term.
Moreover, as the variability in the day of measurement is the same in both
experimental groups, we may be able to completely remove this factor from the model,
what do you think?
Considering the number of observations we have, it seems that we can include only one
random slope in the model. Because the sex of the chicks has a well-known effect on
growth [2] we decided to choose this factor and added the term ‘sexF’ as dummy coded
random slope. The resulting model would be:
modelBCI=lmer(BCI~group+sex+Zday_14+Zsex_ratio+ group:sex +(1+sexF |foster
nest)+(1+sexF | nest of origin)
We ran the influence function on this model, but certainly because the number of levels
of the random factor ‘Nest of origin’ is relatively small (20), the function found 6
influent levels. This function might not be adapted here, what do you think?
Answer reviewer: this is tricky because I am not really aware anymore of what the
model aimed at…in any case it seems like a pretty complex model for just 51 data
points. I'd first think about the set of fixed effects: are they all needed? I myself wonder
why you do have the sex ratio and the interaction between group and sex in there as I
don't really see a biological reason for them to be included (but this might solely due to
my ignorance. Then I'd consider the question, which the key predictors in this model
are. To me this seems to be group (i.e., whether they are fostered by con- or hetero-
specifics). Given that I'd tentatively consider the random slopes of group to be the most
important ones (but this really is a very tentative suggestion). In any case you could
remove the correlations between random slopes and intercepts (as shown above).
Answer authors to reviewer: we decided to run this model:
modelBCI <- lmer(BCI values~Group*Sex+Age at measurement+ ZIntra-brood sex-ratio
+ +(0+groupFR |Foster Nest)+(0+GroupFR | Nest of Origin)+(0+sexF |Foster
Nest)+(0+sexF | Nest of Origin). Taking into acount the the cross-fostering treatment
and potential effect of the sex on growth of the chicks, pointed out by another reviewer
and it worked fine. We additionally used the function you provided us to check the
validity of this model and it was validated according the output of your function.
I also did not understand why the model was simplified (L 265-269) not is it clear what
the original full model was. This bears similarity with stepwise procedures and
inappropriate use of model selection both of which has been shown to come along with
severe problems (Whittingham et al. 2006; Mundry R & Nunn CL. 2009; Mundry 2011).
Here, the authors should specify the full model tested and report the corresponding
results.
We will do it.
Comment: great.
Both GLMMs:
It has been recently shown that inspecting the significance of individual predictors but
not the significance of the full model can lead to greatly inflated type I error rates
(Forstmeier & Schielzeth 2011). Hence, the authors should conduct and report such
full-null model comparisons. Note that the null model should comprise the same
random effects structure of the full model and also may comprise fixed effects not being
in the focus of the investigation (e.g., condition index in the first GLMM).
We will do it. But as said above, the drop1 function cannot be used on a data set
containing NA. Any advice?
Comment reviewer: great (see above).
We removed missing values and write the actual size of the data in the main document.
We decided to remove the analysis of the Inter-call Interval, as it would have removed
one third of the data.
Results (L284-343):
I feel this section could be streamlined and shortened considerably. It also suffers from
quite heavy multiple testing. In detail: I do not really understand why the authors use
PCA to remove redundancy among the acoustic parameters but then test each of them
individually. In fact, assuming the principal components derived capture a sufficient
amount of variation on the acoustic parameters and the loadings of the acoustic
parameters on them reveal interpretable principal components,
the GLMM could be run on the few principal components rather than all the acoustic
parameters (and results of GLMMs for the latter could be moved to the electronic
appendix). This would streamline this section considerably and also clearly alleviate
the otherwise heavy multiple testing issue.
In the previous round of review, reviewer 2 asked that we show the tests of each
parameter individually (‘I feel that by presenting only the PC1 scores rather than
specifically testing parameters we know to be affected in different situation, the data have
not been used to the full’). So we decided to present both the test on the 1st principal
component of the PCA as well as individual parameters, so the reader has the entire
picture. But we can of course present only the PCA in the main text, and move the tests
on acoustic parameters in the appendix.
Comment reviewer: I'd go for the latter option (but probably the editor will also have
to speak a word about that).
We chose this option and present only results of the multivariate analysis in the main
document. The analysis of each parameter is now available in the ESM. We specified
this point in the results section.
Specific comments
L 219: it is not the data that need to be normally distributed but the residuals.
We now precise that we checked the residuals,
Comment reviewer: good.
See line 191.
L 135 & 144: I guess these were Mann-Whitney U tests; should be explicitly stated.
Indeed, this is a Mann-Whitney U test, but the function to run it in R is named
‘wilcox.test’.
Comment reviewer: good.
In this last version, we did not need to use non-parametric tests since all models were
validated. See model line 267.
Also sample sizes should be indicated.
They are presented in the appendix. See tables ESM 1 and EMS3.
L 154-156: I wonder whether linear regression is appropriate. Although not being an
expert in nestling growth, my intuition is that a non-linear model might be more
appropriate.
Using the residuals from a regression of body mass on a linear measure of body size is
one of the most common methods of measuring condition in many vertebrates taxa
(see SCHULTE-HOSTEDDE A.I. et al. Ecology, 86(1), 2005, pp. 155–163). This method
has indeed been much debated (see Green AJ Ecology, 82(5), 2001, pp. 1473–1483), but
it remains a legitimate index of body condition (see SCHULTE-HOSTEDDE A.I. et al.
Ecology, 86(1), 2005, pp. 155–163). This remains the method commonly used in the
literature on nestlings’ growth rate (see for instance in our study species: Martins,
T.L.F., 2004. Behavioral Ecology 15, 174-180).
Comment: okay.
L 205: I do not see how a PCA can be used to remove outliers (the help of the function
dudi.pca also doesn't say a word about removal of outliers).
Please see our answer above.
Comment: okay (and see also my comments above).
L 207. 'Eigenvalue' rather than 'eigen-value'.
We corrected the mistake. See line 206
L 215-217: perhaps worth mentioning here: in the context of Mixed Models one usually
checks for model stability/absence of influential cases by removing levels of the
random effects one at a time (see Nieuwenhuis et al. 2012 for details and for an R
package doing that).
The influence function worked on the model chosen. We were able to test for influential
subjects, none of them had influence on conclusions. We double-checked all the models
using the function you gave us and they were perfectly fine.
L 219: it is not the data that need to be normally distributed but the residuals of the
model(s).
We now precise that we checked the residuals.
Comment: good.
See line 191.
L 226: include the reference for lme4 (in R a call of 'citation("lme4")' reveals that).
Done, see line 207
L 234: note that whenever a three-way interaction is included in a model the respective
lower terms (two-way interactions and main effects) need to be included as well. In R
this can be most easily ensured by calling the model with the interaction specified as
group*sex*age.
This was exactly what we did.
Comment: good (and please state that explicitly in the paper; there are too many out
there for which we don't know whether the authors fitted appropriate models (and I
guess quite a proportion did not)).
We tried to be clear about this methodology, see line 248.
Note also that it might be a good idea to z-transform age before inclusion into an
interaction (see Schielzeth 2010 for details).
We will do it.
Comment: good.
L 240: indicate also the range of calls per subject per age.
L 245-246: I didn't understand this sentence.
L 253: include the reference for package ade4. How was it determined which
parameters were 'non redundant'?
Please see our answer above.
Comment: okay.
Electronic supplementary material:
Table 4: I would show standard errors of the estimates. Note also that P-values of main
effects and two-way interactions being included into a three-way interaction do have,
at best, a very limited interpretation, and hence I would not report them.
We removed them.
Comment: good.
We used the drop1 function, they do not appear anymore.
