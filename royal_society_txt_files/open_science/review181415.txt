This is a strong piece of work on an interesting topic (effects of face shape on attention in
macaques). I have only some minor suggestions.
1. The authors could cite this recent paper as a further null result for associations between
testosterone and facial masculinity in men https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40750-
017-0064-1
2. Similar to Deaner et al's pay per view finding, recent work has reported that humans also find
high dominance faces rewarding (even when controlling for attractiveness). This might be worth
mentioning.

This is a really interesting idea. It's really neat to see that macaques respond to differences in
facial sexual dimorphism. I'm not sure that it's as exciting as it sounds without relevant control
3
conditions. The problem is that the authors don't show that there effects are not low level. Every
picture differs in colour and shape, and so that a monkey can see different pixels isn't very
interesting. We know their effects aren't due to colour or luminance differences between groups
of pictures, but there are still differences in the arrangement of pixels, their colour values, and
their intensity in these pictures.
What we need to see to make sure this is relevant to the social lives of the animals, and to make
this have anything to do with the just-so stories of evolution in the intro and discussion are to
manipulate the faces on other dimensions irrelevant to the social lives of the animals to see if
looking at the differences in sexual dimorphism are at any higher level than just looking at
different arrangements of pixels. Other relevant controls could be turning the pictures upside
down and see if they still see the differences, or invert colour values. Anything to show that it
isn't low level would work.
The box and scatter plots do not instill confidence in these findings. For the scatter plot, you can't
see any line on the graph except the one that the authors drew themselves. The boxplots are
indistinguishable. You cannot see a difference in the means or the error. So many points are
outside of the confidence intervals in the scatter plot and outside both boxes in the box plot, that
it just doesn't look like any real effects. Imagine what the public would think if they saw these
graphs! They would never believe you that there was any difference in looking time. Just
because a stats test shows a significant difference, doesn't mean that that difference means
anything.
When analyzed, the authors show that these effects are really weak, and they rely on
nonparametrics stats because the data are not normal. The p-values meet the 0.05 cutoff, but I
don't think these effects are strong enough to place strong value on, and are unlikely to replicate.
The APS rules on statistics reporting state that when effects are weak, only those findings that
over-exaggerate a true relationship can be significant. I'm concerned that is what happened here.

Subject Editor Comments to Author:
This study tests whether female macaques recognize male faces as male faces, and whether they
respond differentially to faces of males that are more or less "masculine." They find that females
will look longer at a more "masculine" male when the contrast between the two males they are
shown is higher in "masculinity." They hypothesize that either potential threat or potential
mating interest may explain the longer look times, but they do not test these ideas.
The authors report the data that they find statistically significant (predictably, I would say,
although the expression of significance appears weak) simply as contrasts between two photos of
males. But we have no absolute quantification of how "masculine" each of those images are, even
though the authors provide a good figure of the features they consider "masculine." Rather than
reporting the data simply as pairwise differences, I think the authors should provide some kind
of quantification of the images used and of the pairwise differences in masculinity, plotted
against look time.
In other words, let's say you quantified images with masculinity of features on a scale of 1 to 5,
with 5 the highest. Are there differences in look time between using a pair of 5 and 3 compared to
3 and 1? The quantitative difference is the same but the absolute degree of masculinity is not.
The authors might have used pictures of various males in threat display (grinning or whatever)
contrasted with either other males in threat display or not in threat display, with the degree of
masculinity varying. That might help determine how threat display might play in.
Overall I think this study does not have much of a conclusion, and it presents little more than raw
5
data with statistically significant but causally unconvincing patterns. I would like to see a bit
more analysis of the available data to see if hypotheses can be tested and inferences cleared up. If
you decide to resubmit, which would be welcome, please be sure to address all these comments
plus those of the reviewers. Best of luck.

I disagreed with the editor's and reviewer's comments suggesting that this is an uninformative

robust across analyses. I agree with the authors that including additional conditions (e.g. threat

is fair and, importantly, takes into account the strength of their evidence. It troubles me that we
still read reviews suggesting that a paper not be published because the data aren't necessarily

The authors have done a great job addressing my previous comments, and I agree with most of
their sentiment. I think the authors got the wrong idea about what I was trying to say. I agree
that while the effects are weak, no manuscript should ever be rejected based on the effect size or
p-value, including this one. However, my real issue is that I think the manuscript over-interprets
the results, and I don't think that has really been addressed.
We stand at a precipice in evolutionary psychology research, learning that hormones have little
effect on facial appearance and mate preferences. The introduction and discussion are essentially
that same evolutionary psychology haphazardly applied to monkeys. For example, the authors
cite Folstad and Karter with reference to immunocompetence and the handicap hypothesis, but
nobody has tested if the facial masculinity manipulated in this experiment is at all related to the
expression of testosterone in Macaques. The authors provide no direct evidence as to whether
testosterone actually has immunosupressive effects in Macaques, or whether this facial feature is
used causally in mate choice and/or intrasexual competition. It's entirely possible that none of
this is true, and the authors picked a manipulation that has no ecological validity in their species,
but is detectable given the demand characteristics of the experiment. It's a weak finding and a
strong interpretation. I would recommend rethinking this. It's proven a dangerous combination
in human evolutionary psychology.
In summary, as you can see from my discussion points above, I think that the article is very
interesting and should generate future work in this area. If I'm discussing it this much in peer
review, I can only imagine it generating this much interest for other researchers. Therefore, I
recommend publication.

Appendix A
Dear Editors,
Please find attached our resubmission of the paper titled Experimental evidence that
female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) perceive variation in male facial
masculinity. We are grateful for the constructive comments of the Editor and the
Reviewers, and feel that they have improved the manuscript substantially. We here
outline the changes we have made in response to these comments. We give our
responses in bold, and line numbers as in the revised MS.
Subject Editors Comments to Author:
This study tests whether female macaques recognize male faces as male faces, and
whether they respond differentially to faces of males that are more or less
"masculine." They find that females will look longer at a more "masculine" male when
the contrast between the two males they are shown is higher in "masculinity." They
hypothesize that either potential threat or potential mating interest may explain the
longer look times, but they do not test these ideas.
The authors report the data that they find statistically significant (predictably, I would
say, although the expression of significance appears weak) simply as contrasts
between two photos of males. But we have no absolute quantification of how
"masculine" each of those images are, even though the authors provide a good figure
of the features they consider "masculine." Rather than reporting the data simply as
pairwise differences, I think the authors should provide some kind of quantification of
the images used and of the pairwise differences in masculinity, plotted against look
time. In other words, let's say you quantified images with masculinity of features on a
scale of 1 to 5, with 5 the highest. Are there differences in look time between using a
pair of 5 and 3 compared to 3 and 1? The quantitative difference is the same but the
absolute degree of masculinity is not.
Response: We have added an additional analysis to the manuscript, to explore
the potential importance of absolute masculinity. In this new analysis, the
percentage time spent looking at the masculine image is entered as the
dependent variable, and both the relative difference in masculinity of the two
images and the absolute masculinity score of the more masculine image are
entered as predictors (please see lines 239-241). The Variance Inflation Factor
is 1.49, indicating that collinearity is not a substantial problem in such an
analysis. The effect of the relative difference in masculinity remains significant
in this model, and there is no significant effect of the absolute score of the
more masculine image (please see lines 269-273). This result indicates that the
effect of relative masculinity differences is independent of absolute masculinity
scores.
The authors might have used pictures of various males in threat display (grinning or
whatever) contrasted with either other males in threat display or not in threat display,
with the degree of masculinity varying. That might help determine how threat display
might play in.
Response: We chose to include only images of males displaying a neutral
facial expression, specifically to avoid potential confounds related to facial
expression. We now make this important criterion for stimulus image selection
clear in the Methods (please see lines 151-153).
Overall I think this study does not have much of a conclusion, and it presents little
more than raw data with statistically significant but causally unconvincing patterns. I
would like to see a bit more analysis of the available data to see if hypotheses can be
tested and inferences cleared up. If you decide to resubmit, which would be
welcome, please be sure to address all these comments plus those of the reviewers.
Best of luck.
Response: Our study provides evidence from a non-human species that
variation in male facial shape, specifically variation along a feminine-masculine
continuum, is salient to female conspecifics. This is a crucial first step in
investigating whether this trait may have been shaped by sexual selection on
the basis of female choice and/or male-male competition for mates. Testing
these latter ideas was beyond the scope of our study but we hope that the
publication of our findings will inspire future studies. In the Discussion, we
now clearly highlight the fact that our study did not attempt to disentangle the
potential reasons for the visual biases we observed, and we detail the future
work that could be done to explicitly test ideas about the role of sexual
selection in driving male facial masculinity (please see lines 348-353).
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
This is a strong piece of work on an interesting topic (effects of face shape on
attention in macaques). I have only some minor suggestions.
The authors could cite this recent paper as a further null result for associations
between testosterone and facial masculinity in men
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40750-017-0064-1
Response: The suggested reference does not explore facial masculinity per se,
and so we have chosen not to cite it. Instead, we have now added a reference
to Pound et al. (2009), who explored directly the link between basal
testosterone levels and facial masculinity, and found no relationship between
them, but found a link between testosterone reactivity and facial masculinity,
and Bird et al. 2016, who found no link between either baseline testosterone or
testosterone reactivity, and facial masculinity (please see lines 58-61, 312).
Similar to Deaner et al's pay per view finding, recent work has reported that humans
also find high dominance faces rewarding (even when controlling for attractiveness).
This might be worth mentioning.

Reviewer: 2
This is a really interesting idea. It's really neat to see that macaques respond to
differences in facial sexual dimorphism. I'm not sure that it's as exciting as it sounds
without relevant control conditions. The problem is that the authors don't show that
there effects are not low level. Every picture differs in colour and shape, and so that
a monkey can see different pixels isn't very interesting. We know their effects aren't
due to colour or luminance differences between groups of pictures, but there are still
differences in the arrangement of pixels, their colour values, and their intensity in
these pictures.
What we need to see to make sure this is relevant to the social lives of the animals,
and to make this have anything to do with the just-so stories of evolution in the intro
and discussion are to manipulate the faces on other dimensions irrelevant to the
social lives of the animals to see if looking at the differences in sexual dimorphism
are at any higher level than just looking at different arrangements of pixels. Other
relevant controls could be turning the pictures upside down and see if they still see
the differences, or invert colour values. Anything to show that it isn't low level would
work
Response: Many looking-time experiments have taken place using conspecific
primate faces, and other types of stimuli, from neutral stimuli such as shells, to
heterospecific primate faces. These studies, represented by many publications,
have demonstrated that primates show a strong conspecific face bias (Fujita,
K. Primates (1987) 28, 353-366. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02381018; Demaria, C.
& Thierry, B. Primates (1988) 29, 237-244. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02381125

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.08.003 l please see lines 93-96).
They have also demonstrated that among conspecific faces, primates have
preferences for the most socio-sexually relevant stimuli (e.g. Deaner et al.
2005; Higham et al. 2011). As such, a looking-time preference for variation in
conspecific primate faces ahead of other types of stimuli, including novel
stimuli, is already well-established, especially in rhesus macaques. Our
stimulus set consisted of 10 masculine and 10 feminine images, for a total of
100 combinations; we consider it extremely unlikely that some unmeasured
feature is systematically related to males facial masculinity that is not linked to
facial masculinity. Regarding the suggestion that low level visual preference
effects causes the results seen here, we would interpret this as being the
perceptual mechanism that leads towards preferences for more sexually-
dimorphic faces. We therefore consider this as a possibility in the Discussion
(please see lines 342-347).
The box and scatter plots do not instill confidence in these findings. For the scatter
plot, you can't see any line on the graph except the one that the authors drew
themselves. The boxplots are indistinguishable. You cannot see a difference in the
means or the error. So many points are outside of the confidence intervals in the
scatter plot and outside both boxes in the box plot that it just doesn't look like any real
effects. Imagine what the public would think if they saw these graphs! They would
never believe you that there was any difference in looking time. Just because a stats
test shows a significant difference, doesn't mean that that difference means anything.
Response: The box and scatter plots simply show all of our data; we chose to
include all of the data points overlaying the boxplots in the spirit of full
transparency. We agree that the differences/relationships depicted in our
figures appear to be relatively weak, but this is consistent with the nature of
such results. The line in the scatterplot (Figure 4) was not drawn on by the
authors; it is the line of best fit for the data and was automatically added by the
R package used to create the figure. The confidence interval on the scatterplot
is the 95% confidence interval of the regression line, not of the data points (as
we now clarify in the caption of Figure 4), so it is absolutely expected that
many data points fall outside this interval. We have clarified the meaning of the
shaded area in figure 4s caption. Lastly, the boxes in the boxplots (Figures 3
and 5) represent the 1st and 3rd quartiles of the data, and, by definition, 50% of
the data points must fall outside of them.
When analyzed, the authors show that these effects are really weak, and they rely on
nonparametrics stats because the data are not normal. The p-values meet the 0.05
cutoff, but I don't think these effects are strong enough to place strong value on, and
are unlikely to replicate. The APS rules on statistics reporting state that when effects
are weak, only those findings that over-exaggerate a true relationship can be
significant. I'm concerned that is what happened here.
Response: We performed a rigorous experimental protocol and conducted only
the necessary statistical tests, to avoid problems with researcher degrees of
freedom, multiple testing, and/or p-hacking. Our results support our
hypotheses, with statistically significant relationships in the predicted
directions. Masculinity is only one feature out of many that could affect rhesus
macaques looking-behavior towards conspecific faces, and we did not
anticipate finding a very large effect. We now report the proportion of variance
in looking-time explained by differences in facial masculinity (please see line
267) and report the effect size (d=0.54) for the significant difference in looking
time that we found (please see line 284). Our effects are small to moderate, but
only by publishing these results will our colleagues be able to interpret them
for themselves, and we very much hope that future attempts will be made at
replication. Further, we would argue that such results should be published
even if they are not significant. Only by the open publication of studies
regardless of their outcome can we fully assess the evidence in favor or
against a hypothesis. We would be equally pleased to see failed or successful
replications, as we are interested in the truth regarding this phenomenon,
regardless of which hypothesis is supported.
