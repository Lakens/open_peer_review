In their study entitled "Mapping movement, mood, motivation, and mentation in the subthalamic
nucleus", Gourisankar et al. report very interesting findings of the relationship between DBS
stimulation site and clinical outcome in STN-DBS for Parkinson's Disease.
Their seminal study published in 2013 (Eisenstein, AoN) had a similar approach and reported
similar findings, but the improved design and increased case number as well as extended clinical
measures make the present followup study another significant contribution to the field.
Although there have been various studies about optimal stimulation sites in the field, the current
study design and methodological approach is insightful with key improvements including
standardized stimulation parameters, unilateral stimulation and robust statistical tests (as
introduced and validated in the Eisenstein study).
Especially the valence and anxiety results are novel and the motor effects robustly show a
divergence between dorsal STN for rigidity and zona incerta for resting tremor.
I only have a few remarks that could potentially help to further improve the study before
publication:
- Although data was co-registered to a commonly available stereotactic atlas (Mai & Paxinos),
results of the study (like peak coordinates or volumetric maps) would be much more transferable
and easy to prospectively validate if reported in MNI (e.g. 2009b high resolution NLIN ASYM)
space. I wonder how much work it would be to also prepare (and publicly share) the heatmaps in
MNI space? IMHO these would represent a major contribution to the field.
So far, only .txt files of contact locations are shared but nifti files of statistical analyses are spared.
- Results are convincing already, but would be even more convincing if especially the differential
effects (ventral vs. dorsal) could be validated e.g. in a leave-one-patient-out design (or similar
bootstrapping options). Could improvement of measures that showed a significant result
regarding stimulation site be significantly predicted in such a design based on the statistical
heatmaps? And e.g. could the tremor heatmap significantly better predict tremor outcome
compared to the bradykinesia map (and vice versa)? Showing such a double-differentiation
would make clear that these maps are not only significant but also i) specific to a certain
symptom and ii) potentially predictive for novel patients.

This manuscript by Gourisankar and colleagues was a pleasure to read and a welcomed follow-
up to Eisenstein et al., 2014 (Ann Neurol). This work addresses an important question in
optimizing DBS for Parkinson disease: what is the effect of DBS location in the STN on mood and
cognitive functioning, as well as motor symptoms? Overall, the study design is strong (i.e., within
subjects). The results provide a useful contribution to line of research that is clinically significant
but has yet to converge on a clear set of guidelines for care.
My enthusiasm would be further bolstered by additional interpretation of why results differ from
those presented in Eisenstein et al., 2014 (e.g., mood enhancement was associated with DBS to
dorsal not ventral STN), and why the results diverge across the two analyses (categorical and
3D). Type II error could be a possibility, as authors suggest (p.11), but that particular
interpretation limits the significance of the findings. Any other ideas? Can you quantify, for
example, the effect of standardized DBS location/settings compared to those determined through
the clinical programming process in Eisenstein et al., 2014?
Additional suggestions and inquiry, below:
Given known hemispheric specialization in affective function, as well as lateralized effects
reported in Eisenstein et al., (2014), it might be helpful to include DBS hemisphere in your
analysis. Could this account for an attenuation of effects in the mood and anxiety results?
A proposed strength of the design was to standardize parameters (e.g., 2.5 V), such that
stimulation was less biased (i.e., optimized) to target motor symptoms. Why then include 14
individuals with non-standard dose? Inclusion of these individuals could have attenuated the
effect on mood and cognitive measures, and also contradicts the proposition, somewhat.
Twice emphasized in the introduction was a rigorous control for multiple comparisons, which is
true for the 3D analysis but not for the univariate analysis, as far as I can tell. A more
conservative threshold for statistical significance would be prudent in Table 2, which likely
renders only one main effect of DBS site in the mood/motivation category (“valence”). Perhaps a
more parsimonious approach, also, would be a repeated measures ANOVA with one three level
factor (OFF/DORSAL/VENTRAL) and contrasts of interest, within. Either way, a measure of
effect size should be provided and discussed.
4
Repeated measurement of acute change in mood can be very challenging; the application of
visual analog scales (VAS) to assess valance, arousal, anxiety and apathy might be overstated in
the title and body text. One way to justify this approach would be to reference studies that
validate of these four scales for repeated measurement using VAS (in addition to those provided,
which make use of the strategy). Another idea would be to demonstrate some validation within
the current study: provide the instructions and VAS samples, provide descriptive statistics on
summary scores, conduct statistical assessment of order effects, consider more careful word
choice to describe the constructs represented by these various VAS measures - subjective self-
report vs clinician rating vs “better state” (p.9), for example - and perhaps note in the limitations
section that your cognitive and motor measures are probably stronger than your mood measures.

Dear Editor:
We appreciate the thoughtful input of both reviewers, and are happy to respond. We have gone well
beyond the “minor revision” requested (performed additional analyses, corrected errors discovered
in the course of doing those analyses, provided additional data), and we believe the new manuscript
is much improved. The key changes are these:
1. Reviewer 2 asked us to re-do the analysis with the subjects who couldn’t tolerate 2.5V.
Results of that analysis now appear in the attached Supplementary Info file, but don’t change
the conclusions substantially.
2. We discovered an error that basically had eliminated a handful of subjects from the analysis.
We corrected the error, but as a result of that change, the 3D analysis for affective valence is
no longer statistically significant, and that changes the abstract and conclusions. Related to
this error, Figure 1 now looks much more balanced left-right.
3. We discovered that what we had called “bradykinesia” in the previous version was not what
we said it was but was actually the single UPDRS item “body bradykinesia and hypokinesia.”
So we added a real bradykinesia score, which is now what we said it was before (sum of
contralateral finger taps, hand movements, rapid alternating movements of hands, and leg
agility scores). We left the body item in the paper, too.
4. We discovered that rigidity was actually improved more by ventral STN than by dorsal STN
stimulation, rather than the opposite (at one stage a negative vs. positive sign error had crept
in). That changes the abstract and conclusions.
Below we address the specific concerns raised by the reviewers.
Reviewer 1
“I wonder how much work it would be to also prepare (and publicly share) the heatmaps in MNI space? … So far,
only .txt files of contact locations are shared but nifti files of statistical analyses are spared.”
It turns out that it is nontrivial for us to calculate the coordinates in MNI space from Mai atlas
space.* However, we do now provide the NIFTI files for each statistical analysis.
* To visualize the DBS leads, we used 2D CT images that cover only part of the
brain (to minimize X-ray dose to the lens of the eye). The procedure used to

determine the z coordinate of the tip of the electrode and match that point to the
MRI was carefully validated, but mapping all that to MNI space would be time-
consuming. The Mai coordinates differ from Talairach & Tournoux coordinates
primarily in that the former use the center of the midline AC & PC, whereas T&T
use the upper border of AC and lower border of PC. The earlier T&T atlas also
scaled the brain by separate linear warps in each of 12 regions (e.g., for y, anterior to
AC, between AC and PC, and posterior to PC), but we did not.
esults are convincing already, but would be even more convincing if especially the differential effects (ventral vs.
sal) could be validated e.g. in a leave-one-patient-out design (or similar bootstrapping options). Could improvement
easures that showed a significant result regarding stimulation site be significantly predicted in such a design based
he statistical heatmaps?”
first emphasize that we did not make this claim in the paper; we believe our statistical method is
most appropriate and robust method available, but it does not allow one to be confident of a
diction from any one point in the p image used by our permutation analysis, much less from any
e point in the weighted mean or t images. The reviewer’s suggestion is fascinating, though, and in
ponse we did implement a leave-one-patient-out approach to test whether a modified weighted
an image made without one subject’s data predicted the change actually observed in each measure
he location of that subject’s active contacts (repeated for each subject). The prediction was
asured by Pearson correlation of the leave-one-patient-out predicted change at each subject’s
ntacts as the independent variable and the observed change at that subject’s contacts as the
pendent variable. The test was whether this procedure led to a significant positive correlation for
of the outcome measures tested. Disappointingly, none of them did, except for one item in the
sample stimulated at 2.5V only. For the tremor-at-rest item, the LOOCV correlation in this
sample was 0.197 (N=114, p=0.036), significant but not very useful. In the full sample (not
luding people stimulated at <2.5V), the LOOCV correlation was 0.1314 (N=140, p=0.12).
erefore there was no point going on to test whether (say) the tremor map did better at predicting
mor than at predicting bradykinesia, an interesting follow-on question from Prof. Horn. (The
hon script for this LOOCV analysis is available at github.com/BlackHershey/3Dstat-LOOCV.)

y enthusiasm would be further bolstered by additional interpretation of why results differ from those presented in

lts diverge across the two analyses (categorical and 3D). … Can you quantify, for example, the effect of
dardized DBS location/settings compared to those determined through the clinical programming process in
enstein et al., 2014?”
1) Why do the results differ from the 2014 paper? The most obvious reasons include that we studied
different groups of subjects, and we chose contacts for this study based on anatomical
imaging rather than by the clinical optimization process. Also, we did not claim in either
paper that one site was better than another, only that the location of stimulation mattered,
and that our best guess as to what sites were better may come from hot spots in the
statistical images.
2) Why do the 3D results differ from those of Table 2? We don’t know but can speculate as follows.
The statistical analysis is quite different. The categorical analysis essentially combines all
points close to the dorsal surface of the STN even though we expect that different sites near

the dorsal surface may have different results. By contrast, in the 3D analysis, which does
respect those spatial differences, we lose the potential boost to power gained by the paired
comparison.
3) Can we quantify the effect of standardized vs. clinically chosen DBS location and settings? Beyond the
differing results shown here, it is not clear how we could do that with these data. These
patients are (almost all) different from those reported in the 2014 paper. We believe that
answering this question definitively would require a new, within-subject study.
iven known hemispheric specialization in affective function, as well as lateralized effects reported in Eisenstein et
(2014), it might be helpful to include DBS hemisphere in your analysis. Could this account for an attenuation of
cts in the mood and anxiety results?” That is a very clever idea, and for this very reason we stimulated
th L & R STNs in a separate study not described here. But in this sample, we cannot compare
ectly since the study was not designed to do so; since patients with left-side-worse and right-side-
rse may differ, the comparison could only be qualitative. Furthermore, each such analysis (L-
rse patients vs. R-worse patients) would have only about half the number of subjects. We do
wever provide the data so that anyone who wishes can undertake such an analysis.
hy include the 14 individuals who could not tolerate the standard voltage?
e revised ms. includes a re-analysis leaving out those individuals, so that the stimulation
nditions are in fact uniform across subjects and across dorsal vs. ventral. Overall the results are
ite similar.
more conservative threshold for statistical significance would be prudent in Table 2, which likely renders only one
in effect of DBS site in the mood/motivation category (“valence”). Perhaps a more parsimonious approach, also,
uld be a repeated measures ANOVA with one three level factor (OFF/DORSAL/VENTRAL) and

epeated measurement of acute change in mood can be very challenging; the application of visual analog scales

tify this approach would be to reference studies that validate of these four scales for repeated measurement using
AS (in addition to those provided, which make use of the strategy). Another idea would be to demonstrate some

structs represented by these various VAS measures - subjective self-report vs clinician rating vs “better state” (p.9),
example - and perhaps note in the limitations section that your cognitive and motor measures are probably stronger
n your mood measures.”
e agree wholeheartedly that rating acute changes in mood is challenging, but we disagree in part
th the reviewer’s conclusions from that observation. There is no accepted gold standard, and in a
actical sense, we had few alternatives. Most clinical rating scales cover periods of time on the order
weeks, whereas we are rating mood over intervals of less than an hour. Furthermore, it was
portant to minimize the burden to the patient, and VAS scales take only a few seconds to
mplete. As noted in a very early application to major depression, “This technique allowed frequent
imation of the patient’s feeling state with minimal inconvenience to himself and to staff, and with
elihood of early detection of change in condition, and subsequent analysis of its significance. …

]o other technique can sample the patient’s mood frequently, simply and with such little distress,

is true that we did not use a single-item scale for mood ratings. We cited the Limsoontarakul
per because in it we defined the specific VAS anchor points we used, based on the circumplex
odel of emotion of Larsen and Diener, and the arithmetic transforms that reduced the individual
m scores to -1 to +1 scores for valence and arousal. The revised ms. makes this link to Larsen
d Diener explicit. We have also added selected references validating one-item VAS ratings of
ood and anxiety to clinical ratings. We can’t provide an exhaustive review; for instance, a 2012
per on assessment of anxiety at intervals less than 24 hours reviewed almost 200 prior studies. It
o concluded that “each of these four instruments [including the VAS] provides a reliable measure
capture rapid state-dependent variations in anxiety” (Rossi V, Pourtois G: Transient state-
pendent fluctuations in anxiety measured using STAI, POMS, PANAS or VAS: a comparative
iew. Anxiety Stress Coping 2012; 25:603-645.)
longer discussion of this point seems outside the scope of this response, and for that matter
obably of little interest to most readers. In the revised manuscript, we do highlight the limitations.
part of this comment, the reviewer may have been referring to the common interpretation of
ood as a lasting, pervasive emotional state. Sometimes this temporally-oriented definition is
ntrasted with affect, but in our view, “affect” refers to emotional expression (by countenance,
osody, and observable emotional behavior) rather than self-reported internal emotional state. We
tead are attempting to describe internal emotional state as reported by the patient, for which
ood” seems a very appropriate descriptor. In the methods section we now refer to what the
ASes rate as “self-rated current affective state.”
e now provide the instructions and anchor points for each VAS rating (in Supplementary
aterial).

etter state” was a poor choice of words and we have corrected that diction.
for the title, the glee derived from alliteration hopefully mitigates against any potential
thodological quibbles about how we rated mood (or “self-reported affective state”).
