In this manuscript, the authors modified PPP and characterized the PPP using different
techniques in detail. The prepared PPP was applied as adsorbent for the removal of U(VI) from
aqueous solutions under different conditions and discussed the results in detail. The contents are
important for the removal of U(VI) from aqueous solutions. After reading the manuscript, I think
it can be accepted for publication after revision.
Special comments:
1. For all the references, please add the journal names to each references. Also please edit the
names of the authors in the references.
2. Please separate the authors in author list.
3. In the Introduction, several critical reviews for the removal of U(VI) from aqueous soltuions
should be added in the revised form as this is important for readers in this area such as Chemical

In this manuscript, the authors prepared a chemically modified PPP by using Pomelo peel’s pulp
(PPP). The adsorbent has been characterized by using EDS, IR, BET and SEM. Also, UO22+
adsorption by the modified PPP was studied at different conditions such as pH, mass of
adsorbent, adsorption time, initial concentration, temperature, and so on. Moreover, its kinetic
and thermodynamic parameters were investigated. At the first reading the manuscript, it sounds
scientifically good to me, but there are various missing explanations and mistakes after a few
readings. Therefore, major revision is needed before the publication at Royal Society Open
Science. The authors must consider the following comments.
1- In lines between 17 and 27 on page 4, in the section of 2.Introduction, “Tao Dong et al. [18]
used barium metaphosphate as an adsorbent to study the adsorption properties of uranyl ions
under various conditions and the maximum adsorption capacity can reach 261.78 mg/g under
the optimal conditions; Zhang Zongbo et al [19] synthesized polyamino-containing ligands
modified ordered mesoporous materials with surface area 1052 cm2/g, and the adsorption of
uranium can reach 454 mg/g. Although the above studies obtain excellent results on adsorption
of uranyl ions, they have disadvantages about high costs and secondary pollution.”
You determined the adsorbed amount of uranyl ion by the modified PPP adsorbent as 42.733
mg/g. Tao Dong et al. found 6 times higher uranyl ion adsorption capacity, and Zhang Zongbo et
al found higher than 10 times. You claim that these studies have disadvantages about high costs
and secondary pollution. Did you calculate their costs and also your cost? You used various
materials and chemicals to obtain the modified PPP. Moreover, experiments were conducted at 50
<U+2103>. Also, what is secondary pollution that these studies have but your study does not have.
2- In lines between 11 and 15 on page 5, in the section of 4.2. BET, “According to the data in the
table, the BET surface area of the modified PPP is 36.733 m2/g, indicating the modified PPP
adsorbent with a large BET surface area which has potential adsorption properties for UO22+.”
How do you know that indicating the modified PPP adsorbent with a large BET surface area
which has potential adsorption properties for UO22+ only from Table 1? Also, is a BET surface
area of 36.733 m2/g high for you? What is your criterion to be a high BET surface area?
3- After line 60 on page 5, in the section of 4.5. IR, “… a distinct O—U characteristic peak
appeared at the wavenumber of 1383 cm-1.” The peak at 1383 cm-1 is already present at the
infrared spectrum of the modified PPP in Figure 4(a). You should give more clear explanations
for all the peaks, and you should cite all the peaks that were given in previous studies.
4- In lines between 27 and 32 on page 8, in the section of 4.6. Effect of pH, “When pH>5.0, as the
alkalinity of the solution increases, the hydroxide ion concentration in the solution continuously
increases, hydroxide ion and uranyl ions can form some ions with lower adsorption affinity …”
However, in Fig.10 whose caption is comparison of adsorption properties between modified and
unmodified PPP, the parameters are C0=35 mg/L,V=20 mL, T=50<U+2103>,m=10 mg, pH=6.0,t=90
min. Why did you adjust pH to 6.0? Also, readers would want to see uranyl ion adsorption by the
modified PPP at pH>7.0.
5- There are many papers related to the adsorption of uranium ions. Therefore, authors can add
the comparisons of uranium ion adsorption capacities by different adsorbents. Also, their costs
and efficiencies can be added.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The authors used the PPP as raw materials to prepare the adsorbent. The factors of different
adsorption conditions such as pH value, adsorption temperature, mass of adsorption time, and
initial concentration of UO22+ were investigated. This work has a certain innovation. However,
there are several imperfections in the manuscript and the experimental results haven’t presented
well. Therefore, a major revision should be finished in order to suitable for these journals, and the
detailed comments are as follows:
1. The introduction parts should re-write.
2. Page 7, line 10, the specific surface area, average pore diameters, and pore volume of the
unmodified PPP should be added in the Table 1.
3. Page 8, line 46, it can be seen that when the temperature is between 50-70 <U+2103>, the adsorption
performance of UO22+ is the best. Typically, in adsorption experiment, we may like to choose
room temperature. The author said the best temperature is 50-70 <U+2103>. Please give the reasons.
4. Page 9, line 3, with the increase of adsorbent dose, the adsorption amount decrease from 23.715
mg/g to 6.583 mg/g. Please give lots of experimental data to prove it.
5. Page 9, line 29, the adsorption of uranyl ions by modified PPP mainly takes place on the outer
surface and the inner surface of the sample. Please give the reasons.
6. Page 19, fig. 6 should be improved.
7. The authors should prove the recyclability of the absorbed by performing recycling
experiments
8. There exist some minor errors including spelling grammar and format for this paper.

The authors made a new chemical modified PPP from pomelo pulp (PPP) by fermentation,
cooking and freeze-drying. The adsorbent was characterized by means of SEM, IR, BET and EDS.
The effects of different adsorption conditions (pH, adsorption temperature, adsorbent quality,
adsorption time, initial concentration of UO2 2+) on the adsorbent performance were studied.
The experiment of this paper is feasible, but there is no obvious innovation. There are many
results and papers about similar modified adsorbents. The adsorption mechanism was discussed
but not enough. The optimum adsorption conditions obtained by the author are relatively
common, and there is no new knowledge about adsorption behavior. However, the PPP chosen
by the authors, as a waste, can be used for other purposes rather than simply adsorption. I
suggest that they have an in-depth understanding of the potential of this material and make full
use of it in a more appropriate place(or valuable products, such as chemicals)instead of using
complex steps to make water treatment adsorbents.

How do you know that indicating the modified PPP adsorbent with a large BET surface area

area of 36.733 m2/g high for you? What is your criterion to be a high BET surface area?
3- After line 60 on page 5, in the section of 4.5. IR, “… a distinct O—U characteristic peak
appeared at the wavenumber of 1383 cm-1.” The peak at 1383 cm-1 is already present at the

modified PPP at pH>7.0.
5- There are many papers related to the adsorption of uranium ions. Therefore, authors can add
the comparisons of uranium ion adsorption capacities by different adsorbents. Also, their costs

our manuscript, as well as the important guiding significance to our
researches. We have studied comments carefully and have made
correction which we hope meet with approval. Revised portion are
marked in red in the manuscript. The main corrections and the responds
to the reviewer’s comments are as flowing:
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer #1:

Also please edit the names of the authors in the references.
Response: Thank you for reading carefully. We have added the
information and marked them red in the revised manuscript.
2. Please separate the authors in author list.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have corrected the error
and marked them red in the revised manuscript.
3. In the Introduction, several critical reviews for the removal of U(VI)
from aqueous soltuions should be added in the revised form as this is
important for readers in this area such as Chemical Society Reviews.
2018, 4[1, 2]7, 2322-2356; Environmental Pollution. 2018, 240, 493-505;
Polymer Chemistry. 2018, 9, 3562-3582.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have added these critical
reviews and marked them red in the revised manuscript.
4. In the Summary section, the dosage of adsorbent (10mg) is not correct,
it should be 10mg/L or 10 mg/mL…. The volume of the solution should
be given.
Response: Thank you to give the proper word, We have corrected the
error and marked them red in the revised manuscript.
5. Did the authors check the precipitation of U(VI) at pH 6.0?
Response: Thank you for your careful reading. In our experiment, when
the pH of the solution was 6.0, we did not find the precipitation of U(VI)
in the solution we prepared.
6. What is the main mechanism of the sorption of U(VI)?
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. The kinetic and
thermodynamic experiments show that the adsorption processes is in
good agreement to the pseudo-second-order kinetics model and is an
endothermic reaction, and the reaction is spontaneous, confirm that the
adsorption process is chemical adsorption. In addition, The adsorption
mechanism of modified PPP for uranyl ions was further proved by the
analysis of IR. The results indicate that the modified PPP may achieve
the purpose of removing UO22+ from solutions through surface
complexation and ion exchange. In the article, we add relevant
explanations.
Reviewer: 2
1. In lines between 17 and 27 on page 4, in the section of 2. Introduction,
“Tao Dong et al. [18] used barium metaphosphate as an adsorbent to
study the adsorption properties of uranyl ions under various conditions
and the maximum adsorption capacity can reach 261.78 mg/g under the
optimal conditions; Zhang Zongbo et al [19] synthesized polyamino-
containing ligands modified ordered mesoporous materials with surface
area 1052 cm2/g, and the adsorption of uranium can reach 454 mg/g.
Although the above studies obtain excellent results on adsorption of
uranyl ions, they have disadvantages about high costs and secondary
pollution.” You determined the adsorbed amount of uranyl ion by the
modified PPP adsorbent as 42.733 mg/g. Tao Dong et al. found 6 times
higher uranyl ion adsorption capacity, and Zhang Zongbo et al found
higher than 10 times. You claim that these studies have disadvantages
about high costs and secondary pollution. Did you calculate their costs
and also your cost? You used various materials and chemicals to obtain
the modified PPP. Moreover, experiments were conducted at 50 <U+2103>.
Also, what is secondary pollution that these studies have but your study
does not have.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. After our investigation, we
found that most of their research is synthetic materials, raw materials
are not easy to obtain, and the raw materials of ppp materials we
prepared are cheap and easy to get Pomelo Peel. It is well known that
the production of Pomelo is extremely rich in China. Simultaneously,
this also produces a large amount of agricultural waste. It can be said
that the raw material of Pomelo peel as adsorbent is relatively low cost,
and it also reduces environmental pollution. Hence, our research aims
to make full use of large amounts of agricultural waste and provide a
new material for the treatment of nuclear industry wastewater. Some of
the less rigorous words have been corrected and marked them red in the
revised manuscript.
2. In lines between 11 and 15 on page 5, in the section of 4.2. BET,
“According to the data in the table, the BET surface area of the modified
PPP is 36.733 m2/g, indicating the modified PPP adsorbent with a large
BET surface area which has potential adsorption properties for UO22+.”
How do you know that indicating the modified PPP adsorbent with a
large BET surface area which has potential adsorption properties for
UO22+ only from Table 1? Also, is a BET surface area of 36.733 m2/g
high for you? What is your criterion to be a high BET surface area?
Response: Thank you for your valuable and thoughtful comments. We
are sorry to have an unclear writing. we have rewritten this part and
marked red in the revised manuscript.
It is well known that the larger the specific surface area of the
adsorbent, so the surface active sites will increase, simultaneously, this
is advantageous for adsorption. The PPP becomes fluffy by chemical
modification, and the specific surface area also increases, so we think
that the modified PPP has potential adsorption properties for uranyl ions.
3. After line 60 on page 5, in the section of 4.5. IR, “… a distinct O-U
characteristic peak appeared at the wavenumber of 1383 cm-1.” The
peak at 1383 cm-1 is already present at the infrared spectrum of the
modified PPP in Figure 4(a). You should give more clear explanations
for all the peaks, and you should cite all the peaks that were given in
previous studies.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have corrected the error
in our manuscript and marked red in the revised manuscript.
This phenomenon illustrates that the structure AAUI has changed.
The wave number of the O-H stretching vibration peak changed to 3428
cm-1, suggesting that its contribution to surface complexation reactions
cannot be ignored, The peak at 1742 cm-1 correspond to C=O stretching
vibration, which is obviously weakened, this indicates that the influence
of uranyl ions on the adsorbent of C=O was probably related to the
complexation between them. The characteristic peak is significantly
enhanced and moving to high wavenumbers at near 1383 cm-1, and the
peak correspond to -CH symmetric bending vibrations -CHOH suggest
that complexation reaction between -CHOH and UO22+. The reason for
the above change may be due to the adsorption of uranyl ions at the
active site on the surface of PPP, replacing the H+ on the surface group
of the adsorbent.
4. In lines between 27 and 32 on page 8, in the section of 4.6. Effect of
pH, “When pH>5.0, as the alkalinity of the solution increases, the
hydroxide ion concentration in the solution continuously increases,
hydroxide ion and uranyl ions can form some ions with lower adsorption
affinity …” However, in Fig.10 whose caption is comparison of
adsorption properties between modified and unmodified PPP, the
parameters are C0=35 mg/L,V=20 mL, T=50<U+2103>,m=10 mg, pH=6.0,
t=90 min. Why did you adjust pH to 6.0? Also, readers would want to
see uranyl ion adsorption by the modified PPP at pH>7.0.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have added an
explanation in our manuscript and marked red in the revised manuscript.
Our study concluded that the optimal adsorption pH is a range,
considering that we want to make the adsorption conditions closer to
neutral. Herein, we chose pH=6.0
when pH=5.0-6.0, the adsorption rate and the amount of adsorption
change only slightly; When pH>6.0, the adsorption rate and the amount
of adsorption are lower. So the optimum pH for the adsorption of uranyl
ions by modified PPP was 5.0-6.0.
5. There are many papers related to the adsorption of uranium ions.
Therefore, authors can add the comparisons of uranium ion adsorption
capacities by different adsorbents. Also, their costs and efficiencies can
be added.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. After our investigation, we
found that most of their research is synthetic materials, raw materials
are not easy to obtain, and the PPP materials we prepare are cheap and
easy to obtain. It is well known that the production of Pomelo is
extremely rich in China. Simultaneously, pomelo peel is often thrown
away as waste. It can be said that the raw material adsorbent with
pomelo peel as the adsorbent costs relatively low, but also reduces
environmental pollution. Therefore, our research aims to make full use
of a large amount of agricultural waste to provide a new material for
nuclear industry wastewater treatment.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors used the PPP as raw materials to prepare the adsorbent. The
factors of different adsorption conditions such as pH value, adsorption
temperature, mass of adsorption time, and initial concentration of UO22+
were investigated. This work has a certain innovation. However, there
are several imperfections in the manuscript and the experimental results
haven’t presented well. Therefore, a major revision should be finished
in order to suitable for these journals, and the detailed comments are as
follows:
1. The introduction parts should re-write.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have improved the
introduction section
2. Page 7, line 10, the specific surface area, average pore diameters, and
pore volume of the unmodified PPP should be added in the Table 1.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have added these data of
the unmodified PPP ( Table 1 BET surface area,Pore volume and
average Pore diameters of samples).
3. Page 8, line 46, it can be seen that when the temperature is between
50-70 <U+2103>, the adsorption performance of UO22+ is the best. Typically,
in adsorption experiment, we may like to choose room temperature. The
author said the best temperature is 50-70 <U+2103>. Please give the reasons.
Response: Thanks for your careful reading. We are sorry to have an
error writing. we have corrected it and marked red in the revised
manuscript. The thermodynamic experiments show that the adsorption
processes is an endothermic reaction, when the temperature is between
50-70<U+2103>, the adsorption capacity and the adsorption rate change only
slightly with the increase of temperature. Usually, the wastewater
produced by the nuclear industry has a certain temperature. For ease of
operation, experiments were conducted at 50 <U+2103>.
4. Page 9, line 3, with the increase of adsorbent dose, the adsorption
amount decrease from 23.715 mg/g to 6.583 mg/g. Please give lots of
experimental data to prove it.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We are sorry to have an
unclear writing.
The effect of the mass of adsorbent dose on the adsorption was
analyzed. As shown in Figure 7, increasing the adsorbent dose from 250
mg/L to 1250 mg/L, the adsorption efficiency of uranyl ions gradually
increased from 59.29% to 82.30%. The main reason is that with the
amount of adsorbent increasing, the number of active sites for
adsorption increases and the adsorption rate of uranyl ions can also
gradually increase; With the increase of adsorbent dose, the adsorption
amount decreases from 23.715 mg/g to 6.583 mg/g. however, the
concentration of uranyl ions is constant, with the mass of adsorbent
increasing, the amount of adsorbed uranium per unit mass decreases, so
that the amount of adsorption decreases.
5. Page 9, line 29, the adsorption of uranyl ions by modified PPP mainly
takes place on the outer surface and the inner surface of the sample.
Please give the reasons.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We are sorry to have an
unclear writing. The adsorption mechanism is obtained by reference to
some literatures, such as Chemical Engineering Journal. 2018,
343, 460-466, and references are listed in our article
6. Page 19, fig. 6 should be improved.
Response: Thank you for reading carefully. We have corrected the error
and marked them red in the revised manuscript.
7. The authors should prove the recyclability of the absorbed by
performing recycling experiments .
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have added the recycling
experiments
and marked red in the revised manuscript
8. There exist some minor errors including spelling grammar and format
for this paper.
Response: Thank you to give the proper word. We have corrected the
error and marked them red in the revised manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors made a new chemical modified PPP from pomelo pulp (PPP)
by fermentation, cooking and freeze-drying. The adsorbent was
characterized by means of SEM, IR, BET and EDS. The effects of
different adsorption conditions (pH, adsorption temperature, adsorbent
quality, adsorption time, initial concentration of UO22+) on the adsorbent
performance were studied.
The experiment of this paper is feasible, but there is no obvious
innovation. There are many results and papers about similar modified
adsorbents. The adsorption mechanism was discussed but not enough.
The optimum adsorption conditions obtained by the author are relatively
common, and there is no new knowledge about adsorption behavior.
However, the PPP chosen by the authors, as a waste, can be used for
other purposes rather than simply adsorption. I suggest that they have
an in-depth understanding of the potential of this material and make full
use of it in a more appropriate place(or valuable products, such as
chemicals)instead of using complex steps to make water treatment
adsorbents.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. The purpose of our
preliminary research is to provide a cheap and easy-to-obtain material
for the treatment of nuclear industry wastewater. Due to the huge output
of agricultural waste, such as Pomelo peel’s pulp, we will make rational
use of it and contribute to the environmental management. For the
adsorption mechanism, we will continue In-depth study in the later stage.
We appreciate for Editors/Reviewers’ warm work earnestly, and hope
that the correction will meet with approval.
Once again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.
