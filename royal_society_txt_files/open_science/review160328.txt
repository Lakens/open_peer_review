Dear Dr. De Groote et al.,
I have greatly enjoyed reviewing your paper which is well worth publishing and will be widely
read. All my comments are minor - most are editorial - and can be found on the attached pdf (I
prefer to review and edit with a red pen). These comments are all straightforward, and revision
should be quick and easy. See Appendix A.
My 2016 paper, which was probably being published about the time you were submitting, also
points the finger at Dawson, but from a different direction. It makes various comments that are of
relevance to your paper. I have attached a pdf of this, too, for your information.
Please send me a pdf on publication!
Yours sincerely,
All best wishes,
Professor Stephen K. Donovan, Naturalis, Leiden

Review of De Groote et al “New genetic and morphological evidence suggests a single hoaxer
created ‘Piltdown Man’.
The manuscript corroborates old and provides new evidence on a by now well-established fact
that the ‘Piltdown Man’ was a scientific hoax. In particular, it aims to establish whether the hoax
could be linked to a single individual. From a historic perspective, I think the current manuscript
offers an interesting insight into how the specimens were forged and adds novel aspects of the
forgery that were previously unknown. As such, it sheds new evidence of how one of the biggest
hoaxes in scientific history was carried out. Having said this, I think the authors went through a
lot of trouble to confirm earlier speculations on several key issues, and I am not sure to what
extend the current study reports anything ground-breaking new. Some of the ‘issues’, for instance
from how many orang-utans the used specimens were, appear to be a strawman. However, if the
study is taken for what it is – a thorough re-investigation of an important case of scientific fraud –
I think it certainly has its merits. Thus, I recommend publication in Royal Society Open Science.
In enjoyed reading the paper, as it is well presented and without any flaws as far as I can tell.

35
36
37 Solving the Piltdown hoax is still important now; it stands as a cautionary tale to scientists not to see
38
39 what they want to see, but to remain objective and to subject even their own findings to the
40
41 strongest scientific scrutiny. The study ot/pittao*n ly3pl presented here uses scientific methods not 7
42
43 available in the earlier 20th Century: DNA analyses, high-precision measurements, spectroscopy and

46
47
48
answers that have eluded previous investigators. To focus orr ,"r"rr.h, we identified the following
49
50 series of questions that, if resolved, would narrow down the number of plausible scenarios for the
51

18
19 the years, at least 20 others have been accused of being the perpetrat o, but in many cases the
20
fl,
21 allegation also includes Dawson as co-conspirator. This is largely because the story originated with
22
23 him, he brought the first specimens to Dr Arthur Smith Woodward, Keeper of Geology at the British
24
25 Museum (Natural History) in L9t2, nothing was ever found at the site when Dawson was not there,

31
human, were discovered in the localities after his death in 1%6

33
34
Not only did Dawson have the access and connections necessary to obtain the specimens, he was
35
36
37 also a great networker, and would have known what the British scientific community was
38
39 anticipating in a&issins tin0etween apes and humans: a large brain, an ape-like face and jaws,
40
41 and heavily fossilised materials that indicated great antiquity. As a long-established collector, he
42
43 would also have known what to add in the form of fossil mammals and stone tools to testify to its
44
45 antiquity. The strategy of the forger(s), in terms of whether the material was sequentially planted at
46
47
the Piltdown I and Piltdown ll sites following a pre-determined master-plan or as a response to the
4B
49 /
50 reactions engendered by the announcements of the finds, is still unclear (e.g., compare lTal B!4!,,

6

8
I friend. lt was written on 28 December 1909:

12 'My husbond, as you will see by enclosed oppreciotions, hos, for o quorter of o century devoted his

Nothing ever came of the letter. Even at this time, Dawson could already have been working on the
27
28
29 Piltdown forgery which did at last lead to his nomination for election as a Fellow of the Royal Society
30
31 in 1913. His nomination was not successful; however, not being elected at the first attempt is not

3 Dr Arthur Keith of the Royal College of Surgeons ridiculed il, as The limes reported the following
4
5 day. Just 18 days later, on 30 August, the canine, remarkably similar to the model one Smith
6
7 Woodward had inserted in the reconstructed jaw, was found and its timely discovery effectively
8
9
silenced many of the critics. The forged wear on the Piltdown ll molar, however, is certainly much
10
11
12 more sophisticated than that on the Piltdown I M1 and M2, and it may be that feedback from
13
14 discussions after the first finds were announced contributed to this improvement. So many of the
15
16 hominid bones and teeth from Piltdown I and Piltdown ll show a common technical pattern that
17
18 there seems no reason to suppose that more than one person was responsible for producing them
19
20 all, even though they may have been crafted over a number of years.
21
22
23 Despite the consistency in production, our novel analyses of the materials from Piltdown have
24
25 shown that the forger was not a trained conservator. Some aspects of the work show inexpert skills,

40

4B
49
50 and some palaeontolog .* y',r/ ,t is an extraordinary list, but none of it appears to have greatly
51
52 furthered his archaeological or palaeontological career. ln 1909, he wrote to Smith Woodward,

46

crown height and cervix shape, as well as in the presence of distinctive orang-utan-like wrinkling of

The question remains how the orang-utan mandible ended up in the hands of the forger. All of the

35 suspects mentioned in the introduction above would have had access to museum collections and

46 Two or perhaps three, possibly medieval, humans were used to make up the cranial 'fossils'. The

15

17
18 symphysis. This would also have had the effect of widening the tooth sockets, making it easier to
19
20 remove the teeth from the mandible. Great ape molar teeth are very difficult to extract without

Dear Editor and Subject Editor,
Many thanks to you and the two reviewers for the comments on our manuscript. We were very
pleased the reviewers enjoyed our paper and have made the changes suggested by Reviewer 1.
These were mostly editorial and included updating some of the references. We have referenced Prof.
Donovan's latest paper as it was very relevant to the manuscript.
We have also uploaded a short and longer press statement and have additional images of the
specimens and CT scans should you think they would be useful.
We look forward to hearing from you soon. Please do not hesitate to contact me should you need
any more information.
With kind regards,
Isabelle De Groote
