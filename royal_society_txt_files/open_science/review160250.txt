Comments to the Author(s)
General comments
1. The presentation of the paper is unacceptably careless throughout, with lack of clarity about
the methods employed and lack of consistency. This is especially disappointing given the interest
and importance of the evidence presented of local adaptation.
2. I was disappointed that the authors did not make the obvious connection between locally
adapted populations and a species’ capacity to respond to climatic change; that such local
adaptation, assuming that it is genetically based, may well hinder response to climatic change is a
serious cause for concern.
3. In text citations are incorrectly formatted, being cited by author and date but listed in the
bibliography in order of first appearance in the text. This makes finding the related entries in the
bibliography extremely difficult. The citations should either simply be by number (e.g. [1,2,3]) or
by author and number (e.g. Parmesan[1]). I feel that the authors should have checked a recent
issue of the journal before preparing their manuscript, or better still used the EndNote Style that
can be downloaded from the Royal Society website.
Specific comments
1. Page 2, lines 9–10 – I find it troubling that the authors begin their Abstract with a statement that
implies that phenological responses of species to warming are generally “evolutionary
responses”. Whilst it is the case that some phenological responses of species to warming may
involve genetic adaptation, and hence evolution, it is likely that most such responses, far from
reflecting evolution, are in reality constrained by the species’ prior long-term evolutionary
history and/or reflect an inability to show an appropriate short-term evolutionary response even
where this would be advantageous. The authors then go on to suggest that the weak evidence for
evolutionary adaptation shown by phenological responses may indicate that phenological
changes are relatively weakly related to fitness. This suggestion seems to me not to be supported
by evidence. Furthermore, that the key stages of most species’ annual phenological cycles are
tuned to environmental cues, often in such a way as, for example, to maximise food availability at
a critical life stage, strongly suggests that phenological responses to shifts in those cues are highly
likely to be related to fitness.
2. Page 5, lines 94–97 – The method used to derive the “annual winter frost day index” is unclear.
It is stated that this was calculated “using the monthly number of frost days averaged across the
autumn and winter (Oct – Mar)”. This implies that six monthly values for the number of frost
days (i.e. the numbers of frost days in the months of October to March) were averaged, the index
thus being not an ‘annual’ index as I would understand it (the sum of the monthly numbers of
frost days would give an ‘annual’ index), but an index of the average monthly number of frost
days for the six winter months. Clarification is needed here: either the index was calculated as the
authors state, in which case it does not qualify as ‘annual’, except in the sense that presumably
they computed ‘annual’ values of the index separately for each year, although they do not state
this in their account of their Methods, or else they computed the index in some other way, which
seems unlikely given the values I see on the axes of their figures where the frost index appears.
The situation with respect to this index is further confused by the statement on page 10 (lines
201–2) that winter severity was measured as the “annual number of winter frost days (FD)”,
implying quite clearly that this index was obtained by a summation of the monthly numbers of
frost days for the winter months, which is not what the authors’ earlier text implies… The same
expression, i.e. “annual number of winter frost days”, is used in the headings to Tables 1 and 2
and in the caption to Figure 1, whilst in the captions to Figures 2 and 3 reference is made to the
4
“regional mean number of winter frost days”… Consistency and clarity in relation to this
measure that is so central to the paper are essential.
3. The authors quote correlation results (page 8 onwards) using the notation “r8”. This notation
and what it means are unfamiliar to this reviewer, and I suspect will also be unfamiliar to many
intended readers. Furthermore, despite some research, I have been unable to discover how to
interpret this notation. The authors thus need to explain the meaning of this notation.
4. Page 10, lines 212–3 – The authors could usefully broaden somewhat their evidence of local
adaptation to climate by considering some of the published evidence of such adaptation seen in
plants. Bennie et al. (2010), for example, demonstrate local adaptation to climate in relation to the
phenology of bud burst in Betula and go on to explore how this may influence the species’
response to climatic change. Bennie, J., Kubin, E., Wiltshire, A., Huntley, B. & Baxter, R. (2010)
Predicting spatial and temporal patterns of bud-burst and spring frost risk in north-west Europe:
the implications of local adaptation to climate. Global Change Biology, 16, 1503-1514.
5. Page 12, lines 255–268 – Is it not most likely that the lower population density in frostier
regions reflects a reduced resource base, and hence a reduced carrying capacity for wrens, in
these regions as a consequence of the climatic conditions being less favourable for maintaining
populations of the invertebrates upon which the species feeds, thus necessitating increased
territory size?
6. Page 12, lines 271–275 – I do not find persuasive the authors’ conclusion that their results
suggest that evolution in response to climatic change “is most likely to be found in systems where
climate change has a strong impact on fitness, and there is high potential for local evolution
through fast generation times and low dispersal”. In saying this I am not disagreeing with the
latter statement, but I do disagree with the assertion that this is suggested by the authors’ results.
The study they present provides no evidence that wren populations in Great Britain have shown
any evolutionary response to climatic change, despite the species’ suitable characteristics for
doing so. Indeed, if anything, the absence of any evidence for selective mortality according to
body size tends to argue against any rapid adaptive response to climatic change. In order to
provide such evidence the authors would need to have long-term data on both climate and the
morphometrics of wren populations. I suspect that the BTO may well have access to such
morphometric data spanning several decades. A regionalised analysis of these data in relation to
regional climatic trends might reveal evidence that would “suggest” what the authors’ present
results do not! (Even within the British Isles climatic trends of the past half century show regional
differentiation with respect to a number of biologically significant climatic variables, even if this
is not apparent with respect to the index of frost days used by the authors.)
Minor errors and corrections needed
1. What is signified by the yellow highlighting of some text in both the paper and the
supplementary information? (Eventually this is explained when one reaches the authors’
responses to reviews of a previous submission.)
2. Page 2, line 21 & numerous further instances throughout the text – I was taught that the
convention when referring to an organism in scientific writing was to use a singular construction
(i.e. “winter wren individuals” rather than “individual wrens”); the use of “wrens” was
considered to be colloquial in style and thus inappropriate in scientific writing. Furthermore, in
this case it is also ambiguous, given that there are many species that have “wren” as part of their
common name. Please amend the text throughout to use the appropriate construction for
scientific writing.
3. Page 4, lines 56–7 – Either ‘abundances’ in line 56, or ‘is influenced’ in line 57, but one way or
the other the subject and verb need to agree as to whether they are singular or plural.
4. Page 4, line 66 – “wren” (as here) or “winter wren” (as in the Abstract, line 14)? The use of the
common name needs to be consistent! Given that ‘winter wren’ is now the generally accepted
name for this species, that is what should be used.
5. Page 5, line 88 – “from dataset” should be “from the dataset”.
5
6. Page 5, line 89 – Were the data analysed “within 10 regions”, implying that the analyses were
done independently for the 10 regions, or were the grid square data “aggregated for 10 regions
prior to analysis”, which makes more sense and seems to correspond to what I see in the
analyses? Please clarify.
7. Page 7, lines 136–7 – “modelling … growth rate (<U+03BB>) a function of” surely should be “modelling
… growth rate (<U+03BB>) as a function of”.
8. Page 8, line 158 – Either “with a normal error” or “with normal errors”, but NOT “with a
normal errors” as written by the authors.
9. Page 11, line 245 – “physiology other mechanisms” should be “physiology or other
mechanisms”.
10. Figure S1 – the main text refers to “regions”, whereas the Figure title (which incidentally by
convention ought to be below the figure rather than above it) refers to “districts” – amend for
consistency. 4
11. Figure S2 – As noted earlier, given that the maximum value plotted for the mean number of
frost days is <11, I can only conclude that this is not the mean total for the six winter months, but
the mean monthly number of frost days across those six months. This needs to be clarified in the
text as indicated above.
12. Figure S4 – Whereas the figure caption states that the graph shows mean wing length, the y-
axis label indicates that what is plotted is mass. Which is it?? Please sort out, correct and make
consistent!

The revisions made address almost all of my points. Only two things remain about which I
would disagree with the authors. The use of a subscript to indicate degrees of freedom is indeed
conventional with some test statistics (e.g. F), but not in my experience with r. I suggest that for
the sake of clarity the authors explicitly indicate the degrees of freedom rather than using the
subscript. My only remaining issue relates to the interpretation of their statement that that their
results
suggest that evolution in response to climatic change “is most likely to be found in systems where
climate change has a strong impact on fitness...". As I tried, but obviously failed, to make clear
earlier, what I am questioning is whether their results suggest this conclusion. I am not
persuaded that they do, but perhaps this is an issue of differences in interpretation of what is
written and of the results presented....

This is a compelling and thorough study on the relationship between climate parameters,
population growth rates and body mass across wren populations in the UK. The revisions made

publication in Open Science.
Two minor points:
Line 159: it is not certain that the decline is caused by cold winters; I would qualify this and use a

whilst in the captions to Figures 2 and 3 reference is made to the “regional mean number of winter frost
days”… Consistency and clarity in relation to this measure that is so central to the paper are essential.
3. The authors quote correlation results (page 8 onwards) using the notation “r8”. This notation and what

We thank the reviewer for highlighting this gap in our discussion and we have amended the final
paragraph in the ms to highlight these issues:
‘Evolution is one of the three mechanisms by which a population can persist in response to
climate change (the others being dispersal and phenotypic plasticity) [13]. The extent to which
populations may adapt to climate change through evolution will depend upon trait heritability, the
strength of selection and the rate of environmental change. Although we have not quantified these
parameters, we present evidence that is consistent with winter wren populations being locally
adapted to their climate, and partial evidence that this is driven by spatial variation in body size.
Given that few studies have identified genetic responses to climate change [57-58], our results
suggest that such evolution may be most likely to be found in systems where climate change has a
strong impact on fitness, and where there are is high potential for local evolution through fast
generation times and low dispersal, as is the case for the winter wren. Although, much research on
evolutionary adaptation to climate change has focussed on phenological change, studies considering
the selection of traits, such as body size, which affect individual fitness in response to climate-driven
mortality, such as extreme events, may be equally or more useful. In such instances, work to
quantify heritability and the strength of selection associated with these traits will be required to
quantify the extent to which evolution may help species adapt to future climate change.’
3. In text citations are incorrectly formatted, being cited by author and date but listed in the
bibliography in order of first appearance in the text. This makes finding the related entries in the
bibliography extremely difficult. The citations should either simply be by number (e.g. [1,2,3]) or
by author and number (e.g. Parmesan[1]). I feel that the authors should have checked a recent
issue of the journal before preparing their manuscript, or better still used the EndNote Style that
can be downloaded from the Royal Society website.
Thank you for highlighting our error here. We have amended the citations in the text to numbers as is
the format of open science.
Specific comments
1. Page 2, lines 9–10 – I find it troubling that the authors begin their Abstract with a statement
that implies that phenological responses of species to warming are generally “evolutionary
responses”. Whilst it is the case that some phenological responses of species to warming may
involve genetic adaptation, and hence evolution, it is likely that most such responses, far from
reflecting evolution, are in reality constrained by the species’ prior long-term evolutionary history
and/or reflect an inability to show an appropriate short-term evolutionary response even where
this would be advantageous. The authors then go on to suggest that the weak evidence for
evolutionary adaptation shown by phenological responses may indicate that phenological changes
are relatively weakly related to fitness. This suggestion seems to me not to be supported by
evidence. Furthermore, that the key stages of most species’ annual phenological cycles are tuned
to environmental cues, often in such a way as, for example, to maximise food availability at a
critical life stage, strongly suggests that phenological responses to shifts in those cues are highly
likely to be related to fitness.
Our first sentence does not imply that phenological responses of species to warming are generally
“evolutionary responses”, but rather that most evolutionary studies have examined phenological
responses. We think that the reviewer has misread or misunderstood this first. On reflection, our
suggestion that phenology is weakly related to fitness doesn’t fully describe what we mean, and so
we have amended L10-14 to clarify this:
‘Most studies of evolutionary responses to climate change have focussed on phenological responses
to warming, and provide only weak evidence for evolutionary adaptation. This could be because
phenological changes are more weakly linked to fitness than more direct mechanisms of climate
change impacts, such as selective mortality during extreme weather events which have immediate
fitness consequences for the individuals involved.’
2. Page 5, lines 94–97 – The method used to derive the “annual winter frost day index” is unclear.
It is stated that this was calculated “using the monthly number of frost days averaged across the
autumn and winter (Oct – Mar)”. This implies that six monthly values for the number of frost days
(i.e. the numbers of frost days in the months of October to March) were averaged, the index thus
being not an ‘annual’ index as I would understand it (the sum of the monthly numbers of frost
days would give an ‘annual’ index), but an index of the average monthly number of frost days for
the six winter months. Clarification is needed here: either the index was calculated as the authors
state, in which case it does not qualify as ‘annual’, except in the sense that presumably they
computed ‘annual’ values of the index separately for each year, although they do not state this in
their account of their Methods, or else they computed the index in some other way, which seems
unlikely given the values I see on the axes of their figures where the frost index appears.
Yes we agree that this has been misnamed an annual index as, as the reviewer points out, it is only
for the winter months. We have therefore renamed this index as ‘a winter frost day index (FD)’ and
define it in the methods:
‘Therefore we created a winter frost day index (FD) (1994 – 2011) for each of the 10 regions (Fig S1)
by taking an average of the number of frost days per month across the autumn and winter (Oct –
Mar) from http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/summaries/datasets.’
Though out the manuscript we now refer to this index as ‘a winter frost day index (FD)’ and have
removed all mention of it being an annual index.
The situation with respect to this index is further confused by the statement on page 10 (lines
201–2) that winter severity was measured as the “annual number of winter frost days (FD)”,
implying quite clearly that this index was obtained by a summation of the monthly numbers of
frost days for the winter months, which is not what the authors’ earlier text implies…
We have changed ‘annual’ to ‘average’.
The same expression, i.e. “annual number of winter frost days”, is used in the headings to Tables 1
and 2 and in the caption to Figure 1, whilst in the captions to Figures 2 and 3 reference is made to
the “regional mean number of winter frost days”… Consistency and clarity in relation to this
measure that is so central to the paper are essential.
These are 2 different climatic variables, which are used for separate analysis in the manuscript:
1 – ‘The annual number of winter frost days’, which we define as FD in the methods, has now been
changed to winter frost day index (FD) (1994 – 2011) (see above for definition). We have added the
definition of this variable to the legend of figure 1 and table 1 and 2.
2 – ‘Regional mean number of winter frost days’, which we define as FDC in the methods and is the
overall mean of the FD index for each region.
We have clarified these differences in the methods section:
‘Previous analysis has demonstrated a strong link between annual wren survival and the number of
winter frost days [30]. Therefore we created a winter frost day index (FD) (1994 – 2011) for each of
the 10 regions (Fig S1) by taking an average of the number of frost days per month across the
autumn and winter (Oct – Mar) from http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/summaries/datasets.
We calculated the regional mean number of winter frost days (FDC), as a measure of current climate,
by taking the mean of the frost day indices (1994 – 2011) for each region, and the historical regional
climate (FDH), as the regional mean of the annual values for the World Meteorological Office’s
international standard reference period (1961-1990).’
3. The authors quote correlation results (page 8 onwards) using the notation “r8”. This notation
and what it means are unfamiliar to this reviewer, and I suspect will also be unfamiliar to many
intended readers. Furthermore, despite some research, I have been unable to discover how to
interpret this notation. The authors thus need to explain the meaning of this notation.
In this notation the r refers to the correlation coefficient and the 8 is the number of degrees of
freedom. The inclusion of the degrees of freedom as a subscript is common in statistical notation.
4. Page 10, lines 212–3 – The authors could usefully broaden somewhat their evidence of local
adaptation to climate by considering some of the published evidence of such adaptation seen in
plants. Bennie et al. (2010), for example, demonstrate local adaptation to climate in relation to
the phenology of bud burst in Betula and go on to explore how this may influence the species’
response to climatic change. Bennie, J., Kubin, E., Wiltshire, A., Huntley, B. & Baxter, R. (2010)
Predicting spatial and temporal patterns of bud-burst and spring frost risk in north-west Europe:
the implications of local adaptation to climate. Global Change Biology, 16, 1503-1514.
We thank the reviewer for highlighting this interesting study, we have now referred to it in the
manuscript as further evidence of local adaption of phenology to climate (Line 201).
5. Page 12, lines 255–268 – Is it not most likely that the lower population density in frostier
regions reflects a reduced resource base, and hence a reduced carrying capacity for wrens, in these
regions as a consequence of the climatic conditions being less favourable for maintaining
populations of the invertebrates upon which the species feeds, thus necessitating increased
territory size?
Yes it is possible that this could be a mechanism behind our finding that winter wren population
densities are lower in colder regions of the UK, and we have now noted this specifically (L241-242):
‘Firstly, spatial variation in density may not be limited by winter climate influencing survival, but
other demographic parameters, such as spatial variation in reproductive success, which could be
linked to climate through variation in food resources or other ecological parameters.’
However, given that our results provide an alternative mechanism, we think it is also valuable to
outline that, which we do in the second half of this paragraph.
6. Page 12, lines 271–275 – I do not find persuasive the authors’ conclusion that their results
suggest that evolution in response to climatic change “is most likely to be found in systems where
climate change has a strong impact on fitness, and there is high potential for local evolution
through fast generation times and low dispersal”. In saying this I am not disagreeing with the
latter statement, but I do disagree with the assertion that this is suggested by the authors’ results.
The study they present provides no evidence that wren populations in Great Britain have shown
any evolutionary response to climatic change, despite the species’ suitable characteristics for
doing so. Indeed, if anything, the absence of any evidence for selective mortality according to
body size tends to argue against any rapid adaptive response to climatic change. In order to
provide such evidence the authors would need to have long-term data on both climate and the
morphometrics of wren populations. I suspect that the BTO may well have access to such
morphometric data spanning several decades. A regionalised analysis of these data in relation to
regional climatic trends might reveal evidence that would “suggest” what the authors’ present
results do not! (Even within the British Isles climatic trends of the past half century show regional
differentiation with respect to a number of biologically significant climatic variables, even if this is
not apparent with respect to the index of frost days used by the authors.)
Apologies if we’ve missed something but we have done what the referee appears to recommend,
analysing our long-term data on wren morphology in different regions to test whether there are
consistent changes in morphology between years which can be related to winter severity (L145-154).
However, there was no evidence of a significant effect, hence our statement of partial evidence
linking adaptation to body size. As outlined in the discussion (L213-218) this could simply reflect the
high noise to signal ratio in a small-bodies species such as the wren. Given that other studies do find
that body size correlates with individual mortality in response to extreme weather events (ref 24,
25), we advocate more detailed work is required to link wren survival with body size.
Minor errors and corrections needed
1. What is signified by the yellow highlighting of some text in both the paper and the
supplementary information? (Eventually this is explained when one reaches the authors’
responses to reviews of a previous submission.)
Yes, as stated at the start of the response to reviewers document the yellow highlighting was to draw
attention to the sections where we have made changed to the original manuscript. We have now
removed these and highlighted the additional changes suggested by the current reviewer.
2. Page 2, line 21 & numerous further instances throughout the text – I was taught that the
convention when referring to an organism in scientific writing was to use a singular construction
(i.e. “winter wren individuals” rather than “individual wrens”); the use of “wrens” was considered
to be colloquial in style and thus inappropriate in scientific writing. Furthermore, in this case it is
also ambiguous, given that there are many species that have “wren” as part of their common
name. Please amend the text throughout to use the appropriate construction for scientific
writing.
The structure we have used is to define species with its Latin name (winter wren, Troglodytes
troglodytes) at the first mention in the text and we subsequently refer to the species as ‘wren’ and
‘wrens’ as appropriate. We are happy to change this if it does not fit with the journal house style.
3. Page 4, lines 56–7 – Either ‘abundances’ in line 56, or ‘is influenced’ in line 57, but one way or
the other the subject and verb need to agree as to whether they are singular or plural.
Changed to ‘is influenced’.
4. Page 4, line 66 – “wren” (as here) or “winter wren” (as in the Abstract, line 14)? The use of the
common name needs to be consistent! Given that ‘winter wren’ is now the generally accepted
name for this species, that is what should be used.
Changed to ‘winter wren’.
5. Page 5, line 88 – “from dataset” should be “from the dataset”.
‘the’ inserted.
6. Page 5, line 89 – Were the data analysed “within 10 regions”, implying that the analyses were
done independently for the 10 regions, or were the grid square data “aggregated for 10 regions
prior to analysis”, which makes more sense and seems to correspond to what I see in the
analyses? Please clarify.
The spatial scale at which we looked for the effect of annual variation in FD on annual variation in
population growth rate was at the level of the region. Our analysis was not conducted independently
for the 10 regions nor were the data aggregated for 10 regions prior to analysis. Instead we used
general linear mixed models where the region was fitted either as a fixed effect and grid square (BBS
site) as a random effect. Thus we were able to make predictions about the within region annual
variation in population growth rate in response to changes in FDs while accounting for differences in
coverage between years. This methodology is clearly outlined from line 115 – 130. In order to clarify
that this analysis was not conducted independently for the 10 regions we have changed ‘within’ to
‘across’.
7. Page 7, lines 136–7 – “modelling … growth rate (<U+03BB>) a function of” surely should be “modelling …
growth rate (<U+03BB>) as a function of”.
‘as’ added.
8. Page 8, line 158 – Either “with a normal error” or “with normal errors”, but NOT “with a normal
errors” as written by the authors.
‘a’ removed.
9. Page 11, line 245 – “physiology other mechanisms” should be “physiology or other
mechanisms”.
‘or’ added.
10. Figure S1 – the main text refers to “regions”, whereas the Figure title (which incidentally by
convention ought to be below the figure rather than above it) refers to “districts” – amend for
consistency.
‘districts’ changed to ‘regions’. Figure titles moved to below the figures.
11. Figure S2 – As noted earlier, given that the maximum value plotted for the mean number of
frost days is <11, I can only conclude that this is not the mean total for the six winter months, but
the mean monthly number of frost days across those six months. This needs to be clarified in the
text as indicated above.
Yes this is correct, please see our response to above comment (specific comments 2).
12. Figure S4 – Whereas the figure caption states that the graph shows mean wing length, the y-
axis label indicates that what is plotted is mass. Which is it?? Please sort out, correct and make
consistent!
Thank you for highlighting this. This graph was inserted in the wrong place, we have now replaced it
with the correct figure, showing the relationship with wing length and mean number of winter frost
days.
Appendix C
Manuscript ID RSOS-160024
Thank you very much for the final comments our paper ‘Winter wren populations show
adaptation to local climate’. We are very pleased that the paper has been accepted for publication
in open science. We have responded to the last few reviewers comments below and highlighted
our changes to the manuscript in yellow.
Yours,

Reviewer: 1
The revisions made address almost all of my points. Only two things remain about which I would
disagree with the authors. The use of a subscript to indicate degrees of freedom is indeed
conventional with some test statistics (e.g. F), but not in my experience with r. I suggest that for
the sake of clarity the authors explicitly indicate the degrees of freedom rather than using the
subscript.
We have removed this notation and report our correlations in the standard format: (r = XX, n = XX, p
< XX).
My only remaining issue relates to the interpretation of their statement that that their results
suggest that evolution in response to climatic change “is most likely to be found in systems where
climate change has a strong impact on fitness...". As I tried, but obviously failed, to make clear
earlier, what I am questioning is whether their results suggest this conclusion. I am not persuaded
that they do, but perhaps this is an issue of differences in interpretation of what is written and of
the results presented....
We have changed the wording of this section to better reflect the findings of our study and removed
the above statement:
‘Relatively few studies have identified genetic responses to climate change [57-58]. Wrens may show
local adaptation to climate because there is a strong relationship between climate (winter cold) and
fitness coupled with a high potential for local evolution to occur through fast generation times and
low dispersal. This suggests that although much research on evolutionary adaptation to climate
change has focussed on phenological change, studies considering the selection of traits, such as body
size, which affect individual fitness in response to climate-driven mortality, such as extreme events,
may be equally or more useful.’

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a compelling and thorough study on the relationship between climate parameters,
population growth rates and body mass across wren populations in the UK. The revisions made by
the authors have greatly improved the quality of the manuscript and I now recommend it for
publication in Open Science.
Two minor points:
Line 159: it is not certain that the decline is caused by cold winters; I would qualify this and use a
less strong word than ‘due’
We have changed this sentence to weaken the causative link:
‘Wren populations declined in the last years of the study, during three cold winters (Fig. S2), prior to
which the population had increased, coincident with a period of mild winters.’
and 491: missing word?
Yes, we have added the word ‘of’.
