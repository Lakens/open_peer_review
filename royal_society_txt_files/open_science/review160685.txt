This paper was an enjoyable read -- well-written, clearly motivated, and carefully executed. I do
have a few questions and concerns regarding the analyses and interpretation that I hope the
authors will address:
1) In both experiments, the familiar faces were presented repeatedly during the adaptation task,
whereas each novel face was only presented once. It could be that the lack of serial dependence
observed for familiar faces doesn’t have to do with their familiarity per se, but rather that
participants remembered how they responded to a familiar face the last time they saw it and
simply repeated their responses. One way to test this alternative account would be to analyze
only the first presentation of each familiar face, asking whether serial dependence is still low
when there is no opportunity to repeat a previous response to the same face.
2) Figure 2B, low sensitivity group: Granted, there was not a significant difference between the
familiar and unfamiliar faces here, but the qualitative pattern is nonetheless puzzling. Why
would serial dependence for unfamiliar faces be so low? The high serial dependence for familiar
faces makes sense if the low d’ group simply could not learn them and they were treated like
unfamiliar faces. But there should also be significant serial dependence for unfamiliar faces (as in
Expt. 2). It would help readers interpret the results if the authors provided some possible reasons
for why the data look this way.
3) Is there also reduced serial dependence for faces that follow familiar faces? (ie, is it that
familiar faces are impervious to serial dependence but still contribute to the running average that
promotes perceptual continuity, or are they excluded entirely from serial dependence
computations?)
4) Why dichotomize the previous trial into “attractive” and “unattractive” rather than regress on
the attractiveness of the previous trial as a continuous measure?

In this very interesting manuscript, the authors tested whether familiarity with faces modulates
serial dependence in perceived face attractiveness. The authors replicate previous findings of
serial dependence, and also demonstrate a novel interaction whereby very familiar faces have a
reduced serial dependence effect. The experiments are creative, the manuscript is well written,
and the results are very interesting. I only have very minor comments, which should be taken as
optional, and I recommend publication.
1. The first experiment included a post hoc analysis, based on a split-half recognition analysis. P.
11 says that, “the participants’ ability to learn faces differed substantially across the individuals.”
Participants were therefore split into high and low d’ recognition scores. But, does the d’ score
reflect learning or just baseline sensitivity (or some combination)? Is the familiarity effect really
one of sensitivity? Are “learning” and baseline sensitivity separable? Is there a pre-post
difference score that could be used to estimate improvement in recognition (learning)? I think the
authors may already have the data to address the general point here, and added discussion of
sensitivity/learning/familiarity could help clarify this issue. Some previous authors (e.g.,
Cicchini and others) have argued or implied that sensitivity and serial dependence might be
inversely related. So, one might see the “familiarity” effect here as one of sensitivity (not learning
per se). If that’s the case, adding noise to the familiar faces might bring back some of the serial
dependence effect. Perhaps this is consistent with the authors’ thinking, but I wasn’t sure.
2. Part of the Fig 2 interaction is puzzling. The low recognition group difference between novel
and familiar is at odds with the overall theme in the paper that familiar faces do not show serial
dependence in attractiveness ratings (the t test had a p value of 0.06, which may not be
“significant”, but the effect size is obviously large, and nearly as large as the other t test which is
reported as being significant [d = 0.77 versus d = 0.81]). While I do find the results compelling,
this particular result indicates that some of the language in the manuscript would be better if
tempered. For example, “recognition of familiar faces is resistant” should be “recognition of
familiar faces can be resistant” (conclusion section) and “familiar faces [can] resist the temporal
integration…” (abstract), and other locations.
3. p. 14, lines 2-4. Confusing sentence, not clear what it means to repeat blocks or to have a “more
stable attractiveness rating” or why that’s necessary.
4. Fig 3. Is it possible there is a ceiling effect in rated attractiveness for familiar faces (solid black
line in panel A), and that is masking a serial dependence effect? For a subset of the familiar faces
with lower attractiveness (e.g., split half analysis) is the solid black line still flat?
5. p. 17, line 3, sentence starting “How does the visual…” Sentence is confusing/followed by a
fragment question.
6. The paper by Pegors et al raised the possibility that response bias might underlie some serial
effects, but a more recent paper in press by Xia, et al. (Not yet on JoV website, but the in-press
citation is Xia, et al., (2016) “Serial Dependence in the Perception of Attractiveness” and it should
be available soon) included several control analyses and designs that help rule out response bias.
That paper supports the authors’ arguments and would be worth citing in the paragraph on page
5 that discusses and rejects the response bias interpretation (paragraph starting with, “Several
factors argue against a response-bias interpretation.”). Xia et al paper is also relevant for the
discussion on page 18.

Reviewer #1
This paper was an enjoyable read -- well-written, clearly motivated, and carefully executed. I do have
a few questions and concerns regarding the analyses and interpretation that I hope the authors will
address:
We thank the reviewer for their careful reading of the manuscript and their generally positive
response.
1) In both experiments, the familiar faces were presented repeatedly during the adaptation task,
whereas each novel face was only presented once. It could be that the lack of serial dependence
observed for familiar faces doesn’t have to do with their familiarity per se, but rather that
participants remembered how they responded to a familiar face the last time they saw it and simply
repeated their responses. One way to test this alternative account would be to analyze only the first
presentation of each familiar face, asking whether serial dependence is still low when there is no
opportunity to repeat a previous response to the same face.
The reviewer has raised a valid concern, and one that we also noted while developing our
experiment. We acknowledge that this concern probably cannot be ruled out entirely and have now
acknowledged this in our paper (page 20).
An important aspect of our experimental design was keeping novel faces truly novel by only
presenting them once, but to also present familiar faces only once would mean that a huge set of
familiar and unfamiliar faces would be required. Practically, this would be difficult because training
people to remember even a small set of 20 faces was difficult (as evidenced by the existence of the
low sensitivity group in Experiment 1) and pilot testing of the recognisability of famous faces for
Experiment 2 found it was quite difficult to find faces that were reliably identified across
participants, which is to be expected. We have therefore tried to reduce this possibility by having a
continuous response scale rather than a discrete Likert scale – even if participants were consciously
attempting to recreate their last response, the continuous scale allowed for participants to skew
their remembered perception up or down following the presentation of the previous face.
We agree that the reviewer’s suggested analysis would be another interesting way to explore the
impact of serial dependence. We carried out this analysis for the interest of the reviewer but found
that neither experiment yielded a significant effect of familiarity on serial dependence (no
interaction between current face familiarity and previous face attractiveness on attractiveness scores
– Experiment 1: F(1,20) = 0.01, p = .924; Experiment 2: F(1,20) = 0.54; p = .470), and this did not
differ between the two sensitivity groups (no interaction between current face familiarity and
sensitivity on (n-1) effect sizes – Experiment 1: F(1,20) = .90; p = .355; Experiment 2: F(1,20) = 0.10; p
= .751). However, the overall (n-1) effect was also not significant in either experiment (no effect of
previous face attractiveness on current face attractiveness scores – Experiment 1: F(1,20) = 4.05, p =
.058; Experiment 2: F(1,20) = 1.73; p = .203), likely due to insufficient power.
It may be interesting to note that a visual examination of the results in Experiment 2 (see below)
where recognition sensitivity was higher (and ‘familiar’ faces more likely to be recognised by
participants) shows that results are trending in the direction of the hypotheses, which may mean
that with further power a significant pattern of results in the direction of the hypotheses would
hypotheses.
2) Figure 2B, low sensitivity group: Granted, there was not a significant difference between the
familiar and unfamiliar faces here, but the qualitative pattern is nonetheless puzzling. Why would
serial dependence for unfamiliar faces be so low? The high serial dependence for familiar faces
makes sense if the low d’ group simply could not learn them and they were treated like unfamiliar
faces. But there should also be significant serial dependence for unfamiliar faces (as in Expt. 2). It
would help readers interpret the results if the authors provided some possible reasons for why the
data look this way.
We agree with the reviewer that the qualitative pattern for the low sensitivity is intriguing. We
suggest that the participants in the low sensitivity group had not sufficiently learned the ‘familiar’
faces (perhaps due to a poor understanding of instructions or a lack in motivation), and as such, their
responses are more unreliable.
We have modified the discussion in our revised manuscript to include this point (see page 12).
3) Is there also reduced serial dependence for faces that follow familiar faces? (ie, is it that familiar
faces are impervious to serial dependence but still contribute to the running average that promotes
perceptual continuity, or are they excluded entirely from serial dependence computations?)
The reviewer raises an interesting question but we fear the current experiments lack sufficient
statistical power given the posthoc nature of this inquiry. Our focus was to determine whether the
serial dependence effect was reduced for familiar faces, given the strong theoretical justification for
this effect. Nonetheless, for the reviewer we have carried out analyses to investigate if this is borne
out in the data as an interesting posthoc thought. Overall there was no effect of previous face
familiarity or interaction involving previous face familiarity in either experiment, suggesting that
familiar faces still contribute to the running average that promotes perceptual continuity, but
themselves are impervious to serial dependence. We have summarised the relevant effects and
interactions below:
Experiment 1:
<U+F0B7> 2 x 2 x 2 (previous familiarity, current familiarity and previous attractiveness) repeated-
measures ANOVA on mean attractiveness ratings: all ps for effects involving previous face
familiarity > .176.
ANOVA on mean inter-trial attractiveness effects: all ps for effects involving previous face
familiarity > .066.
Experiment 2:
<U+F0B7> 2 x 2 x 2 (previous familiarity, current familiarity and previous attractiveness) repeated-
measures ANOVA on mean attractiveness ratings: all ps for effects involving previous face
familiarity > .467.
<U+F0B7> 2 x 2 x 2 (previous familiarity, current familiarity and recognition sensitivity) mixed model
ANOVA on mean inter-trial attractiveness effects: all ps for effects involving previous face
familiarity > .257.
Again, given our hypotheses concerned the impact of familiarity on the current percept (and a
concern about whether we have sufficient statistical power to support a posthoc analysis) we have
mentioned this idea and included it as a suggested avenue for future research in the manuscript (see
page 21).
4) Why dichotomize the previous trial into “attractive” and “unattractive” rather than regress on the
attractiveness of the previous trial as a continuous measure?
The reason this study was designed and analysed in this way was to keep the interpretation of the
results in line with previous published work: e.g., Taubert & Alais 2016; Taubert et al., 2016;
van der Burg, Alais & Cass (2013); van der Burg & Goodbourn (2015). While we can see the merits in
a regression onto the attractiveness of the previous trial, we are not certain whether this provides
more useful information for our experiment at this stage (given the scope of the current project and
the discrete nature of the research question). However, we believe it would be worthwhile for
future studies to consider alternative statistical analysis which considers variance in attractiveness
scores and we have noted this in the discussion (see page 19).
Reviewer #2
In this very interesting manuscript, the authors tested whether familiarity with faces modulates serial
dependence in perceived face attractiveness. The authors replicate previous findings of serial
dependence, and also demonstrate a novel interaction whereby very familiar faces have a reduced
serial dependence effect. The experiments are creative, the manuscript is well written, and the results
are very interesting. I only have very minor comments, which should be taken as optional, and I
recommend publication.
Thank you for your encouraging comments. We have addressed your comments below and have
made changes to the manuscript as suggested.
1. The first experiment included a post hoc analysis, based on a split-half recognition analysis. P. 11
says that, “the participants’ ability to learn faces differed substantially across the individuals.”
Participants were therefore split into high and low d’ recognition scores. But, does the d’ score reflect
learning or just baseline sensitivity (or some combination)? Is the familiarity effect really one of
sensitivity? Are “learning” and baseline sensitivity separable? Is there a pre-post difference score
that could be used to estimate improvement in recognition (learning)? I think the authors may
already have the data to address the general point here, and added discussion of
sensitivity/learning/familiarity could help clarify this issue. Some previous authors (e.g., Cicchini and
one might see the “familiarity” effect here as one of sensitivity (not learning per se). If that’s the
case, adding noise to the familiar faces might bring back some of the serial dependence effect.
Perhaps this is consistent with the authors’ thinking, but I wasn’t sure.
We agree, it is interesting to consider the difference between the two notions, but it is not
immediately clear to us how to test for recognition before any learning has taken place (the baseline
measurement would have to be independent, somehow). Furthermore, we would argue that the d’
scores reflect an individual’s sensitivity to the stimulus set – how this is different from familiarity
with the stimulus set is not clear to us either. Nevertheless, we have included a comment on the
nature of the d' scores on page 11.
We also agree that an interesting future avenue would be to see if adding noise to the familiar faces
may indeed affect any serial dependence effect, or lack thereof, and as such we have included
comments to this effect in the manuscript (see page 21).
2. Part of the Fig 2 interaction is puzzling. The low recognition group difference between novel and
familiar is at odds with the overall theme in the paper that familiar faces do not show serial
dependence in attractiveness ratings (the t test had a p value of 0.06, which may not be “significant”,
but the effect size is obviously large, and nearly as large as the other t test which is reported as being
significant [d = 0.77 versus d = 0.81]). While I do find the results compelling, this particular result
indicates that some of the language in the manuscript would be better if tempered. For example,
“recognition of familiar faces is resistant” should be “recognition of familiar faces can be resistant”
(conclusion section) and “familiar faces [can] resist the temporal integration…” (abstract), and other
locations.
We take your point and have tempered our interpretation in appropriate places in the manuscript
(see pages 2, 16, 17, 21).
We have also found a small error in our data manipulation in which two data cells were swapped.
We have updated the manuscript (on pages 11 and 12) and Figure 2 to reflect the correct statistics,
but note that the significant findings and patterns of results have not changed.
3. p. 14, lines 2-4. Confusing sentence, not clear what it means to repeat blocks or to have a “more
stable attractiveness rating” or why that’s necessary.
We apologise that this sentence was not clear and have reworded the sentence on page 14 to make
it easier to understand the experiment procedure.
To be clear: we repeated trials to obtain a better estimate of the each familiar face’s attractiveness
rating given the inherent variation that can occur when rating faces on a continuous scale (especially
given the effect of serial dependence predicts variation across trials dependent on the previous
trial).
4. Fig 3. Is it possible there is a ceiling effect in rated attractiveness for familiar faces (solid black line
in panel A), and that is masking a serial dependence effect? For a subset of the familiar faces with
lower attractiveness (e.g., split half analysis) is the solid black line still flat?
could rate the faces in the experiment is 200, and the mean attractiveness ratings of familiar faces in
Fig 3 is only 114.5.
Furthermore, pilot testing was done to help ensure we used famous faces of differing attractiveness
to avoid any ceiling effect. It may be that these familiar faces were attractive enough to have no
significant pull to previous attractive faces. However, given that the expected effect on a familiar
face following a previous unattractive face should be that it decreases in attractiveness, a ceiling
effect would not mask this effect.
5. p. 17, line 3, sentence starting “How does the visual…” Sentence is confusing/followed by a
fragment question.
Thank you for bringing this to our attention – we have corrected this sentence.
6. The paper by Pegors et al raised the possibility that response bias might underlie some serial
effects, but a more recent paper in press by Xia, et al. (Not yet on JoV website, but the in-press
citation is Xia, et al., (2016) “Serial Dependence in the Perception of Attractiveness” and it should be
available soon) included several control analyses and designs that help rule out response bias. That
paper supports the authors’ arguments and would be worth citing in the paragraph on page 5 that
discusses and rejects the response bias interpretation (paragraph starting with, “Several factors
argue against a response-bias interpretation.”). Xia et al paper is also relevant for the discussion on
page 18.
Thank you for bringing this to our attention – the paper sounds very interesting and of particular
relevance for our investigation, and should the paper be made available to us we would be happy to
include the citation where appropriate.
