Seabird diving behaviour reveals the functional significance of shelf-sea fronts as foraging
hotspots
Comments to the editor
The authors have done a good job adding another layer to the study of seabirds and their
association with frontal features. I only have two major comments detailed below. Inclusion of
the codes to compute Fdist, Ffrew, and Gdens, would make this research more reproducible and
suitable for publication in an Open Access journal. I find the paper easy to read, interesting and
would accept it for publication.
Major Comments
I found the discussion of V vs. U shaped dives appeared to imply that V shaped dives were a
better foraging strategy for gannets. A few more details here would be helpful to support this
idea. I can imagine that success rates between the dive types are likely different. Also, it seems
3
possible that U shaped dives could be the result of catching multiple prey items during one dive.
In light of this it might be important to stress in the discussion (paragraph 1) that V shaped dives
dominate the Gannet’s foraging strategy.
From the maps in Figure 1 it looks like there are places that have high Ffreq that are within the
foraging range of the Gannets from Grassholm, but they do not use these areas. Please directly
address this in the discussion.
Inclusion of the codes to compute Fdist, Ffrew, and Gdens, would make this research more
reproducible and suitable for publication in an Open journal.
Minor Points
Methods:
Pg 11, 7-9. The amount of blood taken must be for other analysis and not just for sexing. Saying
‘a small aliquot’ was later used for molecular sexing’ would be less misleading.
Pg 11, 27. Roosting implies a perch.
Pg 12, 8-11. Sentence seems overly long and the second reference to the 2km exclusion zone
could be omitted.

und the discussion of V vs. U shaped dives appeared to imply that V shaped dives were a better
ging strategy for gannets. A few more details here would be helpful to support this idea. I can
gine that success rates between the dive types are likely different. Also, it seems possible that U
ped dives could be the result of catching multiple prey items during one dive. In light of this it might
mportant to stress in the discussion (paragraph 1) that V shaped dives dominate the Gannet’s
ging strategy.
e have added to the methods description of the two dives (section 2.3.3) a sentence that states that
haped dives may be used to catch more than one prey item (see P5 L22-24).
e have also added a sentence (see P11 L 13-15) to state that V-shaped dives dominated the gannet
strategy in this region, and that this was likely reflective of prey types encountered. This was
rted into the first paragraph of section 4.2 of the discussion (as oppose to the beginning of the
ussion) to improve flow and readability, as this section refers specifically to diving behaviour.
so in P11 L22-23 it is highlighted that U-shaped dives may not be well suited to highly responsive prey
es that require an ambush tactic since gannets cannot swim at such high speeds.
m the maps in Figure 1 it looks like there are places that have high Ffreq that are within the foraging
ge of the Gannets from Grassholm, but they do not use these areas. Please directly address this in
discussion.
e have included an additional paragraph that discusses this in section 4.3 of the discussion (P12 L 13-
We believe that the reason for these observations is due to external processes that can influence the
essibility/suitability of habitat locations to individuals (e.g. competition from neighbouring colonies
interfering oceanographic processes such as turbidity). Rather than attempting to include all these
ential mechanisms within statistical analyses (many of which may be unknown), we instead used a
itat-use availability analysis, which included only locations that were selected based on kernel density
mates of GPS tracks (so we know that locations are in fact accessible to individuals).
usion of the codes to compute Fdist, Ffreq, and Gdens, would make this research more reproducible
suitable for publication in an Open journal.
e thank the reviewer for this suggestion, though currently these front metrics are implemented as
dules in a sizeable library of interconnected programs that would not work in isolation; and these are
ten in several programming languages that would not be familiar to the general reader. We refer to
eral other studies that have applied these metrics, indicating that these techniques are robust and
