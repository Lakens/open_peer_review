In this work, the authors synthesized porous NiCo2S4/CNTs nanocomposites via a simple
hydrothermal method and the samples delivered admirable electrochemical performance.
Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with the NiCo2S4/CNTs electrode as
positive electrode and graphene as negative electrode also showed good performance. These
results proved its great potential for application in electrochemical energy storage field. Some
suggestions are as follows:
1. In Fig. 5d, the maximum current density is just 10 A/g. Please measure the rate performance of
electrode materials at higher current density, such as 15 A/g, 20 A/g.
2. In the section of materials and methods, the HMT was used for synthesizing samples. What is
the role of HMT?
3. The asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled with the NiCo2S4/CNTs electrode as positive
electrode and graphene as negative electrode. Please provide the picture of the graphene.

In this manuscript, the authors focused on the bimetallic sulfide (NiCo2S4) nanostructures as a
supercapacitor electrode. The manuscript contains useful information on the effective reagents
for the synthesis of the material and provides various electrochemical properties of the electrode.
Therefore, I think it can be recommended for publication after revision according to the following
comments.
1) The S1 and S2 showed similar morphology as shown in Fig. 3, but quite different BET surface
area of 32.8 and 19.7 m2/g, respectively. The authors mentioned that this difference was due to
3
more porous structure of S1, but I could not find any apparent difference between the SEM
images of S1 and S2. Please provide additional SEM images showing the porosity difference
between S1 and S2 more clearly.
2) As shown in Fig. 5(e), the difference between the Csp values measured at a current density of 1
A/g and 10 A/g is larger for the S1 electrode. I believe that the electrode with higher surface area
has a smaller Csp change with the current density. Please provide the reasons why the S1
electrode showed larger Csp difference.
3) The XRD pattern of the NiCo2S4 film in this manuscript looks similar to that of the Co3S4 film
(JCPDS No. 75-1561). This means that the cobalt sulfide in the NiCo2S4 film is more likely in a
form of Co3S4 rather than CoS. Therefore, I am wondering the redox reactions, especially the
reactions related to CoS, can represent the charge storage mechanism of the NiCo2S4 electrode
properly.
4) As seen in the redox reactions, the reaction of the NiCo2S4 electrode is probably related to the
hydroxide ions in the electrolyte. Therefore, it is worried that the repetitive charge-discharge
process may replace the sulfur atoms in the electrode into oxygen atoms. Please provide
information on the atomic contents of sulfur and oxygen of the electrode after 5000 charge-
discharge cycles.
5) There is no explanation for (c) and (d) in the caption of Fig. 4.
6) In the legend of Fig. 6(a), S1 and graphene are interchanged.

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers comments on our
manuscript entitled Facile Synthesis of NiCo2S4/CNTs
Nanocomposites for High-Performance Supercapacitors (Manuscript
ID: RSOS-180953). Those comments are all valuable and very helpful
for revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding
significance to our researches. We have studied comments carefully
and have made correction which we hope meet with approval. Revised
portion are marked in blue color in the revised manuscript. The main
corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewers comments
list as follows:
Replies to Reviewer 1s comments
Comments 1: In Fig. 5d, the maximum current density is just 10 A/g.
Please measure the rate performance of electrode materials at higher
current density, such as 15 A/g, 20 A/g.
Answer: The reviewer's valuable comments have been adopted. The
rate performance of electrode materials at higher current density has
been added in Figure 5d and Figure 5e in the manuscript. The details
are also presented as follows:
0.6
0.5 15 A/g
20 A/g
0.4
Potential ( V )
0.3
0.2
0.1
0.0
0 10 20 30 40 50
Time ( s )
We also modified the paragraph 4 in the section of the 4.2
Electrochemical properties in the manuscript as follows:
Figure 5d further investigated the discharge times of the S1 samples
at current densities from 1 to 20 A/g. According to the curves, the
specific capacitances of the S1 electrodes are 1765, 1709, 1663, 1623,
1589, 1558, 1507,1460, 1217 and 1153 F/g at the current densities of 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15 and 20 A/g, respectively. Moreover, the
capacitance at 10 A/g corresponds to 82.7% retention relative to 1 A/g.
Figure 5e showed the corresponding specific capacitances versus
discharge current density of the S1 and S2 electrode. Apparently, the
S1 demonstrates the higher specific capacitance than the S2.
Meanwhile, the results reveal that the specific capacitance decrease as
the current density increases, which occurs because the redox reaction
between Ni/Co cations and OH anions is a di<U+FB00>usion-controlled process
through the electrode grain boundaries. However, at a current density
of 20 A/g, the rate capability of the S2 samples was 74.6% retention,
which was higher than that of S1 samples (65.3%).
Comments 2: In the section of materials and methods, the HMT was
used for synthesizing samples. What is the role of HMT?
Answer: The HMT as the alkali hydrolyzing agent plays a crucial role
to promote the formation of the nanosheets.
Comments 3: The asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled with the
NiCo2S4/CNTs electrode as positive electrode and graphene as
negative electrode. Please provide the picture of the graphene.
Answer: Thank the reviewer for the comments. We have added the
picture of the graphene as Figure S5 in the Supplementary Information
and modified the line 3 of the paragraph 7 in the section of the 4.2
Electrochemical properties in the manuscript. The details are as
follows:
To further explore the potential practical application of the S1
electrodes in energy field, an asymmetric supercapacitors (ASC)
device was successfully fabricated with the S1 electrode as the positive
electrode and graphene (Figure S5) as the negative electrode in 2M
KOH electrolyte.

Replies to Reviewer 2s comments
Comments 1: The S1 and S2 showed similar morphology as shown in
Fig. 3, but quite different BET surface area of 32.8 and 19.7 m2/g,
respectively. The authors mentioned that this difference was due to
more porous structure of S1, but I could not find any apparent
difference between the SEM images of S1 and S2. Please provide
additional SEM images showing the porosity difference between S1
and S2 more clearly.
Answer: The reviewers suggestions have been adopted. According to
the additional SEM images, the surface of the S1 sample is more loose
and porous than the S2 sample. We have added the images as the
Figure S6 in the Supplementary Information. We also modified the
corresponding labeling in the manuscript marked in blue color.
Figure S6 SEM image of the S1 (a) and S2 (b)
Comments 2: As shown in Fig. 5(e), the difference between the Csp
values measured at a current density of 1 A/g and 10 A/g is larger for
the S1 electrode. I believe that the electrode with higher surface area
has a smaller Csp change with the current density. Please provide the
reasons why the S1 electrode showed larger Csp difference.
Answer: Thank the reviewer for the constructive comments. In the
process of rapid charge- discharge, the capacitance is not only related
to specific surface area, but also related to the conductivity of
materials. Moreover, the surface area of S1 sample is 32.8 m2/g, which
is quite small compared with other samples. Meanwhile, the reduction
of specific capacitance at high rate can be attributed to the low
diffusion of the electrolyte ion. The ionic motion in the electrolyte is
always limited by diffusion because of the time constraint during the
high-rate chargedischarge process, and only the outer active surface
is utilized for charge storage, so there is an obvious reduction in the
electrochemical utilization of the electroactive materials[1]. In other
words, as the current density increases, electrode polarization becomes
more serious. Therefore, the difference between 1 A/g and 10 A/g is
normal.

conductive NiCo2S4 urchin-like nanostructures for high-rate pseudocapacitors.

Comments 3: The XRD pattern of the NiCo2S4 film in this manuscript
looks similar to that of the Co3S4 film (JCPDS No. 75-1561). This
means that the cobalt sulfide in the NiCo2S4 film is more likely in a
form of Co3S4 rather than CoS. Therefore, I am wondering the redox
reactions, especially the reactions related to CoS, can represent the
charge storage mechanism of the NiCo2S4 electrode properly.
Answer: Thank the reviewer for the comments. The electrochemical
reaction mechanism should be more accurately described as follows:

<U+0001D46A><U+0001D490><U+0001D47A><U+0001D476><U+0001D46F> + <U+0001D476><U+0001D46F>- <U+2194> <U+0001D46A><U+0001D490><U+0001D47A><U+0001D476> + <U+0001D46F><U+0001D7D0> <U+0001D476>+ <U+0001D486>-
The XRD pattern of the NiCo2S4 film in this manuscript looks similar
to that of the Co3S4 film (JCPDS No. 75-1561). This is because they
have very similar crystal structures, both spinel structures, and nickel
and cobalt have very similar atomic radius.
We have mmodified the corresponding part in the manuscript
marked in blue color.
Comments 4: As seen in the redox reactions, the reaction of the
NiCo2S4 electrode is probably related to the hydroxide ions in the
electrolyte. Therefore, it is worried that the repetitive charge-discharge
process may replace the sulfur atoms in the electrode into oxygen
atoms. Please provide information on the atomic contents of sulfur and
oxygen of the electrode after 5000 charge-discharge cycles.
Answer: We have measured the atomic contents of sulfur and oxygen
of the electrode before and after 5000 charge-discharge cycles.
Obviously, the oxygen content increased significantly, accompanied by
a sharp decrease in sulfur content. Therefore, it can be speculated that
sulfur atoms in the electrode may be replaced in the repetitive
charge-discharge process. According to previous experience, metal
sulfides can be slowly electrochemically transformed into whisker-like
metal hydroxides around their exterior surfaces during the repeated
charge-discharge processes in the alkaline electrolyte [2, 3]. Maybe it
is the reason why the oxygen content increased and the sulfur content
decreased in the electrode after 5000 cycles.
