This paper investigates the activity budget of free-living mother dogs and their litters from 3-17
weeks of age. The authors conclude that the mothers budget their maternal care to maximize
their own reproductive output by decreasing active maternal care and increasing passive
maternal care over time and that by regurgitating and provisioning pups they teach the pups
efficient foraging strategies. They also provide a timeline of pup development.
This is a very interesting paper, however there were some major flaws. Primarily, the methods do
not describe much of what is reported in the results including analyses and general data
collection and do not provide enough detail for someone to replicate the study. Also too much is
made of the behaviors that occurred rarely particularly regurgitation and provisioning. While it
is interesting that these behaviors occurred the findings here do not provide solid evidence that
they are evolutionarily important (e.g. regurgitation and provisioning).
There is also some unclear writing, particularly in the discussion of the amount of time spent
engaging in maternal behavior as compared to litter size. That make it difficult to determine what
the authors are claiming.
Finally the importance and connection of the time line presented is unclear and out of context.
Overall, the topic is very interesting and the findings are potentially important contributions to
the scientific literature as research on free-living dogs is definitely needed, but clarification is
required before this paper would be publishable.
Specific comments are provided below:
Abstract
Line 30 the use of the word cleverly suggest that the dogs understand the calculation and are
doing this balance consciously rather than as the result of natural select. I think the same point
can be made clearer by removing “cleverly”
Background
Line 43 an optimal?
Line 45-47 This sentence while important seems out of place perhaps move down so it is the
second to last sentence? ( Line 53)
Line 59 “Care by adults other than the parents has also been reported in cooperatively breeding
species and is probably universal in the family Canidae (12).”
Common but not universal in Canids (Canidae) see Kleiman , 2011
Line 68, “Dogs are a fascinating family of carnivores”
This is confusing because it seems like you are talking about the order Carnivora, and Canidae is
a family within Carnivora, but you are actually talking about the subspecies Canis lupus
familiaris.
Line 72 “Maternal care has been reported to be the predominant care received by the pups (24),
though allo-parental care is also possible (24,25).”
3
It is true that it is possible, but certainly not equivalent to other members of the genus Canis. Both
of these references show quality and frequency of allo-parental care in dogs is greatly reduced as
compared to other member of the genus Canis (See Lord, 2013). This should be made clearer; as
the current statement makes it sound like it can be equivalent in certain circumstances.
Line 73-74
“Pet dogs are mostly supervised by their masters, hence parental care is not an indispensable part
of pups’ survival and development. Indeed, for pet dogs, the pups are separated from the
mothers 75 quite early in their development (22).”
This first sentence is not well supported, and it could be argued that humans caring for pups
before they can eat solid food is extremely time consuming and likely to lead to aspiration
pneumonia if not done by someone experienced in such care. Furthermore if pups do not get
colostrum from mother they are left at higher risk of deadly infection. The point of the following
statement would be made more strongly if the authors focused on the altricial nature of dog
pups, which can be supported in the literature.
Line 78 citing a paper under review is suspect, in press is fine. Why not use Pal 2005 already in
references?
Line 79-81 “Early weaning and a small litter size would be advantageous for the mother only if
pup mortality rates were low, thereby ensuring
her fitness benefits.”
The logic here is not made clear. Why would early weaning being advantageous if she had a
small litter and lower mortality rates? Wolves have smallish litters and lower mortality rates and
have much longer parental care.
References in this section are mostly older than 12 years and all papers within the last 10 years
are by the authors, while some of this is understandable from the lack of literature on free-
ranging dogs, work on other carnivores including wolves and parental behavior in general and in
canids and canis has more recent work.
Methods
Line 95-96 It is not clear what is being observed during these scan and all occurrence sessions, is
it a family group mom and pups, or all mothers and pups in the group? Or just mothers?
Line 90 what are primary denning seasons?
The ethogram in the supplemental materials do not provide clear description of the behaviors
observed but instead too often use the behavior to describe itself E.g. (Play: play with pups)
(see results comments for further missing information).
Provide measure of reliability for behavioral recordings.
Line 93 “Since the pups do not emerge from the dens before the third week of age and the
mother spends most of her time inside or around the dens, it was impossible to carry out
observations on them during this period.”
This needs a reference or if it was attempted to record the pups before three weeks and these
problems were encountered it should be reported.
Results
Line 129-136 And figure 1 a
4
“A 3d surface plot of litter size, pup age and active care revealed that the mothers having small
litters showed the highest amount of active care at the early stages of pup development.
However, for the same age of pups, care decreased with an increase in litter size, suggesting that
the mothers
regulated the investment in active care according to the litter sizes they had to nurture (Figure1a).
Hence pups having fewer siblings tend to receive higher amount of active maternal care at their
early stages of life”
It is not clear if this is saying that total time caring for litter decreases with increased litter size or
the time per pup decreases as litter size increases the text seems to be suggesting the former and
the figure the later? I also believe the later is well supported in other mammals, which you may
want to include in the discussion. If you are reporting per pup as suggested by the figure and
later text in the discussion, it would be important to note whether the total time budget varied.
E.g. Were the mothers providing equal care to all litters or were they showing disproportionate
increases in care to larger litters?
Figure 1 b what unit is the key in? dark red is 25 what? And A& B seem redundant?
Figure 2 I understand dots represent proportion of either active or passive care, but for what? A
mother? A group?
Line 163 how do you know barking is angry?
Starting in line 153 there are a number of results reported for ANOVA’s that are not in the
statistical portion of the methods
Line 172 there is a Two sample t test not included in the statistical portion of the methods.
Methods for collection are not provided for the following measure reported in the results section:
Litter size
Pup age
Specific behavioral definitions (e.g. play, suckling, allo-groom)
Recording of Frequency, duration, order and initiation of behaviors
Maternal preference
Line 187 “Hence the 7th 186
187 week of pup age marks the onset of weaning (Paul and Bhadra, under review).”
Again shouldn’t be referring to paper under review and why are you referring to anything isn’t
this a report from your current findings?
Line 189-190 “However, mothers begin the process of weaning much earlier, i.e. the 5th 189 week
of pup age, by providing regurgitated food to the pups, thereby supplementing suckling and
initiating the pups to scavenged food.”
Are the mothers really doing this at a frequency that could qualify as food supplementation
allowing for weaning? It seems reasonable to bring up that there some possible care may be
occurring infrequently, but the way it is presented here and in the discussion line 199-200 makes
it sound equivalent to other Canis, but in other Canis care from relatives other than the mother
done at a much higher frequency Lord et al. (2013). Nor does it appear that you found that this
extra care has any effect on maternal care.
The development timeline seems like an after thought, it is not clear how it fits in or why it is
important. There needs to be more explanation of this and it connection to past work such as that
of J.P. Scott (Scott and Marston, 1950; Scott and Fuller, 1965) who previously laid out the
5
developmental stages of dogs. Also pup seems unfortunate as a developmental stage, because
this is the term generally used for all dogs that are not adult.
Discussion:
Line 199-200 “However other adults of the group may also invest directly or indirectly in the care
of pups (Paul and Bhadra, under review,(25)).”
Again reference not appropriate unless accepted for publication
Line 216-219 “Hence, while the mothers tried to wean the pups from milk, they also trained them
on solid food, thus providing indirect care in the form of training.”
And
Line 249 “This might help to increase their fitness by providing protection to pups especially
from interfering humans and by helping pups to learn efficient foraging strategies from their
mothers through cultural transmission.”
It is interesting that these behaviors happen on occasion, but there is no evidence for any training
or learning of efficient foraging strategies from regurgitation or provisioning in this data. The
authors say regurgitation and scavenging were an extremely rare occurrence within litters and
were absent in over half of the litters.

General comments
This is an interesting paper that provides further support for the idea that free-ranging dogs still
retain the capacity of living in well structured groups as their wild ancestor, the wolf, does, and
that several features of their behavior still respond to the natural selection pressures that was
working before domestication. The same idea that is supported, in many different aspects of dog
social behavior, in Bonanni et al. 2010a, b; Bonanni et al. 2011; Cafazzo et al. 2010, 2012, 2014).
I found that the paper adds important information on the topic and that it is well written. Thus, I
recommend it for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Minor points
P. 5. A list of behavioural patterns that were collected should be added, specifying which was
taken by mean of All Occurrences method and which during the scan sessions; or they were
mixed together? The description remain quite obscure.
P. 10, lines 193-194 and p. 11, lines 234-236: do the authors have some scientific literature to
support the statement that dogs can be considered sub-adult from the 16th week of age until
sexual maturity? In general, they are considered juveniles until the age of six months.
P. 10, lines 197: What does ‘facultatively’ mean? Also, I wouldn’t say that their social structure is
mostly influenced by their mating and pup rearing needs. An animal can belong to a social
species where the mating system can be monogamy or polygyny or promiscuity. One thing is the
social organization (solitarily versus sociality), another thing is the mating system. And it is the
latter that is influenced by the pup rearing needs: one of the best example is precisely the wolf
because it lives in such a harsh environment that they need to be monogamous to cooperate for
enhancing the probability of offspring survival. So, it is the pup rearing needs that make them
monogamous (even with the need of helpers!)
P. 10, lines 198-199: finally, the basic social unit of a social group of free-ranging dogs does not
consist of A MOTHER and her offspring but, as in lions, as in the domestic cat and in many other
species of mammals, it consists of (kinrelated?) females and their offspring, also during the
denning season.

The methods and writing a much improved, but the ethogram is still not written in a manner that
provides sufficient detail for another group to repeat the study and the finding that dogs are
shifting their active care depending on the size of their litter is not explained in enough detail to
determine if this is a reasonable conclusion or if it is the case that dogs are providing an average
amount of care regardless of litter size and therefore individuals in a smaller litter are receiving
more care than individuals in a larger litter. With the clarifying comments from the authors it
now seems clear that the issue with the pup developmental stage section is that it is really
maternal care stages, rather than the type of stages provided by previously by those like Scott and
Fuller. I think this would be a solid contribution if framed as maternal care stages rather than
pup developmental stages (see more below). I still think this is an important paper with novel
information but it still needs some further work before it is publishable.
Introduction
Line 79-80 “Early weaning and a small litter size would be advantageous for the mother only if
pup mortality rates were low, thereby ensuring her fitness benefits from each litter.”
The logic of this sentence is still confusing. I think you are saying that if pups survived at a high
rate until weaning then small litters and early weaning would be advantageous because all of the
pups would survive. This statement only makes sense if parental care does not effect pup
survival. Further more the figure of 81% provided is for dogs from 0-3 months of age (which is
mostly after the 7 week weaning age you provide in your article). If survival was independent of
parental care (as it is after weaning) then your statement would make sense, but that is generally
not the case. It also does not seem to be an important statement for the rest of the paper. The
important statement seems to be in line 82-84 “On the one hand…” If you are talking about high
mortality before weaning due to reasons unrelated to maternal care then this sentence could
make sense, but it needs a lot more explanation. As is I would suggest removing this sentence
and its follow up. And just stick with line 82-84.

Methods
Line 101 add reference provided in response comments to reviewer Majumder and
Bhadra, 2015 (doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0143501)
The ethogram is improved slightly, but the level of description of the behaviors are not detailed
enough to allow another investigator to replicate the study. See instructions on how to produce
an ethogram e.g.
https://biology.knoji.com/how-to-create-a-usefull-ethogram-a-comprehensive-list-of-animal-
behaviors/
or
Measuring behavior by Martin and Bateson, 2007
Also missing explanation of how initiator was determined for categories where this was included
(e.g. play, nursing, allogrooming)
Inter observer reliability measures sound entirely reasonable from comments, but should still be
included in the methods section of the paper.
Line 141- 145 ANOVAs and t tests now mentioned but the variables tested in these tests should
also be included (as was done with the linear fixed effect model).
Results
Line 152-153-131
“A 3d surface plot of litter size, pup age and active care revealed that the mothers having small
litters showed the highest amount of active care at the early stages of pup development.”
This still isn’t clarified. Is it that mothers having small litters showed the highest amount of
active care per pup or per litter?
From your explanation to previous comments it seems like it should be per pup.
In which case the mothers may just be providing the same total care for each litter and the change
in care is a byproduct of litter size rather than a shift in strategy by the mother, although it could
still mean that smaller litters have lower mortality due to increased care of the individual:
For example a mother could always show 5 hours of active care per day regardless of litter size,
but if she has a small litter of 3 each pup will get more active care than if she has a litter of 10.
Please clarify if this is per pup and if so is there a significant difference in time spent in active care
of litter?
Line 154-155 again clarify if this is care per pup or per litter.
Figure 2 was explained in the comments to reviewer, but not fixed in the figure caption
Line 180 “till” is informal “until” would be better
Same in line 183
Line 186 From your explanation the “angry” is determined by the other behaviors you have
already listed, so simply stating “barking” or “barking followed by growling” would be more
accurate.
Line 206-223
This is still awkward. It is mainly about stages of maternal care rather than changes in pups. I
think this would read a lot better if you framed it that way “stages of maternal care”. Scott and
Fuller based their developmental stages on maturation and behavioral changes in pups such as
15
ability to walk and explore, sensory development. You don’t have this information. You do have
the maternal behavior though and this is valuable, but needs to be framed differently or it
becomes confusing.
Discussion
Line 246-249
If you don’t know it is training (as stated in comments to the reviewer) then this section needs to
be rewritten you currently state that they are being trained in line 247 then say it is possible that
they are learning in the next line. Training necessitates learning. Therefore if you just refer to it
as provisioning and then bring up the possibility of learning it would be much cleaner and not
have to invoke training that implies purposefulness on the part of the mother, which you have no
evidence for.
Line 279-281
“This might help to increase their fitness by providing protection to pups especially from
interfering humans and by helping pups to learn efficient foraging strategies from their mothers
through cultural transmission. “
Why are humans a danger, explain (should be easy give previous paper Paul et al. 2016, just not
made explicit here)?

The paper looks in good shape. Still overlooked a few minor details. The largest of which was to
change the text to reflect to new title of the maternal stages section. In the text you still refer to it
as pup developmental stages. More specifics below:
Missed a till in line 77
Line 79- 81
Makes sense now but have too many on the “other hands.” If you delete the first one and the and
before the second one it will read more clearly
“On the one hand, the mother needs to provide care to ensure survival of her offspring early in
their development, and on the other, she needs to limit care in order to invest in future offspring,
thereby maximizing their lifetime reproductive success.
Line 127
Great, but you left out how interobserver variability was calculated
Line 212-227
“It has been suggested that there are critical periods during the ontogeny of puppies, which affect
the development of social behaviour (Scott 1958, 41). Since parental care contributes significantly
20
to development in early life, we used the changing pattern of the various maternal care
behaviours to draw up a timeline of pup development.”
“Based on our analysis, we divide the developmental phase of a dog’s life into two stages. The
pups receive active maternal care at high rates up to the 6th week of age, and from the 7th to 13th
224 week of age, we see the weaning period, when pups gradually become less dependent on the
mothers. By the 16th 225 week of age, they are completely independent of the mother. Thus the
13th week demarcates the beginning of the juvenile phase of the dog’s life, which is also a period
of active learning and cognitive development.”
Great, that you changed the subheading, the text should also be changed to reflect this is phases
of maternal development and not a pup timeline examples above, but look through whole section
as well as discussion and abstract (e.g. line 29-30),

mments to the Author(s)
s paper investigates the activity budget of free-living mother dogs and their litters from 3-17
eks of age. The authors conclude that the mothers budget their maternal care to maximize their
n reproductive output by decreasing active maternal care and increasing passive maternal care
r time and that by regurgitating and provisioning pups they teach the pups efficient foraging
tegies. They also provide a timeline of pup development.
s is a very interesting paper, however there were some major flaws. Primarily, the methods do
describe much of what is reported in the results including analyses and general data collection
do not provide enough detail for someone to replicate the study. Also too much is made of
behaviors that occurred rarely particularly regurgitation and provisioning. While it is
resting that these behaviors occurred the findings here do not provide solid evidence that they
evolutionarily important (e.g. regurgitation and provisioning).
would like to thank the reviewer for appreciating the premise of our work. We have tried
best to improve the manuscript according to your suggestions.
re is also some unclear writing, particularly in the discussion of the amount of time spent
aging in maternal behavior as compared to litter size. That make it difficult to determine what
authors are claiming.
hope that the revised text will meet with your approval.
ally the importance and connection of the time line presented is unclear and out of context.
have provided the time line to show the developmental milestones of the pups and the
ternal care behaviours that are connected with their development, as there is no such data
sting in the literature for dogs living outside human supervision.
erall, the topic is very interesting and the findings are potentially important contributions to the
ntific literature as research on free-living dogs is definitely needed, but clarification is required

s is an interesting paper that provides further support for the idea that free-ranging dogs still
in the capacity of living in well-structured groups as their wild ancestor, the wolf, does, and
several features of their behavior still respond to the natural selection pressures that was
rking before domestication. The same idea that is supported, in many different aspects of dog
ial behavior, in Bonanni et al. 2010a, b; Bonanni et al. 2011; Cafazzo et al. 2010, 2012, 2014).

mention that we have observed females to mate (and reproduce successfully) as early as the

e-ranging dogs have been observed to forage and rest solitarily except in their mating and
ning seasons. Group composition of a dog group was observed to vary over different mating
denning seasons. While they tend to forage solitarily, they continue to defend territories as
roup throughout the year, and so we have used the term “facultative” to describe their
ortunistic nature either to be or not to be in a group. Please see Sen Majumder et al. 2014

vides sufficient detail for another group to repeat the study and the finding that dogs are
ting their active care depending on the size of their litter is not explained in enough detail to
ermine if this is a reasonable conclusion or if it is the case that dogs are providing an average
ount of care regardless of litter size and therefore individuals in a smaller litter are receiving
re care than individuals in a larger litter. With the clarifying comments from the authors it
seems clear that the issue with the pup developmental stage section is that it is really
ernal care stages, rather than the type of stages provided by previously by those like Scott
Fuller. I think this would be a solid contribution if framed as maternal care stages rather
n pup developmental stages (see more below). I still think this is an important paper with

logic of this sentence is still confusing. I think you are saying that if pups survived at a high
until weaning then small litters and early weaning would be advantageous because all of the
s would survive. This statement only makes sense if parental care does not effect pup
vival. Further more the figure of 81% provided is for dogs from 0-3 months of age (which is
stly after the 7 week weaning age you provide in your article). If survival was independent
arental care (as it is after weaning) then your statement would make sense, but that is
erally not the case. It also does not seem to be an important statement for the rest of the
