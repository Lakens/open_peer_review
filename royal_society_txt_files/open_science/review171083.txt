The manuscript reports the synthesis of talc/NiTiO3 composite at different calcination
temperatures and the characterization and measurement of their properties for electromagnetic
absorption. This is a routine level work to conduct a series of regular experiments, which are
technically supportive for the conclusion. Therefore, based on the criteria of journal, I would
recommend it for publication after addressing the following minor issues.
1) Remove “first time” from the first sentence of the paper, and the conclusion session as well.
2) The term “grape-like balls” is used to describe the NiTiO3 particles, but it does not seem to be
necessary or accurate. It is recommended to just simply use “particles” or “nanoparticles”
throughout the paper.

iew of manuscript: Fabrication and electromagnetic performance of talc/NiTiO3 composite
research is focused on the electromagnetic properties and absorption of talc/NiTiO3.
nthough performances in terms of reflection loss (RL) are lower than some carbon composite wave
orber (e.g. Matter’s Electromagnetic Signature Reproduction by Graded-Dielectric Multilayer Assembly.
lished in: IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques ( Volume: 65, Issue: 8, Aug. 2017 ) ,
result of talc/NiTiO3 composite is a novelty and I recommend a possible publication after e minor
sion.
ow a couple of points:
1) In order to evaluate the EM wave impedance match of for talc, TN 450, TN 550, and TN 650 the
Authors could report a plot of module of = as a function of frequency where µ an e are
those reported in Fig. 5. In this way it could be easy to analyze this aspect of reflection loss. The
Authors can find an example in the following paper: Broadband Electromagnetic Absorbers Using
Carbon Nanostructure-Based Composites. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory
and Techniques ( Volume: 59, Issue: 10, Oct. 2011 ).
2) It could be useful to analyze other contributions to RL. In fact, at nanosize scale losses are due to a
mix of effects: strictly dielectrics but not only. As an example tunneling effects are possobile (see
the following paper: Tunable nanostructured composite with built-in metallic wire-grid electrode.
AIP Advances 3, 112132 (2013); doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4837916). Do the Authors deep
the analysis of EM losses ? in fact the value of permittivity and permeability are quite lower than
conventional carbon based nanocomposites.

Please also include the ethics statements alongside the other end statements. As we cannot publish
your manuscript without these end statements included, if you feel that a given heading is not
relevant to your paper, please nevertheless include the heading and explicitly state that it is not
relevant to your work.
Response: Thanks for your suggestion. We have added the ethics statement session in
our paper (Page 6, Line 199-200). We are sorry for one mistake when we checked the
full paper, and have changed it correctly in the reference part (Page 8, reference 37).

<U+0001D707> <U+0001D707>
the Authors could report a plot of module of <U+03B7> = v 0 v <U+0001D45F> the Authors could report a plot of

module of as a function of frequency where µ an e are those reported in Fig. 5. In this way it could
be easy to analyze this aspect of reflection loss. The Authors can find an example in the following
paper: Broadband Electromagnetic Absorbers Using Carbon Nanostructure-Based Composites.
Published in: IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques (Volume: 59, Issue: 10,
Oct. 2011).;
Response: We have added the EM wave impedance match part in the paper (Page 5,
Line 153-163) and added an intrinsic wave impedance plot as Figure 8, so the original
Figure 8 marked as Figure 9. We have cited this paper as reference 39. The rest
reference number has been changed accordingly. Thanks for the suggestions.
2: It could be useful to analyze other contributions to RL. In fact, at nanosize scale losses are due
to a mix of effects: strictly dielectrics but not only. As an example tunneling effects are possobile
(see the following paper: Tunable nanostructured composite with built-in metallic wire-grid

Authors deep the analysis of EM losses ? in fact the value of permittivity and permeability are
quite lower than conventional carbon based nanocomposites.;
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have added the tunneling effect and
ananlysis of EM losses in the paper (Page 5, Line 138-152). We have cited this paper
as reference 38. The rest reference number has been changed accordingly.
Response to reviewer #2’s comments:
1: Remove “first time” from the first sentence of the paper, and the conclusion session
as well.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have remove “first time” in the
summary (Page 1, Line 2) and conclusion session (Page 6, Line 187).
2: The term “grape-like balls” is used to describe the NiTiO3 particles, but it does not
seem to be necessary or accurate. It is recommended to just simply use “particles” or
“nanoparticles” throughout the paper.
Response: Thanks for your suggestion. We have changed “grape-like balls” as
“nanoparticles” throughout the paper (Page 1, Line3; Page 3, Line 72; Page 3, Line 73;
Page 3, Line 75; Page 6, Line 188).
