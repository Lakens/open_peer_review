"Controllable synthesis of pomelo peel-based aerogel and its application in adsorption of
oil/organic pollutants", reports preparation of oil-absorbing aerogel from a mixture of pomelo
peel and polyvinyl alcohol (or filter papers) with methylsilane treatment. Selective oil absorption
was obtained from an aerogel made of cheap raw materials, and the materials was easily
prepared and cost effective. The structure of the article was reasonable and the experimental
results were discussed in detail and in good agreement with the physicochemical features of the

The paper has shown some interesting results. But there are still some problems I suggest to
solve.
1. The English language should be improved because some sentences cannot be understood
clearly and there are some mistakes in the expression.
2. I suggest the authors characterize the raw material, pomelo peel, so as to make clear the
composition of it.
3. For the Eq. 1.2, please tell us how you obtained the aerogel skeleton density.
4. Are chemical bonds formed during the formation of the aerogels of PSAs and HPSAs? I think
3
more characterization results are needed to show this.
5. The properties of pores are obtained through N2 adsorption-desorption method and only
micropores and mesopores can be analyzed. While I think that maybe macropores are very
important for oil adsorption. So I suggest more characterization on the macropores should be
provide.
6. For the description in Line 8~9, P. 5, “Clearly, the sample was completely absorbed by the dyed
kerosene, otherwise the water in the beaker was not absorbed by the sample”, please describe
how can you determine that there is no water adsorbed.
7. Can you please give results about the strength of the material? And can you please give images
for the aerogels after reusing for many times?
8. Anhydrous ethanol was used in the oil separation. Maybe you can used other solvents consider

The manuscript reported a pomelo peel-based aerogel for oil/organic pollutants adsorption. The
authors used the natural pomelo peel as the starting material, however, the employment of fiber-
contained nature materials as the precursors is not a new topic in this field. Apart from that, I
didn’t see any attractive innovations on both the synthesis and performance. The most
disappointing thing is that the authors did not give any data analysis and academic discussion on
their results. The whole manuscript is more like a experiment report.
In order to improve the current manuscript, I suggest the author place their focus on the
following aspects:
First, improve the architecture of the paper, including the logic and the organization. First come
up a problem, then look back the current researches in this field, finally put forward your
work…..
Then, as for the detail, try to explain the formation of the aerogel and understand the function of
each units in your material. Try to understand the mechanism of the hydrophobic property after
coupling with MTMS. Discuss and compare the advantages and disadvantages of the your
4
aerogels prepared in this paper with other reported works on the synthesis, properties and
oil/organic solvent adsorption capacity. Before doing this, I highly recommend the author to read
more related literatures to make a clear understanding of the current research status.
Finally, please try your best to improve the english writing. I found many sentences that I even
could not understand: “….Different from adding filter paper aerogel, the addition of PVA
aerogels can see a large number of filamentous fiber structure, mainly due to the fiber in the filter
paper is formed by PP fiber [27], the scattered distribution in a suspended solution……The
synthesized sponge aerogels in this work did not reach the superhydrophobic state of the
samples after hydrophobic modification (WCA»150<U+FE12>) [33]asillustrated in the literature, which
was regarded as the main reason for the amount of hydrophobic modification agents. It was
anticipated to use a small amount of MTMS in order to modify the sample to achieve similar
hydrophobic effect…”

In this manuscript the authors investigated oil adsorbent using renewable pomelo peel and filter
paper (or polyvinyl alcohol) via facile method. This biomass-based aerogel shows low density,
high porosity, hydrophobicity, high absorption capacity and excellent recyclability. Based on
these results, this paper is valuable. I recommend accepting this paper after minor revised.
Following is a list of a few to address:
1. In page 1 line 45: author wrote "in situburning", it should be “in-situ burning”. similarly, in
page 2 line 3, “nonocoating” should be “nanocoating”.
2. In page 3, discuss of aerogel microstructure (SEM) should be improved.

Please find the enclosed REVISED version of our manuscript:
Ref. No.:RSOS-181823
“Controllable synthesis of pomelo peel-based aerogel and its
application in adsorption of oil/organic pollutants” and the Response
to the reviewers’ REMARKS
We sincerely thank the Reviewers and the editor for their valuable
comments, which have certainly helped us to further improve the
paper. The changes introduced are marked in red color in the new
version.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Referee: 1
COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR:
Reviewer #1: The manuscript (RSOS-181823), "Controllable synthesis
of pomelo peel-based aerogel and its application in adsorption of
oil/organic pollutants", reports preparation of oil-absorbing aerogel
from a mixture of pomelo peel and polyvinyl alcohol (or filter papers)
with methylsilane treatment. Selective oil absorption was obtained
from an aerogel made of cheap raw materials, and the materials were
easily prepared and cost effective. The structure of the article was
reasonable and the experimental results were discussed in detail and in
good agreement with the physicochemical features of the as-prepared
materials. Based on the results, I recommend the publication of this
manuscript after a minor modification. Following is a list of a few to
address.
1. First of all, this manuscript is required to have consult in terms of
English.
R: We have made a deep correction according to the Reviewer’s
comments. In the new version, many grammatical or type errors
have been revised in order to make it more reasonable and
meaningful for the readers.
2. Why are the pomelo peel and polyvinyl alcohol (or filter paper)
mixed together?
R: We are particularly grateful to the reviewer to help us further
improve the manuscript. Lignocellulosic biomasses that are one of
the important sources of cellulose have recently attracted a great
deal of attention as starting materials for aerogel preparation. But
many researches focused on nanocellulose or cellulose crystals as a
raw material to prepare aerogel. There will bring additional cost
or/and complex process to obtain aerogel. In our work, a facile and
eco-friendly process was used to prepare aerogel and the raw
materials were pomelo peel and filter paper (PVA). The main
component of filter paper was cellulose fiber, and long and soft
cellulose fibers might be used as scaffold in aerogel. The flexible
aerogel was obtained due to a satisfied network structure that
formed by cellulose fibers and pomelo peel closed interaction. PVA
is a water-soluble polymer, it is biodegradable and provide good
properties as toughness and flexibility at relatively low cost.
3. The introduction of this manuscript need improve.
.
R: We are particularly grateful to the reviewer to help us further
improve the manuscript. We have re-written the instruction
according to the Reviewer’s suggestion.
Reviewer #2: The paper has shown some interesting results. But
there are still some problems I suggest to solve.
1. The English language should be improved because some sentences
cannot be understood clearly and there are some mistakes in the
expression.
R: Thanks for the reviewer’s kindly suggestion. We have revised
the paper carefully. Many grammatical or typographical errors,
and incomprehensible sentences were corrected in order to make
this paper more meaningful and reasonable.
2. I suggest the authors characterize the raw material, pomelo peel, so
as to make clear the composition of it.
R: We greatly agreed with the suggestion of the reviewer. In the
revised version, we have characterized the starting material
pomelo peel by FTIR and EDS. The results were shown in Table 3
and Figure 3(a).
3. For the Eq. 1.2, please tell us how you obtained the aerogel skeleton
density.
R: The density of the PVA was 1.27 g.cm-3, according to the
manufacturer’s data sheet. Meanwhile, the density of cellulose
fiber (pretreatment PP and filter paper fiber) was 1.50 g.cm-3
based on previous literature data. We can calculate the aerogel
skeleton density as following:
Aerogel skeleton density (g.cm-3) = 1.5*cellulose fiber
percent content+1.27*PVA percent content
4. Are chemical bonds formed during the formation of the aerogels of
PSAs and HPSAs? I think more characterization results are needed to
show this.
R: During the formation of the aerogles of PSAs and HPSAs, there
were new chemical bond Si-O formed. In this paper, the FTIR and
EDS were used to characterized the samples. The results were
shown in Figure 3 and Table 2.
5. The properties of pores are obtained through N2
adsorption-desorption method and only micropores and mesopores can
be analyzed. While I think that maybe macropores are very important
for oil adsorption. So I suggest more characterization on the
macropores should be provide.
R: We completely agreed with the suggestion of the reviewer. In
this paper, we used SEM technique to indicate macropores of
aerogel sample. In accordance with the SEM images, aerogels
possessed a hierarchical pore structure that led to higher
absorption capacity.
6. For the description in Line 8~9, P. 5, “Clearly, the sample was
completely absorbed by the dyed kerosene, otherwise the water in the
beaker was not absorbed by the sample”, please describe how can you
determine that there is no water adsorbed.
R: We have repeated the experiment. In detail, we put the aerogel
immerse into the water for 20S, then measured the weight of
aerogels. The photograph was presented in support information,
the result revealed that the aerogel could absorbed a little water,
the absorption capacity was 0.33g/g. So, we have corrected this
part.
7. Can you please give results about the strength of the material? And
can you please give images for the aerogels after reusing for many
times?
R: Considering the reviewer’s suggestion, we have investigated the
strength of the aerogel HPSA-1. As shown in Figure S2, the aerogel
exhibited a good mechanic strength. The aerogel could maintain
its shape for a long time under a 200g weight. The images for the
aerogels after reusing for 1, 5 and 10 times were shown in Figure
S4. After 10 cycles, only a little change was observed for the
surface morphology of the aerogel sample, indicating that the
structure of aerogel didn’t destroy in the process of recycle.
8. Anhydrous ethanol was used in the oil separation. Maybe you can
used other solvents consider its future application.
R:We are particularly grateful to the reviewer suggestion. In our
follow-up study, we will try to use other solvents to removal the oil
in aerogel.
In addition, I recommend this manuscript is required to have consult in
terms of English.
R: Thanks a lot for the suggestion of the reviewer, the spelling and
syntax errors have been checked and corrected carefully.
Reviewer:3The manuscript reported a pomelo peel-based aerogel for
oil/organic pollutants adsorption. The authors used the natural pomelo
peel as the starting material, however, the employment of
fiber-contained nature materials as the precursors is not a new topic in
this field. Apart from that, I didn’t see any attractive innovations on
both the synthesis and performance. The most disappointing thing is
that the authors did not give any data analysis and academic discussion
on their results. The whole manuscript is more like a experiment
report.
In order to improve the current manuscript, I suggest the author place
their focus on the following aspects:
1-First, improve the architecture of the paper, including the logic and
the organization. First come up a problem, then look back the current
researches in this field, finally put forward your work…..
Then, as for the detail, try to explain the formation of the aerogel and
understand the function of each units in your material. Try to
understand the mechanism of the hydrophobic property after coupling
with MTMS. Discuss and compare the advantages and disadvantages
of the your aerogels prepared in this paper with other reported works
on the synthesis, properties and oil/organic solvent adsorption capacity.
Before doing this, I highly recommend the author to read more related
literatures to make a clear understanding of the current research status.
R: In the new manuscript, we added more than forty relevant
literatures to exhibit and support our experiment results and
discussion. Especially, we have re-written the instruction
according to the Reviewer’s suggestion, and try to compare the
advantages and disadvantages of our aerogels with other reported
works.
2-Finally, please try your best to improve the english writing. I found
many sentences that I even could not understand: “….Different from
adding filter paper aerogel, the addition of PVA aerogels can see a
large number of filamentous fiber structure, mainly due to the fiber in
the filter paper is formed by PP fiber [27], the scattered distribution in

hydrophobic modification agents. It was anticipated to use a small
amount of MTMS in order to modify the sample to achieve similar

R: We have revised this paper carefully. Many typos, grammatical
errors, and incomprehensible sentences were corrected in order to
make this paper more meaningful and reasonable.

R: We are particularly grateful to the reviewer to point out our
error in expressing. We have corrected the words from “in
situburning” and “nonocoating” to “in-situ burning” and
“nanocoating”, respectively.
2.In page 3, discuss of aerogel microstructure (SEM) should be
improved.
R: In the revised version, we have re-written this part according to
the reviewer’s comments.
3. The title of figure 5 need to correct.
R: The title of Figure 5 was correct in revised paper.
4. The English level of manuscript should be updated by a native
English editor.
R: In line with the suggestion of the reviewer, both the spelling
and syntax errors have been checked and corrected carefully.
