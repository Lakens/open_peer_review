Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The manuscript addresses an important topic and a potential mismatch between what researchers
are doing, and what they perhaps believe they ought to be doing. The aim and theme are very
worthwhile. In general, I would like to see more published on the topic of how science is done
and ought to be done, with contrasts between the two highlighted. However, I find deficiencies in
the execution of the manuscript.
Overall, the tone of this manuscript makes me uncomfortable. Is it a polemic? Is it a review of
literature? Is it a contribution to philosophy of science? I ask, not to reinforce arbitrary
disciplinary boundaries, but because the text has an intermediate level of detail that I find
frustrating as a reader. Concepts are introduced but not sufficiently linked to the literature or to
examples - whether hypothetical thought-experiments or actual published experiments.
I supply a few suggestions, below. I am relaxed about whether the authors follow these specific
suggestions, or choose to increase the depth and rigour of the manuscript in other ways. For
example: re-focusing the text on the empirical study of literature could be another approach.
"Needless to say, exploratory analysis and data mining should be conducted with extra attention
to type I errors." (p. 6)
Is this needless - in which case, does it have to be said at all? My instinct is, it is not needless. But
then, I am left hungry for detail. What type of attention is required (for a "philosophy of science"
essay)? And/or: are there a few references that could be cited, covering this (for a "review
article")? Can something pithy be said about work that gets this wrong (for a "polemic")?
Syllogisms (p. 6). I think the authors' point is, the first syllogism follows from the statements but
one of the statements is false. However, this could be made more explicit.
Conflict between logic and prior knowledge (pp. 6-7). The authors should be more explicit about
whether this is necessarily a problem. They may or may not agree with Stegenga (2013, "Evidence
in biology and the conditions of success", Biol Philos 28:981-1004) - but some reference to
Stegenga's paper, or similar arguments, would clarify and enrich the text.
4
"… a statistical null model is usually generated in opposition to a single hypothesis" (p. 9). This
appears to contradict the author's outline of HWE (p. 8), in which the null model is presented as
being in opposition to six hypotheses. This might be covered by the authors' use of "usually". But
this requires explanation.
"… information-theoretic basis" (p. 9). In context it appears the authors are talking about AIC (or
BIC) - in which case, they should make it clear. Otherwise it is not immediately obvious whether
they mean AIC, or mutual information, entropic priors, or some other approach linked to
information theory.
"The candidate set of models tested … considered in the context of the full set of alternatives” (p.
9). This is intriguing. However, I did not fully understand. The authors should consider
expanding this section, either with a thought-experiment or with reference to an actual study in
biology.
"Null models don't come easily. ..." (pp. 9-10). An explanatory example - again, whether a
thought-experiment or an actual study - is required to clarify the text here.
"The only remedy is to ..." (p. 10). If the authors wish to take a polemical tone, it seems to me this
requires further support from their own text. For a philosophy-of-science angle, it requires deeper
analysis. Or for a review, it requires references to the literature and discussion of those references.
Alternatively, "only remedy" could be rephrased in a less inflammatory way. (Of course:
combinations of these approaches are possible.)
"Good scientists always follow the literature … Forcing oneself to follow other 'schools of
thought' … is vitally important". This paragraph is too light. For example: consider the broader
"sociology of science" angle, in which it may be argued rival scientists with entrenched points of
view contribute to progress of the field as a whole (Hull 1988, Science as a Process)? The authors
may not agree - which is fine - but some attention to this point of view would strengthen the
manuscript.
"We propose that concerted collaboration between opposite sides of the same debate is the only
way one could reach such far-reaching conclusions." (pp. 10-11) As-is, this statement comes
across as false. Major advances in science have been made by researchers not noted for their
collaboration with the opposite side (e.g. RA Fisher, Darwin). The authors' statement is also in
opposition to the thesis of Hull (1988, cited above). The authors might explicitly consider counter-
examples, and/or explicitly delimit the extent to which their proposal applies.
Crowdsourcing (p. 11). This is intriguing and - like the authors - I have not heard of it applied in
ecology and evolution. It would be helpful to outline a thought experiment, showing in principle
how it could work.
"The fallacy of factorial design." (pp. 11-12) There are many questions in ecology and evolution
which cannot be addressed by factorial design, necessarily being based on observations (e.g.
phylogeny, and in general perhaps the evolution of wild populations). Some attention could be
given to these.
"Although not a law, this tension between new and old ideas essentially reflects a conflict
between new and old generations." This is another rather inflammatory statement which requires
further detail, discussion and references to the literature (beyond the single reference cited),
and/or reference to individual cases. Otherwise, counter-examples come to mind (e.g. Lamarck,
who made his most major contributions as an older man).
5
Decision trees (p. 13). Like crowdsourcing (above), this is intriguing but, if included, requires
coverage with further depth. How might a decision tree work for a particular example in ecology
or evolution? How would it compare to a more typical approach?
"... before spending large amounts of money and years in the field." Again, some (hypothetical or
real) example seems necessary here, illustrating the tension between laboratory and field work.
Box 1. The authors should clarify "alternative possible outcomes". For example, for continuous
data (as might be used to estimate a mean), there are - in principle - infinite possible outcomes.
"lacked any clear motivation or hypothesis" (p. 21; also Figure 1 legend). Could this be rephrased
or expanded? It comes across as a negative verdict on the quality of three papers, but without
justification. It occurs to me (without knowing the papers), they might have a strong implicit
motivation that was simply not covered in the paper itself (e.g. a genome sequencing project, to
generate a widely usable resource; other possibilities come to mind).
Citations and/or DOI for the papers analysed in Figure 1 should be included as a spreadsheet or
table as supplementary data. Optionally, I would also like this table/spreadsheet to include the
authors' categorisation of the papers.
Figure 1. Since these bars represent an estimate (being based on a random sample of literature),
some indication of the certainty of results or precision of estimates would be useful - whether in
the figure, legend or text.

Comments to the Author:
The referees have made a number of useful suggestions as to how the manuscript can be revised
in order to strengthen the way the message is put across to readers. One referee, in particular, has
a list of suggestions for the authors to consider, largely relating to the style or tone of the
manuscript and its overall aim. These suggestions should be helpful to the authors and give the
authors a choice in how they want to accommodate the recommendations. It would clearly be
beneficial to accommodate as many of these comments as possible in order to improve the
manuscript.

lieve this is a problem because researchers might judge evidence based on their favourite

ct: The use of multiple working hypotheses to gain strong inference is widely promoted as a
to enhance the effectiveness of scientific investigation. Only 21 of a 100 randomly selected
from the ecological and evolutionary literature tested more than one hypothesis and only 8
more than two hypotheses. The surprising rarity of application of multiple working hypotheses
ts that this gap between theory and practice might reflect some fundamental issues. Here we
y several intellectual biases and practical barriers that discourage us from using multiple
eses in our scientific investigation. While scientists have developed a number of ways to avoid
such as the use of double-blind controls, we suspect that few scientists are fully aware of the
al influence of cognitive bias on their decisions and they have not yet adopted many techniques
le to overcome intellectual and practical barriers in order to improve scientific investigation.
