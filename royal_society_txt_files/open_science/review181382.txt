The paper is a sound, statistically good paper blessed with a good dataset. Although my general
opinion is good, I'm worried by the excessive confidence of the authors in interpreting some
results. I therefore suggest the authors to tone down some such insights, since they appear
standing on thin ice at the moment.
More to the point:
1 You simply cannot control for genetic proximity in wild-caught individuals. How many of them
a young males? do Japanese macaques distribute philopatrically? were sick or old individuals
easier to collect? is there any pregnant female in the wild-caught sample? Please notice this
matters to the evaluation of ecogeographical determinants of body size and body shape variation.
Your result is perfectly reasonable, but all too many potential factors are simply ignored
2 at reading the intro I had the impression that sociality would be carefully scored and evaluated,
but neither of the two. I wonder whether sociality fits anywhere in this manuscript, since it is
either ignored (wild-caughts) or unnatural (captives)
3 the feeding status of captive individuals might be known, but did it vary seasonally? in wild
individuals outside the tropics seasonal variation is the norm
4 being captive probably might elicit reaction norms of some sort, but most phenotypic variation
is known to occur with domestic individuals, not wild-caught or F4 offspring of wild-caughts, so
what is the basic premise of the ms? You have nice data there and a good treatment, and a nice
paper. But I wonder if a better paper might be produced relaxing the basic expectations and
premises (in the intro sections) and narrowing the scope (less sociality, less ecogeography, even
less diet). I'd rather preserve these factors for the discussion, and produce a skinner, more frank
presentation.
Thanks for the opportunity to go through this!

The manuscript deals with an interesting question, namely the impact of captive lifestyle on the
facial morphology of wild animals, here Japanese macaques. The 3D morphometric approach is
up-to-date and appropriate. Based on their analyses, the authors conclude that captive lifestyle
had an important impact on facial shape, presumably because of hormonal changes in conditions
where inter-individual relationships are departing from the wild. This may be an interesting
result that would anyway deserve to be more thoroughly discussed in the background of what is
known in captive representatives of other species (and that is clearly and with extensive citations
presented in the introduction). Unfortunately, some drawbacks limit, in the present form, the
support of the data to this interpretation.
First, a basic presentation of the results, with a PCA, a bgPCA or a CVA, and a plot of the size
across the different populations, would help a lot the reader to get into the data. It would for
instance show rather immediately the amount of variation related to the captive lifestyle
compared to the variation in the wild. What is the amount of allometry in the shape variation?
Second, the analyses with the Bayesian models seem quite sophisticated, but they may suffer of
problems in their design. Mandible change with food consistency has been widely documented,
and it seems rather surprising that the authors do not find any such trend across the wild
populations. What if they analyze wild populations alone? And if they analyze size-corrected
data? Their sampling further includes small islets, where an insular syndrome could develop.
They do not mention such potential sources of variations: as a basis for all other analyses, this has
to be clarify.
Even more importantly, the authors only mention to have assessed the age issue by separating
young (third molar not erupted) and adults (third molar erupted). They do not state when this
event occurs in the animal’s life. It seems anyway a quite basic way to deal with age, in a species
which is presumably rather long lived. Bone remodeling in late life can be quite extensive, and
occur following other directions than the changes occurring in early life (see Swiderski & Zelditch
2013). Therefore, more details and a better control for age is an absolute requirement for assessing
the validity of all results and interpretations: what is the life expectancy of these monkeys in the
wild? What was their age in the captive sampling? When does the eruption of the third molar
occur? What about, once again, the importance and pattern of allometric change? What about the
possible differences in age expectancy between the wild and the captive specimens? This issue
seems all the more important to be clarified than the pattern of shape change related to captivity
(Figure 6) involves a massive change in the relative importance of the molar row compared to the
rest of the mandible. Since molars do not remodel once erupted, a massive plastic change in the
area of the molar row seems unlikely; the observed change is thus mostly an extension of the
ramus, which develops with age. These anatomical aspects have to be discussed more
thoroughly, together with the issue of the age distribution in the two groups, before jumping to
an interesting but hypothetical interpretation.
In more details:
The introduction is well documented but it could contain more details about response to food
consistency and remodeling along the animal’s life, presumably important aspects of the
variation in the wild, and potentially relevant to the difference between captive and wild animals.
The approach to test the angles between vectors of shape change is smart; more references on
similar approaches comparing vectors of shape changes may be welcome. However, testing the
observed angle vs the null hypothesis of complete independence (90 degrees) may provide
somewhat optimistic results. It would be more relevant to test whether the angles are actually
correlated: a value of 67° seems quite a lot to state that the two directions are related. See for
4
instance the approach developed by D. Adams and implemented in the package geomorph.
The number of young vs adult specimens has to be mentioned in the Table 1.
Tables 3 and 4 have to be merged to improve readability.

Dear editors and reviewers,
We are grateful that you have carefully read and provided favorable and constructive
comments on the previous version of this manuscript. We carefully considered and
addressed all the reviewers’ comments. Mainly, both reviewers suggested that we should
carefully interpret the results of wild–captive difference. In accordance with their
suggestions, we mentioned the limitation of this study and discussed more about other
sources of variations. We also performed additional analyses that consider the effects of
age, island, and size. Overall, the comments helped us to expand cautious discussion,
better highlight the validity of results, and to greatly improve the clarity of the text. The
reply to individual comments begins on the next page.
We hope these revisions meet with your approval and look forward to receiving your
response.
Yours Sincerely,
Tsuyoshi Ito,
on behalf of the co-authors

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper is a sound, statistically good paper blessed with a good dataset. Although my
general opinion is good, I'm worried by the excessive confidence of the authors in
interpreting some results. I therefore suggest the authors to tone down some such insights,
since they appear standing on thin ice at the moment.
REPLY: Thank you very much for your favorable and constructive comments to the
manuscript.
More to the point:
1 You simply cannot control for genetic proximity in wild-caught individuals. How many
of them a young males? do Japanese macaques distribute philopatrically? were sick or
old individuals easier to collect? is there any pregnant female in the wild-caught sample?
Please notice this matters to the evaluation of ecogeographical determinants of body size
and body shape variation. Your result is perfectly reasonable, but all too many potential
factors are simply ignored
REPLY: We agree that there are several unobserved factors that potentially impacts on
the mandibular morphology. In answering your question, of 80 males, nine (six captive
and three wild) are young individuals (we added the column showing this information in
Table 1). In Japanese macaques, females usually stay the group of birth but males move
to another group; therefore, adjacent populations are probably admixed due to male-
induced gene flow. Unfortunately, there is no available data about the points you
questioned. In accordance with your suggestions, we discussed such potentially-
confounding factors and carefully interpreted the results (lines 348–368).
2 at reading the intro I had the impression that sociality would be carefully scored and
evaluated, but neither of the two. I wonder whether sociality fits anywhere in this
manuscript, since it is either ignored (wild-caughts) or unnatural (captives)
REPLY: As you questioned, we did not score or evaluate sociality but just discussed the
potential influence of social hormone disturbance on mandibular morphology based on
the captive–wild comparison. To avoid a misreading, we revised introduction to mention
that the present study just compares wild and captive specimens (lines 108–118).
3 the feeding status of captive individuals might be known, but did it vary seasonally? in
wild individuals outside the tropics seasonal variation is the norm
REPLY: The captive individuals in PRI had usually been fed monkey chow and sweet
potato throughout the year. There is no systematic seasonal variation about diet.
4 being captive probably might elicit reaction norms of some sort, but most phenotypic
variation is known to occur with domestic individuals, not wild-caught or F4 offspring of
wild-caughts, so what is the basic premise of the ms? You have nice data there and a good
treatment, and a nice paper. But I wonder if a better paper might be produced relaxing the
basic expectations and premises (in the intro sections) and narrowing the scope (less
sociality, less ecogeography, even less diet). I'd rather preserve these factors for the
discussion, and produce a skinner, more frank presentation.
Thanks for the opportunity to go through this!
Pas
REPLY: In accordance with this suggestion, we refrained from mentioning about
hypothesis in introduction but enhanced discussion by mentioning other potential sources
of variations (lines 348–368). As for domestication, our basic premise is that, the
morphological difference in captive individuals is mostly caused by environmental
(plastic) rather than genetic factors, because our sample consists of at the maximum only
four generations. In the revised manuscript, we also demonstrated that there was no
shape change among generations except for founders (Table S1).

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript deals with an interesting question, namely the impact of captive lifestyle
on the facial morphology of wild animals, here Japanese macaques. The 3D
morphometric approach is up-to-date and appropriate. Based on their analyses, the
authors conclude that captive lifestyle had an important impact on facial shape,
presumably because of hormonal changes in conditions where inter-individual
relationships are departing from the wild. This may be an interesting result that would
anyway deserve to be more thoroughly discussed in the background of what is known in
captive representatives of other species (and that is clearly and with extensive citations
presented in the introduction). Unfortunately, some drawbacks limit, in the present form,
the support of the data to this interpretation.
REPLY: Thank you very much for your favorable and constructive comments to the
manuscript.
First, a basic presentation of the results, with a PCA, a bgPCA or a CVA, and a plot of
the size across the different populations, would help a lot the reader to get into the data.
It would for instance show rather immediately the amount of variation related to the
captive lifestyle compared to the variation in the wild. What is the amount of allometry
in the shape variation?
REPLY: In accordance with this suggestion, we showed the plot of PCA and size across
populations, which is color-coded by environment (captive vs wild) (Fig. S3). As for
allometry, shape (Procrustes coordinates) was slightly but significantly explained by size
(R2 = 0.023, P = 0.048) (lines 212–215).
Second, the analyses with the Bayesian models seem quite sophisticated, but they may
suffer of problems in their design. Mandible change with food consistency has been
widely documented, and it seems rather surprising that the authors do not find any such
trend across the wild populations. What if they analyze wild populations alone? And if
they analyze size-corrected data? Their sampling further includes small islets, where an
insular syndrome could develop. They do not mention such potential sources of
variations: as a basis for all other analyses, this has to be clarify.
REPLY: We agree that size (allometry) and island effect are potential sources of
variations. We had evaluated the effect of allometry by incorporating size as explanatory
factor. We also had performed analyses with wild populations alone and had found that
there were no clear effects of ecogeographic factors (Fig. 8). In the revised manuscript,
to make doubly sure about the control of allometric effect, we reproduced the analyses
with size-adjusted shape data (residuals from the multiple regression of Procrustes
coordinates on size); even in this case, no clear effect of ecogeographical factors was
detected (Fig. S8; lines 271–276). We also reproduced the analyses with island as
explanatory factor and found that temperature may possibly have an effect on mandibular
shape (Fig. S9; lines 276–278). In accordance with the results of these additional
analyses, we discussed the possibility of the influence of temperature on mandibular
variation (lines 313–328).
Even more importantly, the authors only mention to have assessed the age issue by
separating young (third molar not erupted) and adults (third molar erupted). They do not
state when this event occurs in the animal’s life. It seems anyway a quite basic way to
deal with age, in a species which is presumably rather long lived. Bone remodeling in late
life can be quite extensive, and occur following other directions than the changes
occurring in early life (see Swiderski & Zelditch 2013). Therefore, more details and a
better control for age is an absolute requirement for assessing the validity of all results
and interpretations:
REPLY: This issue interests us, because the morphological change after maturation
(third molar eruption) has often been overlooked in the studies of non-human primate
skulls. We addressed this issue as follows.
what is the life expectancy of these monkeys in the wild?
REPLY: Little is known about the life expectancy in the wild. A handful of studies reported
that the life span varies across populations; that of females (mean ± SD) is 6.3 ± 5.2
(Yakushima, nonprovisioned natural population), 8.4 (Takasakiyama, provisioned
natural population), and 13.6 ± 0.4 (Arashiyama, provisioned natural/semi-natural
population) (Fooden and Aimi, 2005). The greatest accurately known life span in
Japanese macaques are 33 years in a female in a provisioned natural group and 28 years
in a male another provisioned natural group (Fooden and Aimi, 2005).
What was their age in the captive sampling?
REPLY: In the captive specimens of known ages, age ranges from 6.4 to 29.5 years (mean
± SD: 14.0 ± 5.7) (lines 137–138).
When does the eruption of the third molar occur?
REPLY: In the captive specimens of known ages, the individuals with fully erupted third
molars (adults) were observed in 8.1 years of age or more (lines 139–140). To rule out
the variation between young adult and adult specimens, we reproduced the analyses with
restricting the sample to the adults with fully-erupted third molars (lines 221–222). Even
in this case, significant captive–wild difference was detected (Fig. S7; lines 258–259).
What about, once again, the importance and pattern of allometric change?
REPLY: To make doubly sure about the control of allometric effect, we reproduced the
analyses with replacing the size-adjusted shape data with response variables (lines 211–
215). Even in this case, significant captive–wild difference was detected (Fig. S4; lines
255–256).
What about the possible differences in age expectancy between the wild and the captive
specimens?
REPLY: Common sense would say that captive individuals can possibly live longer on
average than wild individuals (although it is not necessarily the case because the captive
individuals of PRI are sometimes used for experimental research). Considering the
reported life span in natural populations (see above comments), individuals older than
20 years of age are considered to be very rare in wild samples. To address this issue, we
reproduced the analyses with removing the old-aged captive individuals (20 years of age
or more) (lines 217–220). Even in this case, significant captive–wild difference was
detected (Fig. S6; lines 257–258).
This issue seems all the more important to be clarified than the pattern of shape change
related to captivity (Figure 6) involves a massive change in the relative importance of the
molar row compared to the rest of the mandible. Since molars do not remodel once
erupted, a massive plastic change in the area of the molar row seems unlikely; the
observed change is thus mostly an extension of the ramus, which develops with age.
These anatomical aspects have to be discussed more thoroughly, together with the issue
of the age distribution in the two groups, before jumping to an interesting but hypothetical
interpretation.
REPLY: We assume that the captive–wild difference in mandibular morphology was
formed not after maturation (the eruption of third molars) but during development
(particularly in adolescent). In fact, we showed that there is no significant shape change
(in PC4 and shape score) after maturation (lines 259–261). In adolescence (three to five
years of age), canines, premolars, second and third molars are not erupted or under
eruption. As the reviewer #2 pointed out, it is unlikely that the size of each tooth changes.
Therefore, we consider that the observed changes possibly reflect the remodeling of both
mandibular body and ramus. In accordance with the reviewer#2’s suggestion, we
discussed more about the anatomical aspect of this change (lines 331–333) and about the
issue of the age distribution (lines 349–361).
In more details:
The introduction is well documented but it could contain more details about response to
food consistency and remodeling along the animal’s life, presumably important aspects
of the variation in the wild, and potentially relevant to the difference between captive and
wild animals.
REPLY: In accordance with this comment, we added the description about response to
food consistency (lines 63–64) and remodeling along animal’s life (lines 356–360).
The approach to test the angles between vectors of shape change is smart; more references
on similar approaches comparing vectors of shape changes may be welcome. However,
testing the observed angle vs the null hypothesis of complete independence (90 degrees)
may provide somewhat optimistic results. It would be more relevant to test whether the
angles are actually correlated: a value of 67° seems quite a lot to state that the two
directions are related. See for instance the approach developed by D. Adams and
implemented in the package geomorph.
REPLY: In accordance with this comment, we cited reference that used similar approach
comparing vectors (Pitchers et al. 2013). We also added the plot of correlations between
vectors (Fig. 7b).
The number of young vs adult specimens has to be mentioned in the Table 1.
REPLY: In accordance with this comment, we mentioned the number of young adult and
adult specimens in Table 1.
Tables 3 and 4 have to be merged to improve readability.
REPLY: We merged Tables 3 and 4 accordingly.
Please supply legends for the supplementary figures.
REPLY: We supply legends for the supplementary figures accordingly.
The comments annotated on the attached PDF:
is this relevant? just delete (on about the following sentence: “Because of this, Japanese
macaques are also beginning to attract the attention of researchers as an analogy for
cold 90 adaptation in humans [40].”)
REPLY: We deleted this sentence accordingly.
isn’t ontogeny a big neglected factor here? (on about the following sentence: “The
individuals with smaller PC scores (i.e. smaller individuals or males rather than females)
tended to be squared-jawed (laterally positioned gonions) with a more posteriorly inclined
ramus [Fig. 4(c)]. PC5–10 were not significantly explained by any explanatory factors.”)
REPLY: PC3 is not explained by age class, and therefore it is unlikely that this is
ontogenetic variation.
how can you tell? (on about the following sentence: “In Japanese macaques, the
nutritional conditions of captivity were unlikely to have been so markedly different from
natural conditions as to have influenced the growth of the body or mandible.”)
REPLY: We recognized that this sentence was overgeneralized. In the revised manuscript,
we mentioned only about size here (lines 287–290). We also corrected all the editorial
issues annotated on the PDF.
Appendix B

Dear editors and reviewers,
I am grateful that you have carefully read and provided favorable and constructive
comments on the previous version of this manuscript. In accordance with the reviewer’s
comments, I revised the manuscript as follows. The reply to the comments begins on the
next page.
I hope these revisions meet with your approval and look forward to receiving your
response.
Yours Sincerely,
Tsuyoshi Ito,

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors downplayed the eccessive confidence in their data and frankly admit there
are factors they were not in the position to control that could be important. Some few
statements, especially in the closing lines, are still at odds with their data and results, and
the language deserves further attention. I have nonetheless annotated the ms throughout
to make this easy. I wish the author will appreciate this effort.
Author’s response: Thank you very much for kindly annotating our manuscript
throughout. This was very helpful to make the text clear. I revised the manuscript in
accordance with all the edits. The reviewer also made three questions. The answers to
these are as follows.
The reviewer’s question: do you mean from ten different populations in the wild?
Author’s response: The individuals came from ten different natural provisioned or non-
provisioned populations. In the revised manuscript, I added the text explaining this (line
123).
The reviewer’s question: it 8.1 is the age of the youngest with M3, how comes your
sample of captives starts at 6.4?
Author’s response: Adults with fully erupted molars are 8.1 years old or more. The
samples of young adults with almost erupted molars include the individuals with less than
8.1 years old (e.g. 6.4 years old individual).
The reviewer’s question: please check, it looks like females are the larger sex…
Author’s response: As the reviewer indicated, this is confusing result. I consider that this
may be the consequence of multicollinearity between size and sex, because the two
variables are highly correlated to each other (r = 0.75) and because, when removing one
of the two variables, the effect of the other became insignificant (Figures S4 and S5). I
revised the text to make this clear (lines 231–234, 305–306). In related to this, I noticed
that the shape visualizations along principal components in Figure 4 were in opposite
direction. I fixed Figure 4 and accordingly revised the relevant parts of the text (lines
225–226). This does not affect our conclusion.
