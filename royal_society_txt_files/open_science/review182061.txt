This is a generally well-thought out paper that ties fundamental hydraulic understanding and
experiments to a practical problem, achieving better conditions in an aquaculture pond. I make
extensive comments and suggestions in the attached pdf (Appendix A) for the authors'
consideration. In my opinion, the research is well justified, novel, and worthy of publication once
language editing is complete, and the authors address these general questions/comments/concerns:
1) Depth as described in the paper is a bit confusing, since it is measured from the bottom, which
is the opposite of its meaning. I suggest teh authors check its use, and provide a bit more
clarification so as to not confuse readers.
2) If possible, could each of the figures contain the legend on the figure/plot itself?
It would be easier for the reader.
3) In several cases, flow and velocity were interchanged, in most cases, I believe velocity is the
appropriate term and was selected in the pdf. Please check and comment.

The study describes an interesting work on the influence of aeration plug flow device on the
hydrodynamics of an in a pond raceway system. The work is experimental and an ADV has been
used to obtain the mean & fluctuating velocities. The concerns are as follows.
3
1. The studies are specific to the system considered. It detects the primary & secondary flows but
does not highlight the physics of flow. I am not sure how the results can be extended to other
systems / in different geometry and/or different dimensions of the pond. In short I could not
appreciate the novelty of the study and/or the generality and applicability of the results.
2. It is expected that aeration will produce secondary flow, but how is this information going to
be useful in optimizing design of raceway ponds.
3. The ADV is also expected to disturb the existing flow. How does the author correlate the
obtained flow characteristics with the actual flow characteristics expected in a pond.
4. There are several grammatical errors which makes understanding & appreciating results
difficult. The paper has to be rewritten in correct English.
5. The hole dimension is not mentioned in experimental description
6. What does plug flow mean? This needs to be described as plug flow in multiphase flow
denotes a completely different flow pattern.
7. How do the aeration orifices close by themselves? The mechanism is not clear from text.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
The remaining comments from the reviewer are largely concerning the quality of the writing,
which is a little disappointing to see, as this review also commented on the language in the first
round of review: the authors should have responded better to this.
Nevertheless, as the reviewers seem to be largely satisfied that the paper is scientifically ready for
acceptance, the Editors will be willing to accept the paper IF - and this is stressed - if the authors
seek professional language advice: https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/language-
polishing/.
The authors will be required to provide evidence that such advice has been sought, in addition to
the full point-by-point response to the reviewer's commentary.
Please ensure you seek the required advice.

20
21
22
9 aquaculture mode coping with continuous consumption of water and land resources,
23
24
10 which is widely used in many countries and regions. Water flow and dissolved
25
26 11 oxygen (DO) are two important conditions for aquaculture. Several alterations are
27
28 12 made in the system design and the operational procedures to increase the water
29
30 13 exchange and the DO concentration in the IPRS. The IPRS with aeration plug-flow
31
32 14 device (APFD) is commonly used in China, where the APFD is the only stimulus for
33
34 15 pushing water recirculation in an aquaculture pond. In order to further improve the
35
36 16 design of the IPRS with APFD and to promote a novel intensive aquaculture mode,
37
38 17 designers or farmers require comprehensive knowledge about the hydrodynamics in
39
40 18 this system. The indoor experimental studies were performed and the
41
42 19 three-dimensional velocities were measured by using an Acoustic Doppler
43
44 20 Velocimeter. The patterns of velocity and the turbulent characteristics were obtained
45
46 21 and the plug-flow characteristics were analyzed. The results showed that the patterns
47
48 22 of the velocity and the turbulence in the horizontal sections were divided into two
49
50 23 parts. At one of parts there were plug-flow and the reflux and the value was higher
51
52 24 and increased with depth from bottom, while at the other part the flow was mostly
53
54 25 plug-flow and the distributions were uniform. Secondary flows were observed in both
55
56 26 the horizontal and cross sections, which were beneficial to the diffusion of materials
57
58 27 and the retention of DO. The system effectively self-circulated and the plug-flow
59
60 28 capacity can be converted to a commercial scale to meet the general requirements.

7 30 1 Introduction
8
9 31 As China’s economy and aquaculture is developing rapidly, China has become
10
11 32 the world’s largest producer and consumer of aquaculture products [1,2]. The
12
13
33 continuous consumption of farm and water resources inevitably accompanies this, so
14
15
34 intensive aquaculture plays an important role among the variable strategies for
16
17
18
35 replacing the shortage of resources. The current traditional intensive aquaculture is
19
20
36 gradually exposing a series of problems, such as higher ammonia and nitrogen
21
22 37 concentration [3], water waste, water pollution [4], and recurrent fish diseases [5].
23
24 38 The aquaculture water body is the living place for fish, as well as the decomposition
25
26 39 site of feces, baits, and the cultivation pool of plankton, so the function division of the
27
28 40 consumer, the producer, and the decomposer in aquaculture ponds remains unclear,
29
30 41 making the management difficult and ecological imbalance inevitable [6]. An
31
32 42 advanced aquaculture mode is required, where the ecological function zones remains
33
34 43 independent. The fish production will improve and the water quality will be purified.
35
36 44 In 2005, Chappell in Auburn University and a farmer invented an in-pond
37
38 45 raceway system (IPRS) cooperatively [7], which is a simplified version of the
39
40 46 partitioned aquaculture system (PAS) that originated from Clemson University [8,9].
41
42 47 The basic principle of the IPRS is to build several aquaculture raceways in a pond.
43
44 48 The breeding area and the purification area become isolated, where the raceways
45
46 49 continue to provide “captivity” to the feeding fish, and the purification area provides a
47
48 50 home for some filter-feeding fishes and grows aquatic organisms [7-10]. In this mode,
49
50 51 it is easier to control fish excrement during the aquaculture period. By adding pumps
51
52 52 and waste collection equipment, the excreta and residual feed accumulates in the
53
54 53 downstream purification area for easier collection. The initial purpose of the IPRS is
55
56 54 to improve the catching rate [10,11]. This mode also suitable for the countries or
57
58 55 regions where high land use costs or environmental pressures exist [9,12]. The USA
59
60 56 has 12 large aquaculture fields using this farming mode [13]. In 2013, Zhou, who was
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 3 of 30 Royal Society Open Science: For review only

2
3
4 57 working in the United States Soybean Association (USSA), introduced this mode into
5
6 58 China, which was then extended to Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai, and other places (Chen,
7
8 59 2014). The IPRS has been extended to more than 18 provinces and cities with an
9
10 60 aquaculture area of 200,000 m2 in China.
11
12 61 In IPRS, the water flow is one of the important environmental factors that affect
13
14 62 the behavior of fish. It stimulates the sensory of fish organs, produces the
15
16 63 corresponding reaction mechanism [14-17], and even generates behavioral variability
17
18 64 within a species in response to the velocity and turbulence [18]. The turbulence plays
19
20 65 a critical role in the transport and dispersal of excreta, nutrients, and pollutants in the
21
22 66 flow [19,20]. Dissolved oxygen (DO) is an indispensable factor in aquaculture ponds.
23
24 67 When DO concentration in the water body is less than 5 mg/L, fish will exhibit lazy
25
26 68 behavior, no-intaking bait, and head floating, possibly even suffocating, resulting in
27
28 69 significant economic losses [21-23]. In IPRS, one or more high-power water pumps

30 70 are used to pump water into the raceways. The water then flows out the raceways and
31
32 71 into the purification area, which circulates the water flow. The water body in the
33
34 72 raceways maintains 24 hours of movement, forming an artificial movement
35
36 73 environment for the fish. After several additional alterations were made in the system
37
38
74 design and the operational procedures, the water exchange and DO concentration
39
40
75 increased in the IPRS. An IPRS (Fig. 1) with aeration plug-flow device (APFD) was
41
42
43
76 designed by some farmers in China, where the APFD primarily includes a curved
44
45
77 baffle and a set of micro-bubble tubes. The APFD is fixed on the inlet of the raceway
46
47 78 and the micro-bubble tubes submerged in a certain depth of water, so that the air
48
49 79 through the external compressor is pumped into the micro-bubble tubes, resulting in
50
51 80 micro-bubbles floating into water. The floating micro-bubbles are blocked by the top
52
53 81 of the curved baffle and forced to change their original floating path, which causes the
54
55 82 water current to flow from the bottom to the top, from the raceway inlet to the outlet,
56
57 83 and finally to the purification area. This forms a recirculating flow in the IPRS, and
58
59 84 mass transfer between the interface of the micro-bubbles and the water takes place, so

4 85 that the DO concentration increases in the water. The IPRS with APFD enables water
5
6 86 recirculation in an aquaculture pond and supplies DO to the water at the same time,
7
8 87 making it increasingly popular in many Chinese aquaculture ponds. However there is
9
10 88 a lack of sufficient research exploring not only the effects that APFD has on the
11
12 89 hydrodynamic characteristics in raceways, but also the plug-flow capacity of the
13
14 90 APFD in IPRS. Farmers often use IPRS with APFD blindly. There is confusion about
15
16 91 how the hydrodynamics are in raceways under a certain air flow rate and how to set
17
18 92 up or improve this device more efficiently. At some sites, the water recirculation
19
20 93 velocities or turbulence exceed the preferable conditions for fishes, which could
21
22 94 compromise fish production. In order to understand the response of the
23
24 95 hydrodynamics to the APFD in raceways, we designed an indoor physical model of
25
26 96 the IPRS with APFD, regulated an aeration flow rate, performed a series of velocity
27
28 97 measurements in the raceway, analyzed the distribution of velocity and turbulence,
29
30 98 and at last calculated the plug-flow capacity of the APFD. This study could provide a
31
32 99 reference for future optimization design of the IPRS and promote the new intensive
33
34 100 aquaculture model.

6 104 2.1 The aeration plug-flow device (APFD)
7
8
9 105 A detailed structure of the APFD is shown in Fig. 2. There is the framework (1),
10
11 106 an aeration device (2), and an arc-shaped baffle (3). The aeration device included a
12
13 107 gas pipes group (4) and a micro-bubble generating tubes group (5). One pipe in the
14
15 108 gas pipes group was composed of an air inlet hole (6) and a gas transmission pipe (7).
16
17 109 The micro-bubble generating tubes group included tee pipes or adapters (8), five
18
19 110 micro-bubble generation tubes (9), and gas nozzles. The gas nozzles were connected
20
21 111 together to the tee pipes or adapters through the internal thread.
22
23 112 The width of the APFD was exactly the same as the width of the raceway. The
24
25 113 APFD was fixed at the inlet and near the bottom of the raceway, air pumped by an
26
27 114 external air compressor passed through the air inlet hole (6), the gas transmission pipe
28
29 115 (7), the tee pipes or adapters (8), the gas nozzles, and eventually reached the
30
31 116 micro-porous aeration tubes (9). This generated a large number of tiny bubbles
32
33 117 floating from the bottom.

4 123 Fig.3 shows the actual appearance of the micro-porous aeration tubes. The
5
6 124 aeration tubes were made of a nano-polymer material with stable physical and
7
8 125 chemical properties, with outer and inner diameters of 15mm and 10 mm. The surface
9
10 126 of the aeration tube had a number of tiny holes, with a density between 700 to 1200
11
12 127 holes per meter length. Once the air was pumped into the aeration tube, the increased
13
14 128 air pressure opened the aeration orifices; otherwise they shut off by themselves. The
15
16 129 designed orifices could effectively avoid clogging by sediments or dusts. The air
17
18 130 bubbles produced from this aeration tube were small enough to enhance the total
19
20 131 contact area between the air bubbles and the water.

43 134 2.2 The indoor in-pond raceway system(IPRS)
44
45 135 Fig. 1 shows that our indoor IPRS model consisted of three APFDs, three
46
47 136 aquaculture raceways, and a purification area. The four sides and the bottom of the
48
49
137 model were reinforced by concrete. The size was 370cm×310cm×75cm (length ×
50
51
138 width × height) and the concrete wall thickness was 10cm and higher than the water
52
53
54
139 level, which ensured the water did not overflow. There was a walkway to facilitate the
55
56
140 experimental operation in between the two raceways.
57
58 141 The equipment and size of the raceway are shown in Fig. 4. The size of each
59
60 142 raceway was 220cm×30cm×40cm (length × width × height). Each raceway was made

3
4 143 of plexi-glass, where the entrance and exit of the raceway both connected with the
5
6 144 purification area (Fig. 1). The APFD is the only impetus for the circulatory system
7
8 145 and was installed at the forefront of the raceway and fixed 10cm from the bottom of
9
10 146 the raceway.
11
12 147 After turning on the air compressor and adjusting the pressure and air flow rate,
13
14 148 the micro-porous aeration tube continued to produce a large number of floating
15
16 149 micro-bubbles from the bottom. When the bubbles were subjected to the obstruction
17
18 150 of the upper arc-shape baffle, they were forced to change the original floating path,
19
20 151 flowing out from the front of the curved baffle, while influencing other floating
21
22 152 bubbles to change their path (shown in Fig. 4b). The APFD caused the air bubbles to
23
24 153 flow from the bottom to the surface, from the inlet to the outlet of the raceway, which
25
26 154 drove the water to move through the aquaculture raceway, passing through the
27
28 155 purification area, and returning to the inlet of the raceway. As shown in the red arrows
29
30 156 of Fig. 1, the water of the entire system circulated clockwise.

163 2.3 Flow velocity measurement
4
5
6 164 This research focused on the response of the APFD on the hydrodynamics in
7
8 165 IPRS, so the fishes were not bred in the raceway to avoid influencing the
9
10 166 hydrodynamics. The three parallel raceways had similar flow fields, so just one of the
11
12 167 raceways was chosen for measurement.
13
14 168 Measurements of the 3D velocities were conducted via Nortek Acoustic Doppler
15
16
169 Velocimeter (ADV) and we designed a custom displacement device. The
17
18
170 displacement device comprised of a base, a sliding rod, a lifting rod, and a fixing part
19
20
21
171 (Fig. 5). The ADV was mounted on the fixing part and could slide freely along the
22
23
172 longitudinal, transversal, and vertical directions of raceway to measure any point in
24
25 173 the water.

176 The direction of the ADV probe affected the Reynolds stress and the secondary
41
42
177 flow, so to minimize the error from the probe, the positive direction of the probe was
43
44 178 in the positive direction of the x-axis. The x direction was parallel along the raceway;
45
46 179 the z direction was vertical along the ADV rod; the y direction was determined by the
47
48 180 right hand law and was 90°angle with x direction (Fig. 6).
49
50 181 Referring to the division of the water in open-channel shear flow into three
51
52 182 regions studied by Nezu and Nakagawa [24,25] and considering our experimental
53
54 183 conditions, sets of measurements in depths from the bottom z=5 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm, 20
55
56 184 cm, 25 cm, and 30 cm were collected, with relative depths of 0.15, 0.29, 0.44, 0.59,

7
8 188 a grid of 72 points (Fig. 6), and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was maintained at 15

4
5
6 195 To ensure the authenticity of the measured data, the data where the correlation
7
8 196 coefficient was less than 80% were eliminated. About 2000 valid data at each point
9
10 197 were taken to calculate.
11
12 198 Instantaneous 3D flow velocity components were acquired at each measurement
13
14 199 point using the ADV. The measurement data in the longitudinal, the lateral, and the
15
16 200 vertical directions were denoted as <U+0001D462><U+0001D456>, <U+0001D463><U+0001D456>, and <U+0001D464><U+0001D456>. The instantaneous velocity was
17
18
201 divided into the mean velocity and the fluctuating component, as shown in the Eq. (1).
19
20
202 <U+0001D462><U+0001D456> = <U+0001D462> + <U+0001D462><U+0001D456>' (1a)
21

203 <U+0001D462><U+0001D456>' = <U+0001D462><U+0001D456> <U+2015><U+0001D462> (1b)
23
24
25
204 where <U+0001D462><U+0001D456> is the instantaneous velocity, <U+0001D462> is the mean velocity, and <U+0001D462><U+0001D456>' is the
26
27 205 fluctuating velocity. The mean velocity <U+0001D462> was obtained by Eq. (2).
28 1 <U+0001D441>
29 206 <U+0001D462> = <U+0001D441><U+2211><U+0001D456> <U+0001D462><U+0001D456> (2)
30
31 207 where N is the number of valid data. The turbulence strength of the longitudinal
32
33
208 velocity was defined as:
34
35 1 <U+0001D441> 1 <U+0001D441>
36 209 <U+0001D462>' = <U+0001D462><U+0001D456>'2 = <U+2211>

<U+0001D441> <U+0001D456> <U+0001D462><U+0001D456> <U+2015> <U+0001D462>)2 (3)
37
38 210 Similar definitions applied to the lateral and vertical velocities <U+0001D463><U+0001D456> and <U+0001D464><U+0001D456>.
39
40 211 The turbulent shear stress (i.e., Reynolds shear stress) were calculated as:
41
42 212 <U+0001D70F><U+0001D462><U+0001D463> = |<U+0001D462>'<U+0001D463>'|, <U+0001D70F><U+0001D462><U+0001D464> = |<U+0001D462>'<U+0001D464>'|, <U+0001D70F><U+0001D463><U+0001D464> = |<U+0001D463>'<U+0001D464>'| (4)
43
44 213 where <U+0001D462>'<U+0001D463>', <U+0001D462>'<U+0001D464>', and <U+0001D463>'<U+0001D464>' are the covariance of instantaneous fluctuating
45
46 214 velocity.

51 216 <U+0001D458> = 2(<U+0001D462>' + <U+0001D463>' + <U+0001D464>' ) (5)

4 220 energy were derived from the ADV measured data. The APFD induced the water flow
5
6 221 to move from the bottom to the surface, from the inlet to the outlet of the raceway, so
7
8 222 we were primarily concerned about the velocity patterns in the horizontal sections and
9
10 223 the cross-sections.
11
12
13 224 3.1 Velocity patterns in horizontal sections
14
15
225 The schematic diagram of various parts in horizontal section is shown in Fig.
16
17
18
226 7(i), where the sections of x=-40 and x=180 were the inlet and the outlet. For the
19
20
227 convenience of the following description, x=0-120 was defined as the fore-mid part
21
22 228 and x=120-185 was defined as the rear-part.
23
24 229 As shown in Fig. 7(ii), the flow velocity patterns in horizontal sections were
25
26 230 plotted where (a)-(f) represented the distributions of velocity at different depths z=5,
27
28 231 10 cm, 15 cm, 25 cm, and 30 cm. The velocities at the baffle were corrected to zero.
29
30 232 The color indicated the velocity value of u+v, the blue vector arrows indicated the
31
32 233 direction of u+v, the gray dotted lines denoted the isoline of u+v=0, and the shaded

4 249 Fig. 7 (ii) shows that the flow in the raceway was divided into plug-flow (u+v>
5
6 250 0) and the reflux (u+v<0), where the gray dotted lines were the boundary lines. The
7
8 251 range of the reflux and the area proportions between the plug-flow and the reflux are
9
10 252 listed in Table 2. The range of reflux extended to about x=100, and the area ratio was
11
12 253 about 6:4. In the plug-flow area, the water was pushed through the raceway for
13
14 254 self-circulation, while the reflux contributed to retaining the DO in the aquaculture
15
16 255 unit for fish consumption.

33 257 At each depth, the patterns at the fore-mid part (x=0-120cm) and the rear part
34
35 258 (x=120-180cm) were distinct (Fig. 7). The plug-flow and the reflux interacted at the
36
37 259 fore-mid part. The velocity was generally higher than the rear part. There were two
38
39 260 cores of high velocities distributed at the fore-mid part, which were encircled by the
40
41 261 diminishing velocities and separated on two sides of the raceway. The two cores
42
43 262 formed by the different effects: the red core was formed by the plug-flow and the blue
44
45 263 one was formed by the reflux. At the rear part, the velocity was relatively uniform,
46
47 264 mostly showing the plug-flow effect, and the strength did not change much with
48
49 265 depth. The velocities at the fore-mid part varied obviously with depth and the changes
50
51 266 were mainly reflected in the movement of the high velocity cores, the magnitude of
52
53 267 velocity, and the reflux range.
54
55 268 At the depth near bottom (z=5), the reflux zone was near the APFD, while
56
57 269 plug-flow zone was slightly behind. The plug-flow effect generally began at x=10.
58
59 270 When approaching the water surface, i.e., at z=25, another plug-flow zone appeared at
60

2
3
4 271 the position of APFD. Until z=30, the two plug-flow zones developed and connected
5
6 272 together, showing that the pattern that the plug-flow zone was near the APFD while
7
8 273 reflux zone was the latter. From the bottom to the water surface, the velocity of the
9
10 274 plug-flow and the reflux at the fore-mid part gradually increased, but the enlargement
11
12 275 of reflux was less than the plug-flow. The reflux range at z=10 was the shortest
13
14 276 among the measured depths (Table 2), even shorter than the range at z=5, which was
15
16 277 below the installation height of the APFD. Above the installation height, the reflux
17
18 278 range gradually increased at depths of z=15-25 and reduced to about 100 cm at z=30.
19
20 279 At depths of z=10 and 30, the area ratio between the plug-flow and the reflux was
21
22 280 closed to 7:3.
23
24 281 The blue vectors represented the patterns of the secondary flows that occurred at
25
26 282 each depth (Fig. 7). The secondary flow patterns was divided into the two parts and
27
28 283 their rotation directions were opposite, i.e., at the fore-mid part, the water flow rotated
29
30 284 counterclockwise and at the rear part it rotated clockwise. The vectors showed that as
31
32 285 the depth from the bottom to the surface, the secondary flow cell at the fore-mid part
33
34 286 moved backward and the curvature of the vector at the rear part increased.
35
36 287 The velocities at the inlet and outlet of the raceway showed that most of the u+v
37
38
288 values were more than zero, indicating that under the influence of APFD, the water
39
40
289 was effectively pushed through the raceway, flowing into the purification zone, and
41
42
43
290 returning to the aquaculture unit for self-circulation.
44
45 291 3.2 Velocity patterns in cross-sections
46
47
48 292 The velocity distributions in the different cross-sections are shown in Fig. 8. The
49
50 293 color showed the velocity value of v+w, the blue vector arrows indicated the direction
51
52 294 of v+w. The gray dotted lines were boundaries between the plug-flow and the reflux
53
54 295 which were consistent with the horizontal velocity patterns above. In reference to Fig.
55
56 296 7(ii), the plug-flow and the reflux zone were distinguished and separated on two sides
57
58 297 of the dotted line.

3
4 298 At the inlet and the rear part, i.e., the C-(40) and the C-140~185, the flow was
5
6 299 mostly pushed and the velocities were uniform. At the fore-mid part (C-5~120), there
7
8 300 were a plug-flow zone and a reflux zone. Velocities varied greatly with the
9
10 301 cross-sections and were mostly larger at the plug-flow side. In the two cross-sections
11
12 302 immediately downstream of the APFD, i.e., C-5&20, there were high velocity cores
13
14 303 that were primarily distributed at the plug-flow zone. The low velocity cores were
15
16 304 located in the reflux zone. The plug-flow area was smaller than the reflux area in
17
18 305 these two sections. At the following sections, i.e., the C-40~120, the plug-flow area
19
20 306 gradually expanded. There were low velocity cores distributed in the reflux zone and
21
22 307 the velocities of the entire section tended to be uniform.
23
24 308 The vectors showed that there were secondary flows at the center and the flow
25
26 309 near side walls of the raceway moved from the bottom to the surface (i.e., the large
27
28 310 blue arrows in Fig. 8). The secondary flow at the center rotated counterclockwise and
29
30 311 its cell approximately coincided with the low velocity core in the reflux zone (as
31
32 312 shown by the yellow circle in Fig. 8).

49 323 3.3 Turbulent characteristics
50
51
324 In the self-aeration models with high water heads and flow rates, air bubbles play
52
53
54
325 an important role in drag reduction and accelerate the dissipation rate of turbulent
55
56
326 kinetic energy [26]. This is also the mechanism of erosion reduction and energy
57
58 327 dissipation in some hydraulic structures. In this study, the movements of air bubbles

23 341 Fig. 9. Turbulence characteristics in the horizontal sections.
24
25 342 Color represents the horizontal patterns of the turbulent kinetic energy. Lines indicate the
26
27 343 Reynolds shear force in the three directions.
28
29 344 At each depth, the turbulence characteristics were not evident at the inlet (x=-40)
30
31 345 and the rear part (x=140-185), while appeared intensively at the fore-mid part
32
33 346 (x=0-120) of the raceway. Combined with Fig. 7(ii), it shows that both the Reynolds
34
35 347 shear stress (t) and the turbulent kinetic energy (k) in the plug-flow zone were higher
36
37 348 than in the reflux zone. The values of these turbulence characteristics gradually
38
39 349 increased closer to the water surface.
40
41 350 The patterns of the Reynolds shear stress (t) in the three directions were similar.
42
43 351 Besides the maximum value in the plug-flow zone, there was a smaller peak in the
44
45 352 reflux zone. The Reynolds shear stress in each section were compared to show that
46
47 353 the value of |<U+0001D462>'<U+0001D464>'| was larger than that in the other two directions, while the values
48
49 354 of |<U+0001D462>'<U+0001D463>'| and |<U+0001D463>'<U+0001D464>'| varied little, indicating that the turbulence in the longitudinal
50
51 355 and vertical directions was relatively large and the strength did not differ much.
52
53 356 The turbulent kinetic energy (k) showed a single trend with water depth. There
54
55
357 was only one core of high value that was located in the plug-flow zone. Its value
56
57
358 decreased outward. Close to the free surface, the maximum of k increased and the
58
59
60
359 core tended to move to the APFD. This movement trend was the same as the

3
4 360 movement of the high velocity core of plug-flow with water depth (shown in Fig. 7),
5
6 361 showing that the velocity at the fore-mid part had a good correlation with the
7
8 362 turbulence.
9
10 363 The experimental fluid was a type of bubble-induced multiphase flow in the
11
12 364 circulating system. The movements of the bubbles induced the flow turbulence, and
13
14 365 the centripetal force was generated at the turn of the circulation system. There were
15
16 366 evident secondary flows in the different sections. According to the mechanism, the
17
18 367 secondary flows were divided into two categories by Prandtl [27]. The secondary flow
19
20 368 caused by the centripetal force was termed the first kind which is common in river
21
22 369 bends. However secondary flows can be observed in some straight channels because
23
24 370 of the turbulence anisotropy. This kind of secondary flow was termed the second kind
25
26 371 [28]. Its mechanism was first deduced by Einstein and Li [29] on the basis of RANS
27
28 372 equations and many current numerical simulations tried to reproduce this kind of
29
30 373 secondary [28,30]. Fig. 9 and Fig. 7 show that the flow turbulence was more intense
31
32 374 at the fore-mid part and the secondary flow of the Prandtl’s second kind was obvious.
33
34 375 The turbulence at the rear part greatly weakened and the centripetal force had a
35
36 376 greater contribution to the water flow, primarily generating the secondary flow of
37
38
377 Prandtl’s first kind.
39
40
378 The patterns in depths of z=5 and z=10 were worthy of attention. The depth of
41
42
43
379 z=5 was located below the installation height of the APFD and the z=10 depth was the
44
45
380 APFD installation height where the air bubbles generated and floated here, thus these
46
47 381 two depths were little affected by bubbles. Yet the patterns similar to the upper depths
48
49 382 were observed in these two depths. This was because that there were secondary flows
50
51 383 in cross-sections (Fig. 8) so the turbulence was transmitted in the vertical direction
52
53 384 and obvious turbulence remained even in the wall region (in reference to the division
54
55 385 of Table 1).

386 3.4 Plug-flow characteristics
4
5
6 387 Fig. 8 shows that the velocities at the last three cross-sections (x=160~185) were
7
8 388 mostly positive and there was little reflux. To measure its cycle efficiency, the
9
10 389 average flow rate of the three sections was used to represent the overall flow rate of
11
12 390 the raceway. The effects of the lateral and vertical velocities were ignored (v and w),
13
14 391 so the plug-flow rate was calculated using the streamwise velocity (u) according to
15
16
392 Eq. (6).
17
18 393 (6)
<U+0001D444>160 = <U+222C><U+0001D462>(160,<U+0001D466>,<U+0001D467>)<U+0001D451><U+0001D466><U+0001D451><U+0001D467>
19
20
394 Where <U+0001D444>160 is the flow rate at cross-section x=160, <U+0001D462>(160,<U+0001D466>,<U+0001D467>) is the
21
22
23
395 streamwise velocity at each point of measurement point at x=160. The flow rates at
24
25
396 cross-sections x=175 and x=185, i.e., <U+0001D444>175 and <U+0001D444>185, were calculated the same way.
26
27 397 The plug-flow rates of the last three sections are seen in Fig. 10. The computing
28
29 398 results of the flow rate at each cross-section are shown in Table 3. The calculated
30
31 399 average value was 994cm3/s and the average streamwise velocity was <U+0001D448>
32
33 400 = 0.97cm/s.
34
35 401 The specific flow pattern in the raceway was neglected, so the cycle efficiency
36
37 402 was represented by the average flow rate. The water retention time was calculated by
38
39 403 Eq. (7),
40
41 404 <U+0001D461> = <U+0001D449>/<U+0001D444> (7)
42
43 405 where V indicates the volume of water in raceway. The water retention time was
44
45 406 calculated, <U+0001D461> ˜ 226s ˜ 3.8min. There was reflux in the raceway, so the retention
46
47 407 time was longer, and the calculated value was underestimated. This also meant that
48
49 408 oxygen remained in the raceway for a long time, rather than being simply transferred
50
51 409 downstream by the flow, which increased the efficiency of aeration.

38 413 The IPRS is applied to commercial scales in the United Stated and China. The
39
40 414 general engineering size in China is 20~25m length, 4~5m wide and 1.5~2m water
41
42 415 depth. The longitudinal and lateral linear scales between the prototype and the model
43
44 416 were <U+0001D706><U+0001D43F> = 5/0.3 = 16.7, and the vertical linear scale was <U+0001D706><U+0001D449> = 2/0.34 = 5.88. To
45
46 417 extend the experimental results into the field, the scale of the average flow rate was
47
48 418 <U+0001D706><U+0001D444> = <U+0001D706><U+0001D43F><U+0001D706><U+0001D449>1.5 = 238, and the scale of the average velocity was <U+0001D706><U+0001D463> = <U+0001D706><U+0001D449>0.5 = 2.4. The
49
50 419 average flow rate in the prototype reached <U+0001D444><U+0001D443> = 0.237m3/s = 853m3/h and the
51
52 420 average velocity was about <U+0001D448><U+0001D443> = 0.024m/s. The length of each raceway primarily
53
54
421 influenced the breeding capacity and density of the system, which had less influence
55
56
422 on the flow rate and the exchange time, so it was rarely considered in the design. The
57
58
59
423 longitudinal scale was ignored and we tried to convert the experimental model into

4 424 the commercial application of Brown et al. [12]. Each raceway size in Brown’s
5
6 425 experiment was 7.71m×4.88m×1.22m (length × width × depth). The lateral linear
7
8 426 scale between the two models was <U+0001D706><U+0001D43F> = 4.88/0.3 = 16.3, and the vertical linear scale
9
10 427 was <U+0001D706><U+0001D449> = 1.22/0.34 = 3.6. The scale of flow rate was <U+0001D706><U+0001D444> = <U+0001D706><U+0001D43F><U+0001D706><U+0001D449>1.5 = 111. The
11
12 428 conversion flow rate was 0.11m3/s, which was close to Brown’s experimental result
13
14 429 of 0.15m3/s. It shows that the APFD in the present experiment can effectively
15
16 430 promot the water flow in a commercial scale.
17
18 431 The hydrodynamic characteristics in an IPRS with APFD are clearly understood,
19
20 432 however, although there were some deficiencies in this study.
21
22 433 The experiment was performed without fish, although fish exist in nature and
23
24 434 will affect the hydrodynamic and the water quality in the raceway. These conditions
25
26 435 will also affect the physiological function and behavior of the fish. The movement of
27
28 436 the fish increases the turbulence, which affects the hydrodynamic conditions, such as
29
30 437 the drag coefficient, the average velocity distribution, the turbulence characteristics,
31
32 438 and the mixing time of the water body [31,32]. The residual baits and metabolic
33
34 439 wastes produced by fish farming could affect the water quality. As the culture density
35
36 440 increases, the mean velocity decreases, and the turbulence characteristics are higher.
37
38
441 The resuspension of the materials means that the self-purification ability is higher at
39
40
442 high stocking densities [33,34]. It is necessary to conduct experiments that include
41
42
43
443 fish breeding conditions to explore the effect that fish have on the system.
44
45
444 This experiment was performed under the conditions of aeration rate at 30L/min
46
47 445 and the installation height at 10cm from the bottom. Different test configurations
48
49 446 would result in different hydrodynamic responses. Oca et al. [35-37] have explored
50
51 447 the effect that baffle, inlet characteristics, water depth, flow rate, and other factors
52
53 448 have on the distribution of flow in different tank geometries. It is necessary to conduct
54
55 449 comparative tests on various design parameters of the system to determine the
56
57 450 optimum design and configurations to meet the economic requirement for
58
59 451 aquaculture.

4 452 The IPRS is an abnormal model in laboratory. The aeration scale remains
5
6 453 unclear, making it necessary to conduct field measurements or to use a numerical

11 455 4 Conclusion
12
13
456 In our IPRS, the APFD was the only source of power. This differs from the
14
15
457 previous system using the specific flow pumping device. The APFD simultaneously
16
17
18
458 increased the DO and promoted the circulation of the IPRS. The IPRS is commonly
19
20
459 used and the flow conditions are important to operate and optimize the system. The
21
22 460 flow field of the aquaculture raceway with APFD was described in detail in this study.
23
24 461 The main conclusions are as follows:
25
26 462 (1) At the fore-mid part of the raceway there were the plug-flow and the reflux.
27
28 463 The flow was affected by the turbulence. Both the flow velocities and the turbulent
29
30 464 characteristics were higher than the rear part and the values increased with depth. At
31
32 465 the rear part, the flow was uniform and changed little in all directions.
33
34 466 (2) The fluid had obvious secondary flow in both the horizontal and cross
35
36 467 sections. The secondary flow in horizontal sections was divided into two parts. The
37
38 468 secondary flow at the fore-mid part was mainly induced by the turbulence and the rear
39
40 469 part was caused by the centripetal force.
41
42 470 (3) The velocities at the inlet and the outlet of the raceway maintained a positive
43
44 471 velocity value, indicating that the system could effectively self-circulate. The
45
46 472 plug-flow capacity of the APFD was described. The reflux range reached at about
47
48 473 x=100 and the ratio between the area of plug-flow and the reflux was about 6:4 at
49
50 474 each depth. The average plug-flow rate in the raceway was 994cm3/s and the water
51
52 475 retention time was about 3.8min in our experimental model.
53
54 476 Although there were some shortcomings, this study aided in understanding the
55
56 477 hydrodynamic characteristics induced by APFD in IPRS, as well as providing
57
58 478 calibration and comparative data for future numerical simulation. This could optimize
59
60 479 the design of IPRS and improve the new mode of the intense aquaculture system.

Response to reviewers’ comments
We thank the reviewers for their constructive comments on our manuscript.
Answers to Reviewer #1
1) As the depth described in the paper is a bit confusing, we change the description and use
height instead.
2) We add a legend to each figure/plot under considering your suggestions.
3) We sincerely thanks for your careful review. We have modified the language and usage in
the paper according to the pdf file you attached.
Answers to Reviewer #2
1) The main difference between the design in this manuscript and the other general IPRS is
that the APFD pushes the water and provides DO. And similar designs have been widely
used in China. However, in practice, as lacking of the understanding of the hydraulic
response, the DO and water flow conditions in the water body cannot be properly adjusted.
Because field trials are costly and difficult to find the impact of APFD on water flow, we
referred to existing designs for indoor model testing to measure detailed and sufficient
hydrodynamic data. Rectangular raceway saves 20% space than circular tank [1][2] and is
easy to construct and reform, making it the most popular type in China. The experimental
results can be converted to the commercial scale according to the similarity principle, and
will provide test data for further numerical simulation. Corresponding description can be
found in Introduce section (Line 87-92, 72-74, 101-103)

2) The secondary flow influences the suspended sediment concentration [3], affects the near
bed pattern to some extent [4], and promotes the transport processes [5]. On the one hand,
the secondary flow in cross-sections as well as the turbulence we observed in our
experiments can prevent residual bait and feces from being deposited in the raceway. On
the other hand, the secondary flow promotes the mixing of materials and energy. The use
of secondary flow in optimizing design can make the materials diffuse and mix more fully,
being utilized by fish. We added corresponding description at Page 21, Line 373-377 in
Results and discussion section.

3) The ADV we used in the experiment is Nortex Vectrino. It uses the Doppler effect to
measure current velocity. Sound does not reflect from water, but from particles suspended
in the water. As shown in Fig. 1, the Vectrino acoustic sensor consists of a center transducer
and four receivers. The Vectrino transmits short pairs of sound pulses from the center
transducer, listens to their echoes, and, ultimately, measures the change in pitch or
frequency of the returned sound [6]. Fig. 2 shows the beam crossing at approximately
50mm from the transducer, so the sampling point is far away from the sensor, thus avoiding
the instrument’s own interference with the water flow.

5) The surface of the aeration tube has a number of tiny holes, with a density of 700 to 1200
holes per meter length. The average diameter of these holes is 50 µm. We appreciate your
comments and added the information to the article. (Page 6, Line 126 in Experimental
setup and methods section.)
6) We refer to the Van's definition [7]. In a rectangular aquaculture raceway, the water flows
from one end to the other end. This typical flow pattern is called “plug-flow”. Different
from the plug flow in multiphase flow, its main feature is that the water flow is pushed and
circulates under the pump or aerator. This definition is also cited in many publications on
recirculating aquaculture system, such as the publications [7]-[11] listed below.
Considering that the definition is a bit confusing, we added a description to this in the
article (Page 3, Line 71-72 in Introduce section).

7) The aeration tubes were made of a nano-polymer material with unique physical properties.
Once the air was pumped into the aeration tube, the internal pressure increased, generating
micro-bubbles. If not working, the aeration orifices can shut off automatically due to water
pressure, thereby preventing clogging of contaminants. Corresponding information can be
found at Page 6, Line 126-127 and Line 132-136 in Experimental setup and method section.

Response to reviewers’ comments
We thank the reviewers for their constructive comments on our manuscript. The comments are
valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our paper. We have studied comments
carefully and have made correction which we hope to meet with approval. The main corrections in
the paper and the response to comments are as follows:
Answers to Reviewer #1
1) Since the plug-flow is not a general meaning in this article, it should not appear in abstract
without any statement. We accepted your suggestion to avoid using the unexplained terms.
We also revise the content of abstract, please see the Lines 23-27.
2) In Line 62, the original words (reaction mechanism) are our mistakes in writing. Thanks
for your careful review. We have made amendments to this, please see the Line 65.
3) The flow patterns in the original aquaculture raceways are similar to the plug-flow in pipes,
with uniform velocity distribution in cross sections [1]. However, there is little mixing in
raceways, resulting in the water quality vary significantly from inlet to outlet. And despite
improvements in the flow characteristics to increase mixing, the term “plug-flow” is still
used to describe the flow of water being pumped downstream in aquaculture raceways. We
explained their differences in detail according to your comment (Line 74-78). We also
checked the references and ensured that this term is more widely in aquaculture, especially
recirculating aquaculture system, such as the publications [1]-[5] listed below.
