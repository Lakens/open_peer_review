The authors have conducted a relatively large study investigating the extent to which
reproductive hormones influence contrast sensitivity. They suggest that this is an important area
to test, as it may account for effects of reproductive hormones on high-level vision judgements
(i.e. facial attractiveness ratings).
The purpose of the paper is clear and well justified, and the methods are sound.
Minor points:
• Given the non-significant effect of group, it may be advantageous to include a power
calculation.
• Give SD on age of participants.
• Did the groups differ on age? Given the CSF varies by age, it would be useful to have this
information (although it’s not critical for interpretation of the results, as there are no group
differences).
• Page 5: first paragraph, “gradual improvement in contrast sensitivity *across* experimental
sessions”
• In the intro you justify why contrast sensitivity might be particularly important for judgements
of attractiveness. In the discussion, you equate the contrast sensitivity function with low-level
vision. Are there other ways in which low-level vision could account for the high-level effects? It
would be good if this was included in the discussion.

Review of Webb, Hibbard & O’Gorman, “Variation in female reproductive hormones does not
affect contrast sensitivity”, submitted to Royal Society Open Science.
Summary
This study asks whether contrast sensitivity fluctuates throughout the menstrual cycle, and finds
that it does not. Although this is a null result, the study was well designed and conducted, with
well-chosen control groups, and there are no obvious methodological flaws. I have some minor
suggestions below for changes that the authors might wish to consider. However this is an
interesting finding that makes a useful addition to the literature.
Specific points
1. I felt that the authors could go into more detail about possible mechanisms that would underlie
the effect they are looking for (though in reality fail to detect). In particular, changes in GABA
concentration across the menstrual cycle could in principle affect contrast sensitivity.
2. The standard deviation of the Gaussian stimulus envelope is described as being “200 times the
wavelength of the sinusoid”. Presumably this would result in enormous patches (with a width of
200 cycles), that should change in diameter with spatial frequency. However this is not what
Figure 1 shows, where all patches are the same size and have relatively few cycles.
3 Please include a definition of Michelson contrast somewhere. In the first paragraph of the
Results some contrast thresholds are given in Michelson contrast (i.e. scaled 0-1) but elsewhere
(Figures) they are given as percentages. I prefer percentages, but either way the authors should
standardise throughout.
4. I suppose to be really technically correct the data in Figs 2-5
should be plotted on a logarithmic y-axis (and the thresholds estimated in log units). However I
don’t think this will matter much for getting your main point across, so won’t insist on it.
5. Consider combining Figures 3-5 into a single multi-panel figure.

This is an interesting study, with a clear rationale. The paper is well written and easy to follow.
Comments are given below.
Title: I think this should be more specific, for example, it could make it clear that it is concerned
with normal cycling reproductive hormones
Last paragraph of introduction: Sentence beginning, ‘Of multiple candidate measures…’ until the
end of the paragraph – this is essentially a repetition of the previous paragraph and could be
deleted.
Some additional methodological information should be included for clarity – e.g. image size,
duration, how much did the patterns deviate from vertical orientation etc?
One concern is that of order effects (learning) because of the lack of counterbalancing between
which sessions. This is evident in the data, where CS improved across the 3 experimental
sessions. This is acknowledged by the authors and some of this concern allayed with separate
ANOVAS for each session comparing group performance.
Figures – Figure 2 is not necessary and should be removed. A sentence confirming that the values
are consistent with what would be expected is probably sufficient.
Results section – 1st paragraph –the mean contrast threshold values given should be converted
from a proportion to a percentage, to be consistent with how they are reported in the figures.
Page 5 last sentence of first paragraph – this is quite a difficult sentence to follow and is dealt
with by the stats that examined group differences at each SF so could reasonably be removed.
Page 5, beginning of 3rd paragraph – I think this paragraph could be removed because it is a
repetition of the results reported just before it. Also, the comment that the results demonstrate
internal reliability with reference to perceptual learning should be removed. That the sessions
were not counterbalanced is a weakness of the study and isn’t directly relevant to the question at
hand so overcomplicates the take home message.
Figure 3 – 5. The data would be better expressed in a single multi-panel figure (a) 1 cpd, (b) 4 cpd,
(c) 16 cpd. The different scales on the y-axes for each SF should be noted in the figure legends. On
the x-axes, session numbers would be better replaced by ‘ovulatory phase’, ‘luteal phase’ and
‘menstrual phase’. This would give a better, more meaningful, representation of the data.
It would be useful if effect sizes were given for the stats.

Appendix A
We would like to thank the reviewers for their positive comments on the study, their overall
acknowledgement of it’s relevance to the 2 research areas, and their suggestions for areas of the paper
that can be improved with clarification or additional analyses.
Changes have been made based on this advice, and justification is provided below for the very few
recommended changes that we have not made. Revisions were, for the most part, quite minor. This
included alternations that were recommended by more than 1 reviewer, including the conversion of
Michelson contrast values to percentage format, and the presentation of individual figures for each of the
test sessions into a multi-panel figure. Other minor changes include a slight modification of the title,
inclusion of SD values for participant ages, effect sizes for each effect, and the alteration of 2 typos.
More detailed recommendations included clarification in the introduction and the discussion, so as to
include a reference to the possible GABA mechanism for contrast sensitivity, and whether other areas of
low-level vision may drive shifts in higher-level female perception. A suggestion of particular importance
from one of the reviewers was to conduct a post-hoc power analysis, based on the non-significant effect
of participant group. Some discussion of the power of the study is now included in the reults.
Comments from Reviewer 1:
Response to Reviewer 1:
Thank you for your comments and recommended revisions to the paper.
1) Given the non-significant effect of group, it may be advantageous to include a power calculation.
Some discussion of the effect size that might have been detectable with 80% power has now been
included in the results.
2) Give SD on age of participants.
We have now included, under the methods/participants section, the standard deviation of participants’
age – thank you for highlighting this omission.
3) Did the groups differ on age? Given the CSF varies by age, it would be useful to have this information
(although it’s not critical for interpretation of the results, as there are no group differences).
In the first paragraph of the results section, we have also acknowledged that contrast sensitivity varies
according to age, but noted that we did not check for differences in age between groups because the
age range of participants falls outside of where this variation occurs. This is explained in the results
section. Given too, as you have already mentioned, that there was no group difference, it seemed
unnecessary to conduct statistical tests to assess whether groups differed on age.
4) Page 5: first paragraph, “gradual improvement in contrast sensitivity *across* experimental
sessions”
Thank you - this has been corrected.
5) In the intro you justify why contrast sensitivity might be particularly important for judgements of
attractiveness. In the discussion, you equate the contrast sensitivity function with low-level vision. Are
there other ways in which low-level vision could account for the high-level effects? It would be good if
this was included in the discussion.
The way that the discussion was written did link ‘low level processing’ solely with ‘contrast sensitivity’.
This has now been corrected, and the discussion expanded to clarify that other low-level facts (such as
symmetry sensitivity), as well as high-level factors, might also be relevant to shifts in preferences.
Comments from Reviewer 2:
Thank you for your comments and recommended revisions to the paper.
1) I felt that the authors could go into more detail about possible mechanisms that would underlie the
effect they are looking for (though in reality fail to detect). In particular, changes in GABA concentration
across the menstrual cycle could in principle affect contrast sensitivity.
The second from last paragraph of the introduction now includes a brief mention of the relationship
between GABA concentration and both contrast sensitivity and the menstrual cycle. Though we have not
expanded too much on this, we believe that it provides a more detailed explanation of how contrast
sensitivity may vary across the menstrual cycle
2) The standard deviation of the Gaussian stimulus envelope is described as being “200 times the
wavelength of the sinusoid”. Presumably this would result in enormous patches (with a width of 200
cycles), that should change in diameter with spatial frequency. However this is not what Figure 1 shows,
where all patches are the same size and have relatively few cycles.
In the methods/stimuli section, the correct value for the SD of the Gaussian stimulus should have been
reported as 4.8 times the wavelength of the sinusoid. Initially this was incorrectly reported in the wrong
units (200). We apologise for this error, and it has now been corrected to report the correct value of
4.8.
3) Please include a definition of Michelson contrast somewhere. In the first paragraph of the Results
some contrast thresholds are given in Michelson contrast (i.e. scaled 0-1) but elsewhere (Figures) they
are given as percentages. I prefer percentages, but either way the authors should standardise
throughout.
We now report all Michelson contrasts, including those plotted on the graphs, in percentages; the
definition of contrast is also now given as a percentage.
4) I suppose to be really technically correct the data in Figs 2-5 should be plotted on a logarithmic y-axis
(and the thresholds estimated in log units). However I don’t think this will matter much for getting your
main point across, so won’t insist on it.
The y-axes are now logarithmic.
5) 5. Consider combining Figures 3-5 into a single multi-panel figure.
These have now been combined into a single figure.
Comments from Reviewer 3:
Thank you for your comments and recommended revisions to the paper.
1) Title: I think this should be more specific, for example, it could make it clear that it is concerned with
normal cycling reproductive hormones
We agree that the original title may at first appear a little vague when it comes to the role of female
reproductive hormones. We have therefore changed this so that the paper is now titled “Natural
variation in female reproductive hormones does not affect contrast sensitivity”. We believe that from
this, it is now clearer that the paper is about contrast sensitivity in naturally cycling women, and that it
implies the use of a control group (i.e. contraceptive users) that subsequently do not also need to be
named in the title.
2) Last paragraph of introduction: Sentence beginning, ‘Of multiple candidate measures…’ until the end
of the paragraph – this is essentially a repetition of the previous paragraph and could be deleted.
For the final paragraph of the introduction, you have suggested that the sentence beginning “Of multiple
candidate measures..” to until the end of the paragraph is a repeat of the previous paragraph, and so
could be deleted. We did remove this, and re-read the introduction without this information, but felt as
though without this section, albeit a little repetitive, a summary of the rationale for the present
experiment was not clear. Bearing in mind that some readers may not always be familiar with the
psychophysical aspects of this area of research, and given that the introduction is fairly psychophysics-
heavy, we felt that a succinct and to the point summary of this would be useful to have at the end of the
introduction.
3) Some additional methodological information should be included for clarity – e.g. image size, duration,
how much did the patterns deviate from vertical orientation etc?
Details of the duration and orientation of the stimuli are included. The size of the stimuli scaled with the
spatial frequency, so this is given as the standard deviation of the Gaussian envelope, in multiples of the
wavelength of the sinusoidal modulation.
4) One concern is that of order effects (learning) because of the lack of counterbalancing between which
sessions. This is evident in the data, where CS improved across the 3 experimental sessions. This is
acknowledged by the authors and some of this concern allayed with separate ANOVAS for each session
comparing group performance.
We appreciate your acknowledgment of how our analyses dealt with the practice effects across test
sessions, by conducting separate ANOVAs for the data from each test session. Unfortunately, this was
one of the recognised risks of conducting a within-subjects experiment, but we felt that the importance
of measuring women across their individual cycles outweighed the possibility of measuring practice
effects.
5) Figures – Figure 2 is not necessary and should be removed. A sentence confirming that the values are
consistent with what would be expected is probably sufficient.
We have removed this figure.
6) Results section – 1st paragraph –the mean contrast threshold values given should be converted from
a proportion to a percentage, to be consistent with how they are reported in the figures.
We now report contrast consistently as a percentage
7) Page 5 last sentence of first paragraph – this is quite a difficult sentence to follow and is dealt with by
the stats that examined group differences at each SF so could reasonably be removed.
We agree and have removed this sentence
8) Page 5, beginning of 3rd paragraph – I think this paragraph could be removed because it is a
repetition of the results reported just before it. Also, the comment that the results demonstrate internal
reliability with reference to perceptual learning should be removed. That the sessions were not
counterbalanced is a weakness of the study and isn’t directly relevant to the question at hand so
overcomplicates the take home message.
We agree that the reference to perceptual learning may confuse the purpose and findings of the study,
and so have removed this. However, we have decided to keep the short summary of results on the basis
that we feel it is important to get across that the study accurately recorded the contrast sensitivity
function in observers, and to reiterate the effects we expected to find, but did not.
9) Figure 3 – 5. The data would be better expressed in a single multi-panel figure (a) 1 cpd, (b) 4 cpd,
(c) 16 cpd. The different scales on the y-axes for each SF should be noted in the figure legends. On the
x-axes, session numbers would be better replaced by ‘ovulatory phase’, ‘luteal phase’ and ‘menstrual
phase’. This would give a better, more meaningful, representation of the data.
We have combined these to a single figure and made these changes.
10) It would be useful if effect sizes were given for the stats.
Effect sizes (partial eta-squared) are now included.
