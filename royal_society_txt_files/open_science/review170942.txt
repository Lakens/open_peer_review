This paper presents an interesting preparation of TiO2 homogeneous hybrid structure and
applied to perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in air. perovskite solar cells based on the homogeneous
hybrid structure present an maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.39%, which is
higher than that of pure TiO2 nanosheets (TiO2NSs). The enhanced properties is attribute to the
better contact of TiO2 nanosheets/nanoparticles (TiO2NSs/NPs) with CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3)
and fewer pinholes in electron transport materials (ETM). This work is interesting and could be
accepted for publication.
1) Some details should be corrected, e.g. In the TEM and HRTEM section, the colour of “Fig. 3” is
different from others.
2) In page 6 line 17, it was mentioned that “Surprisingly, as the amount of TiO2NPs increased
upon the cycles to seven, the PSCs exhibited a best PCE of 5.39%, with Voc = 0.82 V, Jsc = 17.06
mA cm-2, and FF = 0.40.”. Please give more information on the test conditions.
3) Some important reviews on TiO2 should be updated:

Pengyu Su et al. reported the use of TiO2 homogeneous hybrid structure of nanosheets and
nanoparticles for perovskite solar cells and investigated the performance of the solar cells with
different cycle of NPs coating. It was found that the properties of solar cells with TiO2 NSs/NPs
structure were significantly enhanced compare with that of the solar cell has only NSs anode
structure. It is suggested that the performance improvement is attribute to a better contact
resulting from the NPs coating layer in between the NSs and MAPbI3 and fewer pinhole
exposure. I think this work is interesting to a broad research community. It is acceptable for
publication in Royal Society Open Science after several concerns are addressed as follows:
1) The efficiency of 5.39 % from the cell with TiO2 NSs/NPs is a much better one than that of
photoanode with only NSs structure. I am curious if the authors ever compare that with the cell
with only NPs.
2) The “entire procedure” in line 2 page 3 is confusing. There is no detailed description of what
procedure is an entire one. Please make it clear.
3) The solar cell performance is size-dependent. The authors mentioned a spin-coating size, 1.5
cm x 1.5 cm, which is much bigger than the normal lab investigation on PCE of solar cells. Is that
the active area for PCE measurement? If it is not, please add the information into experimental
section.
4) The “Fig. 3” in text is blue and there are also blue patterns in those figures. If they are
highlighted, please add some statements accordingly. If they are not, please correct the colors.
5) Please index all the peaks in Fig 4a, XRD spectra.
6) Please revise the format of line 50 on page 6.
7) Please polish the writing of the manuscript and correct some words such as “present an

Response: The English (Including Grammar) has been carefully revised in our
manuscript.
1. The statements of “Among diverse of TiO2 nanostructures morphologies, TiO2
nanosheets (TiO2NSs) have been widely applied in the field of photovoltaic
cells due to the sufficient surface area” were corrected as “Among diverse of
TiO2 nanostructures morphologies, TiO2 nanosheets (TiO2NSs) have been
widely applied in the field of photovoltaic cells due to its sufficient surface
area”. (Line 4 on page 2)
2. The statements of “The photovoltaic properties of PSCs based on
TiO2NSs/NPs homogeneous hybrid structure were superior to that based on
bared TiO2NSs due to the introducing of TiO2NPs” were corrected as “The
photovoltaic properties of PSCs based on TiO2NSs/NPs homogeneous hybrid
structure are superior to that based on bared TiO2NSs due to the introducing of
TiO2NPs”. (Line 41 on page 2)
3. The statements of “TiO2NSs films were fabricated by a hydrothermal method
at 170 <U+2103> for 3 h” were corrected as “TiO2NSs films were fabricated by a
hydrothermal method at 170 <U+2103> for 3 h and annealed at 550<U+2103> for 2 h in air”.
(Line 57 on page 2)
4. The statements of “Then, 50 µL PbI2 (462 mg/mL in dimethylformamide) was
spin-coated onto the substrates (1.5 cm*1.5 cm) with a low speed of 500 r.m.p.
for 5 s and at a high speed of 4000 r.m.p. for 30 s followed” were corrected as
“Then, 50 µL PbI2 (462 mg/mL in dimethylformamide) was spin-coated onto

followed with a high speed of 4000 r.m.p. for 30 s”. (Line 17 on page 3)
5. The statements of “Fig. 1 presented the top SEM images of the TiO2NSs array
films after combined with TiO2NPs for different cycles” were corrected as “In
Fig. 1 we presents the top SEM images of the TiO2NSs array films after
combined with TiO2NPs for different cycles”. (Line 7 on page 4)
6. The statements of “The inset of Fig. 1b represented an enlarged image of
TiO2NSs deposited with TiO2NPs of 1C” were corrected as “The inset of Fig.
1b represents an enlarged image of TiO2NSs deposited with TiO2NPs of 1C”.
(Line 15 on page 4)
7. The statements of “As portrayed in Fig. 2a, the aligned TiO2NSs films were
relatively smooth and vertically grew on the FTO/c-TiO2 substrates, providing
the transfer path for electrons. The thickness of the film was about 370 nm. Fig.
2b was the SEM image of TiO2NSs film after deposition 7C TiO2NPs, it is
obvious that the surface of the TiO2NSs became rougher, which benefits for
the combination of MAPbI3 [21]. The cross-sectional SEM images of PSCs
devices with and without TiO2NPs were presented in Fig. 2c and d,
respectively. MAPbI3 crystals were compactly arranged on the surface of TiO2
substrates. When the ETM films was without TiO2NPs, some pinholes existed
visibly as shown in Fig. 2c. As comparison, MAPbI3 combined closer with the
TiO2NSs/NPs homogenous hybrid films without any pinholes, which lead to
higher PCE” were corrected as “As portrayed in Fig. 2a, the aligned TiO2NSs
films are relatively smooth and vertically grew on the FTO/c-TiO2 substrates,
providing the transfer path for electrons. The thickness of the film is about 370

When the ETM films are not coated with TiO2NPs, some pinholes exist visibly
as shown in Fig. 2c. As comparison, MAPbI3 combined closer with the
TiO2NSs/NPs homogenous hybrid films without any pinholes, leading to
higher PCE”. (Line 25-47 on page 4)
8. The statements of “Besides the diffraction peaks of FTO, TiO2 and a weak
peak at 12.7°of PbI2, other diffraction peaks all correspond to MAPbI3” were
corrected as “Except the diffraction peaks of FTO, TiO2 and a weak peak at
12.7°of PbI2, other diffraction peaks all correspond to MAPbI3”. (Line 41 on
page 5)
9. The statements of “This result indicates that the MAPbI3 films combined with
TiO2NSs/NPs films better compared with TiO2NSs films” were corrected as
“This result indicates that the MAPbI3 films combine with TiO2NSs/NPs films
better compared with TiO2NSs films”. (Line 17 on page 6)
10. The statements of “This inevitably will increase the J-V characteristics of
PSCs” were corrected as “This inevitably will decrease the J-V characteristics
of PSCs”. (Line 15 on page 7)
11. The statements of “One can found that holes were transported to the counter
electrode by the HTM in scheme. 1 (the short black arrows). Electrons were
transported to FTO by TiO2NPs (the long blue arrows) and TiO2NSs/NPs (the
long brown arrows). Compared with the pure TiO2NSs films, fewer pinholes
existed in the TiO2NSs/NPs homogenous hybrid films, and this hybrid films
own higher specific surface area. Therefore, photovoltaic performance of PSCs
based on TiO2NPs/NSs homogenous hybrid structure was significantly
enhanced” were corrected as “One can found that holes are transported to the

Reviewer: 2
1. Response to comment: The efficiency of 5.39% from the cell with TiO2 NSs/NPs
is a much better one than that of photoanode with only NSs structure. I am curious if
the authors ever compare that with the cell with only NPs.
Response: Thank you for the comments on the paper. The corresponding details of
cell with only NPs was described in Supplementary Material. As comparison, we
fabricated PSCs based on 7C TiO2NPs. Under one sun AM 1.5G irradiance, PSCs
based on FTO/c-TiO2/7C TiO2NPs exhibited a best PCE of 4.32%, with Voc = 0.79 V,
Jsc = 14.7 mA cm-2, and FF = 0.37. PSCs based on FTO/c-TiO2/3h NSs/7C TiO2NPs
show surperior photovoltaic characterization, which exhibited a best PCE of 5.39%,
with Voc = 0.82 V, Jsc = 17.06 mA cm-2, and FF = 0.40.
2. Response to comment: The “entire procedure” in line 2 page 3 is confusing. There
is no detailed description of what procedure is an entire one. Please make it clear.
Response: Thank you for reminding us the confused description on the study and we
are very sorry for our negligence. We have the confused parts revised accordingly and
hope that this new manuscript will be clear. The statements of “The entire procedure
was termed as one cycle (C).” was revised into “The entire procedure of fabricating
TiO2NPs films was termed as one cycle (C).” (Line 7 on page 3)
3. Response to comment: The solar cell performance is size-dependent. The authors
mentioned a spin-coating size, 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm, which is much bigger than the normal
lab investigation on PCE of solar cells. Is that the active area for PCE measurement?
If it is not, please add the information into experimental section.
Response: We greatly appreciate the professional reviews and guidance of the referee
and we revised the manuscript accordingly. The statements of “The current-voltage
curves of PSCs were recorded in the air, the bias scan rate is 100 mV/s” were
corrected as “The working area of devices was 0.15 mm2. All current voltage curves
were recorded in air and drived from reverse scan (the bias scan rate was 100mV/s)”.
(Line 31 on page 6)
