Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
I have reviewed the manuscript “Proactive avoidance behaviour and pace of life syndrome in
Atlantic salmon”. The goal of this study was to investigate whether there is a relationship
between growth and development rate and boldness in behaviour (as assessed by hypoxia
avoidance and plasma cortisol levels) in hatchery bred Atlantic salmon.
I think the results of the study do address the hypothesis at hand, although it seems to be spread
across several figures. Thus, I have comments/suggestions regarding data presentation and
several major questions regarding the experiments. I also have more minor editorial comments
for the authors.
Major questions and comments:
- Seeing that the goal was to investigate a possible relationship between growth and boldness in
behaviour, and also that for both are continuous measurements, it should be possible to relate
fish weight to frequency of Stayers and Leavers (Fig.4A measurement) and/or to plasma cortisol
concentration (Fig.4B measurement) and to look at the correlation between the two variables?
This way of data presentation would presumably directly address the hypothesis instead of
having weight distribution in one set of figures (Fig.2) and the response variable in 2-3 other
figures (Fig.3-4).
- Figure 3C: It’s not clear which of data points in here are from fish that were from UM and LM
groups. Was there a difference in swimming depth between the two groups? Could the fish
classified in the two different groups (if there was a spread) be indicated in different colors to
indicate whether there was a difference in swimming depth?
- Figure 4: Due to the distribution of fish weights, is there a size-dependency of plasma cortisol
concentration at all?
- Figure 4: Can the authors discuss whether because the frequency of LM fish was lower (Fig.2B)
whether that created a bias in selecting fish with certain personalities for the hypoxia avoidance
experiment?
- The tentative hypothesis that the authors propose twice in the manuscript that “the occurrence
of such contrasts in domesticated lines suggest the tentative hypothesis that successful expression
of fast-proactive phenotypes depend on the presence of at least a small fraction of passive copers
in the population.” This does not seem to be a testable hypothesis. You’re always going to have a
normal distribution of fish weights and a range of behaviours. Can the authors
comment/elaborate on this?
- With the LM being not smoltified and the UM being smoltified, that would indicate large
differences in gill morphology that may influence their hypoxia tolerance. Can the authors
address whether how that would impact the interpretation of these results?
Minor comments (* indicate my edits):
- Add x-axis labelling into Fig.3A
- Genus and species need to be italicized throughout the manuscript
- “N2” and “O2”, 2 needs to be in subscript throughout the manuscript
- Figure captions: include sample sizes
- Figure 2A: since the x-axis is not continuous, these points shouldn’t be connected with lines
- Figure 4B: Perhaps different color schemes could be used here to match what is used for LM and
UM in Fig.4A, since these are all UM fish and no LM fish are present for this dataset
- Page 1, line 35: “This raises the question *of whether* such traits cluster… “
- Page 1, line 45: “There was a higher frequency of …. In this fast-developing fraction of fish“,

- Page 1, line 56: “… showing consistency between context and over time”, is this indicating that
behavioural traits displayed by organisms are consistent in different context and over the course
of an organisms life-time? Phrasing for POLS unclear.

- Page 5, line 22: “There *was* a higher proportion…”
- Page 5, line 28: Any citation for this previous observation that Stayers would rather die of low
O2 than escape?

- Page 5, line 37: not sure what you mean here by ‘exposed to’ higher mortality, “… predicting
that proactive/bold personality types *show* higher mortality…”?
- Page 5, line 49: “… aquaculture selects for selecting..”, awkward phrasing

Overall I found this paper interesting and easily readable. I thought that the authors outlined the
need for further investigation rather well, but it could benefit from a more explicit hypothesis
statement in the introduction.
There were a few typos throughout, and I would recommend reading through and fixing as they
occur.
I would recommend a justification for using 35g as the split between the LM and UM groups.
You noted in the study that there were a limited number of LM individuals in the control
treatment that impaired your ability to conduct all statistical tests. Is there a biological or
observational reason for this cutoff, or simply numeric?

Feedback to the reviews of ID RSOS-181859, 14 Dec. 2018
Reviewer 1
1. I have reviewed the manuscript “Proactive avoidance behaviour and pace of life
syndrome in Atlantic salmon”. The goal of this study was to investigate whether
there is a relationship between growth and development rate and boldness in
behaviour (as assessed by hypoxia avoidance and plasma cortisol levels) in
hatchery bred Atlantic salmon.
I think the results of the study do address the hypothesis at hand, although it
seems to be spread across several figures. Thus, I have comments/suggestions
regarding data presentation and several major questions regarding the
experiments. I also have more minor editorial comments for the authors.
Our response: We have looked into the suggestions made by the reviewer.
Major questions and comments:
2. Seeing that the goal was to investigate a possible relationship between growth
and boldness in behaviour, and also that for both are continuous measurements,
it should be possible to relate fish weight to frequency of Stayers and Leavers
(Fig.4A measurement) and/or to plasma cortisol concentration (Fig.4B
measurement) and to look at the correlation between the two variables? This
way of data presentation would presumably directly address the hypothesis
instead of having weight distribution in one set of figures (Fig.2) and the
response variable in 2-3 other figures (Fig.3-4).
Our response: The issue raised by the reviewer is interesting, but it is not a
question of continuous measurements and thus not an expected correlation
between size and any variable. Any behavioural differences that can be
explained in terms of unimodal size differences may simply be part of a
proximate physiological explanations, rather than POLS. In anadromous
salmonid fishes the life history choice of sea migration related to the
development the year before smoltification. In line with this, the seawater
challenge revealed the fast-growing upper mode fish smoltified, while the lower
mode group did not. It is well known that growth thus is a consequence of the
life history decision to become a smolt, and smoltification per se is not a
consequence of size. Accordingly, we treated UM and LM as grouping variables.
Like vice, the hypoxia test revealed two contrasting behavioural responses to
this challenge; leavers and stayers. A confinement stress test confirmed that
these two contrasting behavioural reactions to hypoxia corresponded to the
proactive and reactive stress coping styles respectively. Thus, the bimodality of
growth/developmental trajectories and the contrasting stress coping styles
suggests that that the data should be treated as categorical rather that
continuous.
We do however see from the reviewers’ concerns that the aim of the study
needs to be clarified. To further clarify this, we have changed the last paragraph
in the introduction to clarify that it is a question of bimodality due to the growth
pattern based on the life history decision to reach smoltification.
3. Figure 3C: It’s not clear which of data points in here are from fish that were from
UM and LM groups. Was there a difference in swimming depth between the two
groups? Could the fish classified in the two different groups (if there was a
spread) be indicated in different colors to indicate whether there was a
difference in swimming depth?
Our response: We see the challenge here to understand the complexity in
hypoxia responses, and have improved both the Materials and Methods (2.2),
Results (3.2) and Figure legends to clarify this. Our study provides a very detailed
and consistent way of measuring the responses to a decline in oxygen, and we
felt it was necessary to show the changes in oxygen (Fig. 3 a) and swimming
depth (Fig. 3 b) from 80 minutes before to 80 minutes after the onset of hypoxia.
These two figures do however not show the relationship between the saturation
and the swimming depth, and the data point were thus presented in Fig. 3 C,
because it is not the time per se in the system that trigger the behavioural
changes, but a threshold oxygen saturation. The data points in Fig. 3 C are not
fish individuals, but measurements of swimming depths (based on triggering of
infrared sensors), and it is thus not possible to separate between the two
groups. It is however a very good idea to develop such method in the future. The
identification of the individual fish could first be done when they left hypoxia
and the tag number could be recorded by the PitTag antenna.
4. Figure 4: Due to the distribution of fish weights, is there a size-dependency of
plasma cortisol concentration at all?
Our response: The main difference in the plasma cortisol was between the two
groups of UM and LM, and there was only a weak (R-square=0.03) relationship in
the model. It is thus not a size-dependency in our data, but a group dependency.
5. Figure 4: Can the authors discuss whether because the frequency of LM fish was
lower (Fig.2B) whether that created a bias in selecting fish with certain
personalities for the hypoxia avoidance experiment?
Our response: All fish that were used in all tests were un-selected and due to
this and a very low mortality since hatching we might expect the fish to
represent a whole un-biased population. The hypoxia tests were done a time
period before the stress tests in order to avoid effects of the tests, and the stress
tests was done in un-selected groups independent of the result in the hypoxia
test. This protocol was used to avoid biased results, but the downside of that is
of course that the numbers of individual in the end result will differ. The chi-
square test does not require equal group sizes, so a lower number of individuals
in the LM group are not expected to induce a type I error.
6. The tentative hypothesis that the authors propose twice in the manuscript that
“the occurrence of such contrasts in domesticated lines suggest the tentative
hypothesis that successful expression of fast-proactive phenotypes depend on the
presence of at least a small fraction of passive copers in the population.” This
does not seem to be a testable hypothesis. You’re always going to have a normal
distribution of fish weights and a range of behaviours. Can the authors
comment/elaborate on this?
Our response: We understand the concern of the reviewer, and this statement
was not meant as conclusions from our study, but rather as a hypothesis that
might be tested in future studies. Our study demonstrates the occurrence of
behavioural traits linked to distinct developmental/growth trajectories, but it is
still an open question why such differences exist, and how domestication in
aquaculture should take that into account. We have omitted the statement from
the Conclusion and changed it in the Discussion to avoid misunderstandings.
7. With the LM being not smoltified and the UM being smoltified, that would
indicate large differences in gill morphology that may influence their hypoxia
tolerance. Can the authors address whether how that would impact the
interpretation of these results?
Our response: That is a good question that unfortunately cannot be tested in
our setup, but needs a completely different physiological approach. However,
size differences could not explain the hypoxia response, but there might of
course be other, not size dependent, physiological mechanisms explaining why
the UM group have a lower threshold for hypoxia. In the gills, the smoltification
process mostly affects the development of the chloride cells, and not the gill
morphology. A study of Jenjan et al. 2013 (Respiratory function in common
carp…, Animal Behaviour 85, 1245-1249) demonstrated a larger gill surface in
proactive fish. Since the proactive fish were the first to leave the hypoxia, a
different oxygen threshold cannot be explained as a larger gill surface. Such
mechanisms have not been studied in salmon smolts, and we cannot speculate
based upon our study.
Minor comments (* indicate my edits):
8. Add x-axis labelling into Fig.3A
Our response: The x-axis in Fig. 3 a was omitted because it is the same as in 3 b,
and it is stated in the legend that it is the same. Based on the comments we have
included it again.
9. Genus and species need to be italicized throughout the manuscript
10. “N2” and “O2”, 2 needs to be in subscript throughout the manuscript
Our response: Both point 9 and 10 seems to be happen when the document is
uploaded to RSOS, including some letters in the title. We will correct it again,
and hopefully it will be correct in the next upload.
11. Figure captions: include sample sizes
Our response: We have included sample size in the text, e.g. in connection with
comparisons and statistical tests, and generally think that a full list of sample
sizes in the figure captions are making the legends less readable. To meet the
reviewer’s comment, we have however included the sample sizes when possible
in the figure captions.
12. Figure 2A: since the x-axis is not continuous, these points shouldn’t be
connected with lines
Our response: We do not disagree with the reviewer, and included the lines in
order to make the figure easier to understand. We have omitted the lines and
changed to a bar figure.
13. Figure 4B: Perhaps different color schemes could be used here to match what is
used for LM and UM in Fig.4A, since these are all UM fish and no LM fish are
present for this dataset
Our response: It is right that Fig. 4 b is only UM fish (as stated in the figure
legend), but the use of black and grey is consistent in both figures, and we have
used black/white figures throughout the whole manuscript.
14. Page 1, line 35: “This raises the question *of whether* such traits cluster… “
Our response: Corrected.
15. Page 1, line 45: “There was a higher frequency of …. In this fast-developing
fraction of fish“, higher compared to?
Our response: Corrected.
16. Page 1, line 56: “… showing consistency between context and over time”, is this
indicating that behavioural traits displayed by organisms are consistent in
different context and over the course of an organisms life-time?
Our response: The question raised by the reviewer is interesting and relevant,
but beyond the scope of this study, and in this part of the text we are using the
normal definitions of this traits. However, the majority of studies regarding
animal personality have been performed in adult animals, and recently questions
have been raised regarding the existence of such trait correlations early in
development and the relation to personality traits expressed later in life (For
references, see Groothuis & Trillmich 2011. Unfolding personalities: The
importance of studying ontogeny. Dev Psychobiol 53(6): 641–655). We used the
common definition stated in Reale et al. 2010. Personality and the emergence of
the pace-of-life syndrome concept at the population level. Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. 365: 4051–4063. They
do not specify if they consider the constancy over time should be life long, but
discuss the genetic contribution to the behavioural profile of an individual, which
can imply that individual variation in behaviour should show constancy over a
life time. To what extent a behavioural trait is life-long will be a bit out of scope
of this paper.
17. Phrasing for POLS unclear.
Our response: We are not quite sure what the reviewer means, but we have
included an explanation of the term in the introduction
18. Page 1, line 59: “behavioural trait correlation”, correlation singular to agree with
“is” following.
Our response: Corrected.

further strengthen *by* a study”
Our response: Corrected.

25. Page 5, line 15: “This smoltification process includes a *suite*… “
Our response: Corrected.
26. Page 5, line 22: “There *was* a higher proportion…”
Our response: Corrected.
27. Page 5, line 28: Any citation for this previous observation that Stayers would
rather die of low O2 than escape?
Our response: We have not been able to find any publish data on this, but it is
our experience that hypoxia tests should not go below 25% in salmonids, as this
may be harmful for the fish, and will not change the result as the passive fish
rather wait and thus run a risk of dying of low oxygen. We have clarified this in
the manuscript.
28. Page 5, line 29: “… the individuals have the option of *moving* to other
habitats…”
Our response: Corrected.
29. Page 5, line 37: not sure what you mean here by ‘exposed to’ higher mortality,
“… predicting that proactive/bold personality types *show* higher mortality…”?
Our response: Corrected.
30. Page 5, line 49: “… aquaculture selects for selecting..”, awkward phrasing
Our response: Corrected.
31. Page 5, lines 51-53: This hypothesis would not be testable and also seems to be a
truism. You’re always going to have a normal distribution of fish weights and a
range of behaviours. Can the authors comment on this?
Our response: The problem is changed according to point 6.
32. Page 5, line 59 to end of page: This sentence is awkwardly long and requires
editing: “In line with this,….a sit and wait coping strategy”.
Our response: A full stop was missing, and has been corrected.

behavioural profile… characterized by a high level of active avoidance together

associated…”
Our response: Corrected.

“between”
Our response: Corrected.
36. Page 6, line 22: “… sorting fish *with* respect to hypoxia avoidance”
Our response: Corrected.
Reviewer 2
37. Overall I found this paper interesting and easily readable. I thought that the
authors outlined the need for further investigation rather well, but it could
benefit from a more explicit hypothesis statement in the introduction.
Our response: We have changed the last part of the introduction so the
hypotheses are clarified.
38. There were a few typos throughout, and I would recommend reading through
and fixing as they occur.
Our response: We have looked carefully at the manuscript in order to take out
typos, and some of them have been kindly identified by reviewer 1.
39. I would recommend a justification for using 35g as the split between the LM and
UM groups. You noted in the study that there were a limited number of LM
individuals in the control treatment that impaired your ability to conduct all
statistical tests. Is there a biological or observational reason for this cutoff, or
simply numeric?
Our response: The separation between LM and UM are numerical, and there are
no non-invasive biological ways to separate clearly between the two
developmental groups. There might of course be an overlap between the two
groups, but in this case the two modals were easily separated at 35 grams. This
cut-off is indicated with a dotted line in Fig. 1 b.

Feedback to the reviews of ID RSOS-181859, 18 Feb. 2019
Reviewer: 2
The revisions greatly improve the clarity of hypotheses and how this study fits into
the broader scope of the field. A few comments are listed below:
1. Page 8, Line 15: "where proactive individuals are being characterized...."
being should be removed
Our response: The part of the sentence has been removed.
2. Page 8, Line 16-20: Reword the sentence that begins "In addition, the stress
response in.....". In its current state, it is a bit confusing, especially the
portion about the low HPA or HPI axis. I know what it means, just rework for
clarity.
Our response: We agree that the sentence was difficult to read and have
separated it into two sentences.
3. Page 15, first sentence: "... reactivity axis of the pro- and reactive coping
styles /is/ ;ess rigid tha(n) previously though."
Our response: The verb had been deleted from the sentence with a mistake,
and has now been included again.
4. Page 15, final sentence of conclusion: occurring should be changed to either
"that is occurring" or "that occurs"
Our response: The sentence have been changed to “that occurs”
