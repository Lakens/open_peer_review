It's unclear how the authors plan to make the data available for publication.
Since it will not be possible to release the data because of the Twitter terms and conditions,
probably the best thing to do is to publish the ids of the tweets used for the study.

In this paper the authors study the properties of people with high communicability centrality in
Twitter and then analyze the properties of communities in this social network over time. The final
part is devoted to an agent based simulation of the system with parameters fitted with real-world
data.
I believe that the paper makes some interesting contributions, well supported by the
experimental results reported in the manuscript. However, some modifications/corrections are
needed in my opinion as discussed below.
My main concern about this work is about reproducibility of the results. I believe that the authors
should provide some details about the sentiment classification system (but probably this is not
possible for commercial reasons), or at least they should discuss how the proposed methodology
can be generalized to other types of sentiment classifiers.
The authors rightly cross-correlate their results with the SentiStrentgh2 classifier but they just say
that "the results obtained by using SentiStrength scores in general matched the ones obtained by
using the marketing agency’s scores" without reporting quantitative results. I believe that this is
necessary given the fact that the company classifier they use for the analysis is not available. Also,
the authors should provide some details about the methodology used for extracting this
crosscorrelation.
The authors present a visualization of the correlation between the two classifiers in Figure 7. It
would be very helpful to have quantitative values describing the correlation between the two
time series. The reviewer wonders why the authors did not present only results with
SentiStrenght2, since it is an open source system. Perhaps the authors might want to justify this
choice in a revised version of the manuscript.
The construction of the time-varying network is unclear to me: why did you consider just one
week for building it? In fact, it seems to me that the "reciprocal" mention (if I understood
correctly the definition of "reciprocal") might be a rare week during one week.
I really like the discussions offered by the authors about the problem of regression to the mean in
the paper in Section 3.
In Section 4.2 the authors discuss the problem of predicting the effects of introducing a new user,
but this is not really verified using real data, so it does not seem a particularly insightful result in
my opinion.
Section 4.3 seems slightly disconnected from the rest of the article. I would like to suggest to have
a generic discussion section at the end of the paper, even if I understand the focus of the special
issue. The authors should try to underline more clearly the advantages in using an agent based
3
model for this study since this is not completely clear in the current version of the manuscript.
Which kind of insights are you able to derive from this additional analysis? Alternatively, the
authors might also consider to reduce or remove this section in a revised version of the paper.
The authors should also discuss how they are going to make the data available for publication,
since this is a condition for publishing in Royal Society Open Science. One possibility is to publish
a list of the ids of the tweets used in this study.
More detailed comments:
Section 1
- "that positive and negative affect [19] that are sometimes" -> affects
Section 2
- "on a public page called a timeline, where they can be viewed by other users": this is not
completely correct. Messages are not posted on the timeline itself, but they can access by
following users and/or are visualized after retweeting. I would avoid to say "on a public page",
since it does not exist as such.
- "excluding 18/03/2015.": I suggest to indicate why that day is missing.
- "These might be robot-users who automatically generate tweets. We selected tweeting frequency
of 200 tweets per day as our threshold": how did you select this threshold? Is there any specific
reason?
- "lots of times": maybe too colloquial?
- "Users with a high ratio of in-degree to out-degree.": why did you discard them?
- Figure 1: the quality of the plot is not sufficient.
- "We used the Twitter dataset to create an evolving network, where a set of vertices is fixed and
the edges between them can change in each time-step (a day in our case).": how many
nodes/edges did you consider at the end?
- "all reciprocated tweets": what do you mean by reciprocated tweet?
Section 3
- "Fig" -> "Fig." - please check all the occurrences.
- "This gave us more tweets with which to gauge each user’s sentiment; recall that averaging over
a bigger number of tweets helps combat the “noise” in the data that is due to the limitations of
the sentiment scoring algorithm.": at the same time, this might lead to loss of information about
the actual event under observation. I believe that this aspect should be considered more carefully
by the authors.
- The reviewer wonders why the authors do not consider the average sentiment strength as a
feature. This should be clarified in a revised version of the manuscript.
- Figure 3 is not readable: I suggest to increase the font size of the picture.
4
- The readability of Figure 4 should also be improved.
- "The curve for the neutral or not detected sentiment has the same shape but inverted: initially it
rises sharply until around rank 8000, and thereafter increases slowly in an approximately linear
way.": this does not seem really surprising, since it it the complementary.
- Panel (a) of Figure 7 is hard to read.
- The readability of Figure 8 should also be improved.
Section 4
- The reference to Braess' paradox is not appropriate and should be removed.
- "i.e. influenced by the messaged it has received this step": this should be clarified.
- In Section 4.3 the authors point out that the tweets are geolocated, but the location information
is not really used throughout the paper.

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-150651)
We want to thank Reviewer 1 for his comments. Based on his remarks on potential difficulties
with reproduciblity of our results and their dependence of the commercial non-transparent
sentiment tool that we used in our analysis, we have now redone all the previously presented
results with an open source tool, and another commercial tool that is widely used in research
publications. This, we believe, strengthens substantially our paper, provides the evidence of
robustness of our results and facilitates reproducibility. The detailed response to the reviewer's
comments can be found in the new cover letter. See Appendix 1.

Dear Editor-in-Chief,
Please find enclosed our manuscript, “In the mood: the dynamics of collective
sentiments on Twitter”, which we would like to submit for publication in Royal Society
Open Science, in the special issue on City Analytics.
In this work, we analysed a large Twitter dataset. We investigated the dynamics of
collective emotions in a large network of users, looking at the relations of users’
sentiment with their communicability indices. Our analysis shows that people with
potentially the largest reach to other people in the same network over a certain period
are those with most positive sentiment scores in messages during that period.
We then identified several communities that were structurally stable over a period of
months. Community sentiment stayed relatively stable over time, and sudden changes in
most cases could be related to external events. Based on our results, we created and
calibrated a simple agent-based model that can reproduce measures of emotive
response similar to ones observed in our empirical dataset. This work was funded by UK
Defence Science and Technology Labs under Centre for Defence Enterprise grant
CDE36620 and we have obtained the clearance for publication. We plan to publish a
processed dataset containing users anonymised ids, timestamps and sentiment scores
on our web-page https://www.reading.ac.uk/CMOHB/resources/.
We have addressed the referee’s comments on an earlier version of this work as follows.
• To address the referee’s main concern about the reproducibility of our results, we have
now conducted all our analysis using three different sentiment analysis programs: the
open source program SentiStrength, the low-cost and widely cited LIWC program, and a
proprietary algorithm supplied by a digital marketing company. All sections of the paper
provide results from all three sentiment scoring algorithms, and we see that these agree
in general. Furthermore we have included tables of correlation coefficients for the three
algorithms, at tweet and community levels. Finally, we have also added a section
(Appendix A) describing the data we propose to make available with the article.
• To answer the referee’s questions about how we constructed the mentions network we
used for communicability analysis, we have added further detail around this. For
example, we explain fully the role played by reciprocated mentions in constructing the
network, and we explain why we excluded certain outlier users from our analysis (and
how we determined the thresholds for this). These extra details have been moved to
Appendix C to avoid interrupting too much the narrative of the article. We have also
added additional summary statistics for the network.
We confirm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under
consideration by any other journal. All authors have approved the manuscript and agree
with its submission to your journal. Please address all correspondence to Nathaniel
Charlton on billiejoecharlton@gmail.com and n.a.charlton@reading.ac.uk.
We look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
