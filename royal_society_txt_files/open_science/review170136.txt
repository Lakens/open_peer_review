This study explores the trade-offs between speed and accuracy in throwing strategies using an
extremely low-order mechanical model. The authors build incrementally atop this fundamental
throwing model to draw conclusions of increasing complexity, culminating in statements about
optimally accurate throwing speeds and strategies, including system uncertainties. The paper
provides a parsimonious explanation for observed human behaviors as well as a promising
framework for future studies into the mechanisms of how humans select and learn optimal
strategies.
From my standpoint, this study implies that the physical mechanics of tasks (specifically the
“error amplification properties of… parabolic flight”) are sufficiently dominant to drive the
selection of human strategies (specifically throwing). The strength of these predictions based on
a math model, with no explicit neuromuscular phenomena, make these results an important
contribution to the biomechanics and neuroscience communities. It raises questions about
whether other behaviors can be predicted via mechanics-based analyses of error propagation,
such as manipulation or locomotion. While performing this study on throwing behaviors was
important in minimizing the complexity of the analysis, I see no fundamental reason why this
analytical approach couldn’t be extended to other tasks with more degrees of freedom.
The modeling study is elegantly constructed and is careful not to include extraneous phenomena.
The choices for analysis are logical and well-explained. The curvature metric, for example, is
clearly a well-thought-out measure of accuracy. Further, the reasoning about the existence of
speed/accuracy trade-offs is built carefully and compellingly (the SI is quite thorough). The

tactile results regarding optimal strategies (e.g. throw just above the minimum speed) seem to
comport well with existing data in the literature.
The writing is polished and the figures are clean and illustrative, all despite the fact that they are
conveying analyses that are several layers deep. This is also a credit to the paper’s
logical/tutorial organization.
I do have some questions regarding stated the implications toward learning in the discussion
(and abstract). Are the authors suggesting:
(1) these results suggest a new experimental framework for probing the learning dynamics/
learning strategies of humans?
or (2) this study inspires a specific approach to learning which entails learning a “true model” via
Bayesian inference from repeated iterative observations?
Option (1) seems to have interesting implications for future classes of human-subject
experiments. However, it seems like the authors are implying Option (2): “our study naturally
points to an iterative approach for learning that first execute a plan, observe errors or
performance of the output, and use that to build an internal model.” This approach is a pretty
general learning method, and to my eye, does not obviously flow from this paper’s results or the
studied throwing phenomenon in general. Roboticists, for example, have become increasingly
enamored of learned Gaussian Process dynamic models on which they perform optimal control
methods (Deisenroth et al. 2015). I would prefer to see the authors’ meaning on “learning”
implications clarified in this part of the discussion.
Further, In section 4c, it is not clear to me that this section necessarily entails “learning.” Perhaps
“planning under model uncertainty.” While I understand that low uncertainty could correlate to
be being an “expert” or “well-learned” subject, I don’t think casting this as a learning-based
implication is the most accurate framing (for instance, the SI does a nice job casting longer
throwing distances as increased uncertainty). Learning generally implies a change in behavior or
internal model as a result of feedback, and the phenomenon of feedback is not directly addressed
in this work.

9 18 CH2 ‘‘at a speed v of’’ It will be useful to have a symbol v for speed.
We are reluctant to introduce an additional symbol, especially because v is used in a different

The calculated angles, speeds and times are not strict bounds, because they are a direct
sequence of the range of arm lengths used in the calculation. As a result, we feel that presenting
range of values as a strict bound may be misleading. Nevertheless, there were typesetting issues
ause of which the range appeared to encompass negative numbers; a long dash appeared as a
ative sign. We have now fixed that, and the text should be clearer without the use of inequalities
he reviewer helpfully suggested.

We agree with the summary of our approach, findings and their implications to activities other

I do have some questions regarding stated the implications toward learning
in the discussion (and abstract). Are the authors suggesting:
(1) these results suggest a new experimental framework for probing the
learning dynamics/ learning strategies of humans?
or (2) this study inspires a specific approach to learning which entails
learning a ‘‘true model’’ via Bayesian inference from repeated iterative
observations?
Option (1) seems to have interesting implications for future classes of
human-subject experiments. However, it seems like the authors are implying
Option (2): ‘‘our study naturally points to an iterative approach for
learning that first execute a plan, observe errors or performance of
the output, and use that to build an internal model.’’ This approach
is a pretty general learning method, and to my eye, does not obviously
flow from this paper’s results or the studied throwing phenomenon in
general. Roboticists, for example, have become increasingly enamored
of learned Gaussian Process dynamic models on which they perform optimal
control methods (Deisenroth et al. 2015). I would prefer to see the
authors’ meaning on ‘‘learning’’ implications clarified in this part of
the discussion.
We suggest that our framework for dealing with planning uncertainty may provide a means for
erimentally studying learning strategies in humans (option (1)), and also propose a broader
roach to learning (similar to option (2)). Bayesian learning models have become a mainstay
machine learning, and extensions that incorporate system dynamics for time-series analysis
ussian Process Dynamical Models are one example) are increasing in prevalence of usage. These
hods are based upon a low-dimensional “internal model” for the dynamics, and an explicit
resentation for the uncertainty of the model. An iterative scheme is used to update parameters
ociated with low-dimensional dynamical model, and with the uncertainty model.
What we propose is slightly different. The accuracy p(f|t ) depends on the dynamics, and on
planning uncertainty distribution t (f). The goal of the thrower is to implicitly learn the system
amics, i.e. learn the true p using repeated throws. We propose that because the performance
ends on both p and t , the thrower can employ t as a probe to learn p. This is what we mean
4
“an experiential understanding of Newtonian mechanics from repeated observations.” To make
clearer, we add a penultimate sentence in that paragraph, “Because the thrower’s performance
ends on both p and t , the thrower can employ t as a probe to learn the dynamics of the task,
p.”
Further, In section 4c, it is not clear to me that this section necessarily
entails ‘‘learning.’’ Perhaps ‘‘planning under model uncertainty.’’ While
I understand that low uncertainty could correlate to be being an ‘‘expert’’
or ‘‘well-learned’’ subject, I don’t think casting this as a learning-based
implication is the most accurate framing (for instance, the SI does a nice
job casting longer throwing distances as increased uncertainty). Learning
generally implies a change in behavior or internal model as a result of
feedback, and the phenomenon of feedback is not directly addressed in this
work.
We have changed the title to “Planning under uncertainty”.
Minor comments:

P10.L17 ‘‘in an expert’’ to ‘‘for an expert’’

P11.L33 ‘‘...approach for learning that first execute(s) a plan, observe(s)

The phrase ”approach” has been changed to ”approaches”, to accommodate multiple possible
izations of such a learning scheme.
