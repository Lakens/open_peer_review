Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
To Author:
The authors have generally done a satisfactory job of responding to comments, but further details
are still needed. In general, I think the manuscript would benefit from a more explicit
documentation of its limitations regarding measures of reproductive success. First, the authors
stated in their response that “we are not able to estimate clutch size”. However, in two previous
papers that they cite and that some of the present authors were a part of, clutch size is estimated
in the same study system. Second, the use of number of nestlings on day 11 as a measure of nest
success is not ideal given that it’s only about halfway through the nestling period. If that’s the
best you can do, that’s fine, but the reader should be made aware of this limitation and the
implications of this choice should be discussed. Third, more detail is needed on your measure of
body condition in relation to day of banding. Please see detailed comments below.
Lines 56-58. You still haven’t compared the strength of your effects to those found by Waite and
Strickland. How much stronger and more convincing are your effects? Also, I’m not entirely sure
it’s fair to say there was no evidence that fall temperature affected brood size in that study. They
found a negative trend of similar strength to clutch size at P = 0.08.
Lines 96-99. I still have some issues here. How long is the nestling period for Canada Jays? I’m
seeing estimates as long as 22-24 days. This means that you’re estimating nest success only
halfway through the nestling period. Do you have any evidence that nestling presence at day 11
is indicative of overall nest success at the time of fledging? From your response to previous
comments it appears not. The limitations of your definition of “success” needs to be made really
explicit to the reader. I think you need to state the length of the nesting period, why you did not
check nests after day 11, and argue to the best of your ability why your measure of nest success is
still likely to be accurate.
Lines 107-116. Do you have evidence that this is a good measure of condition (i.e., that it has
documented consequences)? If not, that’s ok as it’s a standard assumption - but you should state
that you’re making an assumption that this measures body condition.
Lines 105-106. Does excluding failed nests reduce sample size mentioned in line 96? Or is that still
accurate? Should be made clear for the reader either way.
Line 191. But above you said that “brood size” excluded failed nests. Here they are included.
Clarify. I think it makes the most sense to state how many nests failed in the methods, state that
you excluded failed nests, and then only report on the nests in the analysis in the results section
Line 192. Since you have no information about why nests fail, I think you should state that
explicitly. I think most readers are going to immediately want to know why nests are failing.
Line 192-194. Does any of this variation stem from the variation in measuring day? Looking back
to Derbyshire et al. 2015 it looks like nestlings were measured anywhere from 7 to 12 days, a
potentially big difference for fast-growing nestlings. Was day of measurement controlled for in
your body condition measure? If not, why not?
3
Line 267 – 270. In your response to previous comments you state that you were not able to
estimate clutch size. However, in Derbyshire et al. 2015 clutch size was able to be estimated for
325 of 394 nests from presumably the same data set. Why the discrepancy? If for some reason you
can’t estimate clutch size, then you need to make it explicit that you’re assuming brood size at
day 11 is representative of clutch size since the mechanism you’re mentioning here is really
focused on number of eggs laid.
Lines 272 – 274. As I mentioned in a previous review, the fact that you haven’t given any
information about how nests fail in this species makes it hard to evaluate your argument here.
Abandonment is just one way a nest could fail. What about predation, starvation, etc? I realize
are not able to determine why a nest failed, but nonetheless it seems important to understand the
mechanism and must be discussed. Is it possible that a food limited female might have a tradeoff
between time spent foraging away from the nest and time defending the nest from predators? In
this manner could food limitation decrease nest success indirectly through increased predation?
The reader needs to understand that you cannot determine why nests fail, how that limits your
understanding of the precise mechanisms behind the effects you’ve found evidence for, and what
future research is needed to clarify.
Lines 313-316. In your response to a previous comment you state that “Immediately after these
studies were published, we had a period of cold winters that have caused the observed trend to
become non-significant over time.” Ok – that makes sense, but probably should be explained so
the reader is clear on why there used to be a trend, but isn’t anymore. Moreover, if you’re doing
an analysis, shouldn’t it be in the results?
Lines 326-328. You state in your response that you don’t have any evidence that such areas where
increased in temperature and freeze-thaw event exist. This statement you make in these lines
implies that these areas definitely exist – edit text for clarification. Maybe you could be more clear
about the “pronounced climactic changes” to strengthen this oaverall argument as well?

convincing are your effects? Also, I’m not entirely sure it’s fair to say
there was no evidence that fall temperature affected brood size in
that study. They found a negative trend of similar strength to clutch
size at P = 0.08.
As suggested, we have compared the strength of the effects
in our study to those presented in Waite and Strickland
(2006) in the discussion (lines 243-247).
Lines 96-99. I still have some issues here. How long is the nestling
period for Canada Jays? I’m seeing estimates as long as 22-24 days.
This means that you’re estimating nest success only halfway through
the nestling period. Do you have any evidence that nestling presence
at day 11 is indicative of overall nest success at the time of fledging?
From your response to previous comments it appears not. The
limitations of your definition of “success” needs to be made really
explicit to the reader. I think you need to state the length of the
nesting period, why you did not check nests after day 11, and argue
to the best of your ability why your measure of nest success is still
likely to be accurate.
As suggested, we have included the length of the nesting
period in the manuscript (lines 98-99). We have also further
expressed the limitations of our nest success estimate and
why we think it is still a good indicator of success (lines 113-
118).
More generally, we do have a small sample size of
nests that were monitored until fledge. In most of these
cases, if a nest was successful at the time of banding it did
successfully fledge young. Historically, nests were not
monitored to determine if young successfully fledged due to
logistical constraints associated with accessing nests,
counting nestlings still in the nest and locating young post
fledge.
Lines 107-116. Do you have evidence that this is a good measure of
condition (i.e., that it has documented consequences)? If not, that’s
ok as it’s a standard assumption - but you should state that you’re
making an assumption that this measures body condition.
As suggested, we have stated that we assume our estimate
of condition is a good measure of body condition (lines 128-
130).
Lines 105-106. Does excluding failed nests reduce sample size
mentioned in line 96? Or is that still accurate? Should be made clear
for the reader either way.
As suggested, we have clarified that the stated mean and
range of nests monitored each year does include failed nests
(lines 96-97).
Line 191. But above you said that “brood size” excluded failed nests.
Here they are included. Clarify. I think it makes the most sense to
state how many nests failed in the methods, state that you excluded
failed nests, and then only report on the nests in the analysis in the
results section
As suggested, we have clarified that in subsequent analyses
of brood size that all failed nests were excluded (lines 168-
170). The stated range of brood size in this section of the
results is a summary of brood size across all nests.
Line 192. Since you have no information about why nests fail, I think
you should state that explicitly. I think most readers are going to
immediately want to know why nests are failing.
As suggested, we have clarified that we do not know the
cause of failure of nests in the discussion (lines 293-297).
Line 192-194. Does any of this variation stem from the variation in
measuring day? Looking back to Derbyshire et al. 2015 it looks like
nestlings were measured anywhere from 7 to 12 days, a potentially
big difference for fast-growing nestlings. Was day of measurement
controlled for in your body condition measure? If not, why not?
In Derbyshire et al. (2015), a negative exponential growth
curve was fit to the data based on known age nestlings. This
curve represented the best relationship between size and
mass of growing nestlings. This relationship is based solely
on the size and mass of an individual and therefore variation
in the age at banding does not drive variation in our
condition estimates because size is controlled for.
Line 267 – 270. In your response to previous comments you state
that you were not able to estimate clutch size. However, in
Derbyshire et al. 2015 clutch size was able to be estimated for 325 of
394 nests from presumably the same data set. Why the discrepancy?
If for some reason you can’t estimate clutch size, then you need to
make it explicit that you’re assuming brood size at day 11 is
representative of clutch size since the mechanism you’re mentioning
here is really focused on number of eggs laid.
As suggested, we have edited the text in the methods section
(lines 108-112) to reflect this uncertainty.
We cannot estimate clutch size independent of brood size
because we do not check nest contents before banding. At
the time of banding, there may be eggs in some nests, which
suggests that clutch size was larger than the observed brood
size. This is a relatively infrequent occurrence and therefore
we assume that clutch size and brood size are the same for
most nests.
Lines 272 – 274. As I mentioned in a previous review, the fact that
you haven’t given any information about how nests fail in this species
makes it hard to evaluate your argument here. Abandonment is just
one way a nest could fail. What about predation, starvation, etc? I
realize are not able to determine why a nest failed, but nonetheless it
seems important to understand the mechanism and must be
discussed. Is it possible that a food limited female might have a
tradeoff between time spent foraging away from the nest and time
defending the nest from predators? In this manner could food
limitation decrease nest success indirectly through increased
predation? The reader needs to understand that you cannot
determine why nests fail, how that limits your understanding of the
precise mechanisms behind the effects you’ve found evidence for, and
what future research is needed to clarify.
As suggested, we have explicitly stated our uncertainty as to
why nests fail and have also discussed how decreased food
quality could affect predation rates in addition to why
breeding pairs may abandon nests as they experience
decreasing food quality (line 293-297).
Lines 313-316. In your response to a previous comment you state
that “Immediately after these studies were published, we had a
period of cold winters that have caused the observed trend to become
non-significant over time.” Ok – that makes sense, but probably
should be explained so the reader is clear on why there used to be a
trend, but isn’t anymore. Moreover, if you’re doing an analysis,
shouldn’t it be in the results?
As suggested, we have indicated in the discussion why our
reported trend in mean fall temperature differs from previous
studies (lines 338-340). We have also moved the
presentation of the statistical results of our linear regression
to the results section (lines 209-211).
Lines 326-328. You state in your response that you don’t have any
evidence that such areas where increased in temperature and freeze-
thaw event exist. This statement you make in these lines implies that
these areas definitely exist – edit text for clarification. Maybe you
could be more clear about the “pronounced climactic changes” to
strengthen this oaverall argument as well?
As suggested, we have edited the text for clarification (line
354).
