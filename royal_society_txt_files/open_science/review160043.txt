The manuscript builds on a series of papers that have investigated the time allocation of seabirds
and whales foraging at various depths within the framework of central place foraging theory,
most notably Doniol-Valcroze et al. (2011).
Hypotheses:
The manuscript is structured around three hypotheses derived from central place foraging
theory. I have major questions about H2 and H3.
H2: The number of lunge feeding events during a dive should increase with dive depth.
The underlying question is whether feeding rates increase with dive depth, as noted in the
manuscript (LL 37, 77, 96). The Houston & Carbone model (1992) predicts higher feeding rates at
shallower depths because less time is required for recovery after shallow dives, as has been
shown by Doniol-Valcroze et al. (2011). This manuscript uses a different measure (i.e. the number
of lunge-feeding events per dive), but this measure is not very useful, as deep dives tend to be
longer (including more ‘bottom time’) and would therefore be expected to have more lunges per
dive even if the feeding rate did not vary by depth.
So, yes, the number of lunges per dive may increase with dive depth, but this does not tell us
anything about feeding rates over time which is much more relevant to optimal foraging. Indeed,
Fig. 3 shows that the feeding rate over time (i.e. number of lunges per hour) is much lower during
a representative sequence of deep dives vs shallow dives.
The real question here is whether the rate of net energy gain (or, next best, prey consumption) is
higher when whales are foraging deeper. This would require information on lunge rates x the
relative quantities of prey consumed during deep vs shallow lunges. It may be possible to
estimate this from the data collected in this study — this would represent a significant advance.
H3: To maximize feeding efficiency, the density of prey targeted on a given dive will increase
with depth.
Regression analysis of concurrent measurements of krill patch density and feeding lunges
indicated a strong positive relationship between feeding depth and krill density; “thus, … , the
depth of whale feeding increased as a function of krill density” (L 290 ff; Fig. 8). But this result
seems trivial given that you have already shown that prey occur at higher densities deeper in the
water column. Maybe I'm missing something, but I cannot see any plausible way one would not
get that result.
Two-step decision-making:
The two-step decision of the title is unclear – it is described three times but the three descriptions
are inconsistent.

Other major comments:
The manuscript is generally well-written, but the logical flow is difficult to follow in places. In
particular the link between the hypotheses and the data analysis summarized in the Methods
could be much clearer.
The analysis of whale foraging behavior with respect to krill distributions would benefit from a
random effects modeling approach to allow for individual variation in foraging decisions, as
hinted at in the Discussion.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Phillip Clapham):
Referee 1 has laid out, with admirable clarity, some significant issues with the interpretation of
this paper's results, notably with regard to hypotheses 2 and 3. These must be addressed,
together with other referee comments, before the paper can be considered acceptable. Referee 1's
caveats with regard to H2 and H3 are logical and do weaken the conclusions of the paper;
nonetheless, I believe this manuscript will be a useful contribution to the literature despite the
authors probably having significantly to qualify their interpretation of the data.

So, yes, the number of lunges per dive may increase with dive depth, but this does not tell us
anything about feeding rates over time which is much more relevant to optimal foraging. Indeed,
Fig. 3 shows that the feeding rate over time (i.e. number of lunges per hour) is much lower during
a representative sequence of deep dives vs shallow dives.
The real question here is whether the rate of net energy gain (or, next best, prey consumption) is

relative quantities of prey consumed during deep vs shallow lunges. It may be possible to
estimate this from the data collected in this study — this would represent a significant advance.

The manuscript now titled “Multiple-stage foraging decisions in a marine central-place forager”
represents a substantial improvement on the previous version. It is a fascinating manuscript and
will make a substantial contribution to the literature.
My major comments with respect to Hypothesis 2 have been effectively addressed, but I still have
concerns about Hypothesis 3.
The changes to Hypothesis 3 are limited, even though the authors say that they have removed
that section of the analysis. The wording of the hypothesis has been changed slightly – it now
reads “In order to maximize feeding efficiency AND OFFSET TRANSIT/SEARCH TIMES … the
density of prey targeted on a given dive will increase with increasing depth.” But the methods
and results are essentially the same as in the Individual-led analysis in the previous MS, and the
relevant discussion has not change much.
I agree that it is useful to show that whales are feeding on denser prey aggregations when they
are feeding at greater depth, because these denser aggregations offset the greater costs of deep
dives, and late-afternoon may well represent a tipping point in the diel migration of krill when
the benefit-cost ratio turns in favor of feeding. However, the results shown here are still simply
explained by the greater density of prey at greater depths and do not indicate that the whales are
actively “targeting” or selecting denser prey patches when they feed at depth or that selectivity
increases with depth (which would be consistent with optimal foraging theory). In particular, the
finding that “the depth of whale feeding increased as function of increasing krill density” (LL
316-7) is misleading because it suggests that whales dived deeper because krill was denser rather
than that krill was still relatively deep and relatively dense when whales started feeding in the
late afternoon. I therefore suggest that the authors focus on their results for Hypotheses 1 and 2,
including the results currently under Hypotheses 3 as part of the overall reporting of results
under Hypothesis 2 rather than giving them the weight of a third hypothesis.
Additional major comments:
LL 42-43. I would suggest that CPFs act to optimize overall efficiency by “maximizing net energy
gain over time”, rather than “minimizing dive costs and maximizing prey intake” because
efficiency is achieved by maximizing the difference between benefits and costs not simply
maximizing one or minimizing the other.
I think it would be worth giving greater emphasis to the increase in required recovery time
following deep dives. This is a constraint on optimal foraging for deep divers that does not have
a clear analogy for most other CPFs. I would therefore suggest highlighting it earlier, perhaps in
in paragraph 2 or 3 of the Introduction.
L 144. Hypothesis 2: I think more explanation is required here because this hypothesis only
makes sense in the context of lower prey densities at shallower depths, but this information has
not been provided yet.
LL 359-361: How does the hypothesis of increased search time when prey is concentrated at
depth correspond with the higher lunge rate per dive for deeper dives? Deep dives are longer
than shallow dives – is the lunge rate per bottom minute lower for deep dives? If so, that might
be consistent with more time spent searching at depth, but not otherwise. I think Boyd et al.
(2014) Ecological Modelling 286: 13-25 provides some relevant analysis/discussion here. I would
8
like to point you towards another paper indicating that more concentrated prey can reduce
search time if foragers know where to find it, but it is currently in review …).
The overall logical flow of this MS is much clearer than before.
Minor comments:
LL 40-41: Something missing here? How was prey availability measured?
L 42: “acts”
L144. Hypothesis 2. The phrasing here is different from in the Abstract. I suggest you use either
“increased dive depth” or “decreased dive depth” throughout, so that the difference between you
hypothesis and your finding is clear.
L 215 and elsewhere. There are several references to “area of the water column”, which I found
confusing. Perhaps a different term would be clearer, e.g. “percent of the water column
occupied” or similar?
L 249 ‘THE’ is capitalized.
L 342: “as demonstrated by Ware …”?
L 343: Is this predicted by optimal foraging theory or does it rather reflect a physiological
constraint on optimal foraging (i.e. increased recovery times that imply lower feeding rates when
whales are feeding at depth)? (See also comment at L 144.)
L 349: “maintain”
L 349: Does “this latter strategy” refer to strategy (2) at L 333?

Apologies that my previous comment at L 303 was unclear – there was an extra period, which is
no longer there.

data and therefore I recommend this paper for publication with minor revisions.
Further explanation on the sampling of the prey field relative to the location of the tagged whale
would be useful. As currently written, it is difficult for the reader to understand how close in space
and time the prey sampling was conducted relative to the location of the tagged whale. The last
sentence in the manuscript addresses that it was not possible to map the patch of krill at the same
period of time a whale is feeding on it but there are no specific details provided in the manuscript.
Comments:
Title: I suggest providing a bit more in the title so the reader knows you are discussing a central place
forager in the marine environment.
Line 33-34 – is this correct? Should this be daytime foraging? You data suggests that whales are
diving shallower on more dispersed pretty at night.
Line 48 – missing ‘of’ before ‘costs’ and maximizing should be ‘maximize’
Lines 68-71 – Awkward sentence. This would be better as two sentences.
Line 76 – breathe not breath
Line 77 – I’m not sure I understand ‘increase feeding rates in energy gain’ - do you mean increase
feeding rates, and therefore energy gain?
Line 93 – I assume you mean that the prediction has not been tested in the marine environment?
Line 103: Not sure where you get ‘12’?? I would just stick to ‘Mysticetes have evolved….’
Line 110: Reference year should be 2012 according to bibliography
Line 122: Don’t think you need ‘continental shelf’ twice in this sentence, just that krill were ‘patchily
distributed from nearshore areas out to the continental shelf were spawning occurs’
Line 154: delete ‘were’ – as is, it sounds like you sampled the tags at 50Hz
Line 159: delete ‘both’
Line 171: this is same reference as on line 167 but in different format. You are also missing ‘;’
between references
Lines 180-183: This is a bit confusing. Sounds like you mapped prey from the zodiac AND the ship?
So you had repeat measurements during the day but only 1 measurement from the ship at night?
Line 214: I assume you mean to say ‘mean’ hourly krill patch depth and ‘mean’ hourly krill patch
density?
Lines 215-218: You already stated that you used MOCNESS on line 157 of the methods. Just state
the analysis you used for this data in this sentence
Line 217: Missing Espinasse et al 2012 reference in bibliography
Lines 227-228: This is confusing – consider using a figure – I don’t understand the ‘within a vertical
distance of 10 m, extending 15 mins before and after’. A vertical distance of 10 m to what?
Line 245: CI missing unit
Line 257: Were the krill primarily superba?
Lines 259-261: below this? What is ‘this’ referencing to. This is confusing, please be more specific.
According to your figure, there was an increase in the average size of krill with increasing depth up
to 150-200 m. However, below 200 m,…
Line 265: I assume this should reference figure 6 not 5. I think you have figure 5 and 6 reversed and
that Line 281 should reference figure 5 rather than 6.
Line 272: local time? GMT?
Line 282: What time are you considering late afternoon? 2pm?
Line 292: I would remove ‘strong’
Line 303: Example is oddly worded. Remove double period
Line 305: aswsociated? – very original spelling =). Also there is not Goldbogen et al 2007 reference in
your bibliography.
Lines 317-322: This sentence seems contradictory to your previous statements that say whales don’t
dive deep during day. Is this sentence saying that within a single dive that an animal will increase its
depth if the food layer gets deeper?
Line 330: Espinasse et al 2012 reference missing from bibliography.
Line 375: Year in parenthesis
Line 381: Missing Burns et al (2011) and Fraser and Hofmann (2003) reference from bibliography.
Also, delete extra parenthesis
Need to work on formatting in-text citations – lots of inconsistencies:
- Et al is sometimes italicised and sometimes not
- Sometimes you have ‘and’ and others you have ‘&’
- Sometimes you list names of three authors and other times you use et al when there are
three authors
- Witteveen et al (2008) is in bibliography but never cited in text
Table 1: This table is necessary. The values are provided in the text.
Table 2: This table is confusing and it is unclear what the reader should take away from this. Also,
200-325 as on figure 4. Letters indicate similar mean? How? Is this a test of significance? Please
elaborate.
Figure 1: Since you mention Gerlache Strait in the legend, please label this on the map. It would also
be helpful to state that white is water, black is land, and grey is ice shelf? Also, while it is a beautiful
image, I do not find that the photo of the humpback whale adds anything to the figure itself.
Figure 2: I don’t understand the information in parenthesis ‘(to the midpoint of the patch in m)’
means? I think you are saying ‘hourly depth (m) distribution of krill patches (based on the midpoint
of each patch)’ or something along those lines. It would be really helpful if you could distinguish the
daytime and night-time hours on these graphs.
Figure 3: seems very disjoint, like the first two panels were made by one person and the last two by
a different person. Consistency between panels would be very helpful in terms of axis, units, and
labels. I assume I the last two panels, based on time, you are showing the comparison between
night and day diving just like you were comparting night and day krill patches above. Please clarify.
Figure 7: Just wanted to verify that the horizontal line represent mean since boxplots usually show
median. Also it would be helpful if you also included numbers at the top for the columns that don’t
have data so someone knows that you had data but animals were not conducting foraging dives.
Again, distinguishing day and night hours would be helpful

Dear Dr. Clapham,
On behalf of my co-authors, I am pleased to re-submit our manuscript ‘Multiple-stage
foraging decisions in a marine central-place forager’, by Ari S. Friedlaender et al.
to Royal Society Open Science. Our study presents unique information on the diving
behavior and foraging decisions of a marine central place forager. Specifically, we
examine the effects of both prey density and depth on the diving behavior, foraging
rates, and foraging decisions of humpback whales. Several of our results concur with
model-derived predictions of how diving animals foraging in a manner consistent with
Optimal Foraging Theory. Furthermore, we advance our understanding of the foraging
ecology of diving air-breathing predators by conducting simultaneous prey surveys
when whales were feeding. Concurrent and quantitative measures of prey availability
and predator behavior in marine environments is a challenging endeavor that we have
overcome, particularly at the spatio-temporal scale that is relevant to predator
foraging behavior. We place our work in the broader context of optimal foraging
theory for air-breathing diving animals and provide valuable insights that can be used
to further understand the decisions that predators make when foraging. We feel that
this work has broad appeal across taxonomic groups, environments, and researchers
interested in behavioral ecology and foraging theory. We were very pleased with the
comments and constructive criticisms of the two reviewers and believe that with their
contributions, we have made our manuscript more accurate and better quality.
Reviewer 2 in particular helped guide a new strategy for presenting our hypotheses and
strengthened the rigor of our work through their efforts. We greatly appreciate it. We
look forward to working with you to publish our work in Royal Society Open Science. My
apologies for this taking longer than expected to be returned. Between field seasons,
conferences and now back in the field in Antarctica, time slipped.
Below are the revisions that we have made to each Reviewer comment.
Reviewer 1
Title: As suggested by the reviewer we have changed the title to ‘Multiple-stage foraging
decisions in a marine central-place forager’.
Line 33-34: our text reads ‘whales initiated feeding as krill underwent a crepuscular diel vertical
migration towards the surface, feeding throughout the night largely on shallow prey that was
more dispersed than during the day’. The whales indeed are feeding at night on more shallow
and dispersed krill than are available during the day.
Line 48: we have changed our text to read ‘Animals have evolved multiple strategies to
optimize searching for prey and maximize net energy gain with respect to costs associated with
acquiring energy’ to simplify the statement.
Line 76: change made
Line 77: the sentence is written such that as feeding rates increase so to, consequently, does
energy gain. The reviewer is correct.
Line 93: our text states what the reviewer is asking with respect to marine systems: ‘most
studies of marine predator behavioral ecology have been forced to make assumptions about
the potential effects of prey distribution and abundance in the absence of empirical data’.
Line 103: changed as requested
Line 110: changed
Line 122: we have changed the text to read ‘During this period whale distribution is primarily
related to that of their prey (Friedlaender et al. 2006; Friedlaender et al. 2011), and krill are
patchily distributed from nearshore areas out to the continental shelf where spawning occurs
(Nicol 2006).’
Line 154: changed
Line 159: changed
Line 171: changed
Line 180-183: We did map prey from both ships at the same time to increase our sampling of
prey concurrent to when whales were tagged. They were not repeat measures as the ships
worked in different areas around the tagged whale; different spatial scales. At night, the prey
mapping was only done from the larger ship.
Line 214: line: the reviewer is correct that we meant ‘mean’.
Line 215-218: we have deleted that text so that we only describe the net sampling and analysis
once in line 209-213.
Line 217: reference added
Line 227-228: we feel that we have suitably described the analytical process of ‘we created a
spatial and temporal envelope around each feeding lunge to draw a concurrent measurement
of prey for our analyses and to account for any uncertainty associated with the whale’s
position. This spatio-temporal envelope encompasses the distance that whales travel between
feeding dives as well as the time of the longest feeding dives recorded in our data (Friedlaender
et al. 2013). Krill patches occurring within these spatio-temporal boundaries were sampled for
their density (Sv)…’
Line 245: added CI for all numbers
Line 257: the krill were all E. superba ‘From MOCNESS tows, we found a single unimodal
size/age class (4.2 +/- 0.6 cm) of Euphausia superba that dominated the sample (Nowacek et al.
2011). ‘
Line 259-261: we have clarified to be below the 200 meter depth
Line 265: changed
Line 272: changed to local time
Line 282: we have added the times 1400-1600
Line 292: removed
Line 303: done
Line 305: we have used a more traditional spelling and added the reference to the final
literature cited
Line 317-322:
Line 330: added to the references
Line 375: done
Line 381: added
Table 1: we assume the reviewer meant unnecessary and we concur and have removed the
table.
Table 2: we indicate the statistical test used and that similar letters refer to statistically similar
mean krill lengths.
Figure 1: we have changed the legend to the following ‘Study area of Wilhelmina Bay (open
box) adjacent to the Gerlache Strait, Western Antarctic Peninsula. Black areas are land, white is
water, and grey are ice shelves.’ We have removed the photograph.
Figure 2: We have modified the legend to read ‘Hourly distributions mean krill patch depth (m)
patch height (m)…’. We indicate the periods of day versus night time in the text.
We have revised the legends for Figure 3A and 3B as follows. ‘Figure 3A. Representative
echograms showing krill patch distribution and relative density for a two-hour period at night
(top) and day (bottom). Data are from May 13, 2010 in Wilhelmina Bay. The color scale from
red-yellow-green-blue reflects high to low relative krill densities. Daytime patches were
significantly deeper and denser, while covering a smaller portion of the water column than
nighttime patches.
Figure 3B. Humpback whale dive data and feeding events for two-hour periods during night
(top) and day (bottom). The black line indicates whale depth and red circles indicate lunge
feeding events. During the night, whales make more repeated shallow dives with fewer feeding
lunges per dive while during the day whales make fewer, deeper dives with more feeding
lunges per dive. ‘
We have also edited the plots to be more similar in design and presentation.
Figure 7: we have added numbers for whales that were feeding during each hour and indicated
the number of tagged whales for the hours during which no feeding occurred.
Reviewer 2
From the Reviewer: the manuscript builds on a series of papers that have investigated the time
allocation of seabirds and whales foraging at various depths within the framework of central
place foraging theory, most notably Doniol-Valcroze et al. (2011).
Hypotheses:
The manuscript is structured around three hypotheses derived from central place foraging
theory. I have major questions about H2 and H3.
H2: The number of lunge feeding events during a dive should increase with dive depth.
The underlying question is whether feeding rates increase with dive depth, as noted in the
manuscript (LL 37, 77, 96). The Houston & Carbone model (1992) predicts higher feeding rates
at shallower depths because less time is required for recovery after shallow dives, as has been
shown by Doniol-Valcroze et al. (2011). This manuscript uses a different measure (i.e. the
number of lunge-feeding events per dive), but this measure is not very useful, as deep dives tend
to be longer (including more ‘bottom time’) and would therefore be expected to have more
lunges per dive even if the feeding rate did not vary by depth.
So, yes, the number of lunges per dive may increase with dive depth, but this does not tell us
anything about feeding rates over time which is much more relevant to optimal foraging.
Indeed, Fig. 3 shows that the feeding rate over time (i.e. number of lunges per hour) is much
lower during a representative sequence of deep dives vs shallow dives.
The reviewer is absolutely correct here and points out what was a very important facet of our
work that did not get communicated well. In light of this, we have revised and refined our
hypotheses, analyses, and discussion accordingly. We have included a new analysis that
determines the feeding rates of tagged whales (expressed as mean number of lunges per
tagged whale per hour) rather than the simple measure of lunges per dive compared with dive
depth. This is a significant change and one that has allowed us to refine the focus of the paper
in a very useful and logical way and we appreciate the Reviewer’s diligence in this regard.
In our results we present: Feeding rates, the numbers of lunges per hour, for all animals are
shown in Figure 7. Similar to dive depth, we find that when whales began feeding in late
afternoon, foraging rates were lowest and increased into the evening and then remained
relatively stable throughout the night until whales stopped foraging in the morning. We found
a significant (R2 = 0.59, p<0.003) relationship between feeding rates (mean number of feeding
dives per whale per hour) and feeding dive depth with the highest feeding rates occurring at
the shallowest feeding depths (Figure 8).
The real question here is whether the rate of net energy gain (or, next best, prey consumption) is
higher when whales are foraging deeper. This would require information on lunge rates x the
relative quantities of prey consumed during deep vs shallow lunges. It may be possible to
estimate this from the data collected in this study — this would represent a significant advance.
Again the Reviewer is correct that this would be the true way to determine foraging rates, but
clearly there is no way to determine the amount of prey consumed on a given dive and how this
is affected by prey density. This would indeed be a significant advance and is far beyond the
scope of our paper. However, we believe that we have taken a significant step forward by
collecting, including, and accounting for prey density/availability in the study of baleen whale
foraging ecology.
H3: To maximize feeding efficiency, the density of prey targeted on a given dive will increase
with depth.
Regression analysis of concurrent measurements of krill patch density and feeding lunges
indicated a strong positive relationship between feeding depth and krill density; “thus, … , the
depth of whale feeding increased as a function of krill density” (L 290 ff; Fig. 8). But this result
seems trivial given that you have already shown that prey occur at higher densities deeper in
the water column. Maybe I'm missing something, but I cannot see any plausible way one would
not get that result.
The reviewer is correct again and we have removed that section of our analysis in favor of the
feeding rates relative to depth that the Reviewer suggested earlier.
Two-step decision-making:
The two-step decision of the title is unclear – it is described three times but the three
descriptions are inconsistent.
We have made this more consistent in the abstract and discussion. From the Discussion, we
now state that: ‘our results suggest that humpback whales foraging late in the feeding season
around the WAP do so in a manner that is consistent with optimal foraging to maximize energy
intake in two ways: 1) by generally feeding at shallow depths during nighttime hours when krill
are shallow to increase feeding rates, and, 2) when they do have to dive deeper, targeting
denser prey patches that contain larger individual krill. This two-step foraging decision in a
central place forager demonstrates ways in which the behavioral ecology these predators act to
optimize overall efficiency by minimizing diving costs and maximizing prey intake. These data
reveal a previously unrecognized level of complexity in predator-prey interactions in marine
predators and underscores the need to study foraging behavior and prey distribution
simultaneously.’
Other major comments:
the link between the hypotheses and the data analysis summarized in the Methods could be
much clearer.
We have restructured our hypotheses and analyses:
Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that: 1) whales should feed at times and in areas
(depths) of relatively high prey density (Goldbogen et al. 2011); 2) FEEDING RATES WILL
INCREASE WITH DECREASING DIVE DEPTH TO OPTIMIZE ENERGY GAIN (Doniol-Valcroze et al.
2011); and 3) in order to maximize feeding efficiency AND OFFSET TRANSIT/SEARCH TIMES (e.g.
Mori 1998), the density of prey targeted on a given dive will increase with INCREASING depth.
Understanding these relationships have wide-ranging implications for understanding the
mechanisms that govern predator-prey interactions, the behavioral ecology, and our ability to
test theories of optimal foraging in aquatic air-breathing animals.
And we have changed our sub-headings to reflect the Hypotheses that each reflects and have
discarded the ‘individual-level’ and ‘population-level’ headers.
The analysis of whale foraging behavior with respect to krill distributions would benefit from a
random effects modeling approach to allow for individual variation in foraging decisions, as
hinted at in the Discussion.
We absolutely agree with the reviewer but given our sample size, we were not able to complete
a mixed-effect model with a random effect.
We have also made all of the minor edits suggested by the Reviewer and describe those below.
Abstract:
Line 52: changed
Line 57: we have added Pyke et al. 1977, and Bryant and Turner 1982)
Line 71: removed citation
Line 105: changed
Line 127: changed to ‘towards the end of the feeding season…’
Line 130: changed to ‘However, an understanding of how the distribution and behavior of krill
affects this observed behavior remains unstudied’
Line 133: we agree with the reviewer and have tried to include in this sentence the sentiment
that ‘rate of energy intake’ is the critical metric.
Line 159: we have added Hooker et al. 2001
Line 169: we account for any accuracy/precision differences in our spatial and temporal buffer
Line 185: we have added the following ‘A clover-leaf survey pattern with the whale at the
center was performed whenever possible. In this method, the echosounders would pass by the
known location of a whale as close as possible and as soon after it had dove. Prey surveys
generally expanded radially out from the whale’s location to a distance of 500 meters. If the
whale was traveling, we would perform a zig-zag survey behind the whale in its path. If the
whale was not visible but could be localized with radio-tracking equipment, surveys were
designed adaptively to try and survey the most likely places the whale was (or had been)
feeding.’
Line 194: we have changed to the suggested text
Line 204: we are only talking about krill here.
Line 206: we discuss this in the krill dynamics paragraph and it is used to describe day/night
differences in krill patch structure
Line 207: This refers to time (120 seconds), we used this rather than an absolutely distance
traveled/covered, although these are quite similar given the near-constant speed of surveys,
but the course was not always in one direction.
Line 214: we refer to mean patch depth in this case.
Line 215: we do mean ‘mean’ and have added that language.
Line 216: changed as suggested.
Line 221: this is a good suggestion that we will add in our discussion.
Line 234: we changed the language to better represent the different hypotheses and tests that
were performed and how these are specific to data from individual whales or from the entire
data set of whales that was tagged. Appreciate the comment.
Line 265: corrected.
Line 272: we believe that the Figure 6 from Friedlaender et al. contains a small number of dives
(4) that in the original analysis were deemed to be feeding dives but upon further evaluation
were exploratory dives without consistent tag metrics indicative of feeding. We apologize for
any confusion.
Line 303: unclear what the comment relates to.
Line 305: changed.
Line 311: changed as suggested.
Line 312: we have changed quality to density.
Line 333: we agree that this is an interesting finding and without a more comprehensive prey
sampling strategy it is difficult to reproduce a spatially-explicit horizontal image of krill density.
Nowacek et al. 2011 shows the broad-scale horizontal extent of the greater prey patch within
the bay.
Line 373: changed.
Line 400: Our sample size for individual whales with concurrent prey measurements limited our
ability to use them as a random effect for a full-scale GAMM. Ideally, this is precisely what we
would have done.
Line 401: changed as suggested.
Line 403: changed.
Line 422: we have included the suggested statement
Line 434: changed as suggested.

Dear Editor,
On behalf of my co-authors, I am pleased to send minor revisions back on our
manuscript ‘Multiple-stage decisions in a marine central-place forager’, by Ari S.
Friedlaender et al. to Royal Society Open Science. We were very pleased with your
decision to accept the manuscript with minor revisions. We have considered all of the
comments of the two reviewers, and have made all of their changes accordingly.
Below we provide our specific responses.
Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript now titled “Multiple-stage foraging decisions in a marine central-place
forager” represents a substantial improvement on the previous version. It is a fascinating
manuscript and will make a substantial contribution to the literature.
My major comments with respect to Hypothesis 2 have been effectively addressed, but
I still have concerns about Hypothesis 3.
The changes to Hypothesis 3 are limited, even though the authors say that they have
removed that section of the analysis. The wording of the hypothesis has been changed
slightly – it now reads “In order to maximize feeding efficiency AND OFFSET
TRANSIT/SEARCH TIMES … the density of prey targeted on a given dive will increase with
increasing depth.” But the methods and results are essentially the same as in the
Individual-led analysis in the previous MS, and the relevant discussion has not change
much.
I agree that it is useful to show that whales are feeding on denser prey aggregations
when they are feeding at greater depth, because these denser aggregations offset the
greater costs of deep dives, and late-afternoon may well represent a tipping point in
the diel migration of krill when the benefit-cost ratio turns in favor of feeding. However,
the results shown here are still simply explained by the greater density of prey at greater
depths and do not indicate that the whales are actively “targeting” or selecting denser
prey patches when they feed at depth or that selectivity increases with depth (which
would be consistent with optimal foraging theory). In particular, the finding that “the
depth of whale feeding increased as function of increasing krill density” (LL 316-7) is
misleading because it suggests that whales dived deeper because krill was denser
rather than that krill was still relatively deep and relatively dense when whales started
feeding in the late afternoon. I therefore suggest that the authors focus on their results
for Hypotheses 1 and 2, including the results currently under Hypotheses 3 as part of the
overall reporting of results under Hypothesis 2 rather than giving them the weight of a
third hypothesis.
We understand the issue raised by Reviewer 1 and have compressed our hypotheses
and discussions points as suggested. We have removed Hypothesis 3 and that portion
of the Introduction now reads:
“Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that: 1) whales should feed at times and in
areas (depths) of relatively high prey density (Goldbogen et al. 2011); and 2) if prey
density is consistent, feeding rates will increase with decreasing dive depths to optimize
the rate of energy gain (Doniol-Valcroze et al. 2011). As well, we are interested in
whether a relationship exists between increasing dive depth and increasing prey
density (e.g. Mori 1998).”
We have also merged the results and discussion of information from previous Hypothesis
3 with the other hypotheses. We have also changed the text in line 316-7 to “Thus, for
individual lunges performed within or across dives, the depth of whale feeding
increased with increasing krill density”.
Additional major comments:
LL 42-43. I would suggest that CPFs act to optimize overall efficiency by “maximizing net
energy gain over time”, rather than “minimizing dive costs and maximizing prey intake”
because efficiency is achieved by maximizing the difference between benefits and
costs not simply maximizing one or minimizing the other.
We have changed this text as suggested.
I think it would be worth giving greater emphasis to the increase in required recovery
time following deep dives. This is a constraint on optimal foraging for deep divers that
does not have a clear analogy for most other CPFs. I would therefore suggest
highlighting it earlier, perhaps in in paragraph 2 or 3 of the Introduction.
We have changed our text to this effect: “Specifically, marine predators must account
for the energetic costs of having to return to the surface to breath air between foraging
dives, unlike terrestrial or aerial predators. This translates into increased energy
expenditure during foraging for air-breathing marine predators as well as the need to
recover oxygen stores while at the surface after deep dives.”
L 144. Hypothesis 2: I think more explanation is required here because this hypothesis
only makes sense in the context of lower prey densities at shallower depths, but this
information has not been provided yet.
We have augmented this text to read: “if prey density is consistent, feeding rates will
increase with decreasing dive depths to optimize the rate of energy gain (Doniol-
Valcroze et al. 2011).” We believe that there is suitable introduction of this theme in the
introduction and in the literature that we have cited as the basis for the hypothesis.
LL 359-361: How does the hypothesis of increased search time when prey is
concentrated at depth correspond with the higher lunge rate per dive for deeper
dives? Deep dives are longer than shallow dives – is the lunge rate per bottom minute
lower for deep dives? If so, that might be consistent with more time spent searching at
depth, but not otherwise. I think Boyd et al. (2014) Ecological Modelling 286: 13-25
provides some relevant analysis/discussion here. I would like to point you towards
another paper indicating that more concentrated prey can reduce search time if
foragers know where to find it, but it is currently in review …).
This is an interesting thought and the Boyd et al. (2014) manuscript does provide an
example. Unfortunately for us (but fortunately for the reviewer!) we will have to wait
until the manuscript in review, that they mention, is published. Perhaps our study will
provide an opportunity to highlight the differences in their study to what we have found
in humpback whales in Antarctica.
The overall logical flow of this MS is much clearer than before.
We appreciate this.
Minor comments:
LL 40-41: Something missing here? How was prey availability measured?
We have added the echosounder methods in the text here.
L 42: “acts”
done
L144. Hypothesis 2. The phrasing here is different from in the Abstract. I suggest you use
either “increased dive depth” or “decreased dive depth” throughout, so that the
difference between you hypothesis and your finding is clear.
We have tried to be consistent with this terminaology throughout.
L 215 and elsewhere. There are several references to “area of the water column”, which
I found confusing. Perhaps a different term would be clearer, e.g. “percent of the water
column occupied” or similar?
We have changed this to percentage of the water column as suggested.
L 249 ‘THE’ is capitalized.
done
L 342: “as demonstrated by Ware …”?
Edited for the proper citation.
L 343: Is this predicted by optimal foraging theory or does it rather reflect a physiological
constraint on optimal foraging (i.e. increased recovery times that imply lower feeding
rates when whales are feeding at depth)? (See also comment at L 144.)
See above, but we did not include an analysis of surface times after dives in our
methodology.
L 349: “maintain”
done
L 349: Does “this latter strategy” refer to strategy (2) at L 333?
Changed to be more obvious
Previous minor comments:
Apologies that my previous comment at L 303 was unclear – there was an extra period,
which is no longer there.
Ok.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
Manuscript RSOS-150353 entitled ‘Two-step decisions of a central-place forager’
examines foraging decisions of humpback whales driven by krill depth and density.
While I found the manuscript quite impression during my initial review, I think the
changes the authors’ made to the original submission further improved the quality of
the paper and that it is suitable for publication after a few minor revisions.
Comments:
It would be useful to add a sentence under the hypotheses sections in results
that states whether your hypothesis was rejected or supported. –for clarity.
We state that our results are consistent with previous models and support optimal
foraging which we think provides sufficient clarity.
Line 33: Found, not find
done
Line 34-35: awkward phrasing: Consider something like, “….feeding rates were greatest
when prey was shallowest with feeding rates significantly decreasing with increasing
dive depth’
Changed as suggested
Lines 181: comma after ‘deployments’
done
Lines 182-184: In response to reviewer 1 (lines 180-183), the authors state that they
mapped prey from both ships at the same time (both ships during day and only big ship
at night). However, they then changed the text to state that only the zodiac was used
during the day and that the large ship at night. Please clarify one more time.
We have clarified this: two ships during the daylight hours, and one ship at night for prey
mapping.
Line 249: un-capitalize ‘the’
done
Line 305: consider semi-colon instead of ‘,’ after ‘afternoon’
done
Line 399: I think you are missing an ‘of’ after ecology.
done
Line 359: I think this text is reversed. Shouldn’t it say: “This suggests that diving deeper to
locate denser krill patches may not be as efficient as……..”??
done
Lines 396: you have ‘increase feeding rates” twice
done
Figure 9: It would be helpful to add a sentence or two in your results/discussion that talks
about the difference in depth and density between 2009 and 2010. Also, line
712 – need space between ‘feeding’ and ‘lunges’. Does ‘individual’ mean that there is
data from only 1 whale on each of the plots?
Done for both.
Once again, we are very pleased to be able to publish our research in Royal Society
Open Science, and appreciate the thoughtful efforts of the reviewers and editors
towards helping us achieve this. Please contact me with any further questions.
