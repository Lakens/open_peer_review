Review of Personality in semi-captive Asian elephants, submitted to Royal Society Open Science.
The ms presents an interesting study on a species not yet much studied for individual differences.
The sample is quite large, but the methods are weak. Only questionnaires were used, inter-rater
agreement is absent for more than a third of the scales used and no behavioural data are
provided to validate the findings. Moreover, the theoretical background is not well researched
and linked to the present study.
I provide my comments in chronological order.
Abstract
Why are long-lived, highly-social wild mammals with high cognitive abilities interesting and
worthwhile being studied for personality differences, what can we learn from this? This should
be elaborated and explained to the reader.
In the abstract, the description of the methods and data collected is not clear at all.
What are “behavioural traits” and how were they scored – or did you mean rating items?
What means the statement that “multiple questionnaires” were used, did you use different ones
or just asked multiple raters per elephant to complete the same questionnaire?
How did you count the total of 496 ratings, are these single scores or numbers of questionnaires
completed?
Why are 221 elephants reported here when the data eventually reflect just those of 158? This is
still a very large sample. Drop out in field studies is always high but reporting should be accurate
and not mislead readers to assume the sample be 50% larger.
How can you conclude that elephants “expressed five personality factors”? The ratings capture
what the raters think about the elephants studied but not about how the elephants have actually
behaved. Countless attribution biases are known to occur in ratings of human and animal
individuals. Moreover, factors are statistical constructs, nothing that could be found in nature.
l. 63
The idea that behavioural ratings “can serve as an integrated measurement of individual
behaviour over a longer time period [8] and allow to collect a whole set of different behaviours
instead of only one or two items of interest” devalues the efforts of behavioural researchers
needed to study how animals really behave. Importantly, it ignores the well-known and
profound memory biases of humans as well social constructions of ideas about animal behaviour.
How many myths about animal behaviour were shown to be not true? This could be unravelled
only with through behavioural research, not with simple personality questionnaires.
3
l. 72
The literature is not well researched. There are numerous species other than primates who were
studied with personality questionnaires, not only dolphins. There are also studies on elephant
personality (e.g., by Phyllis Lee in 2012) not cited here.
l. 102
Why does the semi-captive population of working elephants provide a sound basis for looking at
individual differences in a long-lived species? In what ways can findings from these elephants be
generalised to wild and other captive elephants? What justifies the assumption that elephants
forced to work all day can express their natural behaviours to a large extend? Sure, their
environments may be more natural than those of zoo elephants but the latter are not forced to
work all day. The argumentation about the sample is not very convincing and some claims made
are not well justified.
l. 197
Why were there so many missing ratings? This could be an indicator that the raters have not fully
understood the items or found them not applicable to the elephants? The findings that raters with
incomplete questionnaires were mostly younger and less experienced speaks for this idea.
L. 238
Interrater reliability analysis is a means to test, if the raters agreed sufficiently well in their
assessments of the individuals under study. It is a quality criterion and therefore has to exceed a
certain value. 12 out of 31 items did not even exceed ICC (3,k) > .30, many of them almost zero.
Thus, these items failed the quality criterion needed for questionnaire data to be meaningful at
all. That is, most items used had clearly insufficient reliability scores, the raters did not agree at
all in how they assessed the individuals. This entails that all subsequent analyses are based on
unreliable data, which compromises the reliability and validity of all further findings reported.
This data set clearly does not meet the high-quality criteria of a journal like Royal Society Open
Science.
In ICC(3,k), the number of raters k included in these analyses should be indicated in the results
section and the table.
Why were the data from different years lumped together? Personality changes, maybe that’s why
no sufficient reliability could be achieved.
Why were in the items adjective and behavioural ratings lumped together? it’s been shown that
both are rated very differently and do not always agree well. Maybe this added to the extremely
low and even absent inter-rater reliability in more than a third of the items.
l. 257 How could a construct “seriousness” be meaningful for animals? I don’t think that such
terms are useful in animal research and the items to which it relates empirically in this unreliable
data set are not well interrelated theoretically.
In ll. 333 seriousness is explained as reflecting the “attitude or state of the individual”. Attitudes
and states are two VERY different concepts. Moreover, asking people to rate elephants on
personality questionnaires is not a measurement of the elephants’ attitudes to work.
l., 335
“Seriousness resembles conscientiousness from human personality literature, which reflects
rationality and competence”. This is a misrepresentation of the human literature. In what ways
are the items “slow, obedient or inventive”, to which this construct refers in the present study
(see ll. 266) related to conscientiousness?
4
l. 338 here finally some papers on personality in elephants are mentioned, this belongs to a
proper literature review in the introduction, especially given that this field is still quite small.
Not every questionnaire study can yield meaningful results and this seems the case in the study
presented. The item selection should be systematically improved until a useful and valid
questionnaire is developed. Validity requires evidence of systematic relations to observable
behaviour, at least in a subsample. This has not been done. Moreover, the agreement between the
raters is far too low and even completely absent for more than a third of the items. The agreement
evidenced here is ways below chance levels, thus reflecting random patterns, so that all
subsequent analyses are compromised and no evidence for their reliability or validity provided.
The authors mention data from several years, but analyses of temporal consistency is not
provided, which could provide some evidence for reliability. But this has not been done either.
Therefore, the findings could simply indicate some semantic relationships between the items
presented without having any relations to the elephants individuals studied. I cannot recommend
this study for publication given this insufficient data base.

This paper examines personality ratings in a semi-free population of Asian elephants. The paper
makes a novel and solid contribution to the growing literature on animal personality and should
be of wide interest. In general, the paper is very strong as it is based on large sample sizes, uses
rigorous data analysis and draws mostly appropriate interpretations.
I have following comments:
Abstract: The authors state in the abstract that the study is based on 221 elephants. However, this
is not actually the case. They attempted to collect data on 221elephants but due to very good
5
reasons (questionnaires not filled completely) they excluded (correctly) some of the individuals
from all analyses conducted in the paper, including the personality assessment and the
subsequent comparison between sexes and ages. The remaining N=158 is still an impressive
sample size. Therefore, I think it would be of no harm to state 158 as the sample size in the
abstract of the final paper.
Introduction and Methods: I found the framing of the methods used a little bit confusing. The
two principal methods are usually (e.g. Gosling 2001) referred to as behavioral coding (referred to
as “direct behavioral measurements of the focal individual” in current ms.) and
questionnaire/trait ratings (referred to as “behavioral ratings” in the ms.). The authors clearly
used questionnaire ratings, with all items accompanied by behavioral definitions. I know that the
questionnaire approach has been criticized in animal personality research, but the authors
themselves support the use of this method using relevant arguments and by citing appropriate
literature. Also, the behavioral definition has been used in previous questionnaire based studies. I
see no need to use another term. Using the term “behavioral” instead of the questionnaire/trait
term makes it confusing (especially in the introduction and the compared to methods).
Results: Inter-rate reliability is not very high. Would it make any difference to exclude some of
the raters that have very limited exposure to the focal elephants (one month seems rather low)? I
am also curious as to why (on average) each mahout rated only two elephants, given that there
are usually more elephants in each camp. Having multiple ratings on each elephant should also
increase the inter-rater reliabilities.
Results: Personality structure.
Labelling the components is always tricky and subjective. I have slight doubts about the
Dominance and Neuroticism components. First, the item dominant has the word “aggressive” in
the definition. It is generally not recommended to use the name of another item in the item
definition, and also some authors have questioned whether dominance should be defined on the
basis of aggression. Thus, it is not surprising than that the two items dominant and aggressive
ended up in one component. This component thus might reflect more aggressiveness then
dominance. Moreover, the item subordinate did not load on the same component (which is
usually the case in many studies that used the two (dominant and subordinate), as it is the
antonym to the dominant). Thus one might actually see Neuroticism, where the subordinate item
loaded as the reverse of Dominance (with other items (fearful, timid, and impulsive) complying
with the interpretation). The authors might re-consider the interpretations or discuss some of the
issues.
Table 2 would benefit from reordering the items on the basis of the loading values salient to each
component.
Discussion:
p 17. Neuroticism. The authors report that previous studies based on captive elephants have
generally found a similar component, but that a study on free ranging did not. The discussion
explains that although it might seem that working elephants are closer to the captive populations,
according to the authors, they are not. One important aspect that might be add to the discussion
is the experience of the raters. It has been previously shown that raters with contrasting
experiences can rate individuals differently (Gosling 2001). Mahout’s work-related experience
with elephants might resemble more those of people working in captive conditions, rather than
people who rate wild animals on the basis of observations and not work- or management- related
interactions. Also, if this would be re-labelled to Dominance such a discussion would not be
needed.
p 18. line 389-390. “The existence of the dominance factor in Asian elephants is not surprising as
6
in elephants dominance is related to social status.” This statement is not completely clear, the
terms dominance and social status are sometimes used interchangeably in the literature so it
might be useful to be more specific here.
p 20. The authors discussed that there was no difference between captive-born and wild-born
individuals in personality scores. Could this result be also connected to selective capture (some
individuals do not get caught), and also selective mortality in captive conditions? E.g. some
personality types are harder to catch from the wild population and at the same time not desirable
to have in captive conditions (e.g. highly aggressive ones).

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper on elephant personalities by Seltmann et al.
The authors' work on elephants in Myanmar is well-known, and I was excited to review this
paper. Although I think it warrants publication in RSOS, I think this paper requires substantial
review and rewrite before it can be considered for such. I am particularly concerned with the
personality factors on which the authors focused. Royal Society Open Science is a journal that will
be read by many scientists and non-scientists outside the authors' field. In addition, personality
research is not a widely understood field so although the Intro and Discussion sections provide
some treatment of the field, specific explanations of how these factors were originally described
for animals and why they are relevant for elephants specifically are needed. Personally, I do not
believe these factors account satisfactorily for the variability in individual elephant behavior,
7
especially in wild elephants. Although the authors are experts in the field of life history analysis,
they are not experts on elephant behaviour. I would encourage the authors to show a draft of this
ms to such an expert for input; this would have been more beneficial before the study was
conducted, but I still think such input would be useful now as well. In summary, although I think
this study has merit, I would like to see the authors spent significantly more time explaining why
they chose the measures/factors they did and how these measures sufficiently explain individual
differences in elephant personalities. The authors also fail to discuss any limitations arising from
asking mahouts to judge their own elephants. I’m sure there are some.
Some points:
The title needs to be more descriptive; it’s too vague now.
The first two sentences of the abstract are cumbersome; consider rewording.
Line 50: our ability TO make generalisations..
Line 70: drop the e.g.
Line 72: drop however
Line 103-104: drop exceptionally sound, that’s a bit much.
Line 113-114: “…the validity of these results…is questionable. “ This is poorly worded. Are the
validity of the results questionable because one population is captive and one is “semi-captive”?
Line 114: How was the wild study with African elephants conducted; this requires a bit more
explanation. Who filled out the questionnaires, or was this a strictly behavioral study?
Lines 119 – 124: The authors need to proofread this manuscript. There are a lot of redundancies
and grammatical errors. You say you studied the relationship between personality, elephant age,
sex and origin and then say a sentence later that you anticipated finding a relationship. Combine
these sentences or differentiate clearly between your hypotheses and predictions.
Lines 126-140: Why is this the end of the Introduction? Shouldn’t this be the end of the
Discussion?
Line 145: Roughly 2000 – 5000. The range has to be substantially smaller than this; I understand
that no one knows how many wild Myanmar elephants there really are, but this range is too wide
to be informative. If you can't change this, explain why the range is so large.
Line 147-148: I don’t see how you can say the demographics of Myanmar timber elephants
resemble those of wild elephants if you have very little data on wild elephant population
numbers. Please clarify.
Line 171: Provide median measures as well; the mean age of the raters is obviously skewed by the
newest mahouts.
Results: I am a bit apprehensive about the delineation of personality factors. If these factors are
consistent across studies, as the authors state, this needs to be fleshed out more. The readers’
main exposure to these terms is in the Results section, and the reason for these factors’ labels
(either in their use in this paper or historically) needs to be addressed in more detail. I appreciate
that the Discussion section discusses each factor already, but I’d like to see the authors explain
8
why these factors are used and their relevance to understanding individual differences across
elephants. This needs a lot more attention from the authors.
I think the mahouts’ personalities, behavior and experiences need considerable attention in this
manuscript. Although there are some simple demographics listed, why not address the impact of
individual differences in mahouts in their assessment of individual elephant personalities? As the
authors discuss the use of common factors across non-human primate species, they should also
address what’s so unique about Myanmar timber elephants: the extensive, long-term relationship
between mahouts and elephants. Did the authors look at differences in responses between
mahouts, for example, across each personality factor? This would have been an interesting
analysis. I understand this ms focuses on elephants and not mahouts, but more attention to the
latter would be very interesting. It also supports the fact that the authors' study population in
Myanmar is probably one of the best in the world for studying elephant personalities given the
large sample size, the detail of the historical data available to the authors, and the long-standing
relationship between mahouts and their elephants there.

On the whole, all of the reviewers found the data sound and the sample size impressive.
However, the reviewers had converging concerns with the manuscript. Specifically, two
reviewers had similar concerns with the low inter-rater reliability of many items in the sample;
the misleading statement of the sample size in the abstract; and the treatment of the existing
literature in this field. All three reviewers were concerned with the accuracy of the terminology
used and the labelling of traits. Reviewer 1 is also concerned that the questionnaire data were not
supported by behavioural data; reviewer 3 had similar concerns, though motivated from an
alternative perspective. I do not wish to list their comments in detail here, but I find myself in
agreement with the reviewers regarding both the manuscript’s strengths and its potential
shortcomings. As highlighted by all the reviewers, much preliminary work needs to be done to
make a robust questionnaire for this kind of study; this could be addressed in a reanalysis and re-
interpretation of these data in line with the reviewers' comments.
Some additional comments:
L54: it might be worth mentioning that the behavioural measurements can occur under both
natural and test (e.g. novel object, open field, etc.) conditions.
LL54-57: this statement depends on which literature is searched. There is a vast literature on trait
ratings in differential and comparative psychology.
LL170-171, 195-196, 210-211: these data are not normally distributed. Please state the median and
interquartile range (rather than the mean and standard error).
LL71-72: I agree with reviewer 1 that this is an oversimplification; there is a vast literature on dog
personality by ratings, for example, as well as many other species. See Gosling 2001 “From mice
to men - what can we learn about personality from animal research” for a now-outdated review
of this literature.
L179: I’m not sure what is meant by “experimental” here. No variable was manipulated, so this
term may be misleading without further elaboration. Perhaps remove this term from here.
L326: the conclusion that complex social interactions result from multitiered societies does not
follow (e.g. geladas show a similarly multitiered social structure, but males seem unable to
differentiate the vocalisations of familiar and unfamiliar individuals outside their unit). I would
recommend removing the term “therefore”.
LL328-331: Perhaps a good comparison (/prediction) would be a non-social species that lacks an
Agreeableness factor.
Minor style points:
L25: data was -> data were
L57: case on research -> case of research
L66: insert comma between “boldness activity”
L93: predicting -> predictive
L137: data is -> data are
L139: cetacean -> cetaceans
L150: exists -> exist
L152: ; sex -> ; and sex
L193: Avoid starting a sentence with a numeral
10
L199, 328: Interestingly -> Interestingly,
L326: multitier -> multitiered
L327: over lifetime -> over their lifetime
L418: insert a space after the period
Figures 1 & 2: The panels could be stacked vertically and the x-axis labelled only once to make
these figure less busy and more easily interpretable.

issues.
Table 2 would benefit from reordering the items on the basis of the loading values salient to each
component.
Discussion:
p 17. Neuroticism. The authors report that previous studies based on captive elephants have
generally found a similar component, but that a study on free ranging did not. The discussion
explains that although it might seem that working elephants are closer to the captive populations,
according to the authors, they are not. One important aspect that might be add to the discussion
is the experience of the raters. It has been previously shown that raters with contrasting
experiences can rate individuals differently (Gosling 2001). Mahout’s work-related experience
with elephants might resemble more those of people working in captive conditions, rather than
people who rate wild animals on the basis of observations and not work- or management- related
interactions. Also, if this would be re-labelled to Dominance such a discussion would not be
needed.
p 18. line 389-390. “The existence of the dominance factor in Asian elephants is not surprising as
in elephants dominance is related to social status.” This statement is not completely clear, the
terms dominance and social status are sometimes used interchangeably in the literature so it
might be useful to be more specific here.
p 20. The authors discussed that there was no difference between captive-born and wild-born
individuals in personality scores. Could this result be also connected to selective capture (some
individuals do not get caught), and also selective mortality in captive conditions? E.g. some
personality types are harder to catch from the wild population and at the same time not desirable
to have in captive conditions (e.g. highly aggressive ones).

Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper on elephant personalities by Seltmann et al.
The authors' work on elephants in Myanmar is well-known, and I was excited to review this
paper. Although I think it warrants publication in RSOS, I think this paper requires substantial
review and rewrite before it can be considered for such. I am particularly concerned with the
personality factors on which the authors focused. Royal Society Open Science is a journal that will
be read by many scientists and non-scientists outside the authors' field. In addition, personality
research is not a widely understood field so although the Intro and Discussion sections provide
some treatment of the field, specific explanations of how these factors were originally described
for animals and why they are relevant for elephants specifically are needed. Personally, I do not
believe these factors account satisfactorily for the variability in individual elephant behavior,
especially in wild elephants. Although the authors are experts in the field of life history analysis,
they are not experts on elephant behaviour. I would encourage the authors to show a draft of this
ms to such an expert for input; this would have been more beneficial before the study was
conducted, but I still think such input would be useful now as well. In summary, although I think
this study has merit, I would like to see the authors spent significantly more time explaining why
they chose the measures/factors they did and how these measures sufficiently explain individual
differences in elephant personalities. The authors also fail to discuss any limitations arising from
asking mahouts to judge their own elephants. I’m sure there are some.
Some points:
The title needs to be more descriptive; it’s too vague now.
The first two sentences of the abstract are cumbersome; consider rewording.
Line 50: our ability TO make generalisations..
Line 70: drop the e.g.
Line 72: drop however
Line 103-104: drop exceptionally sound, that’s a bit much.
Line 113-114: “…the validity of these results…is questionable. “ This is poorly worded. Are the
validity of the results questionable because one population is captive and one is “semi-captive”?
Line 114: How was the wild study with African elephants conducted; this requires a bit more
explanation. Who filled out the questionnaires, or was this a strictly behavioral study?
Lines 119 – 124: The authors need to proofread this manuscript. There are a lot of redundancies
and grammatical errors. You say you studied the relationship between personality, elephant age,
sex and origin and then say a sentence later that you anticipated finding a relationship. Combine
these sentences or differentiate clearly between your hypotheses and predictions.
Lines 126-140: Why is this the end of the Introduction? Shouldn’t this be the end of the
Discussion?
Line 145: Roughly 2000 – 5000. The range has to be substantially smaller than this; I understand
that no one knows how many wild Myanmar elephants there really are, but this range is too wide
to be informative. If you can't change this, explain why the range is so large.
15
Line 147-148: I don’t see how you can say the demographics of Myanmar timber elephants
resemble those of wild elephants if you have very little data on wild elephant population
numbers. Please clarify.
Line 171: Provide median measures as well; the mean age of the raters is obviously skewed by the
newest mahouts.
Results: I am a bit apprehensive about the delineation of personality factors. If these factors are
consistent across studies, as the authors state, this needs to be fleshed out more. The readers’
main exposure to these terms is in the Results section, and the reason for these factors’ labels
(either in their use in this paper or historically) needs to be addressed in more detail. I appreciate
that the Discussion section discusses each factor already, but I’d like to see the authors explain
why these factors are used and their relevance to understanding individual differences across
elephants. This needs a lot more attention from the authors.
I think the mahouts’ personalities, behavior and experiences need considerable attention in this
manuscript. Although there are some simple demographics listed, why not address the impact of
individual differences in mahouts in their assessment of individual elephant personalities? As the
authors discuss the use of common factors across non-human primate species, they should also
address what’s so unique about Myanmar timber elephants: the extensive, long-term relationship
between mahouts and elephants. Did the authors look at differences in responses between
mahouts, for example, across each personality factor? This would have been an interesting
analysis. I understand this ms focuses on elephants and not mahouts, but more attention to the
latter would be very interesting. It also supports the fact that the authors' study population in
Myanmar is probably one of the best in the world for studying elephant personalities given the
large sample size, the detail of the historical data available to the authors, and the long-standing
relationship between mahouts and their elephants there.

Review of Personality in semi-captive Asian elephants, submitted to Royal Society Open Science.
– revised ms
The ms has much improved in the description of the theoretical and methodical background of
the study, and of why studying elephants is important and interesting.
But basic empirical problems persist. The interrater agreement is far too low to consider these
data as reliable. It may well be that semi-captive elephants are very complex and behave very
differently towards different humans who then get very different impression of them – but this
challenges the idea elephants have consistent behavioural tendencies commonly called
personality. But it may also be that the personality constructs used are just not applicable to
elephants and to the Malaysian persons asked to assess them. There may also have been cultural
and language differences – ultimately, the authors come from Western societies, which are very
different from the raters’ societies. The authors themselves report that adjectives like gentle and
sensitive made no sense to the mahouts. This may also have been the case with the other items
but raters may not have fed this information back to the researchers who have obviously invested
a lot in getting data about several hundred elephants.
Why did the authors use now Fleiss’ kappa as reliability measure – it is a measure for categorial
data, not for ordinal that are used here? This unusual selection raises questions. Maybe the
reliability scores of the ordinal reliability measures were even lower? Kappa scores should be 0.60
and higher to be meaningful; the authors report “The values for Fleiss’ kappa ranged from 0.09
(playful) to 0.326 (moody) with a mean of 0.184. Of our 28 items, 10 showed fair agreement (>
0.20) and 18 showed slight agreement (> 0.01) ([47]).”
From a psychometric point of view, these extremely low interrater agreement problem constitute
a very serious problem that compromises all analyses presented. Given the extremely low
reliabilities, the factorial structures reported could simply reflect semiotic patterns – therefore
they are making sense to us. But they may have only little to do with the elephant individuals in
the focus of this study.
This unreliable data base may also explain the difficulties to find a model fit of these data for the
elephant personality structure presented in Yasui et al. 2013.
I understand the authors have invested a great deal of effort in this study, but if personality
ratings do not provide reliable data, then they should not and cannot be used in science.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
The revised manuscript has now received two reviews, including one from one of the original
reviewers. Before summarising the reviewers’ concerns, I would take this opportunity to thank
the authors for their detailed and considered revisions of their manuscript, and again commend
the large sample, thorough analyses, and nuanced interpretations. However, both reviewers have
a similar criticism regarding the lack of behavioural or other data to confirm the identified
personality factors and the low IRRs. Although I agree with the reviewers that other data would
be a great addition to this study, I do not believe that this criticism makes the manuscript
scientifically unsound in its current form, particularly given the study’s strengths listed above
and the authors' response to these criticisms in the first round of revisions. I do, however, agree
with the reviewers’ concerns about the underlying items used in the questionnaire—if one goal is
to compare personality dimensions in elephants to humans and other long-lived social primates
(LL91-92, 295-296), then comparable questionnaires should be used. To better address this, could
19
the authors please add how many items were taken from each of the elephant and primate
questionnaires at LL158-160 so that the reader can make this comparison?
A very few minor points:
L53: humans can be rated by others, too. Perhaps add “including” before “self-assessment” here.
LL58-59: just a small point: behavioural coding can be limited by multiple factors, including
missing rare but important events for assessing personality that observers catch when spending
time with the study animals (e.g. responses to attempted predation events, etc.). I would suggest
that the authors could be a little less cautious in their wording here; at the very least, I don’t think
this method has to be presented as a second-rate alternative to behavioural coding if that method
is not able to be done.
L67: socialness -> sociability
L90: remove the open bracket: (
LL113-117: please use past tense.
LL204-207: inverted commas are the wrong way around on either side of the words.
L342: space required between period and “To”
LL368-379: the following article may be useful for interpreting this result:
https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017146
Subject Editor Comments to the Author:
I thank the reviewers for trenchant and instructive comments. It is a particularly good insight that
it is difficult not to anthropomorphize descriptive terms, as the authors acknowledge, and that
mahouts may have different qualities to assess in their animals than behavioral scientists may
have. With that said, I think that the authors can qualify some of their discussion to include these
and other considerations. Whereas we must admit that the conditions of animal behavior studies
can seldom be perfect, we also acknowledge that using the best methods possible can still
provide acceptable if not uncontroversial results. I support the "r/r" decision mainly to give the
authors more time than for a "revise" decision, and thank the reviewers once again for their
efforts.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Alecia Carter):
I again thank the authors for their considered and thorough revisions of this manuscript. My
previous praises of the study stand, so I will not reiterate them here. However, given the
continued concern of reviewer 1 in the previous round of revisions, I encourage the authors to
address briefly but explicitly the relatively low IRRs of the items in their initial presentation of
them, and the justification for continuing with them in the subsequent analyses. E.g. at L252, the
authors could add a sentence or two similar to their response to the reviewer, along the lines of
"although these scores are arguably low, they are in line with other published studies [examples]
and we have chosen to include all of them in our subsequent analyses". Please be explicit as to
why the authors have made this decision here so the reader is aware that this is not as
straightforward as it currently seems. In addition, at LL478-479, it may be better to be more
cautious here given the low IRRs of the items--remove the term "reliably" as this reliability was
only "slight" to "fair" (LL250-252) and the current wording is not representative of the ambiguity
in these data.

On the whole, all of the reviewers found the data sound and the sample size impressive. However, the
reviewers had converging concerns with the manuscript. Specifically, two reviewers had similar concerns
with the low inter-rater reliability of many items in the sample; the misleading statement of the sample
size in the abstract; and the treatment of the existing literature in this field. All three reviewers were
concerned with the accuracy of the terminology used and the labelling of traits. Reviewer 1 is also
concerned that the questionnaire data were not supported by behavioural data; reviewer 3 had similar
concerns, though motivated from an alternative perspective. I do not wish to list their comments in
detail here, but I find myself in agreement with the reviewers regarding both the manuscript’s strengths
and its potential shortcomings. As highlighted by all the reviewers, much preliminary work needs to be
done to make a robust questionnaire for this kind of study; this could be addressed in a reanalysis and
re-interpretation of these data in line with the reviewers' comments.
A: We have now revised our manuscript according to your and the reviewers’ comments as outlined
below. Specifically, we have now improved and augmented our analyses to be more appropriate for our
data, the terminology and labelling of traits and addressed concerns about questionnaire data not being
supported by behavioural data. Furthermore, we contacted two leading experts on behaviour of African
and Asian elephants to provide help with the interpretation of our previous results. Unfortunately only
one person had time to provide feedback in time before the resubmission deadline. We would like to
point out though that one of the co-authors (Khyne U Mar) has 50 years of experience working with
elephants. We now start with a confirmatory factor analysis in which we compare the fit of our data to a
previously published 5-factor model of elephant personality. We have revised the manuscript from all
parts and hope that overall, this has improved the manuscript along the lines you and all referees had in
mind.
Some additional comments:
L54: it might be worth mentioning that the behavioural measurements can occur under both natural and
test (e.g. novel object, open field, etc.) conditions.
A: We agree and added this information to the sentence, ll. 50-51.
LL54-57: this statement depends on which literature is searched. There is a vast literature on trait
ratings in differential and comparative psychology.
A: We agree with the editor on the extent of literature on trait ratings in differential and comparative
psychology; however, in his review, Gosling (2001) found that 74% of animal personality studies were
conducted using behavioural coding and only 34% had employed trait ratings (8% used both methods).
For a more recent review on personality research methods in primates and the bias towards behavioural
coding see also Fig2.1 in Freeman et al. 2011 Comparison of Methods for Assessing Personality in
Nonhuman Primates. In: Weiss A., King J., Murray L. (eds) Personality and Temperament in Nonhuman
Primates. Developments in Primatology: Progress and Prospects. Springer, New York, NY. Therefore, we
decided to retain our statement that behavioural coding is dominating research on animal personalities
and now provide the reader with the above information, l. 51.
LL170-171, 195-196, 210-211: these data are not normally distributed. Please state the median and
interquartile range (rather than the mean and standard error).
A: This is a good remark; instead of means and SDs we now provide the median and the interquartile
range, ll. 147-152 (see also comment 13 from reviewer 3).
LL71-72: I agree with reviewer 1 that this is an oversimplification; there is a vast literature on dog
personality by ratings, for example, as well as many other species. See Gosling 2001 “From mice to men
- what can we learn about personality from animal research” for a now-outdated review of this
literature.
A: We apologize for not considering the previous literature on e.g. dogs, horses, hyenas and elephants
here. We modified the sentence and added more references, l. 72.
L179: I’m not sure what is meant by “experimental” here. No variable was manipulated, so this term
may be misleading without further elaboration. Perhaps remove this term from here.
A: We agree and replaced “experimental” with “behavioural”, l. 160.
L326: the conclusion that complex social interactions result from multitiered societies does not follow
(e.g. geladas show a similarly multitiered social structure, but males seem unable to differentiate the
vocalisations of familiar and unfamiliar individuals outside their unit). I would recommend removing the
term “therefore”.
A: We agree and follow heed to the editor’s suggestion and deleted the term “therefore”, l. 339.
LL328-331: Perhaps a good comparison (/prediction) would be a non-social species that lacks an
Agreeableness factor.
A: We thank the associate editor for this excellent point. We added a sentence about this to the
corresponding paragraph, ll. 342-345.
Minor style points:
L25: data was -> data were
A: Corrected as suggested, l. 21.
L57: case on research -> case of research
A: Corrected as suggested, l. 53.
L66: insert comma between “boldness activity”

L150: exists -> exist
A: This sentence has been modified.
L152: ; sex -> ; and sex
A: Corrected as suggested, l. 132.
L193: Avoid starting a sentence with a numeral
A: The sentence now starts with “Of the 257 elephants …”, l. 176.
L199, 328: Interestingly -> Interestingly,
A: Corrected as suggested, l. 341 (first “interestingly” has been removed).
L326: multitier -> multitiered
A: Corrected as suggested, l. 338.
L327: over lifetime -> over their lifetime
A: Corrected as suggested, l. 339.
L418: insert a space after the period
A: This sentence has been removed.
Figures 1 & 2: The panels could be stacked vertically and the x-axis labelled only once to make these

Review of Personality in semi-captive Asian elephants, submitted to Royal Society Open Science.
The ms presents an interesting study on a species not yet much studied for individual differences. The
sample is quite large, but the methods are weak. Only questionnaires were used, inter-rater agreement
is absent for more than a third of the scales used and no behavioural data are provided to validate the
findings. Moreover, the theoretical background is not well researched and linked to the present study.
I provide my comments in chronological order.
A: We thank you for your detailed review. We have now changed our analysis to fit better to our data,
extended the cited literature, responded to your concerns about low ICCs and behavioural ratings and
questionnaires, and addressed all of your other comments here or in the manuscript itself (see
comments in detail below). We hope you find our manuscript improved.
Abstract
Why are long-lived, highly-social wild mammals with high cognitive abilities interesting and worthwhile
being studied for personality differences, what can we learn from this? This should be elaborated and
explained to the reader.
A: We do not think that this is explicitly necessary in the abstract also with regard to the word limit. We
state that data on personality of long-lived highly social mammals (though existing) is not abundant and
therefore it is important to increase our sample to be able to compare personality between different
long-lived, highly-social wild mammals. This is important because studies bridging human personality to
that of other highly social, long-lived species are mostly restricted to a single taxa (primates) or occur
only in captive settings and with smaller sample sizes. The methods to describe personality in human
and non-human studies also largely differ, hindering our ability to make generalisations concerning how
the findings on humans may generalise to other long-lived social species beyond primates. Comparative
studies on the personality of a multitude of other long-lived social species with similar and different life-
histories and environments allow us to ultimately research the origins of personality. We believe that we
address the issue comprehensively in the introduction.
In the abstract, the description of the methods and data collected is not clear at all.
A: We slightly reworded the abstract, give now more information on the methods used and hope it is
clearer to understand, ll. 19-33.
What are “behavioural traits” and how were they scored – or did you mean rating items?
A: We changed this sentence to “Data were collected during 2014 to 2017 using questionnaires, for
which elephant riders (mahouts) rated 28 behavioural adjectives.” and we hope it is more clear now, ll.
21-23.
What means the statement that “multiple questionnaires” were used, did you use different ones or just
asked multiple raters per elephant to complete the same questionnaire?
A: We apologize for the ambiguous expression and rephrased the sentence to “Repeated questionnaires
were obtained for each elephant from several raters whenever possible, resulting in 690 ratings of 150
female and 107 male elephants” (ll. 23-24). The same questionnaire was conducted repeatedly for the
same individual elephant by the elephant’s own mahout or the head mahout, sometimes repeatedly
between years.
How did you count the total of 496 ratings, are these single scores or numbers of questionnaires
completed?
A: There were 496 questionnaires conducted during 2013 to 2015. They include multiple scores on
individual elephants. These numbers have changed however in our revised version of the manuscript, as
we changed our analyses and incorporated newly available data from 2016 to 2017, please see ll. 174-
180.
Why are 221 elephants reported here when the data eventually reflect just those of 158? This is still a
very large sample. Drop out in field studies is always high but reporting should be accurate and not
mislead readers to assume the sample be 50% larger.
A: We sincerely apologize for this mistake and agree that the final sample size of 158 should have been
mentioned already in the abstract. For the ICC analyses we used the total sample size of 221, since
missing values were included in the ICC estimation and that is why we mentioned the sample size of 221
in the abstract. The sample size now however has changed (257 elephants, 690 questionnaires) due to
our re-analyses and due to the use of different sample years (2014 to 2017). We excluded ratings from
2013 as the mean and the variance of each trait rated were different to the other years.
How can you conclude that elephants “expressed five personality factors”? The ratings capture what the
raters think about the elephants studied but not about how the elephants have actually behaved.
Countless attribution biases are known to occur in ratings of human and animal individuals. Moreover,
factors are statistical constructs, nothing that could be found in nature.
A: We agree that the sentence “Elephants expressed five personality factors, which were named
Agreeableness, Seriousness, Neuroticism, Curiosity and Dominance.” was poorly worded. We therefore
reworded the sentence to “This model suggested that personality in these elephants was manifested as
three factors that we labelled as Attentiveness, Sociability, and Aggressiveness.” (ll. 28-30)
Furthermore, the reviewers addresses two different points here: (1) that there can be substantial bias in
trait ratings by human raters when rating traits/items in human and non-human personality
questionnaire assessments and (2) that factors or latent variables originating from factor analysis are
mere statistical constructs. Considering point (1) we tend to agree with the reviewer that there can be
rating biases when raters have strong opinions or preconceptions about the individual and/or behaviour
that is rated. However, these biases can and should be minimised by carefully constructed items and
questions and using descriptions that are clear and relevant to the context and species investigated (e.g.
Gosling 2001 Psychol. Bull. 127, 45–86) and we now address these issue in ll. 62-64. Regarding point
(2) we tend to disagree with the reviewer. Factors derived by (exploratory) factor analysis are indeed
statistical constructs, however factors or latent variables account for variation and covariation between
several observed variables (see e.g. Brown 2015 Confirmatory Factor Analysis for Applied Research, The
Guilford Press). While latent variables can indeed not be measured directly in nature, it does not mean
that those cannot be found in nature as the reviewer suggests. One simple example might be “Health”
as a factor; one might not be able to measure health directly, but via certain underlying traits like
cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc. Just because health cannot be measured directly, nobody would
doubt that health does not exist in nature and is just a statistical artefact.
l. 63
The idea that behavioural ratings “can serve as an integrated measurement of individual behaviour over
a longer time period [8] and allow to collect a whole set of different behaviours instead of only one or
two items of interest” devalues the efforts of behavioural researchers needed to study how animals
really behave. Importantly, it ignores the well-known and profound memory biases of humans as well
social constructions of ideas about animal behaviour. How many myths about animal behaviour were
shown to be not true? This could be unravelled only with through behavioural research, not with simple
personality questionnaires.
A: We disagree that this sentence or the idea that it conveys “devalues” data collection by observations
done in the field and we did not want to imply that. The co-authors of our manuscript do field work on a
regular basis in different environments and on different species. We are well aware of the difficulties and
efforts that are involved with field work. Nonetheless we believe that in situations where behavioural
coding is extremely difficult or simply not possible, collecting behavioural ratings is a fruitful alternative
that, when experienced raters are asked, they can serve as an integrated measurement of individual
behaviour over a longer time period (Vazire et al. 2007 Measuring personality in nonhuman animals.
In:Handbook of Research Methods in Personality Psychology (Robins RW, Fraley RC, Krueger R, eds) pp.
190-208. New York: Guilford). We agree that correlational studies of behavioural observations and trait
ratings are desirable and we indeed started collecting behavioural observations of our elephants that in
future studies could be related to our trait ratings. Furthermore, several studies have looked at the
correlation of behavioural coding and trait ratings and found strong correlations (e.g. Konecna et al.
2008 J Comp Psychol 122, 379–389; Weiss et al. 2011 J Comp Psychol 125, 72–83; Carter et al. 2012
Behav Ecol Sociobiol 66, 153–160). See also Gosling & John 1999 Curr Dir Psychol Sci 8, 69-75, in which
the authors argue against the concern of anthropomorphism of human ratings of animals. We address
the potential pitfall of cognitive bias in the revised manuscript (see also the previous comment) in lines
62-64. Finally we want to note that behavioural coding or observations are not always free of
measurement error (e.g. Vazire et al. 2007. Measuring personality in nonhuman animals. In:Handbook
of Research Methods in Personality Psychology (Robins RW, Fraley RC, Krueger R, eds) pp. 190-208.
New York: Guilford) and questionnaires are by no means simple.
l. 72
The literature is not well researched. There are numerous species other than primates who were studied
with personality questionnaires, not only dolphins. There are also studies on elephant personality (e.g.,
by Phyllis Lee in 2012) not cited here.
A: This is a good point and we have to apologize for not considering the previous literature on e.g. dogs,
horses, hyenas and elephants here. We have now added more references, l. 72.
l. 102
Why does the semi-captive population of working elephants provide a sound basis for looking at
individual differences in a long-lived species? In what ways can findings from these elephants be
generalised to wild and other captive elephants? What justifies the assumption that elephants forced to
work all day can express their natural behaviours to a large extend? Sure, their environments may be
more natural than those of zoo elephants but the latter are not forced to work all day. The
argumentation about the sample is not very convincing and some claims made are not well justified.
A: We agree that there are naturally clear differences in the semi-captive population compared to wild
elephants; however there are also many reasons why they are likely to show natural Asian elephant
behaviour and personality (in addition to reasoning in lines 136-138). Their observed mortality rates are
close to wild elephants (Clubb et al. 2008) and also calf mortality is much lower than in zoo populations
(Mar et al. 2012). Calves are allowed to stay with their mothers and allo-mothers the first years of life
(Lahdenperä et al. 2015), which is comparable to natural behaviour in wild and early environment,
forming the basis for natural cognitive and behavioural development (including personality: e.g. Stamps
& Groothuis 2010 Phil Trans R Soc 365, 4029–4041) in elephants (Bradshaw et al. 2005 Nature
433:807). Also relatives, which are important, are often nearby and have important effects on calf
development, survival and female reproductive success (Lahdenperä et al. 2016). In addition to the
environment and management of this semi-captive population, the animals represent a unique sample
for studying personality in long-lived Asian elephants, for which this big sample size as well as age range
is very rare and only available from zoo settings so far.
l. 197
Why were there so many missing ratings? This could be an indicator that the raters have not fully
understood the items or found them not applicable to the elephants? The findings that raters with
incomplete questionnaires were mostly younger and less experienced speaks for this idea.
A: This is a good point and it seems plausible that younger and less experienced mahouts did not
understand the questionnaire. We looked at ICCs when we excluded less experienced mahouts from our
previous dataset (2013 to 2015) (less than 1 year of experience, less than 2 years of experience and
less than 3 years of experience). Indeed, the mean ICC values for ICC (3,1) and ICC (3,k) increased
from 0.20 and 0.34 to 0.25 and 0.40 (when mahouts with less than 1 year of experience excluded), to
0.23 and 0.36 (when mahouts with less than 2 years of experience excluded) and to 0.24 and 0.35
(when mahouts with less than 3 years of experience excluded). There is an initial increase in ICCs when
the least experienced mahouts are excluded, however the ICC values seem to stabilize around 0.23 and
0.35 when excluding mahouts with less than 2 or 3 years of experience. Therefore we do not think that
young age or inexperience are satisfying explanations for the missing ratings. In our new analyses we do
include missing ratings, since full information maximum likelihood estimation provides reliable estimates
when including missing values in the data.
L. 238
Interrater reliability analysis is a means to test, if the raters agreed sufficiently well in their assessments
of the individuals under study. It is a quality criterion and therefore has to exceed a certain value. 12
out of 31 items did not even exceed ICC (3,k) > .30, many of them almost zero. Thus, these items
failed the quality criterion needed for questionnaire data to be meaningful at all. That is, most items
used had clearly insufficient reliability scores, the raters did not agree at all in how they assessed the
individuals. This entails that all subsequent analyses are based on unreliable data, which compromises
the reliability and validity of all further findings reported. This data set clearly does not meet the high-
quality criteria of a journal like Royal Society Open Science.
A: The reviewer is right that interrater reliability analysis is used to investigate if raters agree sufficiently
on an item. To some extent we do agree that those values are relatively low for the purpose of
estimating reliability of a variable in general. But this could be a critique to the whole field of personality
assessment by questionnaires and is out of the scope of our response to the reviewer nor is it in the
scope of our manuscript. It might be an interesting endeavour to look into the general credibility of
those studies. For now however, we can say that the range of our ICCs (mean ICC (3,1) = 0.20, mean
ICC (3,k) = 0.34) are completely acceptable in the field of psychology (e.g. Grogan et al. 2008 Appl
Anim Behav Sci 113, 206–214: mean ICC (3,1) = 0.35, mean ICC (3,k) = 0.54; Weiss et al. 2011 J
Comp Psycol 125, 72–83: mean ICC (3,1) = 0.26, mean ICC (3,k) = 0.52; Konecna et al. 2008 J Comp
Psycol 122, 379-389: mean ICC (3,1) = 0.31, mean ICC (3,k) = 0.58; Lee & Moss 2012 J Comp Psycol
126, 224-232: range ICC (3,k) = 0.02 to 0.72) and is nothing out of the ordinary. The translation of the
questionnaire from English to Myanmar might be accompanied with information loss and some of the
items might be difficult for the mahouts to understand (that’s why we exclude the items “sensitive” and
“gentle” before starting any analyses, as mahouts seemed to have trouble to answer those two
questions). The reviewer’s criticism made us think though and using ICCs was indeed not appropriate for
our data since the estimation of ICCs assumes continuous data (which would be given when using a 1 -7
point Likert scale). Since our scale only ranges from 1 to 4, we decided to use another, more appropriate
measure of interrater reliability, namely Fleiss’ Kappa for categorical ordinal data. Furthermore we now
use the sums and not the means of the ratings for factor analysis since the summed ratings showed a
distribution closer to the assumptions of robust maximum likelihood estimation used by exploratory and
confirmatory factor analysis than the distribution of the mean items.
In ICC(3,k), the number of raters k included in these analyses should be indicated in the results section
and the table.
A: The k was provided in the methods section when explaining how often each elephant was rated on
average (2.2 times). Therefore the number of k raters was 2.2. We agree that this information could
have been added to table 1. This became obsolete since we do not use ICC anymore. The number of
times an elephant was rated on average (2.7) is however still provided in the methods section, l. 180.
Why were the data from different years lumped together? Personality changes, maybe that’s why no
sufficient reliability could be achieved.
A: Personality does change with age, especially in juvenile individuals; however, over a very long time
course personality (in humans) is more or less stable (McCrae, R. R. & Costa, P. T. J. 2006 Personality in
adulthood: a five-factor theory perspective. 2nd editio. New York: The Guilford Press). Our original
dataset comprised three years of data of a long-lived mammal and we like to argue that even though
age-dependent changes would be present they would not affect individual personality in such a short
time of three years. Furthermore, it was a matter of sample size. Factor analysis demands relatively
high sample sizes and splitting up our data into separate years would make factor analysis not feasible.
Why were in the items adjective and behavioural ratings lumped together? it’s been shown that both are
rated very differently and do not always agree well. Maybe this added to the extremely low and even
absent inter-rater reliability in more than a third of the items.
A: We are thankful for this very thoughtful comment and we agree with the reviewer that adjectives and
behaviours should not be used together when explaining items and that items should focus on one
point/behaviour. These issues might well have contributed to low inter-rater agreement. Unfortunately
we cannot change the questionnaire retrospectively and three years of data had already been collected
with this questionnaire.
l. 257 How could a construct “seriousness” be meaningful for animals? I don’t think that such terms are
useful in animal research and the items to which it relates empirically in this unreliable data set are not
well interrelated theoretically.
A: We agree that “Seriousness” was perhaps not a very well suited label for this factor. In our re-
analysis we find however a similar factor for both males and females. This factor includes the high
loading items Attentive, Obedient, Slow, Vigilant, Confident and Active. Considering the explanations of
those items in our questionnaire and that fact that these item share covariance, the factor structure
makes theoretical sense. Individuals that listen closely what mahouts say express as well vigilant
behaviour, they listen well to commands with little resistance and make quick decisions. One could
argue about the connection between “Slow” and “Active” as they sound contradictory at first; however,
individuals can walk around a lot and vocalise and still move around in a relaxed manner. For the
purpose of labelling factors we now simply use the item that loads strongest on the factor. We disagree
that our data is unreliable. We reported all the ICC values for all items (however now Fleiss’ kappa) and
to some extent we do agree that those values are low for the purpose of estimating reliability of a
variable in general. However similar values are frequently reported from field studies on animal
personality. See also our answer to the comment on low ICCs above.
In ll. 333 seriousness is explained as reflecting the “attitude or state of the individual”. Attitudes and
states are two VERY different concepts. Moreover, asking people to rate elephants on personality
questionnaires is not a measurement of the elephants’ attitudes to work.
A: As stated already above, “Seriousness” was perhaps not a very good label for this factor. And we
agree that we should not have (accidentally) implied that “state” and “attitude” are the same thing. We
also changed “attitude to work” to the more specific expression “response of the elephant towards
commands from mahouts”, l. 325. We do think that the reaction of an individual elephant towards its
own mahout’s commands can be assessed by questionnaires, since it is the mahouts that know how
their elephants react to different commands and situations and it’s likely these reactions are connected
to the elephant personality.
l., 335
“Seriousness resembles conscientiousness from human personality literature, which reflects rationality
and competence”. This is a misrepresentation of the human literature. In what ways are the items “slow,
obedient or inventive”, to which this construct refers in the present study (see ll. 266) related to
conscientiousness?
A: We agree that our sentence was not very clear with what we wanted to express. We wanted to state
that seriousness in elephants could among other things entail similar information as conscientiousness in
humans, how well elephants respond to mahouts (“work competence”) on the one side and how rational,
informed and organized (“work efficiency”) humans are on the other side. We agree that other items in
the previous Seriousness factor like slow and obedient do not compare well with Conscientiousness. In
our revised version we do however refrain from too many comparisons between humans and elephants
since we were advised by experts in the field of elephant behaviour not to do so.
l. 338 here finally some papers on personality in elephants are mentioned, this belongs to a proper
literature review in the introduction, especially given that this field is still quite small.
A: Again, we apologize for not having considered the previous literature enough and we have now
included more references in the introduction (including this elephant study), l. 72). But as the referee
admits, the literature on personality is not too wide. Therefore and in addition we think it is appropriate
in the discussion to compare our findings to species with similar life-histories (such as longevity) and
sociability. We do not want to suggest that elephants are like humans. However, it does make a
comparison between species easier when using similar adjectives and labels (see e.g. Mehta & Gosling
2013 Personalities in a Comparative Perspective: What do human psychologists glean from animal
personality studies? In Carere & Maestripieri (eds): Animal personalities. Behavior, physiology, and
evolution. The University of Chicago Press).
Not every questionnaire study can yield meaningful results and this seems the case in the study
presented. The item selection should be systematically improved until a useful and valid questionnaire is
developed. Validity requires evidence of systematic relations to observable behaviour, at least in a
subsample. This has not been done. Moreover, the agreement between the raters is far too low and
even completely absent for more than a third of the items. The agreement evidenced here is ways below
chance levels, thus reflecting random patterns, so that all subsequent analyses are compromised and no
evidence for their reliability or validity provided. The authors mention data from several years, but
analyses of temporal consistency is not provided, which could provide some evidence for reliability. But
this has not been done either. Therefore, the findings could simply indicate some semantic relationships
between the items presented without having any relations to the elephants individuals studied. I cannot
recommend this study for publication given this insufficient data base.
A: We agree with the reviewer that questionnaires have to be constructed carefully. When constructing a
new measurement instrument it is good practice to include previously successfully used traits and
expand those with context-dependent suitable new traits and that is what we have done here. Not all
questionnaires have been validated with behavioural observations, but when this has been done, strong
correlations have been found between behavioural coding and trait ratings; furthermore, literature
shows that trait ratings are a reliable technique to assess personality differences (please see also our
previous responses). Inter-rater reliability was in the range of previously reported values. Arguing that
these values are in general too low to actually describe reliability of raters could be a critique brought
forward against the field of personality psychology, but is out of the scope of this manuscript.
Nonetheless, we hope that our responses and re-analysis now address these concerns and that we have
shown that this study can serve as a useful platform to build on and improve the sparse literature on
personality of long-lived highly social mammals.

This paper examines personality ratings in a semi-free population of Asian elephants. The paper makes a
novel and solid contribution to the growing literature on animal personality and should be of wide
interest. In general, the paper is very strong as it is based on large sample sizes, uses rigorous data
analysis and draws mostly appropriate interpretations.
A: We are thankful for the reviewer’s helpful and supportive words.
I have following comments:
Abstract: The authors state in the abstract that the study is based on 221 elephants. However, this is
not actually the case. They attempted to collect data on 221elephants but due to very good reasons
(questionnaires not filled completely) they excluded (correctly) some of the individuals from all analyses
conducted in the paper, including the personality assessment and the subsequent comparison between
sexes and ages. The remaining N=158 is still an impressive sample size. Therefore, I think it would be of
no harm to state 158 as the sample size in the abstract of the final paper.
A: Again, we sincerely apologize for this sloppy mistake (see comment 6 from reviewer 1). For the ICC
analyses we used the total sample size of 221, since missing values were included in the ICC estimation
and that is why we mentioned the sample size of 221 in the abstract. The sample size now however has
changed (257 elephants, 690 questionnaires) due to our re-analyses and due to the use of different
sample years (2014 to 2017). We excluded ratings from 2013 as the mean and the variance of each trait
rated were different compared to the other years.
Introduction and Methods: I found the framing of the methods used a little bit confusing. The two
principal methods are usually (e.g. Gosling 2001) referred to as behavioral coding (referred to as “direct
behavioral measurements of the focal individual” in current ms.) and questionnaire/trait ratings
(referred to as “behavioral ratings” in the ms.). The authors clearly used questionnaire ratings, with all
items accompanied by behavioral definitions. I know that the questionnaire approach has been criticized
in animal personality research, but the authors themselves support the use of this method using
relevant arguments and by citing appropriate literature. Also, the behavioral definition has been used in
previous questionnaire based studies. I see no need to use another term. Using the term “behavioral”
instead of the questionnaire/trait term makes it confusing (especially in the introduction and the
compared to methods).
A: We are thankful for this thoughtful comment and agree that we used confusing wording. We now
strictly refer to “behavioural coding” and “trait rating” for each method throughout the manuscript.
Results: Inter-rate reliability is not very high. Would it make any difference to exclude some of the
raters that have very limited exposure to the focal elephants (one month seems rather low)? I am also
curious as to why (on average) each mahout rated only two elephants, given that there are usually more
elephants in each camp. Having multiple ratings on each elephant should also increase the inter-rater
reliabilities.
A: It is true that ICCs are not very high, but fall in the range what is usually reported in the field (please
see our responses to other comments concerning low ICCs by Reviewer 1). Excluding less experienced
mahouts is an excellent suggestion. We looked at ICCs when we excluded less experienced mahouts
from our previous dataset (2013 to 2015) (less than 1 year of experience, less than 2 years of
experience and less than 3 years of experience). Indeed, the mean ICC values for ICC (3,1) and ICC
(3,k) increased from 0.20 and 0.34 to 0.25 and 0.40 (when mahouts with less than 1 year of experience
excluded), to 0.23 and 0.36 (when mahouts with less than 2 years of experience excluded) and to 0.24
and 0.35 (when mahouts with less than 3 years of experience excluded). There is an initial increase in
ICCs when least experienced mahouts are excluded, however the ICC values seem to stabilize around
0.23 and 0.35 when excluding mahouts with less than 2 or 3 years of experience. Considering the
accompanying drop in sample size and decrease in statistical power (e.g., < 1 year: 87 questionnaires,
25 elephants, 59 mahouts; < 2 years: 158 questionnaires, 49 elephants, 109 mahouts) we believe that
excluding less experienced raters will not significantly affect the results. It is true that there are usually
more than two elephants per camp. However, the elephants and their mahouts travelled from their own
camps to a different camp in which we took our measurements. Since most ratings occurred during the
hot season, the elephants could not spend excessive time in this camp, since the mahouts are
understandably very concerned to bring back their elephants to the forest. If the elephants don’t return
to the forest after noon they are at risk of overheating. Therefore we did not have enough time to get
every rating from every mahout on every elephant, since there are only 4 people at best who can
conduct the questionnaires with the mahouts in Burmese language simultaneously. However we always
collected ratings from the own mahout or the head mahout (who should know the elephants best).
Results: Personality structure.
Labelling the components is always tricky and subjective. I have slight doubts about the Dominance and
Neuroticism components. First, the item dominant has the word “aggressive” in the definition. It is
generally not recommended to use the name of another item in the item definition, and also some
authors have questioned whether dominance should be defined on the basis of aggression. Thus, it is
not surprising than that the two items dominant and aggressive ended up in one component. This
component thus might reflect more aggressiveness then dominance. Moreover, the item subordinate did
not load on the same component (which is usually the case in many studies that used the two (dominant
and subordinate), as it is the antonym to the dominant). Thus one might actually see Neuroticism,
where the subordinate item loaded as the reverse of Dominance (with other items (fearful, timid, and
impulsive) complying with the interpretation). The authors might re-consider the interpretations or
discuss some of the issues.
Table 2 would benefit from reordering the items on the basis of the loading values salient to each
component.
A: The reviewer has some excellent points and we agree that it is not desirable that two different items
which descriptions include the name of another item are in the questionnaire. We now simply label each
factor after the strongest loading item to avoid confusion. The factor that includes the items aggressive
and dominant is now labelled “Aggressiveness”. After our re-analysis and a strict model selection
process, we do not find the factor “Neuroticism” anymore. We are also thankful for the excellent last
suggestion and now order the items according to the strength of their loadings (table 2, l. 672).
Discussion:
p 17. Neuroticism. The authors report that previous studies based on captive elephants have generally
found a similar component, but that a study on free ranging did not. The discussion explains that
although it might seem that working elephants are closer to the captive populations, according to the
authors, they are not. One important aspect that might be add to the discussion is the experience of the
raters. It has been previously shown that raters with contrasting experiences can rate individuals
differently (Gosling 2001). Mahout’s work-related experience with elephants might resemble more those
of people working in captive conditions, rather than people who rate wild animals on the basis of
observations and not work- or management- related interactions. Also, if this would be re-labelled to
Dominance such a discussion would not be needed.
A: We agree that it is feasible that raters’ age or experience or even personality can affect the rating of
a subject in general. We address these issues now in a new paragraph in the discussion (ll. 442-.456).
In addition, after re-analysis of the data with better suited methods we do not find a factor Neuroticism
anymore. Therefore we cannot look into potential links between Neuroticism and mahouts’ age and
experience for now.
p 18. line 389-390. “The existence of the dominance factor in Asian elephants is not surprising as in
elephants dominance is related to social status.” This statement is not completely clear, the terms
dominance and social status are sometimes used interchangeably in the literature so it might be useful
to be more specific here.
A: We agree with the reviewer that this was a somewhat sloppy statement. In addition, after consulting
leading experts working on elephant behaviour and in light of our new results arising from our re-
analysis of our data, we decided not to use the expression “dominant” or “dominance” to describe a
personality factor. This is reflected in our revised version of the discussion, ll. 348-366.
p 20. The authors discussed that there was no difference between captive-born and wild-born individuals
in personality scores. Could this result be also connected to selective capture (some individuals do not
get caught), and also selective mortality in captive conditions? E.g. some personality types are harder to
catch from the wild population and at the same time not desirable to have in captive conditions (e.g.
highly aggressive ones).
A: This is a highly interesting thought and it is possible that these results are partly due to selective
appearance/disappearance. Individuals which are captured might differ in many traits (also personality)
and also because elephants have been captured by three different capture methods (stockade: capturing
whole group, milarshikar: lassoing selected individuals and immobilization: sedation of selected
individuals, Mar 2007 PhD thesis). These capture methods are likely to capture different type of
elephants; individuals which differ in age, sex or behaviour. The mortality during and after capture is
also high (e.g. Lair, RC 1997 Gone Astray: the Care and Management of the Asian Elephant in
Domesticity (FAO, Bangkok, Thailand, pp 99-131) because of harsh taming procedures. The mortality
stays high long after capture (unpublished data) and therefore it is possible that only certain type of
individuals survive long after capture and to old age.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_19
Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper on elephant personalities by Seltmann et al. The
authors' work on elephants in Myanmar is well-known, and I was excited to review this paper. Although
I think it warrants publication in RSOS, I think this paper requires substantial review and rewrite before
it can be considered for such. I am particularly concerned with the personality factors on which the
authors focused. Royal Society Open Science is a journal that will be read by many scientists and non-
scientists outside the authors' field. In addition, personality research is not a widely understood field so
although the Intro and Discussion sections provide some treatment of the field, specific explanations of
how these factors were originally described for animals and why they are relevant for elephants
specifically are needed. Personally, I do not believe these factors account satisfactorily for the variability
in individual elephant behavior, especially in wild elephants. Although the authors are experts in the field
of life history analysis, they are not experts on elephant behaviour. I would encourage the authors to
show a draft of this ms to such an expert for input; this would have been more beneficial before the
study was conducted, but I still think such input would be useful now as well. In summary, although I
think this study has merit, I would like to see the authors spent significantly more time explaining why
they chose the measures/factors they did and how these measures sufficiently explain individual
differences in elephant personalities. The authors also fail to discuss any limitations arising from asking
mahouts to judge their own elephants. I’m sure there are some.
A: Thank you for the kind words about our work on the Myanmar timber elephants. We addressed the
issues raised here by the reviewer and contacted two leading experts on behaviour of African and Asian
elephants. Their comments have considerably improved the interpretation of our results. Also, we would
like to point out that one of the co-authors (Khyne U Mar) has 50 years of experience working with
elephants.
Some points:
The title needs to be more descriptive; it’s too vague now.
A: We agree that the previous title was somewhat uninformative. The new title of the revised
manuscript is “Evaluating the personality structure of semi-captive Asian elephants living in their natural
habitat”
The first two sentences of the abstract are cumbersome; consider rewording.
A: We reworded the abstract, ll. 19-33.
Line 50: our ability TO make generalisations..
A: Corrected as suggested l. 46.
Line 70: drop the e.g.
A: Corrected as suggested l. 69.
Line 72: drop however
A: This sentence has been reworded, ll. 70-72.
Line 103-104: drop exceptionally sound, that’s a bit much.
A: We changed “exceptionally sound” to “excellent”, l. 98
Line 113-114: “…the validity of these results…is questionable. “ This is poorly worded. Are the validity of
the results questionable because one population is captive and one is “semi-captive”?
A: We replaced the unclear expression with “…and their findings may not reflect personalities of
individuals living in more natural settings.”, ll. 105-106.
Line 114: How was the wild study with African elephants conducted; this requires a bit more
explanation. Who filled out the questionnaires, or was this a strictly behavioral study?
A: We now provide some more information on the cited study and the sentence reads “…the African
elephant, where 3 to 4 experienced observers rated 26 behavioural adjectives which had previously
been used and validated in other non-human species, though the sample size …”, ll. 107-109.
Lines 119 – 124: The authors need to proofread this manuscript. There are a lot of redundancies and
grammatical errors. You say you studied the relationship between personality, elephant age, sex and
origin and then say a sentence later that you anticipated finding a relationship. Combine these sentences
or differentiate clearly between your hypotheses and predictions.
A: We are thankful for the reviewer’s attentiveness and we hope that in the new version of our
manuscript we succeeded in avoiding redundancies and grammatical errors as pointed out.
Lines 126-140: Why is this the end of the Introduction? Shouldn’t this be the end of the Discussion?
A: We are thankful for this note and we agree that this paragraph would be better placed in the
discussion. We incorporated the text into the last part of the discussion, ll. 458-476.
Line 145: Roughly 2000 – 5000. The range has to be substantially smaller than this; I understand that
no one knows how many wild Myanmar elephants there really are, but this range is too wide to be
informative. If you can't change this, explain why the range is so large
A: We do not state the estimates of the wild population anymore as these numbers, as the reviewer
states, are not really known and are only crude estimates. We therefore focus only on the more reliable
estimates of the captive population, l. 125.
Line 147-148: I don’t see how you can say the demographics of Myanmar timber elephants resemble
those of wild elephants if you have very little data on wild elephant population numbers. Please clarify.
A: We agree with the reviewer that “demographic parameters” is misleading here; we are now more
specific and reformulated the sentence to “…mortality rates [30], reproductive profiles [16] and social
behaviours [31] resembling those of truly wild elephants.”, ll. 127-128.
Line 171: Provide median measures as well; the mean age of the raters is obviously skewed by the
newest mahouts.
A: We are thankful for this comment and we now provide medians and interquartile ranges instead of
mean and SD, ll. 147-152 (see also comment 3 from the associate editor).
Results: I am a bit apprehensive about the delineation of personality factors. If these factors are
consistent across studies, as the authors state, this needs to be fleshed out more. The readers’ main
exposure to these terms is in the Results section, and the reason for these factors’ labels (either in their
use in this paper or historically) needs to be addressed in more detail. I appreciate that the Discussion
section discusses each factor already, but I’d like to see the authors explain why these factors are used
and their relevance to understanding individual differences across elephants. This needs a lot more
attention from the authors.
A: We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful comment and address these issues in a new paragraph in
the discussion, ll. 381-406.
I think the mahouts’ personalities, behavior and experiences need considerable attention in this
manuscript. Although there are some simple demographics listed, why not address the impact of
individual differences in mahouts in their assessment of individual elephant personalities? As the authors
discuss the use of common factors across non-human primate species, they should also address what’s
so unique about Myanmar timber elephants: the extensive, long-term relationship between mahouts and
elephants. Did the authors look at differences in responses between mahouts, for example, across each
personality factor? This would have been an interesting analysis. I understand this ms focuses on
elephants and not mahouts, but more attention to the latter would be very interesting. It also supports
the fact that the authors' study population in Myanmar is probably one of the best in the world for
studying elephant personalities given the large sample size, the detail of the historical data available to
the authors, and the long-standing relationship between mahouts and their elephants there.
A: We are grateful for the reviewer’s commendatory and supportive words and we are also thankful for
this constructive comment. We agree that the mahouts’ personalities, behaviour and experiences are an
important factor in how they rate their elephants’ personality. Actually we did start to collect data on
each mahout’s history and attitude towards their job, what it means to be a mahout, their relationship
and attitude towards elephants, etc. We also plan to collect questionnaires about the personality of
mahouts. We do address this issue in a new paragraph in the discussion, ll. 442-456. But as the
reviewer already mentions, we are afraid that these issues are out of the scope of this manuscript, but
we are excited to address these topics in the future.
Appendix B
The results presented in this paper are very interesting and potentially important for understanding
the complex nature of animal personalities in long-lived social mammals. Given the context of
current debates on animal personality as one mechanism for explaining individual differences in
behaviour, and that a significant problem remains with such studies that are essentially descriptive
in nature, some predictive outcomes for individuals that vary on personality dimensions are
needed to complete this paper. In the absence of validation (using behaviours, lifespan or
reproductive outcomes) the paper remains entirely descriptive and does not live up to its potential
for this study population. This reviewer is of the opinion that “this is the first study in this species” is
not quite enough to make a paper significant; lasting value will come with a greater association
between personality and outcomes for individuals.
I would also note that Grand et al.’s 2012 paper on African elephants using adjectives validated
these with cortisol assays, and their factors of fearful, effective, sociable and aggressive could be
more specifically compared with the three factors extracted here (attentive to humans, sociable,
aggressive). Horback et al.’s 2013 study (again on African elephants, all under 8 years of age) is more
difficult to interpret and uses the association between behaviour and ratings, but does apparently
end up with playful, curious and social. Both Grand et al. and Lee & Moss (factors: leadership,
playful, eccentric and social integration) used the Zunz and Stevenson-Hinde (1978) adjectives; it is
interesting that the authors of this paper did not use the same adjectives. Why not? I suspect that
this was a straightforward translation of the hominoid personality questionnaire (hence the
overemphasis on “primates” throughout this MS) to elephants. Two recent studies of wild apes have
been published; and there are other studies (langurs, macaques, baboons, hyaenas, fish, marmots,
etc., etc.) done on wild species. Is it the wild context, the social species context or the 5 factor
models that are of interest in this analysis?
So we have three elephant personality papers all suggesting that sociable, playful and
effective/aggressive might be valid descriptors. What is discussed in this paper is the fact that this
analysis found different factors, which is only to be expected as different adjectives were used?
Either these “semi-wild” elephants should show less compromised welfare and wellbeing than zoo
elephants, in which case the human-directed traits should be ignored, or they are still under the
control of people, possibly even more directly than zoo elephants kept under protected-contact
management systems. These are animals “trained” by punishment to work, they forage at night in
chains within a limited area, their welfare, immune status, and growth is compromised by work (see
Mumby et al. 2016). This does not necessarily mean that they are not viable subjects for study, but
they are not “excellent” subjects for examining basic species-specific life history traits (repeated
twice in the paper). Given that we have almost no data on individual reproduction or life history for
wild free-living Asian elephants, our understanding of what this population represents in a
comparative sense is still limited.
Specific points are as follows:
I found the introduction difficult to follow – firstly it focuses on justifying personality studies by using
coders rather than telling us what is interesting about the elephant context. The functions of
personality for elephants (or even the well-studied primates) are not clearly established. The
relevant literature is cited but not integrated.
Ln 62: perhaps explain why is anthropomorphism problematic for a species that uses sensory and
signalling modalities that are completely different from those of primates (including humans).
Ln 174: Age was shown to be an underlying variable in African elephants, was it explored at all here?
Ln 197-203: the focus on Yasui et al.’s model (mapped straight onto the 5-factor model) obscures
the other info on elephants, even though the studies were on African rather than Asian elephants.
Would you predict these extreme differences given existing comparisons (e.g. de Silva & Wittemeyer
2012)?
There is a large emphasis on the validity of the stats – put elsewhere (electronic supplementary
material)
Ln 297: well, we know elephants have personalities (see all the papers cited), the question is how
similar are these individuals?
Ln 307: please justify why zoos are different. I would point the authors towards the PLOS
compendium on captive welfare…
Ln 357: Dominance (sensu Bernstein and Hinde’s “intervening variable”) was assessed in Lee & Moss
(following from the Archie et al. 2006 work) and was used as a potential explanatory factor for
individual z scores on different factors. As was age…
Ln 431: We don’t know much about male social structure in wild Asian elephants, but in African
elephants, males are predominately social and have friends (Evans & Harris 2008, chapters in Moss
et al. 2011). So one would predict the sociability component to be just as important for males.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
The revised manuscript has now received two reviews, including one from one of the original reviewers.
Before summarising the reviewers’ concerns, I would take this opportunity to thank the authors for their
detailed and considered revisions of their manuscript, and again commend the large sample, thorough
analyses, and nuanced interpretations. However, both reviewers have a similar criticism regarding the
lack of behavioural or other data to confirm the identified personality factors and the low IRRs. Although
I agree with the reviewers that other data would be a great addition to this study, I do not believe that
this criticism makes the manuscript scientifically unsound in its current form, particularly given the
study’s strengths listed above and the authors' response to these criticisms in the first round of
revisions. I do, however, agree with the reviewers’ concerns about the underlying items used in the
questionnaire—if one goal is to compare personality dimensions in elephants to humans and other long-
lived social primates (LL91-92, 295-296), then comparable questionnaires should be used. To better
address this, could the authors please add how many items were taken from each of the elephant and
primate questionnaires at LL158-160 so that the reader can make this comparison?
A: We thank the associate editor for their encouraging words. We do agree with the associate editor and
the reviewers that correlational studies of behavioural observations or physiological measures and trait
ratings are desirable. But we are happy to see that the associate editor agrees with us that our
manuscript in its current form without those data is still scientific sound and interesting. Regarding item
selection, we added this information to the methods, ll. 162-166. We would like to point out though that
most, if not all of these questionnaires of previous studies on which we based our questionnaire are
based on or guided by items that were originally used for human personality study.
A very few minor points:
L53: humans can be rated by others, too. Perhaps add “including” before “self-assessment” here.
A: Changed as suggested, l. 53.
LL58-59: just a small point: behavioural coding can be limited by multiple factors, including missing rare
but important events for assessing personality that observers catch when spending time with the study
animals (e.g. responses to attempted predation events, etc.). I would suggest that the authors could be
a little less cautious in their wording here; at the very least, I don’t think this method has to be
presented as a second-rate alternative to behavioural coding if that method is not able to be done.
A: We agree and have removed this sentence.
L67: socialness -> sociability
A: Corrected as suggested, l. 68.
L90: remove the open bracket: (
A: Corrected as suggested, l. 92.
LL113-117: please use past tense.
A: Corrected as suggested, l. 116-120.
LL204-207: inverted commas are the wrong way around on either side of the words.
A: Corrected as suggested, l. 211-216.
L342: space required between period and “To”
A: Corrected as suggested, l. 355.
LL368-379: the following article may be useful for interpreting this result:
https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017146
A: We thank the associate editor for this helpful advice and have added a potential explanation for the
lack of a Neuroticism factor in our population, ll. 391-395.
Subject Editor Comments to the Author:
I thank the reviewers for trenchant and instructive comments. It is a particularly good insight that it is
difficult not to anthropomorphize descriptive terms, as the authors acknowledge, and that mahouts may
have different qualities to assess in their animals than behavioral scientists may have. With that said, I
think that the authors can qualify some of their discussion to include these and other considerations.
Whereas we must admit that the conditions of animal behavior studies can seldom be perfect, we also
acknowledge that using the best methods possible can still provide acceptable if not uncontroversial
results. I support the "r/r" decision mainly to give the authors more time than for a "revise" decision,
and thank the reviewers once again for their efforts.
A: We agree with the subject editor on all points and heeded the advice from reviewer 4 (comment no.
6) to mention that anthropomorphism is especially problematic for a species that uses sensory and
signalling modalities that are completely different from those of primates (ll. 62-65). Furthermore, we
now address the fact that mahouts are likely better suited to rate their elephants than researchers
(discussion, ll. 459-461) and, as we already discuss, that different mahout characteristics might
influence their ratings (discussion, ll. 461-476).

Review of Personality in semi-captive Asian elephants, submitted to Royal Society Open Science. –
revised ms
The ms has much improved in the description of the theoretical and methodical background of the study,
and of why studying elephants is important and interesting.
A: Thank you.
But basic empirical problems persist. The interrater agreement is far too low to consider these data as
reliable. It may well be that semi-captive elephants are very complex and behave very differently
towards different humans who then get very different impression of them – but this challenges the idea
elephants have consistent behavioural tendencies commonly called personality. But it may also be that
the personality constructs used are just not applicable to elephants and to the Malaysian persons asked
to assess them. There may also have been cultural and language differences – ultimately, the authors
come from Western societies, which are very different from the raters’ societies. The authors themselves
report that adjectives like gentle and sensitive made no sense to the mahouts. This may also have been
the case with the other items but raters may not have fed this information back to the researchers who
have obviously invested a lot in getting data about several hundred elephants.
A: We acknowledge the reviewer’s persistent opinion that our data are unreliable, but have to clearly
disagree once more. Yes, our interrater reliabilities are not very high, but when looking at the literature
one will find that those measures are never very high (we presented several examples in our previous
review). There are obvious cultural and language differences between people from Myanmar and Europe.
That’s why we had the questionnaire translated to Myanmar language by people from Myanmar working
with elephants and being familiar with the English language to minimize information loss during the
translation process (ll. 153-155). Furthermore, the same Myanmar colleagues asked and explained the
questions to the mahouts. Also, one of our co-authors (KUM) is from Myanmar and has extensive
knowledge on elephant behaviour, training and care. We would like to note that we asked mahouts from
Myanmar, not from Malaysia to rate elephants from Myanmar. Unfortunately, we are not able to follow
the argument why mahouts would tell us only about some items to be difficult to judge but not about
others.
Why did the authors use now Fleiss’ kappa as reliability measure – it is a measure for categorial data,
not for ordinal that are used here? This unusual selection raises questions. Maybe the reliability scores of
the ordinal reliability measures were even lower? Kappa scores should be 0.60 and higher to be
meaningful; the authors report “The values for Fleiss’ kappa ranged from 0.09 (playful) to 0.326
(moody) with a mean of 0.184. Of our 28 items, 10 showed fair agreement (> 0.20) and 18 showed
slight agreement (> 0.01) ([47]).”
From a psychometric point of view, these extremely low interrater agreement problem constitute a very
serious problem that compromises all analyses presented. Given the extremely low reliabilities, the
factorial structures reported could simply reflect semiotic patterns – therefore they are making sense to
us. But they may have only little to do with the elephant individuals in the focus of this study.
This unreliable data base may also explain the difficulties to find a model fit of these data for the
elephant personality structure presented in Yasui et al. 2013.
A: The use of kappa scores is not unusual. Many studies using trait ratings to assess personality employ
a scale of 1 to 7, which can be classified as a continuous variable for which ICCs can be used to estimate
interrater reliability. Our scale however ranged from 1 to 4, making it a categorical variable which by
nature is of ordinal character and therefore Fleiss’ kappa is an acceptable measure for interrater
reliability. We are not sure what the reviewer means by “Maybe the reliability scores of the ordinal
reliability measures were even lower?”. Furthermore, we now present information in the manuscript that
irrespective of our interrater reliability measures, the found factors still succeeded in capturing well the
underlying covariance among the items (ll. 244-245, ll. 285-287, and ll. 299-301). This suggests that it
is very unlikely that our interrater reliability values would have compromised our ability to test the
model found by Yasui et al. Factor analysis partitions variance in items into shared (caused by the
factor) and unique (measurement error related to the item) variances, therefore we can control for
unreliability in our measured variables. Regarding the poor fit of our data to the model found by Yasui et
al., we are convinced that the reason for poor model fit are the differences between our studies rather
than our interrater reliability measures.
I understand the authors have invested a great deal of effort in this study, but if personality ratings do
not provide reliable data, then they should not and cannot be used in science.
A: We thank the reviewer for acknowledging our field efforts. Regarding the point that our data are
unreliable we again have to strongly disagree. If the concern of the reviewer is based on our interrater
reliability measures, we would like to refer again to the literature which shows that our interrater
reliability values are not largely different from previous studies and that the scale reliability for the
factors we found is high irrespective of low interrater reliability, suggesting the found factors still
succeeded in capturing well the underlying covariance among the items. As we stated in our previous
revision, we do agree to some extent that those values are relatively low for the purpose of estimating
reliability of a variable in general. We repeat that this could be a critique to the whole field of personality
assessment by questionnaires and is out of the scope of our response to the reviewer nor is it in the
scope of our manuscript. It might be an interesting endeavour to look into the general credibility of
those studies.
Reviewer: 4
The results presented in this paper are very interesting and potentially important for understanding the
complex nature of animal personalities in long-lived social mammals. Given the context of current
debates on animal personality as one mechanism for explaining individual differences in behaviour, and
that a significant problem remains with such studies that are essentially descriptive in nature, some
predictive outcomes for individuals that vary on personality dimensions are needed to complete this
paper. In the absence of validation (using behaviours, lifespan or reproductive outcomes) the paper
remains entirely descriptive and does not live up to its potential for this study population. This reviewer
is of the opinion that “this is the first study in this species” is not quite enough to make a paper
significant; lasting value will come with a greater association between personality and outcomes for
individuals.
A: We believe the significance of our paper lies not in that fact that this is the first study in this species,
which, in fact, would not be true. Personality of Asian elephants has been assessed in the study by Yasui
et al. 2013 (in combination with African elephants). We state that “Our study is the first to address the
personality structure of Asian elephants living in their natural habitat” (ll. 120-121). The real significance
of our study lies in the fact that we could address the question if personality manifests in Asian
elephants with a large sample size (a prerequisite for factor analysis) and the unique situation that the
mahouts who rated the elephants very often have a long-lasting relationship with their elephants and
know a lot about their behaviour. Furthermore, the elephants of our population are living in their natural
habitat where they can express most of their natural behaviours which is not likely possible in artificial
confined zoo environments. We are aware that our study is mostly descriptive and that it recently has
been argued that to bring the field of animal personality forward, studies should be more hypothesis
driven (e.g. Dall & Griffith 2014 An empiricist guide to animal personality variation in ecology and
evolution. Front. Ecol. Evol. 2:3). However, in a species where personality has not been properly
assessed before, we need a basic study to shed light on the species’ personality structure. Only then we
can proceed to make predictions and link personality to life-history traits, behaviour and physiology on
an individual level. At the moment we are not yet able to make predictions on an individual level.
However we are excited to do so in future studies when more data becomes available for analysis. We
like to note here that the associate editor agrees with us that the lack of behavioural or other data does
not make our manuscript scientifically unsound in its current form.
I would also note that Grand et al.’s 2012 paper on African elephants using adjectives validated these
with cortisol assays, and their factors of fearful, effective, sociable and aggressive could be more
specifically compared with the three factors extracted here (attentive to humans, sociable, aggressive).
Horback et al.’s 2013 study (again on African elephants, all under 8 years of age) is more difficult to
interpret and uses the association between behaviour and ratings, but does apparently end up with
playful, curious and social. Both Grand et al. and Lee & Moss (factors: leadership, playful, eccentric and
social integration) used the Zunz and Stevenson-Hinde (1978) adjectives; it is interesting that the
authors of this paper did not use the same adjectives. Why not? I suspect that this was a
straightforward translation of the hominoid personality questionnaire (hence the overemphasis on
“primates” throughout this MS) to elephants. Two recent studies of wild apes have been published; and
there are other studies (langurs, macaques, baboons, hyenas, fish, marmots, etc., etc.) done on wild
species. Is it the wild context, the social species context or the 5 factor models that are of interest in
this analysis?
A: The reviewer addresses several points here, (a) validating traits ratings with endocrine or behavioural
measures, (b) the use of certain items/adjectives and (c) the context to which our study relates.
Regarding (a), as we pointed out in our previous review we do agree that correlational studies of
behavioural observations and trait ratings are desirable. We indeed started collecting behavioural
observations of our elephants that in future studies could be related to our trait ratings. Concerning the
studies by Grand et al. 2012 and by Horback et al. 2013, we would like to point out that an extremely
small sample size of 5 or 12 elephants, respectively, perhaps does not justify a “validation” of any
measurement. In general, the results and interpretations of complex animal studies employing a sample
size of 12 or even smaller should be handled with care. We do however refer to the results from Grand
et al. 2012 several times in our discussion. With regard to point (b), we based the items of our
questionnaire on items used in Grand et al. 2012, Yasui et al. 2013 and Konecna et al. 2008 (see
methods 2.2. Collection of Personality Data). The questionnaire used in Grand et al. 2012 is based on
the adjectives suggested by Stevenson-Hinde & Zunz 1978, therefore 15 of the items that we used were
based on adjectives from the original Stevenson-Hinde & Zunz 1978 paper. Our items were not a
straightforward translation of the hominoid personality questionnaire, but were partly based on it. The
questionnaire used in Yasui et al. 2013 is based on Konno et al. 2011 Androgen receptor gene
polymorphisms are associated with aggression in Japanese Akita Inu. Biol Lett 7:658–660 and the
questionnaire used in Konencna et al. 2008 is based on Weiss et al. 2006 Personality and subjective
well-being in orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus and Pongo abelii). J Pers Soc Psychol 90, 501–511, which is
in turn based on King & Figueredo 1997 The Five-Factor Model plus Dominance in chimpanzee
personality. J Res Pers 31, 257–271, which in turn was based on Goldberg 1990 An alternative
‘‘description of personality’’: The Big-Five structure. J Pers Soc Psychol 59, 1216–1229, which in turn
was based on Norman 1967 2,800 personality trait descriptors: Normative operating characteristics for a
university population. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, Department of Psychological Sciences. In
essence, every questionnaire used in animal personality studies is based ultimately on items originally
used in human personality research. The focus of our paper is on personality in long-lived highly social
mammals, therefore elephants and primates are in the focus, also because of their similar life-histories,
which makes the comparison interesting. Of course also cetaceans qualify as long-lived highly social
mammals, however the literature on personality of cetaceans is not as abundant as on primates (see
also: Frick E.E., de Vere A.J., Kuczaj S.A. (2017) What Do We Want to Know About Personality in Marine
Mammals?. In: Vonk J., Weiss A., Kuczaj S. (eds) Personality in Nonhuman Animals. Springer, Cham.).
Concerning (c), it is all three of them. We are interested how personality manifests in natural habitats
with regard to the species’ social environment and how our results relate to previously results. We think
we address all three aspects in our manuscript.
So we have three elephant personality papers all suggesting that sociable, playful and
effective/aggressive might be valid descriptors. What is discussed in this paper is the fact that this
analysis found different factors, which is only to be expected as different adjectives were used?
A: The reviewer is right. We did not expect a 100% match with previous findings and surely expected
differences. We compare our results to previously found personality structures and discuss the
similarities and differences. Furthermore we put our results in a wider context (please see discussion).
Either these “semi-wild” elephants should show less compromised welfare and wellbeing than zoo
elephants, in which case the human-directed traits should be ignored, or they are still under the control
of people, possibly even more directly than zoo elephants kept under protected-contact management
systems. These are animals “trained” by punishment to work, they forage at night in chains within a
limited area, their welfare, immune status, and growth is compromised by work (see Mumby et al.
2016). This does not necessarily mean that they are not viable subjects for study, but they are not
“excellent” subjects for examining basic species-specific life history traits (repeated twice in the paper).
Given that we have almost no data on individual reproduction or life history for wild free-living Asian
elephants, our understanding of what this population represents in a comparative sense is still limited.
A: We are not sure what exactly the reviewer wants to point out here. We are happy to be corrected,
but to us it sounds like this comment is not a criticism on our manuscript but a general criticism towards
the Myanmar Timber Elephant Project. The reviewer states that elephants from our population “are not
“excellent” subjects for examining basic species-specific life history traits (repeated twice in the paper)”
and does not refer to assessing personality. We are well aware that not much is known about actual wild
Asian elephants and we note that fact in most of our publications when relevant and never claim that
our elephants are wild individuals in the narrow sense. However they do differ from zoo elephants in a
way that they can express a range of natural behaviours, can associate (and mate) with a large number
of other timber and wild elephants, forage free at night (yes, some elephants have chains around their
legs, but they are generally not chained to a tree or other object), receive no extra food supplements
and reproduction is not managed by humans. All these characteristics makes them markedly different
from elephants living in confined artificial zoo environments and situates them somewhere between
captive and wild elephants, hence the expression “semi-captive” (see methods ll. 129-140). This would
probably be true even if we knew everything about wild free-living Asian elephants. We disagree that
these individuals are not constituting “excellent” subjects for examining basic species-specific life history
traits. For studying life history traits of a long-lived mammal with a high sample size as this, it is as
close as one gets to wild Asian elephants, since it is extremely difficult if not impossible to study truly
wild populations in forested habitats. We are not criticising the welfare and wellbeing of captive
elephants from zoos in this manuscript. Furthermore, we do not understand the argument why being
under control of people (in our case training, working and veterinarian care; these elephants are under
control of humans since they work with them) would lower their welfare and wellbeing and why human-
directed traits should be ignored when individuals of our semi-captive population express better welfare
and wellbeing compared to zoo elephants (e.g. Clubb et al 2008 Compromised survivorship in zoo
elephants. Science 322, 1649; Mar et al. 2012 Causes and Correlates of Calf Mortality in Captive Asian
Elephants (Elephas maximus). PLoS ONE 7: e32335). Since there is no Mumby et al. 2016 we assume
the reviewer refers to Mumby et al. 2015 Stress and body condition are associated with demography of
Asian elephants. Conservation Physiology 3:1, which states “…the proximate causes of low body weight,
such as disease, undernutrition, malnutrition or overwork, may take time to influence mortality through
either direct debility or indirect effects on immune function”. We would like to note that overwork rarely
happens in our study population since work times are strictly regulated by the government.
Specific points are as follows:
I found the introduction difficult to follow – firstly it focuses on justifying personality studies by using
coders rather than telling us what is interesting about the elephant context. The functions of personality
for elephants (or even the well-studied primates) are not clearly established. The relevant literature is
cited but not integrated.
A: We believe that our introduction follows a clear line: First we briefly address animal personality in
general, its causes and consequences and reasons for why it might evolve in the first place. We then
address the different main methods of how to assess animal personality. We continue to make a point
why elephants are an interesting study subject for researching animal personality also in comparison to
other long-lived highly social species. Finally we address the aims of our study. That personality has
ultimate causes is addressed in the first paragraph in the introduction and not much is known about the
consequences of personality in elephants. This was not in the scope of this manuscript and we refer the
reviewer to the discussion (e.g. ll. 344-346, ll. 395-396, ll.481-496) where we point out that future
studies will be able to address these questions.
Ln 62: perhaps explain why is anthropomorphism problematic for a species that uses sensory and
signalling modalities that are completely different from those of primates (including humans).
A: This is an excellent point raised by the reviewer, thank you. We added a sentence to the introduction
to address this issue, ll. 62-65.
Ln 174: Age was shown to be an underlying variable in African elephants, was it explored at all here?
A: We decided not to include age in this study since a proper longitudinal examination is out of the
scope of this manuscript. Exploring age effects would mean that we first have to examine measurement
invariance with respect to age and then model some trends in personality traits. We are hopefully able
to do so in the future with an even larger sample size.
Ln 197-203: the focus on Yasui et al.’s model (mapped straight onto the 5-factor model) obscures the
other info on elephants, even though the studies were on African rather than Asian elephants. Would
you predict these extreme differences given existing comparisons (e.g. de Silva & Wittemeyer 2012)?
A: We decided to focus on the model found by Yasui et al. since it was the only study including Asian
elephants. There might indeed be not a large difference in personality structure between African and
Asian elephants. However, as we pointed out above, the other studies looking at elephant personality
had extremely low sample sizes and the model by Yasui et al. is at least based on more than 70
elephants (compared to 5 in Grand et al. 2012, 11 in Lee & Moss 2012 and 12 in Horback et al. 2013)
which makes their findings less reliable than the one in Yasui et al. 2013.
There is a large emphasis on the validity of the stats – put elsewhere (electronic supplementary
material)
A: We tend to disagree with the reviewer that the emphasis on the validity of the stats is too large to be
in the main body of the manuscript. One of our goals was to validate the personality structure proposed
by Yasui et al. 2013 with our data. Furthermore, not all readers might be too familiar with factor analysis
and we are of the opinion that referring to an electronic supplementary file for the validity of statistics
might just create unnecessary confusion.
Ln 297: well, we know elephants have personalities (see all the papers cited), the question is how
similar are these individuals?
A: This is a good question, which we plan to address in future studies when we will be able to link
personality to behavioural observations, endocrinological measures and reproductive data. This was
however not the focus of this manuscript, which shall serve as a basic assessment if and how personality
manifests in Asian elephants living in their natural habitat in the first place. We are excited to address
this question in the near future and we are happy to see that the reviewer is curious about that issue as
well.
Ln 307: please justify why zoos are different. I would point the authors towards the PLOS compendium
on captive welfare…
A: Personality is assessed by observing behaviours. Living in their natural habitat, surrounded by a large
number of semi-captive and wild elephants, the individuals of our study population can express more
natural behaviours than elephants confined to artificial zoo environments. We added this information to
the discussion (ll. 317-320). Therefore we are confident that our personality assessment of semi-captive
individuals captured more natural variation in behaviour then the Yasui et al. study which was conducted
on individuals living in zoos. Personality is not assessed by welfare, however it can be related to
wellbeing (e.g. Weiss et al. 2006 Personality and subjective well-being in orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus
and Pongo abelii). J Pers Soc Psychol 90, 501–511) but this was not a question in this study.
Ln 357: Dominance (sensu Bernstein and Hinde’s “intervening variable”) was assessed in Lee & Moss
(following from the Archie et al. 2006 work) and was used as a potential explanatory factor for individual
z scores on different factors. As was age…
A: We do not claim that dominance was not assessed at all in Lee & Moss 2012, we say “dominance as a
trait itself was not assessed in their study”. This means there was no trait assessed that would directly
link to dominance and underwent the principal component analysis which could have been a potential
reason they did not find a “dominance” personality factor. We changed this ambiguous sentence to
“However, dominance as a trait itself was not included in the principal component analysis in their
study” (ll. 370-371). Furthermore, we continue to discuss that dominance is not just one behaviour and
that we should perhaps relabel the trait in our future studies (discussion ll. 371-375). Dominance was
related to one personality factor (leadership) found by Lee & Moss 2012 and yes, age was related to the
factor playful in their study.
Ln 431: We don’t know much about male social structure in wild Asian elephants, but in African
elephants, males are predominately social and have friends (Evans & Harris 2008, chapters in Moss et
al. 2011). So one would predict the sociability component to be just as important for males.
A: Both statements of the reviewer about Asian and African elephants are true. However, as pointed out
in Sukumar 2003 The living elephants: evolutionary ecology, behavior, and conservation. Oxford: Oxford
University Press. (Chapter 4, page 181), “Among Asian elephants in dry forest, the bulls again range
mostly solitary”. Therefore we prefer to retain our predication that close relationships with other
individuals may therefore be less important for males than for females. We do not state that social
interactions between male elephants are not important at all. Independent of our prediction, there
seems to be no differences between the sexes in Sociability in our population anyway.
Appendix D
Many thanks for the final suggestions by the Associate Editor Alecia Carter on our manuscript RSOS-
172026 entitled “Evaluating the personality structure of semi-captive Asian elephants living in their
natural habitat”. We are thankful for the possibility to revise and resubmit the manuscript with regard to
these comments. We addressed these comments and sincerely hope that our revisions have made the
manuscript acceptable for publication in Royal Society Open Science. Our response starts with “A:”.
Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Alecia Carter):
I again thank the authors for their considered and thorough revisions of this manuscript. My previous
praises of the study stand, so I will not reiterate them here. However, given the continued concern of
reviewer 1 in the previous round of revisions, I encourage the authors to address briefly but explicitly
the relatively low IRRs of the items in their initial presentation of them, and the justification for
continuing with them in the subsequent analyses. E.g. at L252, the authors could add a sentence or two
similar to their response to the reviewer, along the lines of "although these scores are arguably low,
they are in line with other published studies [examples] and we have chosen to include all of them in our
subsequent analyses". Please be explicit as to why the authors have made this decision here so the
reader is aware that this is not as straightforward as it currently seems. In addition, at LL478-479, it
may be better to be more cautious here given the low IRRs of the items--remove the term "reliably" as
this reliability was only "slight" to "fair" (LL250-252) and the current wording is not representative of the
ambiguity in these data.
A: Once again we are thankful for the editor’s positive words. We agree that the issue of low IRRs should
also be briefly addressed in manuscript itself. As the editor suggests we added more information
concerning this issue (ll. 252-259) and removed the term “reliably” in l. 486.
We would also like to thank all reviewers for their valuable and very helpful comments which improved
the manuscript substantially.
