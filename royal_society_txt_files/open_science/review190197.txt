The article utilized the sediments from Beian River in North China to produce construction
materials and also the properties for the sediments were characterized. The orthogonal
experimental design was adopted to determine the optimum conditions and corresponding
evaluation methods were also performed. I think the paper could be considered for publication
with the following issues resolved:
1) As the writer indicated, the sediments contained some PAHs, particularly for the sediments
in downside of the river, during the treatment will these materials decrease completely?
2) The sediments were used for ceramsite production, is this the best resource technology, or is
there any other alternative for the utilization of the sediment?
3) The sample position is in north China, will the location affect the property and utilization of
the sediments?

The sediments in the river are of great importance for environmental safety of the river. More and
more research demonstrated that the proper treatment of the sediments would reduce the
pollution source for the river. This paper investigated the pollution characteristic of the
sediments and carried out research on resource technology. The paper contained the following
3
problems, after the revision of paper it could be considered for publication in the journal.
1) The author mentioned several technologies for sediments utilization, why ceramsite
production was adopted in this study?
2) What would be the total volume of the sediments in this area, did the author think of the
economic feasibility of the process?
3) The author investigated the product quality of the product and showed the environmental
safety of the product, so will the quality of the product fulfill its utilization requirement?

Good paper. This study is interesting and meaningful to sediment disposal. There are a few
comments to the authors before publication.
1. This study focused on using the sediment in Beian River to produce ceramsite. Is it suitable for
other sediment in other rivers? It will be very meaningful if the authors can illustrate which
sediment in river is suitable for produce ceramsite.
2. The conclusion seems like a summary of the work. The authors should state the new technical
or scientific findings in here.
3. Some sentences are difficult to be read, such as the first paragraph in the section 2.2.3 and the
second paragraph in the section 2.3.1.
