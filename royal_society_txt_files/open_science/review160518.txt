I have one comment for revision, I think it would be useful on Figure A1 to put the taxonomic
name under each molar, so it is easier to compare the character across taxa. Other than that, I
look forward to seeing this manuscript published. This is an excellent contribution to early
amphicyonid systematics and your work is exceptionally clear and well-founded in the fossil
data.

I had very few issues with this paper in general - it is well written and documented. I think the
major concern is that it is really not appropriate for Proceedings B - there is far too much minute
dental and cranial anatomical detail for a general scientific audience to grasp. The topic
(origination of amphicyonids) potentially could be of broad interest but in the end the paper
doesn't really convincingly establish either the time or the place of origin of this group. I think
this would be much better received in in either a vertebrate paleontology journal or better yet a
journal specializing in systematics and taxonomy.

The paper was well written and clear, and I have only one minor sugestion. I think it would be
beneficial for the authors describe in more detail what is meant by "basioccipital embayment".
While this character is doubtlessly described in detail elsewhere, some readers will appreciate a
brief description here without having to consult other references. This would be especially
helpful as this character plays such a large role in the phylogenetic analysis.
I found the paper overall to be easy to follow. I thank the authors for doing their part to sort out
the mess that is the genus "Miacis."

Dear Dr Tomiya
On behalf of the Editors, I am pleased to inform you that your Manuscript RSOS-160518 entitled
"Whence the beardogs? Reappraisal of the middle to late Eocene “Miacis” from Texas, USA, and
the origin of Amphicyonidae (Mammalia, Carnivora)" has been accepted for publication in Royal
Society Open Science subject to minor revision in accordance with the referee suggestions. Please
find the referees' comments at the end of this email.

The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript.
• Ethics statement
If your study uses humans or animals please include details of the ethical approval received,
including the name of the committee that granted approval. For human studies please also detail
whether informed consent was obtained. For field studies on animals please include details of all
permissions, licences and/or approvals granted to carry out the fieldwork.
• Data accessibility
It is a condition of publication that all supporting data are made available either as
supplementary information or preferably in a suitable permanent repository. The data
accessibility section should state where the article's supporting data can be accessed. This section
should also include details, where possible of where to access other relevant research materials
such as statistical tools, protocols, software etc can be accessed. If the data has been deposited in
an external repository this section should list the database, accession number and link to the DOI
for all data from the article that has been made publicly available. Data sets that have been
deposited in an external repository and have a DOI should also be appropriately cited in the
manuscript and included in the reference list.
If you wish to submit your supporting data or code to Dryad (http://datadryad.org/), or modify
your current submission to dryad, please use the following link:

• Competing interests
Please declare any financial or non-financial competing interests, or state that you have no
competing interests.
• Authors’ contributions
All submissions, other than those with a single author, must include an Authors’ Contributions
section which individually lists the specific contribution of each author. The list of Authors
should meet all of the following criteria; 1) substantial contributions to conception and design, or
acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it
critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be published.
All contributors who do not meet all of these criteria should be included in the
acknowledgements.
We suggest the following format:
AB carried out the molecular lab work, participated in data analysis, carried out sequence
alignments, participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript; CD carried out
the statistical analyses; EF collected field data; GH conceived of the study, designed the study,
coordinated the study and helped draft the manuscript. All authors gave final approval for
publication.
• Acknowledgements
Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship
criteria.
• Funding statement
Please list the source of funding for each author.

Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days (i.e. by the 06-Sep-2016). If you do not think
you will be able to meet this date please let me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) Included your supplementary files in a format you are happy with (no line numbers,
vancouver referencing, track changes removed etc) as these files will NOT be edited in
production
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.
Kind regards,

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-160518)
Dear Editors:
Thank you for the prompt review of our manuscript. We have modified Figures A1-3 following
the suggestion by Reviewer 1. In addition, we have made minor corrections to the text (all
corrections appear in red in the revised ms.) and to the character matrix data (which did not
change the resulting tree topology or any of the main conclusions). The character matrix data
(Electronic Supplementary Materials 1 & 2) have been deposited in the Dryad Digital Repository:
http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5cb57. The newly erected genera, Angelarctocyon and
Gustafsonia, have been registered on ZooBank in accordance with the ICZN.
Sincerely,
Susumu Tomiya & Zhijie Jack Tseng
