E-Music Box review
This manuscript by Novembre and colleagues presents a new tool to examine music production
and interaction. The paper also presents an experiment demonstrating the effectiveness of the
system and innovative empirical results (e.g., low pitch dominance in timing).
The device is novel and interesting, and will surely be useful to many researchers in the field.
Instructions how to build the device are published in supplementary material and will facilitate
its adoption. The manuscript is in great shape, and in my opinion could be published as is.
A few very minor questions/comments:
p. 8, line 5: consider changing “5 points” to “5 point” Likert scale.
p. 8. To explicate the low-frequency effect, please provide the tone and register of the first tone:
e.g., High pitch = C4 and Low pitch = C2. The paper currently doesn’t specific what register is
used.
p. 10, last line of first paragraph. Missing apostrophe in “the codes’ timing”.
p. 18, line 2. To differentiate measured from instructed leader/follower relationships. You could
add “instructed” to “These results indicated that instructed followers ….”

Open Science Manuscript: The E-Music Box: an empirical method for exploring the universal
capacity for musical production and for social interaction through music.
3
The manuscript by Novembre and colleagues describes a novel method to study music in
interaction. The authors built a modern-day, electromechanical version of the Music Box. This
device enables mapping human-produced rotational movements to the playback speed of a
prerecorded song. The authors present data from an experiment where pairs of participants were
required to synchronise the performance of a musical theme (played by one participant) and its
transposed version (played by the other).
The manuscript is well-written and to the point. It has been a pleasure to read it, both for its novel
contents and general organisation. The manuscript contains several features that show how the
authors have spent time designing the experiment and thinking about a potential
multidisciplinary readership, e.g. clear figures, often double notation/explanations (music and
acoustic), effect size calculation before the experiment. I recommend this manuscript for
publication, but I would appreciate to see the authors’ answers to a few queries.
GENERAL COMMENTS
*Figure 1 and Figure 2 are well made, clear and helpful to understand the methodology and
experiment. I would only recommend an additional Figure (or Table) to explain the only part of
the methods that I could not fully understand, namely how movements are mapped to sounds. I
am not saying what is already in Figure 1D, rather examples of pieces of information going
through all steps in 1D. A sound (or a silence) is produced by combinations of a circular
movement of many possible degrees and an upcoming note duration of several possible length,
so some examples would make the whole sound production process clearer to the reader. I leave
it to the authors and the editor if the additional information will be presented as a Figure, Table
or normal text.
*The authors should include in the introduction/discussion, and in the general message of the
paper, the answer to a question: Why is this custom-build piece of hardware better than any
commercially available solution? I am not implying it is not, but it would be important to
mention this. For instance, I would mention why a Contour Shuttle Express/Pro (approx 50 euros
in Germany), a mouse scroller or even a notebook trackpad (say with a circular sticker to guide
participants) are a less effective solution to track continuous circular movements produced by a
participant than the custom-built E-Music Box. Please notice that this refers only to the hardware,
not the software which is definitely indispensable. (Should the authors need some inspiration, I
proposed some hopefully convincing arguments while building ad-hoc “musical instruments” for
chimpanzees. Should you be interested in reading them, though no need to, my arguments
appear in: Ravignani et al.,2013,Sensors).
*Why didn’t the authors use time series analysis to analyse the data? For instance, a multivariate
regression of the two time series and a test for Granger causality would have been, in my opinion,
the straightforward way to test who influences whom [G-causality and other techniques used in
musica can be found e.g. in F PapiotisP, MarchiniM, Perez-CarrilloA and
MaestreE(2014)Measuring ensemble interdependence in a string quartet through analysis of
multidimensional performance data. Front.Psychol. 5:963.] If you still thinkANOVAs are the best
way, you do not need to reanalize data, although Python supports a really simple and handy
package for time series/G-causality analyses.
*The authors should put their new methodology more in perspective, by mentioning previous
technological inventions by others. For instance, the D-Jogger and other solutions

]
I cannot judge paragraph 4.3, pgg.24-26, because I am not knowledgeable and competent enough
on neurologic therapy.
Some previous research tested pairs of participants on their ability to synchronize with each other
while uttering streams of nonsense syllables (e.g. Bowling, Herbst & Fitch, 2013 and research
cited there). The syllable experiments could (by some definitions) be considered a form of music
and, similarly to the present study, the participants could freely control single element onsets and
pauses without musical expertise. What is then the crucial conceptual distinction between the
synchronized syllables experiments and the research in the present manuscript?
SPECIFIC COMMENTS
pg.4, line 44: how widespread are the two practises mentioned? It would be good to include a
quantifier and possibly a citation here.
pg.5, last paragraph. The statement “To the extent that our method…” is very appropriate. It’s
also good that the authors provide some predictions. While I can understand and agree with
Prediction2 (both music theory and music cognition would suggest that), I do not necessarily
agree with Prediction1. Could the authors please provide a citation for that?
pg.14, line 20. I would like to know more about how the data were interpolated. In particular, if
the “input” of the interpolation was datapoints at 960Hz and the output at 100Hz, were the
interpolated points unevenly spaced between the original data points?
pg.14, line 30. “Unwrapped” is not a common word in biology, music psychology or general
statistics. The authors should explain it.
pg.22,lines28-34. I have some problems with this statement and the synchronization statements in
general. I am not sure that this method enables showing interpersonal synchronization between
participants. If I have understood the methods fully and correctly, there are many behaviors in
the experimental setup which can produce a synchronous performance. Two participants keeping
the same constant rotation speed would produce synchronized music. This might even work if
they did not listen to each other but just had internalized the pulse of the metronome and started
once this was over. For the sake of argument, even a pair of animals or robots, starting a constant
circular movement upon the “go” signal might produce synchronization as a by-product of their
constant behaviour. More in general, whenever participants reach zero lag and keep the same
*average* angular velocity, they will produce synchronized music. But there are several ways of
having a given *average* angular velocity, many of which are non-synchronous behaviours. For
instance, one participant could cover 90 degrees in 3 seconds at constant speed (avg=30deg/sec),
while the other starts very quickly, covering the first 80 degrees in 1 second, then takes a rest for 1
second, and does the last 10degrees in 1 second. This non-synchronous behaviour would produce
a synchronous musical performance, correct? My apologies in advance if I am wrong.
MINOR POINTS
Just an idea: how about Music E-Box instead of the E-Music Box? My suggestion, which you
should by no means feel obliged to adopt, (1) puts the emphasis on the fact that is the Box in the
Music Box which is now electronic, and (2) sounds slightly better by getting rid of the “cb’ sound.
pg.4, line 34: is the song title correctly cited?
pg.28, Is Amengual et al., in the correct citation style?
5
I noticed in the review portal that the manuscript has already been in review for several months.
So, if the authors need a quick response, I will be glad to provide one as soon as the queries are
answered.

Abstract: Humans are assumed to have a natural – universal – predisposition for making music
and for musical interaction. Research in this domain is, however, typically conducted with
musically trained individuals, and therefore confounded with expertise. Here we present a
rediscovered and updated invention – the E-Music Box – that we establish as an empirical
method to investigate musical production and interaction in everyone. The E-Music Box
transforms rotatory cyclical movements into pre-programmable digital musical output, with
tempo varying according to rotation speed. The user’s movements are coded as continuous
oscillatory data, which can be analyzed using linear or nonlinear analytical tools. We conducted a
proof-of-principle experiment to demonstrate that, using this method, pairs of non-musically
trained individuals can interact according to conventional musical practices (leader/follower
roles and lower-pitch dominance). The results suggest that the E-Music Box brings ‘active’ and
‘interactive’ musical capacities within everyone’s reach. We discuss the potential of this method
for exploring the universal predisposition for music making and interaction in developmental
and cross-cultural contexts, and for neurologic musical therapy and rehabilitation.

queries.
We are glad the reviewer enjoyed reading the manuscript. We endeavor to answer all the
queries below.
GENERAL COMMENTS
*Figure 1 and Figure 2 are well made, clear and helpful to understand the methodology and
experiment. I would only recommend an additional Figure (or Table) to explain the only part
of the methods that I could not fully understand, namely how movements are mapped to
sounds. I am not saying what is already in Figure 1D, rather examples of pieces of
information going through all steps in 1D. A sound (or a silence) is produced by
combinations of a circular movement of many possible degrees and an upcoming note
duration of several possible length, so some examples would make the whole sound
production process clearer to the reader. I leave it to the authors and the editor if the
additional information will be presented as a Figure, Table or normal text.
The reviewer is right. We actually had a schematic illustration of this in Figure 2 (bottom
part, middle). However, after reading the manuscript again we noticed that we never
referred to this in the text. The manuscript has now been revised, and the reader is pointed
to that part of figure 2 when we explain how movements are mapped onto sounds.
Furthermore, we have provided some more technical details when the device is introduced
in section 1.1.
*The authors should include in the introduction/discussion, and in the general message of
the paper, the answer to a question: Why is this custom-build piece of hardware better than
any commercially available solution? I am not implying it is not, but it would be important to
mention this. For instance, I would mention why a Contour Shuttle Express/Pro (approx 50
euros in Germany), a mouse scroller or even a notebook trackpad (say with a circular sticker
to guide participants) are a less effective solution to track continuous circular movements
produced by a participant than the custom-built E-Music Box. Please notice that this refers
only to the hardware, not the software which is definitely indispensable. (Should the authors
need some inspiration, I proposed some hopefully convincing arguments while building ad-
hoc “musical instruments” for chimpanzees. Should you be interested in reading them,
though no need to, my arguments appear in: Ravignani et al.,2013,Sensors).
In the revised manuscript (section 2.3), we provide a list of reasons that motivated our
choices in building the E-Music Box in this particular way. We also refer to the article by
Ravignani et al., 2013.
*Why didn’t the authors use time series analysis to analyse the data? For instance, a
multivariate regression of the two time series and a test for Granger causality would have
been, in my opinion, the straightforward way to test who influences whom [G-causality and
other techniques used in musica can be found e.g. in F PapiotisP, MarchiniM, Perez-CarrilloA
and MaestreE(2014)Measuring ensemble interdependence in a string quartet through
analysis of multidimensional performance data. Front.Psychol. 5:963.] If you still
thinkANOVAs are the best way, you do not need to reanalize data, although Python supports
a really simple and handy package for time series/G-causality analyses.
We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestions about alternative analyses.
The d(1,2) measure described in the manuscript is in fact the result of time series analysis.
This method was developed by Rosenblum & Pikovsky (2001) to especially detect the
directionality of the coupling between two self-sustained oscillators by estimating the ratio
of the coupling terms from phase time series.
Given our experimental question (i.e. about directionality) and the nature of the dataset (i.e.
phase time series), we believe this is a straightforward analytical method. While we
considered other analytical approaches (including Granger prediction), we did not find them
to carry significant advantages over and above our analysis, and we would prefer to leave
the paper as it is in this regard.
*The authors should put their new methodology more in perspective, by mentioning
previous technological inventions by others. For instance, the D-Jogger and other solutions

We now refer to this literature in section 1.1.
I cannot judge paragraph 4.3, pgg.24-26, because I am not knowledgeable and competent
enough on neurologic therapy.
Some previous research tested pairs of participants on their ability to synchronize with each
other while uttering streams of nonsense syllables (e.g. Bowling, Herbst & Fitch, 2013 and
research cited there). The syllable experiments could (by some definitions) be considered a
form of music and, similarly to the present study, the participants could freely control single
element onsets and pauses without musical expertise. What is then the crucial conceptual
distinction between the synchronized syllables experiments and the research in the present
manuscript?
Whether the practice described above should be considered to rely upon musical
predispositions, or upon the general ability to synchronize movements with others, is
arguable. It is the case, however, that joint singing for example is a widespread behavior and
observable also irrespective of expertise.
We believe that – from an experimental perspective – the E-Music Boxes provide a more
controllable and accessible approach to joint music making than the study of joint singing. It
is more controllable because movement/output parameters can be preprogrammed. So the
E-Music box allows for higher flexibility in terms of the timbres, scales, and tunings. This in
turn permits researchers to overcome constraints related to inter-individual, inter–cultural
and inter–age differences, and has important consequences with respect to the applications
for neurologic therapy and rehabilitation. The E-Music Box methodology is more accessible
because it relies on a simple type of action, which more individuals might be willing to
perform for experimental purposes (as compared to singing). It is also more accessible to
experimenters, because less sophisticated preprocessing and analytical techniques are
required to analyze datasets like the one we presented here compared to voice recordings.
All our arguments appear in the revised manuscript (see sections 1.1, 2.3, 4.2 and 4.3).
SPECIFIC COMMENTS
pg.4, line 44: how widespread are the two practises mentioned? It would be good to include
a quantifier and possibly a citation here.
We replaced “culturally widespread” with “common”.
pg.5, last paragraph. The statement “To the extent that our method…” is very appropriate.
It’s also good that the authors provide some predictions. While I can understand and agree
with Prediction2 (both music theory and music cognition would suggest that), I do not
necessarily agree with Prediction1. Could the authors please provide a citation for that?
We now refer to the paper by Keller and Appel (2010).
pg.14, line 20. I would like to know more about how the data were interpolated. In
particular, if the “input” of the interpolation was datapoints at 960Hz and the output at
100Hz, were the interpolated points unevenly spaced between the original data points?
This was a misunderstanding. We now make clear that the Arduino outputs data only when
the plastic handle is turned, with maximal temporal resolution of 960Hz. Accordingly, this
output was not recorded at a regular rate by Presentation software, and thus, the data
needed to be interpolated to be equally spaced in time for analysis purposes.
pg.14, line 30. “Unwrapped” is not a common word in biology, music psychology or general
statistics. The authors should explain it.
We did so in a footnote.
pg.22,lines28-34. I have some problems with this statement and the synchronization
statements in general. I am not sure that this method enables showing interpersonal
synchronization between participants. If I have understood the methods fully and correctly,
there are many behaviors in the experimental setup which can produce a synchronous
performance. Two participants keeping the same constant rotation speed would produce
synchronized music. This might even work if they did not listen to each other but just had
internalized the pulse of the metronome and started once this was over. For the sake of
argument, even a pair of animals or robots, starting a constant circular movement upon the
“go” signal might produce synchronization as a by-product of their constant behaviour.
More in general, whenever participants reach zero lag and keep the same *average* angular
velocity, they will produce synchronized music. But there are several ways of having a given
*average* angular velocity, many of which are non-synchronous behaviours. For instance,
one participant could cover 90 degrees in 3 seconds at constant speed (avg=30deg/sec),
while the other starts very quickly, covering the first 80 degrees in 1 second, then takes a
rest for 1 second, and does the last 10degrees in 1 second. This non-synchronous behaviour
would produce a synchronous musical performance, correct? My apologies in advance if I
am wrong.
We now specify “synchronization of the musical sounds”.
Our measures of coupling directionality provide evidence that the participants adapted to
each other’s performance timing, which is not consistent with the idea of apparent
synchrony arising merely as a side effect (or epiphenomenon) of constant circular
movement.
MINOR POINTS
Just an idea: how about Music E-Box instead of the E-Music Box? My suggestion, which you
should by no means feel obliged to adopt, (1) puts the emphasis on the fact that is the Box
in the Music Box which is now electronic, and (2) sounds slightly better by getting rid of the
“cb’ sound.
We prefer to keep “E-Music Box” because “E-Box” is used for other devices (used for
entertainment) and because we would like to keep the string “Music Box” unaltered.
pg.4, line 34: is the song title correctly cited?
The reviewer is correct. The citation has been corrected.
pg.28, Is Amengual et al., in the correct citation style?
The revised manuscript’s citation style has been changed to Vancouver, and the citation
style for this article is now correct.
I noticed in the review portal that the manuscript has already been in review for several
months. So, if the authors need a quick response, I will be glad to provide one as soon as the
queries are answered.
