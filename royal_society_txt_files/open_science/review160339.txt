The ms by Peso et al is generally a solid behavioural analysis of female movement in a fiddler
crab. The study is well designed, although may suffer a little bit from slightly low sample size (a
general problem in these types of studies where the work can be quite difficult and time
consuming). I don't believe the sample size is a major issue, but it does raise a question of power
at one or two points (as mentioned below).
Lines 216-220 vs Lines 243-246. This is the exact same contrast, reported twice (14/32 vs 7/27), yet
using a slightly different statistical test. Why report this outcome twice?
Related to the previous comment, given the relatively small sample sizes, I'd be curious about a
basic power analysis: how large a difference would there need to be in order for you to find a
difference? Apparently 44% and 26% (which "feel" rather different) are not significantly different
at this sample size. What would be?
Minor comments:
lines 40-41: the list of negative outcomes of mate searching is a little specific to fiddler crabs, even
though they haven't been mentioned in the text yet.
Line 50-52: "In the wasp..." While an interesting factoid, this sentence has nothing to do with the
primary thrust of the paragraph, which is about female searching, not male's pretending to be
females.
Line 77: "...if she selects to mate..." I believe "selects" should be "elects"
Lines 270-277: given that it has been famously reported in the past that males will wave at just
about anything vaguely fiddler sized moving around the surface (clawless males, females from
other species, spools of thread, etc.), the fact that they didn't distinguishing between wandering
and resident females of the correct species is hardly a surprise. In fact, I would have been more
surprised if they had reacted differently.

This paper shows that there is very little difference between the responses that females of a
species of fiddler crab make to courting males when those females are sexually receptive and
seeking mates and when they are not receptive (do not choose a mate) but are seeking burrows
for shelter. Although there are some problems with the report (less so with the study per se) this
is a very important result. It challenges the nearly universal assumption that female responses to
male courtship signals and displays evolve as a consequence of the fitness effects of mating and
breeding with males that use certain signals and displays and not others. Since females that are
seeking shelter only are unaffected by the reproductive consequences of their responses to male
courtship these response must be maintained and expressed by these females for other reasons.
The authors argue that females not seeking mates nevertheless respond to courting males because
this reduces their risk of predation and stress from heat and desiccation as they search for a new
burrow and territory. This is well supported by other work, primarily by myself and the third
author. Since there is complete overlap in both the ecological and social contexts females
experience when seeking mates and when seeking territories, this result also implies that one
need not invoke reproductive benefits to explain why receptive females respond as they do to
courtship. Direct ecological benefits are sufficient whether or not reproductive benefits also are
involved. This is a radical view but one I believe is well supported by the evidence. Now to the
problems.
The study species Uca mjoebergi, belongs to a group of 4- 5 “sister” species with very similar
reproductive biology. Very thorough studies of sister species (Yammaguchi 1971, 2001; Murai et
al. 1987; Nakasone and Murai 1998) have shown that there is overlap in the state of sexual
receptivity between resident and wandering females and that resident females often do mate on
the surface and breed alone in their own burrows. Hence the classification of females into
wandering and resident does not correspond to a classification based on sexual receptivity. The
authors clearly recognize this (lines 237 – 246). I think this clarification for the U. mjoebergi
should go up front in the manuscript along with mention of the previous studies showing this to
be the case in the other sister species. At the same time the authors should bring in any additional
information they may have on surface mating in U. mjoebergi. In short put this study in context
with what is known about mating and sexual receptivity in other closely related species.
There also have been several studies by me and by me and the third author on the responses by
receptive and non-receptive females to courting males and their burrows, to empty burrows and
to occupied burrows but with the male not on the surface courting. These include Christy 1983 on
Uca pugilator (30 receptive and 33 non-receptive females), Christy 1988 on Uca beebei (23
receptive and 53 non-receptive females) and Christy et al. 2002 on Uca terpsichores (28 receptive
and 34 non-receptive females.) [Please check, (e.g., Kim, deRivera and etc.) there may be other
studies wherein the authors have visually tracked the movement of females as they seek borrow
or mates.] The results of these other studies generally are consistent with the present study but
include in Uca beebei greater aggression by males with pillars to non-receptive females and
perhaps as a consequence lower rates of approach by non-receptive females to these males. I
urge the authors to cite, summarize and integrate the results of these previous studies into this
report. It would strengthen their case by showing their view likely extends to other distantly-
related species in the genus.
4
As I show by comparing passages below, at least some of the concepts, interpretation and even
language in this paper correspond closely to those I published almost a decade ago (Christy
2007). This is not surprising because my views, in part, grew out of research the third author and
I did together over several years, particularly Christy et al. 2002. Still, Christy (2007) should be
cited, but was not.
The authors set out two alternative explanations for why females that are not seeking mates may
respond to male courtship as do females seeking mates. I quote (numbers reference lines)
47 “First, females may behave deceptively, mimicking a mate-searching female in order to gain a
non-mating advantage.”
54 “Second, females may appear to be mate-searching because the same sensory biases function
in the contexts of mating as well as foraging or searching for a new territory (sensory drive [4])”
The two reasons are not alternatives. The second relates to the behavioral mechanisms that
constitute (produce) the deceptive behavior, not to whether deception exists. A false positive
(non-receptive female behaving as a receptive females) is deceptive whether it is based on
sensory biases or on responses that are selected and evolve only because they yield benefits from
deceiving others (a very unlikely situation).
The distinction then might be between the origin and nature of selection that generates the
responses that deceive, not between deceptive behaviors on the one hand and sensory biases on
the other. If the authors agree then they will need to revise all parts of the report that refer to
these “alternatives.”
Specific comments by line
Abstract – You should tell readers that residents sometimes move from their burrows to find new
ones and that the experiment created this circumstance. Also, the distinction really should be
between receptive and non-receptive females, which itself is something of a continuum. You
show later that some residents when displaced do mate and produce a clutch of eggs.
27 say residents were experimentally made to be wanderers.
43 I suggest saying something like “However, females that are not seeking mates may also move
between and respond to courting males if those males control access to resources (social or
ecological) of value to females whether or not they are seeking mates. In this case females may
employ responses selected because they deceive males into providing them access to these
resources or circumstances (the dance fly and wasp examples). Alternatively the deception may
arise simply because the same sensory biases mediate females’ responses to male courtship both
when they seek mates and when they seek only resources.
I find the water mite example a difficult fit here because this is not a case of males courting both
receptive and non-receptive females and the latter deceiving the male and thereby gaining some
benefit. Now if the female that grasps at food-like male vibrations but is not receptive turns
around and consumes the spermatophores he deposits rather than picking them up and using
the sperm to fertilize her eggs then the case would fit. But Proctor never mentioned that, as far as
I can remember.
62 Put this information after a description of the general biology and behavior. Include
description of surface mating and the circumstances that generate wandering females that had
been residents. Include mention that some wandering residents are sexually receptive and choose
mates.
Also integrate prior studies of the behavior of receptive and non-receptive females of other
species as outlined above.
84 and subsequent. Wander and resident contrast is not what you want. You want to contrast
receptive and non-receptive females. Some residents when made to wander will be receptive.
And some wandering females will be non-receptive.
91 Note that U. beebei males do discriminate; males with pillars give more threats to non-
receptive females than to receptive females and non-receptive females less often approach them.
This is not true of males without pillars and female responses to them.
96 This second prediction does not fit natural history of sister species in which some resident
females that are made to wander do choose mates and breed. Again you need to square the
natural history of this species with that of the sister species.
99 Again this expectation is not consistent with what is known about the sister species.
5
Again please include in the introductory material what is known from other studies of natural
observation of receptive and non-receptive females and their responses to burrows and courting
males. The data are from my studies of Uca pugilator, Uca beebei and Pat and my studies of Uca
terpsichores.
219 “were the same” should be “were not statistically significantly different.”
257 – 262 same results as for Uca pugilator reported 1983.
287 produced eggs or laid eggs
305 Generalize. When a female moves between and interacts successively with courting males we
tend to interpret this behaviour as an indication that she is sexually receptive and looking for a
mate.
319 – 321 not alternatives.
329 Why put ‘resident’ in quotes?
342 This is not an alternative – sensory biases can be the basis of deception. The result is the same
for both males and females.
345 Landmark orientation, the response that mediates the attraction of structures built by
courting males of several species is present in species that do not build structures and in other
genera in the same family. It very likely is basal and that signals that elicit the response have
evolved several times across the genus.
345- 354 This section of text corresponds closely to text from Christy (2007) including the use of
the term “break”
Compare from this manuscript:
Mate-searching females make frequent adjustments to their body orientation so that they keep
their transverse axis aligned with the bearing of the last visited burrow [19]. This enables them to
quickly return to that burrow in a straight line. As the females move further away from the last
visited burrow, there is a point at which they ‘break’ the connection to that burrow: this is visible
as the female abruptly changes her body orientation and her direction of movement to approach
the next male to be visited, following him back to his burrow [19]. It is likely that the U. mjoebergi
females’ territory-seeking behaviours have been co-opted to shape their mate-searching
behaviour (or vice versa). When females are searching for either a new territory or a mate, the
most efficient way to do this may be to move from male to male, always keeping a path map to
the last visited burrow in case of a predatory threat.
With the following passage from Christy (2007)
Why do females preferentially move to hoods when they leave one burrow and go to the next?
Sexually receptive and nonreceptive female U. terpsichores both preferentially approach males
with hoods (Christy et al. 2002), suggesting that they use the same orientation mechanisms. As
they leave one male’s burrow and move to the next, females must abandon their path maps and
move on. This sometimes is clearly evident in a “break” in the transverse orientation of the
female toward the burrow she is leaving. At this point, the female quickly moves to the next
burrow by either following a male or moving to a hood. The results of several experiments with
and without model predators support the hypothesis that hoods elicit landmark orientation
(Christy 1995, Christy et al. 2003a, 2003b). The most telling experiments showed that receptive
and nonreceptive females, when not given burrows, moved spontaneously to hoods (replicas),
shells, stones, and pieces of wood. We added these objects to courting males’ burrows and found
that receptive females did not prefer hoods over the other natural objects that are common on the
beach (Christy et al. 2003b)
In fact, the section “Antipredator Behavior Biases Signal Evolution” in Christy (2007) laid out
many elements that are used in the argument developed in this paper. This, no doubt, reflects the
close association between Backwell and myself over several years as we explored together how
landmark orientation mediates mate choice in Uca terpsichores. However please do cite my
overview chapter from 2007.
365 Yes, but this does not mean that their behavior is not deceptive from the male’s point of view.
370 As shown also comparing receptive and non-receptive wandering females in Uca pugilator
(Christy 1983) and Uca beebei (Christy 1988). Cite this work please.
390 Yes, and you see this because of total overlap in the selective contexts of searching for a mate
and searching for a territory.
6
400 and subsequent – conclusions. There is even something more fundamental going on here I
think. We are looking at how females respond to courtship signals as their state of sexually
receptivity ranges from one extreme to the other and find no difference in the responses. This
implies that reproductive benefits of mating males that use particular signals need not be invoked
to explain the evolution of the responses. Instead the benefits may be direct and derived from
“ecological selection” rather than ‘social selection.” This is an extremely radical view of the
evolution of preference, at least to those who think that sensory biases and sensory drive are only
generative in animal communication and largely historical “blips” that get swept up by other
modes of selection, but perhaps one worth putting out there.

Comments to the Author(s)
The ms by Peso et al is generally a solid behavioural analysis of female movement in a fiddler
crab. The study is well designed, although may suffer a little bit from slightly low sample size (a
general problem in these types of studies where the work can be quite difficult and time
consuming). I don't believe the sample size is a major issue, but it does raise a question of power
at one or two points (as mentioned below).
Lines 216-220 vs Lines 243-246. This is the exact same contrast, reported twice (14/32 vs 7/27), yet
using a slightly different statistical test. Why report this outcome twice?
Related to the previous comment, given the relatively small sample sizes, I'd be curious about a
basic power analysis: how large a difference would there need to be in order for you to find a
difference? Apparently 44% and 26% (which "feel" rather different) are not significantly different
at this sample size. What would be?
Minor comments:
lines 40-41: the list of negative outcomes of mate searching is a little specific to fiddler crabs, even
though they haven't been mentioned in the text yet.
Line 50-52: "In the wasp..." While an interesting factoid, this sentence has nothing to do with the
primary thrust of the paragraph, which is about female searching, not male's pretending to be
females.
Line 77: "...if she selects to mate..." I believe "selects" should be "elects"
Lines 270-277: given that it has been famously reported in the past that males will wave at just
about anything vaguely fiddler sized moving around the surface (clawless males, females from
other species, spools of thread, etc.), the fact that they didn't distinguishing between wandering
and resident females of the correct species is hardly a surprise. In fact, I would have been more
surprised if they had reacted differently.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper shows that there is very little difference between the responses that females of a
species of fiddler crab make to courting males when those females are sexually receptive and
seeking mates and when they are not receptive (do not choose a mate) but are seeking burrows
for shelter. Although there are some problems with the report (less so with the study per se) this
is a very important result. It challenges the nearly universal assumption that female responses to
male courtship signals and displays evolve as a consequence of the fitness effects of mating and
breeding with males that use certain signals and displays and not others. Since females that are
seeking shelter only are unaffected by the reproductive consequences of their responses to male
courtship these response must be maintained and expressed by these females for other reasons.
The authors argue that females not seeking mates nevertheless respond to courting males because
this reduces their risk of predation and stress from heat and desiccation as they search for a new
burrow and territory. This is well supported by other work, primarily by myself and the third
author. Since there is complete overlap in both the ecological and social contexts females
experience when seeking mates and when seeking territories, this result also implies that one
9
need not invoke reproductive benefits to explain why receptive females respond as they do to
courtship. Direct ecological benefits are sufficient whether or not reproductive benefits also are
involved. This is a radical view but one I believe is well supported by the evidence. Now to the
problems.
The study species Uca mjoebergi, belongs to a group of 4- 5 “sister” species with very similar
reproductive biology. Very thorough studies of sister species (Yammaguchi 1971, 2001; Murai et
al. 1987; Nakasone and Murai 1998) have shown that there is overlap in the state of sexual
receptivity between resident and wandering females and that resident females often do mate on
the surface and breed alone in their own burrows. Hence the classification of females into
wandering and resident does not correspond to a classification based on sexual receptivity. The
authors clearly recognize this (lines 237 – 246). I think this clarification for the U. mjoebergi
should go up front in the manuscript along with mention of the previous studies showing this to
be the case in the other sister species. At the same time the authors should bring in any additional
information they may have on surface mating in U. mjoebergi. In short put this study in context
with what is known about mating and sexual receptivity in other closely related species.
There also have been several studies by me and by me and the third author on the responses by
receptive and non-receptive females to courting males and their burrows, to empty burrows and
to occupied burrows but with the male not on the surface courting. These include Christy 1983 on
Uca pugilator (30 receptive and 33 non-receptive females), Christy 1988 on Uca beebei (23
receptive and 53 non-receptive females) and Christy et al. 2002 on Uca terpsichores (28 receptive
and 34 non-receptive females.) [Please check, (e.g., Kim, deRivera and etc.) there may be other
studies wherein the authors have visually tracked the movement of females as they seek borrow
or mates.] The results of these other studies generally are consistent with the present study but
include in Uca beebei greater aggression by males with pillars to non-receptive females and
perhaps as a consequence lower rates of approach by non-receptive females to these males. I
urge the authors to cite, summarize and integrate the results of these previous studies into this
report. It would strengthen their case by showing their view likely extends to other distantly-
related species in the genus.
As I show by comparing passages below, at least some of the concepts, interpretation and even
language in this paper correspond closely to those I published almost a decade ago (Christy
2007). This is not surprising because my views, in part, grew out of research the third author and
I did together over several years, particularly Christy et al. 2002. Still, Christy (2007) should be
cited, but was not.
The authors set out two alternative explanations for why females that are not seeking mates may
respond to male courtship as do females seeking mates. I quote (numbers reference lines)
47 “First, females may behave deceptively, mimicking a mate-searching female in order to gain a
non-mating advantage.”
54 “Second, females may appear to be mate-searching because the same sensory biases function
in the contexts of mating as well as foraging or searching for a new territory (sensory drive [4])”
The two reasons are not alternatives. The second relates to the behavioral mechanisms that
constitute (produce) the deceptive behavior, not to whether deception exists. A false positive
(non-receptive female behaving as a receptive females) is deceptive whether it is based on
sensory biases or on responses that are selected and evolve only because they yield benefits from
deceiving others (a very unlikely situation).
The distinction then might be between the origin and nature of selection that generates the
responses that deceive, not between deceptive behaviors on the one hand and sensory biases on
the other. If the authors agree then they will need to revise all parts of the report that refer to
these “alternatives.”
Specific comments by line
Abstract – You should tell readers that residents sometimes move from their burrows to find new
ones and that the experiment created this circumstance. Also, the distinction really should be
between receptive and non-receptive females, which itself is something of a continuum. You
show later that some residents when displaced do mate and produce a clutch of eggs.
27 say residents were experimentally made to be wanderers.

43 I suggest saying something like “However, females that are not seeking mates may also move
between and respond to courting males if those males control access to resources (social or
ecological) of value to females whether or not they are seeking mates. In this case females may
employ responses selected because they deceive males into providing them access to these

I can remember.
62 Put this information after a description of the general biology and behavior. Include
description of surface mating and the circumstances that generate wandering females that had
been residents. Include mention that some wandering residents are sexually receptive and choose
mates.
Also integrate prior studies of the behavior of receptive and non-receptive females of other
species as outlined above.
84 and subsequent. Wander and resident contrast is not what you want. You want to contrast
receptive and non-receptive females. Some residents when made to wander will be receptive.
And some wandering females will be non-receptive.
91 Note that U. beebei males do discriminate; males with pillars give more threats to non-
receptive females than to receptive females and non-receptive females less often approach them.
This is not true of males without pillars and female responses to them.
96 This second prediction does not fit natural history of sister species in which some resident
females that are made to wander do choose mates and breed. Again you need to square the
natural history of this species with that of the sister species.
99 Again this expectation is not consistent with what is known about the sister species.
Again please include in the introductory material what is known from other studies of natural
observation of receptive and non-receptive females and their responses to burrows and courting
males. The data are from my studies of Uca pugilator, Uca beebei and Pat and my studies of Uca

257 – 262 same results as for Uca pugilator reported 1983.
287 produced eggs or laid eggs
305 Generalize. When a female moves between and interacts successively with courting males we
tend to interpret this behaviour as an indication that she is sexually receptive and looking for a
mate.
319 – 321 not alternatives.
329 Why put ‘resident’ in quotes?
342 This is not an alternative – sensory biases can be the basis of deception. The result is the same
for both males and females.
345 Landmark orientation, the response that mediates the attraction of structures built by
courting males of several species is present in species that do not build structures and in other
genera in the same family. It very likely is basal and that signals that elicit the response have
evolved several times across the genus.

females’ territory-seeking behaviours have been co-opted to shape their mate-searching
behaviour (or vice versa). When females are searching for either a new territory or a mate, the
most efficient way to do this may be to move from male to male, always keeping a path map to
the last visited burrow in case of a predatory threat.
With the following passage from Christy (2007)
Why do females preferentially move to hoods when they leave one burrow and go to the next?
Sexually receptive and nonreceptive female U. terpsichores both preferentially approach males
with hoods (Christy et al. 2002), suggesting that they use the same orientation mechanisms. As
they leave one male’s burrow and move to the next, females must abandon their path maps and
move on. This sometimes is clearly evident in a “break” in the transverse orientation of the
female toward the burrow she is leaving. At this point, the female quickly moves to the next
burrow by either following a male or moving to a hood. The results of several experiments with
and without model predators support the hypothesis that hoods elicit landmark orientation
(Christy 1995, Christy et al. 2003a, 2003b). The most telling experiments showed that receptive
and nonreceptive females, when not given burrows, moved spontaneously to hoods (replicas),
shells, stones, and pieces of wood. We added these objects to courting males’ burrows and found
that receptive females did not prefer hoods over the other natural objects that are common on the
beach (Christy et al. 2003b)
In fact, the section “Antipredator Behavior Biases Signal Evolution” in Christy (2007) laid out
many elements that are used in the argument developed in this paper. This, no doubt, reflects the
close association between Backwell and myself over several years as we explored together how
landmark orientation mediates mate choice in Uca terpsichores. However please do cite my
overview chapter from 2007.
365 Yes, but this does not mean that their behavior is not deceptive from the male’s point of view.
370 As shown also comparing receptive and non-receptive wandering females in Uca pugilator
(Christy 1983) and Uca beebei (Christy 1988). Cite this work please.
390 Yes, and you see this because of total overlap in the selective contexts of searching for a mate
and searching for a territory.
400 and subsequent – conclusions. There is even something more fundamental going on here I
think. We are looking at how females respond to courtship signals as their state of sexually
receptivity ranges from one extreme to the other and find no difference in the responses. This
implies that reproductive benefits of mating males that use particular signals need not be invoked
to explain the evolution of the responses. Instead the benefits may be direct and derived from
“ecological selection” rather than ‘social selection.” This is an extremely radical view of the
evolution of preference, at least to those who think that sensory biases and sensory drive are only
generative in animal communication and largely historical “blips” that get swept up by other
modes of selection, but perhaps one worth putting out there.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The authors have, in their own words “taken onboard” most of the changes I recommended in
my previous review and I thank them for that. We still differ in how to recognize a sexually
receptive and a sexually non-receptive female and hence in how to observe behavior that leads to
mate choice from behavior that does not lead to mate choice. I would contend that the best way is
post-hoc; watch a female to see if she chooses a mate and, if possible, determine whether she
subsequently produces a clutch of eggs. The result is records of the behavior of mated and un-
mated females. The authors chose to examine the behavior of females that were wandering on the
surface (44%, 14/32, chose a mate) and females that were residents and made to wander (26%,
7/27, chose a mate, rates not statistically different). They explain
“In these studies (referring to previous studies by me and me and the third author), females are
categorised as receptive and non-receptive based on whether or not they settle with a male at the
end of a trial and these categories must be determined post hoc. Our questions primarily concern
the investigation of behaviours that we associate with mate-searching and how we define mate-
searching behaviour. To do this, we had to define the categories of females based on their
behaviour at the time of capture (wandering the mudflat or residing at a burrow).
Taking my recommended approach, the behavior a female exhibits before she chooses a mate
constitutes (by definition) mate searching behavior. I don’t understand how “defining the
categories of females based on their behaviour at the time of capture” aids in studying mate
searching behavior; females in both categories, wandering on the mud flat and resident at a
burrow when captured, include some that will and some that will not choose a mate and produce
a clutch of eggs (as shown nicely by this study). Hence some females in each category will exhibit
mate searching behavior and some will not. One only knows after they do or do not choose a
mate. Which takes us back to the post-hoc determination.
Fortunately, the inclusion of both receptive (mated) and non-receptive (un-mated) females in
samples of females that were wandering and were resident at a burrow at the time of capture
does not substantially change the overall conclusions that can be drawn from the study. The
relative proportions of the two classes of females were roughly similar in the two categories
(status when captured) of females. The MANOVA showed no differences in behavior between
wanderer and resident females but that mated (receptive) female visited more courting males and
fewer unguarded burrows compared to un-mated (non-receptive) females; a difference also
found in some past studies.
Less fortunately, in my opinion, the presence of both receptive and non-receptive females in the
two categories of females, “wanderer” and “resident,” makes for somewhat confusing
presentation, at least for the non-fiddler crab specialist. Folks will “buy” the idea that resident
females that are caught and released or that are naturally expelled from their burrows by
intruders will be (“presumably”) non-receptive and will be looking for burrows (new territories),
not for mates, and vice versa for wandering females, and this is not entirely correct. Only after
13
reading the MANOVA results will it be clear that females that are and that are not seeking mates
occur in both categories. The authors are not obfuscating, indeed they face the ambiguity straight
on, but it still will be confusing for many readers.
Page 22, line 52 – 56 the authors state
In U. mjoebergi, females surface mate with neighbours in exchange for help with territory
defense and then wander to choose a mate (Slatyer et al. 2012). (This has been added to the
manuscript: lines 74-77). It is a reasonable hypothesis to postulate that females that are wandering
in order to search for a ‘true’ mate would be likely to produce a clutch of eggs than resident
females. Existing data on sister species refers only to mating receptivity, not on whether or not
this receptivity results in offspring.
Yet, on line 71 – 72 of the revised manuscript the authors state that female Uca lactea, Uca
perplexa (and I added Uca beebei) that mate on the surface with neighboring males do produce a
clutch in their own burrow without then seeking another “true” mate. The apparent difference
between these other species, especially the very closely related Uca lactea and Uca perplexa and
Uca mjoebergi seems odd. Why would male Uca mjoebergi mate on the surface with neighboring
females and then defend them if these females always then leave their burrows and mate with
other males (“true” mates) that father all or almost all the young? Seems like selection would
eliminate that unproductive male behavior fairly quickly.
(I assume that the first version of the ms in the pdf is the revised version and I have used that one
as the basis for the following comments. The second complete copy of the ms at the end of the pdf
appears to be a copy of the first version in this document. Both differ from the original
manuscript.)
Specific comments and suggested changes by line
27 “…and we simulated this by catching and releasing residents away from their burrows and
observing their behavior as they wandered.”
28 “We predicted that wanderer, which we also caught and released, would exhibit…”
43 “…moving sequentially between males…”
49-50 “non-reproductive females may behave as they do when seeking mates and thereby deceive
males into allowing them access to male-defended resources.
52 – 53 Omit “Non-reproductive females may also mimic the behaviour of mate-searchers to gain
access to a male’s territory (and associated resources).” Repeats sentence above.
54 – 57 replace with “The responses of sexually receptive and non-receptive females to male
courtship may not differ because the same sensory biases mediate female behavior in both
contexts.”
The Sensory drive (Endler 1992) hypothesis proposes that properties of the sensory systems of
receivers that evolved due to selection in diverse ecological and social contexts largely determine
what traits and trait values of signalers will be favored by social selection and evolve. The
reference to sensory drive here is not appropriate because you are talking about how sensory
biases shape responses to males not how these biases shape (drive) the signals males use to
attract females.
64 omit “can and do”
66 – 70 Territory-holding females who leave their burrows or are displaced from them by other
crabs also need to acquire new burrows, most of which are held by males. Such females wander,
approach and visit courting males as they seek a new burrow (list of species in [4]).
71 – 72 “… and incubate in their own burrow (e.g. Uca lacteal (refs), Uca perplexa (refs) and Uca
beebei (Christy 1998)). Other females will leave their burrows to search for a mate.”
14
The notion of a “true” wanderer is not helpful, although I know what you mean – a wandering
sexually receptive female that will stop wandering by choosing a mate. You might say that these
other females have mature ovaries (evidence in Yamaguchi 2001 and Murai et al. 1997), are
sexually receptive, and look for and finally choose a mate.
79 – 85 “presumably non-receptive” As the study shows, this presumption is wrong; some
evicted or displace females are receptive. Your working assumption - that receptivity is a
property of the category of female – wandering or resident - is not correct as shown by previous
studies of other species of Uca.
101 “…prior to capture. We do not know…”
277 – 281 The responses of mated and non-mated Uca mjoebergi compare favorably with the
responses of receptive and non-receptive Uca pugilator (Christy 1983) and Uca beebei (Christy
1987).
306 Females don’t “release” eggs. In fact they are very careful to retain them so that they adhere
to the setae on their pleopods. Please say “produced a clutch of eggs” or similar.
344 These anthropomorphic terms are inappropriate. We cannot know whether crabs believe
anything. How about something a bit more agnostic like “The benefits of having access to a
burrow may favor females that exhibit the same responses to male courtship whether or not they
are seeking mates. In this way non-receptive females may deceive males into allowing them to
approach and enter their burrows as males do for receptive females.”
367 and forward “responses” may be better than “sensory biases” in this argument. We observe
what females do – how they respond to male courtship and hence an emphasis on responses may
be best.
389 – The behaviors of these females are not shaped by a sensory trap. A sensory trap occurs
when an animal makes a response to some stimuli as if these stimuli were something they are
not. Females are not caught in a sensory trap when they respond to courting males and burrows.
If there is a sensory trap here, a form of deception it is worked on males not females. Both
sexually receptive and non-receptive females respond in the same way to males and males
therefor are deceived by the non-receptive females into granting them access to their burrows as
if they were receptive females. Please recast this sentence to remove the incorrect use of “sensory
trap.”
389 – 391 This argument is backward. Females are approaching males and burrows whether or
not they (the females) are receptive because they benefit directly from doing so – this reduces
their risk while moving on the surface searching either for a mate and breeding site or a burrow
and new territory. Females are not being deceived by the males. Failure to receive possible
benefits from mating with the courting male is not a cost when the females is not seeking a mate.
Contrary to the statement here females not seeking mates should respond to courtship and in just
the same way (nearly so) as they do when seeking mates as this study shows. There is no
selection against responding in the same way to courtship whether or not the female is seeking a
mate.
394 Yes – this is the key point I think. Mate searching occurs in ecological time and space and
there is total contextual overlap between seeking a mate and seeking a new burrow and location
on the mudflat. This has led to selection on females to respond in the same manner to courtship
whether or not they will mate with the males in the burrows they visit.
414 – omit “First” because there is no second or third.… reasons listed.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The ms by Peso et al is generally a solid behavioural analysis of female movement in a fiddler crab.
The study is well designed, although may suffer a little bit from slightly low sample size (a general
problem in these types of studies where the work can be quite difficult and time consuming). I don't
believe the sample size is a major issue, but it does raise a question of power at one or two points (as
mentioned below).
Lines 216-220 vs Lines 243-246. This is the exact same contrast, reported twice (14/32 vs 7/27), yet
using a slightly different statistical test. Why report this outcome twice?
We apologise for this error. This was an oversight from an earlier version of the manuscript. We have
removed one of the mentions of this outcome. This section now reads:
“Wandering and resident females did not differ in the way they secured new burrows. No female dug a
new burrow; most females occupied empty burrows (wanderers: 56%, 18/32; residents: 74%, 20/27);
and fewer females stayed with a male after entering his burrow (wanderers: 44%, 14/32; residents:
26%, 7/27). The proportion of wanderers and residents that mated were not statistically significantly
different from each other (14/32; 7/27; Fisher’s Exact Test P = 0.18).” (lines 236-240)
Related to the previous comment, given the relatively small sample sizes, I'd be curious about a basic
power analysis: how large a difference would there need to be in order for you to find a difference?
Apparently 44% and 26% (which "feel" rather different) are not significantly different at this sample
size. What would be?
We have conducted this power analysis and reported it in the Discussion. It has been described like
this:
“In our study, the males allowed burrow access to all females equally (wanderers: 44%, 14/32;
residents: 26%, 7/27). Although our sample sizes were modest, we should have been able to detect a
large effect (power analysis for an effect size of 0.9 at a = 0.05 and n = 32; the power would be
0.95).” (lines 348-350)
Minor comments:
lines 40-41: the list of negative outcomes of mate searching is a little specific to fiddler crabs, even
though they haven't been mentioned in the text yet.
Although fiddler crabs provide striking examples of females who visit and reject several males before
choosing a mate, they are not unique in doing this. In lekking species across taxa, it is commonplace
for several potential mates to be visited and rejected.
Line 50-52: "In the wasp..." While an interesting factoid, this sentence has nothing to do with the
primary thrust of the paragraph, which is about female searching, not male's pretending to be females.
We have removed this example.
Line 77: "...if she selects to mate..." I believe "selects" should be "elects"
Thanks for that. We have corrected this error.
Lines 270-277: given that it has been famously reported in the past that males will wave at just about
anything vaguely fiddler sized moving around the surface (clawless males, females from other
species, spools of thread, etc.), the fact that they didn't distinguishing between wandering and resident
females of the correct species is hardly a surprise. In fact, I would have been more surprised if they
had reacted differently.
The males are indeed motivated courters but it is reasonable to hypothesise that there might be
selection pressure on males to detect females that have no intention of mating. In fact, males with
pillars do behave aggressively to non-receptive females in U. beebei (Christy 1998). We have added
this information to the introduction so that it is clearer. It now reads:
“We observed the behaviour of the males the wanderers and residents visited to determine whether
males could discriminate between these female types (as they do in a pillar-building sister species, U.
beebei [1]).” (lines 104-106)

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper shows that there is very little difference between the responses that females of a species of
fiddler crab make to courting males when those females are sexually receptive and seeking mates and
when they are not receptive (do not choose a mate) but are seeking burrows for shelter. Although
there are some problems with the report (less so with the study per se) this is a very important result. It
challenges the nearly universal assumption that female responses to male courtship signals and
displays evolve as a consequence of the fitness effects of mating and breeding with males that use
certain signals and displays and not others. Since females that are seeking shelter only are unaffected
by the reproductive consequences of their responses to male courtship these response must be
maintained and expressed by these females for other reasons. The authors argue that females not
seeking mates nevertheless respond to courting males because this reduces their risk of predation and
stress from heat and desiccation as they search for a new burrow and territory. This is well supported
by other work, primarily by myself and the third author. Since there is complete overlap in both the
ecological and social contexts females experience when seeking mates and when seeking territories,
this result also implies that one need not invoke reproductive benefits to explain why receptive
females respond as they do to courtship. Direct ecological benefits are sufficient whether or not
reproductive benefits also are involved. This is a radical view but one I believe is well supported by
the evidence. Now to the problems.
The study species Uca mjoebergi, belongs to a group of 4- 5 “sister” species with very similar
reproductive biology. Very thorough studies of sister species (Yammaguchi 1971, 2001; Murai et al.
1987; Nakasone and Murai 1998) have shown that there is overlap in the state of sexual receptivity
between resident and wandering females and that resident females often do mate on the surface and
breed alone in their own burrows. Hence the classification of females into wandering and resident
does not correspond to a classification based on sexual receptivity. The authors clearly recognize this
(lines 237 – 246). I think this clarification for the U. mjoebergi should go up front in the manuscript
along with mention of the previous studies showing this to be the case in the other sister species. At
the same time the authors should bring in any additional information they may have on surface mating
in U. mjoebergi. In short put this study in context with what is known about mating and sexual
receptivity in other closely related species.
We have fully taken on board your suggestions and have woven in studies on the natural history of
these sister species throughout the manuscript. We have included a section up front in the manuscript
as a clarification. It reads:
“Fiddler crabs provide a unique opportunity to study female behaviour in situations where males are
both potential mates and holders of vital territories. Fiddler crab territories contain a central burrow
that is used as a water source, a mating and incubation site, a heat sink, and a refuge from predators.
Some females wander amongst the males, visiting males by approaching them and putting their feet
into his burrow entrance. Females can and do visit and reject several males before choosing a mate,
searching for up to an hour [2]. On some visits, the female briefly enters the burrow and stays if she
elects to mate with the male, or leaves if she does not choose to mate. Territory-holding females
displaced from their territories by other crabs also need to acquire new burrows, most of which are
held by males. Other non-receptive females in this genus (Uca), will leave their territories and
‘become’ wanderers, perhaps to avoid aggressive neighbours and/or to look for food at a new burrow
(list of species in [2]). In some Uca species, territory-holding females will mate on the surface and
incubate in their own burrows (e.g. U. lactea [3, 4] and U. perplexa [5]). Other females will leave
their burrows to become ‘true’ wanderers that are searching for a mate. Taken together, these points
indicate that wandering and territory-holding are not necessarily direct equivalents of receptivity and
non-receptivity in females of these species. In the banana fiddler crab, Uca mjoebergi, females will
surface mate with neighbours in exchange for help in territory defense but leave their territories to
burrow mate, where the last male sires most of the offspring [6], perhaps indicating a stronger
association between wandering and receptivity in this species.” (lines 60-77)
There also have been several studies by me and by me and the third author on the responses by
receptive and non-receptive females to courting males and their burrows, to empty burrows and to
occupied burrows but with the male not on the surface courting. These include Christy 1983 on Uca
pugilator (30 receptive and 33 non-receptive females), Christy 1988 on Uca beebei (23 receptive and
53 non-receptive females) and Christy et al. 2002 on Uca terpsichores (28 receptive and 34 non-
receptive females.) [Please check, (e.g., Kim, deRivera and etc.) there may be other studies wherein
the authors have visually tracked the movement of females as they seek borrow or mates.] The results
of these other studies generally are consistent with the present study but include in Uca beebei greater
aggression by males with pillars to non-receptive females and perhaps as a consequence lower rates of
approach by non-receptive females to these males. I urge the authors to cite, summarize and integrate
the results of these previous studies into this report. It would strengthen their case by showing their
view likely extends to other distantly-related species in the genus.
In these studies, females are categorised as receptive and non-receptive based on whether or not they
settle with a male at the end of a trial and these categories must be determined post hoc. Our questions
primarily concern the investigation of behaviours that we associate with mate-searching and how we
define mate-searching behaviour. To do this, we had to define the categories of females based on their
behaviour at the time of capture (wandering the mudflat or residing at a burrow). While we
acknowledge these are imperfect categories, we have gone a step further in our investigation of our
data examining the behaviour of females that mated (receptive in prior studies) and those that did not
(non-receptive in prior studies). We also took the studies a step further by examining whether the
female had a clutch of eggs- a more definitive assessment of receptivity. We have included these
studies in our manuscript, but reference them in our discussions of mated and unmated females. The
following is an example, but you will find many of these references throughout the manuscript:
“The only behavioural differences we could detect were not between wanderers and residents, but
between females that ended up in a burrow with a male at the end of the trial (mated) and females that
did not. Females that eventually mated visited more males and fewer unguarded burrows, consistent
with results reported for two related species, U. pugliator [7] and U. beebei [1]. A study in a third
species, U. terpsichores (formerly U. musica), showed that receptive females (females that mated)
visited more males than non-receptive females [8].” (lines 396-401)
As I show by comparing passages below, at least some of the concepts, interpretation and even
language in this paper correspond closely to those I published almost a decade ago (Christy 2007).
This is not surprising because my views, in part, grew out of research the third author and I did
together over several years, particularly Christy et al. 2002. Still, Christy (2007) should be cited, but
was not.
Our apologies for not citing this manuscript. Even searching directly for it, it was difficult to access.
In the end, I found it on your ResearchGate profile and wasn’t able to access it in any other way.
The authors set out two alternative explanations for why females that are not seeking mates may
respond to male courtship as do females seeking mates. I quote (numbers reference lines)
47 “First, females may behave deceptively, mimicking a mate-searching female in order to gain a non-
mating advantage.”
54 “Second, females may appear to be mate-searching because the same sensory biases function in the
contexts of mating as well as foraging or searching for a new territory (sensory drive [4])”
The two reasons are not alternatives. The second relates to the behavioral mechanisms that constitute
(produce) the deceptive behavior, not to whether deception exists. A false positive (non-receptive
female behaving as a receptive females) is deceptive whether it is based on sensory biases or on
responses that are selected and evolve only because they yield benefits from deceiving others (a very
unlikely situation).
The distinction then might be between the origin and nature of selection that generates the responses
that deceive, not between deceptive behaviors on the one hand and sensory biases on the other. If the
authors agree then they will need to revise all parts of the report that refer to these “alternatives.”
Thanks for clarifying this distinction. This has been corrected throughout the manuscript. Here is part
of the revised Introduction:
“To obtain male-held resources, non-reproductive females may behave dishonestly, mimicking a
mate-searching female to deceive the males into granting their resources. In the dance fly, non-
receptive females inflate their abdominal pouches in order to mimic egg-carrying females and thereby
cause males to give them nuptial gifts [9]. Non-reproductive females may also mimic the behaviour of
mate-searchers to gain access to a male’s territory (and associated resources). Females’ sensory biases
could shape behavioural responses to males, whether they are seeking a mate or the resources they
hold (sensory drive [10]). If this is true, non-mate-searching females may appear to be mate-searching
because the behavioural and sensory biases that are used when selecting a mate are the same as the
biases used when searching for a territory. This is especially true where territories/refuges are held by
males and of limited supply.” (lines 49-58)
Specific comments by line
Abstract – You should tell readers that residents sometimes move from their burrows to find new ones
and that the experiment created this circumstance. Also, the distinction really should be between
receptive and non-receptive females, which itself is something of a continuum. You show later that
some residents when displaced do mate and produce a clutch of eggs.
27 say residents were experimentally made to be wanderers.
Thank you, we have taken this into account. The following is the revised abstract:
“Risks inherent in mate-searching have led to the assumption that females moving sequentially through
populations of courting males are receptive and ready to mate, but this may not be true. We examined
two types of fiddler crab females: wanderers moving through the population of courting males and
residents that were occupying and defending their own territories. Sometimes residents leave territories
to look for new burrows and we simulated this by displacing wanderers and residents and observing
their behaviour. We hypothesised that wanderers would exhibit more mate-searching behaviours than
resident females. However, wandering and resident females behaved nearly identically, displaying
mate-searching behaviours and demonstrating matching mate preferences. Also, males behaved the
same way towards both female types and similar proportions of wanderers and residents stayed in a
male’s burrow to mate. But more wanderers than residents produced egg clutches when choosing a
burrow containing a male, suggesting females should be categorised as receptive and non-receptive.
Visiting and rejecting several males is not the defining feature of female mate choice. Moving across
the mudflat by approaching and leaving a succession of burrows (mostly occupied by males) is an
adaptive anti-predator behaviour that is useful in the contexts of mate-searching and territory-
searching.”
43 I suggest saying something like “However, females that are not seeking mates may also move
between and respond to courting males if those males control access to resources (social or ecological)
of value to females whether or not they are seeking mates. In this case females may employ responses
selected because they deceive males into providing them access to these resources or circumstances
(the dance fly and wasp examples). Alternatively the deception may arise simply because the same
sensory biases mediate females’ responses to male courtship both when they seek mates and when
they seek only resources.
We have changed this section. It now reads:
“To obtain male-held resources, non-reproductive females may behave dishonestly, mimicking a
mate-searching female to deceive the males into granting their resources. In the dance fly, non-
receptive females inflate their abdominal pouches in order to mimic egg-carrying females and thereby
cause males to give them nuptial gifts [9]. Non-reproductive females may also mimic the behaviour of
mate-searchers to gain access to a male’s territory (and associated resources). Females’ sensory biases
could shape behavioural responses to males, whether they are seeking a mate or the resources they
hold (sensory drive [10]). If this is true, non-mate-searching females may appear to be mate-searching
because the behavioural and sensory biases that are used when selecting a mate are the same as the
biases used when searching for a territory. This is especially true where territories/refuges are held by
males and of limited supply.” (lines 49-58)
I find the water mite example a difficult fit here because this is not a case of males courting both
receptive and non-receptive females and the latter deceiving the male and thereby gaining some
benefit. Now if the female that grasps at food-like male vibrations but is not receptive turns around
and consumes the spermatophores he deposits rather than picking them up and using the sperm to
fertilize her eggs then the case would fit. But Proctor never mentioned that, as far as I can remember.
We have removed this example.
62 Put this information after a description of the general biology and behavior. Include description of
surface mating and the circumstances that generate wandering females that had been residents.
Include mention that some wandering residents are sexually receptive and choose mates.
Also integrate prior studies of the behavior of receptive and non-receptive females of other species as
outlined above.
We have made these suggested changes. This section now reads:
“Fiddler crabs provide a unique opportunity to study female behaviour in situations where males are
both potential mates and holders of vital territories. Fiddler crab territories contain a central burrow
that is used as a water source, a mating and incubation site, a heat sink, and a refuge from predators.
Some females wander amongst the males, visiting males by approaching them and putting their feet
into his burrow entrance. Females can and do visit and reject several males before choosing a mate,
searching for up to an hour [2]. On some visits, the female briefly enters the burrow and stays if she
elects to mate with the male, or leaves if she does not choose to mate. Territory-holding females
displaced from their territories by other crabs also need to acquire new burrows, most of which are
held by males. Other non-receptive females in this genus (Uca), will leave their territories and
‘become’ wanderers, perhaps to avoid aggressive neighbours and/or to look for food at a new burrow
(list of species in [2]). In some Uca species, territory-holding females will mate on the surface and
incubate in their own burrows (e.g. U. lactea [3, 4] and U. perplexa [5]). Other females will leave
their burrows to become ‘true’ wanderers that are searching for a mate. Taken together, these points
indicate that wandering and territory-holding are not necessarily direct equivalents of receptivity and
non-receptivity in females of these species.” (lines 60-77)
84 and subsequent. Wander and resident contrast is not what you want. You want to contrast receptive
and non-receptive females. Some residents when made to wander will be receptive. And some
wandering females will be non-receptive.
This comment was addressed above.
91 Note that U. beebei males do discriminate; males with pillars give more threats to non-receptive
females than to receptive females and non-receptive females less often approach them. This is not true
of males without pillars and female responses to them.
This point has been added. This part now reads:
“We observed the behaviour of the males the wanderers and residents visited to determine whether
males could discriminate between these female types (as they do in a pillar-building sister species, U.
beebei [1]).” (lines 104-106)
This second prediction does not fit natural history of sister species in which some resident females
that are made to wander do choose mates and breed. Again you need to square the natural history of
this species with that of the sister species.
We understand that the categories wanderer and resident in this species is imperfect, and this is
especially true in the sister species. However, in U. mjoebergi, data show that mate searchers are
wanderers (Slatyer et al. 2012) but not all wanderers are mate searchers. It is reasonable to
hypothesise that we will see a greater number of receptive females amongst the wanderers in this
species. We have softened the language to account for the fuzziness of the categories. This hypothesis
now reads: “Wandering females should be significantly more likely to select a mate and remain
underground with him in his burrow, while resident females that we displace should take up residence
in an empty burrow rather than with a male.” (lines 113-115).
99 Again this expectation is not consistent with what is known about the sister species.
In U. mjoebergi, females surface mate with neighbours in exchange for help with territory defense and
then wander to choose a mate (Slatyer et al. 2012). (This has been added to the manuscript: lines 74-
77). It is a reasonable hypothesis to postulate that females that are wandering in order to search for a
‘true’ mate would be likely to produce a clutch of eggs than resident females. Existing data on sister
species refers only to mating receptivity, not on whether or not this receptivity results in offspring.
Again please include in the introductory material what is known from other studies of natural
observation of receptive and non-receptive females and their responses to burrows and courting males.
The data are from my studies of Uca pugilator, Uca beebei and Pat and my studies of Uca
terpsichores.
These have been included in the discussion in the section discussing mated and unmated females, the
equivalent categories of your receptive and non-receptive females. This section reads:
“The only behavioural differences we could detect were not between wanderers and residents, but
between females that ended up in a burrow with a male at the end of the trial (mated) and females that
did not. Females that eventually mated visited more males and fewer unguarded burrows, consistent
with results reported for two related species, U. pugliator [7] and U. beebei [1]. A study in a third
species U. terpsichores (formerly U. musica) showed that receptive females (females that mated)
visited more males than non-receptive females [8].” (lines 396-401)
219 “were the same” should be “were not statistically significantly different.”
This has been corrected.
257 – 262 same results as for Uca pugilator reported 1983.
We have reported this result in the discussion (excerpt from that section two comments above).
287 produced eggs or laid eggs
This has been changed.
305 Generalize. When a female moves between and interacts successively with courting males we
tend to interpret this behaviour as an indication that she is sexually receptive and looking for a mate.
This has been changed so that it is more general.
319 – 321 not alternatives.
This section has been rewritten to reflect that these are not alternatives. It now reads:
“We suggested that females could be deceiving males in order to gain a resource. Consistent with our
data, the female’s sensory biases could have shaped their behaviour, causing them to move through
the population in the same way, whether they are searching for a mate or for some other resource.”
(lines 338-340)
29 Why put ‘resident’ in quotes?
We have removed these quotes.
342 This is not an alternative – sensory biases can be the basis of deception. The result is the same for
both males and females.
This section has been changed to reflect this. It now reads:
“Our data suggest that selection has shaped the behaviour of mate-searching and burrow-searching
females in the same way, co-opting the same sensory biases irrespective of what they are searching for
as the presence of males reliably signal the location of burrows. Either females evolved their biases in
the context of finding a new territory and were later co-opted into the mate-searching context or vice
versa [10].” (lines 368-372)
345 Landmark orientation, the response that mediates the attraction of structures built by courting
males of several species is present in species that do not build structures and in other genera in the
same family. It very likely is basal and that signals that elicit the response have evolved several times
across the genus.
We have taken this into account by referring to how landmark orientation is used in other Uca species:
“Either females evolved their biases in the context of finding a new territory and were later co-opted
into the mate-searching context or vice versa [10]. Data from other Uca species, especially those in
which the courting males build landmarks such as hoods (U. terpsichores) or pillars (U. beebei) beside
their burrows suggest that the females use landmark orientation to navigate across the mudflat [2, 8,
11]. These landmarks provide a place to hide from predators [2, 11-14]. Consistent with this work, we
show that females return to the last-visited burrow when they are threatened by a potential predator,
suggesting that the females move from burrow to burrow in a way that allows them to always have a
path map to a nearby refuge.” (lines 370-378)
345- 354 This section of text corresponds closely to text from Christy (2007) including the use of the
term “break”
Compare from this manuscript:
Mate-searching females make frequent adjustments to their body orientation so that they keep their
transverse axis aligned with the bearing of the last visited burrow [19]. This enables them to quickly
return to that burrow in a straight line. As the females move further away from the last visited burrow,
there is a point at which they ‘break’ the connection to that burrow: this is visible as the female
abruptly changes her body orientation and her direction of movement to approach the next male to be
visited, following him back to his burrow [19]. It is likely that the U. mjoebergi females’ territory-
seeking behaviours have been co-opted to shape their mate-searching behaviour (or vice versa). When
females are searching for either a new territory or a mate, the most efficient way to do this may be to
move from male to male, always keeping a path map to the last visited burrow in case of a predatory
threat.
With the following passage from Christy (2007)
Why do females preferentially move to hoods when they leave one burrow and go to the next?
Sexually receptive and nonreceptive female U. terpsichores both preferentially approach males with
hoods (Christy et al. 2002), suggesting that they use the same orientation mechanisms. As they leave
one male’s burrow and move to the next, females must abandon their path maps and move on. This
sometimes is clearly evident in a “break” in the transverse orientation of the female toward the burrow
she is leaving. At this point, the female quickly moves to the next burrow by either following a male
or moving to a hood. The results of several experiments with and without model predators support the
hypothesis that hoods elicit landmark orientation (Christy 1995, Christy et al. 2003a, 2003b). The
most telling experiments showed that receptive and nonreceptive females, when not given burrows,
moved spontaneously to hoods (replicas), shells, stones, and pieces of wood. We added these objects
to courting males’ burrows and found that receptive females did not prefer hoods over the other
natural objects that are common on the beach (Christy et al. 2003b)
In fact, the section “Antipredator Behavior Biases Signal Evolution” in Christy (2007) laid out many
elements that are used in the argument developed in this paper. This, no doubt, reflects the close
association between Backwell and myself over several years as we explored together how landmark
orientation mediates mate choice in Uca terpsichores. However please do cite my overview chapter
from 2007.
As addressed in the comment above, we have cited your overview chapter and the relevant studies
describing landmark orientation and predators in Uca species.
365 Yes, but this does not mean that their behavior is not deceptive from the male’s point of view.
We have changed this sentence to emphasise your point:
“Here we show that non-mate-searching females preferentially approached large, fast waving males
that produced leading signals. Whilst they are still deceiving the males, this consistent preference for
male traits adds weight to the idea that females’ sensory biases are used in any contexts involving
moving around on the mudflat.” (lines 391-394)
370 As shown also comparing receptive and non-receptive wandering females in Uca pugilator
(Christy 1983) and Uca beebei (Christy 1988). Cite this work please.
These citations have been added:
“The only behavioural differences we could detect were not between wanderers and residents, but
between females that ended up in a burrow with a male at the end of the trial (mated) and females that
did not. Females that eventually mated visited more males and fewer unguarded burrows, consistent
with results reported for two related species, U. pugliator [7] and U. beebei [1]. A study in a third
species U. terpsichores (formerly U. musica) showed that receptive females (females that mated)
visited more males than non-receptive females [8].” (lines 396-401)
390 Yes, and you see this because of total overlap in the selective contexts of searching for a mate and
searching for a territory.
We have added to this section to emphasise your point:
“Here we show that that is not necessarily true: the rejection of a potential mate is not sufficient
evidence of active mate choice. We observed classic visit and reject behaviour by resident females
that were not looking for a mate. Consistent with other studies of Uca species [2], we suggest that all
females behave in the same way because it is the safest way to move through the population and the
selective pressures for territory-searching and mate-searching are nearly identical in these species, as
males are by and large conspicuous signals of the presence of burrows.” (lines 418-423)
400 and subsequent – conclusions. There is even something more fundamental going on here I think.
We are looking at how females respond to courtship signals as their state of sexually receptivity
ranges from one extreme to the other and find no difference in the responses. This implies that
reproductive benefits of mating males that use particular signals need not be invoked to explain the
evolution of the responses. Instead the benefits may be direct and derived from “ecological selection”
rather than ‘social selection.” This is an extremely radical view of the evolution of preference, at least
to those who think that sensory biases and sensory drive are only generative in animal communication
and largely historical “blips” that get swept up by other modes of selection, but perhaps one worth
putting out there.
We have included your point:
“Additionally, we suggest that researchers look more closely at the behaviour of females that are
moving through a population of courting males as mate-searching is not the only possible interpretation
of their behaviour. Rather than looking at apparent mate-searching behaviour as an outcome of social
selection (sensu [15]) we should acknowledge there may be ecology ical selection at work as well.”

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have, in their own words “taken on board” most of the changes I recommended
in my previous review and I thank them for that. We still differ in how to recognize a
sexually receptive and a sexually non-receptive female and hence in how to observe behavior
that leads to mate choice from behavior that does not lead to mate choice. I would contend
that the best way is post-hoc; watch a female to see if she chooses a mate and, if possible,
determine whether she subsequently produces a clutch of eggs. The result is records of the
behavior of mated and un-mated females. The authors chose to examine the behavior of
females that were wandering on the surface (44%, 14/32, chose a mate) and females that
were residents and made to wander (26%, 7/27, chose a mate, rates not statistically
different). They explain
“In these studies (referring to previous studies by me and me and the third author), females
are categorised as receptive and non-receptive based on whether or not they settle with a
male at the end of a trial and these categories must be determined post hoc. Our questions
primarily concern the investigation of behaviours that we associate with mate-searching and
how we define mate-searching behaviour. To do this, we had to define the categories of
females based on their behaviour at the time of capture (wandering the mudflat or residing at
a burrow).
Taking my recommended approach, the behavior a female exhibits before she chooses a
mate constitutes (by definition) mate searching behavior. I don’t understand how “defining
the categories of females based on their behaviour at the time of capture” aids in studying
mate searching behavior; females in both categories, wandering on the mud flat and resident
at a burrow when captured, include some that will and some that will not choose a mate and
produce a clutch of eggs (as shown nicely by this study). Hence some females in each
category will exhibit mate searching behavior and some will not. One only knows after they
do or do not choose a mate. Which takes us back to the post-hoc determination.
Fortunately, the inclusion of both receptive (mated) and non-receptive (un-mated) females in
samples of females that were wandering and were resident at a burrow at the time of capture
does not substantially change the overall conclusions that can be drawn from the study. The
relative proportions of the two classes of females were roughly similar in the two categories
(status when captured) of females. The MANOVA showed no differences in behavior
between wanderer and resident females but that mated (receptive) female visited more
courting males and fewer unguarded burrows compared to un-mated (non-receptive)
females; a difference also found in some past studies.
Less fortunately, in my opinion, the presence of both receptive and non-receptive females in
the two categories of females, “wanderer” and “resident,” makes for somewhat confusing
presentation, at least for the non-fiddler crab specialist. Folks will “buy” the idea that
resident females that are caught and released or that are naturally expelled from their
burrows by intruders will be (“presumably”) non-receptive and will be looking for burrows
(new territories), not for mates, and vice versa for wandering females, and this is not entirely
correct. Only after reading the MANOVA results will it be clear that females that are and
that are not seeking mates occur in both categories. The authors are not obfuscating, indeed
they face the ambiguity straight on, but it still will be confusing for many readers.
We show in our paper that behaviour alone is not a reliable predictor of mating receptivity.
Yes, we agree that the ultimate evidence of receptivity is a combination of mating
observations combined with clutch production, which is why we have this data in our paper.
However, there are studies where researchers cannot observe mating and/or cannot examine
clutch production and rely on behavioural observations to determine whether an animal is
mate-searching. Our study shows that what looks like mate-searching behaviour may not
necessarily be the case. This is the key message and would not be expressed if we
categorized our females post hoc (after mating observations) as in the other fiddler crab
literature.
Page 22, line 52 – 56 the authors state
In U. mjoebergi, females surface mate with neighbours in exchange for help with territory
defense and then wander to choose a mate (Slatyer et al. 2012). (This has been added to the
manuscript: lines 74-77). It is a reasonable hypothesis to postulate that females that are
wandering in order to search for a ‘true’ mate would be likely to produce a clutch of eggs
than resident females. Existing data on sister species refers only to mating receptivity, not on
whether or not this receptivity results in offspring.
Yet, on line 71 – 72 of the revised manuscript the authors state that female Uca lactea, Uca
perplexa (and I added Uca beebei) that mate on the surface with neighboring males do
produce a clutch in their own burrow without then seeking another “true” mate. The apparent
difference between these other species, especially the very closely related Uca lactea and
Uca perplexa and Uca mjoebergi seems odd. Why would male Uca mjoebergi mate on the
surface with neighboring females and then defend them if these females always then leave
their burrows and mate with other males (“true” mates) that father all or almost all the
young? Seems like selection would eliminate that unproductive male behavior fairly quickly.
It is a possibility that selection would eliminate this male behaviour. Given that previous
work has demonstrated this phenomenon does exist, a likely explanation is that the benefits
of surface mating with a neighbour is beneficial on average, and costs very little. A male can
surface mate with a neighbouring female at little to no cost and may sire some offspring with
a chance of securing another mate later (they do continue to court after surface mating).
Without a large cost, the selection pressure may not be sufficiently strong to eliminate this
behaviour.
(I assume that the first version of the ms in the pdf is the revised version and I have used that
one as the basis for the following comments. The second complete copy of the ms at the end
of the pdf appears to be a copy of the first version in this document. Both differ from the
original manuscript.)
Specific comments and suggested changes by line
27 “…and we simulated this by catching and releasing residents away from their burrows
and observing their behavior as they wandered.”
We have made this change.
28 “We predicted that wanderer, which we also caught and released, would exhibit…”
We have incorporated the meaning of this comment, but have changed the wording to stay
within the required word count for the abstract. This now reads:
“We predicted that the displaced wanderers would exhibit more mate-searching behaviours
than resident females.” (lines 28-29)
43 “…moving sequentially between males…”
We have changed this. (line 43)
49-50 “non-reproductive females may behave as they do when seeking mates and thereby
deceive males into allowing them access to male-defended resources.
We have changed this. (line 49-50)
52 – 53 Omit “Non-reproductive females may also mimic the behaviour of mate-searchers to
gain access to a male’s territory (and associated resources).” Repeats sentence above.
We have deleted this sentence.
54 – 57 replace with “The responses of sexually receptive and non-receptive females to male
courtship may not differ because the same sensory biases mediate female behavior in both
contexts.”
We have changed this. (lines 54-55)
The Sensory drive (Endler 1992) hypothesis proposes that properties of the sensory systems
of receivers that evolved due to selection in diverse ecological and social contexts largely
determine what traits and trait values of signalers will be favored by social selection and
evolve. The reference to sensory drive here is not appropriate because you are talking about
how sensory biases shape responses to males not how these biases shape (drive) the signals
males use to attract females.
We have removed this reference and included a more appropriate reference (Dawkins and
Guildford 1996). (lines 52-53)
64 omit “can and do”
These words have been omitted.
66 – 70 Territory-holding females who leave their burrows or are displaced from them by
other crabs also need to acquire new burrows, most of which are held by males. Such
females wander, approach and visit courting males as they seek a new burrow (list of species
in [4]).
We have changed this. (lines 64-67)
71 – 72 “… and incubate in their own burrow (e.g. Uca lacteal (refs), Uca perplexa (refs) and
Uca beebei (Christy 1998)). Other females will leave their burrows to search for a mate.”
The notion of a “true” wanderer is not helpful, although I know what you mean – a
wandering sexually receptive female that will stop wandering by choosing a mate. You
might say that these other females have mature ovaries (evidence in Yamaguchi 2001 and
Murai et al. 1997), are sexually receptive, and look for and finally choose a mate.
We have made the wording change and added the point you suggested. This section now
reads:
“In some Uca species, territory-holding females will mate on the surface and incubate in
their own burrows (e.g. U. lactea [5, 6] and U. perplexa [7]). Other females will leave their
burrows to search for a mate. These females have mature ovaries [5, 6], are sexually
receptive and search for and choose a mate.” (lines 67-70)
79 – 85 “presumably non-receptive” As the study shows, this presumption is wrong; some
evicted or displace females are receptive. Your working assumption - that receptivity is a
property of the category of female – wandering or resident - is not correct as shown by
previous studies of other species of Uca.
We have deleted ‘presumably non-receptive.’
101 “…prior to capture. We do not know…”
We made this change. (lines 98-99)
277 – 281 The responses of mated and non-mated Uca mjoebergi compare favorably with
the responses of receptive and non-receptive Uca pugilator (Christy 1983) and Uca beebei
(Christy 1987).
We do not think that this is appropriate for inclusion in a Results section. We have included
this in the Discussion. This section (unchanged) reads:
“The only behavioural differences we could detect were not between wanderers and
residents, but between females that ended up in a burrow with a male at the end of the trial
(mated) and females that did not. Females that eventually mated visited more males and
fewer unguarded burrows, consistent with results reported for two related species, U.
pugliator [30] and U. beebei [11].” (lines 395-398)
306 Females don’t “release” eggs. In fact they are very careful to retain them so that they
adhere to the setae on their pleopods. Please say “produced a clutch of eggs” or similar.
This now says ‘produce a clutch of eggs.’ (line 304)
344 These anthropomorphic terms are inappropriate. We cannot know whether crabs believe
anything. How about something a bit more agnostic like “The benefits of having access to a
burrow may favor females that exhibit the same responses to male courtship whether or not
they are seeking mates. In this way non-receptive females may deceive males into allowing
them to approach and enter their burrows as males do for receptive females.”
We have made this change. (lines 341-344)
367 and forward “responses” may be better than “sensory biases” in this argument. We
observe what females do – how they respond to male courtship and hence an emphasis on
responses may be best.
We have changed this terminology. This section now reads:
“Our data suggest that selection has shaped the behaviour of mate-searching and burrow-
searching females in the same way. Both types of females display the same responses to
courting males irrespective of what they are searching for as the presence of a male reliably
signals the location of a burrow. Either females evolved their responses in the context of
finding a new territory and were later co-opted into the mate-searching context or vice versa
[23].” (lines 363-367)
389 – The behaviors of these females are not shaped by a sensory trap. A sensory trap occurs
when an animal makes a response to some stimuli as if these stimuli were something they are
not. Females are not caught in a sensory trap when they respond to courting males and
burrows. If there is a sensory trap here, a form of deception it is worked on males not
females. Both sexually receptive and non-receptive females respond in the same way to
males and males therefor are deceived by the non-receptive females into granting them
access to their burrows as if they were receptive females. Please recast this sentence to
remove the incorrect use of “sensory trap.”
We have removed the term ‘sensory trap’ and replaced it with ‘sensory biases’ which our
data suggests are held by the females. This section now reads:
“What evidence do we have that non-receptive females are exhibiting deceptive behaviours
consistent with their sensory biases [3]? If non-mate-searching females are mimicking mate-
searchers in order to gain access to their burrows, then they should not exhibit a preference
for ‘attractive’ male traits since male quality is irrelevant for females only interested in a
burrow to shelter in. Here we show that all females preferentially approached large, fast
waving males that produced leading signals. Whilst non-receptive females are still deceiving
the males, this consistent preference for male traits adds weight to the idea that females’
sensory biases are used in any contexts involving moving around on the mudflat.” (lines 386-
393)
389 – 391 This argument is backward. Females are approaching males and burrows whether
or not they (the females) are receptive because they benefit directly from doing so – this
reduces their risk while moving on the surface searching either for a mate and breeding site
or a burrow and new territory.
Yes they are approaching burrows, but the argument here is that all of the females (receptive
and non-receptive) preferentially approach males with large claws, fast and leading waves.
Yes, approaching males reduces the risks associated with moving across the mudflat, but if
the male doesn’t matter for a non-receptive female, why do they display a preference?
Females are not being deceived by the males.
This text does not mention that females are being deceived by the males, in fact, we state the
opposite:
“Whilst non-receptive females are still deceiving the males, this consistent preference for
male traits…” (line 391-392)
Failure to receive possible benefits from mating with the courting male is not a cost when the
females is not seeking a mate. Contrary to the statement here females not seeking mates
should respond to courtship and in just the same way (nearly so) as they do when seeking
mates as this study shows.
We agree there would be no benefit for the female to choose an ‘attractive’ male when she is
only looking for a burrow. We do not see that we have made a contrary statement here.
Again, we maintain the argument that if looking only for a burrow, it is reasonable to
hypothesise that burrow- searching females should just approach any male, not preferentially
approach an ‘attractive’ one.
There is no selection against responding in the same way to courtship whether or not the
female is seeking a mate.
No there is not, and we did not make this statement. However, if burrow-searchers did not
behave in the same way as mate-searchers, males would be able to detect and repel them.
There may not be selection against responding in the same way, but there would be selection
against responding in a different way.
394 Yes – this is the key point I think. Mate searching occurs in ecological time and space
and there is total contextual overlap between seeking a mate and seeking a new burrow and
location on the mudflat. This has led to selection on females to respond in the same manner
to courtship whether or not they will mate with the males in the burrows they visit.
