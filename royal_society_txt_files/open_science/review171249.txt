The manuscript reports the preparation of glycated phosphatidylethanolamine (GPE) obtained
via the Amadori reaction. The glycated phospholipid was then used in mixture with
phosphatidylcholine (PC) as a delivery vector for curcumin (CUR), a lipophilic food additive. The
liposome formed by GPE and PC have been characterized by DLS and zeta potentials
measurements. The results show that at given lipid ratios uniform liposomes are formed and that
the zeta potential becomes more negative in the presence of GPE. The encapsulation efficiency
(EE) of CUR as well as the ability to deliver CUR to Caco-2 cells were also investigated showing
that the liposome containing GPE are more effective in the delivery of the substrate probably
thanks to the interaction with the glucose transporters (GLUTs) highly expressed in the cancerous
cell line. Moreover the negative Z-potential of the mixed liposomes should ensure less
nonspecific adsorption in vivo respect to PC liposomes. Thus this system may represent a new
delivery vector with promising properties. The results are interesting, the work is well conducted
both in the experimental part and in the analysis of the results and the conclusion are well
supported by the data. I recommend publication with some minor revision.
-) The Results and Discussion section should be better organized because there some repetitions.
For example at line 43 of page 3 the dimension of the liposomes and the unimodal distribution is
reported and this is repeated at line 58 and following. Another example: at page 3 line 48 is
reported the yield of the glycation reaction which is repeated at line 12 of page 4. I think that this
section needs some rewriting.
-) At line 46 of page 3 should be “did” and not “did not”

Comments to the Author(s)

In this work author claimed that they have developed a strategy for the preparation of stable
liposome with selective targeting ability. This is a relevant paper in the field of liposome for
biological applications. In my opinion, this paper can be accepted for publication in “Royal
Society Open Science” if author can address the following concerns.
a) To put schematic presentation of the reaction for the synthesis of glycated lipids is suggested
and also it is important to put the characterization data of synthesized lipid in the paper. (e.g.
NMR, MASS)
b) Author claimed it is thought that due to high negative zeta potential the liposomes will be
stable in dispersions, but there is no potential evidence or data for the stability of liposome. Time
dependent DLS and Zeta potential data are necessary to check the stability of the liposome.
c) It is important to provide microscopic evidence for the formation of liposome. (TEM or cryo
TEM)
d) Please provide cellular image (fluorescence microscopy image) for the cellular uptake.

Authors' answer:
Thank you very much for interest in our research. We highly appreciate your
accurate advice for preparation of this manuscript to be better than before. We
made modifications to this manuscript according to your suggestions. We would
like you to confirm the revised comment and manuscript below. In accord with
your “Reviewer Comments”, we revised our manuscript and used the “yellow
highlight” feature to represent changes.
Reviewer comments:1.
The Results and Discussion section should be better organized because there
some repetitions. For example at line 43 of page 3 the dimension of the
liposomes and the unimodal distribution is reported and this is repeated at line
58 and following. Another example: at page 3 line 48 is reported the yield of the
glycation reaction which is repeated at line 12 of page 4. I think that this section
needs some rewriting.
Authors' answer:
As you say, “results and discussion” of our previous manuscript were hard to
understand. Because, within the “results and discussion”, we wrote results in
the first part and discussion in the second half of the sentence. We thought that
this way of writing much confused the reader. So, we separated “results and
discussion” to “results” and “discussion” into Revised MS P7L27 and P7L47.
We think this way of writing is readable.
Reviewer comments:2.
At line 46 of page 3 should be “did” and not “did not”
Authors' answer:
Thank you for finding typos. We changed “did not” to “did” into revised MS
P7L39.

Reviewer #2: In this work author claimed that they have developed a strategy
for the preparation of stable liposome with selective targeting ability. This is a
relevant paper in the field of liposome for biological applications. In my opinion,
this paper can be accepted for publication in “Royal Society Open Science” if
author can address the following concerns.
Authors' answer:
Thank you very much for reviewing our manuscript and evaluation. We would
like you to confirm the revised comment and manuscript below. In accord with
your “Reviewer Comments”, we revised our manuscript and used the “yellow

Reviewer comments:1.
To put schematic presentation of the reaction for the synthesis of glycated lipids
is suggested and also it is important to put the characterization data of
synthesized lipid in the paper. (e.g. NMR, MASS)
Authors' answer:
Thank you very much for your advice. We added the schematic presentation
figure of glycated lipid synthesis (Figure 2, revised MS P6L31 and P10L3 to L5).
Also, we added characterization data of synthesized lipid by LC-MS/MS (Figure
3, revised MS P6L34 and MS P6L31 and P10L7 to L9).
Reviewer comments:2.
Author claimed it is thought that due to high negative zeta potential the
liposomes will be stable in dispersions, but there is no potential evidence or
data for the stability of liposome. Time dependent DLS and Zeta potential data
are necessary to check the stability of the liposome.
Authors' answer:
Thank you very much for your advice. We can’t do such experiment soon.
However, we added “On the other hand, we didn’t confirmed the time
dependent stability of each liposomes. More research is needed to clarify such
details.” into revised MS P8L15 to P8L16.
Reviewer comments:3.
It is important to provide microscopic evidence for the formation of liposome.
(TEM or cryo TEM)
Authors' answer:
Thank you very much for your advice. However, we can’t use SEM and TEM.
We would like to try in the future.
Reviewer comments:4
Please provide cellular image (fluorescence microscopy image) for the cellular
uptake.
Authors' answer:
Thank you very much for your accurate advice. However, unfortunately, it needs
long optimization for us to use microscope and difficult for us to do this
experiment within deadline. We would like to try in the future.
