The present MS proposed a second step MAO process at different voltages to prepare composite
coatings on a Mg-Zn-Ca allo in order to decrease the degradation rate and increase the bioactivity
of the alloy. The microstructure and morphology of the samples were characterised. There are
some issues should be addressed before its publication in the journal.
1. The authors claimed that the coatings on the Mg alloy formed via the MAO process were
composed of two layers by SEM images. However, the double-layer structure is unclear. It is
better to indicate the inner layer and the outer porous layer in the image. Moreover, how to
determine the double layer should be given. The boundary between them is not clear.
2. why does the coating C3 have the most positive corrosion potential during the
potentiodynamic polarization curves?
3. Caption of Figure 8: “Hemolysis retio” should be “Hemolysis ratio”.
Conclusion: grammar mistake, “The following conclusions can be drawn: the present work. The

Comments to the Author(s)
The present MS proposed a second step MAO process at different
voltages to prepare composite coatings on a Mg-Zn-Ca allo in order to
decrease the degradation rate and increase the bioactivity of the alloy.
The microstructure and morphology of the samples were characterised.
There are some issues should be addressed before its publication in the
journal.
v Thanks for your useful comments and suggestions on our
manuscript. We have modified the manuscript carefully and
completely according to your requirements to improve the quality
of our work. The detailed changes have been listed point by point:
(The revised parts have been marked with blue for Reviewer #1’s
comments)
1. The authors claimed that the coatings on the Mg alloy formed via
the MAO process were composed of two layers by SEM images.
However, the double-layer structure is unclear. It is better to indicate
the inner layer and the outer porous layer in the image. Moreover, how
to determine the double layer should be given. The boundary between
them is not clear.
v Thank you for your useful comments. The double-layer
structure of MAO coatings in our SEM images is not clear. The
inner layer and the outer porous layer cannot be determined. So
we deleted the information of inner layer and the outer porous
layer in our manuscript.
Cross-sectional SEM images of MAO coatings using different
treatment condition are shown in Fig. 3. As it can be seen, the MAO
coatings have a significant amount of connected micropores, cracks
and other structural defects. The MAO coating However,
inhomogeneous defects did not penetrate into the whole coating. In
addition, no obvious voids or cracks were observed between the MAO
coatings and the magnesium substrate, suggesting good adhesion
between the coating and the Mg substrate.
The coating C1 formed by first step MAO process (Fig. 3(a)), was
about 20 µm thick. In addition, the coating contained big voids and
cracks. This is consistent with the coating C1 surface morphology, Fig.
2(a), which showed a high density of open (un-sealed) channels at the
center of the ‘pancake’ structures, which could extend to the
coating-substrate interface. The coating C2 formed by second step
MAO process (Fig. 3(b)) were much thicker and more compact
compared with the coating C1 (Fig. 3(a)), with a thickness of about 40
µm. As the voltage of second step process increases, the coating
thickness increases. The thickness of the coatings was in the range of
70–90 µm and 210–250 µm for the samples treated for 450 and 500 V,
respectively. The coating C3 was compact and had little voids.
However, when the voltage was increased to 500 V, the resulting
coating C4 (Fig. 3(d)) was almost completely composed of a porous
layer.
2. why does the coating C3 have the most positive corrosion potential
during the potentiodynamic polarization curves?
v Thank you for your useful comments.
The difference in the corrosion resistance between these MAO
coatings is probably caused by the difference in the coating thickness
and microstructure (total number of both the small and large pores).
The coating C3 has the most uniform and compact structure which acts
as a barrier against transfer of corrosive ion (Cl-) from aggressive
environment into the coating.
We have discussed the relationship of corrosion potential and structure.
Therefore, we do not discuss that in this manuscript.
3. Caption of Figure 8: “Hemolysis retio” should be “Hemolysis ratio”.
Conclusion: grammar mistake, “The following conclusions can be
drawn: the present work. The following conclusions can be drawn:”…
v We are so sorry for our carelessness.
We have changed the Caption of Figure 8: “Hemolysis retio” into
“Hemolysis ratio”
We have removed the “the present work. The following conclusions
can be drawn:” from conclusions.
4. How about the performance of the single CaP coating? The
comparison work may be also carried out on the CaP coatings.
v Thank you for your useful comments.
We have compared the CaP and CaP-Si coatings in our paper Physical
Chemistry Chemical Physics, 2017, 19(23): 15110-15119. Therefore,
we do not compare the single CaP coating in this manuscript.
5. Some novel coating works on the Mg alloys might be referred, such
as Corrosion Science (2016) 106C, 108; ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces,
2017, 9 (12), 11247.
v Thank you for your useful comments. We have carefully read
the papers and cited in our manuscript.
