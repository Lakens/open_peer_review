label_comment_1
I begin by reiterating my previous assessment that this is a very well-constructed manuscript that
describes an excellent series of experiments. The core result is the discovery of a stop codon
mutation in a desaturase gene that has a profound effect on female pheromone blend but no
detectable effect on male response or other fitness components. This will certainly be of interest in
the field of pheromone communication and the wider field of signal-response evolution.
My principal concern with the version that I saw previously was a tendency to over-state the
significance of the results. This arose largely through implying extension of the observations on
this laboratory mutation to variation in natural populations. With some reluctance, the authors
have adjusted the MS appropriately, in most places, as well as responding to my other minor
comments and those of the second reviewer.
I have a few remaining issues. They are all small wording changes, in a sense, but I think they are
significant in terms of getting the message right.
Final sentence of abstract – “… a single point mutation that underlies the phenotypic
variation…”. This is still inclined to give the wrong impression because ‘the phenotypic variation’
can easily be read as the variation present in nature. “ … a single point mutation that alters the
pheromone signal of a moth” would be preferable.
69 – I suggest replacing ‘within-population variation’ with ‘difference between lines’. Then on
line 73, make clear that this is 99% of the variance in the QTL cross, not in the source population
and on line 75 replace ‘contributes to the within-population female pheromone variation’ with
‘can contribute to female pheromone variation’.
258-260 – is ‘X-square’ here the same as ‘Chi-square’? If so, the numbers look to be incorrect. If
not, please explain the test.
I don’t agree that p=0.066 is ‘marginal significant’ (now line 318), even if the authors ‘prefer’ this
wording (see response). The authors actually describe it as ‘just missed significance’ on line 225. If
the cut-off is p=0.05, this is simply not significant.
331-2 – “These results confirm that in Heliothis virescens, independent and unlinked genes
govern the variation in the female pheromone signal and the male pheromone response.” I
disagree. The results reveal a single mutation in a single gene that influences pheromone blend
but not male response. This may tend to support a general picture of independent genetic
determination but it does not ‘confirm’ it.
339-348 – this is a useful addition. I think that the genetic independence of pheromone blend and
male response in Ostrinia should also be mentioned at this point. It would also be good to
mention here the evidence in Heliconius (Lepidoptera) for pleiotropic effects on preference of
major genes influencing visual signals. [cited as ref. 24]
In response to Rev. 2, the authors say: “Loss of a functional delta-11 desaturase activity in the
female pheromone gland of H. gelotopoeon is the only possible explanation of this phenomenon.
Therefore it is appropriate to retain the reference to saltational evolution at this point of the
Discussion.”
The implication is that loss of function must be saltational (now line 370). I don’t agree. The end
result of loss of function can be reached in a series of small steps.

Appendix A
- dont call the components pheromones if there is no evidence of 16Ald having
any effect on the behavioral response of males. Call them instead pheromone
gland components or something similar. THere are several locations (eg line 53,
184), which i leave to the authors to identify and correct.
Answer: In the pheromone literature, there is general agreement on calling a
gland chemical a
pheromone component when an attractive response of conspecific males has
been shown, and
a pheromone compound when this is not so clear. This is thus the nomenclature
that we are
using throughout this manuscript.
I suggest to change pheromone compound to pheromone GLAND
compound/component. The difference between component/compound is not so
generally understood. I would strongly advise to revise so no-one gets confused.
- line 27 : the dynamic mechanisms. I am not sure if one should call the
mechanisms dynamic or rather diverse, the first implying that the mechanisms
(eg selected genes that induce change) are themselves dynamic .. well you get
the idea
Answer: We don't understand the reviewer's point here, but we have removed
the word
"dynamic".
to clarify: dynamic mechanisms imply that the mechanisms themselves are dynamic
instead of (what is meant) that mechanisms cause pheromone communication to be
dynamic (as implied by evolution).
- line 298: does amount of precursor being generated (in this case 16Ald)
depend on the activity of the enzyme that converts it to the pheromone (in this
case z11-16Ald)? This is the case in many microbes. I mention this as inthe low
lines increasing the amount of Z11-16Ald (eg higher enzymatic conversion)
could simply lead to more 16Ald be produced (maybe with
pleiotropic effects on Z9-14Ald, see also fig 1a and comments below) and thus
not change the ratio. In that light it could be good if the authors not only
present relative amounts, but also absolute quantities (if the the above would
be true one would expect more pheromone compounds and precursors in the
low lines)
Answer: We do not understand the reviewer’s point, as he writes that an
increasing amount of Z11-16:Ald can lead to more 16:Ald, which is opposite to
our observations. Moreover, we have not assayed enzyme activity directly. It
is the ratio between 16:Ald and Z11-16:Ald that is changed, as is written
throughout the manuscript (i.e the ratio being < 1 or > 1), meaning that more
16:Ald is directly related to less Z11-16:Ald.
To explain: In biological systems, depleting a substrate by higher enzymatic
activity can lead to an increased production of the substrate. In this case, when
selecting for lower 16:Ald, the slection lines may have favored increased
enzymatic activity in the gland. This may have caused more 16:ald being
produced (nd converted into pheromone components). In effect there is no
change in ratio. However, there may be a change in absolute amount of
pheromone components being produced.
However, the authors did now mentioned that the absolute quantity in the low
lines was lower than the high lines, which shows that the above is not the case.
Please insert a line in the results on the absolute quantity

Dear editors,
Thank you for your positive decision, we are very pleased that our manuscript
is accepted for publication inRoyal Society Open Science. Please find our
specific answers to the last comments of the reviewer below. We hope that
our manuscript is now ready for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Kind regards, Astrid Groot
Reviewer: 1
I have a few remaining issues. They are all small wording
changes, in a sense, but I think they are significant in terms
of getting the message right.
Final sentence of abstract – “… a single point mutation that
underlies the phenotypic variation…”. This is still inclined to
give the wrong impression because ‘the phenotypic variation’
can easily be read as the variation present in nature. “ … a
single point mutation that alters the pheromone signal of a
moth” would be preferable.
Answer: Throughout the abstract we write that this work is done on selection
lines. We prefer to keep the wording as is.
69 – I suggest replacing ‘within-population variation’ with
‘difference between lines’.
Answer: We prefer our wording.
Then on line 73, make clear that this is 99% of the variance in
the QTL cross, not in the source population
Answer: We don’t write ‘the source population’, we write: “99% of the
variance in the pheromone ratio produced by females.” In line 69 we specify
that this QTL analysis was done on the selection lines.
and on line 75 replace ‘contributes to the within-population
female pheromone variation’ with ‘can contribute to female
pheromone variation’.
Answer: We prefer our wording. “Can” suggests that there is another
possibility, which is not the case in our data.
258-260 – is ‘X-square’ here the same as ‘Chi-square’? If so,
the numbers look to be incorrect. If not, please explain the
test.
Answer: We thank the reviewer for finding these mistakes, the numbers were
indeed incorrect and are now corrected. To omit any possible mistake in
writing Chi-square (should be Chi-squared), we now changed this to X2.
I don’t agree that p=0.066 is ‘marginal significant’ (now line
318), even if the authors ‘prefer’ this wording (see response).
The authors actually describe it as ‘just missed significance’
on line 225. If the cut-off is p=0.05, this is simply not
significant.
Answer: we do not agree with the reviewer, the cut-off of a significance of
0.05 is a general agreement, but to dismiss data that are just above this line
would be dismissing data that are potentially interesting. Therefore, we point
out this result.
331-2 – “These results confirm that in Heliothis virescens,
independent and unlinked genes govern the variation in the
female pheromone signal and the male pheromone response.” I
disagree. The results reveal a single mutation in a single gene
that influences pheromone blend but not male response. This may
tend to support a general picture of independent genetic
determination but it does not ‘confirm’ it.
Answer: We have changed the wording to read “These results are consistent
with previous findings that in Heliothis virescens, …"
339-348 – this is a useful addition. I think that the genetic
independence of pheromone blend and male response in Ostrinia
should also be mentioned at this point. It would also be good
to mention here the evidence in Heliconius (Lepidoptera) for
pleiotropic effects on preference of major genes influencing
visual signals. [cited as ref. 24]
Answer: To add this example would require another paragraph of explaining
that system.
In response to Rev. 2, the authors say: “Loss of a functional
delta-11 desaturase activity in the female pheromone gland of
H. gelotopoeon is the only possible explanation of this
phenomenon. Therefore it is appropriate to retain the reference
to saltational evolution at this point of the Discussion.”
The implication is that loss of function must be saltational
(now line 370). I don’t agree. The end result of loss of
function can be reached in a series of small steps.
Answer: The reviewer is not correct. We are not implying that loss of
function MUST be saltational, as the reviewer claims, but that it MAY be. Our
text reads: “This would provide a possible example of a saltational shift…”
and we stand by this wording.
==========================
Answers to reviewer 2
the behavioral response of males. Call them instead pheromone gland components or
something similar. THere are several locations (eg line 53, 184), which i leave to the
authors to identify and correct.
Answer: In the pheromone literature, there is general agreement on calling a gland
chemical a pheromone component when an attractive response of conspecific males
has been shown, and a pheromone compound when this is not so clear. This is thus
the nomenclature that we are using throughout this manuscript.
I suggest to change pheromone compound to pheromone GLAND
compound/component. The
difference between component/compound is not so generally understood. I
would strongly advise to revise so no-one gets confused.
Answer (10 Feb): We find it important to stick to the nomenclature that is used in
the pheromone literature. As explained, pheromone compounds is the generally
used term (see e.g. Cardé R & R, Millar JG (eds) 2004. Advances in insect chemical
ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Wyatt 2010. J. Comp. Physiol. A
196: 685-700). In addition, we have shown that all pheromone compounds present
in the gland of Heliothis virescens are also emitted (see Lievers R & Groot AT. Plos
One Plos One 11(8): e0161138). We now added one line in the introduction with this
information and the reference (lines 66-67)
- line 27 : the dynamic mechanisms. I am not sure if one should call the mechanisms
dynamic or rather diverse, the first implying that the mechanisms (eg selected genes
that induce change) are themselves dynamic .. well you get the idea
Answer: We don't understand the reviewer's point here, but we have removed the
word
"dynamic".
to clarify: dynamic mechanisms imply that the mechanisms themselves are
dynamic instead of (what is meant) that mechanisms cause pheromone
communication to be dynamic (as implied by evolution).
Answer (10 Feb): Thank you for this clarification. As we removed the word
‘dynamic’, we assume this point has been resolved.
- line 298: does amount of precursor being generated (in this case 16Ald) depend on
the
activity of the enzyme that converts it to the pheromone (in this case z11-16Ald)?
This is the
case in many microbes. I mention this as inthe low lines increasing the amount of
Z11-16Ald
(eg higher enzymatic conversion) could simply lead to more 16Ald be produced
(maybe with
pleiotropic effects on Z9-14Ald, see also fig 1a and comments below) and thus not
change the
ratio. In that light it could be good if the authors not only present relative amounts,
but also
absolute quantities (if the the above would be true one would expect more
pheromone
compounds and precursors in the low lines)
Answer: We do not understand the reviewer’s point, as he writes that an increasing
amount
of Z11-16:Ald can lead to more 16:Ald, which is opposite to our observations.
Moreover, we
have not assayed enzyme activity directly. It is the ratio between 16:Ald and Z11-
16:Ald that
is changed, as is written throughout the manuscript (i.e the ratio being < 1 or > 1),
meaning
that more 16:Ald is directly related to less Z11-16:Ald.
To explain: In biological systems, depleting a substrate by higher enzymatic activity
can lead
to an increased production of the substrate. In this case, when selecting for lower
16:Ald, the
slection lines may have favored increased enzymatic activity in the gland. This may
have
caused more 16:ald being produced (nd converted into pheromone components). In
effect
there is no change in ratio. However, there may be a change in absolute amount of
pheromone
components being produced.
However, the authors did now mentioned that the absolute quantity in the low lines
was lower
than the high lines, which shows that the above is not the case. Please insert a line in
the
results on the absolute quantity
Answer (10 Feb): We now added the absolute quantities in the results (lines 218-
219)
