“mono(catecholamide) derivatives were excellent antioxidant”
“Iron-related oxidative stress provide a reasonable ground”
“Over the decades, a approach for design of hexadentate chelating agents for iron(III) was
inspired by siderophores enterobactin, a naturally occurring microbial iron(III) chelating agent,

“Conforms with”
And so on.
This manuscript by Zhang et al. describes the synthesis , the chelating ability and antioxidant
activity in vitro of new catecholamide derivatives.
However, before publication, the authors should address the following major points:
1) DPPH radical assay or another antioxidant assay should be carried out in the presence of iron.
The iron complexes of the derivatives should be tested for their antioxidant activities because the
values of stability constants suggest that complexes could be physiologically relevant species
when administrated.
2) A picture of the complex species should be reported.
3) The self-plagiarism of the abstract (29%) should be reduced compared to the article entitled
“New tris(dopamine) derivative as an iron chelator. Synthesis, solution thermodynamic stability,
and antioxidant research”

An interesting paper reporting a well conducted experimental work.Some points have to be
revised prior of publications.
Pag. 2 row 57 at reference 17 should be added the reference to the original article by Lipinski
regarding drug absorption (Lipinski C.A., Lombardo F., Dominy B.W., Feeney P.J. (1997)
Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 23, 3).
Pag 3 The section from row 3 to row 11 should be rewritten; it is not clear.
Pag. 5 row 32 in references 27 and 28 should be added the address from which the last versions
of HypSpec 2014 and Hypquad 2013 can be downloaded.

protonation and complex formation constant is 19.368; in the same table you should also change
the pFe value 17.71, with the more reliable 20.5, from Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry 102 (2008)

Appendix A
Dear Reviewers,
Thank you for your comments concerning our manuscript entitled The Mono(catecholamine)
Derivatives as Iron Chelators. Synthesis, Solution Thermodynamic Stability and Antioxidant
Properties Research (Manuscript ID: RSOS-171492). These comments are very valuable and
helpful for improving our manuscript, as well as the important guiding significance to our
researches. We have studied comments carefully and made a serious revision. We hope meet with
reviewer’s approval. Revised portion are marked in red in revised manuscript and revised
supplementary information. The main revision in the manuscript and the responds to the
reviewer’s comments are listed below.
Reviewer 1#:
Comment 1:
English should be revised in grammar and style, as several typos are present,
“mono(catecholamide) derivatives were excellent antioxidant”
“Iron-related oxidative stress provide a reasonable ground”
“Over the decades, a approach for design of hexadentate chelating agents for iron(III) was inspired
by siderophores enterobactin, a naturally occurring microbial iron(III) chelating agent,which have
favorable geometric arrangement with iron(III) coordination preference”
“Conforms with”.
And so on.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s carefully review. We are very sorry for our negligence in
grammar, typos and spelling errors. We have made revision in our revised manuscript according to
the reviewer’s comments. In the same time, we have made a careful check in manuscript to avoid
the similar mistakes.
Comment 2:
DPPH radical assay or another antioxidant assay should be carried out in the presence of iron.
The iron complexes of the derivatives should be tested for their antioxidant activities because the
values of stability constants suggest that complexes could be physiologically relevant species
when administrated.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion and review. The DPPH assay of the iron
complexes should be carried out. So, we complement the DPPH assay of all iron complexes
(Figures. 1-3), the results shown in the Table 1.
Figure 1. (a) The kinetic curves of complex FeIII-L1H2 with different concentrations n, (b) The
curve of percentage of remaining DPPH·against concentration n.

curve of percentage of remaining DPPH·against concentration n.
Figure 3. (a) The kinetic curves of complex FeIII-L3H2 with different concentrations n, (b) The
curve of percentage of remaining DPPH·against concentration n.

From the results of Table 1, the AE values of the FeIII-L1-3H2 system reduce generally, which
can be explained by mechanism of the DPPH react with phenols (ArOH). The antioxidant capacity
of the L1-3H2 will be influenced by the metal coordination. Nitrogen centered radicals DPPH react
with ArOH through two different mechanisms: (I) a direct abstraction of phenolic H-atom (HAT
reaction) and (II) an electron transfer process form ArOH or its phenoxide anion (ArO-) to DPPH
(ET reactions). Generally in polar solvents, capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds with the
ArOH molecules, the ET mechanism becomes predominant. In polar solvent, the electron-transfer
process form the ArO- to DPPH free radical is fast. The presence in the solvent of adventitious
acids, which reduces the quantity of ArO-, reduction of the observed values of the reaction rate.
(I) ArOH + DPPH· ArO· + H-DPPH
ArO· + DPPH· ArO-DPPH
(II) ArOH ArO- + H+
ArO- + DPPH· ArO· + DPPH-
DPPH- + H+ H-DPPH
ArO· + DPPH· ArO-DPPH
Meanwhile, metal coordination reaction produce acids and ArO-M complex. The acids and
coordination reaction are all reduces the quantity of ArO-, and reduction the antioxidant capacity.
Although the coordination reaction reduce the antioxidant capacity, chelating therapy always gave
relative excess ligands, and excess ligands, such as ArOH, still carry out antioxidant reaction.
Comment 3:
A picture of the complex species should be reported.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. The proposed complexation processes and a
picture of complex species are shown in revised manuscript (Figure 4.).
Figure 4. Proposed complexation processes of ligands L1-3H2, the charge numbers are omitted for
clarity.
Comment 4:
The self-plagiarism of the abstract (29%) should be reduced compared to the article entitled
“New tris(dopamine) derivative as an iron chelator. Synthesis, solution thermodynamic stability,
and antioxidant research”
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. We have made revision in our revised manuscript
according to the reviewer’s comments.
Reviewer 2#:
Comment 1:
Pag. 2 row 57 at reference 17 should be added the reference to the original article by Lipinski
regarding drug absorption (Lipinski C.A., Lombardo F., Dominy B.W., Feeney P.J. (1997)
Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 23, 3).
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. We have made revision in our revised manuscript.
According to the reviewer’s comments, we have added the original article in manuscript.
Comment 2:
Pag 3 The section from row 3 to row 11 should be rewritten; it is not clear.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. We have rewritten the section in our revised
manuscript.
Comment 3:
Pag. 5 row 32 in references 27 and 28 should be added the address from which the last
versions of HypSpec 2014 and Hypquad 2013 can be downloaded.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. The last versions of HypSpec 2014 and Hypquad
2013 can’t be free downloaded, we purchased form Beijing Hongcam Software Technologied Co.,
Ltd. (Web site: http://www.hongcam.com.cn/). So we didn’t added the address in manuscript.
Comment 4:
Table 3. The pFe value 19.54 for the first ligand is not correct; the calculated one with the
reported protonation and complex formation constant is 19.368; in the same table you should also
change the pFe value 17.71, with the more reliable 20.5, from Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry
102 (2008) 684-692, also used by Hider in your reference 22 Table 2. Add the reference to this
paper to reference 39.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s carefully review. We are very sorry for our negligence in
calculated pFe value of ligand L1H2 and improperly cited reference. We have made revision in our
revised manuscript according to the reviewer’s comments.
Comment 5:
Pag. 10 rows 39-40 In the caption of Fig. 7 add the concentrations at which the distribution
curves were calculated. The same for figures S7 and S8.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s carefully review. According to the reviewer’s comments, we
have added the concentrations in our revised manuscript.
