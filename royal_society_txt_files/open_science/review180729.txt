Review of Ji et al. “Integrated biomarker responses of submerged macrophyte Vallisneria spiralis
with the hydrological process from Lake Poyang, China”
General comments
This manuscript reports the effects of different levels of flooding on the growth of and
antioxidant enzyme activity within the wetland plant Vallisneria spiralis. The objective of this
study was to use a laboratory experiment simulating historical levels of low, normal, and high
wetland plant submersion in Poyang Lake, China to understand how light intensity, plant height,
plant biomass, and antioxidant enzyme activity respond to these different hydrologic conditions
over six months. The authors found that light intensity was different from the control in both the
low and high water level treatments, but that plant height, aboveground, and belowground
biomass were only different from the control in the high water level treatment. Biomarker
responses seem to only have responded to the high water level treatment as well, but the
meaning of these different biomarker responses is difficult to interpret as the reader.
The results of this study are interesting and contribute to our understanding of how wetland
plants such as Vallisneria spiralis respond to variation in hydrologic conditions. This work is
important to understanding of how the Three Gorges Reservoir is changing downstream
ecosystems.
Although this work contributes important information as to how Vallisneria spiralis growth and
antioxidant enzyme activity within the plant respond to water level fluctuations, there are many
key details that are missing, particularly in regard to the hypothesis, methods, and data analysis.
Here are some major suggestions:
1) While the introduction does a good job of setting up the importance of the study, the authors
could do a better job of explaining what their predictions or hypotheses were for the experiment.
2) The methods need much more detailed information. Were the glass jars (tanks?) outside, in a
greenhouse, or indoors? Was water temperature measured? Where was the water that was in the
tanks from? At what frequency did the authors add nutrients to the water? On what plant
material did the authors conduct the biomarker assays? Were plants destructively sampled to
determine biomass, or were they weighed while still wet? Etc… The authors should write the
methods so that a reader would have enough information to exactly replicate the study.
3) There is no explanation of which statistical tests the authors used beyond generally stating that
Excel was used. It is very important that the authors choose the appropriate analysis for tests
among groups, especially if the data are not normally distributed.
4) I would also recommend that the authors pay particular attention to improving the grammar
in their manuscript. Notably, much of the manuscript was written in the future tense. Given that
3
this experiment was already conducted, the authors should never use the future tense and
instead use the past tense (or present tense where appropriate).
With major revisions, the authors should be able to clarify the missing information in the
methods and reduce grammatical errors in the writing. This study should be of interest to a broad
audience given the increasing construction of dams around the globe that are having
downstream impacts on the hydrologic conditions experienced by wetland plants.
Specific comments:
Note: I will not be correcting all of the grammatical mistakes in the manuscript. Instead, I aim to
provide comments on the substance of the writing.
ABSTRACT
Line 2: Add “,China” after Lake Poyang
Line 16-17: Do not use acronyms in abstracts without defining them
End: Try to add a general sentence that brings all of the results (including biomass, antioxidant
enzyme activities, etc.) together into a main final conclusion of the study -- Something like “We
found that high flooding levels had the strongest negative effect on growth and enzyme activity
of Vallisneria spiralis”
INTRODUCTION
Page 3, Line 29: What do the authors mean by “As the energy source of photosynthesis, rhythmic
changes in wetland water level can effect….”? Do they mean to say that water is affecting the
light levels? The way the sentence is written as of now it sounds like the authors are saying that
water is the energy source
Page 4, Line 22: It would be helpful for there to be a map of where the lake is in China, maybe in
the methods?
Page 5, Line 18: Start a new paragraph at “In order to fully…”
METHODS
Page 5, Line 54: Does this weight include roots or the leaves or the whole plant? Is it a wet
weight? If so, how did you control for differences in the amount of water on and in the plant?
Page 6, Line 3: Do not use the future tense, here or nearly anywhere else
Section 2.3: This section need the most work. The explanation of the experimental setup is
confusing and needs many more details related to how the experiment was run for 6 months.
What is a disc lake?
Page 7, Line 35: Remove “accurately”. Every measurement has error associated with it
Page 7, Line 43: Redefine enzyme abbreviations
Page 7, Line 45: Provide citations for the hydroxylamine method

What instrument were the activities measured on?
Section 2.6 – This is another section that needs a lot of work. Which statistical analyses were used
to test what? Describe all statistical analyses in this section.
RESULTS
Section 3.1
What does klx stand for?
How did you test for a significant difference? Please report the statistical method and the P-value
I am confused by the metric plant height increment. This was not explained in the methods
section
Biomass should be normalized to area. Is this biomass within the jars? If so, were the plants
destructively sampled? This also needs more explanation in the methods
Section 3.2
The sentence “IBR values reflect the comprehension responses to the stress of anoxia condition”
should be moved to the data analysis section (and the grammar should be checked). Instead,
since this is the results, the authors should describe the differences among treatments in these star
plots
How did the authors assess significant inhibition?
Section 3.3
Much of this section should be moved to the methods because it is simply describing how IBR
was used, and not what the results were.
DISCUSSION
How do you disentangle the impact of light intensity versus anoxic conditions?
Page 11, Line 37: This correlation is not shown in Figures 2A and 2B, but it is good to see some
reported regression values. What is the p-value of this relationship? It clearly is significant if it
explained so much of the variance
Were the raw data or was the median value used for the regression analysis?
Do not use the future tense. You are discussing work that has already been done.
Page 11, Line 54: “above ground” and “below ground” should both be one word (e.g.
“aboveground”)
Page 13, Line 18: This would be a good sentence to incorporate into the end of the abstract
because it does a good job of summarizing all of the results together
Page 14, Line 22: Define NP to nanoparticles
Page 14, Line 27: How did you assess “Well agreement”?

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Punidan Jeyasingh):
This manuscript reports results exploring the effects of hydrology on the performance of
Vallisneria. The manuscript was reviewed by two experts. Both of whom were enthusiastic about
the work (so was I during pre-assessment). Both reviewers raise several important issues that
need to be addressed. I felt the comments were fair and constructive. In addition, and more
importantly, the manuscript suffers from numerous grammatical issues. I urge the authors to
consult an English language editing service (or an Anglophone colleague) before resubmission.
This is a very nice piece of work that needs to be communicated more effectively. With much
gratitude to the expert reviewers, I invite the authors to make these revisions.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Punidan Jeyasingh):
The authors have done a great job of incorporating comments from reviewers. Consequently, this
version is much improved. I am happy with it, and would like to see it published. Nevertheless, I
urge the authors to give the grammar a bit more attention. For example, the first "sentence" of the
abstract is 5 sentences long! The newly added text throughout the manuscript is important. It
would help a lot if it is communicated more clearly. As such, I am recommending to accept this
manuscript, pending minor revision.

Appendix A
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Sincere thanks for the editor and reviewer’s comments concerning our
manuscript entitled “Integrated Biomarker Responses of submerged
macrophyte Vallisneria spiralis with the hydrological process from Lake
Poyang, China” (MS Reference No: RSOS-180729). Those comments are all
valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as the
important guiding significance to our researches. All authors have studied
comments carefully and have made correction according the Guidelines for
authors, abstract, introduction, method, results, discussion, conclusion and
figures, which we hope meet with approval. Revised portion are marked in
red in the paper. The main corrections in the paper and the responds to the
reviewer’s comments are as flowing:
Responds to the reviewer 1’s comments:
(1) Response to General comments
1) While the introduction does a good job of setting up the importance of the
study, the authors could do a better job of explaining what their predictions
or hypotheses were for the experiment.
Thanks for reviewer’s suggestion, we reorganized the introduction part and
put forward the hypothesis of this paper in time after introduction of the
current situation of wetland hydrological situation of Poyang Lake and the
ecological value of the representative wetland vegetation. As modified in the
last two paragraphs and other parts of the introduction, the paragraph
structure and parts of the content were also supplemented and revised.
Once again, thanks for your suggestion, which do make the Introduction Part
more reasonable and readable.
2) The methods need much more detailed information. Were the glass jars
(tanks?) outside, in a greenhouse, or indoors? Was water temperature
measured? Where was the water that was in the tanks from? At what
frequency did the authors add nutrients to the water? On what plant material
did the authors conduct the biomarker assays? Were plants destructively
sampled to determine biomass, or were they weighed while still wet? Etc…
The authors should write the methods so that a reader would have enough
information to exactly replicate the study.
We have made correction in the Methods Part according to the Reviewer’s
comments and listed some revision as following.
2.1 Experimental facilities and water exchange
After two weeks preculture and acclimation in laboratory with dechlorinated
municipal water adding Hoagland Nutrient Solution with proportion of 1:10
(Beijing Kolaibo Technology Ltd. Co.), well growth plants were rinsed with
tap water and distilled water, dried by filter paper. Uniform height samples
with 1.19 ± 0.12 gram (g) weigh and 10 ± 0.45 centimeter (cm) height
were chose as experimental materials and planted in sandy loam soil from
April to September, 2016. In order to simulate natural conditions, the whole
experiment was carried out outdoor in the field of YIFU experimental building
of Nanchang Institute of Technology (Nanchang, China). There was no
building blocking within 100 meters of the site, and an irrigation canal flow
through nearby brought from Fuhe river. As showed in Figure 2, the designed
plastic bucket with 10 ± 0.5 cm thick sandy loam soil at the bottom was
placed in a glass tank with length 50 cm × width 50 cm × height 100 cm.
The 12 strains of precultured V. spiralis were moved from laboratory into this
equipment. During the whole experiment, the water in tank was half
replaced to maintain water quality and transparency with dechlorinated
municipal water adding Hoagland Nutrient Solution with proportion of 1:10
(Beijing Kolaibo Technology Ltd. Co.) every week.
2.2 Definition of Disc Lake
In order to reflect the hydrological characteristics of Disc lakes where is
usually referred to the lower area separated from main water and formed as
an individual internal lake in dry season from National Nature Reserve in
Poyang Lake (Wu Cheng), the maximum water level in high water level group
(HWL), minimum water level in low water level group (LWL) and the average
monthly water level in normal water level group (NWL) were selected for
laboratory simulation.
2.3 Morphology and biomarker analysis
At the end of every month, three plants were taken in each parallel group
and rinsed with tap water and distilled water, dried by filter paper and
transported to the lab for physical measure. The morphological parameters
(plant height and biomass) of V. spiralis were then measured that plant
height was measured by measuring scale and the biomass was determined
by weighing method. The average height increment of vegetation is defined
as the difference of plant height between two adjacent months, and
calculated from subtracting the average height of plant in the next month by
the average height in the previous month. After that, leaves were cut
separately into small pieces to a size less than 1 mm by stainless steel
scissors, and then separately packed into polyethylene ziplock bag, marked
and numbered and then stored in the refrigerator at -40 °C for biomarker
assays.
Weighing 0.5 g of leaves, samples were fully ground within 9 volumes of cold
buffer (0.15 M KCl, 0.1 M Tris–HCl, pH 7.4) and centrifuged for 25 min
(12,000×g) at 4 °C. Supernatants were used as the extract for the content
of protein and enzymatic activity determination. Reagent Kits provided by
Nanjing Jiancheng Biological Technology co. Ltd were used for soluble protein
contents, enzyme activities analysis, including superoxide dismutase (SOD),
peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and lipid degradation product
(thiobarbituric acid, TBARS).
3) There is no explanation of which statistical tests the authors used beyond
generally stating that Excel was used. It is very important that the authors
choose the appropriate analysis for tests among groups, especially if the
data are not normally distributed.
Considering the reviewer’s suggestion, the detail of statistical tests was
added and listed as showing below. Once again, thanks for your suggestion.
In the present study, the growth of plant height, aboveground and
underground biomass, SOD, POD and CAT activities are combined into a IBR
comprehensive index after standardization. By this method, the comparison
between different experimental groups can be accessed and the visualization
results will be more acceptable. The data was counted by mean value ±
standard deviation SD. The differences between the groups were tested
using the LSD method in one-way ANOVA by IBM SPSS 22.0, in which
significant difference was indicated with p < 0.05 and highly significant
difference with p < 0.01. This study uses Microsoft Excel 2010 software to do
statistics and calculation of data. Adobe Photoshop CS6 and Corel DRAW are
taken for Image optimization.
4) I would also recommend that the authors pay particular attention to
improving the grammar in their manuscript. Notably, much of the manuscript
was written in the future tense. Given that this experiment was already
conducted, the authors should never use the future tense and instead use
the past tense (or present tense where appropriate).
Thanks for reviewer’s suggestion, the manuscript has been polished by
Elsevier for language problem. The certificated document and the revised
manuscript offered by Elsevier have also be presented at the same time.
(2)Response to specific comments
ABSTRACT
Line 2: Add “,China” after Lake Poyang
We have made correction according to the Reviewer’s comments.
Line 16-17: Do not use acronyms in abstracts without defining them
We have made correction according to the Reviewer’s comments.
End: Try to add a general sentence that brings all of the results (including
biomass, antioxidant enzyme activities, etc.) together into a main final
conclusion of the study -- Something like “We found that high flooding
levels had the strongest negative effect on growth and enzyme activity of
Vallisneria spiralis”
Considering the reviewer’s suggestion, a general sentence has been added
into this part for complete and clear representation.
INTRODUCTION
Page 3, Line 29: What do the authors mean by “As the energy source of
photosynthesis, rhythmic changes in wetland water level can effect….”? Do
they mean to say that water is affecting the light levels? The way the
sentence is written as of now it sounds like the authors are saying that water
is the energy source
Sorry for this grammar error, we have made correction according to the
Reviewer’s comments.
Page 4, Line 22: It would be helpful for there to be a map of where the lake
is in China, maybe in the methods?
Considering the reviewer’s suggestion, the basic elements, including China,
Jiangxi Province, Lake Poyang, Ganjiang River and several Disc Lakes, were
added and illustrated in Figure 1 as showing below.
Page 5, Line 18: Start a new paragraph at “In order to fully…”
We have made correction according to the Reviewer’s comments.
METHODS
Page 5, Line 54: Does this weight include roots or the leaves or the whole
plant? Is it a wet weight? If so, how did you control for differences in the
amount of water on and in the plant?
As mentioned above, we have made correction according to the Reviewer’s
comments.
Page 6, Line 3: Do not use the future tense, here or nearly anywhere else
We have made correction according to the Reviewer’s comments.
Section 2.3: This section need the most work. The explanation of the
experimental setup is confusing and needs many more details related to how
the experiment was run for 6 months.
As mentioned above, we have made correction according to the Reviewer’s
comments.
What is a disc lake?
We have added the definition in the Method Part according to the Reviewer’s
comments.
Page 7, Line 35: Remove “accurately”. Every measurement has error
associated with it
We have made correction according to the Reviewer’s comments.
Page 7, Line 43: Redefine enzyme abbreviations
We have made correction according to the Reviewer’s comments.
Page 7, Line 45: Provide citations for the hydroxylamine method
We have made correction according to the Reviewer’s comments.
What instrument were the activities measured on?
We have made correction according to the Reviewer’s comments.
Section 2.6 – This is another section that needs a lot of work. Which
statistical analyses were used to test what? Describe all statistical analyses
in this section.
As mentioned above, we have made correction according to the Reviewer’s
comments.
RESULTS
Section 3.1
What does klx stand for?
We have made revision in Result Part according to the Reviewer’s comments.
How did you test for a significant difference? Please report the statistical
method and the P-value
As mentioned above, we have made correction in the Method Part and added
P value according to the Reviewer’s comments.
I am confused by the metric plant height increment. This was not explained
in the methods section
We have added the definition in the Method Part according to the Reviewer’s
comments.
Biomass should be normalized to area. Is this biomass within the jars? If so,
were the plants destructively sampled? This also needs more explanation in
the methods
We have added explanation in the Method Part according to the Reviewer’s
comments.
Section 3.2
The sentence “IBR values reflect the comprehension responses to the stress
of anoxia condition” should be moved to the data analysis section (and the
grammar should be checked). Instead, since this is the results, the authors
should describe the differences among treatments in these star plots
Considering the reviewer’s suggestion, we have moved the sentence “IBR
values reflect the comprehension responses to the stress of anoxia
condition” to the data analysis section and made grammar revision.
Meanwhile, contents of the differences among treatments were also supplied
in this part.
How did the authors assess significant inhibition?
As mentioned above, we have made correction in the Method Part and added
P value according to the Reviewer’s comments.
Section 3.3
Much of this section should be moved to the methods because it is simply
describing how IBR was used, and not what the results were.
Considering the reviewer’s suggestion, much of this section has been moved
to the methods.
DISCUSSION
How do you disentangle the impact of light intensity versus anoxic
conditions?
Thanks for your kindly question. In fact, our research group in Nanchang
Institute of Technology has been keep deep cooperation with Jiangxi
provincial bureau of hydrology which is responsible for water quality
monitoring of Lake Poyang. Based on Monitoring Bulletin, concentration of
dissolved oxygen (DO) usually ranges from 7.05~8.66 mg/L within 5 meters
and its saturation rate ranges from 78.4~99.9 % at the permanent
observation stations in Lake Poyang. So, DO was not considered as a control
factor in this study and not be observed. Nevertheless, thanks to the
comments of reviewer, we will try our best to improve the experimental
proposal at the next stage of experiments.
Page 11, Line 37: This correlation is not shown in Figures 2A and 2B, but it is
good to see some reported regression values. What is the p-value of this
relationship? It clearly is significant if it explained so much of the variance
Considering the Reviewer’s suggestion, we have supplied corresponding
contents in this part and reorganized the paragraph structure as listed
following: There was a significant negative correlation with correlation
coefficient square R2 0.9666 between average light intensity under water
and average height of vegetation growth performed with a polynomial
regression analysis using Data from April to July (P < 0.001).
Were the raw data or was the median value used for the regression analysis?
As mentioned above, the average light intensity under water and average
height of vegetation growth were used in this part to perform regression
analysis.
Do not use the future tense. You are discussing work that has already been
done.
Sorry for this grammar error, we have made correction according to the
Reviewer’s comments.
Page 11, Line 54: “above ground” and “below ground” should both be one
word (e.g. “aboveground”)
Sorry for this grammar error, we have made correction according to the
Reviewer’s comments.
Page 13, Line 18: This would be a good sentence to incorporate into the end
of the abstract because it does a good job of summarizing all of the results
together
Considering the Reviewer’s suggestion, we have added a conclusion
sentence in abstract to make a final conclusion of all the results together.
Page 14, Line 22: Define NP to nanoparticles
Sorry for this grammar error, we have made correction according to the
Reviewer’s comments.
Page 14, Line 27: How did you assess “Well agreement”?
Thanks for reviewer’s suggestion. Firstly, IBR values of the treated group
were compared with that of the control group and sorted based on their
deviation degree. After that, qualitative analysis was made by numerous
single indicator of the experimental group to determine the adaptive effect of
IBR value.
FIGURES
Figure 1. Needs to have a scale and much more information about the device,
especially given that the water fluctuated.
Considering the reviewer’s suggestion, the figure has been revised by adding
scale and more detail.
Figure 2.
What is the random “5.29” doing in plot 2A?
Sorry for this grammar error, we have made correction according to the
Reviewer’s comments.
The standard deviation bars are remarkably consistent from month to month.
Are the authors certain that they calculated a separate standard deviation for
each month?
Thank you very much for your comments and we are so sorry for this error.
After inspection, we found that the standard deviation option in EXCEL was
checked automatically when plotting, which made the standard deviation
values showed in figure with same values.We have been carefully checked
and revised this error. Thanks again for your comments.
How did the authors test for significant differences?
As mentioned above, we have made correction in the Method Part and added
P value according to the Reviewer’s comments.
Figure 3
How did the authors test for significant differences?
As mentioned above, we have made correction in the Method Part and added
P value according to the Reviewer’s comments.
Figure 4
Make sure that text from separate plots does not overlap in the final figure
“CK” in the plots should be changed to “CG”
Thank you for your suggestions. This figure has been carefully plotted again
to make sure every elements clear illustration and no overlap. Furthermore,
“CK” was revised as “CG”.
Figure 5.
- The legend only needs to be shown once for all four panels, preferably to
the right of all four plots.
- The scale needs to be the same magnitude among all four panels (e.g.
Illumination intensity needs to go from 0 to 25 on all 4 plots)
- This is a really interesting figure!
Thank you for your suggestions. This figure has been modified with legend
shown once on the first panel to the right and the uniform magnitude among
all four panels.
Table 1.
- “may” need to be capitalized to “May”
Sorry for this grammar error, we have made correction according to the
Reviewer’s comments.

Check and revise.
We have made correction according to the Reviewer’s comments.
16. Tables 1, please supply an explanation in contents why this
experimentation only simulates 6 months, which is little different in
description as mentioned in introduction.
Thanks for your question. In Lake Poyang, V. spiralis began to mature in
October. Since then, the flower stalk of V. spiralis will be aged and
putrefaction gradually, and fruits will be gradually floated on the surface
water. Based on these considerations, our experiment was only conducted
until September.
17. The language used in this paper could be further improved by native
English speakers or professional English editing institutes.
Thanks for reviewer’s suggestion, the manuscript has been polished by
Elsevier for language problem. The certificated document and the revised
manuscript offered by Elsevier have also be presented at the same time.
We tried our best to improve the manuscript and made some changes in the

macrophyte Vallisneria spiralis via hydrological processes from Lake Poyang,
China" in Royal Society Open Science. All authors have studied comments
carefully and have made correction according the Guidelines for ethics
statement, data accessibility, competing interests, authors’ contributions,
acknowledgements, funding statement, and main documents grammars,
which we hope meet with approval. Revised portion are marked in red in the
paper. The main responds to the associate editor comments are as flowing:
Responds to the associate editor comments:
The authors have done a great job of incorporating comments from

Thanks for your recommendation and comments for the revised manuscript,
the manuscript has been further revised by all authors after several careful
inspections marked in red in the paper. Considering the reviewer’s
suggestion, the beginning of Abstract has been modified as following. Once
again, thanks for your suggestion.
Vallisneria spirals (V. spiralis), a widely distributed wetland plant, was used
to reveal how the light intensity at the top of the plant, plant morphology,
and antioxidant enzyme activity respond to different hydrologic conditions
from Lake Poyang, China. By designing a laboratory experiment simulating
historical water levels of low, normal, and high wetland plant submersion,
this study aimed to elucidate the effects of different levels of flooding on
growth and antioxidant enzyme activity for V. spiralis.
We tried our best to improve the manuscript and made some changes in the
manuscript. These changes will not influence the content and framework of
the paper. And here we did not list the changes but marked in red in the
revised paper. We appreciate for Editors’ warm work earnestly, and hope that
the correction will meet with approval.
