General remarks
This is an interesting and high-quality paper that I'm happy to recommend for publication.
However, I have found several minor problems and errors which are listed below. These need to
be corrected before acceptance. I also have one more substantial comment with regard to the
protocol used to carry out the phylogenetic analyses. Again, this needs to be addressed before
acceptance.
Specific comments
1. Line 23 - ‘…continents, but in the past they were distributed much broadly, being found also
on Eurasia, India and…’
3
Insert ‘more’ before ‘much broadly’
2. Line 74 - ‘…conducted. Considering that reliable phylogenetic framework are necessary to
conduct numerical
‘framework’ should be ‘frameworks’
3. Lines 99-103 - ‘The resulting matrix was analyzed under the parsimony criterion in TNT v. 1.1
[44] via an heuristic search with the following settings: 2000 replicates of Wagner trees, random
seed = 0, Tree Bisection Reconnection (TBR) for branch-swapping, hold = 20, and collapse of zero
length branches according to rule ‘1’ of TNT. The MPTs (most parsimonious trees) found in this
first round of the analysis were subject of a second round of TBR. A strict consensus tree, decay
(Bremer support) and resampling…’
This is not the best way to search for the most parsimonious trees and to collect all such
topologies. Instead, I recommend using the protocol proposed by Mannion et al 2013 in their
paper in zoological Journal of the Linnean Society en LusoTitan. In this paper, the authors
suggest first applying the new technology search in TNT. This has very efficient algorithms for
finding examples of the most parsimonious trees, but it will not necessarily find all or most the
the most parsimonious trees. Once this new technology search has been applied, the resulting
most parsimonious trees can then be used as the starting trees for the TBR search as outlined
above. The latter will help two find most or all of the remaining MPTs.
4. Line 125 - ‘…fully dichotomic topologies, the polytomies of the ‘original’ tree were manually
resolved by deliberately…’
‘dichotomic’ should be ‘dichotomous’
5. Line 130-131 - ‘…approach). Accordingly, each time sliced tree is composed of a subset of the
original tree containing taxa of the same age or older than the given period, added of the ghost
lineages of younger taxa.’
The phrasing is incorrect and confusing here.
6. Lines 182-179 - ‘…American/Malagasy podocnemidids (e.g. [5,20,25,27]). In order to test if
those different topologies imply in distinct ancestral area reconstructions, we ran a third set of
stratified analyses using the ‘molecular constrained’ tree see Results). Three time ranges with
their respective distance matrices were considered as thought to represent intervals with similar
landmasses configuration: 170-91.1, 91.1-55.5 and 55.’
‘in distinct’ should be ‘a distinct’
‘as thought’ should be ‘as they are thought’
7. Lines 247-248 - ‘…Cretaceous (figure 2). Other South America/Africa duplets are found during
this period, for example in Araripemydidae, Euraxemydidae, Podocnemidoidea, Cearachelyini,
and…’
‘duplets’ should be ‘pairs’
8. Lines 251-253 - ‘However, in the best fitted model, none of these joint distributions is favored,
making unlike that the descendant ranges are a result of vicariance [35,55]. Bothremydids most
probable ancestral area is…’
4
‘making unlike’ should be ‘making it unlikely’
9. Lines 314-316 - ‘Molecular divergence time estimates suggest that the evolutionary history of
Pleurodira begun in the Late Jurassic, between 165-150 Ma [4,5,75], but the oldest unequivocal
record of the group come from the Early Cretaceous (Barremian – c. 125 Ma) of Brazil…’
‘begun’ should be ‘began’
‘come from’ should be ‘comes from’
10. Lines 317-319 - ‘…Cretaceous and Cenozoic (figure 4). As suggested for tetrapods in general
[76], poorly sampling might explain the low Early Cretaceous phyletic diversity of Pleurodira,
especially taking into account…’
‘poorly’ should be poor’
11. Lines 334-335 - ‘…also be associated to the real diversification of Cearachelyini +
Bothremydini + Taphrosphyini (figure…’
‘associated to’ should be ‘associated with’
12. 360-361 - ‘…Miocene, we interpret the shift of diversification for this group as a real. Finally,
differently from the latter…’
Delete ‘a’ before ‘real’.
13. Lines 377-378 - Now, much more fossil pleurodires are known (e.g. [8,12–15,82]), providing a
more detailed account of…’
’much more’ should be ‘many more’
14. Line 442 - ‘Ours results also show that the most recent ancestors of Araripemydidae,
Euraxemydidae, and…’
‘Ours’ should be ‘Our’
15. Line 483 - ‘…other Testudines lineages and may represent a general trend for turtles.’
‘Testudines’ should be ‘Testudine’
16. Line 501 - ‘We are would like to thank E.A.B. Almeida, I. Werneburg and M. Rabi for
discussions and suggestions…’
Delete ‘are after ‘We’
17. Lines 752-753 - ’90. Sanmartín I, Ronquist F, Cunningham C. 2004 Southern Hemisphere
Biogeography Inferred by Event-Based Models: Plant versus Animal Patterns. Syst. Biol. 53, 216–

Double check the authorship of this paper - I was under the impression that it is just sanmartin

Almost there!. Great job fixing characters issues and creating the figures for the new ones.
However, I am skeptical that using a character-taxon matrix that has been slithly modified in the

obtaining the same parsimony indexes values CI, RI, HI. So please double check, I explain in

Dear Editor
Alice Power
Royal Society Open Science
I have completed the review of the manuscript RSOS-171773, entitled "Phylogeny,
biogeography and diversification patterns of side-necked turtles (Testudines:
Pleurodira)”.
I consider that this is an important contribution for understanding the evolution of
Pleurodira (side-necked) turtles. However, I found some issues and comments that I
hope the authors find useful and with the aim of improve the quality of their
findings.
1. The authors claimed that they define 23 new morphological characters.
However, most of these characters have been previously defined and used in
phylogenetic analyses, and in some cases the authors are just modifying their
definition (See the detailed comments on the Supplemental PDF attached).
2. Checking the character-taxon matrix that the authors created in Mesquite
and used for the phylogenetic analyses, I find some issues with the scoring
for some taxa, I provided photos of specimens at the end of the Supplemental
PDF to support my comments. This makes that the original “raw” data will
have to be updated it, and although I think the results won’t be impacted
drastically, the authors will probably have to run some of the analyses again.
3. The authors should include as supplemental data the Character-taxon Nexus
file created in Mesquite, if the journal does not support this type of files, they
could use any other platforms to do this, and provide the respective link.
Otherwise, their results can not be replicated and the value of their findings
and work will be minimum.
Based on these issues, my concept about this manuscript is that it needs major
revisions.
If the editors and authors consider appropiate, I am willing to review any improve
version of this manuscript in the future.
Sincerely yours,

44 21 1. Summary
45
46 22 Pleurodires or side-necked turtles are today restricted to freshwater environments of the Southern
47 23 continents, but in the past they were distributed much broadly, being found also on Eurasia, India and
48 24 North America, and marine environments. Two biogeographical hypotheses were proposed to explain this
25 distribution; in the first, vicariance would have shaped the current geographical distribution and, in the
49
26 second, extinctions constrained a previously widespread distribution. Here, we aim to reconstruct
50 27 pleurodiran biogeographic history and diversification patterns based on a new phylogenetic hypothesis
51 28 recovered from the analysis of the largest morphological dataset yet compiled for the lineage, testing
52 29 which biogeographical process prevailed during its evolutionary history. The resulting topology generally
53 30 agrees with previous hypotheses of the group and shows that most diversification shifts were related to
54 31 the exploration of new niches, e.g. littoral or marine radiations. In addition, as other turtles, pleurodires do
55 32 not seem to have been much affected by neither the K/Pg nor the Eocene-Oligocene mass extinctions. The
56 33 biogeographic analyses highlight the predominance of both anagenetic and cladogenetic dispersal events
57 34 and support the importance of transoceanic dispersals as a more common driver of area changes than
58 35 previously thought, agreeing with previous studies with other lineages.

39 2. Introduction
10 40 The turtle crown-group Testudines is composed of two lineages with extant taxa [1], cryptodires or
11 41 hidden-necked turtles, and pleurodires or side-necked turtles. Although early studies (e.g. [2,3]) proposed
12 42 a Triassic origin for the group more recent analyses suggest a maximum age of c. 165 Ma (Middle
13 43 Jurassic) for Testudines [4,5]. Stem-pleurodires are known from Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous
14 44 deposits [6], but the oldest records of the crown-group come from the Barremian (Early Cretaceous) of
15 45 Brazil [7,8].
16 46 Pleurodires represent today a small fraction of Testudines diversity (93 out of 356 species; [9])
17 47 and are restricted to freshwater environments (although some chelids seem to tolerate higher levels of
18 48 salinity; [10,11]) of Africa, Australia, Madagascar, and South America [12]. Their fossil record, however,
19 49 reveals a much broader distribution, including Eurasia, India, and North America (e.g. [12–14]), as well
20 50 as taxa adapted to marine (at least coastal) environments (e.g. [15,16). The crown-group includes three
21 51 lineages with extant representatives, Chelidae, Pelomedusidae, and Podocnemididae, and three extinct
22 52 groups, Araripemydidae, Euraxemyidade, and Bothremydidae [12,13,17]. Podocnemididae and
23 53 Bothremydidae are by far the most abundant pleurodires in the fossil record, and a proposed peak in
24 54 Pleurodire diversity during the Cretaceous and Paleocene seems to be related to the diversification of
25 55 those two groups [12].
26 56 The biogeographic distribution of extant pleurodires, which are restricted to the southern
27 57 hemisphere, has been the subject of many investigations. A classical viewpoint (e.g. [18,19]) is that the
28 58 disjunct Pelomedusoides distribution represents the outcome of vicariant events, in this case caused by the
29 59 breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana. Contrary to those interpretations, Noonan [20], using a
30 60 phylogenetic hypothesis based on molecular data combined with that of Meylan [21] for fossil taxa,
31 61 suggested that the distribution of extant pelomedusoids is relictual from a much more widespread pattern,
32 62 shaped by large-scale extinctions. Later, Romano & Azevedo [22], based on a re-analysis of the
33 63 morphological data-matrix of de la Fuente [23], adding more fossil taxa, corroborated the idea of vicariant
34 64 events shaping the biogeography of pelomedusoids. As for chelids, even though molecular (e.g. [5,24–
35 65 28]) and morphological (e.g. [17,29,30]) results disagree regarding the position of the Australian and
66 South American taxa, both hypotheses return similar biogeographic interpretations, where the group starts
36
67 to diversify prior to the separation of Australia from the remaining of Gondwana, suggesting a
37 68 widespread distribution for the group before this vicariant event [31,32].
38
39 69 The above mentioned studies were, however, conducted prior to several fossil findings that
40 70 greatly increased our knowledge of pleurodiran taxonomic, morphological, and distributional diversities
41 71 (e.g. [8,14,16]). Additionally, although some large phylogenetic analyses have been conducted (e.g. [12–
42 72 14]), sampling a variety of fossil taxa, these were restricted to some pleurodiran subclades, and no
43 73 phylogenetic analysis including a comprehensive sample of all lineages of the group has been so far
44 74 conducted. Considering that reliable phylogenetic framework are necessary to conduct numerical
75 diversity and biogeographic analyses [33–35], a well-sampled phylogenetic hypothesis for Pleurodira is
45
76 needed to test the previously proposed evolutionary scenarios.
46
47 77 In order to fulfill the above mentioned requirement, we compiled the largest morphological
48 78 matrix including a broad taxon sample of all pleurodiran lineages, obtaining the most inclusive
49 79 phylogenetic hypothesis so far proposed for the clade. Based on this new hypothesis, we conducted
50 80 diversification and historical biogeography analyses to explore the evolution of the side-necked turtles.

55
56 83 3.1. Phylogenetic analyses and time-scaled trees
57 84 A new taxon-character matrix (101 OTUs x 245 characters) for Pleurodira was built using Mesquite v. 3.0
58 85 [36]. The character list is largely based on the extensive studies of Gaffney et al. [12,13], with additions
59

3 86 from other sources [14,23,37–42], especially those focusing on chelids [17,29,43], and twenty-three new
4 87 characters proposed here. Special effort was made to better sample post-cranial structures, resulting in 97
5 88 characters from that partition (39.5% of the total), more than in any previous study (e.g., [12] and [14]
6
89 had 29.7% and 36.4% of post-cranial characters, respectively). Twelve characters were interpreted as
90 forming morphoclines and ordered accordingly (see electronic supplementary material for additional
7 91 information about the phylogenetic analysis).
8
9 92 The taxon sample was conceived to incorporate all pleurodiran lineages, namely Chelidae,
10 93 Pelomedusidae, Araripemydidae, Euraxemydidae, Bothremydidae, and Podocnemididae, including 98
11 94 crown-pleurodirans as terminal taxa (see electronic supplementary material for the complete taxon list).
12 95 Previously, the largest matrices for pleurodires comprised 43 [8] and 91 [14] ingroup taxa (although the
13 96 latter study employed a reduced version, with 70 ingroup taxa, in the main analyses). The non-Testudines
14 97 Testudinata Proganochelys questendti and the stem pleurodires Notoemys laticentralis and Platychelys
98 oberndorferi composed the outgroup.
15
16 99 The resulting matrix was analyzed under the parsimony criterion in TNT v. 1.1 [44] via an
17 100 heuristic search with the following settings: 2000 replicates of Wagner trees, random seed = 0, Tree
18 101 Bisection Reconnection (TBR) for branch-swapping, hold = 20, and collapse of zero length branches
19 102 according to rule ‘1’ of TNT. The MPTs (most parsimonious trees) found in this first round of the analysis
20 103 were subject of a second round of TBR. A strict consensus tree, decay (Bremer support) and resampling
21 104 (bootstrap and jackknife) values were obtained using implemented functions on TNT. The resampling
22 105 values were calculated using 1000 replicates for absolute and difference of frequencies (GC in [45]).
23 106 Consistency and Retention indexes were calculated using the script statsall (designed by Peterson L.
107 Lopes, v. 1.3). The IterPCR script [46] was used to identify unstable taxa during preliminary analyses
24
108 (i.e. taxa with multiple alternative positions) and to reevaluate our codings when the instability was
25 109 caused by conflict of information rather than missing data. Additionally, considering that molecular based
26 110 phylogenetic analyses retrieve distinct arrangements for several extant taxa (e.g. [20,24,25,27]), we ran a
27 111 second analysis (referred hereafter as the ‘molecular constrained’ analysis), following the same settings as
28 112 the previous (referred hereafter as the ‘original’ analysis), except for setting constraints (see the electronic
29 113 supplementary material) for the relations of the extant taxa based on the molecular phylogenetic
30 114 hypothesis of Guillon et al. [25]. We also conducted three additional constrained analyses to evaluate how
31 115 many steps were needed to achieve arrangements found in other alternative hypotheses.
32
116 In addition to the ‘original’ and ‘molecular constrained’ trees, we obtained two additional
33
117 topologies to be employed in the subsequent analyses. The ‘non-marine taxa tree’ was built for the
34 118 biogeography analyses by pruning taxa previously considered marine or adapted to brackish water, i.e.
35 119 Bothremydini and Stereogenyini [12,15,16,47], from the strict consensus tree of the ‘original’ analysis.
36 120 Further, the ‘supertree’ was built for the diversity and diversification analyses by adding extinct and
37 121 extant taxa not included in the ‘original’ phylogenetic analysis to its strict consensus tree. The four
38 122 topologies were time-scaled with the R [48] package strap [49], using information from the literature to
39 123 define time ranges for each taxon (see the electronic supplementary material) and dividing branch lengths
40 124 equally along the tree to avoid zero or close-to-zero values [50]. As the biogeographic analysis requires
41 125 fully dichotomic topologies, the polytomies of the ‘original’ tree were manually resolved by deliberately
42 126 choosing particular arrangements (see the electronic supplementary material for additional topologies).
43
127 3.2. Diversification analysis and diversity curves
44
45 128 The diversification analyses were conducted on the software SymmeTree [51] using time-sliced trees,
46 129 according to the procedure presented by Tarver & Donoghue [52] (but see [53] for an alternative
47 130 approach). Accordingly, each time sliced tree is composed of a subset of the original tree containing taxa
48 131 of the same age or older than the given period, added of the ghost lineages of younger taxa. Seven
49 132 different intervals were created: Early Cretaceous, Late Cretaceous, Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene,
50 133 Miocene, and Pliocene-Recent. Still, we followed the procedure outlined in Bronzati et al. [54] when a
51 134 diversification shift was detected in a time interval younger than the clade it is referred to, in order to
52 135 differentiate real shifts (i.e. detected shifts caused by diversification) from artifacts (i.e. detected shifts
136 resulting from speciation and extinction). We conducted two analyses, one with the ‘original’ tree and a
53
137 second with the ‘supertree’, in order to evaluate the effect of the sampling of our matrix in the resulting
54 138 shifts.
55
56 139 We also built two types of diversity curves across geological time for natural (i.e. clades) and
57 140 artificial (i.e. ecological guilds) groups of Pleurodira, to compare the diversity variation with
58 141 biogeographic and climatic events. In this procedure, we used the ‘supertree’ to increase our sample.

2
3 142 ‘Taxic diversity curves’ were obtained using the total number of taxa per time bin. Considering that this
4 143 kind of data is much affected by the incompleteness of the fossil record and the number of fossiliferous
5 144 deposits on a given period, a second type of curve was created for comparison, called ‘phyletic diversity
6
145 curve’, that also takes into account the number of ghost lineages in each of the intervals.
7 146 3.3. Estimation of ancestral ranges and number and types of biogeographical
8 147 events
9
10 148 We conducted a series of ancestral area reconstructions on the R package BioGeoBEARS, which
11 149 implements three of the most used models in historical biogeography analyses in a common likelihood
12 150 framework [55], namely LAGRANGE Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis (DEC) model [34,56], a
13 151 likelihood version of DIVA (DIVALIKE) [57], and a likelihood version of the range evolution models
14 152 (BAYAREA) implicit to the methods BayArea [58] and Bayesian Binary Model (BBM) of RASP [59].
15 153 Each of those methods makes different assumptions about anagenetic and cladogenetic range change
16
154 processes [35] and those assumptions usually have a large impact on the results [60]. The multimodel
155 approach implemented in BioGeoBEARS allows the evaluation of competing hypotheses potentially
17 156 generated by those models by comparing the fit of their assumptions to the observed data [55,60]. In order
18 157 to compare and choose between the different models, we conducted a Likelihood Ratio Test (TRT) for the
19 158 nested models and the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for sample size (AICc) for the non-nested
20 159 models.
21
22 160 We ran a first set of time-stratified analyses using a time-scaled version of the ‘original’ tree,
23 161 accounting for nine models: the standard models (herein named M0) DEC, DIVALIKE, and BAYAREA
24 162 [55], and two additional versions to each of those including x [61] and j [60] as free parameters (herein
163 named M1 and M2, respectively). The x parameter is used to estimate the relative probability of dispersal
25
164 as a function of distance, modifying the dispersal rates from area A to area B by (distance[A to B])x [61].
26 165 The distances between the areas are established by user-defined matrices (see the electronic
27 166 supplementary material). When x is set as a free parameter, the distance between the areas may influence
28 167 each branch on the tree differently. With j as a free parameter, founder-event speciation is added to the
29 168 model, allowing that – during cladogenesis – one of the descendants jumps to a new range outside that of
30 169 the ancestor without prior range expansion [60].
31
32 170 Considering that marine taxa are not affected by the oceanic barriers that separate continental
33 171 areas as terrestrial or freshwater turtles are, distances may influence differently their dispersal capabilities
172 and jumps to new areas without prior range expansion may not be uncommon. This justifies testing the
34
173 influence of x and j in additional models [55,62]. Since marine taxa are usually excluded from
35 174 biogeographic inferences (e.g. [63]), we ran a second set of stratified analyses using the ‘non-marine taxa’
36 175 tree for comparison. Moreover, phylogenetic hypotheses for pleurodires using molecular data usually
37 176 result in different arrangements for Australian/South American chelids and South American/Malagasy
38 177 podocnemidids (e.g. [5,20,25,27]). In order to test if those different topologies imply in distinct ancestral
39 178 area reconstructions, we ran a third set of stratified analyses using the ‘molecular constrained’ tree. The
40 179 two latter sets of analyses were conducted using only the nested models (M0, M1 and M2) of DEC and
41 180 DIVALIKE, because BAYAREA performed worse than those for the first set (see Results).
42
181 Three time ranges with their respective distance matrices were considered as thought to represent
43
182 intervals with similar landmasses configuration: 170-91.1, 91.1-55.5 and 55.5-0 Ma. We considered ten
44 183 possible areas: South America, Africa, North America, Madagascar, Australia, Europe, India,
45 184 Arabia/Middle East, East Asia, and Antarctica. Even though there is no record of pleurodires in
46 185 Antarctica it could act as a land bridge between closely related areas in some time bins and, as such, could
47 186 appear as a reconstructed ancestral area. Three distance matrices between the areas were defined, one for
48 187 each time-slice.
49
50 188 We also conducted biogeographical stochastic mapping (BSM) implemented in BioGeoBEARS
51
189 [64] on the ‘original’ tree dataset, using M1 and M2 models of DIVALIKE and DEC, to evaluate the
190 impact of a given model on the estimated frequencies of each type of range change event. BSM simulates
52 191 possible biogeographic histories constrained to produce the observed data of a given dataset, estimating
53 192 the times and position of all events on the tree [65]. Means and standard deviations of event counts from
54 193 50 BSM were used to estimate event frequencies.

195 4. Results
5 196 4.1. Phylogenetic analyses
6
7 197 Thirty-six most parsimonious trees (MPTs) of 1129 steps (CI = 0.290, RI = 0.749) were found by the
8 198 unconstrained analysis of the ‘original’ matrix. Bremer support (BS), Bootstrap and Jackknife values, lists
9 199 of characters and common synapomorphies, as well as phylogenetic definitions for the clades and a more
10 200 detailed description of the results are provided in electronic supplementary material. The strict consensus
11
201 tree (figure 1) is well resolved (93% of the possible nodes) and mostly agrees with previous morphology
202 based analyses, recovering the monophyly of the main pleurodiran lineages with high support. The
12 203 ‘constrained’ analysis found 756 MPTs of 1175 steps. Even if much longer, the resulting strict consensus
13 204 tree is very similar to the ‘original’ (see the electronic supplementary material), with the exception of the
14 205 forced relations between extant taxa.
15
16 206 4.2. Diversification shifts and diversity levels
17
18 207 The diversification analyses of the ‘original’ tree and the ‘supertree’ recovered nearly the same shifts (see
208 the electronic supplementary material), increasing their support. Shifts in three clades were recovered in
19
209 all periods subsequent to time bin 1, Early Cretaceous (figure 2): Pleurodira (also in time bin 1),
20 210 Podocnemidoidea, and the clade including Cearachelyini + Bothremydini + Taphrosphyini. On time bin
21 211 3, Paleogene (figure 3), two shifts were recovered: one for the clade including Erymnochelys
22 212 madagascariensis and Neochelys arenarum, but not Peltocephalus dumerilianus, and another for the
23 213 clade Peiropemydidae + Podocnemididae. The latter is also seen in all subsequent time bins, but the
24 214 former is restricted to time bins 3 and 4. Three new shifts appear in time bins 6 and 7, one for the
25 215 Stereogenyini clade including Bairdemys venezuelensis and Stereogenys cromeri, but not “Bairdemys”
26 216 healeyorum, and two within Chelidae, one for Chelini and another for the clade including all chelids, but
27 217 Emydura macquarii.
28 218 The taxon diversity curves for Pleurodira show little perturbation, with an increasing diversity
29 219 during the Early Cretaceous, a peak during the Campanian and Maastrichtian, a slight drop during the
30 220 early Paleocene, and a fast recovery by the end of this period (figure 4). This pattern is replicated in the
31 221 curve for Pelomedusoides, whereas Chelidae shows the Early Cretaceous increase followed by a relative
32 222 stasis (figure 4), which is surely a consequence of its poor fossil record. The contrast between
33 223 Bothremydidae and Podocnemidoidae (figure 4) reveals a higher and increasing diversity of the former
34 224 from the Aptian to the Campanian, decreasing afterwards until its extinction during the early Eocene.
35 225 Although the first records of Podocnemidoidae also extends back to the Aptian, its diversity remains low
36 226 during most of the Cretaceous, to rise more quickly after the Santonian, with a peak from the late
37 227 Paleocene to the Miocene, when it also starts to decrease (figure 4). Lastly, the contrast between the
38 228 freshwater and littoral/marine taxa (figure 4) shows a predominance of freshwater forms, with a curve
39 229 almost identical to that of Pleurodira, except for the Campanian peak that results from accounting the
230 marine taxa. The diversity curve of littoral/marine pleurodires reflect the Bothremydini and
40
231 Taphrosphyini diversification, beginning in the Late Cretaceous, and decline after the Campanian, but it
41 232 rises again from the late Eocene to the Miocene (figure 4) with the diversification of Stereogenyini.
42
43 233 4.3. Biogeographical analysis
44
45 234 The LRT showed that M2 models were the best-fitted across all three alternative topologies (table 1; see
46 235 the electronic supplementary material). AIC model selection supports DIVALIKE- M2 in all cases
47
236 (although DEC- M2 also performs well), stressing the power of cladogenetic range changes, i.e.,
237 vicariance and jump-dispersal (table 2; [55]), in explaining our data (see the electronic supplementary
48
238 material). It is noteworthy that the inclusion of x as a free parameter improved model fit (table 1),
49 239 supporting that the distance between the considered areas distinctly affects the pleurodiran lineages. Also,
50 240 the inclusion of j as free parameter consistently improved fit in all models and topologies, suggesting that
51 241 a founder-event speciation is important to account for range changes in side-necked turtles.
52
53 242 Except for three nodes, i.e., Pan-Pleurodira, Pleurodira, and Platychelyidae, widespread
54 243 ancestors (i.e., ancestor occupying more than one defined area) are never favored in our M2 models (see
55 244 the electronic supplementary material). The African/Australian ancestral range for the Pleurodira node is
56
245 best supported (although with low probability; figure 2), whereas for Pan-Chelidae an Australian range is
246 favored. The most probable ancestral area for Pan-Pelomedusoides and Pan-Pelomedusidae is Africa,
57 247 whereas the ancestors of Pan-Podocnemididae likely dispersed to South America during the Early

3 248 Cretaceous (figure 2). Other South America/Africa duplets are found during this period, for example in
4 249 Araripemydidae, Euraxemydidae, Podocnemidoidea, Cearachelyini, and Hamadachelys + other
5 250 Podocnemidoidae (figures 2 and 3), and two also during the Late Cretaceous, i.e. Podocnemididnae +
6
251 Erymnochelyinae and the clade including Dacquemys and Stupendemys (figure 3). However, in the best-
252 fitted model, none of these joint distributions is favored, making unlike that the descendant ranges are a
7 253 result of vicariance [35,55]. Bothremydids most probable ancestral area is Africa and several dispersal
8 254 events occurred from there, e.g., to India (Sankuchemys + Kurmademys), Madagascar (Kinkonychelys
9 255 rogersi), South America (Cearachelyini), and Europe (Bothremydini).

11 256 The summary of the BSMs counts (table 2) shows that founder-event and vicariance represents,
12 257 respectively, 29.2% and 1.8% of all events under the DIVALIKE M2. On the other hand, under
13 258 DIVALIKE M1, vicariance accounts for 21.3%. All kinds of dispersal events (range expansion and
14 259 founder-events) represent 22.1% and 29.2% under DIVALIKE M1 and M2 models, respectively. The
260 summary of BSMs counts for DEC M1 and M2 models provides similar results (see electronic
15
261 supplementary material).

263 5. Discussion
21 264 5.1. Pleurodiran relationships
22
23 265 As previously mentioned, the analysis conducted here represents the largest (101 taxa/245 characters) and
24 266 most inclusive phylogenetic study so far conducted for side-necked turtles. The resulting arrangement of
25 267 the main lineages generally agrees with previous analyses (e.g. [12–14,21,23]), with some exceptions that
26 268 reveal taxa with unstable relationships. The major extant (Chelidae, Pelomedusidae, Podocnemididae)
27 269 and extinct (Araripemydidae, Euraxemyididae, Bothremydidae) lineages were mainly retrieved with
270 relations similar to those previously proposed, although some discrepancies are seen.
28
29 271 The long-necked chelids are united into the clade Chelina (for phylogenetic definitions see
30 272 electronic supplementary material), as in previous morphology based studies [17,29,30], whereas
31 273 molecular data studies suggest monophyletic Australasian and South American chelids instead [5,24–28].
32 274 Although seemingly more intuitive (but see below the discussion about ancestral area reconstructions),
33 275 this result could not be replicated in any morphological study, even with the expansion of character and
34 276 taxon samples seen here as well as in other studies [29,30,66]. Indeed, based on our data-matrix,
35 277 constraining South American and Australasian chelid clades resulted in 72 trees of 1162 steps, much
278 longer than the original MPTs. Nine synapomorphies support the long-necked Chelina clade and only half
36
279 of those are related to the cervical vertebrae. Thus, the morphological support for this clade is not
37 280 exclusively related to their long-necks. On the other hand, more recent molecular analyses have increased
38 281 the sample of chelid taxa and gene sequences with unchanging results [5,25]. Indeed, there seems to be
39 282 currently no objective reason to choose between those alternatives.
40
41 283 The position of Araripemydidae and Euraxemydidae (figure 1) forming the sister clade to
42 284 Pelomedusoides (sensu [1]), agrees with a proposal by Meylan [21] that has never been replicated since
43 285 then. Euraxemydids were retrieved inside Pelomedusoides in all other analyses, and Araripemydidae has
44 286 been alternatively placed outside that group [12,23], inside it and closer to Podocnemididae [8,67], closer
287 to Pelomedusidae [13], or even on the stem-lineage of Pleurodira [14]. Forcing Euraxemydidae closer to
45
288 Podocnemididae than to Araripemydidae or Pelomedusidae, resulted in a tree only two steps longer (1131
46 289 steps). Similarly, forcing Araripemydidae inside Pelomedusoides, alternatively closer to Pelomedusidae
47 290 or Podocnemididae, resulted in trees with 1133 and 1131 steps, respectively. Thus, although the position
48 291 of Araripemydidae and Euraxemydidae in our strict consensus tree (figure 1) is well supported, forcing
49 292 previous hypotheses does not result in much longer trees.
50
51 293 The position of Atolchelys lepida, the oldest known crown-Pleurodira, is also controversial. It
52 294 was retrieved inside Bothremydidae [8], or inside a clade with euraxemydids and Sokatra antitra [14].
53 295 Conversely, our results support both S. antitra and A. lepida as Pan-Podocnemididae (figure 1), but
296 forcing A. lepida inside Bothremydidae requires only one additional step. Indeed, new data is needed to
54
297 better evaluate the relations of this taxon.
55
56 298 Among Podocnemididae alternative arrangements have distinct biogeographical implications.
57 299 First, Caninemys tridentata was retrieved as the sister-taxon to the South American Cerrejonemys +
58 300 Podocnemis clade [68], in contrast to previous analyses that supported an Erymnochelyinae affinity

3 301 [13,14,41]. Another point of divergence between molecular and morphological datasets is seen for the
4 302 extant Podocnemis, Erymnochelys, and Peltocephalus. Molecular analyses [5,20,25,28,69] support the
5 303 arrangement Peltocephalus + (Erymnochelys + Podocnemis), whereas morphological data (including that
6
304 presented here) suggests that Erymnochelys and Peltocephalus are closer to one another than to
305 Podocnemis [7,13,14,21,37,38,41,67,68]. In almost all morphological analyses Erymnochelys and
7 306 Peltocephalus are sister-taxa, whereas here Peltocephalus is sister to Stereogenyini and Erymnochelys is
8 307 nested in a clade including other African and Europeans taxa (see also [7,68]). A close relationship
9 308 between Erymnochelys, Turkanemys, and Kenyemys was already suggested before (united in the so-called
10 309 Erymnochelys-group; [70–74]), but has never been recovered in a phylogenetic analyses. In addition,
11 310 Neochelys and Papoulemys were for the first time also included into that clade (figure 1). This
12 311 arrangement has important implications for biogeographic analyses as Erymnochelys is positioned closer
13 312 to an African-European rather than to a South-American group.
14
15 313 5.2. Diversification of side-necked turtles
16 314 Molecular divergence time estimates suggest that the evolutionary history of Pleurodira begun in the Late
17 315 Jurassic, between 165-150 Ma [4,5,75], but the oldest unequivocal record of the group come from the
18 316 Early Cretaceous (Barremian – c. 125 Ma) of Brazil [7,8]. The phyletic diversity in the last stages of the
19 317 Early Cretaceous is low in comparison to that of the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic (figure 4). As
20 318 suggested for tetrapods in general [76], poorly sampling might explain the low Early Cretaceous phyletic
21 319 diversity of Pleurodira, especially taking into account the much older molecular clock estimates for the
22 320 origin of the group. Nevertheless, the results of our analysis indicate that the two main pleurodiran
23 321 lineages, Pan-Chelidae and Pan-Pelomedusoides, did not experience diversification rates that significantly
24 322 differ from one another. However, the ghost lineages associated to Early Cretaceous taxa indicate that
25 323 they were already established during this period (figures 2 and 3).
26 324 Two diversification shifts have been recognized in the Late Cretaceous (time bin 2), one related
27 325 to the Podocnemidoidea clade and another for a clade within Bothremydidae. Because of the poorly
28 326 sampled Early Cretaceous fossil record, the shifts detected for time bin 2 could be artifacts. Indeed, the
29 327 Late Cretaceous fossil record of Podocnemidoidea is richer than that of other pleurodiran lineages,
30 328 including Chelidae. However, the phylogenetic position of Early Cretaceous taxa such as Prochelidella
31 329 cerrobarcinae and Araripemys barretoi indicates that a large number of non-podocnemidoidean
32 330 pelomedusoides and chelidae lineages were already present in the Early Cretaceous (figures 2 and 3).
33 331 Accordingly, as shifts are related to the balance of the tree, the appearance of further Podocnemidoidea
34 332 lineages during the Late Cretaceous is interpreted as indicating a higher rate of diversification of this
333 group related to other pleurodiran lineages, rather than as an artifact caused by the poor Early Cretaceous
35
334 fossil record. In any case, this diversification shift can also be associated to the real diversification of
36 335 Cearachelyini + Bothremydini + Taphrosphyini (figure 2).
37
38 336 The Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary does not seem to correspond to a critical period of
39 337 Pleurodira extinction or diversification (figure 4). With a few exceptions (e.g. Araripemyidae and
40 338 Galianemys), most lineages crossed the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary (figures 2 and 3), even with a
41 339 phyletic diversity reduction in some groups (e.g. Bothremydini). In this sense, the shift recovered for the
42 340 clade Peiropemydidae + Podocnemididae is here interpreted as a real pattern, rather than an artifact
43 341 caused by the extinction of lineages in previous intervals, especially given the relatively rich fossil record
342 of bothremydids in the early Paleogene. Finally, the K/Pg mass extinction does not seem to affect the
44
343 diversity of Pleurodira. Bothremydids experienced a decrease diversity in the Mesozoic to Cenozoic
45 344 passage, but this was already dropping after the Campanian and the trend continued until the Selandian
46 345 (figure 4), suggesting that other factors were related to this decrease. Our results add to those on the North
47 346 American turtle fauna (e.g.[77–79]) supporting the hypothesis that turtles were not much affected by the
48 347 end-Cretaceous mass extinction.
49
50 348 The Podocnemidoidea fossil record (~ 20-30 known taxa) during the Paleocene and Eocene is
51 349 also much richer than that of Chelidae (less than 5 taxa). However, only few lineages reach the end of the
52 350 Eocene, and there is so far no record of pleurodires in the first stage of the Oligocene (Rupelian – c. 34
351 Ma; figure 4). Yet, it is not possible to assert if this is related to sampling biases, or to the
53
352 Eocene/Oligocene extinction event [80] and the reduction of phyletic diversity in the Eocene associated to
54 353 the temperature decrease during the Eocene (e.g. [81]). The phyletic diversity curve, however, suggests
55 354 that pleurodires were not much affected by this event either (figure 4).
56
57 355 As for the Late Cretaceous, the three diversification shifts detected in the Miocene (Chelidae,
58 356 Chelini, and a clade within Stereogenyini) might be related to the low phyletic diversity of the previous
59

2
3 357 epoch, the Oligocene. Indeed, in the second stage of the Oligocene (Chattian – c. 25 Ma), the fossil record
4 358 of Pleurodira is composed solely by stereogenyins, and a pulse of diversification within this clade was
5 359 identified in the following time bin. Because the Oligocene lineages of Stereogenyini indicate the
6
360 presence of many of its subgroups already before the Miocene, we interpret the shift of diversification for
361 this group as a real. Finally, differently from the latter, diversification shifts for Chelidae and Chelini
7 362 might be artifacts of their poor fossil record in the Oligocene, in which no chelids are so far known,
8 363 therefore not affecting tree balance in the time bin preceding the Miocene.
9
10 364 5.3. Dispersal, not vicariance nor large-scale extinctions, drove the distribution of
11 365 pleurodires
12
13 366 Previous authors tried to explain the current biogeographic distribution of pleurodires based on two main
14 367 hypotheses. The first interpret the pattern as shaped by several vicariant events where Southern and
15 368 Northern South American pleurodires (e.g. [5,32,63,70]), Australian and South American chelids (e.g.
16
369 [70]), African/Malagasy and South American pelomedusoides (e.g. [8]), were all separated by the
370 formations of dispersal barriers such as oceans basins, volcanic activity areas [8] or a large desert dividing
17 371 South America into Southern and Northern parts [63]. In contrast, the second hypothesis is focused on
18 372 Pelomedusoides [19,20], proposing that their current distribution was a result of “large-scale extinctions”
19 373 that affected a once widespread group [20].
20
21 374 Those studies suffered from two main drawbacks. First, except for that of Joyce et al. [63], they
22 375 were conducted when fewer fossil taxa were known, or didn’t include fossil taxa at all [5]. For example,
23 376 the studies of Noonan [20] and Romano & Azevedo [22] included only eight and six fossil taxa,
24 377 respectively. Now, much more fossil pleurodires are known (e.g. [8,12–15,82]), providing a more detailed
378 account of past distribution patterns (e.g. [16,83]) and more accurate age for the cladogenetic events,
25
379 which largely influence the results of biogeographical reconstructions [33,84].
26
27 380 The second drawback is related to the theoretical and methodological turnover in historical
28 381 biogeographic analyses from a search for common patterns and causes to the reconstruction of ancestral
29 382 ranges with a broader consideration of several evolutionary processes, the event-based approaches
30 383 [34,35,55,57]. The latter approach became dominant in the last two decades [55], assigning costs to
31 384 evolutionary processes – e.g. vicariance, dispersal, and extinction – and considering biogeographic
32 385 patterns that minimize such total cost as optimal solutions [34]. Also, the advent of parametric approaches
33 386 allowed the incorporation of information other than only distribution and topology, such as branch lengths
387 and distance between areas, into complex models [5,34,55,61]. Finally, implementation of those models
34
388 in a common likelihood framework enabled the choice of best fitted models, and the test of competing
35 389 biogeographic scenarios [55,60].
36
37 390 Our analyses employed those recent methodological advancements on an up-to-date inventory of
38 391 fossil taxa, and the results do not support either of the previously proposed explanatory hypotheses for the
39 392 geographic distribution of pleurodires. In contrast, dispersal events are the dominant process underlying
40 393 range changes under the best model (tables 1 and 2). This result is clearly dependent on the model: under
41 394 M1 models (that exclude founder-events) vicariance accounts for a similar proportion of range changes
42
395 (table 2; see electronic supplementary material for additional results). This is expected, because every
396 model makes explicit assumptions about biogeographic processes and it has been shown that they largely
43
397 affect ancestral area reconstructions [55]. Fortunately, the implementation under a common framework on
44 398 BioGeoBEARS allows the comparison of competing models based on LRT to objectively choose the best
45 399 fitted for each dataset [60]. DIVALIKE M2 is clearly the best model for our data (table 1), so that we
46 400 consider its reconstructions (figures 2 and 3) as the best representations of pleurodiran biogeographic
47 401 history. Also, the BSM shows that dispersal events (including range expansion and founder-events)
48 402 occurred more commonly from South America to Africa and from Africa to South America, Europe, and
49 403 North America. This holds true even for M1 models (see electronic supplementary material), reinforcing
50 404 the high frequency of movements between those areas for pleurodires.
51
405 It is evident from the fossil record that, at least during the Cretaceous, pan-chelids and pan-
52 406 pelomedusoids were restricted to southern and northern Gondwana respectively [12,31,32,82], even
53 407 though we did not defined those as distinct areas for the analyses. We agree with Joyce et al. [63] that a
54 408 desert zone, the Botucatu Desert [85], is the more likely barrier preventing the expansion of the southern
55 409 Pan-Chelidae and the northern Pan-Pelomedusoides to one another’s areas, since our hypotheses suggests
56 410 that those lineages were already separated prior to the formation of the Paraná-Etendeka Volcanic
57 411 Province (ca. 137-127 Ma; [86]), considered a possible barrier by Romano & Azevedo [22], remaining
58 412 separated longer than the duration of that event. It is well recorded in the northern part of the Paraná

3 413 Basin, that desert conditions continued to prevailed after the volcanic event, as indicated by the aeolian
4 414 sandstones of the Caiuá Group [87]. The ancestral area reconstructions using the ‘original’ tree support an
5 415 Australian origin for pan-chelids, which dispersed to South America still during the Early Cretaceous.
6
416 Chelodina ancestors diverged from this South American lineage, dispersing back to Australia still during
417 the Early Cretaceous (figure 5). The ‘molecular constrained’ analyses also support a South American
7 418 origin for Pan-Chelidae (see electronic supplementary material) and all dispersal events between this area
8 419 and Australia are also reconstructed to the Early Cretaceous. Although the distribution patterns of several
9 420 other groups, including meiolaniid turtles [63,88,89], suggest that southern South America and Australia
10 421 remained connected via Antarctica through the entire Cretaceous [90], our data suggest that by the end of
11 422 the Early Cretaceous some kind of barrier prevented the dispersal of chelid turtles between those areas.
12 423 The southward movement of the Antarctic continent, reaching latitudes higher than 70°S during the
13 424 Aptian [91], may have been one factor limiting the presence of chelids in that continent, since turtles are
14 425 rarer at such high latitudes [63,92].
15
426 The analyses of the ‘original’ or ‘molecular constrained’ trees do not result in drastic changes in
16 427 chelid ancestral area reconstructions (see electronic supplementary material). It was previously supposed
17 428 that chelids had diversified prior to the breakup of southern Gondwana, if results delivered by molecular
18 429 analyses were favored, or that “extensive dispersal” occurred more recently, when favoring the
19 430 morphology based topologies [82]. However, as fossil chelids are found deeply nested inside Chelina
20 431 (figure 1), the divergence times between Australian and South American clades have been pushed back to
21 432 the Early Cretaceous and only two dispersal events are needed to explain their current geographical
22 433 distribution, both occurring prior to the separation of those continents (figure 2).
23
434 The biogeographic history of Pan-Pelomedusoides, in contrast, was dominated by the occurrence
24
435 of areas of endemism for each clade, with several dispersal events to other areas (figure 5). The exception
25 436 is Pelomedusidae, which was always endemic to continental Africa. Currently, some pelomedusids are
26 437 found in Madagascar, the Arabic peninsula, the Seychelles archipelago, and other small islands [9,93], but
27 438 the absence of fossil records other than very scarce and fragmentary remains in continental Africa [72]
28 439 preclude a more detailed account of the Pelomedusidae biogeographic history. Given the current data, we
29 440 hypothesize that Pan-Pelomedusidae were always restricted to the African continent, and only recently
30 441 dispersed transoceanically to those other areas.
31
32 442 Ours results also show that the most recent ancestors of Araripemydidae, Euraxemydidae, and
443 Pan-Podocnemididae originally inhabited Africa dispersing to South America during the Early Cretaceous
33
444 (figure 5). The ancestors of Podocnemidoidae remained in the latter region, whereas those of
34 445 Bothremydidae returned to the African continent. Bothremydids greatly diversified in this region (figure
35 446 2), but several taxa dispersed independently to other areas: at least once to Europe, India, Madagascar,
36 447 and back to South America, and at least three times to North America (figure 5). Our results highlight the
37 448 great dispersion capability of bothremydids in accordance to the inferred marine or littoral habits of these
38 449 pleurodires [16,47,63]. Bothremydidae was the most widespread group of side-necked turtles during the
39 450 Cretaceous and Paleocene, when they started to decline in diversity until their complete extinction by the
40 451 Ypresian (figure 4).
41
452 The Podocnemidoidae have also been more widespread during some periods (e.g. Paleocene to
42 453 Miocene), but our results show that, as bothremydids, they were mainly restricted to few areas from
43 454 which they dispersed to others (figure 5). The group was initially endemic to South America, but the
44 455 ancestors of Hamadachelys escuilliei and Erymnochelyinae dispersed to Africa respectively during the
45 456 Early and Late Cretaceous. The latter group greatly diversified in this continent, dispersing twice to
46 457 Europe and once back to South America during the Paleocene (figure 5). The latter event originated
47 458 Peltocephalus dumerilianus and Stereogenyini, which returned to Africa later. There are, however, almost
48 459 equal probabilities for a dispersal event including only the ancestor of P. dumerilianus (figure 3). In this
49 460 context, as with bothremydids and also in accordance to their inferred marine lifestyles [15,94,95],
50 461 stereogenyins would have dispersed several times out of Africa, to North America, South America, and
51 462 East Asia (figure 5).
52 463 Even excluding the marine/littoral adapted bothremydids and stereogenyins, our results suggest
53 464 several events of transoceanic dispersal during pleurodire biogeographic history. Except for those
54 465 lineages, which undertook long distance oceanic dispersals (e.g. from Africa to North America or East
55 466 Asia), all the other events occurred across relatively short distances. Africa and South American
56 467 exchanges do not occur after the Paleocene (except for Stereonyini) and other events are short dispersals
57 468 from Africa to Europe or Madagascar. This hints at the possibility that, even not usually occupying
58 469 brackish waters, pleurodires could tolerate transoceanic crossings, maybe carried out or rafted by ocean

3 470 currents. Oceanic dispersals may have been more common causes of biogeographic range changes than
4 471 previously thought, as already suggested for other groups such as tortoises [5,32], lizards [96],
5 472 amphibians [62], and even invertebrates [97]. For pleurodires this should not come as a surprise, given the
6
473 island distribution of some pelomedusids and chelids [9,93] and the results of a recent study [11], in
474 which Chelodina expansa and Emydura macquarii individuals were exposed to saline conditions for long
7 475 periods (50 days) without showing physiological problems.

477 6. Conclusions
13 478 Our phylogenetic hypothesis is the most inclusive and well-sampled ever proposed for extinct pleurodiran
14 479 turtles. Although pleurodiran relationships can be said to be stable due to the general agreement between
15 480 different hypotheses, some points of conflict still exist, especially between morphology and molecular
16 481 data. Our diversification analysis suggests that pleurodires were not much affected by the Cretaceous-
17 482 Paleogene and Eocene-Oligocene mass extinction events. This result agrees with patterns observed for
18 483 other Testudines lineages and may represent a general trend for turtles.
19 484 Chelidae and Pelomedusoides seem to have experienced similar diversification patterns,
20 485 although some pelomedusoid subclades did show higher diversification rates. Among those, an initial
21 486 diversification shift among Podocnemidoidea during the Early Cretaceous seems to be related to that of
22 487 bothremydids. In addition, the Peiropemydidae + Podocnemididae clade and one clade within
23 488 Stereogenyini respectively showed higher diversification rates during the Late Cretaceous and Oligocene.
24 489 Thus, most pleurodire diversification shifts seem related to the invasion of different niches, e.g.,
25 490 bothremydids and stereogenyins invading littoral or marine environments. Freshwater pleurodirans
26 491 apparently experienced steady diversification rates, whereas marine taxa peaked during the Late
27 492 Cretaceous and Oligocene-Miocene periods (figure 4).
28 493 The current distribution of pleurodirans cannot be fully understood using vicariance or large-
29 494 scale extinctions as sole explanations. Although those may have affected the observed patterns, dispersal
30 495 events seem to be the most important factor shaping the biogeography of side-necked turtles (table 2).
31 496 Although most dispersals occurred across relatively short distances, long distance dispersals were also
32 497 common, especially among the littoral/marine adapted bothremydids and stereogenyins (figure 5). As
33 498 such, our hypothesis adds to recent results (e.g. [62,96,97]) indicating that transoceanic dispersals may be
34 499 a much more common biogeographic event than previously thought.

Section 1: Phylogenetic definitions of pleurodiran clades
Pleurodira Cope, 1865
Definition (based on Joyce et al., 2004): Pleurodira refers to the crown-clade containing the last
common ancestor of Chelus fimbriatus (Schneider, 1783), Pelomedusa subrufa (Bonnaterre, 1789)
and Podocnemis expansa (Schweigger, 1812) and all its descendants.

Section 2: Unconstrained phylogenetic analysis
2.1. Detailed description of the procedures and results
The two stem-pleurodires included in our matrix, Platychelys oberndorferi and Notoemys
laticentralis, are grouped in the Platychelyidae clade (Fig. 1, S1), supported (BS = 4) by five
synapomorphies, including an articulation facet on the anterior margin of first thoracic rib (ch. 188)
and a fontanella between the hyo- and hypoplastra (ch. 226). The crown-group Pleurodira (BS = 6)
is diagnosed by eight synapomorphies, such as a closed foramen jugulare posterius (ch. 112) and
postzygapophyses of the cervical vertebrae elevated on the neural spine (ch. 164). Although
Chelidae has a low Bremer support (BS = 1), it is supported by twelve synapomorphies, including
the absence of the quadratojugal (ch. 15) and a concave lateral surface of the squamosal (ch. 38).
The South American chelids (Chelini; Fig. 1, S1) were grouped in a short- and a long-necked
clades, the latter including also the Australasian Chelodina colliei. The other Australasian chelids
are retrieved as successive sister-taxa to the South American clade (Fig. 1, S1). All extinct chelids
included here, except Chelus colombianus, were grouped in the same clade (BS = 1), sister to
Hydromedusa spp. (Fig. 1, S1), supported by a wider than long mesoplastra (ch. 225), pill-shaped
pubic scars (ch. 239), and two other synapomorphies.
The Australasian chelids, as in previous phylogenetic analyses based on morphological data
(e.g. Gaffney, 1977; Bona & de la Fuente, 2005; de la Fuente et al., 2017a), appear distributed as
successive sister taxa to the South American chelid clade (Chelini). The grouping of Hydromedusa
+ Yaminuechelys was supported by three synapomorphies in Bona & de la Fuente’s (2005) analysis
and here those same characters (ch. 73, 108, 157, and 174) plus the neural series extending to costal
8 (ch. 175) support the phylogenetic position of the extinct chelids herein. Previous studies
considered Bonapartemys bajobarrealis and Prochelidella cerrobarcinae more closely related to
Phrynops spp. and Acanthochelys spp., respectively (Lapparent de Broin & de la Fuente, 2001; de
la Fuente et al., 2011). A recent phylogenetic analysis (de la Fuente et al., 2017a) included
Bonapartemys bajobarrealis for the first time in a phylogenetic context, retrieved it nested within a
clade sister to that containing all extant chelids, contrasting to our results.
Pan-Pelomedusoides (BS = 3) is diagnosed by the absence of nasal (ch. 3) and splenial (ch.
133) bones, and eleven other synapomorphies. Araripemydidae (BS = 9) and Euraxemydidae (BS =
4) are grouped together as part of the stem lineage to crown Pelomedusoides. Both Pelomedusoides
(BS = 1) and Araripemydidae + Euraxemyidade (BS = 1) are supported by three synapomorphies.
Araripemydidae was previously recovered variably inside (Gaffney et al., 2011; Romano et al.,
2014; Menegazzo et al., 2015) or outside (Meylan, 1996; França & Langer, 2006; Gaffney et al.,
6
2006; Cadena, 2015) Pelomedusoides, but Euraxemydidae is almost always retrieved inside this
clade (except for Meylan, 1996).
As in all previous analyses (e.g. Gaffney et al., 2006, 2011; Cadena, 2015), no taxon is
recovered in the stem-lineage of Pelomedusidae, resulting in a large gap from the Barremian to the
first records of the extant taxa (Fig. 2). Sokatra antitra and Atolchelys lepida were recovered as
successive sister-taxa to Podocnemidoidea (Bothremydidae + Podocnemidoidae). The position of
Atolchelys lepida is still controversial: in the original description (Romano et al., 2014) this taxon is
retrieved as sister to all bothremydids and in a later analysis (Cadena, 2015) it is inside a clade also
including So. antitra and euraxemyidids.
The interrelations of Bothremydidae are problematic in two points. The first one is related to
the Kurmademydini clade (Gaffney et al., 2006, 2009; Rabi et al., 2012; Joyce et al., 2016), which
is not supported by our analyses (Fig. 1, S1). A paraphyletic “Kurmademydini” was already
retrieved by previous analyses (Romano et al., 2014; Cadena, 2015), but in these Kinkonychelys
rogersi and Kurmademys kallamedensis are grouped in a clade, whereas our result support the
former as closer to the other bothremydids. The second point of disagreement is related to the
position of Foxemydina which is alternatively closer to Bothremydini (Gaffney et al., 2006; Cadena
et al., 2012a; Rabi et al., 2012) or sister to the clade including Taphrosphyni + Bothremydini
(Cadena, 2015; Joyce et al., 2016). Our results agree with the former hypothesis with a good
support from morphological characters (Fig. S1-S6).
The crown-clade Podocnemididae (BS = 2) splits in two lineages, Podocnemidinae
including Podocnemis spp., Cerrejonemys wayuunaki and Caninemys tridentata, and
Erymnochelyinae, including all other podocnemidids (Fig. 1, S1). The position of Ca. tridentata,
from the Miocene of South America, is unusual, being previously recovered among
Erymnochelyinae instead (Meylan et al., 2009; Gaffney et al., 2011; Cadena, 2015). Several taxa
occur between the extant Erymnochelys madagascariensis and Peltocephalus dumerilianus. Even
though a Erymnochelys-group was proposed elsewhere (Broin, 1988; Lapparent de Broin, 2000a,
2000b. Pérez-García & Lapparent de Broin, 2015; Pérez-García et al., 2017) which would include
fossil taxa closer to Erymnochelys than to other extant podocnemidids, it was based solely on a brief
anatomical diagnose (“gulars are in contact posteromedially, and located posteriorly to a reduced
intergular that they frame”; Pérez-García et al., 2017), this was never supported by phylogenetic
analyses, which commonly group Erymnochelys and Peltocephalus as sister-taxa (Gaffney et al.,
2011; Cadena, 2015). The Erymnochelys-group, however, has a different composition than the
group retrieved here. Aside from Kenyemys williamsi and Turkanemys pattersoni (the latter
retrieved here as sister-taxa to Erymnochelys madagascariensis, Fig. 1, S1) it also included
7
‘Neochelys’ fajumensis, ‘Podocnemis’ aegyptiaca, and three Eocenochelus taxa, but excluded
Papoulemys laurenti (see below discussion about this taxon) and Neochelys (Pérez-García et al.,
2017). Here, both the later are also closer to Erymnochelys than to other extant podocnemidids. This
clade is supported by gular scutes with similar sizes to intergular (ch. 231) that reach the
entoplastron bone (ch. 234).
The European erymnochelyin Papoulemys laurenti was recently reallocated inside
Neochelys based on a redescription that identified common features between those taxa (Pérez-
García & Lapparent de Broin 2015). Unlike the Erymnochelys-group, this hypothesis was supported
by one phylogenetic analysis (Cadena, 2015). Here, however, Papoulemys laurenti is retrieved
closer to Kenyemys williamsi and ‘Neochelys’ fajumensis than to the included Neochelys taxa,
namely N. arenarum and N. franzeni. This is supported only by wider than long cranial margin of
intergular (ch. 242), while Neochelys is diagnosed by slightly elongated heart-like shaped
interparietal scale (ch. 27) and their position closer to Erymnochelys and Turkanemys than to
Papoulemys laurenti is supported by a foramen palatinum posterius restricted to the palatine (ch.
71) and neural series reaching costal plates 6 (ch. 175). Based on our analyses, to reallocate
Papoulemys laurenti into the same genus as Neochelys arenarum and N. franzeni would require to
do the same with Turkanemys pattersoni and Erymnochelys madagascariensis. Hence, we choose to
maintain the status of Papoulemys as a valid genus, with Papoulemys laurenti as its type and only
included species.
Finally, Peltocephalus dumerilianus is recovered as the sister-taxon to Stereogenyini
(Gaffney et al., 2011), supported by five synapomorphies, including an anterior pit on the ventral
surface of the premaxillae (ch. 46). This affinity was already hinted by a previous analysis (Ferreira
et al., 2015), that focused on Stereogenyini. The latter group includes Stereogenyita and
Bairdemydita clades (Fig. 1, S1), with Mogharemys blackenhorni, Cordichelys antiqua, Latentemys
plowdeni and “Bairdemys” healeyorum as successive sister-taxa to them.

Section 3: Constrained phylogenetic analysis results
3.1. Detailed description of the results
Although South American and Australasian chelids were forced to form clades (Fig. S7), the extinct
chelids maintain the same position as in the original tree (Fig. S8), with Chelus colombianus as
sister taxon to C. fimbriatus, and the other fossils grouped in a clade sister to Hydromedusa spp.
Araripemydidae, Euraxemydidae, Bothremydidae and non-Podocnemididae Podocnemidoidae taxa
maintain the same positions, but Sokatra antitra is in a politomy including Pan-Pelomedusidae and
Pan-Podocnemididae (Fig. S8). Erymnochelys madagascariensis is forced closer to Podocnemis
spp. than to Peltocephalus dumerilianus (Fig. S7), but the latter is still recovered as sister to
Stereogenyini, and Caninemys tridentata and Cerrejonemys wayuunaki form successive sister taxa
to Podocnemis spp as well (Fig. S8). Similarly, the taxa closer to E. madagascariensis (e.g.
Turkanemys pattersoni, Neochelys franzeni and Kenyemys williamsi) were again recovered in the
same clade (Fig. S8). On the other hand, Carbonemys cofrinii, Dacquemys paleomorpha,
Stupendemys geographicus, and UCMP 42008, recovered in a clade inside Erymnochelyinae in the
unconstrained analysis, were not grouped together and appear in a politomy with the other
podocnemidid clades (Fig. S8).

Section 4: Additional trees
4.1. Procedure to create fully dichotomic trees
The biogeographic analysis requires fully dichotomic topologies, hence, the polytomies of the
original tree had to be manually resolved by deliberately choosing an arrangement. However, some
considerations were taken in order to minimize the effect of arbitrariness related to this procedure.
As advocated by previous studies (e.g., Upchurch et al., 2015), one alternative is to define clades in
a way that the arrangement minimizes biogeographic changes (e.g. in a polytomy including two
taxa in one area and a third in another, we define the first two as sister-taxa in exclusion of the
latter). This was possible to be done for one case of the original tree ((Carbonemys cofrinii +
Stupendemys geographica) + (Dacquemys paleomorpha + UCMP 42008)). In cases when this was
not possible, two different procedures were conducted: (1) define the relationship based on previous
studies and never contradicted posteriorly (e.g. Foxemys mechinorum + Foxemys trabanti in
exclusion of Polysternon provinciale); or (2) using an arrangement found in one of the MPTs (e.g.
Sankuchemys sethnai + Kurmademys kallamedensis in exclusion of Kinkonychelys rogersi and
Bothremydini).

Section 5: Biogeographic analyses
5.1. Ancestral area reconstruction results and original outputs
Ancestral area reconstruction generally agrees between the best-fitted models (DIVALIKE-
M2 and DEC- M2), with important exceptions being the areas of four nodes, namely
Pelomedusoides + Araripemydidae, Araripemydidae + Euraxemydidae, Araripemydidae, and
Euraxemydidae. DIVALIKE- M2 favors an African distribution in all three topologies (Fig. 2),
whereas DEC- M2 favors South American ancestors (Appendix S2).
As expected, the probabilities for the alternative areas in the Pleurodira node are relatively
low, but an African/Australian distribution is best supported by DIVALIKE-M2, and
African/Australian/South American distribution by DEC-M2. For the Pan-Chelidae node an
Australian distribution is favored and one dispersal event to South America occurred during the
Early Cretaceous. From this area the ancestors of Chelodina colliei dispersed back to Australia
before the Aptian (Fig. 2).
Pan-Pelomedusoides were distributed in Africa (Fig. 2, 3), with Pan-Pelomedusidae
remaining in this continent, while its sister-clade, Pan-Podocnemididae, dispersed to South America
during the Early Cretaceous. Other South America/Africa duplets are found during this period, for
example in Araripemydidae, Euraxemydidae, Podocnemidoidea, Cearachelyini, and Hamadachelys
+ other Podocnemidoidae (Fig. 2, 3). However, in none of these cases a joint distribution is favored
in the M2 models, making it unlike that the descendant ranges are a result of vicariance in the best-
fitted model (Ronquist & Sanmartín, 2011; Matzke, 2013). Bothremydids most likely originated in
Africa and experienced several dispersal events from this area. Still during the Early Cretaceous the
ancestor of the clade Sankuchemys + Kurmademys jumped to India and Kinkonychelys rogersi to
Madagascar, while the Cearachelyini and Bothremydini ancestors dispersed, respectively, to South
America and Europe. From the latter area, bothremydinis dispersed back to Africa and from there to
North America twice during the Late Cretaceous, in the Chedighaii + Bothremys and in B. cooki +
B. maghrebiana nodes (Fig. 2). A third dispersal event to North America occurred later by the end
of the Cretaceous, when Taphrosphys sulcatus reached this area from the African Taphrosphyini
ancestors (Fig. 2).
Two additional South America/Africa duplets occurred in the Podocnemididae clade. The
Podocnemidinae node maintained the South American distribution while the ancestor of
Erymnochelyinae dispersed to Africa, as did that of Dacquemys paleomorpha + UCMP 42008, both
during the Late Cretaceous (Fig. 3). During the Paleogene podocnemidids experienced a series of
dispersal events from African ancestors, with Neochelys franzeni + Neo. arenarum and Papoulemys
63
laurenti jumping to Europe, Erymnochelys madagascariensis to Madagascar, and Peltocephalus
dumerilianus to South America. By the end of the Eocene and during the Oligocene, the
Stereogenyini (similarly to the Bothremydini) experienced at least four dispersal events from
African ancestors to North America, Asia (twice) and South America (Fig. 3).
Removing the marine taxa (Appendices S5, S6) from the analyses did not alter the results
described above, except for the Bothremydidae node, which is estimated as distributed in
Madagascar during the Early Cretaceous. On the other hand, the analysis of the ‘molecular
constrained tree’ showed noteworthy differences (Appendices S7, S8). The Pan-Chelidae ancestor
occupied the South American continent and from there, the ancestor of all Australian chelids
dispersed to this area still during the Early Cretaceous. The different arrangements of
Erymnochelys, Peltocephalus, and Podocnemis also affected the ancestral area reconstructions. The
clade including Erymnochelys but not Podocnemis nor Peltocephalus dispersed from South
America to Europe during the Late Cretaceous and from there to Africa by the end of this period.
Also at this time, Erymnochelys ancestor jumped to Madagascar and it is restricted to this
subcontinent since then. The clade including Peltocephalus and Stereogenyini, but not
Erymnochelys nor Podocnemis were distributed in South America, instead of Africa as for the
original tree analysis (Fig. 3). From these areas, Stereogenyini dispersed to Africa during the
beginning of the Paleocene and then to the other areas during the Eocene and Oligocene.

Supplemental Information 2. An illustrated guide of morphological characters for
turtles of the clade Pleurodira (Testudines: Pan-Pleurodira) turtles.
Introduction
The body plan of turtles can be considered as a unique masterpiece in vertebrate
evolution, by its particular anatomy and physiology (see (Hirasawa et al. 2013; Hirasawa
et al. 2014; Lyson et al. 2014) references therein). The turtle skeleton is formed by a
cranium (skull, lower jaw, and hyoid apparatus) composed of approximately 46 bones
and 282 axial skeletal bones (including limbs, neck, tail, pelvic and pectoral girdles,
carapace and plastron)(Pritchard 2008). This complex anatomical configuration and all its
possible variations in shape and number of bones are related not only to lineages
diversity, but also to environmental, climatic, and geographical adaptations through out
their almost 229 Ma of evolution; making the reconstruction of turtles evolutionary
history and their phylogenetic relationships a challenging labor for biologists and
paleontologists. Labor that can be even more tedious if different authors work with
different morphological terminology and definitions to refer to the same structure or
features. A good example of this was recently discussed by (Rabi et al. 2013), pointing
out how through years, different authors have used different names to refer to the same
carotid arteria foramina, creating not only confusion and misunderstanding, but also
erroneous scoring in phylogenetic studies.
In order to set up a common and practical morphological terminology, not only for
researchers in the field of turtle morphology, taxonomy, and phylogenetics, but also for
students and future turtle researchers. I present here an illustrated guide of morphological
characters with importance for phylogenetic studies of Pan-Pleurodira, principally
Bothremydidae and Podocnemididae clades, based on the compilation, modification, and
discussion of previous studies (see Session 1 below for references and abbreviations), as
well as new insights from direct examination of a good number of specimens (See Supp.
Inf. 3, list 1). Panpleurodires or side-necked turtles includes a highly diverse group of
extant and extinct turtles, currently restricted to freshwater environments of the southern
hemisphere (South America, Africa, Madagascar, and Australia), but globally spread
during the Cretaceous and most of the Cenozoic (Cadena & Joyce 2015; Cadena et al.
2012a; Gaffney et al. 2011;2006).
Guide organization
This guide is organized in two main sessions. The first one is a list of 187 morphological
characters, with their corresponding definitions, abbreviated reference(s) from where they
were taken, and remarks if they were reworded, reorganized, combined or any other
additional information or discussion. The second session corresponds to the graphical
component of this guide, for which each character is figured in 36 composite plates,
including all its possible character states, using a configured template in Adobe Illustrator
CS6 (Fig. 1, session 2 of this appendix), see also (Supp. Inf. 4, for compressed file
containing all .eps files for each character, facilitating modification of states or addition
of new characters by future studies)
Session 1. Characters list, description, and discussions.
Characters described here have been taken, modified or added from previous global
turtles or Pan-Pleurodira only studies or character lists (Bardet et al. 2013; Cadena 2010;
Cadena et al. 2012a, 2012b; Cadena et al. 2013; Cadena and Parham, 2015; Gaffney et al.
2006, 2011; Hirayama 1994,1998; Joyce 2007; Joyce et al. 2011; Kear & Lee 2006;
Lapparent de Broin 2000; Parham & Pyenson 2010; Pérez-García & Lapparent de Broin
2013; Sterli 2008; Sterli & de la Fuente 2013). Characters excluded from previous studies
are found at the end of the session, principally characters that represent exclusive
autapomorphies or represent redundant characters, reasons for exclusion are presented
there too. See also Supp. Inf. 2 for the NEXUS file containing the character-taxon matrix
for Pleurodira using the character list described below, as well as the changing in scoring
presented at the end of this session.

aperture, ending in a straight to convex edge. CA2 (ch 5); GF1 (ch 6). Remarks:
character reworded.
6. Prefrontals, prefrontal-palatine contact: 0 = present; 1 = absent. GF1 (ch 7); JY1
& STF (ch 6, Prefrontal C). Remarks: this character is visible in dorsal or lateral
views when orbital cavities are well preserved and free of rock matrix or without
strong crushing or deformation effect.
7. Prefrontals, prefrontal-vomer contact: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1 (ch 8); JY1 &
STF (ch 5, Prefrontal B). Remarks: this character is visible in sagittal cut of the
skull, limiting the scoring in many fossils.
8. Prefrontals, prefrontal-parietal contact: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1 (ch 10).
9. Prefrontals, interorbital groove at medial contact between prefrontals: 0 = absent;
1 = present. CA1 (ch 9); GF2 (ch 3); and LA (without number).
10. Prefrontals, prefrontal-frontal anterodorsal shape in lateral view: 0 = flat to
slightly convex; 1 = strongly convex. GF2 (ch 4).
11. Frontals-prefrontals, direction of the orbits in dorsal view of the skull: 0 =
laterally facing, with a very narrow to almost complete absent dorsal exposure of
the maxilla and jugal; 1 = dorsolateral facing, with portions of the maxilla and
jugal dorsally exposed. GF1 (ch 11).
12. Frontals, foramen interorbitale: 0 = high, circular to oval in shape; 1 = low, much
wider than height. GF1 (ch 12).
13. Parietal, parietal-quadratojugal contact: 0 = absent; 1 = short; 2 = long. GF1 (ch
13).
14. Parietal, temporal emargination in dorsal and lateral views: 0 = absent, complete
roofing of the fossa temporalis, with straight to slightly concave posterior margin
of parietals, squamosal, and supratemporal bones, keeping a very low posterior
skull, compared to the orbital region, observed in lateral view; 1 = intermediate,
partial roofing of the fossa temporalis, with concave to straight posterior margin
of parietals and squamosal bones, covering partially the otic chamber, slightly
higher posterior portion of the skull, compare to the orbital region; 2 = extremely
reduced, almost complete roofing of the fossa temporalis, with slightly convex
posterior margins of parietals and squamosals, and much higher posterior portion
of the skull compare to the orbital region. GF1 (ch 14); CA2 (ch 6). Remarks:
this character is redefined here considering (Lapparent de Broin 2000)(secondary
roofing of the fossa temporalis) and (Gaffney et al. 2006) (temporal
emargination); to do so I added to the states defined in (Cadena et al. 2012) the
variations in height of the posterior portion of the skull and switch states 1 and 2
of (Gaffney et al. 2006)(ch 14).
15. Parietals, parietal-squamosal contact: 0 = present, upper temporal emargination
absent or poorly developed; 1 = absent, upper temporal emargination well
developed. GF1 (ch 15); JY1 (ch 11) & STF (ch 12) (Parietal A); HY2, KL,
BR (ch 7).
16. Parietals, parietal-pterygoid contact with the processus trochlearis pterygoidei: 0 =
absent, restricted to the processus inferior parietalis; 1 = present, ventral process
of the parietal reaches pterygoid on lateral side of sulcus palatinopterygoideus,
very close to the base of processus trochlearis pterygoidei. GF1 (ch 16). Remarks:
as pointed out by (Gaffney et al. 2006) this is a character very difficult to observe
in fossils, depending of preservation, but CT images can help on its observation.
17. Parietals, sulcus palatinopterygoides: 0 = absent; 1 = present and high; 2 = present
and low due to thick parietal and postorbital roof. GF1 (ch 17).
18. Parietals, enters orbital margin in dorsal view: 0 = no; 1 = yes. GF1 (ch 18).
19. Parietals, interparietal scute shape: 0 = absent; 1 = equilateral triangle; 2 =
elongated triangle with straight to convex anterior margin; 3 = slightly elongated
heart-like shape; 4 = parallel lateral sides, reaching the posterior margin of the
parietals; 5 = broad posteriorly, reaching the posterior margin of the parietals; 6 =
equilateral triangle elongated, with anterior margin posterior to the frontal-parietal
sutural contact. GF2 (ch 8). Remarks: many fossil turtles do not preserved the
sulci of scutes, see discussion about this character in (Lapparent de Broin et al.
2014) (suppl. Mat. 1 p. 16). In pleurodires, particularly in podocnemidids the sulci
indicating the shape of the interparietal scute are usually well preserved. I added
two extra states (state 3 and 6), which are particular shapes present in some
podocnemidids. Testudines with very complex skull scutes pattern as for example
Chelus fimbriata are code as not applicable (-) in the matrix.
20. Parietals, parietal scutes meeting medially: 0 = present; 1 = absent. New
character.
21. Jugals, jugal retracted from orbital margin: 0 = jugals enters orbital margin; 1 =
jugal slightly retracted; 2 = jugal widely retracted. GF1 (ch 20).
22. Jugals, jugal narrow dorsoventrally: 0 = absent, large exposure on the cheek; 1 =
present, exposure in the cheek is long horizontally and short vertically. GF1 (ch
21).
23. Jugals, jugal-quadrate contact: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1 (ch 22); HY2, KL &
BR (ch 9).
24. Jugals, exposure on triturating surface in ventral view of the skull: 0 = absent; 1 =
large. GF1 (ch 23).
25. Jugals, cheek emargination: 0 = almost absent, forming a straight line dominated
by the ventral edge of jugal; 1 = very advanced, exposing completely the fossa
temporalis; 2 = moderate, reaching almost the level of the most dorsal margin of
the orbit; 3 = slightly moderate, reaching the half level of the orbit, with an
advance ventral descending contribution of jugal and quadratojugal; 4 = very
shallow, complete ventral descending of jugal, resulting in a contact between this
bone and the quadrate; 5 = very shallow, formed by a posterior projection of the
maxilla, resulting in a contact between this bone and the maxilla, occasionally
separated by a very narrow fissure. Also the jugal has a contact with the quadrate,
but it is exclude it from the most ventral margin of the cheek emargination. CA2
(ch 18); GF2 (ch 11); GF1 (ch 39); JY1 (ch 15) & STF (ch 21) (Jugal B).
Remarks: character combined and redefined from (Cadena et al. 2012) and
(Gaffney et al. 2011) state characters have been reordered. Character 39 (maxilla-
quadrate contact) of (Gaffney et al. 2006) is clearly better defined as a state of the
cheek emargination character. The condition of a narrow fissure separating the
maxilla from the quadrate (State 2, GF1 (ch 39), considered by (Gaffney et al.
2006) as unique for Phosphatochelys and Ummulisani it is actually variable in
Phosphatochelys as the same authors show in (fig 199 E), a specimen lacking the
fissure and having a contact between the maxilla and quadrate. I include state 2 of
GF1 (ch 39) in the definition of state 5 here.
26. Jugals, jugal-parietal contact: 0 = absent; 1 = present. CA2 (ch 10); GF2 (ch 10).
27. Squamosals, posterior projection: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1 (ch 24); STF (ch
28, Squamosal D).
28. Squamosals, posteroventral vertical flange: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1 (ch 25).
29. Squamosals, lateral tubercle: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1 (ch 26), GF2 (ch 13).
30. Postorbitals, fossa orbitalis posterior enlargement: 0 = absent, orbital ring almost
same size as the medial margin of the fossa orbitalis 1 = present, much larger than
the orbital ring. GF1 (ch 27).
31. Postorbitals, septum orbitotemporale: 0 = absent; 1 = present, thick septum; 2 =
present, but laterally thin creating a partially open septum. GF1 (ch 28).
32. Postorbitals, length versus width: 0 = slightly longer that wide; 1 = three times or
more longer than wide; 2 = small, almost equal length vs. width. GF1 (ch 29).
Remarks: (Gaffney et al. 2006) defined this character in terms of size, however
the states were defined only respect to the length of the postorbital, then in
(Gaffney et al. 2011) the states were defined in terms of size of the postorbital
versus size of the orbit, here I precise better the states defining them
comparatively with the width too.
33. Premaxillae, protrude anteriorly beyond labial ridge: 0 = no, or slightly forming a
vertical to slightly incline wall; 1 = yes, projects anteriorly, specially visible in
ventral view. GF1 (ch 30).
34. Premaxillae, midline depression: 0 = absent, shallow, or indistinct; 1 = distinct
and wide, open U-like shaped; 2 = distinct but narrow, V-like shaped. GF1 (ch
31).
35. Premaxillae, dorsal sulcus: 0 = absent, smooth dorsal surface of the premaxilla; 1
= present, sulcus parallel to margin of the aperture narium externa. GF1 (ch 33).
36. Premaxillae, premaxilla-apertura narium interna contact: 0 = absent, usually
because of a presence of vomer or a medial contact between maxillae in ventral
view; 1 = present. GF2 (ch 14); JY1 (ch 25) & STF (ch 35) (Premaxilla D).
37. Maxillae, triturating surface: 0 = relatively narrow, parallel sides; 1 = triangular,
wider posteriorly than anteriorly; 2 = triangular, very wide posteriorly. GF1 (ch
34).
38. Maxillae, triturating surface pits: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1 (ch 35).
39. Maxillae, accessory ridge on triturating surface: 0 = absent; 1 = present, one
ridge; 2 = present, two ridges. GF1 (ch 36); GF2 (ch 20); STF (ch 41, Maxilla
E). Remarks: combined character from GF1 (ch 36) presence or absence of the
ridge and GF2 (ch 20) number of ridges presence.
40. Maxillae, maxilla-quadratojugal contact: 0 = absent, quadratojugal present; 1 =
present; 2 = absent, quadratojugal absent. GF1 (ch 38); JY1 (ch 17) & STF (ch
23) (Quadratojugal B).
41. Maxillae, orbitonarial bar width: 0 = roughly equal to or slightly less than
diameter of orbit; 1 = wider than the orbit; 2 = more than twice orbital diameter; 3
= very narrow, much less than diameter of orbit. GF1 (ch 40).
42. Maxillae, ventral rim of the orbit: 0 = very distinct margin; 1 = rim absent,
gradually continuous slope. GF1 (ch 42).
43. Maxillae-premaxillae, medial expansion of triturating surface: 0 = absent, wide
concavity at the midline; 1 = present, forming the medial maxillary ridge; 2 =
secondary palate with midline cleft. GF2 (ch 16).
44. Maxillae-palatines, secondary palate length: 0 = secondary palate absent; 1 =
relatively short (palate length/skull length less than 0.6), posterior edge of second
palate does not reach the basisphenoid level; 2 = long (palate length/skull length
more than 0.7), second palate reaches the basisphenoid level. GF2 (ch 17).
Remarks: I added an additional state for the complete absence of the secondary
palate, and also added to the definition of states 1 and 2 the ending level of the
secondary palate versus the basisphenoid.
45. Maxillae, labial ridge height and width: 0 = high and narrow; 1 = low and thick.
GF2 (ch 19).
46. Vomer, vomer bone: 0 = present, paired; 1 = present; 2 = absent. GF1 (ch 45);
JY1 (ch 26) & STF (ch 42) (Vomer).
47. Vomer, central bar: 0 = sutured at both ends; 1 = very thin, attached anteriorly
only or with a just touching posterior contact. GF1 (ch 47). Remarks: state 1 was
modified to include the occasional occurrence of the vomer in Podocnemis vogli,
which exhibits similar condition as in Azabbaremys moragjonesi.
48. Palatines, foramen palatinum posterius: 0 = in floor of the orbit; 1 = behind the
orbit, in floor of sulcus palatinopterygoideus. GF1 (ch 48).
49. Palatines, dorsally arched palate: 0 = absent, palate low to almost flat; 1 = present,
extremely arched. GF1 (ch 49).
50. Palatines, palatine contribution to upper triturating surface: 0 = absent or narrow
generally forming a very small triangle; 1 = moderate, large triangular shape; 2 =
large, palatine contributes with more than 50% of the width of the posterolateral
edge of the triturating surface and it is long anteriorly projected. GF1 (ch 50)
GF2 (ch 24).
51. Palatines, medial edges of palatal cleft: 0 = cleft absence; 1 = medial edges
curved; 2 = medial edges parallel. GF2 (ch 23). Remarks: I switched states 1 and
2, because what this character is showing is the medial advance of second palate.
52. Palatines, dorsal process of palatine contacts parietal in septum orbitotemporale: 0
= no, 1 = yes. GF2 (ch 25). Remarks: very well preserved skulls or broken at the
lateral temporal region are required to observe this character
53. Palatines, dorsal process of palatine contacts frontal in septum orbitotemporale: 0
= no; 1 = yes. GF2 (ch 26). Remarks: character visible in anterior view, looking
inside the orbits.
54. Palatines, palatine-basisphenoid contact: 0 = no; 1 = yes, completely separating
pterygoids. GF2 (ch 28).
55. Quadrates, antrum postoticum: 0 = absent, open incisura columellae auris; 1 =
present, small; 2 = absent, closed incisura columellae auris; 3 = present, moderate
to large. GF1 (ch 51); Quadrate E), STF (ch 53, Antrum postoticum A).
56. Quadrates, cavum tympani, arrangement between the quadrate, squamosal,
opisthotic, stapes and Eustachian tube: 0 = no posterior bone restrictions, cavum
tympani absent; 1 = cavum tympani well defined but open posteriorly, incisura
columella auris posteroventrally open without bone restrictions; 2 = cavum
tympani slightly open posteriorly, Eustachian tube and stapes separated by bone
or a very narrow fissure; 3 = cavum tympani with just a very narrow posterior
aperture, Eustachian tube and stapes enclosed by bone, incisura columella auris
circular to slightly oval in shape posteriorly directed (seen in lateral view); 4 =
cavum tympani completely closed with posterior acute tip, Eustachian tube and
stapes enclosed by bone, incisura columella auris oval elongated in shape and
ventrally directed (seen in lateral view). CA2 (ch 15); GF1 (ch 52 & ch 53); JY2
(ch 37) & STF (ch 53) (Quadrate F). Remarks: an additional state for
meiolaniforms, where the Eustachian tube and stapes are enclosed by bone, with
the contribution of the squamosal defined by (Sterli & de la Fuente 2013) is
excluded here for being uninformative for the scope of Pan-Pleurodiran evolution.
57. Quadrates, ventral process of the sulcus Eustachii: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1
(ch 54). Remarks: this character is visible in lateral and even better in
posterolateral view of the skull.
58. Quadrates, groove on incisura columella auris ridge: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1
(ch 55).
59. Quadrates, fossa precolumellaris: 0 = very small to absent; 1 = present, but very
shallow; 2 = present, deep and well defined. GF1 (ch 56).
60. Quadrates, medial process contacting braincase elements and underlying
cranioquadrate space: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1 (ch 58).
61. Quadrates, quadrate-basioccipital contact: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1 (ch 59).
62. Quadrates, condylus mandibularis position: 0 = near or in line with the
basioccipital-basisphenoid suture; 1 = distinctly anterior to plane of basioccipital-
basisphenoid suture; 2 = distinctly posterior to condylus occipitalis. GF1 (ch 60).
63. Quadrates, condylus mandibularis shape: 0 = much wider than long, with anterior
and posterior edges straight to concave making it shorter at midline; 1 = slightly
wider than long, in a “kidney bean” shape, with anterior edge straight to concave
and posterior edge convex. CA1 (ch 31).
64. Quadrates, ventral process: 0 =absent to very short; 1 = moderate, condylus
separate from the cavum tympani ventral margin level; 2 = long, condylus
mandibularis considerably separate from the cavum timpani region. CA1 (ch 18).
65. Pterygoids, cavum pterygoidei: 0 = absent; 1 = present, shallow to moderately
deep; 2 = very deep, delimited posteriorly by a well defined ridge of the medial
process of the quadrate. CA2 (ch 26); GF1 (ch 68 & ch 69); GF2 (ch 35); STF
(ch 69, Pterygoid K). Remarks: (Gaffney et al. 2006) considered two separate
characters for the concavity formed by the pterygoid, quadrate, basisphenoid and
prootic, which is associated with the pterygoideus muscle and some of the main
arteries entering the braincase, including the carotid. The two characters are: fossa
pterygoidea (ch 68) and cavum pterygoidei (ch 69) pointing out that these two
concavities are not homologous as was considered previously by (Lapparent de
Broin 2000) (podocnemidoid fossa) and that were independently acquired by
bothremydids (fossa pterygoidea) and podocnemidids plus Brasilemys, and
Hamadachelys (cavum pterygoidei). In (Gaffney et al. 2011) the difference
between the fossa pterygoidea and cavum pterygoidei is expressed with an
additional character (character 36), which deals with the anterior opening of this
concavity (absent for the fossa, and present with several states for the cavum).
Considering that the purpose of this study is to define a general character list for
all Pan-Pleurodirans, these are my considerations about the fossa pterygoidea
versus cavum pterygoidei. First of at all the definition of both characters is
literally ambiguous in (Gaffney et al. 2006) because the words cavum and fossa
mean in Latin exactly the same “hole” or “cavity”. Secondly, the bones involved,
position in the skull, as well as the function of the concavity are identical for both
bothremydids and podocnemidoids, making the split of the character not well
supported anatomically speaking, and finally variations in the roofing of the
cavity, and size of the anterior opening are related to the degree of evolution of
the character and can be expressed in a second character as I define it here.
66. Pterygoids, cavum pterygoidei flooring and anterior opening: 0 = uncovered by
the pterygoid or basisphenoid, anteriorly closed by the pterygoid bone; 1 =
slightly covered anteromedially by the basisphenoid and pterygoid, anterior
opening small; 2 = partially to fully covered by the pterygoid flange, anterior
opening moderate: 3 = partially to fully covered by the pterygoid flange, anterior
opening large, foramen cavernosum opens in roof of cavum pterygoidei. GF2 (ch
35 and ch 36). Remarks: this character is a combination of character 35 and 36
from (Gaffney et al. 2011).
67. Pterygoids, pterygoid flange: 0 = absent; 1 = partially developed; 2 = well
developed, covering the cavum pterygoidei and projected ventrally. CA1 (ch 28);
GF2 (ch 37).
68. Pterygoids, processus trochlearis pterygoidei: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1 (ch
70); GF2 (ch 38); JY1 (ch 42) & STF (ch 63) (Pterygoid E).
69. Pterygoids, processus trochlearis pterygoidei lateral margin: 0 = very inclined
compared with the horizontal axis of the processus; 1 = low inclination compared
with the horizontal axis of the processus. GF2 (ch 38). Remarks: (Gaffney et al.
2011) combined this character in a single one together with the presence/absence
of processus trochlearis pterygoidei. Splitting the character in two, as I do here,
keeps separate and without several states one of the principal synapomorphies of
Pan-Pleurodirans.
70. Pterygoids, trigeminal ridge: 0 = absent; 1 = thin, creating a shallow canal along
the lateral margin of the pterygoid and medial of the quadrate. GF1 (ch 72).
Remarks: a ridge a long the quadrate process of the pterygoid is present in many
turtles, but the trigeminal ridge defined by (Gaffney et al. 2006) present in the
subgroup Taphrosphyina (Bothremydidae) is very thin and I added to the
definition that it is accompanied by a shallow canal along the quadrate and
basisphenoid, reason because it is very thin.
71. Pterygoids, foramen posterius canalis carotici interni (fpcci): 0 = absent; 1 =
present. New character. Remarks: I split character 74 from (Gaffney et al. 2006)
in two here, presence/absence and position of the foramen (character 72, this
study).
72. Pterygoids, position of the foramen posterius canalis carotici interni (fpcci): 0 = in
basisphenoid or basisphenoid-pterygoid suture; 1 = in prootic or close to prootic-
basisphenoid suture; 2 = in quadrate or quadrate-pterygoid suture; 3 = in
pterygoid-basisphenoid-quadrate suture. GF1 (ch 74); GF2 (ch 49); JY1 (ch 56,
Canalis Caroticum A); STF (ch 100, Canalis Caroticum G). Remarks: the
terminology of the carotid foramina has been recently redefined by (Rabi et al.
2013) pointing out that the fpcci is absent in basal turtles and paracryptodires, and
the foramen present at the basisphenoid of these turtles it is actually the foramen
posterius canalis carotici cerebralis, this makes that the original states defined for
this character in (Gaffney et al. 2006) need to be update as I described above.
73. Pterygoids, posterior margin of pterygoid forms part of foramen posterius canalis
carotici interni: 0 = no, pterygoid does not enter/touch the foramen; 1 = yes,
pterygoid do enter/touch the anterior margin of foramen. GF1 (ch 75).
74. Pterygoids, foramen posterius canalis carotici palatinum (fpccp) (previously
known as foramen caroticum laterale): 0 = present; 1 = absent. GF1 (ch 76).
Remarks: see (Rabi et al. 2013) for the definition of the foramina related to
carotid arteries. For crown-Testudines this character can only be visible on the
dorsal surface of the pterygoid, limiting the number of fossil specimens that can
be scored.
75. Pterygoids, midline contact: 0 = midline contact of pterygoids relatively long; 1 =
midline contact very short. GF1 (ch 77); JY1 (ch 44) & STF (ch 65) (Pterygoid
G).
76. Pterygoids, processus pterygoideus externus: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1 (ch
72); JY1 (ch 67) (Pterygoid I).
77. Epipterygoid, epipterygoid bone between the parietal and pterygoid: 0 = present;
1 = absent. GF1 (ch 78); JY2 (ch 37) & STF (ch 57) (Epipterygoid A).
78. Supraoccipital, supraoccipital-quadrate contact: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1 (ch
79).
79. Supraoccipital, crista supraoccipitalis: 0 = very short to absent; 1 = moderate to
very long. GF1 (ch 80), GF2 (ch 40); JY1 (ch 46) & STF (ch 72)
(Supraoccipital A); HY2, KL, & BR (ch 28). Remarks: I consider the crista
supraoccipitalis in three separate characters combined and redefined from
previous studies. The first one deals with the presence or absence of the crista
(Character 78). The second deals with the presence or absence of the horizontal
plate (Character 79), a synapomorphic character for Podocnemidae sensu (Cadena
et al. 2012) following also (Gaffney et al. 2011) who also pointed out that the
horizontal plate of the crista supraoccipitalis is lost in Erymnochelys and
Peltocephalus, however after the direct examination of important number of
specimens for these two species (see supplemental information 5), I conclude that
the absence of the horizontal plate is actually atypical condition for both species.
The last character of the crista supraoccipitalis is related with the shape of the
lateral expansion of the horizontal plate (Character 80).
80. Supraoccipital, crista supraoccipitalis horizontal plate along its ventral edge and
posterior ending level: 0 = horizontal plate absent, crista ending before the most
posterior tip of squamosals; 1 = horizontal plate present, crista goes beyond the
most posterior end of squamosals; 2 = horizontal plate present, crista goes beyond
the most posterior end of squamosals but dorsally covered by the posterolateral
expansion of parietals (very shallow temporal emargination). GF1 (ch 40).
Remarks: see remarks Character 78. The third state considers the condition in taxa
with very shallow to almost absent temporal emargination, as for example
Dacquemis paleomorpha see (Gaffney et al. 2002) (fig 2).
81. Supraoccipital, crista supraoccipitalis lateral expansion of the horizontal plate: 0 =
uniform width from the anterior to the posterior aspect, ending in an acute to
rounded tip in dorsal view; 1 = short, wider posteroventrally than anteroventrally,
ending in a bulbous-like shape in dorsal view. CA1 (ch 12); STF (ch 74,
Supraoccipital C). Remarks: see remarks Character 79.
82. Supraoccipital, dorsal exposure on skull roof: 0 = absent; 1 = present, small; 2 =
present, large. GF2 (ch 39); JY2 (ch 49) & STF (ch 73) (Supraoccipital B).
83. Exoccipitals, foramen jugulare posterius: 0 = not formed in bone; 1 = formed by
bone and open or partially closed; 2 = completely closed by bone. GF1 (ch 82).
84. Exoccipitals, condylus occipitalis: 0 = formed by the basioccipital plus both
exoccipitals; 1 = exoccipitals only, medial contact between the exoccipitals in
ventral view. GF1 (ch 84).
85. Exoccipitals, exoccipital-quadrate contact: 0 = absent; 1 = extensive, prootic
absent; 2 = narrow, prootic present; 3 = narrow, prootic absent. GF1 (ch 85).
86. Exoccipitals, ventral process: 0 = absent to very short allowing a contact between
the basioccipital and quadrate in ventral view of the skull; 1 = present, exoccipital
reaches the basisphenoid, avoiding a basioccipital-quadrate contact in ventral
view of the skull. GF1 (ch 86). Remarks: (Gaffney et al. 2011) pointed out that
the ventral process of the exoccipitals is a unique condition for euraxemydids,
however some bothremydids have also a ventral process of the exoccipital; for
example Labrostochelys. The difference or better the exclusive condition of
euraxemydids is that the ventral process is anteriorly extended avoiding a
basioccipital-quadrate contact, condition that was added to the states here.
87. Exoccipitals, foramina nervi hypoglossi: 0 = separated on occipital surface; 1 =
combined and recessed below occipital surface, almost same size of foramen
jugulare posterius. GF2 (ch 43).
88. Basioccipital, basioccipital size ratio (length/width maximum values): 0 = =0.60;
1 = =0.59. GF1 (ch 87), GF2 (ch 44).
89. Basioccipital, basioccipital-opisthotic contact: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1 (ch
89).
90. Basioccipital, tubera position: 0 = absent or vey incipient located closer to medial
axis of basioccipital; 1 = laterally positioned. GF2 (ch 45). Remarks: character
reworded.
91. Basioccipital, horizontal occipital shelf: 0 = absent to very narrow; 1 = present,
wide. GF2 (ch 46). Remarks: character reworded.
92. Prootics, hyomandibular branch of facial nerve lies in its own canal: 0 = no; 1 =
yes. GF1 (ch 90). Remarks: according to (Gaffney et al. 2006) this is a
synapomorphy of Pan-Pleurodira, and a character that can only be observe in
fragmentary prootics, well preserved skull with open otic chamber, or CT images.
93. Prootics, foramen stapedio-temporale (fst) orientation: 0 = more dorsally oriented
on roof of otic chamber; 1 = more anteroventrally oriented, located at the anterior
surface of the otic chamber. GF1 (ch 92); STF (ch 91, Stapedial Artery C).
94. Prootics, foramen stapedio-temporale and foramen nervi trigemini: 0 = separated
by most of prootic; 1 = separated by narrow bar of prootic. GF1 (ch 93).
95. Prootics, ventral exposure: 0 = most of the prootic exposed ventrally; 1 = prootic
about half covered by quadrate and basisphenoid; 2 = nearly all of the prootic
completely covered by the quadrate, basisphenoid, and pterygoid. GF1 (ch 94).
96. Prootics, processus trochlearis oticum: 0 = absent: 1 = present. GF1 (ch 96).
97. Opisthotics, processus interfenestralis exposure: 0 = exposed ventrally; 1 =
covered by bone. GF1 (ch 99); ST (ch 56); STF (ch 82, Opisthotic D).
98. Opisthotics, fenestra postotica closed medially: 0 = absent; 1 = present, closed
medially by opisthotic-quadrate contact. GF1 (ch 100).
99. Opisthotics, fenestra postotica short horizontal slit: 0 = absent, more open
dorsoventrally; 1 = present, short horizontal slit. GF1 (ch 101).
100. Opisthotics: processus paroccipitalis: 0 = projects posteriorly beyond squamosal;
1 = smaller, does not project beyond squamosal. GF1 (ch 102).
101. Opisthotics, thin horizontal flange on posterior margin: 0 = absent; 1 = present,
just dorsal to fenestra postotica. GF1 (ch 103).
102. Basisphenoid, basisphenoid-quadrate contact: 0 = absent, separated by prootic or
pterygoid; 1 = present, narrow occurring at the widest region of the basisphenoid;
2 = present, wide. GF1 (ch 104), STF (ch 56, Quadrate I). Remarks: after direct
examination of several specimens of Pelomedusidae (see Supplementary material
1), I conclude that the most common condition is a narrow contact between these
bones, taking this into account I change the order of the states 1 and 2 in contrast
to (Gaffney et al. 2006) making the acquisition of a contact between
basisphenoid-quadrate gradational (absent, narrow, wide).
103. Basisphenoid, ventral outline: 0 = elongated, blade-like shape, not sutured to
pterygoids; 1 = triangular in shape; 2 = pentagonal in shape; 3 = elongated, blade-
like shape but strongly sutured to pterygoids; 4 = V-shaped pointing anteriorly.
GF1 (ch 106).
104. Basisphenoid, processus clinoideus: 0 = present with abducent canal; 1 = absent,
canal is a groove. GF1 (ch 107).
105. Basisphenoid, sella turcica/dorsum sella: 0 = deep, well-defined margins: 1 = very
shallow, low margins. GF1 (ch 110).
Lower jaw
106. Splenial, splenial bone: 0 = present: 1 = absent. GF1 (ch 113); JY1 (ch 59,
Splenial A); HY2 (ch 45); KL & BR (ch 44).
107. Dentaries, lingual ridge in lateral view: 0 = same height or lower than the labial
ridge; 1 = higher than the labial ridge. GF1 (ch 114); HY2 (ch 43); PH (ch 7);
KL & BR (ch 42). Remarks: reworded from (Gaffney et al. 2006) to include the
condition in outgroups of having a lingual ridge of same height of lower than
labial.
108. Dentaries, dentary pits: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1 (ch 115).
109. Dentaries, U-shaped lingual ridge on symphysis: 0 = absent, lingual ridge ends in
V-shaped on symphysis; 1 = present, narrow U-shaped; 2 = present, wide U-
shaped. GF1 (ch 116). Remarks: extra state added for wide U-shaped taxa.
110. Dentaries, medial contact of dentaries (symphysis): 0 = fused; 1 = sutured. GF1
(ch 117); JY1 (ch 58) & STF (ch 120) (Dentary A).
111. Dentaries, triturating surface width: 0 = narrow, almost same width at symphysis
and posteriorly; 1 = much wider posteriorly than on symphysis; 2 = very wide,
anterior and posteriorly. GF1 (ch 118); HY2, KL, & BR (ch 39). Remarks: a
third state was added for very wide triturating surfaces.
112. Dentaries, widely exposed on lateral surface: 0 = yes, wide posterior exposure; 1
= no, covered posteriorly by surangular. GF1 (ch 119).
113. Dentaries, accessory ridge: 0 = absent; 1 = present, parallel to lingual and labial
ridges; 2 = present, located along the symphysis. CA1 (ch 39). Remarks: a third
state was added for differentiate the position of the ridge.
114. Dentaries, medial margin shape and angle between rami: 0 = V-shaped, =90º
angle between rami; 1 = U-shaped, obtuse, >90º angle between rami; 2 = U-
shaped with a medial tip due to the posteromedial participation of the coronoid in
the triturating surface, >90º angle between rami. CA1 (ch 34). Remarks: character
modified from (Cadena 2010) including not only the angle between rami, but also
the shape that these form at symphysis, expressed by the medial margin of
dentaries.
115. Surangulars, foramen nervi auriculotemporalis: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1 (ch
120).
116. Coronoids, wide lateral exposure: 0 = no; 1 = yes. GF1 (ch 121).
117. Prearticulars, prearticular-angular contact and the anteroventral opening of the
fossa Meckelii: 0 = very long contact closing most of the anteroventral opening of
the fossa Meckelii; 1 = short contact, long anteroventral exposure of the fossa
Meckelii. GF1 (ch 122). Remarks: I reworded this character in terms not only of
the opening of the fossa Meckelii, but also of the prearticular-angular contact.
118. Articulars, processus retroarticularis: 0 = long and posteriorly projected; 1 = very
short to absent; 2 = short, projected posterolaterally; 3 = short to moderately long,
projected posteroventrally. CA1 (ch 36); GF1 (ch 123). Remarks: character
combined and reworded from (Cadena 2010) and (Gaffney et al. 2006).
119. Articulars, foramen chorda tympani enclosed in processus retroarticularis: 0 = no;
1 = yes. GF2 (ch 56).
Cervical vertebrae
120. Cervical vertebrae, cervical ribs: 0 = present: 1 = absent. GF1 (ch 124); JY1 (ch
101) & STF (ch 182) (Cervical Rib A).
121. Cervical vertebrae, cervical postzygapophyses: 0 = all separate; 1 = some fused.
GF1 (ch 125); STF (ch 198) (Cervical Vertebra J).
122. Cervical vertebrae, posterodorsal extension of postzygapophyses on neural spine:
0 = present; 1 = absent. GF1 (ch 126). Remarks: character reworded.
123. Cervical vertebrae, cervical centra formation: 0 = amphicoelous, platycoelous; 1 =
formed central articulation. GF1 (ch127); JY1 (ch 105) & STF (ch 187)
(Cervical Articulation A); HY2 (ch 49); and Kl & BR (ch 48). Remarks: the
original definition by (Gaffney et al. 2006) deals with two features in the same
character, one is the formation of a cervical centra articulation and the second
with the shape of this. I split the character in two, the formation of the cervical
centra (character 123) and the second the shape of this (character 124), which is
Character 58 of (Gaffney et al. 2011).
124. Cervical vertebrae, cervicals (4-6) cervical centra shape: 0 = oval to circular in
shape; 1 = heterocoelic or “saddle-shaped”; 2 = wider than high, with two
ventrolateral keels. GF2 (ch 58). Remarks: considering that there is considerable
variation in the shape of the centra from anterior to posterior cervical vertebrae in
some taxa (see (Lapparent de Broin 2000) and (Cadena 2010)), I restrict this
character to cervicals 4-6.
125. Cervical vertebrae, cervical 2 biconvex: 0 = no; 1 = yes. GF1 (ch 128); GF2 (ch
59).
126. Cervical vertebrae, posterior cervicals with strongly developed ventral keels: 0 =
absent or slightly developed in all vertebrae; 1 = present, more developed on
posterior vertebrae. CA2 (ch 37); JY1 (ch 103) & STF (ch 184) (Cervical
Vertebra B); HY2 (ch 48); and KL & Br (ch 47).
Caudal vertebrae
127. Caudal vertebrae, caudal articulation pattern: 0 = platycoelous, amphicoelous; 1 =
formed centra varies, opisthocoelous and procoelous; 2 = all centra procoelous.
GF1 (ch 129); JY1 (ch 119) & STF (ch 205) (Caudal B); HY2, KL & BR (ch
58 and 59).
Pelvic-Shoulder girdles
128. Pelvic girdles, tenth thoracic centrum: 0 = not incorporated into sacrum; 1 =
incorporated into sacrum. GF1 (ch 132).
129. Pelvic girdles, pelvis-shell attachment: 0 = pelvis-shell attachment by ligaments; 1
= pelvis attached by strong sutural contact of the ischium and pubis with the
plastron, and ilium with the carapace. GF1 (ch 133); ST (ch 138); JY1 (ch 134)
& STF (ch 221) (Pelvis A).
130. Pelvic girdles, dorsal part of ilium: 0 = inclined with anterior and posterior
processes; 1 = columnar expanded mediolaterally. GF1 (ch 134).
131. Pelvic girdles, acetabulum versus distal ilium portion distance in lateral view: 0 =
distal ilium and acetabulum relatively far from midline, creating a very wide
pelvis; 1 = ilium and acetabulum close to midline. GF1 (ch 135). Remarks:
character reworded.
132. Shoulder girdles, coracoid dorsolongitudinal ridge: 0 = absent; 1 = present. CA1
(ch 44).
133. Humeri, shoulder on lateral side of head: 0 = present; 1 = absent. GF1 (ch 137).
Carapace
134. Carapace, geometry of the outline in terms of maximum width and length: 0 =
maximum length equals or slightly longer than the maximum width which located
right at the half of the carapace 1 = maximum length longer than the maximum
width which is located anterior to the half of the carapace; 2 = maximum length
much longer than the maximum width which is located at the very posterior level
of the carapace; 3 = maximum length longer than the maximum width which is
located posteriorly close to the carapace half. PE (ch 1). Remarks: the geometry
of the outline of the carapace can be very variable character, however the most
important geometric patterns can be group in terms of the maximum length and
width and the location of the maximum width in contrast to the half of the
carapace as defined here, observing the carapace in dorsal view.
135. Nuchal, nuchal bone geometry: 0 = two or more times wider than length; 1 =
width greater than length but less than two times; 2 = width approximately equals
length; 3 = width approximately equals length, maximum width at least twice the
anterior edge width; 4 = width less than length; 5 = nuchal bone greatly
emarginated, anterior edge width equals maximum width. GF1 (ch 139); PE (ch
3 and 4); STF (ch 128) (Nuchal C). Remarks: as pointed out by (Gaffney et al.
2006) this is a very variable character within species. Here I define the character
in terms of geometry of the nuchal, placing it inside squares or rectangles in order
to visualize easier the different potential patterns. It is also important to notice that
although the character is defined for observation in dorsal view of the carapace,
the ideal observation will be in anterodorsal view, considering that most turtles
have a relatively dome shell. Having this into account potential differences could
occur in the geometry of the nuchal if dorsal versus anterodorsal views are
compared. However, considering that almost all illustrated specimens in literature
have a dorsal view and lacks the anterodorsal, I suggest using only the dorsal
view for this character.
136. Nuchal, nuchal embayment: 0 = absent, 1 = present. GF1 (ch 154).
137. Neurals, neural series completeness: 0 = neural series reaches suprapygal; 1 =
reaches costals 8; 2 = reaches costals 7; 3 = reaches costals 6; 4 = neurals absent
or discontinuous. GF1 (ch 141); JY1 (ch 68) & STF (ch 134) (Costal B).
138. Neurals, neural series pattern: 0 = irregular, width relatively even; 1 = irregular,
neurals 2 and 4 four-sided, alternating in width; 2 = regular mostly hexagonal,
coffin-shaped. GF1 (ch 145). Remarks: I switched states 0 and 1, considering
Kayentachelys aprix condition as known primitive condition.
139. Neurals, neurals number: 0 = more than eight; 1 = eight; 2 = seven; 3 = 6 or less,
but at least one neural dorsally exposed. GF1 (ch 146); HY2, KL & BR (ch 85 &
ch 87) and PH (ch 33). Remarks: character reworded.
140. Neurals, arrangement between neurals 1, 2, 3 and costals 1, 2, 3 and 4: 0 = neural
1 contacts costals 1 and 2, neural 2 (four-sided) only contacts costal 2; 1 = neural
1 contacts costal 1 and 2, or tip contact with costal 2, neural 2 (four-sided) only
contacts costal 2, neural 3 contacts costal 2, 3, and 4; 2 = neural 1 (four-sided)
contacts costal 1 and 2, neural 2 contacts costal 2 and 3, neural 3 (four-sided) only
contacts costal 3. 3 = neural 1 (four-sided) only contacts costal 1, neural 3
contacts costal 2. CA2 (ch 43); GF1 (ch 144); JY1 (ch 64) & STF (ch 129)
(Neural A). Remarks: I combined the four-sided neural character of Gaffney et al.
(2006) with the arrangement of the three most anterior neurals and costals defined
by (Cadena et al. 2012).
141. Neurals, neural and costal bones with keels or knobs: 0 = present; 1 = only
neurals 1-5; 2 = absent, smooth surface. GF2 (ch 65); JY1 (ch 61) & STF (ch
122) (Carapace B) and HY2, KL, & BR (ch 84). Remarks: I modified the
character adding a third state of keels not only on neurals but also on costals.
142. Costals, iliac scar position: 0 = absent or very incipient scar on costals 7 and 8; 1
= on costals 7, 8, pygal, and peripheral 1; 2 = on costal 8 and suprapygal; 3 = on
costals 7, 8, and suprapygal; 4 = restricted to costals 7 and 8. GF1 (ch 142).
Remarks: I added to states, one representing the condition of Platychelys
oberndorferi important to understand the evolution of the pelvic girdle in Pan-
Pleurodira and state 2 for those taxa with iliac scar restricted to costal 8 and
suprapygal.
143. Costals, costal 1 maximum length versus costal 2 maximum length: 0 = costal 1
shorter than the length of costal 2; 1 = costal 1 equals or slightly longer than twice
the length of costal 2; 2 = costal 1 more than twice longer than the length of costal
2. GF1 (ch 143). Remarks: states were modified and split in three to cover all
possible relationships with the length of costals 1 and 2.
144. Costals, arrangement between costal 1 and axillary process (buttress): 0 =
axillary process of hyoplastron restricted to peripherals; 1 = short axillary process
entering into costal 1; 2 = long axillary process reaching costal 2 or at the contact
between costal 1 and 2; 3 = long axillary process reaching almost the central point
of costal 1, accompanied by a very strong and well defined costal rib. GF1 (ch
148). Remarks: I added to the definition of this character the length and position
of the axillary process onto costal 1. The shape of the axillary process or its scar is
even more variable than its entrance position from peripherals and length, so I
avoid the use of the shape, however, some of them can be apomorphic or generic
useful characters (see (Lapparent de Broin & Wermer 1998); (Cadena et al.
2012b) (character 176).
145. Costals, inguinal process (buttress): 0 = absent or very short touching most
posterolateral portion of costal 5; 1 = inguinal process of hypoplastron long on
costal 5; 2 = inguinal process long and restricted to costal 4. GF1 (ch 150).
Remarks: character reworded and I added a third state considering the condition
in Chelus spp. see (Cadena et al. 2008).
146. Peripherals, axillary process extent on ventral surface of peripherals: 0 = reaches
peripheral 2; 1 = reaches anteromedial or medial margin of peripheral 3; 2 =
reaches posteromedial margin of peripheral 3; 3 = restricted to peripheral 4. GF1
(ch 149). Remarks: I split state 2 of (Gaffney et al. 2006) in states 2 and 3 here.
There are taxa with hyoplastron only reaching the peripheral 4 and this should be
considered as a different state and not just a variant of posteromedial peripheral 3
contact.
147. Peripherals, length of contact between peripheral 1 and costal 1 in dorsal view: 0
= anterior margin of peripheral 1 less than twice the length of the contact between
peripheral 1 and costal 1; 1 = anterior margin of peripheral 1 is twice or more the
length of peripheral 1 and costal 1 contact; 2 = contact between peripheral 1 and
costal 1 absent due to a large nuchal. GF1 (ch147). Remarks: I switched the
states order, considering that the most primitive condition for this character can be
obtained from Kayentachelys aprix and Notoemys spp. (Gaffney et al. 2006)
defined a fourth state (no contact due to small nuchal) to include the condition in
Araripemys barretoi, however this is incorrect, because there is a contact between
the small triangular in shape peripheral 1 and costal 1, so state 3 was removed for
this character.
148. Peripherals, peripheral 1 anterior margin width versus lateral margin length: 0 =
lateral margin longer than the anterior margin; 1 = anterior margin width longer
than lateral margin; 2 = anterior equals to lateral margin length. PE (ch 2).
Remarks: (Pérez-García & Lapparent de Broin 2013) did not provide details of
where the length/width should be measurement in the peripheral 1, here I
redefined the character in terms of the anterior margin width and lateral margin
length in dorsal view of the carapace.
149. Suprapygal, shape of suprapygal in contact with the pygal: 0 = pentagonal to
trapezoidal in shape; 1 = almost triangular tapering anteriorly. New character.
150. Cervical, cervical scute(s): 0 = present; 1 = absent. GF1 (ch 138); JY1 (ch 70) &
STF (ch 138) (Cervical A).
151. Marginals, marginal scute 1 anterior margin width versus lateral margin length: 0
= lateral margin longer or equal than the anterior margin; 1 = anterior margin
width longer than lateral margin. PE (ch 6). Remarks: in contrast to the states in
character 149 where I separate equals from longer or wider conditions, in the case
of marginals 1, they never are much longer than wide, so I combine the case
where they are slightly longer than wide with equal width-length condition.
152. Marginals, marginal scute 1 proportion overlapping the anterior margin/portion of
peripheral bone 1: 0 = between 30 to 60%; 1 = less than 30%; 2 = more than 60%.
PE (ch 8). Remarks: character redefined in terms of the proportion of peripheral 1
covered by marginal 1 at the anterior margin, also adding a third state where the
marginal 1 overlaps more that 60% of peripheral 1.
153. Supramarginal scutes: 0 = present; 1 = absent. GF1 (ch 151).
154. Vertebrals, vertebral scutes 2-4 width versus pleurals 2 and 3 width: 0 = vertebral
2-4 wider than pleurals 2 and 3; 1 = vertebrals 2-4 slightly squared, equal to or
narrower than pleurals 2 and 3. CA3 (ch 178); GF1 (ch 152); JY1 (ch 73) &
STF (ch 141) (Vertebral B). Remarks: I restrict this character to vertebrals 2-4
and pleurals 2 and 3, other anterior or posterior vertebrals and pleurals have wide
variability, most of the cases variations that constitute apomorphies for some taxa.
155. Vertebrals, vertebral scute 1 reaches anterior margin of carapace: 0 = no, medial
contact between marginals 1 or cervicals present; 1 = yes. GF1 (ch 153).
156. Vertebrals, vertebral scute 1 shape of the anterolateral margins: 0 = lateral
margins parallel to midline axis of carapace and anterior margin straight at the
medial level; 1 = lateral margins anteriorly divergent, anterior margin medially
convergent in acute tip or convex; 2 = lyre-shaped vertebral 1, lateral margins
divergent at the most anterior corner, anterior margin with a medial notch. PE (ch
9). Remarks: I redefined this character in terms of the lateral and anterior margins
of vertebral 1.
157. Vertebrals, vertebral scute 1 overlap onto anterior peripherals and nuchal: 0 =
overlapping nuchal and peripherals 1; 1 = overlapping nuchal, peripherals 1 and
2; 2 = overlapping only nuchal. CA3 (ch 177).
158. Vertebrals, lateral position of the sulcus between vertebral scutes 3 and 4 in taxa
with five vertebrals: 0 = sulcus positioned on costal 6; 1 = sulcus positioned on
costal 5. JY1 (ch 74) & STF (142) (Vertebral C). Remarks: I modified the
definition of the character, instead of using the position of the sulcus on neurals, I
use the position on costals 5 or 6, doing this taxa with completely absent of
neurals can be scored for the character too.
159. Vertebrals, most posterior vertebral scute overlapping peripheral 10: 0 = no,
overlapping only peripheral 11 and pygal, or restricted to suprapygal; 1 = yes,
overlapping pygal, peripheral 10 and 11. New character. Remarks: this character
resembles character 9 (width of vertebral 5) of (Pérez-García & Lapparent de
Broin 2013) because when the vertebral 5 or 6 is the widest generally reaches
peripheral 10, I consider that with the new definition the character can be more
useful in cases where not all vertebrals are preserved or is difficult to establish
clear difference in the width of them.
160. Thoracic rib, thoracic rib 1 versus 2: 0 = thoracic rib 1 large and separated from
thoracic rib 2; 1 = thoracic rib 1 reduced, almost same size of the medial portion
of thoracic rib 2, both separated by an oval elongated space; 2 = thoracic rib 1
shorter than the medial exposed portion of thoracic rib 2, very small oval space
between them. GF1 (ch155). Remarks: (Gaffney et al. 2006) separated this
character in two states, however after examination of important number of extant
pleurodires (see Supplementary material 1), I conclude that state 1 of (Gaffney et
al. 2006) can be split in two distinct conditions, related not only to the size of
thoracic rib 1 versus thoracic rib 2, but also in terms of the separation between
them.
161. Thoracic rib, articulation facet on thoracic rib 1: 0 = absent; 1 = present, facet or
tubercle on anterior margin of thoracic rib 1. GF1 (ch 157).
162. Thoracic vertebrae, shape of thoracic vertebrae: 0 = cylindrical, longer than wide,
keeled ventrally; 1 = smooth and flat ventrally, hexagonal in shape with central
lateral notch. New character.
163. Costovertebral tunnel, costovertebral tunnel formed by thoracic ribs and
vertebrae: 0 = present, anteriorly and posteriorly only; 1 = present, wide for the
entire length; 1 = absent. GF1 (ch 156).
Plastron
164. Mesoplastra, medial contact between mesoplastra: 0 = present; 1 = absent,
mesoplastron laterally restricted, wider than long and reduced in size; 2 = absent,
mesoplastron laterally restricted, roughly equidimensional; 3 = mesoplastron
absent. GF1 (ch 158); JY1 (ch 85) & STF (ch 160) (Mesoplastron A) and AN
(ch 122). Remarks: character reworded.
165. Entoplastron, shape and participation of the entoplastron in the anterior plastral
lobe margin: 0 = pentagonal in shape, anterior margin of entoplastron included in
the anterior margin of plastron (anterior entoplastron process); 1 = four-sided
diamond or rhombus-shaped, with not contribution to the anterior margin of the
plastron, due to medial contact of epiplastra; 2 = triangular in shape, with not
contribution to the anterior margin of the plastron, due to medial contact of
epiplastra; 3 = entoplastron absent. CA4 (ch 75); GF1 (ch159 and ch 160); JY1
(ch 78) & STF (ch 149 and 153) (Entoplastron A and E). Remarks: the shape
of the entoplastron is in part conditioned by the presence or not of a medial
contact between epiplastra, I suggest to consider these two characters in a single
one as defined here.
166. Entoplastron, posterior end of the entoplastron reaching the axillary notch level of
plastron: 0 = absent, entoplastron located very anterior to the axillary notch level;
1 = present. CA4 (ch 179). Remarks: character restricted to turtles lacking long
posterior entoplastron process (most basal Testudines).
167. Epiplastra, anteriorly projected tuberosities of the epiplastron: 0 = present, two or
more; 1 = absent. CA4 (ch 77); GF1 (ch 163). Remarks: (Gaffney et al. 2006)
defined this character as gular scute projections, however the tuberosities
(projections) are part of the anterior portion of the epiplastron and not of the
scutes. This character is better defined as part of the epiplastra, as I suggest here.
168. Epiplastra, anterior plastral lobe margin shape: 0 = dentate straight to slightly
convex (trapezoidal); 1 = smooth, highly convex; 2 = smooth, acute tip. CA4 (ch
77); GF1 (ch 164); PE (ch 11). Remarks: character 77 of (Cadena et al. 2013) is
split in character 167 and character 168 (this study), also character 164 of
(Gaffney et al. 2006) is split in character 167 and character 168 (this study), the
logic behind this changes is that the anterior plastral lobe have three well defined
features: presence or absence of tuberosities (character 166, this study); its shape
more clearly defined by its anterior margin (character 167, this study); and the
proportion between its length and its width (character 168, this study).
169. Epiplastra, anterior plastral lobe width/length ratio: 0 = maximum width at the
hyoplastron notch (base of the anterior plastral lobe) almost twice the maximum
length; 1 = maximum width slightly longer than the maximum length; 2 =
maximum width almost three times the maximum length. GF1 (ch 164).
Remarks: character redefined.
170. Epiplastra, anterior plastral lobe reaches carapace anterior margin: 0 = yes, same
level of beyond the anterior margin of carapace; 1 = no, well posterior to the
anterior margin of carapace. GF1 (ch 173).
171. Hyoplastra, central fontanelle at the hyo-hypoplastron suture: 0 = absent; 1 =
present. CA4 (ch 79). Remarks: character can have ontogenetic variability
(fontanelle present in hatching/juveniles for some taxa). So avoid using it if there
is evidence of specimens in early ontogenetic stages having a central fontanelle.
172. Hyoplastra, plastral bridge length at the axillary and inguinal notches: 0 = long; 1
= very short. CA1 (ch 50).
173. Hyoplastra, axillary musk duct location: 0 = musk duct are absent; 1 = located at
the most anterior tip of the sutural contact between hyoplastron and peripherals
(in buttress), before axillary notch; 2 = present in bridge. GF2 (ch 69). Remarks:
character reworded and extra state added for cases where the duct(s) are absent.
174. Hyoplastra, number of musk ducts in bridge: 0 = one pair; 1 = three pairs; 2 =
four or more pairs, with or without an extra par in buttress. GF2 (ch 70).
Remarks: character reworded.
175. Xiphiplastra, anal notch: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1 (ch 174); JY1 (ch 87) &
STF (163) (Xiphiplastron A).
176. Xiphiplastra, size and shape of ischial scar: 0 = large linear or V-shaped; 1 =
small, oval to circular. GF1 (ch 168). Remarks: I removed state 0 of (Gaffney et
al. 2006) for this character considering that is redundant with character 129 (this
study).
177. Xiphiplastra, ischial scar position related to the anal notch of xiphiplastron: 0 =
the most posterior tip of the scar reaches the level of the anal notch; 1 = the most
posterior tip is located anteriorly, before the anal notch level. CA3 (ch 180).
178. Gular, gular scutes: 0 = two (one pair); 1 = one gular scute. GF1 (ch 162); JY1
(ch 91) & STF (ch 167) (Gular A). Remarks: intergular for (Gaffney et al. 2006)
and other authors.
179. Humerals, medial contact between humeral scutes: 0 = present; 1 = absent, even
just a touching tips. CA2 (ch 46); GF1 (ch 170); PE (ch 14). Remarks: the
arrangement between gular, extragulars (gulars for (Gaffney et al. 2006)and other
authors) and humeral scutes can be extremely variable to generic and specific
level, specially in terms of the size or the length/width of contacts between scutes
as (Pérez-García & Lapparent de Broin 2013) described in detail for Neochelys
spp. Here I consider four characters (179-182) that describe the most common
arrangements between these anterior plastral scutes, excluding autapomorphic
configurations for single species.
180. Extragulars, medial contact of extragular scutes: 0 = absent; 1 = present,
restricting the posterior advance of the gular; 2 = extragulars absent. CA2 (ch 46);
GF1 (ch 170); PE (ch 14). Remarks: see character 179.
181. Extragulars, covering most or at least a small portion of entoplastron: 0 = no; 1 =
yes. CA2 (ch 46); GF1 (ch 170); PE (ch 14). Remarks: see character 179.
182. Extragulars, anterior margin width: 0 = almost the same width as the anterior
margin of gular; 1 = wider than the anterior margin of gular; 2 = much wider than
the anterior margin of gular, which is triangular in shape; 3 = much narrower than
the anterior margin of gular. CA2 (ch 46); GF1 (ch 170); PE (ch 14). Remarks:
see remarks character 179 .
183. Pectorals, pectoral scute on entoplastron: 0 = absent; 1 = present. GF1 (ch 165);
STF (ch 174) (Humeral B).
184. Pectorals, pectoral scute on epiplastron: 0 = absent; 1 = present, crossing the
lateral margin of epiplastron-hyoplastron suture; 2 = present, very anterior to the
epiplastron-hyoplastron suture. GF1 (ch 166). Remarks: a third state was added to
this character.
185. Pectorals, pectoral scute on mesoplastron: 0 = present; 1 = absent. GF1 (ch 167).
186. Inframarginals, inframarginal scutes on bridge: 0 = present; 1 = absent. GF1 (ch
171); JY1 (ch 100, Inframarginal A) & STF (ch 179, 180, and 181)
(Inframarginals, A, B and C). Remarks: primitive condition as for
Kayentachelys aprix.
187. Abdominals, length abdominals versus femorals scutes at the midline of plastron:
0 = abdominals longer or almost same length than femorals: 1 = femorals twice
the length of abdominals; 2 = abdominal scutes do not meet at the midline, due to
the presence of a central fontanelle. GF1 (ch 172); JY1 (ch 98) & STF (ch 177)
(Abdominal A). Remarks: (Gaffney et al. 2006) defined this character in terms of
the length of abdominals versus anal scutes, in my opinion a better definition is in
terms of abdominals versus femorals, avoiding high variations caused by the
depth of the anal notch of xiphiplastra.
Characters excluded or combined from previous studies
From GF1
Character 2. Lacrimal: 0 = present; 1 = absent. Reason to be removed from the list: this
is an uninformative character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles, useful to differentiate stem-
testudines.
Character 3. Lacrimal: lacrimal foramen: 0 = present; 1 = absent. Reason to be removed
from the list: this is an uninformative character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles, useful to
differentiate stem-testudines.
Character 9. Prefrontals-vomer, fissura ethmoidalis: 0 = very wide; 1 = narrower.
Reason to be removed from the list: this is an uninformative character for Pan-
Pleurodiran turtles, polymorphic in cryptodires.
Character 19. Supratemporal, supratemporal bone: 0 = present; 1 = absent. Reason to be
removed from the list: this is an uninformative character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles,
useful to differentiate stem-testudines.
Character 36. Premaxilla, midline dorsal process: 0 = present, meeting nasals; 1 =
absent, or low; 2 = present, at least partially separating nares. Reason to be removed from
the list: apomorphic for Proganochelys quenstedti among Testudinata. Stages 1 and 2 are
very close in all pleurodires and very subjective for separation.
Character 46. Vomer, vomerine teeth: 0 = present; 1 = absent. Reason to be removed
from the list: this is an uninformative character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles, useful to
differentiate stem-testudines.
Character 53. Quadrate, stapes contained in bony canal: 0 = stapes not completely
contained in bone; 1 = stapes completely enclosed by bony incisor columellae auris.
Reason to be removed from the list: character fused in character 56 (states 1 and 3).
Character 61. Quadrate, fully formed cavum tympani: 0 = no; 1 = yes. Reason to be
removed from the list: I combined this character with the character 57 (cavum tympani,
arrangement between the quadrate, squamosal, opisthotic, stapes and Eustachian tube),
because the formation of the cavum tympani is related to the closing of the quadrate and
the incisura columella auris.
Character 62. Quadrate, cavum tympani with acute posterior edge: 0 = no; 1 = acute
edge, also enclosing stapes. Reason to be removed from the list: I combined this character
with the character 57 (cavum tympani, arrangement between the quadrate, squamosal,
opisthotic, stapes and Eustachian tube), state 3.
Character 63. Quadrate, middle ear with complete lateral wall: 0 = no; 1 = yes. Reason
to be removed from the list: this is an uninformative character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles,
useful to differentiate stem-testudines.
Character 64. Quadrate, cavum tympani curved dorsally: 0 = no; 1 = yes. Reason to be
removed from the list: this is an uninformative character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles,
useful to differentiate stem-testudines.
Character 65. Quadrate, covers opisthotic laterally: 0 = no; 1 = yes. Reason to be
removed from the list: this is an uninformative character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles,
useful to differentiate stem-testudines.
Character 66. Quadrate, pocket for stapes articulation: 0 = no; 1 = yes. Reason to be
removed from the list: this is an uninformative character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles,
useful to differentiate stem-testudines.
Character 67. Quadrate, cranioquadrate space: 0 = relatively open; 1 = well defined
canal. Reason to be removed from the list: this is an uninformative character for Pan-
Pleurodiran turtles, useful to differentiate stem-testudines.
Character 81. Supraoccipital, wide occipital plate: 0 = wide occipital plate with
posteriorly concave depression; 1 = narrower occiput. Reason to be removed from the
list: this is an uninformative character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles, useful to differentiate
stem-testudines.
Character 83. Exoccipital, recessus scalae tympani: 0 = not formed in bone; 1 = formed
by bone, also forming fenestra perilymphatica. Reason to be removed from the list: this is
an uninformative character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles, useful to differentiate stem-
testudines.
Character 88. Basioccipital, basioccipital thick: 0 = basioccipital and basisphenoid
relatively thick in cross section; 1 = thinner. Reason to be removed from the list: this is an
uninformative character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles, useful to differentiate stem-
testudines.
Character 91. Prootic, foramen stapedio-temporale: 0 = not a canal; 1 = foramen and
canal. Reason to be removed from the list: this is an uninformative character for Pan-
Pleurodiran turtles, useful to differentiate stem-testudines.
Character 97. Prootic, plane of fenestra ovalis: 0 = inclined from the vertical; 1 = very
close to vertical. Reason to be removed from the list: this is an uninformative character
for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles, useful to differentiate stem-testudines.
Character 98. Opisthotic, processus interfenestralis expanded ventrally: 0 = narrow
ventrally; 1 = expanded ventrally. Reason to be removed from the list: this is an
uninformative character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles, useful to differentiate stem-
testudines.
Character 105. Basisphenoid, interpterygoid vacuity: 0 = large and open; 1 = small or
absent. Reason to be removed from the list: this is an uninformative character for Pan-
Pleurodiran turtles, useful to differentiate stem-testudines.
Character 108. Basisphenoid, skull akinetic: 0 = no, basipterygoid articulation present; 1
= yes, basipterygoid articulation sutured. Reason to be removed from the list: this is an
uninformative character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles, useful to differentiate stem-
testudines.
Character 109. Basisphenoid, cultriform process: 0 = rod-like, thin; 1 = broad, flat,
covered ventrally. Reason to be removed from the list: this is an uninformative character
for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles, useful to differentiate stem-testudines.
Character 111. Basisphenoid, ventral tubercle: 0 = single tubercle formed by
basisphenoid and basioccipital; 1 = paired tubercles; 2 = tubercles absent. Reason to be
removed from the list: this is an uninformative character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles,
useful to differentiate stem-testudines.
Character 112. Columella auris, footplate: 0 = absent, stapes thick; 1 = wide footplate
present, stapes thin. Reason to be removed from the list: this is an uninformative
character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles, useful to differentiate stem-testudines.
Character 130. Shoulder girdle, coracoid foramen: 0 = present; 1 = absent. Reason to be
removed from the list: this is an uninformative character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles,
useful to differentiate stem-testudines.
Character 131. Shoulder girdle, coracoid shape: 0 = coracoid a flat plate; 1 = coracoid
columnar. Reason to be removed from the list: this is an uninformative character for Pan-
Pleurodiran turtles, useful to differentiate stem-testudines.
Character 136. Pelvic girdle, thyroid fenestra: 0 = separate; 1 = confluent. Reason to be
removed from the list: the confluent condition is present in all pleurodires and also
outgroups considered in this study. This character is useful to differentiate stem-
testudines.
Character 140. Carapace, pygal notch: 0 = present; 1 = absent. Reason to be removed
from the list: this is an uninformative character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles, useful to
differentiate stem-testudines. Platychelys oberndorferi has a very shallow pygal notch,
this can be also the case in some cryptodires, however it is not so deep and well defined
as in basal stem-testudines.
Character 161. Plastron, dorsal epiplastral process: 0 = large, reaching or nearly
reaching carapace; 1 = small or absent. Reason to be removed from the list: this is an
uninformative character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles, useful to differentiate stem-
testudines.
Character 169. Plastron, posterior lobe wider than pelvis: 0 = no, pelvis visible in
ventral view; 1 = yes, pelvis hidden by wide posterior lobe. Reason to be removed from
the list: this is an uninformative character for Pan-Pleurodiran turtles, useful to
differentiate stem-testudines.
Character 175. Shell, surface texture: 0 = surface rough with radiating ridges diverging
from posteromedial part (growth center) of vertebral and pleural scale areas; 1 = weakly
granulated polygons; 2 = strongly granulated polygons; 3 = fine, striated ridges; 4 =
smooth; 5 = numerous small pits; 6 = texture as in Dortoka. Reason to be removed from
the list: I agree with the senior author of (Gaffney et al. 2006) in removed this character
because the difficulty of identify objectively and consistently the surface texture of shell
over a wide range of taxa, and I suggest its used only as part of diagnosis of taxa.
From GF2
Character 15. Premaxillae: pinched snout: 0 = absent; 1 = concave outline near
premaxilla-maxilla contact, snout not elongated; 2 = concave outline posterior to
premaxilla-maxilla contact, snout elongated. Reason to be removed from the list: the
pinched snout is a feature resulting of the anterior projection of the prefrontals over the
aperture narium and also of their dorsal inflation, this character is better defined by the
way that the prefrontals cover the apertura narium externa (character 5, this study).
Character 18. Maxillae: triturating surface convexity: 0 = absent or shallow; 1 = deep.
Reason to be removed from the list: apomorphic for two species of Bairdemys genus.
Character 21. Maxillae, meet broadly on midline: 0 = no; 1 = yes. Reason to be removed
from the list: extremely homoplastic as was pointed out by (Gaffney et al. 2011)).
Character 27. Palatines, orbitalis posterior pocket in septum orbitotemporale: 0 = absent;
1 = present. Reason to be removed from the list: the best specimen figured by (Gaffney et
al. 2011) for observation of this character is in my opinion Mogharemys blanckenhorni
(Pag 121, Fig 50), however, the called “posterior pocket” is not really a well defined
feature at the fossa orbitalis, and not remarkable different from the shape of the anterior
surface of the septum orbitotemporale of extant podocnemidids. I keep this character out
because it is not very well defined or illustrated by (Gaffney et al. 2011) CT images of
stereogynis could help to test the validity of this character and to reach a better definition.
Character 49. Prootic, foramen posterius canalis carotici interni: 0 = in prootic; 1 = in
basisphenoid with cavum pterygoidei: 2 = variably in pterygoid, quadrate basisphenoid; 3
= pterygoid and basisphenoid. Reason to be removed from the list: character included in
the redefined character 73 this study.
Character 67. Carapace, costal 2 anterior edge thickened near buttress: 0 = no; 1 = yes.
Reason to be removed from the list: the definition of the character is poor in terms not
only of lacking figures or photographs illustrating the thickened, but also of how to
differentiate from the average thickness of the costal bones.
From CA1
Character 37. Surangular, well extended anteriorly: 0 = absent; 1 = present. Reason to
be removed from the list: after examination of more specimens of extant podocnemidids,
I conclude that there is strong variability of this character in the degrees of the anterior
extension of surangular bone.
Character 40. Dentary, narrow and elongated ridge, located in the medial margin on the
ventral surface: 0 = absent; 1 = present. Reason to be removed from the list: this is an
autapomorphic character of Cerrejonemys wayuunaiki among Pan-Pleurodira.
Character 49. Carapace, lateral thickness of the shell: 0 = =20 mm; 1 ==20 mm. Reason
to be removed from the list: this is an autapomorphic character of Cerrejonemys
wayuunaiki among Pan-Pleurodira.
From CA2
Character 9. Prefrontal, prefrontal-postorbital contact: 0 = absent; 1 = present. Reason to
be removed from the list: this is an autapomorphic character of Carbonemys cofrinii
among Pan-Pleurodira.
From PE1
Character 7. Overlap of the marginal 1 on the latero-anterior margin of the nuchal: 0 =
marginal 1 overlapping more than one third of the latero-anterior margin; 1 = marginal 1
overlapping less than one third of the latero-anterior margin. Reason to be removed from
the list: this becomes a redundant character with character 152 of this study, and it is
variable at generic and specific level, depending of the inclination of the posterior margin
of marginal 1.
Character 12. Ratio between the length of the entoplastron and its distance with the
pectoro-abdominal sulcus: 0 = entoplastral length longer than two times that distance; 1
= entoplastral length less than two times that distance. Reason to be removed from the
list: the second state is scored for three species of Neochelys: N. eoceanica, N.
zamoraensis, N. salmanticensis however from the figure and photos provide in (Broin
1977) and (Jiménez-Fuentes 1968; Jiménez-Fuentes 1992) it is clear that the differences
are not significant and can fall easily inside ontogenetic or intraspecific variations.
Character 13. Lateral margins of the posterior plastral lobe: 0 = rounded; 1 = straight.
Reason to be removed from the list: this is a highly variable character in individuals of
same species of extant podocnemidids, and apomorphic for Neochelys zamoraensis as
scored in Table 2 of (Pérez-García & Lapparent de Broin 2013).
Character 15. Length of the dorsal shell: 0 = near 25 cm; 1 = greater than 35 cm. Reason
to be removed from the list: I avoid the use of this character that can be related to
ontogenetic stages, sexual dimorphisms variations, and an affected by a poorly
documented number of individuals for some species.

Character 8 (Character 7 this study)
Araripemys barretoi, Laganemys tenerensis from (0) to (?)
Pelomedusa subrufa, Pelusios castaneus, Dirqadim schaefferi from (0) to (-)
Reason for the change: if the vomer is absent or not preserved, this character should be
code as not applicable (-) for those lacking the vomer, and (?) for those with dubious
presence/absence or contact with the prefrontal.

Phosphatochelys tedfordi, Ummulisani rutgersensis, Rhothonemys brinkmani, Nigeremys
gigantean, Arenila krebsi from (0) to (1)
Reason for the change: the condition for all these taxa, following the redefinition of
character states made here, fit better in (1) than in (0).
Character 16 (Character 16 this study)
Kayentachelys aprix from (0) to (?)
Reason for the change: as the specimen is preserved is not completely clear if the contact
exists or not.
Character 39 (Character 25 this study)
Phosphatochelys tedfordi, Ummulisani rutgersensis from (2) to (5)
Reason for the change: a contact between maxilla and quadrate with very shallow cheek
emargination is present for both taxa. See also the character remarks for discussion about
states changes.
Character 27 (Character 30 this study)
Laganemys tenerensis from (0) to (?)
Reason for the change: the orbits are still filled with matrix, avoiding the observation of
this character.
Character 35 (Character 38 this study)
Atolchelys lepida from (1) to (0)
Reason for the change: photographs and figures presented for this taxon by (Romano et
al. 2014) show absence of deep and rounded pits as those exhibit by other bothremydids.
Character 45 (Character 46 this study)
Laganemys tenerensis from (?) to (1)

Character 76 (Character 74 this study)
Laganemys tenerensis from (0) to (?)
Atolchelys lepida from (1) to (?)
Reason for the change: both species lack of skulls enough prepared/preserved to be able

available for public access and corroboration.
Character 77 (Character 75 this study)
Ummulisani rutgersensis from (0/1) to (?)
Rhothonemys brinkmani from (0) to (?)

Dear Editors of the Royal Society Open Science,
On behalf of my co-authors I submit the responses to the referee’s comments on our manuscript
referred above. We would like to thank the referees for their insightful suggestions that
considerably improved the quality of this manuscript and the editors for their efficient handling
of the review process. We revised all of those suggestions and felt that just a few needed a reply,
which you can find below. All the minor suggestions were readily accepted and changed
accordingly in the manuscript and supplementary files. We also updated all electronic
supplementary files, including the newest version of the phylogenetic matrix, which can still be
found at the same GitHub repository provided during the submission process.
While reviewing the manuscript we found some errors in the subtrees employed in the
diversification analyses. We corrected those and ran the analyses again resulting in slightly
distinct results. We updated the description of these results and the discussion. It is important to
add, though, that the differences are minimal and do not change our discussion or conclusions.
Please, don’t hesitate in contact me for any issues.
Sincerely yours,
Gabriel S. Ferreira

Comments to the Author(s)
Excellent methodologies, however some issues with the characters and scoring. Please see the
comments in the two PDF files (Main document and Supplemental). Hope you find my
comments useful and in a constructive way.
Sincerely yours,
Specific comments:
Reply: All minor specific comments not addressed below were accepted and changed
accordingly on the manuscript.
Comment - P03, L87: I think only few of these 23 are really new characters, see my comments
on the Supplemental PDF attached.
Reply: Thank you for the thoroughly review on the character list. We revised all comments on
the supplementary material related to the novelty of those characters and we agreed with the
referee in several of his suggestions, restating that sixteen of those characters previously
considered new were actually proposed somewhere else. However, we noticed that the reported
number of new characters on the previous version of the manuscript was wrong; there were
thirty-three new characters, not twenty-three. Thus, removing sixteen characters from this list,
results in eighteen new characters. We changed the text to reflect this.
Comment - P03,L91: Checking the scoring principally for the "new" characters I found a
couple of issues with some taxa. They are minor for sure, but you should consider to update the
character-taxa matrix and possibly to run part of the phylogenetic analysis. Painful I know :(
Reply: We checked all the suggestions and agreed with all the issues suggested by the referee.
We also made illustrations for every new character (provided as three plates at the end of the
supplementary file), as suggested by the referee. It is important to note that changing the scoring
of some characters as proposed by the referee (and incorporated on our updated phylogenetic
matrix) does not alter the topology or the results of the phylogenetic analysis.
Comment - P03,L100: any impact if the replicates number is increased? For example 10000?
Reply: No, there is no impact on the search if we increase the number of replications to more
than 2000. We tested that by the standard procedure of gradually increasing the number of
iterations (e.g., 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000) and checking the number of trees found, as well as
the number of times the best solution was found. This is common practice, so we left it out of
the methods section of the manuscript. See also the reply to Upchurch in pages 5 and 6.
Comment - P06,L299: What if you run an analysis including only skull based taxa?, same
finding?
Reply: Thanks for the suggestion. Although this is an interesting question – checking the
phylogenetic signal of distinct morphological partitions – we did not think it would be much
relevant for the present contribution. Here, we wanted to evaluate all the available
morphological information, including the largest sample of extant and extinct taxa, to employ
the resulting hypothesis in the biogeographical and diversification analyses. Just in case, we ran
this subset matrix as an exploratory analysis and the results are roughly the same, with some
points of higher uncertainty (i.e., larger politomies than in the original hypothesis), likely related
to the exclusion of Platychelys oberndorferi, that influences the polarization. We believe that to
better evaluate this subset matrix it would be important to include some cryptodires in the
outgroup as well, resulting in a more accurate polarization of the characters. Nevertheless, the
relation of most of the ingroup is only slightly changed; for example, Caninemys tridentata
remains as the sister-taxon to Cerrejonemys + Podocnemis.
Comment - P07,L336-337: I agreed with most of the conclusions of your analyses, however, I
am also a bit skeptical in part because there is not a stratigraphic sequence preserving
pleurodirans for which you can really track less than 1 Ma changes including K-Pg event with
proved identification of the boundary. Paleogene taxa usually came from sequences that are
couple millions after the event early to middle Paleocene, but not necessarly K-Pg +1Ma or less
time frame.
Reply: This is an important issue, indeed, and it certainly raises some skepticism regarding this
conclusion. Nevertheless, the available data suggests that the K-Pg mass extinction did not
greatly affect the diversity of pleurodires. New data can certainly contradict our hypothesis, and
we hope to see better-sampled stratigraphic sequences soon that can contribute to this issue, but
until then little more can be said with higher certainty. For this reason, we chose to use a
conservative tone when discussing this (and the Eocene-Oligocene) extinction event.
Comment - P08,L366-373: This seems to be repetitive, as you already mention in detail this in
the introduction part. I suggest to make shorter and go straight to how your findings support or
reject any of these two hypotheses.
Reply: We made this paragraph shorter as suggested by the referee.
Comment - P09,L422-425: You should consider also paleoclimate conditions. Latitude
restrictions have been also controlled by climatic condition along the Mesozoic and Cenozoic.
Plus, paleoecological conditions too, I formulated some of these factors briefly and "speculative
form" in Cadena et al., 2012 Carbonemys paper, body size trend discussion.
Reply: We agree with the referee that paleoclimate conditions should have affected the
distribution of chelids during the Cretaceous period. Our aim when discussing the southward
movement of the Antarctic continent during the Early Cretaceous was to imply the temperatures
decreased in that area, limiting the survival of turtles there. Accordingly, we also added a brief
statement and a citation on the global decreasing of temperatures during the Late Cretaceous
that, together with the paleolatitude, could have contributed to the issue.
Comment - P09-10, L468-469,474-475: Similar patterns seems to be occurred win stem-
pleurodires for example Notoemys
Reply: We added a comment on that in the discussion section.
Comments on the supplementary material regarding the characters section about the
novelty of some characters.
Character 38. SQ, lateral surface.
Comment: This is somehow resembled by character 25, Gaffney et al., 2006. which is related
to the posteroventral vertical flange and the absence/presence of an antrum postoticum. I also
think the definition of state 0 should be "convex to slightly flat" instead of smooth, because in
both groups chelids and podocnemidids the lateral surface is smooth.
Reply: This is not the same as the vertical flange of Gaffney et al., (2006) character 25, nor is it
related to the antrum postoticum. This character is related to the origin area of the depressor
madibulae musculature on the lateral surface of the squamosal, which in some taxa is well-
marked resulting in a concave surface, and in others leaves no clear traces. We agree, though,
with the suggested change in the definition, and made it accordingly.
Character 55. MX, lingual ridge.
Comment: Where exactly? checking several specimens of Peltocephalus and the photos of
Euraxemys from Gaffney et al., 2006 seem to me that both exhibit a shallow to lingual ridge,
are you refering to the premaxilla-maxilla contact region?. Definition of characters and
particularly new characters should be combined with figures that the most possible clear
explanation, otherwise it can create missunderstanding or wrong future scorings.
Reply: This character refers to the posterior half of the lingual ridge, which can be very shallow
or indistinguishable from its surroundings or well-defined. We changed the definition
accordingly and provide a figure to illustrate that.
Character 66. VO, VO-PM contact.
Comment: There is an old character that is very similar to this one. Joyce and Bell, 2004,
character 29 (Figs 55-59).
Reply: This character is related to the participation of the vomer in the triturating surface. We
recognize there may be some overlap with our new character, but these are not the same. The
vomer may reach the premaxillae without participating in the triturating surface (e.g.,
Araiochelys hirayamai and Bauruemys elegans). Hence, we still consider them distinct
characters and ours as a new character.
Character 215. Position of plastron related to carapace in ventral view.
Comment: Above which peripherals? 1? 2?, 1&2? you need to improve the definition of this
character. I think the scoring for N. laticentralis should be "?' and no "0". the anterior lobe of
specimens of this taxon are particularly incomplete or badly preserved at this region.
Reply: This is related to the posterior portion of the plastron, not the anterior. We changed the
definition of the character to make it clearer.
Character 235. PLA, humeral scale
Comment: See my discussion on this character in Character 179, Cadena 2015
Reply: The discussion is regarding high variability of characters about the size of the humeral,
gular and extragular scales, to a generic and specific level. Although this is generally true, in our
matrix the states are not highly variable; just a few taxa are scored as state 0, for example. Also,
even if it were a highly variable character, we do not consider this a good reason not to include
it in a phylogenetic analysis, because this kind of character may be useful at some specific clade
of a tree. Hence, we kept this character as it is.
Character 239. PLA, pubic scar shape
Comment: I think you really need to check more specimens and see the extreme variability that
pleurodires have before define new characters. See Figures of posterior plastral lobe at the end
of this PDF (after Pelusio castaneous figure), sub-oval, oval, and cranial projection are very
variable, depending of the level at which the scar is observed. Pill-shaped?, you really need
more details, pills come in different presentations perfectly circular to long capsules with
rounded tips or nearly acute tips, etc. Again, figures or photos of specimens comparing the
different states are critical for the definition of new characters.
Reply: We agree with the referee that this character may depend on the level at which the scar
is observed. This is especially true for state 2: the referred projection cannot be seen in some
specimens due to this observational variation. We excluded this state from the character
definition. The distinction between ‘sub-oval’ and ‘pill-shaped’ is observable, although the
definition itself was not the best. Thus, we also changed the definition to make it clearer the
variation we meant for this character, adding quantitative criteria to it.
Referee 2 (Paul Upchurch)
Comments to the Author(s):
This is an interesting and high-quality paper that I'm happy to recommend for publication.
However, I have found several minor problems and errors which are listed below. These need to
be corrected before acceptance. I also have one more substantial comment with regard to the
protocol used to carry out the phylogenetic analyses. Again, this needs to be addressed before
acceptance.
Specific comments:
Reply: All minor suggestions, such as linguistic changes, were accepted and we made the
changes in the manuscript. Below, we comment on the other suggestions.
Comment - 3. Lines 99-103: ‘The resulting matrix was analyzed under the parsimony criterion
in TNT v. 1.1 [44] via an heuristic search with the following settings: 2000 replicates of
Wagner trees, random seed = 0, Tree Bisection Reconnection (TBR) for branch-swapping, hold
= 20, and collapse of zero length branches according to rule ‘1’ of TNT. The MPTs (most
parsimonious trees) found in this first round of the analysis were subject of a second round of
TBR. A strict consensus tree, decay (Bremer support) and resampling…’
This is not the best way to search for the most parsimonious trees and to collect all such
topologies. Instead, I recommend using the protocol proposed by Mannion et al 2013 in their
paper in zoological Journal of the Linnean Society en LusoTitan. In this paper, the authors
suggest first applying the new technology search in TNT. This has very efficient algorithms for
finding examples of the most parsimonious trees, but it will not necessarily find all or most the
the most parsimonious trees. Once this new technology search has been applied, the resulting
most parsimonious trees can then be used as the starting trees for the TBR search as outlined
above. The latter will help two find most or all of the remaining MPTs.
Reply: Thanks for this comment. We followed the protocol suggested by Goloboff et al. (2008)
when they presented the program TNT. They suggest “For most medium-sized data sets, the
best approach is to run a number of random addition sequences (RAS), each with TBR1 branch-
swapping, until the best score is hit 10 to 20 times independently. This is usually sufficient for
all global optima (‘‘islands’’, as they were once called) to be found.” (Goloboff et al. 2008:780).
Medium-sized data sets includes up to 100 taxa approximately. Our matrix has 101 taxa and
when we run the Traditional Search, in the first round of TBR the program hit 388 times of
2000 replicates the shortest trees, so we can be sure our search is not stuck on an island. If hits
are under 20, it would be better to apply New Technology Search algorithms, but our data set
works well with Traditional Search. We added how many times TNT found the shortest trees
(hits) in Results.
Comment - P5, L130-131: ‘…approach). Accordingly, each time sliced tree is composed of a
subset of the original tree containing taxa of the same age or older than the given period, added
of the ghost lineages of younger taxa.’
The phrasing is incorrect and confusing here.
Reply: We changed the phrasing for “Accordingly, each time sliced tree is composed of a
subset of the original tree containing taxa of the same age or older than the given period, in
addition to the ghost lineages of younger taxa.”

Dear Editors of the Royal Society Open Science,
On behalf of my co-authors I submit the responses to the referee’s comment on our manuscript
referred above. We would like to thank both referees for their throughout reviews that
considerably improved the quality of this manuscript and the editors for their efficient handling
of the review process. In this round, only Referee 1 (Edwin Cadena) noticed two mistakes in the
manuscript, that we corrected in the revised version. We revised all the figure and tables
captions, as well as the end statements to accommodate them to the journal style. We also
revised and updated all electronic supplementary files, which can still be found at the same
GitHub repository provided during the submission process and in the revised manuscript.
Please, don’t hesitate in contact me for any issues.
Sincerely yours,

Comments to the Author(s)
Almost there!. Great job fixing characters issues and creating the figures for the new ones.
However, I am skeptical that using a character-taxon matrix that has been slithly modified in
the scoring of some characters for example (from 0 to 0&1) or from (0 to 1) in some taxa, you
still obtaining the same parsimony indexes values CI, RI, HI. So please double check, I explain
in more detail this issue in the PDF attached
In the supplemental material (Figures part) please change "femural" by "femoral"
Cheers,
Specific comments:
Comment - P03,L16-18: Great that you updated the scoring following my suggestions. Doing
this your new character-taxon matrix can still producing the same tree topologies, however I
am skeptical on you obtaining the same parsimony indexes values.
and
Comment - P12,L200: These are the same as in the original analysis!!!, however you have
changed the scoring for several characters from 0 to 0&1 or from 0 to 1 in the new matrix
provided. These "minor" changes for sure will affect the parsimony indexes, so please make
sure you really re-run the analysis using the new update version of the matrix and make sure the
MPTs, CI and RI according to. I also suggest to remove the notes marked in some characters in
the Nexus file, so that will make easier to replicate and use the matrix that you produce in future
studies. For example some characters appear with 1* coding., and that creates conflicts to be
read by PAUP or TNT.
Reply: Thank you very much for this comment. We had re-run the analyses after the first
review changes and checked the MPTs (still 36 MPTs), but failed to see and report the
differences between the number of steps and the consistency and retention indexes. They indeed
had some slight changes! The number of steps changed from 1129 to 1128 and the RI from
0.749 to 0.750, but the CI remained with the same value: 0.290. We changed the text
accordingly. About the notes on characters in the Nexus file, we removed everything, leaving
only the comments on the characters' name, which are their reference, in the revised matrix
provided at the GitHub repository ( to avoid this kind of potential conflict.
