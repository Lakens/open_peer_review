This paper describes a reachability analysis that can provide a set of bounds to the dynamic of a
stochastic differential equation representing stochastic chemical kinetics. The approach uses a
zono-type formulation that allows for uncertainty, say in the initial conditions of the rate
constants, to be tracked. I think the ideas are interesting but the discussion, lack of care in the
details and the rather poor discussion on the underlying stochastic model leaves a great deal to
be desired.
If the following substantial issues are addressed carefully and well then I would recommend
publication, but I would have expected a much better effort from these two authors.

The reviewer confirms that the manuscript was updated based on reviewers’ comments. In the

However, given the readership of the journal is a broader audience, the reviewer would

biological reactions. For example, the parameter values should include units and they should be
justified especially for the first two examples. The unit of the horizontal axis in Fig. 2 should be

This paper describes a reachability analysis that can provide a set of bounds to the
dynamic of a stochastic differential equation representing stochastic chemical
kinetics. The approach uses a zono-type formulation that allows for uncertainty, say
in the initial conditions of the rate constants, to be tracked. I think the ideas are
interesting but the discussion, lack of care in the details and the rather poor
discussion on the underlying stochastic model leaves a great deal to be desired.
If the following substantial issues are addressed carefully and well, then I
would recommend publication, but I would have expected a much better effort from
these two authors.
While we are pleased that the referee has high expectations of our work, we, of
course, hate to disappoint. We are therefore also thankful for them to point out
possible improvements, and we hope that they will now agree that the manuscript
has improved over the previous version. That said, we found the requests of this
reviewer at times hard to meet, for they wanted simultaneously an easier
presentation as well as more technical detail. Therefore, we have decided to keep
the presentation in the manuscript as straightforward as possible, but have added
more references and pointers to the relevant literature.
Page 3, Linear Noise approximation
This discussion assumes way too much from the reader who is unlikely to be not
particularly familiar with some of the stochastic niceties.
Explain the form of S and the propensity functions with a specific example.
We amended the first paragraph of the section on Linear Noise Approximation to
provide more introduction to stochastic model formalism. We have also added an
example in the controlled stochastic gene expression case in section 4, where we
present the steps of transforming a reaction network model into a stochastic system
and a deterministic ODE set.
State that the W_j are independent
Explain what is meant by W_j(a_j(\phi(t)))
State whether (2.3) is Ito or Stratonovich form
The text describing Eq. (2.3) now includes the above information.
Discuss why this stochastic model is different from the Chemical Langevin equation
that has square root terms.
The main point in our manuscript is to derive sets of ODEs to replace stochastic
formalism (such as SDEs). This is relatively flexibly achieved in both LNA and MEA,
and both can be applied to very general stochastic systems. We now emphasize this
intention in the manuscript. Because of this reason, the SDE part in (2.3) is really
only used for the derivation of (2.4), while in most application the CLE is used to
derive trajectories of the system. Also, (2.3) only captures the “noise” dynamics in an
approximate sense, whereas the CLE, of course, would capture the noise more
comprehensively.
Reconsider the first equation on page 4 as vectors and a matrix are mixed. The
system should be in vector form.
In the revised version, we introduce a vectorised form of the involved matrices to
match the dimensions in the equation. We also give the equations in the first
example to illustrate this formalism.
Page 4 moment expansion approximations
The second paragraph in this section is impenetrable and lacking important details.
How are the consecutive Taylor series expansions used?
What inaccuracies are introduced when applying moment closure?
Please make this clearer, the authors must do better than this.
Our intention with this section was to provide a second example of approximation
methods that might be used in case the LNA is found inadequate for a system/ the
user wants to explore multiple options. As we wish to keep the reachable set
computation as the focus of this article, and a detailed derivation of the moment
expansion algorithm has already been given in previous publications, we have
decided to reduce the amount of detail in this section and only give a general
overview of the main ideas behind the algorithm. We added a paragraph at the end
of the section directing the reader to our prior articles and to our publicly available
package implementing the method. We believe this automated implementation will
be more beneficial to potential users.
Page 5 Reachable set computation
Eqns (3.2, 3.3) – it is As
The equations are now corrected.
The discussion on lines 27 to 35 and 41 to 52 is poor. The key idea is to write
X(t+h)=x(t)+\int ……ie the Green function representation.
I do not understand the discussion on bloating. Lines 36 to 40 are incomprehensible.
We have now extended and restructured this section, and hope that in its revised
form the logical steps discussed in it are comprehensible. We included Figure S2 in
the supplementary material that illustrates the main steps of reachable set
computational on a toy model.
Page 6, lines 9 to 22
In describing U what happens if some of the initial conditions are close to the
boundaries such as near 0?
The algorithm can be used with an arbitrary interval of u values, in theory even a
range including negative values is handled correctly – in applications in electrical
engineering where the input is an additive noise term centred at 0, this is exactly the
case. For biologically relevant values, we show an example toy system with input
values from the range [0, 100] in Figure S2, and our first example of Section 4 also
allows the input to take 0.
Page 7, Nonlinear systems
What happens if there is a rapidly changing component (stiff chemistry)? Then it
may not be appropriate to have a constant stepsize and the stepsize should adapt.
The method proposed for linearization can be easily adapted for variable time-steps.
Furthermore, the central trajectory (c_i) around which the system is linearized in
each step can be computed with a higher-order method that offers adaptive stepsize
(e.g. by ode45 in Matlab). This way one can obtain a series of central values and
time-steps, based on which the first-order linearization is later executed.
We have included a paragraph at the end of the section describing this possible
extension to our proposed method.
Page 8,
in the first example give the defining 5 ODEs.
We added this together with the derivation of the stochastic descriptors.
Give another study where there is uncertainty in all the parameters.
We included an additional figure in supplementary material (Figure S3), showing the
reachable set obtained when (i) both degradation rates and (ii) all parameters have
uncertainty, together with the previously obtained reachable sets. We found that
degradation rates have a more profound effect on the overall extent of explorable
space, which is know included in the main manuscript.

length 7.
We thank the reviewer for the thorough review; we have fixed the indexing of the
parameter values and their assignment in the revised manuscript.
Page 10, second paragraph
I do not understand the comments about getting negative values. A well defined
stochastic model would respect the appropriate boundary conditions. In other
words if you do this properly you should not get negative values.!
As we address this issue in the discussion, obtaining a reachable set that includes
negative values is due to the symmetric properties of zonotopes – only centrally
symmetric shapes can be captured by this formalism, while the systems might not
follow ‘symmetric dynamics’ at certain points. For example, in the case shown in Fig.
3, the initial states N_0 = 0.45 and N_0 = 0.75 are both 0.15 units away from the
initial state set centre, but they lead to final Nanog amounts of ~0.09 and ~15. The
negative values are due to the symmetric counterpart of the change 0.75 <U+F0E0> 15.
Furthermore, as the system under study at this point is an ODE set, negative values
are not excluded by the numerical methods used, and we do not wish to restrict the
system, as for some quantities (e.g. covariance of two species) they might actually be
correct.
We agree that avoiding such over-approximation would further improve the
reachable set prediction, however, the zonotope formalism offers other advantages
(especially in terms of computational speed) that still make this approach efficient to
tackle even such complicated cases. As we discuss in the last section, the efficiency
can be used to carry out a multi-step analysis once issues of bistability or other
asymmetry have been identified. We believe that the present paper provides a
useful tool to tackle the problem of reachability in stochastic systems, and we hope
that it will serve as a stepping stone towards further improvements in this important
area of research.

Comments to the Author(s)
The reviewer confirms that the manuscript was updated based on reviewers’
comments. In the revised manuscript, the authors also included moment expansion
method, which allows for the analysis of skewed non-Gaussian distributions. The
technical presentation became clear, and the mathematical contents are correct.
However, given the readership of the journal is a broader audience, the reviewer
would recommend to further improve the application examples by discussing the
relevance with real biological reactions. For example, the parameter values should
include units and they should be justified especially for the first two examples.
We have now included a discussion on the choice and the interpretation of the rate
parameters used in our study. Our major aim in the first two examples was to study
general schemes that can provide insight into numerous actual systems. Therefore,
we use normalized parameter values that reflect general relationships better and
might be scaled to match a specific biochemical network. We now give units for the
rate parameters. We also provided additional details in the first example to explain
how a set of biological reactions is translated into equations studied in reachability
analysis.
The unit of the horizontal axis in Fig. 2 should be clarified.
We now added this information to the caption of Figure 2.
