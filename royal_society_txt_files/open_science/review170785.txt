Identification of the Beagle-2 Lander on Mars.
This is a fascinating paper discussing the whereabouts of the „Beagle-2“ spacecraft, which was
lost during a landing attempt on Mars in 2003. The paper has been prepared by experts in the
topic, knowledgeable about the engineering aspects of the spacecraft and the landing as well as in
the interpretation of space image data.
I suggest that the paper be published, and have only minor suggestions for improvement of the
manuscript.

I think the manuscript has been significantly improved and acceptable for publication, but I have
a few residual comments for the authors’ consideration.
1. p. 9, bottom, states that the SRR technique produces “up to a factor of 5 enhancement in
resolution.” This implies a 25 x improvement is information content, yet only 5 images were
available for Beagle-2, so this seems misleading.
2. P. 10, section 2.3. The authors now use actual data for color analysis rather than the “RGB”
color with a synthetic blue channel. However, they state that the EDRs were used—these are the
raw images without any radiometric calibrations. The map-projected RDRs contain calibrated
data. I suspect they actually used the RDRs, and should just make that edit.

s is a worthwhile contribution that should be accepted for publication following
isions.
jor Comments:
1. I’m not convinced by the claim that a 4th solar panel failed to deploy. We see
different panels light up in different HiRISE images with different viewing angles, so
these must be specular reflections. (We can see weak specular reflections even from
dust-covered surfaces, as with Spirit rover.) We were lucky that 3 panels happened
to be oriented such that specular reflections were possible given the range of
pointing angles acquired, so it would not be at all surprising is the fourth panel also
was open, but we just didn’t get a specular reflection enabling detection. There is
no discussion at all of specular reflections in this paper, which pretends that the
lander was only recognized after “superresolution” processing. But the main
conclusion still holds that EDL worked correctly (better than Schiaparelli).
2. The story they tell about how Beagle 2 was discovered is misleading. The true story
is much more interesting, plus it's the truth! See details below.
3. Section 2.2, the description of super-resolution processing, is self-serving and
misleading. The keys to clear identification of Beagle-2 included a special FFT
cleaning that we applied at the University of Arizona (see
https://www.uahirise.org/ESP_039308_1915), and careful comparison of the
images by Tim Parker at JPL (a co-author), showing that the bright spots appeared
to move—which we interpreted as specular reflections off of different panels in
different images. The super-res processing destroys this key information by
merging them into a single image, and played no role in understanding what
happened to Beagle 2. It is included in the paper as a way of advertising a technique
developed at UCL. This section should be deleted or shortened.
4. The authors do not seem to understand the HiRISE colour bandpasses, referring to
them as RGB, and it isn’t clear than the colour analysis is meaningful.
5. This paper ignores an earlier false identification of Beagle 2 in a fresh bouldery
crater, which received much publicity. Stuart Hurst about drove me crazy
requesting more and more HiRISE images so the superresolution processing could
prove his elaborate theory correct. Apparently the UCL group worked on this, so it
seems odd that it isn’t mentioned at all in this paper.
nor comments (or expanded explanation of points above):

ISE experiment is described in McEwen et al., 2007, which the authors cite but perhaps haven’t

says “First impact on the ground at a predicted 16 m/s released the main chute approximately 8

tion 2 describes in detail how the authors searched for and located Beagle-2, but makes it
nds like this was an official effort of the Beagle-2 team. It didn’t start out that way. Beagle-2
first located by Michael Croon, a former engineer for ESA (and co-author on this paper), based
suggestions he entered in HiWish as a member of the general public. Here are the science
onales he entered into HiWish with his image suggestions:
gestion 96818 entered on 16 February 2014 by Michael Croon, Science rational: “HiRISE has
ered almost the entire Beagle 2 three sigma landing ellipse. Unfortunately, no hardware
been found yet. One of the rare coverage gaps is a streak roughly 2 km wide east of
_025607_1915 and west of ESP_030908_1915.” We acquired ESP_037145_1915 on 29
e 2014 in response to the suggestion from Michael Croon.
gestion 107942 entered 22 November 2014: “I located Beagle 2 hardware candidates

pectively. There might be a third object with some freedom to move (deflated airbag or
achute?) near the lower right corner. The pixel coordinates of the putative lander are:

tion 2.3 cannot be evaluated because the authors may be confused about HiRISE colour
dpasses. HiRISE does not have RGB colors. We do create a color products called “RGB”,
it uses the broadband (“RED”) as red and the broad blue-green bandpass as green, and
derive a synthetic Blue channel to display as blue (See Delamere et al. 2010). If the “B:R”
ios they described were based on this synthetic blue band, then the colour information
eaningless. Perhaps they actually compared the BG:RED channels? If so, then the
und-based colors they cite must be adjusted accordingly for comparison, as these are
red and blue bandpasses.

Open Science, August 2017
We thank the 3 reviewers for constructive reviews which have enabled us to improve the manuscript.

Point 1 Solar Panel Deployment, specular reflections: The text e.g. section 2.4, abstract etc has been
edited to highlight the importance of specular reflections in considering the images and we note that
there is no one definitive answer yet as to how many solar panels have deployed, e.g. it could be 3 or
all. This is the topic of a follow up ‘Engineering ‘ paper which is in preparation.
Point 2 Michael Croon’s Contribution: The text P7 end of first paragraph has been rewritten to make
clear Croons’ key role in filling the HiRISE gap and first identifying the lander.
Other Misidentified Beagle 2 ‘sitings’: We have chosen to focus on this bona fide characterisation
rather than other people’s ideas. If others wish to have their ideas submitted to peer review then that
would be their choice rather than ours.
Red:Blue-Green ratios from HiRISE images: We have recalculated (UCL team) the R:BG ratios of the
lander and local rocks, soil etc based on colour HiRISE EDR Images (appendix spreadsheet). These
strengthen the lander identification (section 2.3) as the values of the lander 0.995 is distinct from rocks
and soil (2.0) and similar to previous landers MER, Phoenix, analysed by us in the same way. This is
noted in the revised text and recorded in the Appendix Excel workbook.
Super Resolution Techniques: Section 2.2. has been rewritten and shortened a bit. We now describe
the HiRISE Georeferencing technique first and note that this was part of the early firm identification
of the lander, with the SRR technique developed by UCL coming later. We have deleted the 6.25 cm
pixel size sentence from the SRR section.
Figure 14: We now have 2 versions A and B in this figure, the latter without the Beagle2 outline
superimposed.

We have added the exact co-ordinates of the lander (bottom of P10 and Conclusions): ‘In order to
precisely determine the exact co-ordinates of the lander we have used a HiRISE-CTX-HRSC co
registration technique described in [21]. Based on the HiRSE ESP_039308_1915 with CTX
D19_034455_1918_XN_11N269W and with HRSCHh1193_0001, the exact co-ordinates are
90.431386ºE, 11.528791ºN (we have rounded this off to about m-scale accuracy).
The recalculated ellipse P4, L10 was done with Monte Carlo simulations and more accurate
atmospheric entry position data.
Possible movement of the rear cover is illustrated by the arrows in Fig. 10 HiRISE images. We also now
include an animated GIF of this movement in the online appendix.
Minor changes in the wording made as suggested for clarification. References checked.
Media Summary
The 2003 Beagle 2 Mars lander has been identified close to the predicted target in the Isidis region of
Mars. Beagle 2 was an exobiology lander designed to look for isotopic and compositional signs of life
on Mars, as part of the ESA Mars Express mission. The identification was possible through examination
of multiple HiRISE camera images taken from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The size (about 1.5
m), distinctive multilobed shape, red:blue-green average ratio of 1.0 distinct from the local Martian
rocks, dust and soil (typically red:blue-green ratio of 2.1), and location close to the centre of the planned
landing ellipse led to the Beagle 2 identification. The shape of the imaged lander, although to some
extent masked by the specular reflections in the various images, is consistent with deployment of the
lander lid and then some or all solar panels. Failure to fully deploy the panels – which may have been
caused by damage during landing – would have prohibited communication between the lander and Mars
Express and commencement of science operations. A key role was played by Citizen Scientist Michael
Croon who spotted a gap in the HiRISE coverage over the landing ellipse, and noted the possible
presence of the lander in that image when it was taken. His idea has been subsequently proven using
multiple images taken over the same area.
