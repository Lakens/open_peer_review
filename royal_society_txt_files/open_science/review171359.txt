Overall, this is a very good piece of work. The technique used is going to become standard in my
view relatively rapidly. The writing is generally good although I think at times the authors try to
write a bit “impressively” rather than strive for simplicity and clarity. I have put a large number
of comments, both conceptual and editorial, directly on the MS. I really have only one
substantive comment that I think needs to be addressed and it concerns the rationale/context/set
up for the study. (Appendix A)
In my view the rationale for the study is a bit out of step. I concur completely that measuring
heart rate is a really cool thing to do but not for the reasons you set out. A decline in Tb has long
been used as a proxy to assess entry into torpor (or heterothermy). But it is not a drop in Tb per
se that saves energy it is the controlled reduction in metabolic rate (MR). In the tropics where Ta
is mostly high, it is really hard to differentiate between the potentially small changes in Tb that
occur with torpor or the small Tb-Ta differentials. It is just not possible for animals to get colder
than Ta...but they may still derive considerable energy savings from dropping MR – making the
Tb proxy a poor choice.....Measuring HR is likely a much better indicator of MR and thus a more
appropriate way to assess changes in MR, especially in the tropics....this might actually get us to
re-think the idea of and terminology “heterothermy”.....perhaps it should be hetero-metabolism.

This is an interesting ms showing that Molossus molossus enters low energy states independent
of ambient temperature, and that heart rate is a robust proxy for metabolic rate. The authors
show clearly that by modifying heart rate and oxygen consumption these bats may save energy
under high ambient temperatures, which is a clearly important strategy in hot climates.
The science of this ms is fine and I have no particular objections. As for its style, I would
appreciate a tighter narrative – the ms is filled with details, overly long and at times a bit hard to
read. Shortening the text and working a bit more on writing style would make this ms a more
pleasant reading and I encourage the authors to do so.

I would also suggest reassuring the reader on how the tagged subjects were protected from
infections. The tagging procedure used here is quite invasive (see pp. 3-4) and stating that the
bats did not lose weight over a few days may sound insufficient. Was a vet present during
tagging operations? Was any antibiotics administered to the tagged bats, as cleaning the part with
70% alcohol might not be enough, all the more in tropical environments where infections are
especially frequent? I think such details should be provided in the material and method section. I
hope the authors will not just reply saying that their methods were approved by the relevant
local bodies listed on p. 16 and provide more details.

O’Mara and colleagues present their findings on a relatively neglected aspect of
thermoregulation, heterothermy in tropical mammals, with their focal species the bat, Molossus
molossus. Although ambient temperatures do not largely fluctuate in the tropics as compared
with temperate climate temperatures, these descriptions of the use of heterothermy in a tropical
species shows evidence of small but regular energy savings that over the long term may be highly
beneficial to the animal by reducing total amount of food intake needed to support
thermoregulation. The authors have prepared a paper that is very nicely written; it flows easily
and is straightforward to follow. The language is formal, but clear and direct. I appreciated the
emphasis on an integrative approach, specifically by using multiple detection methods to capture
a variety of signals from these less pronounced differences in regulating torpor that may be
adaptive. Specifically, heart rate, oxygen consumption/carbon dioxide production, and body
temperature all were measured. This study also integrated measuring aspects of metabolism in
captive bats under controlled environmental conditions, and collected field metabolic rates in
free-ranging bats of the same species, and therefore provide an indication on how the outcome
measures (i.e. metabolic rates, heart rate) vary by circumstance. Overall, I found this manuscript
enjoyable to read and informative on the topic, providing new insight into the seemingly huge
suite of less pronounced variations along a gradient of high vs. low torpor use.

Below are specific comments:
Page 3, Line 41: “to make large energetic reductions possible at high Ta” – have you estimated the
savings quantitatively? For the findings of torpor uses at high ambient temperature to show
important implications, it would be useful to estimate how many joules a bats saves over a period
of time and to equate this to savings in a lowered need to forage for food as well as being able to
devote energy to other important processes (e.g. reproduction).
Page 4, Line 39: Please re-state to clarify whether the thermoneutral zone mentioned is specific to
this species, not simply other neotropical bats.
Page 5, Line 18: Given that the use of torpor is intricately linked with ambient temperature, it is
important to know how well the temperature data collected using monitoring programs
approximates temperatures in the maternity site. Where are the physical locations of the
temperature monitoring equipment in relation to the field site? This is unclear and needs to be
stated. Preferably, temperatures should have been measured inside the site itself. Is there any
site-specific temperature data that can be compared with the monitoring data?
Page 5, Line 54: It would be useful to comment on how the results could differ between the two
methods of analyzing heart rate data in field vs. captive studies. Are there any implications of
this, could you have missed something, over or underestimated rates?
Page 6, Line 14: Please clarify, at least in general, which other mammalian species were selected
for this analysis. Specifically, please convey whether species living in similar neotropical/tropical
habitats were used in this analysis or if both temperate and neotropical/tropical species were
included.

25 1. Summary
26
27
28 Reduction in body temperature to meet ambient temperature is a common strategy for small endotherms to save energy.
29
Daily heterothermy, or torpor, and its metabolic reduction is particularly pronounced in regions with large variation in
30
31 daily ambient temperature, but many subtropical and tropical species also use daily heterothermy on cool days. This is
32
33 particularly pronounced in temperate bat species (Order Chiroptera) , however, it is less clear how tropical bats save
34
35 energy if ambient temperatures remain high. We recorded heart rate and body temperature of free-ranging Pallas’ mastiff
36
37 bats (Molossus molossus) in Gamboa, Panamá, and showed that these individuals use low field metabolic rates across a
38
39 wide range of body temperatures that conform to high ambient temperature. Importantly, low metabolic rates in
40
41 controlled respirometry trials were best predicted by heart rate, and not body temperature. Molossus molossus enter
42
torpor-like states at body temperatures of 32°C, and thermoconform across a range of temperatures. Such flexible
43
44 strategies for energy savings may be far more common in tropical endotherms than currently known.

49

51 Maintaining body temperature (Tb) is energetically costly, particularly when ambient temperatures (Ta) are cold and food
52
resources scarce [1]. This problem would appear to be minimal in the tropics, where Ta is generally high. However, there

can be strong resource ephemerality in tropical systems, making energy conservation a priority [2-4]. As seasonality
1 becomes more intense with climate change [5], understanding individual level physiological mechanisms and energetic
2
3 limitations will be essential to understand population level adaptation [6]. This is particularly true for tropical species,
4
5 which may be limited in their energetic flexibility due to current adaptation to high Ta [7-11].
6
7
8
9 One physiological strategy that has evolved repeatedly to minimize energetic expenditure is the controlled reduction of
10
11 metabolic rate (MR) and (Tb) in cool Ta so that endotherms expend less energy to defend Tb. Often described as daily
12
heterothermy or torpor [1, 12, 13], this phenomenon is widespread among mammals and is typically a response that
13
14 mitigates low food availability and low Ta [13]. It is particularly pronounced in the large and diverse Order of bats
15
16 (Chiroptera), which need effective energy-saving strategies due to their small size, high metabolic requirements, and
17
18 propensity to lose large amounts of heat and water through their large, naked wing membranes [14]. Although most
19
20 common in temperate regions, sub-tropical and tropical species of bats will also enter torpor and many species will show
21
22 heterothermy only when Ta falls below a critical threshold of 24°C [15-17] or at night [18, 19]. However, desert-dwelling
23
24 species and those in hot climates may enter torpor at Ta greater than 30°C [18, 20]. The high Tas at which these bats begin
25
to thermoconform approach the normal homoeothermic body temperature of most mammals (ca. 36-38°C). In much of
26
27 the lowland tropics, Ta remains high throughout the year despite large variation in rainfall and subsequent food
28
29 availability, and this low variation in Ta could make achieving low-energy states a challenge.
30
31
32
33 These small differences in Ta and Tb may mask that tropical mammals are more metabolically labile than we have been
34
35 able to appreciate [21, 22]. The estimates of energetic expenditure that skin or Tb give may not wholly indicate reduced
36
37 metabolic states [1, 7], and it is increasingly apparent that Tb alone is not wholly representative of the energetic
38
expenditure of tropical animals [7, 18, 22-26]. We must then find additional strategies that tropical mammals use to
39
40 minimize energetic expenditure in environments with high Ta, such as the tropics, that may have selected for more diverse
41
42 and flexible strategies that minimize energetic expenditure. One such measure would be variation in heart rate (fH) and
43
44 delivery of oxygen throughout the body. Adjustment of heart rate at high Ta would allow individuals to enter low
45
46 metabolic states at high Tb, thus saving energy while staying alert and avoiding predation. In addition, mostly due to
47
48 methodological restrictions, most work has focused on measuring physiological responses to controlled variation in Ta
49
[16] instead of under natural conditions, which might not reveal the full range of animals' physiological capacity [22, 27-
50
51
29].
52
53
54
55 Heart rate (fH) provides a measure of energy expenditure independent of Tb measures and can help clarify the energetic
56
57 strategies used by animals in areas with low variation in Ta [30-32]. Because fH is proportional to oxygen consumption,
58
59 and therefore MR, the remote measurement of fH through telemetry or logging devices gives detailed insight into

3
1
2 instantaneous individual energy consumption [32-34]. Reduction in fH is one of the first measurable indications of a
3
4 precipitated torpid state, with metabolic rate falling at the same rate as fH and Tb subsequently falling at a slower rate to a
5
6 controlled level [35-37]. This lagging relationship between fH and Tb in torpor provides the opportunity for independence
7
of these two aspects of metabolism that can be exploited by tropical animals at high Ta [36, 38]. Reduced MR and torpor
8
9 at high Tb in hibernating subtropical marsupials, lemurs, and arid-adapted Golden spiny mice and bats [12, 18, 25, 39,
10
11 40], all indicate that fH may be a better predictor of low-energy states than Tb or the difference between Tb – Ta (Tdiff),
12
13 particularly when Tdiff is small, such as in the tropics.
14
15
16
17 Our goal was to test the contribution of fH and Tb to low-energy states in Pallas’ mastiff bats (Molossus molossus). In
18
19 captivity M. molossus modulate their body temperature from ca. 28°C during the day (2°C higher than Ta) to 34-35°C
20
during the night when not allowed to fly [41], but measures of field Tb were still lacking. In our field site in Gamboa,
21
22 Panamá the 10-12 g bats forage in social groups to maximize the probability of locating ephemeral insect swarms in open
23
24 air. They forage 30-40 minutes per night, but return to their roosts 20% heavier [42-44]. In addition to the localization
25
26 challenges of this productive, but short window of food availability inclement weather that can disperse insect clouds and
27
28 prevent animals from flying makes M. molossus susceptible to unpredictable food shortages. Reduction of energetic
29
30 requirements through low energy states may be particularly advantageous in these scenarios. Molossus molossus spend 23
31
32 hours in their roost with heart rates as low as 40-50 bpm and an average of 130 ± 53 bpm during daytime rest and 156 ±
33
71 bpm at night [43]. These resting rates are 50% lower than expected and indicate that the bats may be approaching a
34
35 torpid state even at high Ta, and presumed high Tb, but this remained untested.
36
37
38
39 We hypothesized that M. molossus would thermoconform at high Ta, with similar metabolic rates across a wide range of
40
41 Ta. Subsequently, low fH will be used by M. molossus across a wide range of Tb, allowing M. molossus to make large
42
43 energetic reductions possible at high Ta. We established relationships among fH, Tb, Ta, and energy consumption in
44
captive individuals and then applied these relationships to free-ranging bats roosting in their natural social groups.

50 3. Materials and Methods
51 3.1 Animal capture and marking
52 We captured 11 M. molossus (10.5 ± 0.7 g) with mist nets as they emerged from their roosts in holes and crevices
53
54 underneath houses in Gamboa, Panamá. We marked each bat with a subcutaneous temperature sensitive PIT-tag
55
(BioThermo13, Biomark Inc, Boise ID, USA)[41, 45] and fitted it with an external heart rate transmitter (ca 0.8 g;
56
57 SP2000 HR Sparrow Systems, Fisher, IL USA) that emits a continuous long-wave signal, interrupted by cardiac muscle
58
59 potentials [34, 46]. To attach the heart rate transmitter, we trimmed the fur in the middle of the back below the shoulder

blades, applied a topical analgesic (Xylocaine gel, Astra Zeneca, Wedel Germany), and disinfected the skin with 70%
1 EtOH [43]. We inserted the transmitter’s two disinfected gold electrodes ca. 3 mm dorsally through a puncture made with
2
3 a 23 ga sterile needle. The transmitters were mounted on thin, flexible cloth and then glued over the electrode insertion
4
5 points using a silicone-based skin adhesive (Sauer Hautkleber, Manfred Sauer, Germany). The electrodes were flexible
6
7 and did not appear to disturb the animals. Transmitters represented 7.0 ± 0.7% (SD) of body mass [47]. We removed
8
9 transmitters immediately after respirometry experiments or after 2-3 days of deployment on free-ranging bats. Bats either
10
11 maintained body mass or gained up to 1 g of mass (0.6 ± 0.3 g) revealing no measurable negative impact of the short-term
12
deployment of the additional mass of the transmitter.
13
14
15
16 3.2 Laboratory measurements of heart rate, body temperature and metabolic rate.
17 We used an open-flow, push-through respirometry system [48] to measure rates of oxygen consumption (V<U+0307>O2) carbon
18
19 dioxide production (V<U+0307>CO2), and Tb of six bats for 10 – 20 hours continuously [49]. We dried incurrent air (>75% relative
20
21 humidity, ~26°C) with Drierite (WH Hammond Drierite Co, Ltd, Xenia, OH, USA) and pumped it through a mass flow
22
23 controller (FB8, Sable Systems International, Las Vegas, NV, USA) into a 1.97 L respirometry chamber fitted with a
24
thermocouple within a 20 L insulated cooler that was dark and temperature controlled (PELT5, Sable Systems). An
25
26 additional empty chamber served as a reference (baseline) to the animal chamber. Flow rate was 300 mL min-1 and
27
28 relative humidity and vapor production were measured with a RH-300 (Sable Systems). After drying the excurrent air
29
30 again with Drierite, we measured CO2 concentration (FOXBOX, Sable Systems), and after scrubbing the air of CO2 with
31
32 Ascarite (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro NJ, USA) we determined O2 concentrations (FOXBOX, Sable Systems).
33
34 Chamber temperature, CO2, O2, and relative humidity were recorded at 1 Hz directly with Expedata via the UI-2 data
35
36 acquisition interface (Sable Systems). Bats had the option to roost on vertical or horizontal mesh platforms above a layer
37
of mineral oil used to trap excrement. We kept the bats at 28 and 32°C for at least two hours at a time, which is equal to
38
39 or lower than the lower critical threshold of their thermoneutral zone [50]. We measured bat Tb via PIT tag
40
41 (BioThermo13, Biomark, Inc.) every minute using an antenna (HPR Plus, Biomark) in the insulated chamber [41], and
42
43 we recorded fH as a sound file (see below). PIT tag calibrations against a thermometer traceable to the U.S. National
44
45 Bureau of Standards showed mean measurement error of 0.21 ± 0.2 °C. fH was averaged over the one minute preceding
46
47 each Tb measurement. This gave five Tb and fH measures for each measurement of V<U+0307>O2 and V<U+0307>CO2. We used carbon
48
49 dioxide (V<U+0307>CO2) production to estimate metabolic rates using Equation 10.5 from Lighton [51]: V<U+0307>CO2= (FeCO2-
50
FiCO2)*FR/(1-FeCO2*(1-(1-RER))), where FiCO2 is the incurrent CO2 content, FeCO2 is the excurrent CO2 content, FR
51
52 is the flow rate and RER is the respiratory exchange ratio (V<U+0307>CO2:V<U+0307>O2), which we calculated to be 0.8 from empirical
53
54 measurements of CO2 and O2. We converted V<U+0307>CO2 (mL min-1) to metabolic rates [52, 53] that would be comparable to
55
56 field rates using the standard conversion of 25.0 J mL-1 CO2. After conclusion of the experiment, heart rate transmitters
57
58 were removed, bats were offered water via transfer pipette and placed in the entrance to their roost.

2 3.3 Field heart rate and body temperature telemetry.
3 We recorded fH and Tb of five bats that were not part of the respirometry experiments during 1-3 days and nights in their
4
5 natural roosts. We used telemetry receivers (AR8000, AOR Ltd) connected to 3-element Yagi antennae (Sparrow
6
7 Systems) to detect the signal of the heart rate transmitter. This was then recorded via mini-dv output to a wave file on a
8
digital recorder (Tascam DR-05). Maximum recording distance for Tb was 10 cm, and 100 m for fH transmitters;
9
10 therefore, no flying data were recorded. Three bats (1646, 1721, 1732) roosted in the walls of a wooden house and had
11
12 both fH and Tb sampled every 10 minutes. Heart rate was recorded continuously for the two bats tracked in 2014 (2253,
13
14 2289) and Tb was recorded once per minute. Bat 2253 roosted in the roof of a wooden structure under a metal roof and
15
16 bat 2289 in the brick ground floor of a house. To temporally synchronize Tb and fH, a smoothed fH of the previous 60
17
18 seconds was matched to each Tb. Ambient temperature data were recorded by the Autoridad del Canal de Panamá for
19
Gamboa and provided by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute’s Physical Monitoring Program, sampled in 15
20
21
minute intervals. Daytime mean ambient temperature was 25.87 ± 1.21 °C (mean daytime minimum to mean maximum:
22
23 23.38 – 28.24), and mean nightly ambient temperature was 23.74 ± 0.50 °C (mean nightly minimum to mean maximum:
24
25 22.74 – 24.78 °C). These temperatures do not directly measure the microhabitats the bats experience in their roosts, but
26
27 show the potential Ta that bats experience across the day.
28
29
30
31 3.4 Heart rate scoring
32 To date, heart rate from radio transmitters has been scored visually at sampling intervals of five to ten minutes [33, 34,
33
46, 54]. However, complete sampling has revealed novel energy-saving strategies, where bats briefly depress heart rate
34
35 several times per hour [45], a pattern that would not have been detected using this temporally coarse method. We
36
37 therefore fully sampled the recorded data using an automated approach in R 3.3.2 [55] to identify and count heartbeats
38
39 [45]. We applied a finite impulse response filter in seewave [56] with a window length of 1500 – 2000 samples to select
40
41 the carrier frequency of the transmitter. We counted individual heartbeats by applying a timer function in seewave that ran
42
43 over non-overlapping windows of 500 samples. This created a resolution of 88-96 sampling windows per second. We
44
then applied a kernel density filter in KernSmooth [57] to further eliminate noise that was outside of the 90% quantile.
45
46
This approach is conservative and may have eliminated some heart rate outliers, but the autocorrelated nature of heart rate
47
48 allowed us to filter out errors likely induced by static or other interference in the recordings. Automated samples were
49
50 visually inspected periodically to validate the filtering method, particularly in periods with high variation.
51
52
53
54 We could not apply the full automated methods to the respirometry data due to large amounts of interference from the
55
56 PIT tag reader within the respirometry chamber. Here, we hand-scored heart rate by counting all heart beats within the
57
first 10 seconds of every minute. This was the same time resolution as Tb measures and provided five fH measures per unit
58

of metabolic rate sampling. We then averaged these measures to create a single value for each five-minute respirometry
1 sample.

5 3.5 Analysis
6 We tested the fit of heart rate (fH), body temperature (Tb), and the difference between body temperature and ambient
7
8 temperature (Tdiff = Tb - Ta) on metabolic rate (MR) using generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMM) with
9
10 individual as a random intercept in lme4 after inspecting the data for normality and equal variance. We used both field
11
metabolic rate (FMR, kJ hour-1) and mass-specific metabolic rates (W g-1) to facilitate broader comparisons with
12
13
published data, particularly those collected in field experiments. To contextualize our results we compared the minimum
14
15 metabolic rates of M. molossus, identified as the lowest 10% quantile of the MR for each individual, to minimum torpor
16
17 metabolic rates for species that undergo daily torpor from three speciose mammalian orders (Chiroptera,
18
19 Dasyuromorphia, and Rodentia; data from Ruf and Geiser [13]). A nested model approach revealed that all three of our
20
21 predictors (fH, Tb, Tdiff) contributed significantly to explaining the variation in both measures of energy consumption
22
23 (FMR and mass-specific MR). We therefore took a model selection approach to evaluate which factors were the most
24
efficient at predicting energy consumption in respirometry. We calculated AICc for each model, as well as the confidence
25
26 intervals for each model parameter in lme4, and both the marginal (fixed effects alone) and conditional (full model) R2
27
28 values in MuMIn [58] using the approach outlined by Nakagawa & Schielzeth [59]. All analyses were performed in R
29
30 3.3.2 [55], and we present means ± SD for all variables unless otherwise noted.
31
32
33 4. Results
34 4.1 Respirometry, captive heart rate, body temperature and energy consumption.
35
All bats reduced MR and Tb in the respirometry chamber. We recorded a large range of MR (0.075 – 1.245 kJ hour-1 or
36
37 0.0021 – 0.325 W g-1), fH (59 - 999 bpm), and Tb (27.9 – 37.6°C) across the 10 – 20 hours of continuous sampling. In
38
39 general, Tb followed Ta when MR was reduced (figures 1& electronic supplementary material figure S1), across the small
40
41 range of Ta that we measured and fH was not dependant on Tb. After arousals fH dropped rapidly into a low metabolic
42
43 state, and Tb eventually followed at a slower rate. Bats showed low MR of 0.1218 ± 0.021 (mean ± SD) kJ hour-1
44
45 (0.00314 ± 0.00051W g-1). When we further examined the stable MR at our two Ta, we found that metabolic rates were
46
47 lower at 28 °C (0.131 ± 0.014 SE kJ hour-1) than at 32 °C (0.160 ± 0.001 SE kJ hour-1; <U+07EF>21 = 445.77, p < 0.001; figure 2).
48
These lower MR at 28 °C are supported by lower fH at 28 °C (82.4 ± 6.3 bpm) than at 32 °C (115.8 ± 1.0 bpm; <U+07EF>21 =
49
50 1059.2, p < 0.001; figure 2).

33
34 Molossus molossus generally used low mass-specific MR in the respirometry chamber. Bats showed low minimum MR
35
36 of 0.1138 ± 0.0167 kJ hour-1 (0.00294 ± 0.00034 W g-1) and this did not differ from the minimum metabolic rates for
37
38 other mammalian orders that use daily heterothermy (<U+07EF>23 = 5.525, p = 0.154; figure 3). Molossus molossus enter the same
39

31 Molossus molossus use the same low range of torpor metabolic rate at higher Tb as other mammals that use daily
32 heterothermy.
33
34
All three predictor variables (fH, Tb, Tdiff) explained substantial variation in MR, but fH alone was the best model
35
36 regardless of any temperature interaction (figure 4, electronic supplementary material table S1). All models that included
37
38 fH had low AICc values and high R2. Models including either Tb or Tdiff resulted in higher fits, but the increase in model
39
40 fit provided by adding in a temperature measure came at a high penalty of AICc. The wide range of temperatures at any
41
42 given metabolic rate and between the two temperature regimes illustrates the low predictive ability of both Tb and Tdiff
43
44 (figures 2 & 4). The best-fit model predicted energetic expenditure as DEE (kJ day-1) = 0.00106fH + 0.0527 (R2c = 0.88).
45
46 Ta had minor effects on fH showing a small but significant increase in fH with rising Ta (<U+07EF>21 = 51, p < 0.001; fH = 7.41*Ta -
47
115.67; R2c = 0.22; figure S2; table S2). There was a stronger relationship between Tb and fH (<U+07EF>21 = 398, p < 0.001; fH =
48
49
14.985*Tb – 353.237; R2c = 0.55; table S2).

25
26 Mean heart rates of free-ranging M. molossus in their roosts were generally low across the 24-hour period but ranged
27
28 from 58 – 1068 bpm. fH varied most in the early evening period when bats returned from foraging or were returned to
29
30 their roost after instrumentation (figure 5). Heart rate elevated to over 1000 bpm during those times. Bat mean roosting fH
31
32 were below 200 bpm for all periods of the day and night (147 ± 57 bpm) and remained in stable low-level states (figure

28
29
30 Tb of roosting bats ranged from 25.3 – 37.2°C and varied both within an hour and across the day (figure 6), and Tb
31
increased with daily Ta (<U+07EF>21 = 39.7, p < 0.001; slope = 0.481, R2m = 0.121, R2c = 0.461). fH in the lowest 10% of observed
32
33 values (i.e., lower than 90 bpm) were observed in all hours of the day except 2, 5, 19, and 20 h. These low rates were
34
35 observed at Tb up to 33°C and fH of 100 bpm observed at up to 36°C (figure S3).
36
37
38
39 Our in-roost Tb-measures indicated that M. molossus used heterothermy with minimum Tb occurring from 2 – 4 am
40
41 during the coolest portion of the night. As daily Ta increased during their rest period Tb became less variable, with
42
43 individuals maintaining a constant Tb that was close to Ta. When individual variation was accounted for, Tb did have a
44
mildly predictive relationship with fH (<U+07EF>21 = 652.0, p < 0.001; slope = 10.12 ± 0.37 (SEM); R2m = 0.215, R2c = 0.450;
45
46 figure S3). The difference between Ta and Tb was also predictive of fH (<U+07EF>21 = 44.15, p < 0.001; slope = 6.97 ± 1.05, R2m =
47
48 0.151, R2cl = 0.426) across a range of Tdiff, which also had the best fit in predicting fH (fH ~ Tb AIC = 21720 N = 2210; fH ~
49
50 Tdiff AIC = 2230, N = 224; table S2, figure S3).
51
52
53
54 Tdiff explained 34% of the variation in fH when inter-individual variation was accounted for via random effects in our
55
56 models. This is best illustrated by individual daily variation in these variables (figure 5). In the shown example, the bat
57
roosted between a wooden ceiling and a metal roof approximately 2 m above the ground. We could not measure the

8 5. Discussion
9 We found that Molossus molossus entered low energy states independent of Ta, which results in substantial energy
10
11 savings across much of their experienced Ta. In respirometry chambers, fH was the best predictor of metabolic rate. These
12
13 results extended to free-ranging M. molossus that used low fH across nearly the full range of Tb measured. Minimizing
14
energy expenditure in tropical settings with low variation in high Ta may then be possible through modifications of heart
15
16 rate and oxygen consumption that may be independent of Tb. Such physiological adaptations are perhaps vital for tropical
17
18 lowland endotherms because they free them from some of the energetic constraints of high Ta, but these effects remain
19
20 understudied like many aspect of tropical ecosystems [60].
21
22
23
24 It is hypothesized that as Ta rises, so must MR, and that as global temperatures rise tropical species will be faced with
25
26 large thermal challenges [4, 10]. A range of mammals achieves low metabolic rates at relatively high Tb, described as
27
potential “hyperthermic daily torpor” by Lovegrove et al [9]. For example, gerbils (32-35°C) [40], fat-tailed dwarf lemurs
28
29 (30°C) [25], and some desert dwelling bats (31-33°C, [18, 19]), Tb thermoconforms to high Ta while animals remain in
30
31 low metabolic states and MR then increases with rising Ta. Bats appear to be particularly flexible in their thermal profiles.
32
33 Some mammal species are even able to thermoconform to Ta > 45°C for extended periods of time, which would be lethal
34
35 in many other mammals [19, 61]. This may be related to the high Tb generated during flight [14], or to the high TNZ
36
37 upper critical temperature (e.g., 38°C) found in many species [50], although the thermoneutral dynamics for most bat
38
39 species are underexplored. In previous work on tropical and subtropical bats, reduction of Tb via heterothermy is variable,
40
and they only show heterothermy when Ta is below 20-25°C [29, 62-65]. However, many of these species, particularly
41
42 those in free-ranging field conditions, have only had Tb measured. It is possible that, like M. molossus, they enter low
43
44 energy states at relatively high Tb and maintain low heart rates across a wide range of Ta and Tb. Entering a low energy
45
46 state at high Tb, or a Tb within the thermoneutral zone, would allow animals to lower their FMR without the costs of re-
47
48 warming that are incurred as they leave torpid states [66], while taking advantage of a the benefits of heterothermy with
49
50 minimal costs [7, 9]. Passive warming would be particularly advantageous for nocturnal animals that enter their active
51
52 periods as Ta lowers and is less likely to provide much passive thermal support in their transition toward active states.
53
54
55 Our respirometry measures did not capture the full metabolic potential of M. molossus observed in the wild roosts. The Ta
56
57 that we used in our respirometry measures did not extend far beyond the lower critical temperature (ca. 30 °C) of the
58
59 thermoneutral zone reported for M. molossus [50], but energy consumption at these temperatures was far lower than
60

BMR reported for this species, and steady state MR were lower at 28 °C than at 32 °C, with a mean difference of 0.029 kJ
1 hour-1. The mean of the 30% quantile of respirometry MR (0.00314 ± 0.0005 W g-1), was only 39% of the previously
2
3 measured BMR for M. molossus (0.008044 W g-1 [50]. We did not observe this value until the 90% quantile of our data,
4
5 placing it among the highest MRs we recorded for our bats. The high temporal variability in metabolic rate indicates that
6
7 we did not find a stable BMR in our respirometry measurements, despite extended measurement periods and Ta that
8
9 should be within a neutral range for this species. Accurately measuring BMR and thermoneutral zone is difficult when
10
11 species thermoconform across a wide range of Ta [7, 67] and our data show that this type of energetic and thermal
12
flexibility may be common in tropical bats.
13
14
15
16 Regardless of torpid or resting states, fH is an accurate measure of metabolic rate during steady state conditions and when
17
18 transitioning between resting states. However, torpor with strong heterothermy is not just an extrapolation of a resting
19
20 state as regressions of torpid bats would underestimate resting V<U+0307>O2 by up to 75% [68]. The low metabolic states in M.
21
22 molossus do not show such a curvilinear relationship, with linear models providing the best fit to our respirometry data.
23
24 The differences in both the shape and extent of the calibration curve and low metabolic rates in M. molossus emphasize
25
the distinct metabolic differences between animals that hibernate and those that use only daily torpor [13] and the
26
27 importance to parameterize individual physiological states for each species. We are careful not to infer a continuous
28
29 linear relationship once animals are exercising because this likely underestimates metabolic rate during exercise [30].
30
31 Through careful calibration and the use of non-linear exponential estimates of energy consumption from fH based on body
32
33 mass and heart mass, it may be possible to even more accurately estimate the energetic expenditure of exercising free-
34
35 ranging animals.
36
37
38
The regular low metabolic states used by M. molossus in both respirometry and natural roosts may be an overall energetic
39
40 conservation strategy to compensate for their ephemeral food resources. These small bats typically forage over water
41
42 bodies for less than an hour per night on unpredictable, but rich patches of insects at dusk and dawn [42]. When nights are
43
44 particularly windy or rainy these bats tend to forgo foraging (Dechmann, unpublished data) and there is a positive
45
46 relationship between the duration of foraging and fH in the roost [43]. Furthermore, we observed Tb reductions consistent
47
48 with heterothermy across a wide range of Ta, with free-ranging bats using Tb of 25.3 – 37.2 °C. Multiday torpor bouts
49
have not been observed in M. molossus and we did not attempt to measure this in our experiment. While M. molossus are
50
51
capable of maintaining stable blood glucose levels for up to 48 hours of fasting [69], total reduction of MR through
52
53 extended torpor-like states may allow them to cope with multiple nights of inclement weather. In some cases, Tb was
54
55 lower than the Ta recorded at the Panama Canal (figure S2). This highlights that these bats select cool, stable roost
56
57 microhabitats regardless of their ability to maintain low MR at high Tb. The use of torpor by a wide diversity of tropical
58
59 and sub-tropical mammals [13, 16, 22, 25, 70, 71] illustrates the utility of reductions in metabolic rates and Tb during

1
2 periods of low food availability. However, starvation risk is not the only driver of torpor, as well-fed bats will also use
3
4 torpor to minimize time outside the roost [17]. These torpor and torpor-like states at high Tb may be particularly
5
6 important to reduce the evaporative water loss incurred by bats via the large naked membrane of their wings [14], which
7
can be reduced by 90% during torpid states [72, 73]. The possibility of low energy states at relatively high Tb allows M.
8
9 molossus to remain active and alert and move away from observers. This means that unlike the lethargic torpid bats from
10
11 the temperate zones, these bats can escape from predators at any given time. Daily torpor-like states in M. molossus allow
12
13 them to minimize exposure to risks outside of their roost (such as predators and water loss), while maximizing their
14
15 foraging returns.

22 6. Conclusion
23 We suggest that the low-energy state that we measure in M. molossus is torpor with shallow heterothermy. In other small
24
25 mammals minimum fH during daily torpor at low Tb is near 70 bpm [36, 37, 74-76]. This is similar to the minimum stable
26
27 rates (58 – 75 bpm) of M. molossus both during respirometry and in their natural roosts, but much higher than the fH of 8
28
bpm for hibernating bats [68]. The metabolic rates used by our bats are well within the ranges reported for other
29
30 mammalian orders that use daily heterothermy (figure 3), but occur at higher Tb. Bats originated in the tropics and what
31
32 we find in M. molossus is likely an example of the basal form of heterothermy that evolved near the root of the
33
34 mammalian radiation [77]. The ability to lower Tb to take advantage of extreme energy savings in deep torpor or
35
36 hibernation would then have been built upon this set of regulatory networks driven by cellular requirements for oxygen
37
38 diffusion via fH, which reduced total metabolic rates while in thermoneutral conditions or above. Tropical heterothermy or
39
40 torpor may allow individuals to flexibly adjust energetic expenditure to rapid environmental changes at fine time scales,
41
as well as minimize energetic expenditure during pregnancy and lactation when Tb reductions may be constrained [7, 17,
42
43 65, 78].
44
45
46
47 Low fH in response to lowered oxygen demands is an effective, flexible strategy when animals do not need to defend Tb
48
49 or can take advantage of a potentially broad thermoneutral zone. Daily torpor and hibernation at high Tb highlight
50
51 energetic flexibility needed to cope with fluctuating environments in the tropics and subtropics. Work integrating
52
53 energetic expenditure via fH in birds repeatedly shows lower energetic expenditures than would be predicted [33, 34, 46,
54
79, 80], indicating that a diversity of adaptations may be possible by manipulating one of the primary drivers of energy
55
56 delivery to metabolism. The widespread nature of heterothermy or torpor-like states in tropical species leads to challenges
57
58 when using traditional cut-off Tb or frequency distributions of Tb. Heart rate from tropical bats, including this study, has
59
60 shown surprising metabolic strategies to cope with life in warm ambient temperatures [21, 45]. This direct information on

8 Figure 1. Metabolic rate (black line), fH (red circles), Tb (blue triangles), and Ta (dotted line) of an exemplary M. molossus
9 measured across 20 hours in open-flow respirometry
10
11 Figure 2. Metabolic rate (kJ hour-1) and heart rate (bpm) of bats during steady state minimum measures at Ta of 28 and 32
12 °C during respirometry experiments. Violin plots show the distribution and density of heart rate (top) and metabolic rate
13 (right) at each temperature. Note that all heart rates remained below 150 bpm.
14
15 Figure 3. Minimum torpor metabolic rates (TMR) and minimum Tb for Chiroptera, Dasyuromorphia, and Rodentia that
16 use daily heterothermy (from Ruf & Geiser 2015), and the mean 10% quantile values (± sd) for individual M. molossus.
17 Molossus molossus use the same low range of torpor metabolic rate at higher Tb as other mammals that use daily
18 heterothermy.
19
Figure 4. The relationship between M. molossus metabolic rate (kJ hour-1) and fH, Tb, and Tdiff. In all models evaluated fH
20
has the best predictive fit for energy consumption (table S1).
21
22 Figure 5. In-roost fH (open circles), Tb (blue line), and Ta (red diamonds) measured for bat 2289 across a 36-hour period.
23 The asterisk (*) indicates where the bat was released back to its roost. Missing fH and Tb data coincide with the bat’s
24 foraging period and equipment adjustment. Scotophase is indicated by the filled bar along the bottom.
25
26 Figure 6. Hourly means of fH (top) and Tb (bottom) simultaneously measured from bats in their natural roosts. Scotophase
27 is indicated by the filled bar along the bottom of each panel.
28
29 Supplementary figure and table legends
30 Figure S1. Metabolic rate (kJ hour-1: black line), heart rate (fH: red circles), body temperature (Tb: blue triangles) and
ambient temperature (Ta: blue dotted line) of individual M. molossus measured in open-flow respirometry.
31
32 Figure S2. The relationship between M. molossus fH and Tb, Ta, and Tdiff. All temperature measures were weakly
33 predictive of heart rate when accounting for inter-individual variability.
34
35 Figure S3. In-roost measurements of fH and Tb (top) and Tdiff (bottom) weakly predict heart rate of M. molossus in their
36 natural roosts (R2c = 0.226 and 0.336, respectively).
37
38 Figure S3. In-roost measurements of fH and Tb (top) and Tdiff (bottom) weakly predict heart rate of M. molossus in their
39 natural roosts (R2c = 0.226 and 0.336, respectively).
40
41 Table S1. GLMM model selection to estimate energy consumption via heart rate (fH), body temperature (Tb) or the
42 difference between Tb and Ta (Tdiff) in M. molossus. Shown are the corrected AIC value (AICc), and the model R2 for
43 fixed factors only (R2m) and conditional R2 with random effects included (R2c).

Appendix B
Thank you for the opportunity to provide minor revisions to RSOS 2017-171359. We are especially
happy with the enthusiasm for the work from the reviewers and their helpful suggestions. Both
Reviewer 1 & 2 noted that the text is a bit long and detailed (although Reviewer 3 found this
agreeable). We have gone through and smoothed out the language and attempted to tighten the
narrative.
We also want to particularly thank the reviewers for their positive and constructive comments. They
are all phrased in clear, constructive, and direct terms that we have addressed below.
Reviewer 1 had the most extensive critique in the attached pdf, both on detail and on delivery. While
critical, Reviewer 1 also highlighted where s/he agreed with us and on where s/he found novelty in our
work. These comments were really appreciated. In particular Reviewer 1 asked for a re-orientation of
phrasing to show that Tb is a consequence of MR. This is absolutely true and we have made these
subtle and important changes throughout. Because of the extensive small changes that Reviewer 1
highlights, we will not respond to each one individually – we agree with them all and have rephrased
and corrected the statements indicated. Reviewer 1 questions the necessity of including Figure 3
where we show comparative data across several Orders of mammals. While these data were not
collected across the same conditions, they come from a fundamental review on torpor and hibernation
biology. We think that this is important to reinforce the scale of the metabolic rate reductions we
observe, especially to reach a wider audience of non-specialists. We also really like the term hetero-
metabolism proposed by Reviewer 1, but we need to find another term since this already is used to
describe one variation of insect metamorphosis (e.g., Orthoptera). We’re hopeful that as physiological
strategies of tropical animals are investigated in closer detail, the field will converge on a re-definition
of the metabolic flexibility of vertebrates.
Reviewer: 1
Overall, this is a very good piece of work. The technique used is going to become standard in my
view relatively rapidly. The writing is generally good although I think at times the authors try to write a
bit “impressively” rather than strive for simplicity and clarity. I have put a large number of comments,
both conceptual and editorial, directly on the MS. I really have only one substantive comment that I
think needs to be addressed and it concerns the rationale/context/set up for the study.
In my view the rationale for the study is a bit out of step. I concur completely that measuring heart
rate is a really cool thing to do but not for the reasons you set out. A decline in Tb has long been
used as a proxy to assess entry into torpor (or heterothermy). But it is not a drop in Tb per se that
saves energy it is the controlled reduction in metabolic rate (MR). In the tropics where Ta is mostly
high, it is really hard to differentiate between the potentially small changes in Tb that occur with torpor
or the small Tb-Ta differentials. It is just not possible for animals to get colder than Ta...but they may
still derive considerable energy savings from dropping MR – making the Tb proxy a poor
choice.....Measuring HR is likely a much better indicator of MR and thus a more appropriate way to
assess changes in MR, especially in the tropics....this might actually get us to re-think the idea of and
terminology “heterothermy”.....perhaps it should be hetero-metabolism.
Reviewer: 2
This is an interesting ms showing that Molossus molossus enters low energy states independent of
ambient temperature, and that heart rate is a robust proxy for metabolic rate. The authors show
clearly that by modifying heart rate and oxygen consumption these bats may save energy under
high ambient temperatures, which is a clearly important strategy in hot climates.
The science of this ms is fine and I have no particular objections. As for its style, I would appreciate a
tighter narrative – the ms is filled with details, overly long and at times a bit hard to read. Shortening
the text and working a bit more on writing style would make this ms a more pleasant reading and I
encourage the authors to do so.
I would also suggest reassuring the reader on how the tagged subjects were protected from
infections. The tagging procedure used here is quite invasive (see pp. 3-4) and stating that the bats
did not lose weight over a few days may sound insufficient. Was a vet present during tagging
operations? Was any antibiotics administered to the tagged bats, as cleaning the part with 70%
alcohol might not be enough, all the more in tropical environments where infections are especially
frequent? I think such details should be provided in the material and method section. I hope the
authors will not just reply saying that their methods were approved by the relevant local bodies listed
on p. 16 and provide more details. We did not administer any antibiotics since these may have larger
unintended consequences. We have included some text that we find no signs of infection when
devices are removed. Since we measure both Tb and fH we can use this information as a proxy for
metabolic activation of the immune response
Reviewer: 3
O’Mara and colleagues present their findings on a relatively neglected aspect of thermoregulation,
heterothermy in tropical mammals, with their focal species the bat, Molossus molossus. Although
ambient temperatures do not largely fluctuate in the tropics as compared with temperate climate
temperatures, these descriptions of the use of heterothermy in a tropical species shows evidence of
small but regular energy savings that over the long term may be highly beneficial to the animal by
reducing total amount of food intake needed to support thermoregulation. The authors have prepared
a paper that is very nicely written; it flows easily and is straightforward to follow. The language is
formal, but clear and direct. I appreciated the emphasis on an integrative approach, specifically by
using multiple detection methods to capture a variety of signals from these less pronounced
differences in regulating torpor that may be adaptive. Specifically, heart rate, oxygen
consumption/carbon dioxide production, and body temperature all were measured. This study also
integrated measuring aspects of metabolism in captive bats under controlled environmental
conditions, and collected field metabolic rates in free-ranging bats of the same species, and therefore
provide an indication on how the outcome measures (i.e. metabolic rates, heart rate) vary by
circumstance. Overall, I found this manuscript enjoyable to read and informative on the topic,
providing new insight into the seemingly huge suite of less pronounced variations along a gradient of
high vs. low torpor use.
Below are specific comments:
Page 3, Line 41: “to make large energetic reductions possible at high Ta” – have you estimated the
savings quantitatively? For the findings of torpor uses at high ambient temperature to show important
implications, it would be useful to estimate how many joules a bats saves over a period of time and to
equate this to savings in a lowered need to forage for food as well as being able to devote energy to
other important processes (e.g. reproduction). We have rephrased this statement as we were unable
to measure non-torpor resting metabolic rates directly in respirometry.
Page 4, Line 39: Please re-state to clarify whether the thermoneutral zone mentioned is specific to
this species, not simply other neotropical bats. – Clarified.
Page 5, Line 18: Given that the use of torpor is intricately linked with ambient temperature, it is
important to know how well the temperature data collected using monitoring programs approximates
temperatures in the maternity site. Where are the physical locations of the temperature monitoring
equipment in relation to the field site? This is unclear and needs to be stated. Preferably,
temperatures should have been measured inside the site itself. Is there any site-specific temperature
data that can be compared with the monitoring data? –This has been clarified. It would have been
ideal to measure temperatures in the roosts themselves, but the areas in which the bats stay are
highly inaccessible (they roost opening may be several meters away from the roosting spot).
Page 5, Line 54: It would be useful to comment on how the results could differ between the two
methods of analyzing heart rate data in field vs. captive studies. Are there any implications of this,
could you have missed something, over or underestimated rates? – This is an excellent point and we
have added a sentence to this effect, based both on other work in a tent-making bat (O’Mara et al
2017) and the fully-sampled heart rate of the field collected data.
Page 6, Line 14: Please clarify, at least in general, which other mammalian species were selected for
this analysis. Specifically, please convey whether species living in similar neotropical/tropical habitats
were used in this analysis or if both temperate and neotropical/tropical species were included. –
Clarified.
Page 14, Line 9: Please quantify the “substantial energy savings” to support this statement. –As the
introductory sentence of the discussion we prefer to keep this statement general to then be supported
by the subsequent sections.
