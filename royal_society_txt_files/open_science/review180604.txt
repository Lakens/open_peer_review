The work described in this manuscript is original and interesting. The data from the described co-
culture experiments are convincing.
As the authors state in their manuscript, the interzone is a transient tissue with secreted factors
being expressed for limited periods during joint development. However the authors have not
mentioned how the stages of embryos used for co-culture studies with skeletal elements from
different species were selected. Is limb development equivalent across these species at the stages
chosen? I think that it is important to explain this, as the use of developmental stages that are not
equivalent in terms of hindlimb development could also produce what appear to be species
differences in susceptibility to factors secreted by the interzone.
I also have a few other comments:
I think it would aid readability if one of the figures (perhaps Fig. 1) included a panel with a
diagram of the anatomy of a perforated avian and non-perforated non-avian acetabulum, so that
readers less familiar with the anatomy have a better idea of what they are looking at in later
figures.
The NR stages for gecko development referred to in this manuscript are not used in the reference
supplied (reference 11, p2 line 1-2), which instead uses days post-oviposition (dpo) to describe
stages. For ease of reading, can the authors please clarify whether the NR stages used in this
manuscript are equivalent to dpo?
The data clearly demonstrate a difference in susceptibility to factors secreted by the interzone
between avian and non-avian pelves. However the authors reported some variability in the
capability of non-avian femoral anlagen to promote perforation in the chicken and ostrich pelvis.
Could this be related to variability in the stages of the femoral anlagen used in co-culture
experiments (e.g. gecko NR17-22?), and hence differences in the expression of secreted factors
from the interzone? Have the authors looked at how expression of noggin/chordin/Wnt ligands
differs in the hip joint interzone across these stages in the species used in this study?

The revisions that the authors have made to this manuscript have clarified several points that
were previously unclear, and have adequately addressed all the comments raised in my previous
review. The justification for the stages of embryos used for these experiments is now clear; the
use of a wide range of turtle and gecko stages shows that it is highly unlikely that the observed
differences in susceptibility of the pelvis to contact with the interzone are due to any discrepancy
in the stages of embryo used for comparison, or simply to heterochrony in factors which make
the pelvic anlagen susceptible to factors secreted by the interzone.
I have one very minor point regarding pg. 1 line 25 which the authors may want to clarify prior to
publication, but does not necessitate further review. The following sentence is a little unclear:
"Similar to birds, the latter may have been covered by a membrane." By "the latter", are the
authors referring to the dinosaur acetabulum? If so, perhaps the authors could state this rather
than "latter" just for ease of reading.

This is a very interesting and original study that I believe will be important in the literature. For
this reason it is important to have it published in the best condition possible. In order to do this,

the manuscript needs to be read and edited by a scientist who is a native speaker of English.
There are many grammatical errors that are easy to correct; a few of these have been identified by
reviewers. (I regret that English is such a difficult and irregular language!) For this reason I am
logging a "revise" decision to give the authors time to have the manuscript edited. The AE and

Appendix A
Egawa et al., 2018
Morphogenetic mechanism for the acquisition of dinosaur-type
acetabulum
The authors propose that susceptibility of the pelvis against Wnt
ligands was increased in the dinosarur lineage which lead to the
perforation in the hip joint. The research is very unique and would
attract a wide range of interest. The comments are as follows.
Page 2, line 43; ‘Considerable efforts, based on fossil record analysis and comparative
anatomy, have been dedicated to the characterisation of this morphological transition
and its functional significance.’
The references would be needed.
Page4, line 37; ‘When the chicken pelvis touched the proximal end of the quail tibia,
humerus, or the distal end of the femur, cartilage loss was induced at the contact point
(n = 3/5, 2/5, and 2/3, respectively) (figure 4a–c), although the bird shoulder and knee
joint are not perforated.’
I donot understand why “shoulder joint” and “knee joint” appear in
this sentence.
Page 4, line 45; ‘femoral anlagen is unnecessary and the interzone is the secretory
tissue involved in acetabular perforation.’
Is it possible to observe the development of the pelvis after removing
the interzone to confirm the inhibition of perforation? And can you
transplant only the interzone into the pelvis to observe ectopic
perforation?
Page 5, line 5: ‘Regarding the Wnt signal, 100% Wnt9a cell aggregates did not cause
cartilage loss in the pelvic anlagen in gecko (n =0/3) and turtle (n = 0/2), in contrast
to chicken (n = 5/8) (figure 7e,i,m).’
I think that turtle data is the most important data in this paper,
because if cartilage loss is observed in the turtle pelvis, there would
be no difference against Wnt sensitivity between the non-dinasaur
archosauria (turtle) pelvis and the dinosaur (avians) pelvis, although
state of perforation is different between the two lineages. Why is the
sample number of turtles only two? Shouldn’t you increase the
number?
Page 5, line 8; ‘Since 100% Wnt9a cell aggregates did not cause cartilage loss in the
chicken pectoral girdle anlagen (n =0/5) (figure 7n), Wnt ligand susceptibility might be
specific to the pelvic anlagen in chicken.’ And Fig. 7n
Cartilage is partially lost in the scapula (Fig. 7n). What is it?
Page 5, line 27; ‘One basal dinosauromorph, Marasuchus [39], reportedly possessed
partially-perforated acetabulum, but that may not have reflected its original state [10,
33]. Hence, this state could be relevant to all non-dinosaur archosauromorphs.’
I cannot understand this sentence. What is “its original state”. Does
this mean that perforation was caused secondarily during the
fossilization? And “this state” is which state? Do you want to say that
in all non-dinosaur archosauromorphs, there is not perforation in the
pelvis?
Page 5, line 37; ‘Several mechanisms may be proposed for the acquisition of Wnt ligand
susceptibility by the avian pelvic anlagen. E.g., heterochrony is supported by the report
that the hindlimb develops earlier in birds than in “reptiles” (albeit, only relative to the
forelimb) [46]. The degree of cartilaginous differentiation of the pelvis might result in
different Wnt ligand susceptibility.’
Even if the avian hindlimb develops earlier than that in “reptiles”, this
does not always mean the avian humerus (including interzone)
develops earlier than the avian pelvis, or the avian pelvis develops
earlier than the avian humerus. If the pelvis and the humerus develop
as a single unit as the hindlimb, interaction between the pelvis and the
humerus would not change, if the development of the hindlimb became
earlier than that of the ancestral animals.
Page 5, line 39; ‘Heterotopy might be another mechanism. It is supported by our
observation that the chicken pelvis develops at a relatively dorsal position, while the
gecko and turtle pelves develop at relatively ventral positions (data not shown), leading
to the difference in the distance between the pelvic anlagen (thus, the acetabular region)
and the signalling embryonic tissues, e.g., the cloaca [47], and this might result in
different Wnt ligand susceptibility.’
If this hypothesis is correct, how should we understand the result
shown in Fig.2 (the experiment showed that the perforation is made
independent of not only the axial structures but also the cloaca,
namely cell-autonomous development of the hindlimb skeletons)? And
based on this presupposition, the following experiments appear to be
constructed. Thus, the discussion about the heterotopy seems to harm
the value of this paper.
Page 5, line 42; ‘In an even simpler mechanism, Wnt ligand susceptibility might be
underpinned by an avian-specific highly conserved genomic element [48], which would
modulate certain Wnt signalling component(s) in the pelvic anlagen.’
I donot know the “avian-specific highly conserved genomic element”,
then I cannot understand its relevance to the Wnt activity.
Page 5, line 46; ‘Another challenging issue that should be addressed concerns
establishing whether the mechanism of avian acetabular perforation can be applied to
the majority of basal dinosaurs, whose acetabula are perforated but the femoral head
shape must be mismatched [1, 49-51]. This requires auxiliary hypotheses, e.g., the one
proposed by Charig [1], and a sophisticated methodology for scientific inference of the
morphogenesis in extinct organisms [Egawa, in prep].’
I cannot understand this sentence completely.

Appendix B
To editor
We have included the Ethics statement in the revised manuscript on page
6, line 288 as shown below.
All animal experiments were properly performed in accordance with
guidelines provided by Tohoku University.
To Reviewer 1
RE1-1:
As the authors state in their manuscript, the interzone is a transient tissue with
secreted factors being expressed for limited periods during joint development.
However the authors have not mentioned how the stages of embryos used for
co-culture studies with skeletal elements from different species were selected.
Is limb development equivalent across these species at the stages chosen? I
think that it is important to explain this, as the use of developmental stages that
are not equivalent in terms of hindlimb development could also produce what
appear to be species differences in susceptibility to factors secreted by the
interzone.
AU1-1: We agree with the reviewer that the correspondence of stages is
important among skeletal elements of several species. At least, we should
clarify that of pelvic anlagen because we discussed the differences in their
susceptibility. However, it is difficult to clarify such correspondence
among distantly-related species. We used pelvic anlagen from a wide
range of stages of turtles and geckos (on which we could not make a hole
at the contacting point of femur) to unmistakably include the
corresponding stage with avian pelvis (on which we could make a hole at
the contacting point of femur).
We have added the following sentences to clarify the abovementioned
points in the manuscript. p4 line 163:
Since it is difficult to clarify stage correspondence among distantly related
species, we used pelves from wide range of stages of “reptiles” (from the
stage before pelvic development (TK11, NR6) to the stage of mature
cartilage (TK19, NR24)) from both turtle and gecko to correspond to those
of birds.
RE1-2: I think it would aid readability if one of the figures (perhaps Fig. 1)
included a panel with a diagram of the anatomy of a perforated avian and non-
perforated non-avian acetabulum, so that readers less familiar with the anatomy
have a better idea of what they are looking at in later figures.
AU1-2: We appreciate the advice. We added the diagrams of perforated
and non-perorated acetabulum. Incidentally, we revised the alphabets of
each panels in figure 1 and its legend and added the references.
RE1-3: The NR stages for gecko development referred to in this manuscript are
not used in the reference supplied (reference 11, p2 line 1-2), which instead
uses days post-oviposition (dpo) to describe stages. For ease of reading, can the
authors please clarify whether the NR stages used in this manuscript are
equivalent to dpo?
AU1-3: We appreciate the reviewer for pointing this out. We have
clarified this in the revised manuscript.
p2 line 52:
NR stage, which is equivalent to dpo in [11]
RE1-4: The data clearly demonstrate a difference in susceptibility to factors
secreted by the interzone between avian and non-avian pelves. However the
authors reported some variability in the capability of non-avian femoral anlagen
to promote perforation in the chicken and ostrich pelvis. Could this be related
to variability in the stages of the femoral anlagen used in co-culture
experiments (e.g. gecko NR17-22?), and hence differences in the expression of
secreted factors from the interzone? Have the authors looked at how expression
of noggin/chordin/Wnt ligands differs in the hip joint interzone across these
stages in the species used in this study?
AU1-4: We would like to emphasize what we reported and discussed. In
the co-culture experiments with non-avian (= turtle and gecko) femoral
anlagen, we combined only with chicken pelves, but not with ostrich one.
We are afraid that we did not analyse the differences in the expression of
noggin/chordin/Wnt ligands in these species at the various stages, which
exactly can cause variability in the capability of femoral anlagen to
promote perforation in the chicken pelves. To be sure, we reported that
there is variability in the capability of femoral anlagen to promote
perforation in the chicken pelves, 2/3 with quail’s femora, 3/3 with
ostrich’s, 4/8 with turtle’s and 8/14 with gecko’s.
However, because we think this variability in the capability of femoral
anlagen to promote perforation in the chicken pelves cannot significantly
affect our hypothesis and conclusion, at least relative to the variability of
pelvic susceptibility, we did not discuss the former.
Incidentally, we reported that the chordin expression is lower in turtle and
gecko than in chicken (fig 5 d,i,n) in in situ hybridization experiments.
This difference may account for the capability of femoral anlagen to
promote perforation in the chicken pelves as mentioned above, but we
would like to exclude this from the manuscript because we think that it
cannot significantly affect our hypothesis and conclusion.
However, for clarification, we added the following sentences;
P4 line166:
These observations suggested that while femoral anlagen and hip
interzone of all sauropsids have the ability to induce cartilage loss on
avian pelves, the susceptibility of pelvic anlagen is higher in birds than in
“reptiles.”
P4 line174:
These observations suggested that the ability to induce cartilage loss on
avian pelves is not specific to hip joint components (the femoral anlagen
or the hip interzone) and that the high susceptibility of birds is specific to
pelvis among girdles. Taken together, the avian pelvis was highly
susceptible to some factor(s), which led to acetabular perforation.
To Reviewer 2
RE2-1: Page 2, line 43; ‘Considerable efforts, based on fossil record analysis
and comparative anatomy, have been dedicated to the characterisation of this
morphological transition and its functional significance.’
The references would be needed.
AU2-1: Thank you very much for pointing this out; we agree with you and
have inserted the relevant references [1,3].
RE2-2: Page4, line 37; ‘When the chicken pelvis touched the proximal end of
the quail tibia, humerus, or the distal end of the femur, cartilage loss was
induced at the contact point (n = 3/5, 2/5, and 2/3, respectively) (figure 4a–c),
although the bird shoulder and knee joint are not perforated.’
I donot understand why “shoulder joint” and “knee joint” appear in this
sentence.
AU2-2: The reason why we mention shoulder and knee joints here is that
the proximal end of the humerus is a component of the former and the
proximal end of the tibia and the distal end of the femur are components of
the latter. For further clarification, we have provided additional
information as enclosed in the brackets.
P4 line169; the distal end of the quail femur, the proximal end of the quail tibia
(knee joint components)
P4 line170; the proximal end of the quail humerus (shoulder joint component)
Additionally, to clarify the purpose of the experiments, we also added the
following sentence:
P4 line174
These observations suggested that the ability to induce cartilage loss on
avian pelves is not specific to hip joint components (the femoral anlagen
or the hip interzone) and that the high susceptibility of birds is specific to
pelvis among girdles.
In addition, we add an experimental number and changed the order of the
experiments (femur, tibia, humerus) to correspond to the order in figure 4.
RE2-3: Page 4, line 45; ‘femoral anlagen is unnecessary and the interzone is
the secretory tissue involved in acetabular perforation.’
Is it possible to observe the development of the pelvis after removing the
interzone to confirm the inhibition of perforation? And can you transplant only
the interzone into the pelvis to observe ectopic perforation?
AU2-3: We agree that the two experiments mentioned above will
significantly test our hypothesis, but we are afraid we did not perform
them because we failed to remove and isolate the interzone.
RE2-4: Page 5, line 5: ‘Regarding the Wnt signal, 100% Wnt9a cell
aggregates did not cause cartilage loss in the pelvic anlagen in gecko (n =0/3)
and turtle (n = 0/2), in contrast to chicken (n = 5/8) (figure 7e,i,m).’
I think that turtle data is the most important data in this paper, because if
cartilage loss is observed in the turtle pelvis, there would be no difference
against Wnt sensitivity between the non-dinasaur archosauria (turtle) pelvis and
the dinosaur (avians) pelvis, although state of perforation is different between
the two lineages. Why is the sample number of turtles only two? Shouldn’t you
increase the number?
AU2-4: you for pointing this out. As suggested, we repeated the
experiment and revised the sample number and stages as follows:
P5 line 209: n = 0/2 -> n = 0/8
P3 line114: TK17-18 -> TK15-18
Again, to confirm that this difference of susceptibility to Wnt between
turtle and chicken is not due to the developmental stage at which the
pelvic anlagen was obtained, we used the pelvic anlagen of a younger
turtle and added the following sentence to reflect this.
P5 line209:
Since it is difficult to clarify stage correspondence among distantly related
species, we used pelves from wide range of stages of turtle (from the stage
before pelvic development (TK15) to the stage of mature cartilage (TK18))
to correspond to those of chicken.
RE2-5: Page 5, line 8; ‘Since 100% Wnt9a cell aggregates did not cause
cartilage loss in the chicken pectoral girdle anlagen (n =0/5) (figure 7n), Wnt
ligand susceptibility might be specific to the pelvic anlagen in chicken.’ And
Fig. 7n
Cartilage is partially lost in the scapula (Fig. 7n). What is it?
AU2-5: We think this cartilage loss at the area far from pin to anchor cell
aggregate (on the coracoid) is the ossification center. To clarify this, we
included an arrow in figure 7 and explained it in the legend as follows:
P8 line620 : Arrow, ossification centre.
RE2-6: Page 5, line 27; ‘One basal dinosauromorph, Marasuchus [39],
reportedly possessed partially-perforated acetabulum, but that may not have
reflected its original state [10, 33]. Hence, this state could be relevant to all
non-dinosaur archosauromorphs.’
I cannot understand this sentence. What is “its original state”. Does this mean
that perforation was caused secondarily during the fossilization? And “this
state” is which state? Do you want to say that in all non-dinosaur
archosauromorphs, there is not perforation in the pelvis?
AU2-6: Thank you very much for the supplementary explanation. Your
interpretation correctly matches what we mean. To clarify our meaning,
we revised these sentences as follows:
P5 line235:
Although one basal dinosauromorph, Marasuchus [39], reportedly possessed
partially perforated acetabulum, it was pointed out that this partially perforated
state would be due to damage during fossilization and excavation [10, 33]. Hence,
this state (low susceptibility of pelvic anlagen leading to non-perforated
acetabulum) could be relevant to all non-dinosaur archosauromorphs.
RE2-7: Page 5, line 37; ‘Several mechanisms may be proposed for the
acquisition of Wnt ligand susceptibility by the avian pelvic anlagen. E.g.,
heterochrony is supported by the report that the hindlimb develops earlier in
birds than in “reptiles” (albeit, only relative to the forelimb) [46]. The degree
of cartilaginous differentiation of the pelvis might result in different Wnt ligand
susceptibility.’
Even if the avian hindlimb develops earlier than that in “reptiles”, this does not
always mean the avian humerus (including interzone) develops earlier than the
avian pelvis, or the avian pelvis develops earlier than the avian humerus. If the
pelvis and the humerus develop as a single unit as the hindlimb, interaction
between the pelvis and the humerus would not change, if the development of
the hindlimb became earlier than that of the ancestral animals.
AU2-7: First, We wish to clarify that the humerus mentioned above should
be femur. Based on this clarification, we agree with you that the difference
of the timing of hindlimb development does not always mean that the
femur develops earlier than the pelvis. We would like to delete these
sentences because after the first submission, we found that the pelvis
development of both chicken and turtle start after that of the femur, which
suggests that an explanation by heterochrony is not possible.
RE2-8: Page 5, line 39; ‘Heterotopy might be another mechanism. It is
supported by our observation that the chicken pelvis develops at a relatively
dorsal position, while the gecko and turtle pelves develop at relatively ventral
positions (data not shown), leading to the difference in the distance between the
pelvic anlagen (thus, the acetabular region) and the signalling embryonic
tissues, e.g., the cloaca [47], and this might result in different Wnt ligand
susceptibility.’
If this hypothesis is correct, how should we understand the result shown in
Fig.2 (the experiment showed that the perforation is made independent of not
only the axial structures but also the cloaca, namely cell-autonomous
development of the hindlimb skeletons)? And based on this presupposition, the
following experiments appear to be constructed. Thus, the discussion about the
heterotopy seems to harm the value of this paper.
AU2-8: We admit that our explanation was not sufficient.
We think that acetabular perforation of birds does not require inter-tissue
interaction among pelvic anlagen, axial structures, and cloaca (fig.2).
Similarly, we think that such inter-tissue interactions are not necessary to
establish low susceptibility in avian pelvic anlagen. We suppose that the
distance between cloaca and pelvic anlagen is close in “reptiles”, in
contrast to birds, which makes “reptilian” pelvis less susceptible. Actually,
[47] reported that the signals from cloaca and their effect would be more
significant in “reptiles” than in birds. Therefore, we have revised this as;
P5 line252:
this distant relationship in birds might result in high susceptibility to Wnt
ligand.
RE2-9: Page 5, line 42; ‘In an even simpler mechanism, Wnt ligand
susceptibility might be underpinned by an avian-specific highly conserved
genomic element [48], which would modulate certain Wnt signaling
component(s) in the pelvic anlagen.’
I donot know the “avian-specific highly conserved genomic element”, then I
cannot understand its relevance to the Wnt activity.
AU2-9: We are sorry that this expression was not clear to you. We have
tried to clarify it as follows:
P5 line254:
Similarly, Wnt ligand susceptibility might be underpinned by highly
conserved genomic element(s), specific to birds discovered by a previous
study [48], which would modulate certain Wnt signalling component(s) in
the avian pelvic anlagen.
RE2-10: Page 5, line 46; ‘Another challenging issue that should be addressed
concerns establishing whether the mechanism of avian acetabular perforation
can be applied to the majority of basal dinosaurs, whose acetabula are
perforated but the femoral head shape must be mismatched [1, 49-51]. This
requires auxiliary hypotheses, e.g., the one proposed by Charig [1], and a
sophisticated methodology for scientific inference of the morphogenesis in
extinct organisms [Egawa, in prep].’
I cannot understand this sentence completely.
AU2-10: We are sorry that this expression was not clear to you again. We
have tried to clarify it as follows:
P5 line257:
Another challenging issue concerns the detailed analysis of fossil records to test
the hypothetical scenario aforementioned. At a glance, in most basal dinosaurs,
acetabula are perforated but the femoral head shape is mismatched [1, 49-51],
which could not be explained only with the mechanism we elucidate here
(interaction of pelvic anlagen with secretary molecule from the interzone) and
would require auxiliary hypotheses, e.g., the ossification failure proposed by
Charig [1], and a sophisticated methodology for scientific inference of the
morphogenesis in extinct organisms.
RE2-11: Fig. S1
There are not the square and the scale bar in the Fig S1a.
Which stage and why this stage?
AU2-11: Thank you for pointing this out, and we apologize for the
oversight. The square and scale bar in (a) have been added. We have also
added the stage information (HH30) to the legend. We chose this stage
because we used the femoral anlagen and the interzone in the co-culture
experiments in figure 3. To clarify these, we revised the legend as follows:
(a) Histological section of an isolated HH30 (the stage we used for co-culture
experiments) chicken femoral anlagen. (b) The magnification of interzone region.
Appendix C
AU2-2: The reason why we mention shoulder and knee joints here is that the proximal end of the humerus is a
component of the former and the proximal end of the tibia and the distal end of the femur are components of
the latter. For further clarification, we have provided additional information as enclosed in the brackets.
OK, I understand what you want to say. However brackets looked a
little complicated. And I could not find relationship between the
content of the bracket (XX joint component) and “shoulder and knee
joint” in the subordinate clause at first. I would say that “although the
long bones attached to the pelvis WERE not perforated” without
brackets. But it's a matter of your taste.
AU2-8: We admit that our explanation was not sufficient. We think that acetabular perforation of birds does
not require inter-tissue interaction among pelvic anlagen, axial structures, and cloaca (fig.2). Similarly, we
think that such inter-tissue interactions are not necessary to establish low susceptibility in avian pelvic anlagen.
We suppose that the distance between cloaca and pelvic anlagen is close in “reptiles”, in contrast to birds,
which makes “reptilian” pelvis less susceptible. Actually, [47] reported that the signals from cloaca and their
effect would be more significant in “reptiles” than in birds. Therefore, we have revised this as;
(I could not find such a description in the reference 47.)
In Fig 3I, the pelvis was isolated from turtle embryos at TK stages 11-
19 (page 5, line 164). TK stage 11 corresponds to HH 18 chicken
embryo (Nagashima et al., 2005, DOI 10.1002/dvdy.20235), and this
stage is almost the earliest stage when the hindlimb develops (Tokita
and Kuratani, 2001). The turtle pelvis isolated at this early stage did
not have an ability to respond to the perforation signals secreted from
the quail femur (or interzone) (Fig. 3h). According to your heterotopy
hypothesis, the cloaca would have already developed in this early
stage in the chicken and turtle embryos, and there would be difference
in the distance from the hindlimb to the cloaca between the chicken
and turtles in this stage. Am I correct?
Page 4, line 129; ‘figure 1b–e, arrowheads’
Page 4, line 131; ‘‘(figure 1c, arrowheads).’
Page 4, line 132; ‘‘(figure 1e–h).’
Figure numbers are incorrect. Check throughout the draft.
Page 5, line 163; ‘Since it is difficult to clarify stage correspondence among distantly related species, we used
pelves from wide range of stages of “reptiles” (from the stage before pelvic development (TK11, NR6) to the
stage of mature cartilage (TK19, NR24)) from both turtle and gecko to correspond to those of birds.’
As you mentioned, the TK stage 11 is the stage before the pelvic
development, and we cannot isolate the pelvis at this stage. How was
this experiment done? Did you put quail femur on the pelvis developed
from the hindlimb bud in the CAM culture?

To the Editor
We greatly appreciate your valuable editorial inputs. We are especially grateful
to you for providing an additional opportunity to us to revise our manuscript.
We apologize for our poor English. This version of the manuscript has been
checked by an English language editor at Editage, one of the editing companies
that you recommended, and our colleague who is a vertebrate evo-devo
researcher and a native speaker of American English.
Also, we found and supplied some shortage of descriptions and mention to parts
of figures when we checked the pointing out by reviewer 2. For the detail, please
see AU2-3 below.
Please note that since the name of our department has changed, we have revised
this.
To Reviewer 1
RE1-1:
I have one very minor point regarding pg. 1 line 25 which the authors may want
to clarify prior to publication, but does not necessitate further review. The
following sentence is a little unclear: "Similar to birds, the latter may have been
covered by a membrane." By "the latter", are the authors referring to the dinosaur
acetabulum? If so, perhaps the authors could state this rather than "latter" just for
ease of reading.
AU1-1:
We agree that the sentence needed to be made more readable. We have
therefore revised it as follows.
P1, line 35:
‘The perforated acetabulum of dinosaurs may have been covered by a
membrane as in extant birds …’
To Reviewer 2
We really appreciate your careful and in-depth reviewing, which has helped to
greatly improve our manuscript.
RE2-1:
(our previous response)
The reason why we mention shoulder and knee joints here is that the proximal
end of the humerus is a component of the former and the proximal end of the
tibia and the distal end of the femur are components of the latter. For further
clarification, we have provided additional information as enclosed in the
brackets.
OK, I understand what you want to say. However brackets
looked a little complicated. And I could not find relationship
between the content of the bracket (XX joint component) and
“shoulder and knee joint” in the subordinate clause at first. I
would say that “although the long bones attached to the pelvis
WERE not perforated” without brackets. But it's a matter of your
taste.
AU2-1:
Thank you very much for pointing this out. We have removed the brackets,
and to clarify the purpose of using joint components other than the hip, we
have added some sentences before the explanation of the results, as
follows.
P4, lines 175–178:
‘Next, we performed similar experiments with joint components other
than the hip, namely, knee joint components (the distal end of the femur
and the proximal end of the tibia) and shoulder joint components (the
proximal end of the humerus and pectoral girdle). Unlike the hip joint,
neither the knee nor the shoulder joint is perforated during normal
development. ’
We believe you might think that we want to describe that ‘the long bones
attached to the pelvis were not perforated’ as the result of the experiments.
However, what we want to explain here is that joint components other than
the hip (humerus, etc.) are not perforated in their normal state but that they
were not perforated as a result of the experiments. We hope the additional
sentences above resolve this confusion.
RE2-2:
(our previous response)
We admit that our explanation was not sufficient. We think that acetabular
perforation of birds does not require inter-tissue interaction among pelvic
anlagen, axial structures, and cloaca (fig.2). Similarly, we think that such inter-
tissue interactions are not necessary to establish low susceptibility in avian
pelvic anlagen. We suppose that the distance between cloaca and pelvic anlagen
is close in “reptiles”, in contrast to birds, which makes “reptilian” pelvis less
susceptible. Actually, [47] reported that the signals from cloaca and their effect
would be more significant in “reptiles” than in birds. Therefore, we have revised
this as;
(I could not find such a description in the reference 47.)
In Fig 3I, the pelvis was isolated from turtle embryos at TK
stages 11-19 (page 5, line 164). TK stage 11 corresponds to HH
18 chicken embryo (Nagashima et al., 2005, DOI
10.1002/dvdy.20235), and this stage is almost the earliest
stage when the hindlimb develops (Tokita and Kuratani, 2001).
The turtle pelvis isolated at this early stage did not have an
ability to respond to the perforation signals secreted from the
quail femur (or interzone) (Fig. 3h). According to your
heterotopy hypothesis, the cloaca would have already
developed in this early stage in the chicken and turtle embryos,
and there would be difference in the distance from the hindlimb
to the cloaca between the chicken and turtles in this stage. Am
I correct?
AU2-2:
We apologize that our explanation was speculative and could be
misinterpreted.
The reason why we wrote ‘Actually, [47] reported that the signals from
cloaca and their effect would be more significant in “reptiles” than in
birds’ is based on the following text from the reference [47]:
([47] reports cloaca can induce external genitalia)
We propose that repositioning the cloaca can recruit
different mesenchymal cell populations, either through
spatial or heterochronic changes in the dynamics of their
emergence. In squamates, the hindlimb is the dominant
source ..…. In mice, limbs and genitals have discrete
developmental origins—the LPM and the ventral and tail bud
mesenchyme, respectively—with chicken showing an
intermediate state.

2014;516(7531):391-4.10.1038/nature13819
We admit that our explanation (Actually, [47] reported that…) was
overstated and additional explanation was necessary.
Your interpretation of our heterotopy hypothesis is correct. We think that
signals from the cloaca can affect the property of the hindlimb
mesenchyme (i.e. the cell origin of the pelves) at stages as early as TK11
(turtle) and HH18 (chicken). Furthermore, such effects on the hindlimb
mesenchyme could be limited at stages earlier than TK11 (turtle) and
HH18 (chicken), because the signal responsible for genitalia induction
from the cloaca is expressed at such early stages, as far as we explore

However, since this hypothesis might be too speculative, we would like to
retract it. Instead, we have simplified this section as follows.
P6, lines 264–267:
‘The elucidation of the mechanisms for the acquisition of Wnt ligand
susceptibility in the avian pelvic anlagen is the next challenge. It might be
underlain by differences in inter-tissue interaction such as heterochrony
and heterotopy or by highly conserved genomic element(s), specific to
birds discovered by a previous study [48]. Molecular and experimental
embryological analyses will shed light on this issue.’

AU2-3:
We apologize for these errors. We have made the necessary corrections.
Also, we apologize for other shortage of descriptions and mention to parts
of figures, which we newly found. We revise and supply the sentences as

the turtle hip region, we found the expression of noggin in the femoral
anlagen (figure 5f,h), chordin and wnt4 in a part of its interzone (figure
5g,i,j). In the chicken hip region, we found the expression of noggin in the
femoral anlagen (figure 5k,m), chordin in the entire interzone (figure 5l,n)

both turtle and gecko to correspond to those of birds.’
As you mentioned, the TK stage 11 is the stage before the pelvic
development, and we cannot isolate the pelvis at this stage.
How was this experiment done? Did you put quail femur on the
pelvis developed from the hindlimb bud in the CAM culture?

anchored to each other with tungsten needles. For limb buds, we anchored
the long bone anlagen to their medial side.’
Incidentally, we are also sorry that we missed some explanation for the
stage of anlagen used. We have added a statement as follows.
