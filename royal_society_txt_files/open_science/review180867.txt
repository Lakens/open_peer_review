The manuscript entitled “Tailoring morphology of cobalt-nickel layered double hydroxide via
different surfactants for high-performance supercapacitor” reports the synthesis of cobalt-nickel
layered double hydroxide with three surfactants, structure, morphology, and electrochemical
property of the three materials, and their performance for asymmetric supercapacitors when
assembled with activated carbon cathode. The corresponding analyses, such as ICP-OES, XRD,
FTIR, XPS, SEM, TEM, CV, Charge/discharge curves, specific capacitance and Cycle performance
are carried out in the manuscript. The key contribution is three surfactants modified the
morphologies of cobalt-nickel LDHs resulting in enhanced electrochemical performance.
Technical clarifications were made to make sure the performance of the proposed asymmetric
configuration can be translated to a practical device. This work is well done with some
originality. The paper is written clearly and is easy to follow. But the following points should be
addressed:
1. What is the mass loading of Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2:H, Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2:D, and
Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2:C (e.g. how many mg/cm2?) used in 3-electrode cells? And in asymmetric
supercapacitors? How does it affect the capacitance and rate capability?
2. Statistic data need to be stated explicitly. For example, how many electrodes of each type were
tested? What was the variation in performance for measurements with multiple sets of
electrodes?

The authors tailor the morphology of cobalt-nickel layered double hydroxide (LDH) electrode
material via the process of cathodic electrodeposition by adding different surfactants. The as-
prepared Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2 samples with surfactants exhibited wrinkle-like, cauliflower-like, or
net-like structures that corresponded to better electrochemical performances than the untreated
one. However, many issues should be addressed before it to be published in Royal Society Open
Science.
1. The insight reasons for the formation of different morphologies with different surfactants
should be further discussed.
2. As we known, the substrates play important roles in the electrodeposition. The nickel foam was
used as substrate for the working electrodes for electrochemical measurements, while the
stainless steel was used as the substrate to deposited the LDH for XRD analysis. The reasons
should be given.
3. The Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2: C shows the highest specific capacitance at all the current densities
from 0.2 to 5 A g-1 among all the four Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2 samples. However, the

Answer:
Thank you very much for your kind comments and good suggestions!
The answers to your questions and changes according to your
suggestions are listed as follows:
Questions:
1. What is the mass loading of Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2:H,
Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2:D, and Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2:C (e.g. how many mg/cm2?)
used in 3-electrode cells? And in asymmetric supercapacitors? How
does it affect the capacitance and rate capability?
Answer:
Thank you for your kind questions.
According to the following Table 1, the mass loadings of
Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2 (0.59 mg/cm2), Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2: H (0.75 mg/cm2),
Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2: D (0.78 mg/cm2), Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2: C (0.76 mg/cm2)
were calculated respectively. Compared with the Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2
electrode, the Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2 LDHs within surfactants show more
mass loadings (<U+0394>m) as well as total applied charges (Q) under the
same electrodeposition condition, because the surfactants can enhance
the conductivity of the aqueous solution and promote the formation of
Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2 LDHs [1]. The similar mass loading for each kind of
Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2 LDHs was applied in asymmetric supercapacitors.
The effect of surfactant was discussed under the same experimental
procedure. And the mass loading would be changed by changing the
electrodeposition condition such as the potential or time. Therefore,
we did not discuss the relationship between mass loading and
electrochemical performance in this manuscript. We appreciate your
questions very much, the influence of mass loading would be further
discussed in our next experiments.

electrodes of each type were tested? What was the variation in
performance for measurements with multiple sets of electrodes?
Answer:
Thank you very much for your kind suggestions!
Three electrodes of each type active material were tested to measure
their electrochemical performances at least, as shown in Fig.2, the
specific capacitances of Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2: C electrodes were 1038 F
g-1, 1046 F g-1 and 1169 F g-1 at the current density of 8 A g-1,
respectively. The second one (1046 F g-1) was adopted in our
manuscript. There are few variations in electrochemical performances.

The answers to your questions and changes according to your

Questions:
1. The insight reasons for the formation of different morphologies with
different surfactants should be further discussed.
Answer:
We appreciate your suggestion very much and according to this
comment, we explained the affects of surfactants as follow.
The effects of surfactant vary with the interactions with precursor, and
the surfactant head and hydrocarbon tail could lead to new orders at
the interface and/or inside the system to some extent [2]. Meanwhile,
the surfactant can lower the surface tension of the solution [1]. Under
the electrodeposition condition, the HMT probably hydrolyses to form
the complex (CH2)6N4H4+) in the presence of distilled water and
generates the OH- ions [3][4]; meanwhile, as DTAB and CTAB ionize
and provide extra ions, thus enhancing the conductivity of the aqueous
solution. The surfactant cations (CH2)6N4H4+, DTA+, CTA+) can be
electrostatically adsorbed on the negatively charged surface of
working electrode [5] and are expected to serve as templates. The
different structures of three surfactants play key roles to sort of
forming the morphology of electrode materials. (CH2)6N4H4+ is a
compound with a cage like structure [6], and the relative uniform
winkles are formed. Compared with CTA+, the DTA+ as a template
owns a shorter carbon chain length; so the single nano-sheet length
(100-200 nm) of Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2: D is shorter than that (500-600 nm)
of Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2: C [7], which tends to aggregate to reduce the
surface energy from a thermodynamic perspective [8]. Thus, the
smaller nano-sheets are relatively inclined to form a 3D cauliflower
structure by self-assembling. On the basis of the information we have
gathered, we suggested a possible growth mechanism of
Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2 LDHs in Fig.3. And according to your kind
suggestions, we have used this for the explanation of the formation
mechanism of different morphologies with relative different
surfactants in our manuscript section 4.1 compositions and growth
mechanism (manuscript in marked version, Page 4, 10th line).

2. As we known, the substrates play important roles in the
electrodeposition. The nickel foam was used as substrate for the
working electrodes for electrochemical measurements, while the
stainless steel was used as the substrate to deposit the LDH for XRD
analysis. The reasons should be given.
Answer:
We appreciate your suggestion very much and according to this
comment, we explained the reason of stainless substrate used for the
XRD test in detail.
For one thing, the X-ray diffraction instrument requires the surface of
the sample be a very flat surface. The deviation of the surface of the
specimen from the real plane (irregular surface, uneven, protruding or
sunken, etc.) will cause the diffraction ray width, displacement and
make the intensity of complex changes. And the macroporous nickel
foam has an uneven surface; it is not fit for the test requirement of
XRD. For another, the background peaks of nickel foam are very
strong, which would disturb the diffraction peaks of electrode
materials; so the cleaned stainless steel was employed to act as a
substrate for the XRD test. There are some reports by using two kinds
of substrates during the electrodeposition process to satisfy the needs
of different tests. Wang et al adopted carbon paper for the
electrochemical test and stainless steel sheet for XRD test respectively
[9]. And Zeng et al also fabricated the electrode material by depositing
on the carbon paper and stainless steel for different tests [10]. We have
added the reason of stainless substrate used for the XRD test
(manuscript in marked version, Page 4, 12th line from the bottom).

3. The Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2: C shows the highest specific capacitance at
all the current densities from 0.2 to 5 A g-1 among all the four
Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2 samples. However, the Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2: D//AC
ASC with the Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2: D as the positive electrode exhibit the
best performance. The reasons should be carefully discussed. Does the
assembly of these ASCs with same conditions?
Answer:
We appreciate your kind suggestion and question very much!
All the ASCs were assembled under the same conditions. The reasons
for best electrochemical performance were discussed as follows:
In the determined volume of ASCs, the volume swelling of the net-like
structure of Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2: C electrode may destroy the intrinsic
structure during the ions intercalation and de-intercalation processes
[11]. However, the cauliflower-like Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2: D has many
interspaces between the particles, which allow the volume expansion
to take place easily, and promote the high distribution of active sites as
well as high speed pathway for continuous electronic and ionic
transportation [12]. The superior electrical conductivity as a decisive
factor has a great improvement for rate capability and cycle life [13].
The rate capability and cycle life are also key factors for evaluating the
practical applications of the supercapacitors, the stable reversible
characteristic of the cauliflower-like Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2: D is more
attractive. We have amended our manuscript (manuscript in marked
version, page 8 first line). This could partially explain the better rate
ability and cycling stability of the Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2: D//AC
asymmetric cell, but situations of inner electrochemical resistance in a
cell may be more complicated compared to those in a three-electrode
system. Thus more explorations are necessary for further improvement
of relevant devices.
