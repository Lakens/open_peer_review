Zhang and Xu used mesoporous silica nanospeheres to deliver anticancer drug, doxorubicin. The
functionalization of silica by PEG and targeting molecules make the carrier multifunctional. The
project is designed and carried out carefully. The manuscript is well written. I recommend to
publish after minor revisions.
I believe the authors performed multiple experiments for drug release. I suggest them to use error
bars in Figure 3 b.
Silica is widely used biomaterials. How about its biodegradability?

The manuscript by Zhang et al. entitled Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticle-Based Intelligent Drug
Delivery System for Bienzyme-Responsive Targeting to Cancer Cells and Controlled Release was
compiled well with different experiments right from the synthesis to characterization and cell
experiments. However, I have a few concerns to improve the quality of the paper.
Physical characterization of all samples by NMR and FTIR are necessary to evaluate each and
every modification on MSNs.
Citations need to be updated, I suggest authors should cite recent intelligent nanocarriers for Dox

Dear editor,
Thank you very much for your and reviewers’ comments on our manuscript titled “Mesoporous Silica
Nanoparticle-Based Intelligent Drug Delivery System for Bienzyme-Responsive Targeting to Cancer Cells
and Controlled Release” (Manuscript ID: RSOS-170986). We have made careful modification on the
original manuscript. The answers to the questions have been listed below and addressed in the text
itself. To be easily identified, a list of changes is also provided.
Once again, we acknowledge your comments and constructive suggestions very much, which are
valuable in improving the quality of our manuscript.
Thank you for your attention and we are looking forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely yours,
Juan Xu, PhD
Doctor of Tengzhou Central People's Hospital

Response to the reviewers’ comments
Reviewer #1: Zhang and Xu used mesoporous silica nanospeheres to deliver anticancer drug,
doxorubicin. The functionalization of silica by PEG and targeting molecules make the carrier
multifunctional. The project is designed and carried out carefully. The manuscript is well written. I
recommend to publish after minor revisions.
Question 1: I believe the authors performed multiple experiments for drug release. I suggest them to
use error bars in Figure 3 b.
Answer: Thanks for your good suggestions. We have revised it in the revised manuscript.
Question 2: Silica is widely used biomaterials. How about its biodegradability?
Answer: Silica has good compatibility and is accepted as “Generally Recognized As Safe” (GRAS) by the
FDA and has been widely used in cosmetics and as FDA-approved food additives. Moreover, the
excretion study could clarify that MSN can be degraded in vivo. But the rate of degradation is directly
related to their size, shape, surface property, and structure (Adv. Mater. 2012, 24, 1504–1534).
Reviewer #2: The manuscript by Zhang et al. entitled Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticle-Based Intelligent
Drug Delivery System for Bienzyme-Responsive Targeting to Cancer Cells and Controlled Release was
compiled well with different experiments right from the synthesis to characterization and cell
experiments. However, I have a few concerns to improve the quality of the paper.
Question 1: Physical characterization of all samples by NMR and FTIR are necessary to evaluate each
and every modification on MSNs.
Answer: This is a good question. Because HA and gelatin contain many similar groups, it is difficult to
evaluate each and every modification on MSNs by NMR and FTIR. Quantification of all modification
processes were accomplished by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Figure S3, the weight
loss values of unloaded NH2-MSN, MSN@HA, MSN@HA@Gelatin, and MHGP were 4.9%, 12.4%, 24.2%,
30.4%, respectively, when the temperature increased to 800 °C. The immobilized mass percentage of
HA, gelatin, and PEG was approximately 7.5%, 11.8%, and 6.2% respectively, which also reflected the
successful modification of each functional unit.

Question 2: Citations need to be updated, I suggest authors should cite recent intelligent nanocarriers
for Dox delivery, DOI: 10.1039/c6tb03146c, 10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00569
Answer: Thank you, we have added some recent references.
