This paper is a valuable contribution to our understanding of the extreme diving behavior in this
species and is particularly relevant given the potential disturbance from human activities off
Cape Hatteras.
Please see my attached file for detailed comments (Appendix A).
I found it annoying that the line numbers on each page did not align properly with the actual
lines of text and suggest correcting this before submitting for further review.

This paper clearly and concisely summarizes the diving behavior of Cuvier’s beaked whales
tagged off Cape Hatteras. The methods and results are easy to follow, and the discussion clearly
follows from the data presented. There are a few places that could benefit from clarification or re-
wording, and a few places where I believe references need to be added, but these are all minor
changes.
Page 2, line 43: The Wildlife Computers LIMPET tag used in this study is now officially referred
to by the manufacturer as the “SPLASH10-292” (See https://wildlifecomputers.com/wp-
content/uploads/mds/LIMPET-Tag-Suite-Specifications.pdf). Suggest fixing throughout.
Page 2, line 47. Stating tags are ‘designed to operate up to 1000 or 2000m’ suggests that they
3
won’t work beyond that point. Suggest clarifying that tags are calibrated to X meters with the
corresponding manufacturer stated resolution, and clarify a pressure transducer that is designed
not to exceed 3,000m.
Page 3 line 10: Argos is not an acronym, only the first letter should be capitalized. Fix throughout.
Page 3, line 44: You should reference testing these transducers to 3000m, e.g. Wildlife Computers
or Schorr et al. (2014). This could help with the previous comment about tags functioning beyond
their ‘rated’ depth.
Page 3, Line 52: The results (e.g. Page 5, line 46 and figure 4) suggest substantial variability
between individual, with the range of individual median dive depths spanning almost 600m. In
the discussion, individual variability is also highlighted. Based on this, why did you choose to
pool your data in order to determine the deep vs shallow dive cutoff? The cutoff applied to one
individual with a more limited sample could be substantially biased if it was influenced by a
large number of data points from another animal behaving very differently. The scatter plot in
figure 2 does not easily allow a reader to assess the degree to which individual data might be
influencing pooled metrics, given the overall number of data points displayed. A hard cutoff
doesn’t deal well with the tails in the distribution of deep and shallow dives per individual
(Figures 4 &5). While there is likely only a fraction of dives that may be classified differently,
given the emphasis on individual variability in the discussion, the authors should better qualify
why/how pooling data for this important cutoff was chosen.
Page 5, line 60. Having referenced the term ‘extreme’ to previously describe beaked whale
behavior, I understand the point- particularly with respect to other species. However, stating that
thier diving is both extreme and habitual in the same sentence seems a contradiction of terms. At
this stage in our understanding of beaked whale diving, the data convincingly suggest that
diving to depths greater than 1500m is routine for this species, so I would suggest moving away
from representing ‘habitual’ behavior of beaked whales as extreme behavior.
Page 6, Line 17-24. This section is a bit hard to follow and understand. Overall, the paragraph
reads as if focused on deep dive interval (IDDI) as a function of recovery time. The third sentence
states that pilot whales average 8-12 minutes between foraging dives (i.e. a short IDDI) but then
states that pilot whales spend long periods near the surface between foraging dives. That time
should be included in the IDDI, so if that is 8-12 minutes, pilot whales would appear to spend
(proportionately) much more time on deep foraging dives, not “a comparable amount over an
entire diel cycle”. Ultimately, this section seems to confound IDDI, foraging rates, surface
intervals (as defined by tags in this study), and time near the surface (as referenced for other
species) across species, and could stand to be rewritten to clarify the underlying point.
Page 6, line 60 to page 7 line 6. This section should reference Schorr et al. (2014), Tyack et al.
(2015) and Schorr et al. (2015), all of which explore this point in detail for Cuvier’s beaked whales.

changing the word from ‘Our study INDICATES…’ to ‘Our study CONFIRMS…’ since you
reference a previous study having described this.

based receivers are utilized (Jeanniard-du-Dot et al., 2017)’, or similar. Also, if the journal has
issues with references that can’t be accessed in any way at the time of publication, in addition to
the unpublished manuscript you might also reference a gray literature article dealing specifically
with this issue.

Page 8 line 24: I agree that sensor issues have not always been addressed in detail in previous
peer-reviewed literature, and I commend the authors for more fully discussing this issue and
how it was dealt with. However in regards to data gaps and other limitations of the tags not
having been acknowledged, several studies on beaked whales using LIMPET tags referenced in
your paper have acknowledged/addressed at least some of the limitations of these tags (e.g. the
presence and influence of data gaps, the limitations of summarized data, etc), at least to some
degree (see Schorr et al., 2014 & 2015, Joyce et al. 2016, Jeanniard-du-Dot et al., 2017). This
statement should identify specific data issues that have not been adequately addressed, and/or
these references should be added.
Page 8 line 27: Clarify how your data identifies the need for tags to transmit data “more quickly”,
since this doesn’t seem clear from the above. Is this need based on Argos message length or size
(e.g. faster transmission would allow for transmission of longer or larger messages)? Also, stating
there is a need for tags capable of “handling the extraordinary diving capabilities” suggests that
the tags you and previous authors are using are not. As this is the final sentence of the discussion,
it should be more clearly supported by the data discussed above.
Page 8 line 42. Following the previous comment, again what exactly is meant by ‘…develop tags
capable of accurately measuring behavior at the extreme depths at which these animals forage’?
Are you referring only to the need for a LIMPET tag with a deeper rated pressure sensor? Suggest
re-wording this sentence since you describe all of the deep dives in your dataset as extreme, so
this could be read to suggest that the tag used here (or any other tag currently available) is not
capable of ‘accurately’ measuring behavior.
Page 22, line 30. You state the 800 m cutoff has been used “previously” to segregate deep and
shallow dives classes, but this does not appear to be referenced elsewhere in the manuscript. See
also previous comment about using this cutoff limit. Please add a reference or clarify.

Appendix A
Ziphius Diving Behavior Cape Hatteras
General Overview
This paper contributes valuable information on the diving behavior of a
species that is vulnerable to disturbance in an area of high human use.
Comments:
Summary
Page 1 Line 34: Given the difficulty in sexing Zc at sea, how confident are you
that all animals are adults?
I suggest adding a sentence about the value of these data for a species
vulnerable to noise disturbance in an area with regular military activity and
oil and gas exploration.
Introduction
Page 1 Line 3: Should scientific names be given for all species?
Page 2 Line 8: Add clarification that the deepest and longest duration dive
that Schorr et al 2014 report could have been by a whale exposed to navy
sonar.
Were any of the tagged whales in this study subjected to CEEs or real sonar
activities?
Page 2 Line 17: Is succeeding the correct word, not preceding?
Page 2 Lines 18-19: One case or reported in one study?
Starting at paragraph 2 (Line 15), I suggest focusing on what’s known about
the diving behavior just for Ziphius and not for all beaked whale species
(where data exist). This would add clarity to the writing and eliminate
awkward sentences, e.g., Page 2 Lines 26-29 could be stated more clearly if
just providing background on Ziphius and not M densirostris as well.
Page 2 Line 31: Forney et al 2017 is not the correct citation for strong site
fidelity of Ziphius at Cape Hatteras. That paper references Baird RW, Webster
DL, Swaim Z, Foley HJ, Anderson DB, Read AJ (2016) Spatial use by
odontocetes satellite tagged off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, in 2015.
Report prepared for US Fleet Forces Command, Norfolk, VA. The telemetry
data presented in Baird et al’s report appears to be the same as what you are
presenting here (your Fig 1).
Page 2 Line 33: Add a sentence here about the human uses of the study area
(military exercises, oil and gas exploration, fishing, ship traffic) to
demonstrate the need for understanding diving behavior for this species in
this location as that is the data gap addressed in this study. You could
reference Forney et al here.

classification, as you later note.
Page 2 Line 58: You should add a cautionary statement about the difficulty in
distinguishing adult females from subadult males.
Page 2 Lines 58-60: You need to clarify that you mean you were able to

not that the pigmentation predisposed them to tagging! Also, what
behaviour are you referring to? Lagging behind the rest of the group?
Surfacing more often?

Discussion
Page 5 Line 53 – Page 6 line 33: This section on extreme diving and IDDI
doesn’t present anything new to past discussions or use the findings from
this study to advance the discussion so although it is well-written, I suggest
removing this section from the manuscript.

and what max depths were possible given the whales’ locations? Were the
whales diving to the bottom in all cases?

namely California and Liguria.
Page 7 Lines 8-10: Note that to include more information on age and sex of
tagged whales, getting ID photos and biopsy samples from tagged whales will
need to be more of a priority.
Page 7 Lines 21-23: Future use of a goniometer for real-time tracking will
help improve location resolution and aid in more accurate bathymetry.
Page 7 Lines 39-46: Are there sightings data for killer whales off Cape
Hatteras that can be referenced here to help explain the diel difference
found in this study?
Page 7 Line 48 – Page 8 Line 6: I found this section weak in content and
poorly written, e.g., there aren’t “many” prior studies using short-term tags.
It could be rewritten more succinctly and needs additional references added.
I think that the combination of behavioural data from short-term, high
resolution tags with long-term tags is ideal. Each has its own strengths. Also,
it is probably clearer to use suction-cup/Dtags and LIMPET tags rather than
short and long term because some of the LIMPET deployments are actually
short-term.
Page 8 Line 2: I think you mean that not all individuals were fully sampled.
Also adding the use of a goniometer will aid in re-sighting the tagged whale
to increase opportunities for photo-id and biopsy to confirm sex.
Also, I’d like to see some discussion about TagZc051. Why do you think it
behaved differently?

occasionally diving…

Dear Dr. Sanders
Enclosed and uploaded please find our revised manuscript entitled “Diving behavior
of Cuvier’s beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. We
would like to express our sincere appreciation to you, the Associate Editor, and the
two Reviewers. The comments have greatly improved our manuscript.
Below we respond to each Reviewer’s comments in turn (our responses are in blue)
and describe how we have modified the manuscript in response to their
suggestions. We have also uploaded a version of the manuscript with tracked
changes to show the edits we made.
Please let us know if there is any other information you require to consider this
revised manuscript.
Sincerely,
Jeanne Shearer
Andrew Read
Reviewer 1:
General Overview
This paper contributes valuable information on the diving behavior of a species that
is
vulnerable to disturbance in an area of high human use.
We greatly appreciate this reviewer for their helpful and thorough comments which
have significantly improved our manuscript. We have answered specific comments
and questions below.
Comments:
Page 1 Line 34: Given the difficulty in sexing Zc at sea, how confident are you that all
animals
are adults?
We thank the reviewer for this point and agree with the difficulty of sexing Zc. We
did not determine gender or age class at sea, but rather made these determinations
in the laboratory through photo-identification and review of tagging videos. We are
very confident of the gender of six adult males and one of the adult females
(ZcTag047), which was seen in previous years with a dependent calf. Researchers
from two laboratories independently assessed the images and determined gender
and age classes. Given the difficulties in determining age class of unmarked animals,
we have updated Table 2 to state ‘likely’ adult females for those animals that were
not seen with a calf and deleted the ‘adult whale’ qualifier from this sentence in the
abstract, per the reviewer’s suggestion.
I suggest adding a sentence about the value of these data for a species vulnerable to
noise
disturbance in an area with regular military activity and oil and gas exploration.
We have made this change on Page 2 Line 33(see below) but have not added
anything to the Abstract as we are already at the word limit.
Page 1 Line 3: Should scientific names be given for all species?
We have made this change.
Page 2 Line 8: Add clarification that the deepest and longest duration dive that
Schorr et al
2014 report could have been by a whale exposed to navy sonar.
We have added the following clarification: “…southern California, although it is
possible that these animals were exposed to Navy sonar during those deployments.”
and have cited the formal comment to the Schorr et al. 2014 paper as well as the
rebuttal to that comment.
Were any of the tagged whales in this study subjected to CEEs or real sonar
activities?
None of the whales in this study were subject to CEEs and to the best of our
knowledge, were not exposed to real sonar activities.
Page 2 Line 17: Is succeeding the correct word, not preceding?
For clarity, we have edited that sentence to use the word ‘following’ rather than
succeeding, as well as making other edits to the sentence based on reviewer
feedback (see comments below).
Page 2 Lines 18-19: One case or reported in one study?
This was no longer included per the suggestion to focus on Cuvier’s beaked whales
(see comment below).
Starting at paragraph 2 (Line 15), I suggest focusing on what’s known about the
diving
behavior just for Ziphius and not for all beaked whale species (where data exist).
This would
add clarity to the writing and eliminate awkward sentences, e.g., Page 2 Lines 26-29
could
be stated more clearly if just providing background on Ziphius and not M
densirostris as
well.
We agree that this would add clarity to this paragraph. We have edited that
paragraph to include only Cuvier’s beaked whales and have adjusted the references
accordingly.
Page 2 Line 31: Forney et al 2017 is not the correct citation for strong site fidelity of
Ziphius
at Cape Hatteras. That paper references Baird RW, Webster DL, Swaim Z, Foley HJ,
Anderson
DB, Read AJ (2016) Spatial use by odontocetes satellite tagged off Cape Hatteras,
North
Carolina, in 2015. Report prepared for US Fleet Forces Command, Norfolk, VA. The
telemetry data presented in Baird et al’s report appears to be the same as what you
are
presenting here (your Fig 1).
We have updated the references to remove the Forney et al. 2017 paper and added
the original papers Baird et al. 2015, 2016, 2017, which utilize the satellite tags
reported on here as well as additional location only tags not included in the current
study.
Page 2 Line 33: Add a sentence here about the human uses of the study area
(military
exercises, oil and gas exploration, fishing, ship traffic) to demonstrate the need for
understanding diving behavior for this species in this location as that is the data gap
addressed in this study. You could reference Forney et al here.
We have added the following sentence: “These data address a gap in knowledge for
this species occurring in an area with multiple human uses, from occasional military
exercises to extensive fishing and shipping traffic and the recent potential for
offshore seismic surveys (Forney et al. 2017).”
Page 2 Lines 45-46: Add citation after tag configuration Andrews R, Pitman R,
Ballance L

killer
whales in the southern Ross Sea, Antarctica. Polar Biol 31: 1461–1468.
doi:10.1007/s00300-
008-0487-z.
We have added this citation.
Page 2 Lines 45-46: “on” the dorsal fin, not “into”
We have made this edit.
Page 2 Lines 47-49: Can you explain what is meant by the tags were designed to
operate to
1000 and 2000m depths?
This was also addressed by Reviewer 2. The text now reads: “Nine tags were in an
extended depth configuration (calibrated to 2000 m with a 1 m resolution, with a
pressure sensor designed not to exceed 3000 m). Two additional tags (ZcTag046 and
ZcTag047) were in a standard depth configuration (calibrated to 1000 m with a 0.5
m resolution, with a pressure sensor designed to survive depths of 2000 m).”
Page 2 Line 49: What type of pneumatic rifle was used? Give manufacturer’s info,
etc.
We have added the manufacturer’s info (DAN-INJECT JM 25, DanWild LLC, Austin,
Texas).
Page 2 Lines 53-54: Re: photo-identification, add that you compared identifications
with a
catalogue of known individuals from the study area to aid in designating sex for
individuals
with prior sighting histories.
We have added the following sentence: “Photos were compared with a catalogue of
known individuals from the study area to aid in designating sex and age classes for
individuals with a prior or subsequent sighting record.”
Page 2 Lines 54-55: Add ref MCCANN, C. 1974. Body scarring on Cetacea-
Odontocetes. Scientific
Report of the Whales Research Institute 26:145-155.
We have added this citation.
Also, add that white pigmentation on the male’s head helped with classification, as
you later
note.
We have added this clarification.
Page 2 Line 58: You should add a cautionary statement about the difficulty in
distinguishing
adult females from subadult males.
We agree with the reviewer and have added the following sentence: “Without the
presence of a calf, it is difficult to distinguish adult females from subadult males. All
classifications were made independently by two laboratories and sighting histories
and videos of tagging attempts for some of the animals increase our confidence in
our classifications.”
Page 2 Lines 58-60: You need to clarify that you mean you were able to classify adult
males
more easily due to the white pigmentation on the head, not that the pigmentation
predisposed them to tagging! Also, what behavior are you referring to? Lagging
behind the
rest of the group? Surfacing more often?
We agree with the reviewer that this sentence was ambiguous and have changed it
to read: “Our sample of tagged individuals is biased toward males because the
distinctive white pigmentation makes them more visible to observers and easier to
track during tagging attempts. The white pigmentation and linear scarring in males
increases our confidence in their classification.” We have removed the statement
about behavior as we have only anecdotal evidence for this claim.
Page 3 Lines 4-5: The Satellite Tag section could be named Satellite Tag
Programming
We have made this edit.
Page 3 Line 7: How were the tags programmed and why 20 hrs per day?
Tags were programmed using Wildlife Computers Mk10Host program. They were
set to transmit for 20 hours a day based on an analysis of satellite overpasses.
Periods of low quality or no satellite passes were turned off to conserve battery.
Page 3 Lines 9-13: The gaps in tag data record that you encountered could be
moved to
Error Checks or Results sections. That way, you can also address how you dealt with
these
gaps.
We agree with this suggestion and have moved the sentences on gaps to the end of
the first paragraph under ‘error checks’ and have added the following sentence:
“We omitted these gaps from all calculated statistics (e.g. inter-deep dive intervals
were not calculated when a gap occurred between deep dives, and surface duration
statistics were not calculated when a gap occurred immediately before or after a
dive).”
Page 3 Line 15: Why 50 m?
Time at the surface was defined as time between dives exceeding 50 meters to
avoid generating excessive numbers of shallow inter-ventilation submergences,
which would increase the number of messages to transmit. This is also the definition
used by Baird et al. 2008 and Schorr et al. 2014.
Page 3 Lines 16-18: Explain why max depths are recorded as 2 values.
Wildlife Computers records depth in the behavior log as a maximum and minimum
value for the depth of the dive and they state that the true value of the dive depth is
between these two values.
Page 3 Lines 26-27: e.g. instead of i.e.
We have made this edit.
Page 3 Lines 29-35: Tag programming for the time series data may be better placed
in the
section above.
We agree and have made this change.
Page 3 Line 46: Weren’t all other dives were retained not just the subsequent dives?
We have changed the line to read “… we retained all other dives in our analysis.”
Page 4 Lines 15-17: What manner are you referring to?
We were referring to the fact that the behavior log only records the depth and
duration of the dive. It does not record a time series of the dive (except for
occasional duty-cycled time series measurements used to verify summarized data)
and thus we have no means of calculating the percent of time spent in each depth
layer on the dive.
Page 4 Lines 33-35: I’d be cautious about stating adult female classifications and
also about
adult classifications for the individuals of unknown sex. Is it possible that one or
more of the
females could be sub-adult males and/or the unknown adults could be sub-adults?
How
many of the tagged whales were photo-identified? Were there any animals known
previously?
We agree that it is possible that some of our animals of unknown sex could be sub-
adults and we have updated Table 2 to reflect this possibility. We have changed
these lines in the methods to state: “Most (six) of the tagged whales were adult
males, one was an adult female, two were likely adult females, and two were likely
adult males.”
Three of 11 animals had prior sighting histories (ZcTag030, ZcTag040 and ZcTag047)
while 4 of 11 have been resighted after tagging (ZcTag029, ZcTag040, ZcTag046,
ZcTag047). ZcTag047 (adult female) was seen two years prior to tagging with a
dependent calf. ZcTag029 (likely adult female) was seen 4 years following tagging;
its size, lack of scarring and clear head shot showing no erupted teeth in this sighting
increase our confidence in classifying this animal as an adult female.
Page 4 Lines 38-40: Move and combine this sentence to the above section (line 8)
where
you say why both medians and means are given, i.e., to show skewness and allow
comparison to other studies.
Thank you, we have made this edit.
Page 5 Line 2: You need to define the word “surface”, i.e., any time <50m and not at
the
surface for the entire time, except when logging.
We agree with the reviewer and have changed the heading from “Surface Behavior”
to “Surface (<50 m depth) Behavior”.
Page 5 Lines 4-5: At or near the surface.
Thank you, we have made this edit.
Page 5 Lines 7-8: Do the time series data suggest these animals were logging during
these
extended bouts, especially the 310 min surfacing interval?
There are no time series data for the 310 min surfacing interval. For periods in
which long surface intervals overlap with time series data, animals do not appear to
be logging but instead perform dives of 10-40 meters.
Page 5 Lines 33-35: You have already noted that there were more shallow dives
during the
day (line 32).
We have edited this sentence to remove that statement.
Page 5 Lines 42-47: Omit this section as it is relevant to the Discussion.
We agree with the reviewer and have removed this section.
Page 5 Line 53 – Page 6 line 33: This section on extreme diving and IDDI doesn’t
present
anything new to past discussions or use the findings from this study to advance the
discussion so although it is well-written, I suggest removing this section from the
manuscript.
We have removed most of this section from the manuscript. We have retained the
lines at the beginning summarizing the findings and a few from the end of the
section raising new research questions for these animals.
Page 6 Lines 44-46: How does the water depth vary between these locations and
what max
depths were possible given the whales’ locations? Were the whales diving to the
bottom in
all cases?
We agree with the reviewer that this information would be very interesting and
would certainly add useful context. Unfortunately, given the complex topography of
the area and the large error radius of the position data from Service Argos, it is
impossible to know whether they are diving to the bottom. This is information we
would love to have and hope that in the future it will be available.
Page 6 Lines 53-54: Give the areas where the parameters are available, namely
California
and Liguria.
Thank you, we have made this addition.
Page 7 Lines 8-10: Note that to include more information on age and sex of tagged
whales,
getting ID photos and biopsy samples from tagged whales will need to be more of a
priority.
We agree with the reviewer on this point and have edited this sentence to read:
“Increasing sample size and including information on the sex and age of the tagged
animal (through increasing effort to obtain biopsy samples and ID photos) would
help determine if there are age or sex class differences in behavior in addition to
population level differences.”
Emphasis on collecting photos of both sides of all group members, as well as
targeting tagged animals for biopsy sampling have been a priority in later field
seasons in this area. Seven biopsies were collected in 2018 (2 of tagged animals),
more than all prior field seasons combined.
Page 7 Lines 21-23: Future use of a goniometer for real-time tracking will help
improve
location resolution and aid in more accurate bathymetry.
We agree. We have utilized a goniometer in later field seasons in this area.
Page 7 Lines 39-46: Are there sightings data for killer whales off Cape Hatteras that
can be
referenced here to help explain the diel difference found in this study?
There are no published sightings but there is considerable local environmental
knowledge (including video footage) of killer whale occurrence in this area,
especially during winter.
Page 7 Line 48 – Page 8 Line 6: I found this section weak in content and poorly
written, e.g.,
there aren’t “many” prior studies using short-term tags. It could be rewritten more
succinctly and needs additional references added. I think that the combination of
behavioral data from short-term, high resolution tags with long-term tags is ideal.
Each has
its own strengths. Also, it is probably clearer to use suction-cup/Dtags and LIMPET
tags
rather than short and long term because some of the LIMPET deployments are
actually
short-term.
We agree and have rewritten the paragraph and added references, and direct the
reader to the revised manuscript for those edits.
Page 8 Line 2: I think you mean that not all individuals were fully sampled. Also
adding the
use of a goniometer will aid in re-sighting the tagged whale to increase
opportunities for
photo-id and biopsy to confirm sex.
We have changed the wording as suggested. In later field seasons we have been
using a goniometer to resight tagged whales.
Also, I’d like to see some discussion about TagZc051. Why do you think it behaved
differently?
We thank the reviewer for this observation and agree that it would be interesting to
address the behavioral differences for ZcTag051. However, addressing individual
level variation is beyond the scope of this manuscript. In fact, we are preparing a
separate manuscript using data from these tags as well as additional deployments
(in which tags were programmed in a different way making it difficult or impossible
to include them in this analysis).
Page 8 Lines 14-16: I would reword to say it is likely that Cuvier’s are at least
occasionally
diving…
Thank you, we have made this edit.
Table 3. Add max for the shallow dive depths and durations.
We have made this edit.
Table 7. Define “Surface” again here in the legend.
We have added “Deep dives are greater than 800 m, shallow dives are to depths of
50-800 m and surface intervals are between dives of 50 or more m.” to the caption.
Reviewer 2:
Comments to the Author(s)
This paper clearly and concisely summarizes the diving behavior of Cuvier’s beaked
whales tagged off Cape Hatteras. The methods and results are easy to follow, and
the discussion clearly follows from the data presented. There are a few places that
could benefit from clarification or re-wording, and a few places where I believe
references need to be added, but these are all minor changes.
We are grateful to this reviewer for her/his detailed and helpful comments. We
have made edits in the text where rewording and clarification were requested, and
we address specific comments and questions raised by this reviewer here.
Page 2, line 43: The Wildlife Computers LIMPET tag used in this study is now
officially referred to by the manufacturer as the “SPLASH10-292”

q5nmP79T2I82B4Ffi5w&e=). Suggest fixing throughout.
We have updated the text throughout the paper.
Page 2, line 47. Stating tags are ‘designed to operate up to 1000 or 2000m’ suggests
that they won’t work beyond that point. Suggest clarifying that tags are calibrated
to X meters with the corresponding manufacturer stated resolution, and clarify a
pressure transducer that is designed not to exceed 3,000m.
We agree with the reviewer. We have edited this to read: “Nine tags were in an
extended depth configuration (calibrated to 2000 m with a 1 m resolution, with a
pressure sensor designed not to exceed 3000 m). Two additional tags (ZcTag046 and
ZcTag047) were in a standard depth configuration (calibrated to 1000 m with a 0.5
m resolution, with a pressure sensor designed to survive depths of 2000 m).”
Of the two tags that were in standard depth configuration, ZcTag047 failed and data
from this tag was not used in the analysis. ZcTag046 did not dive beyond 2000 m,
allowing us to retain these data in our analysis despite the shallower configuration.
Page 3 line 10: Argos is not an acronym, only the first letter should be capitalized.
Fix throughout.
We have corrected this error.
Page 3, line 44: You should reference testing these transducers to 3000m, e.g.
Wildlife Computers or Schorr et al. (2014). This could help with the previous
comment about tags functioning beyond their ‘rated’ depth.
We have added the appropriate reference to Schorr et al. 2014.
Page 3, Line 52: The results (e.g. Page 5, line 46 and figure 4) suggest substantial
variability between individual, with the range of individual median dive depths
spanning almost 600m. In the discussion, individual variability is also highlighted.
Based on this, why did you choose to pool your data in order to determine the deep
vs shallow dive cutoff? The cutoff applied to one individual with a more limited
sample could be substantially biased if it was influenced by a large number of data
points from another animal behaving very differently. The scatter plot in figure 2
does not easily allow a reader to assess the degree to which individual data might
be influencing pooled metrics, given the overall number of data points displayed. A
hard cutoff doesn’t deal well with the tails in the distribution of deep and shallow
dives per individual (Figures 4 &5). While there is likely only a fraction of dives that
may be classified differently, given the emphasis on individual variability in the
discussion, the authors should better qualify why/how pooling data for this
important cutoff was chosen.
We agree with the reviewer that the pooled scatter plot in Figure 2 does not allow
the reader to assess the effect of individual data. To remedy this, we have included
a figure in the supplementary materials showing separate scatter plots for each
individual and we direct interested readers to this figure. This figure indicates that
there is little effect of individual behavior on the 800 m cutoff. It is possible that
some points in the tails of the distributions will be miscalculated by using a single
cutoff number, but it is such a small fraction of the overall number of dives that it
will not affect population level statistics. Several other studies of Ziphius dive
behavior utilize a hard cutoff (Tyack et al. 2006, Joyce et al. 2017, Baird et al. 2006,
2008, 2019).
Page 5, line 60. Having referenced the term ‘extreme’ to previously describe beaked
whale behavior, I understand the point- particularly with respect to other species.
However, stating that their diving is both extreme and habitual in the same
sentence seems a contradiction of terms. At this stage in our understanding of
beaked whale diving, the data convincingly suggest that diving to depths greater
than 1500m is routine for this species, so I would suggest moving away from
representing ‘habitual’ behavior of beaked whales as extreme behavior.
This is a fair comment, and we agree with the reviewer that it is contradictory to
state that their diving is both extreme and habitual. We would have changed the
wording here to state that these dives are extreme by other mammalian standards
but are habitual for Ziphius. However, at the suggestion of Reviewer 1, we have
removed this and the subsequent paragraph from the manuscript, as they do not
present any new findings. We have edited the text later in the discussion to clarify
this wording.
Page 6, Line 17-24. This section is a bit hard to follow and understand. Overall, the
paragraph reads as if focused on deep dive interval (IDDI) as a function of recovery
time. The third sentence states that pilot whales average 8-12 minutes between
foraging dives (i.e. a short IDDI) but then states that pilot whales spend long periods
near the surface between foraging dives. That time should be included in the IDDI,
so if that is 8-12 minutes, pilot whales would appear to spend (proportionately)
much more time on deep foraging dives, not “a comparable amount over an entire
diel cycle”. Ultimately, this section seems to confound IDDI, foraging rates, surface
intervals (as defined by tags in this study), and time near the surface (as referenced
for other species) across species, and could stand to be rewritten to clarify the
underlying point.
We agree with the reviewer that this paragraph was unwieldy and could have used
clarification. Given this comment and the suggestion of Reviewer 1, we have
removed this paragraph from the manuscript (see previous comment).
Page 6, line 60 to page 7 line 6. This section should reference Schorr et al. (2014),
Tyack et al. (2015) and Schorr et al. (2015), all of which explore this point in detail
for Cuvier’s beaked whales.

versus long datasets. Also, suggest changing the word from ‘Our study INDICATES…’
to ‘Our study CONFIRMS…’ since you reference a previous study having described
this.
We have added those references and changed the wording of that sentence. In
addition, Reviewer 1 requested that that paragraph be re-written, and we direct the
reviewer to the text for those edits.
Page 8, line 20-23: In addition to this unpublished manuscript, it seems like you
should also reference a paper demonstrating how data gaps can be reduced by
utilizing receivers other than just those on orbiting satellites. Suggest adding after
“…incomplete tag records…“ ‘unless shore-based receivers are utilized (Jeanniard-
du-Dot et al., 2017)’, or similar. Also, if the journal has issues with references that
can’t be accessed in any way at the time of publication, in addition to the
unpublished manuscript you might also reference a gray literature article dealing
specifically with this issue.
Thank you for this suggestion. We have added the sentence “…incomplete tag
records. In areas where animal occur close to land, shore-based receivers can
improve data retrieval (Jeanniard-du-Dot et al. 2017).” As a side note, we would like
to be able to use shore-based receivers to reduce these data gaps but,
unfortunately, the topography of our study area makes this impossible.
We prefer to retain the Quick et al. reference as it addresses the same type of tag
(whereas the Schorr et al. 2017 gray article discusses a Fastloc GPS tag) and study
location. Since the time of original submission of this article, the Quick et al. paper
has been accepted for publication in Animal Biotelemetry and will therefore be
listed as ‘in press’.

Page 8 line 24: I agree that sensor issues have not always been addressed in detail in
previous peer-reviewed literature, and I commend the authors for more fully
discussing this issue and how it was dealt with. However in regards to data gaps and
other limitations of the tags not having been acknowledged, several studies on
beaked whales using LIMPET tags referenced in your paper have
acknowledged/addressed at least some of the limitations of these tags (e.g. the
presence and influence of data gaps, the limitations of summarized data, etc.), at
least to some degree (see Schorr et al., 2014 & 2015, Joyce et al. 2016, Jeanniard-
du-Dot et al., 2017). This statement should identify specific data issues that have
not been adequately addressed, and/or these references should be added.
Thank you, we have added these references.
Page 8 line 27: Clarify how your data identifies the need for tags to transmit data
“more quickly”, since this doesn’t seem clear from the above. Is this need based on
Argos message length or size (e.g. faster transmission would allow for transmission
of longer or larger messages)? Also, stating there is a need for tags capable of
“handling the extraordinary diving capabilities” suggests that the tags you and
previous authors are using are not. As this is the final sentence of the discussion, it
should be more clearly supported by the data discussed above.
We have replaced this sentence with the following: “Our analysis of the errors
associated with these tags has indicated several areas where satellite tags could be
improved. Given the extraordinary diving capabilities of these animals, there is a
need to develop tags with sensors that are calibrated and rated to survive the
extreme depths that these animals are capable of diving. To avoid losing
information to data gaps from messages not fully transmitting at the surface, there
is also a need for the tags to be able to contact a satellite and push their messages
through more quickly to account for the short surface durations of these animals.
Developing tags with these capabilities will greatly improve our knowledge of the
world’s deepest mammalian divers.”
The main issue we have had to deal with, other than apparent pressure sensor
failures, has been the existence of numerous gaps in the data record from each
tagged whale. Given the very short surface durations of these beaked whales, we
cannot push longer or larger messages, but we could reduce these gaps if there was
a quicker connection and transmission time at each surfacing.
We don’t intend to suggest that tags that we or previous authors have used have
inaccurately described the behavior of beaked whales, but we do believe that
current tags are not ideally suited to studying beaked whales. A tag specifically
designed for beaked whales would allow for a full representation of their behavior,
including possibly very deep (>3,000 m) dives, while maximizing the data returned
from each tag, and with fewer tag failures.
Page 8 line 42. Following the previous comment, again what exactly is meant by
‘…develop tags capable of accurately measuring behavior at the extreme depths at
which these animals forage’? Are you referring only to the need for a LIMPET tag
with a deeper rated pressure sensor? Suggest re-wording this sentence since you
describe all of the deep dives in your dataset as extreme, so this could be read to
suggest that the tag used here (or any other tag currently available) is not capable of
‘accurately’ measuring behavior.
We agree that this wording was problematic. We have changed that sentence to
read: “Finally, there is a need for beaked whale-specific tags that are calibrated to
the remarkable depths at which these animals routinely dive.”
Page 22, line 30. You state the 800 m cutoff has been used “previously” to segregate
deep and shallow dives classes, but this does not appear to be referenced elsewhere
in the manuscript. See also previous comment about using this cutoff limit. Please
add a reference or clarify.
We thank the reviewer for this catch and have added the appropriate references
(Baird et al. 2006, 2008).
