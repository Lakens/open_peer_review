In this work, the nitrogen and phosphorous contents in waters from the tributaries of the
Danjiangkou Reservoir were investigated in order to evaluate the water quality supply. The
manuscript is well presented and In my opinion suitable for publication after considering the
following minimal points.
- Please, check some symbols not readable (e.g., in Table 1; line 3, page 2; line 50, page 2).
- It seems that the sampling point “R4” is not coded in the Figure 1.
- In the discussion, a comparison between the data obtained and previous reported works can be
interesting. Were the correlations observed in agreement with reported works?
- Were the samples filtered and acidified after one week of the sample collection? (section 2.1 and
2.2). Is there no microbiological activity and/or absorption/desorption processes due to the
presence of suspended particulate matter during this time?
- Please, re-phrase lines 30 and 39 (page 3) about the description of the parameters used in the
equations, e.g. Q is discharge, C is the average annual content…
- The study was performed in normal, flood and dry seasons. It should be interesting to include
data of discharges during these periods. Was it considered in the standardization for further
statistical analysis?
- Related with the previous point, a brief description of the different tributaries
characteristics/remarks can be useful.
- Table 4, please check the number of significant digits

where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Best wishes,

Appendix A
Dear editor,
Thanks for the valuable comments on the manuscript. We have carefully
considered all advice and suggestions, and addressed all raised concerns. The
point-by-point responses to the reviewers' comments are attached bellow.
Sincerely,
Binghui Zheng
Point-by-point response to comments
Reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer #1:
1) Please, check some symbols not readable (e.g., in Table 1; line 3, page 2; line 50,
page 2).
Response: Thanks for the advice. The abbreviations in table 1 are explained in Section
2.1 on page 3. The unreadable symbols in line 58 page 2 and line 67 page 3 (in
line 3, page 2 and line 50, page 2 in the original manuscript) have been revised.
2) It seems that the sampling point “R4” is not coded in the Figure 1.
Response: Thank you for the reminder. The sampling point “R4” has been coded in
Fig.1 in the revision.
3) In the discussion, a comparison between the data obtained and previous reported
works can be interesting. Were the correlations observed in agreement with reported
works?
Response: Thank you for the comment. Yes, the correlations observed in our study
were in agreement with previous reported works. For example, according to the
data obtained in our study in section 3.1.4, Shendinghe is more polluted than
other tributaries because it flows through the Shiyan City and receives a lot of
municipal sewage, which also reported by other researchers (Reference [23] and
[24]).
4) Were the samples filtered and acidified after one week of the sample collection?
(section 2.1 and 2.2). Is there no microbiological activity and/or absorption/desorption
processes due to the presence of suspended particulate matter during this time?
Response: Thank you for the comment. All the samples are pretreated immediately by
filtration or acidification to inhibit the microbiological activity and physical or
chemical reaction before measurement. More details about samples collection
and pretreatment are given in section 2.1 and 2.2 in the revision.
5) Please, re-phrase lines 30 and 39 (page 3) about the description of the parameters
used in the equations, e.g. Q is discharge, C is the average annual content…
Response: Thanks. The description of the parameters used in the equations in line
95-96 and line 101-103 on page 4 (in Lines 30 and 39, page 3 in the original
manuscript) has been rephrased in the revision.
6) The study was performed in normal, flood and dry seasons. It should be interesting
to include data of discharges during these periods. Was it considered in the
standardization for further statistical analysis?
Response: Thank you for the comment. It would be better if the discharge data of
every tributary in different seasons could be used for statistical analysis.
However, due to the inaccessibility of data, only the annual average inputs of TN
and TP from tributaries were estimated in this study.
7) Related with the previous point, a brief description of the different tributaries
characteristics/remarks can be useful.
Response: Thank you for the advice. The brief introduction on the characteristics of
the different tributaries was added in Section 3.2 in the revision.
8) Table 4, please check the number of significant digits
Response: Thanks. The number of significant digits was checked and revised in Table
4 in the revision.
Reviewer#2:
1) In Abstract all the abbreviations must be explained first.
Response: Thanks. All the abbreviations in Abstract had been explained at their first
use.
