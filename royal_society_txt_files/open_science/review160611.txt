Congratulations to the authors. The data you’ve presented are needed to enhance our
understanding of the behavioral ecology of this species, assess its vulnerability to threats such as
pelagic long-line fisheries, and provide an aid to future conservation initiatives. This manuscript
is generally well-constructed and reasonably well-written, but still requires some work to

In ‘Horizontal and vertical movements of Caribbean reefsharks (Carcharhinus perezi):
Conservation implications of limited migration in a marine sanctuary’ by Oliver N Shipley, Lucy
A. Howey, Emily R. Tolentino, Lance K. B., Jordan, Jonathan L. W. Ruppert and Edward J. Brook,
the authors tag Carribean Reef sharks in the Bahamas and analyze the horizontal and vertical
movements of these animals using satellite tags. The authors find these animals don’t move far
from their tagging locations. Also, they determine 3 broad categories of depth distribution
(behavior) when animals leave the shelf areas.
Though I appreciate the time and effort to collect and analyze these data, the rationale for this
study and novelty seem to have eluded me. The authors conducted some interesting analyses,
however the importance of these data were not clear- especially in light of older studies about C
perezi suggesting limited range and vertical movements and implications for MPAs (i.e.,
Chapman 2007). So I’m not sure why they need to be studied again here in the Bahamas. this
simply seems like a descriptive paper, which was the norm when tagging technology was novel,
3
and has already been covered for this species. There's no hypothesis testing etc, which would add
context to this study. Please develop the specific reasoning. Or state that this is the same study
but at a different location, and why that is important or why we would expect it would be
different.
Also, the introduction presents information about EEZs and the Bahamas, but does not justify
why information about vertical or horizontal movements add anything to this discussion or are
necessary here.
I don’t see any major errors in the analysis techniques, the justification and impact of the study
need significant improvement.
Line 3: Remove comma in Lance Jordan’s name on cover page
Line 49: I suggest authors change to ‘greater’
Lines 64-84: I think there is too much background here. The information seems to drag on a bit, I
would suggest cutting this down and streamlining to only the most relevant information.
Lin 84-90: I don’t see the connection to the background in the introduction to the study. Why is
vertical and horizontal movement important to the Bahamas? It’s poorly understood in
Bahamian waters, but a lot is known about their movements in general at other locations. There is
no justification why you can just apply that info here. Why do an entirely new study?
Is this study actually important to the Bahamas or just a descriptive study of their movement
(which has largely been done)?
Line 89: What do animal vertical movements have to do with the efficacy of the EEZ on their
conservation?
Line 214: 71.6km is well within the 200NM EEZ, so why is this important at all in reference to the
reasoning introduction?
Lines 244/252: I am curious why more deep dives occur in the winter, but the average depth is
shallower in the winter? Is that an error or is there an explanation for that?

Line 49 – A reference is needed for this statement.
Line 62 – As an official IUCN status, shouldn’t ‘near threatened’ be capitalized?
Lines 75-77 – This statement is about legislation from 2011 that protects sharks in The Bahamas.
But one of the references for this statement [24] is for a 2005 publication. I question whether
either of these two references are appropriate (as opposed to perhaps a footnote for the Bahamian
declaration itself). Please address this.
Line 79 – Banned where since 1993? It is not clear if we’re talking about The Bahamas here. The
two mid-sentence references are about stress. Therefore a reference is needed to support the
statement about longlining being banned since 1993.
Line 216 – When citing a figure, comply with the journal’s format and be consistent (i.e. Figure or
Fig.).
Line 226 – So the light-based tools used (X-Tags) did not provide the geographic resolution
needed to gain insight into the small scale migrations that Caribbean reef sharks are known to be
limited to. Then why was this tool chosen to address the question of movements of reef sharks
with respect to the Bahamian EEZ? We know that light-based methods of fish tracking (i.e.
PSATs) are useful when the animals are making broad ocean scale movements. Rather than
glossing over this in the paper, I think the authors need to clearly discuss the limitations of their
results given the type of tags they chose to use and perhaps allude to alternative approaches that
might provide better results.
Line 205 – Missing comma in 1035.

I apologize to the authors as only part of my initial comments seemed to have been included in
the first review. The context of my comments were unfortunately absent.
However, the authors addressed the majority of my comments satisfactorily.
My last comment is regarding the use of these data for MPAs. The authors suggest that these
data indicate the MPA is useful for CRS as it protects them in Bahamanian waters 'In conclusion,
the limited movements of Caribbean reef sharks suggests reduced interactions of this sub-
population with extrinsic fishing pressure, possibly sustaining ecological and economic vitality in
The Bahamas.' I would like to see the authors discuss the flip side of this information- that the
MPA in the bahamas therefore will likely not help any other sub-population of CRS outside of the
Bahamas. These data suggest that populations are discrete and a Bahamanian MPA cannot act as
a source for other deleted populations regionally. We often talk about spill-over as being a
benefit of MPAs, but obvious isn't in this case. I'd like to authors to atleast address this in the
discussion.

rizontal and vertical movements of Caribbean reef sharks (Carcharhinus perezi):
nservation implications of limited migration in a marine sanctuary."
mments to Authors:
ngratulations to the authors. The data you’ve presented are needed to enhance our
erstanding of the behavioral ecology of this species, assess its vulnerability to threats such
pelagic long-line fisheries, and provide an aid to future conservation initiatives. This
nuscript is generally well-constructed and reasonably well-written, but still requires some
k to improve overall readability, clarity, and the interpretation of results. In an attached file, I
e provided some general recommendations as well as detailed line-by-line edits.
neral Recommendations:
a few instances, there are long run-on sentences. For better clarity, try to economize on
ds and if necessary, divide into two sentences (examples are noted under Specific
commendations).
hink it would be simpler and clearer to identify each shark/tag by using a series of sequential
mbers (e.g. Shark 1, Shark 2 etc.) rather than utilizing the 5 or 6 digit Agros PTT number.
s is just a suggestion.
significant part of the paper’s main conclusions are related to foraging. But in my opinion,
authors have done an inadequate job of digging into the literature to better establish the diet
his shark species in order to support their hypotheses. Without this support, I feel their
clusions are too speculative.
hen attempting to interpret their results, I would like to see the authors explore (and offer)
e alternative explanations.
he table and figure headings are generally not descriptive enough. They should be able to
nd alone and provide enough for the reader to understand the main idea of the figure/table.
example, none of the headings tell the reader what species we’re dealing with.
ecific Recommendations:
stract
e 32 – Should make it clear that you’re talking about depth here. Perhaps modify with “down
depth of 436.1 m”.
oduction
e 40 – Specify what measurement this is (e.g. TL).
e 44 – Insert space after 200.
es 46-48 – Does the prevalence of Caribbean reef sharks really “mean” this? Please clarify
/or back this up with a reference.
es 56-60 – This is a very long run-on sentence that needs to be modified for clarity.
e 61 – Should be “the Caribbean reef shark”.
e 66 – Multi reference citations are not punctuated consistently. Line 46 uses commas
ween them. This line does not.
e 75 – Use the EEZ abbreviation.
e 79 – End sentence with “regions”. Start new sentence with “For example, …”
e 80 – Rather than “one”, should this not say “an order of” in reference to magnitude?
es 87-90 – Please economize on words here or divide this into two sentences.
thods
e 112 – Add the word “first” if referring to the first dorsal fin. I further ask that further detail be
ed on how the hole was made in that fin in order to pass the monofilament bridle through.
e 172 – The word “familywise” should be “family-wise”.
sults
es 204-206 – This seems like interpretation of the data and therefore should be in the
cussion.

Response to reviewers
Reviewer 1
Comments to Authors:
Congratulations to the authors. The data you’ve presented are needed to enhance our
understanding of the behavioral ecology of this species, assess its vulnerability to
threats such as pelagic long-line fisheries, and provide an aid to future conservation
initiatives. This manuscript is generally well-constructed and reasonably well-written,
but still requires some work to improve overall readability, clarity, and the
interpretation of results. In an attached file, I have provided some general
recommendations as well as detailed line-by-line edits.
General Recommendations:
In a few instances, there are long run-on sentences. For better clarity, try to
economize on words and if necessary, divide into two sentences (examples are noted
under Specific Recommendations).
We have improved the clarity of expression outlined in the specific recommendations.
- I think it would be simpler and clearer to identify each shark/tag by using a
series of sequential numbers (e.g. Shark 1, Shark 2 etc.) rather than utilizing
the 5 or 6 digit Agros PTT number.
We find it clearer for the authors to refer to each shark by the PSAT ID. This has been
the convention in many other articles citied in this paper. Additionally, this
convention allows for consistency across studies if these individual datasets are
incorporated into other future studies and publications.
This is just a suggestion.
A significant part of the paper’s main conclusions are related to foraging. But in my
opinion, the authors have done an inadequate job of digging into the literature to
better establish the diet of this shark species in order to support their hypotheses.
Without this support, I feel their conclusions are too speculative.
We provide further evidence from Motta et al. (1999) and Tavares et al. (2009)
suggesting this species has a broad diet range which encompasses prey items found on
neritic and mesophotic reefs, as well as deeper mesopelagic/bathyal habitats.
However, there is little diet information for Caribbean reef sharks in this specific
study locale.
When attempting to interpret their results, I would like to see the authors explore (and
offer) some alternative explanations.
We cite alternative explanations for these behaviors; however there is a significant
amount of evidence illustrating the use of deeper habitats as prey pools for coastal
requiem sharks. We therefore discuss this in much greater detail as we believe it to be
suggest the vertical movements of Caribbean reef sharks are associated with any other
possible hypotheses, in-part due to the lack of life-history data on this species.
-The table and figure headings are generally not descriptive enough. They should be
able to stand alone and provide enough for the reader to understand the main idea of
the figure/table. For example, none of the headings tell the reader what species we’re
dealing with.
We have added the name of this species to every table and figure caption as well as
provided more details in figure and table legends.
Specific Recommendations:
Abstract
Line 32 – Should make it clear that you’re talking about depth here. Perhaps modify
with “down to a depth of 436.1 m”.
Changed and now reads ‘down to a depth of 436.1 m’
Introduction
Line 40 – Specify what measurement this is (e.g. TL).
Changed to ‘maximum total length 295 cm’
Line 44 – Insert space after 200.
Changed
Lines 46-48 – Does the prevalence of Caribbean reef sharks really “mean” this?
Please clarify and/or back this up with a reference.
We have changed the sentence structure and removed confusing term; it now reads
‘Caribbean reef sharks are considered one of the major top-predators on coral reefs
throughout the Caribbean, and are pivotal to the health, and subsequent resources
provided by these ecosystems
Lines 56-60 – This is a very long run-on sentence that needs to be modified for
clarity.
We have split this into two sentences and improved clarify of expression. The
sentences now read as follows ‘Although Caribbean reef sharks show high relative
abundance compared to other predators across their range [10], artisanal [11]
and commercial fishing [12] as well as coastal development [11] [13] threaten
their populations. This is likely exacerbated by their tendency to move across
relatively large spatial scales through a multitude of ecosystems including
coastal reefs, open-ocean and deep-water habitats (> 200 m) [4].’
Line 61 – Should be “the Caribbean reef shark”.
Changed
Line 66 – Multi reference citations are not punctuated consistently. Line 46 uses
commas between them. This line does not.
We have removed all commas between multi reference citations throughout the
manuscript for consistency.
Line 75 – Use the EEZ abbreviation.
This does not follow proper grammar, on its first use; the full term should be used
prior to abbreviation. We therefore have not changed this.
Line 79 – End sentence with “regions”. Start new sentence with “For example, …”
Changed.
magnitude?
Changed
Lines 87-90 – Please economize on words here or divide this into two sentences.
We have removed words, this sentence now reads ‘Therefore, we used pop-up
satellite archival tags (PSATs), which have proven valuable in assessing shark
movements [29] [30] [31] [21], to examine horizontal and vertical movements
exhibited by Caribbean reef sharks in The Bahamas.’
Methods
Line 112 – Add the word “first” if referring to the first dorsal fin. I further ask that
further detail be added on how the hole was made in that fin in order to pass the
monofilament bridle through.
We have added this section, which reads ‘A small pilot hole was made through the
leading edge of the dorsal fin using a sterile, stainless steel scalpel prior to tag
attachment.’
Line 172 – The word “familywise” should be “family-wise”.
Changed.
Results
Lines 204-206 – This seems like interpretation of the data and therefore should be in
the Discussion.
We have removed this sentence from the results.
Line 214 – This is not worded clearly as you’re talking about multiple tags/positions.
I would suggest, “The initial Argos-estimated positions…”
Changed.
Lines 217/221 – There seems to be inconsistencies with how numbers are written.
Numbers less than 10 are spelled out here. But in other cases they are written as
numbers (e.g. Line122).
Numbers of ten and below, which do not have specific units, are written as words, all
others are now numbers. This is consistent throughout the manuscript.
Line 219-220 – This is indicating that wind would be the prevailing factor in the
movement of detached tags. But wouldn’t the drift of these small, relatively low
profile tags not be more prone to the effects of prevailing water currents?
We have changed the terminology so this now reads ‘up-current’.
Line 255 – Inconsistent use of commas for thousands separator. No commas used in
other 4 digit numbers (e.g. Line 96). But were used for 6 digit numbers (e.g. Line
207).
All four-digit numbers now have consistent use of commas throughout.
Line 261 – The dive itself is not “V-shaped”. Rather it’s the time-depth profile of the
dive.
Please clarify.
We have changed expression and improved clarity, this now reads ‘Dive switch count
only contained one change in direction (switch count = 1), such that the time-depth
profile appeared as a ‘V-shaped’ dive.
Lines 291-294 – The word “suggest” comes up twice in this sentence. As the reader, I
don’t sense/gain a lot of confidence in what is being reported here. Caution should be
taken in drawing too far a conclusion from this unpublished genetic study. Also, this
Ph.D. Dissertation is from 2014 and not 2013 (according to the NSU website).
We have removed this sentence and reference from our manuscript.
Line 303 – Perhaps replace “indicate and drive” with something like “identify and
facilitate”.
Changed to ‘identify and facilitate’.
Line 315 – Rather than “presents”, probably intended “represents”.
Changed presents to ‘indicates’ as to avoid the double-use of ‘represents’ in this
sentence.
Line 320 – The word “Annually” is not appropriate here. Perhaps “seasonally” would
be better.
Changed to ‘seasonally’.
Line 323/324 – This statement should be supported with more or better references.
This lone tiger shark reference isn’t enough. Is there nothing available for C. perezi to
support this? If not, then perhaps provide some evidence that other more comparable
reef shark species exhibit this behavior.
We have replaced this reference with a new review paper by Hammerschlag et al. (In
Press), which focuses specifically on the nocturnal behaviours of elasmobranchs,
including foraging.
Line 325/326 – You’re hypothesizing that the vertical excursions of C. perezi are to
exploit vertically migrating prey. But you haven’t established anything about the diet
of this shark species at this point. Citing this squid reference [60] is only meaningful
if you have some evidence that Caribbean reef sharks actually feed on squid.
Otherwise its total speculation and does not belong in the paper.
We now mention the broad diet of this species. We also propose foraging on
mesophotic reefs and draw on work from similar taxa to support this statement (e.g.
Papastamatiou et al. 2014). We keep the potential prey items broad, as we agree that
we cannot determine the specific species, on which Caribbean reef sharks are foraging
in this study.
Lines 329-331 – This is not the only possible explanation for these
observations….especially given the relatively low sample size and short duration of
many tracks. Alternative explanations should be explored and offered in the
discussion
We feel there is significant evidence across the literature to suggest these directed
movements pertain largely to foraging. However, we have added other potential
solutions for this behavior (lines 329 – 333). Studies on the movement and dietary
composition of other reef sharks (McCauley et al., 2012; Papastamatiou et al., 2014)
show a significant contribution of epi- and mesopelagic prey items to the diets of
coastal requiem sharks (Carcharhinus spp.). Therefore, we feel this is the most
states ‘short duration of many tracks’; however we have a number of longer term
tracks (>30 days) so that we were able to make inferences as to why foraging
strategies (depth use) may change by season – i.e. deepening of the mixed layer.
Line 335 – Replace “indicating” with “indicate”.
Changed
Line 343 – Space needed after 100.
Changed
Line 344 – A reference to the diet of C. perezi is provided here. But it would be useful
to know if the cephalopods reported were squid (as per comments from Lines
325/326). We are unsure whether the cephalopods reported were in-fact squid.
Therefore, we suggest movements may pertain to foraging on mesophotic reefs as
well as diel-vertically migrating prey items.
Also see Tavares (2009) for more diet info for this species.
We have used this reference to illustrate foraging on mesophotic coral reefs.
Lines 347/348 – The genus Carcharhinus has appeared earlier…hence these sci.
names can be abbreviated to C. amblyrhynchos and C. melanopterus.
Changed.
Line 356 – Instead of always referring to the species as the ‘Caribbean reef shark’, I
would suggest occasionally substituting it with C. perezi to avoid repetition.
We don’t agree with switching between the two, as this may confuse the reader; we
therefore keep the consistent use of ‘Caribbean reef shark’.
Lines 357-359 – One of the main conclusions of your paper hinges on foraging
behavior, but you have not dug deep enough into what is known about the diet of C.
perezi to draw these conclusions.
We do not stress that movements are solely associated with foraging. Our conclusions
are short and concise and simply mention that movements may correspond to
foraging on deeper prey pools. We draw conclusions from studies relating to similar
taxa (e.g. Papistamatiou et al. 2014) suggesting coastal requiem sharks feed on deeper
mesophotic reefs, as well as deeper mesopelagic/bathypelagic prey items during the
night. The broad diet-type of this species, as referenced in the discussion, suggests
that cephalopods and other pelagic fishes, known to perform diel-vertical movements
could serve as important prey for these species. We do not discount other potential
hypotheses (lines 239 – 333) however due to the ambiguity and lack of evidence
(especially within Carcharhinids) associated with these hypotheses, they are not
discussed further.

Figures
Fig. 1 – In the caption, should specify “first” dorsal fin. And for clarity, could also
mention that yellow conventional tags can be seen in the photo.
Changed and now reads ‘X-Tag attachment through the leading (anterior) edge of the
first dorsal fin. Conventional, yellow steel headed dart tag is also visible’.
Fig. 2. I do not find this a very effective figure in its present form. The caption
indicates that all start and end points are connected by a line. But it’s just the 7-day
drift tags that have this line. I would suggest a more zoomed-in version that has the
start and end points for individual sharks connected. A scale bar in km is also needed.
The figure legend has been clarified and a distance scale bar has been added.
However, we wanted the figure to be zoomed-out enough to display the surrounding
study area, particularly, since the horizontal tracks of the sharks could not be
resolved. Further, all start and end point pairs are actually connected with a straight
line; however, most of the tags reported close to the tagging sites so that the straight
lines could not be resolved (this is now noted in the figure legend). The displacement
lines are only noticeable in the cases such that the tag drifted for seven days.
Consequently, this figure illustrates the lack of confirmed net movement in all tracked
sharks.
Fig. 3. The caption should be more explanatory. The x-axis should be labeled (Date).
This caption has been extended to better describe the figure.
Reviewer 2
Line 3: Remove comma in Lance Jordan’s name on cover page
Change.
Line 49: I suggest authors change to ‘greater’
Now reads ‘greater Caribbean’.
Lines 64-84: I think there is too much background here. The information seems to
drag on a bit, I would suggest cutting this down and streamlining to only the most
relevant information.
In a study that is focusing on a single species, we feel it pertinent to provide a
thorough background as to why this study is necessary, as well as a brief history on
the conservation status of the study species. We therefore feel this paragraph provides
important background as to why the study of Caribbean reef sharks is necessary.
Lin 84-90: I don’t see the connection to the background in the introduction to the
study. Why is vertical and horizontal movement important to the Bahamas? It’s
poorly understood in Bahamian waters, but a lot is known about their movements in
general at other locations. There is no justification why you can just apply that info
here. Why do an entirely new study?
We do not understand this statement. Firstly, we stress the importance of quantifying
horizontal movements with regards to the efficacy of the Bahamian MPA in
protecting highly mobile shark populations. In text examples include the statement
‘The Bahamas, therefore, offers a unique opportunity to quantify the movements and
interactions of an apex predatory shark which reside fully, or for part of its life-
Secondly, we disagree that ‘a lot’ is known about the movements of this species in
general. The reviewer is supposedly basing this point on the small collection of
tracking studies (primarily acoustic), which have extremely limited spatial limitations.
For example, the Chapman et al. (2007) study, used PSAT’s to study the long-term
movements of this species on Glovers reef atoll, Belize, and is currently the only
study to track this species over larger spatial scales. However, this study was
conducted on an isolated atoll, with tracking periods between 7 and 20 days.
Therefore, the suggestion that we could simply apply this tracking data to species that
reside at a completely different locale, with a different mosaic of habitats, could be
erroneous. In addition, Chapman et al. (2007) did not provide any long-term tracking
data for this species, again stressing the novelty and importance of the data presented
in this manuscript (tracking days ranging from 30–243 days).
Is this study actually important to the Bahamas or just a descriptive study of their
movement (which has largely been done)?
We disagree with the reviewer that a study describing Caribbean reef shark movement
has ‘largely been done’, and we find this comment surprising if the reviewer is
familiar with Chapman, Pikitch and Brooks et al. papers. Movement data for this
species is limited, especially within the greater Caribbean. We stress in multiple
sections of the introduction and discussion that Caribbean reef sharks constitute the
most commonly seen shark on tourism dives and therefore are responsible for
significant economic income to the Bahamas. The tagged sub-population of
Caribbean reef sharks did not move beyond the Bahamian EEZ suggesting that their
populations are likely to be sustained, which, in turn, sustains dive tourism operations.
We make this point clear in the discussion and in the introduction with the statement
‘In addition to their ecological role as top predators, common sightings on
recreational shark dives, especially within the great Caribbean, creates a significant
economic reliance upon healthy Caribbean reef shark populations [8].’
Line 89: What do animal vertical movements have to do with the efficacy of the EEZ
on their conservation?
Assessing the vertical movements of animals increases our knowledge as to their
ecological role as vectors of ecosystem connectivity between multiple ecosystems.
This again, stresses the need to maintain their populations, and thus quantify whether
they remain ‘protected’ during their life-history.
Line 214: 71.6km is well within the 200NM EEZ, so why is this important at all in
reference to the reasoning introduction?
This point confuses us. We are suggesting that Caribbean reef sharks, large mobile
predators, who have the potential to perform longer migrations outside of the
Bahamas EEZ, stay relatively resident. This is therefore important to their
conservation as they remain ‘protected’ throughout the year. Furthermore, the longest
prior track reported by Chapman et al. 2007 provided little information on long-term
movements.
Lines 244/252: I am curious why more deep dives occur in the winter, but the
average depth is shallower in the winter? Is that an error or is there an explanation for
that?
food-pulses to depths of diving. On average thermoregulation likely results in the
shallower depth preference during this time. However, as the text states, a larger
sample size is required to further assess these seasonal affects.
Line 255: There are typographical errors in this sentence. I don’t understand what
this sentence is saying. Please clarify.
We have removed errors and provided clarity; this sentence now reads ‘Individuals
with high-resolution datasets (n = 7) demonstrated 2,118 excursions below 50 m
indicating use of deeper habitats adjacent to the Great Bahamas Bank (Table 4).’

Comments to the Author(s)
Line 49 – A reference is needed for this statement.
We have cited the papers of Chapman et al. (2007) and Brooks et al. (2013) which
cover this topic well across the Caribbean.
Line 62 – As an official IUCN status, shouldn’t ‘near threatened’ be capitalized?
We have changed this to ‘Near Threatened’.
Lines 75-77 – This statement is about legislation from 2011 that protects sharks in
The Bahamas. But one of the references for this statement [24] is for a 2005
publication. I question whether either of these two references are appropriate (as
opposed to perhaps a footnote for the Bahamian declaration itself). Please address
this.
We disagree removing the citation of Howey-Jordan et al. (2013). This paper clearly
explains the implications of the Bahamian shark sanctuary for mobile oceanic
whitetip sharks. This paradigm is directly related to the point we are outlining here.
We add an additional reference by Hoyte (2014), which is a book chapter making
several references to the Bahamian shark sanctuary, and its associated benefits. We
have removed the 2005 reference.
Line 79 – Banned where since 1993? It is not clear if we’re talking about The
Bahamas here. The two mid-sentence references are about stress. Therefore a
reference is needed to support the statement about longlining being banned since
1993.
We have reworded this sentence, and aligned with the Howey et al. (2013) reference,
which states that longlining is banned in the Bahamas.
Line 216 – When citing a figure, comply with the journal’s format and be consistent
(i.e. Figure or Fig.).
All figures are now referred to as ‘Figure’ in-text.
Line 226 – So the light-based tools used (X-Tags) did not provide the geographic
resolution needed to gain insight into the small scale migrations that Caribbean reef
sharks are known to be limited to. Then why was this tool chosen to address the
question of movements of reef sharks with respect to the Bahamian EEZ? We know
that light-based methods of fish tracking (i.e. PSATs) are useful when the animals are
making broad ocean scale movements. Rather than glossing over this in the paper, I
think the authors need to clearly discuss the limitations of their results given the type
of tags they chose to use and perhaps allude to alternative approaches that might
provide better results.
As satellite-tracking data for Caribbean reef sharks is extremely limited, we did not
know whether individuals would make more extensive migrations than observed at
other locales. Therefore PSAT’s were an informed approach to test this hypothesis.
Caribbean reef sharks are commonly spotted off the coast of Florida, and it is well
movements to that of bull, tiger, and hammerhead sharks (See Graham et al., 2016).
We state that our observations remain inconclusive, and draw on prior knowledge e.g.
reproduction to offer possible solutions to why animals may move away from
Eleuthera. We have added a sentence indicating how alternative approaches can be
used to better inform finer-scale movements, in relation to specific locations with
associated citations: ‘Although light-based geolocation estimates proved somewhat
limited in their ability to discern finer-scale movements, in relation to the EEZ
boundary, this could be achieved in future studies through the use of passive
telemetry, or chemical tracer approaches such as stable isotope analysis.’
However, we do not feel it necessary to rigorously draw on limitations of geolocation,
as we do not go into detail, nor make extensive claims regarding the specific
horizontal movement of individual sharks.

Comments to the Author(s)
I apologize to the authors as only part of my initial comments seemed to have been
included in the first review. The context of my comments were unfortunately absent.
However, the authors addressed the majority of my comments satisfactorily.
My last comment is regarding the use of these data for MPAs. The authors suggest
that these data indicate the MPA is useful for CRS as it protects them in Bahamanian
waters 'In conclusion, the limited movements of Caribbean reef sharks suggests
reduced interactions of this sub-population with extrinsic fishing pressure, possibly
sustaining ecological and economic vitality in The Bahamas.' I would like to see the
authors discuss the flip side of this information- that the MPA in the bahamas
therefore will likely not help any other sub-population of CRS outside of the
Bahamas. These data suggest that populations are discrete and a Bahamanian MPA
cannot act as a source for other deleted populations regionally. We often talk about
spill-over as being a benefit of MPAs, but obvious isn't in this case. I'd like to authors
to atleast address this in the discussion.
We are not sure the reviewer has fully read through our discussion. We feel
this comment is addressed in lines 295 – 301, which reads: ‘However, the relatively
localised movements, if uniform across sub-populations, may have greater
implications for individuals in unprotected regions. For example, the bottom longline
fisheries of Columbia target Caribbean reef sharks for their skin, oil, and fins [2] and
may be contributing to significant population declines within unprotected sub-
populations. Although this was beyond the scope of this study, assessing Caribbean
appropriate management strategies within and between nations.’
