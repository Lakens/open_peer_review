The permeability and mechanical behavior of coal under the effect of gas and stress conditions
are important for the coal mining industry.
In this experimental study, some of the basic understandings of containing-gas raw coal are
promoted and the gas flow velocity evolution under different loading and unloading processes
are presented. The testing results are listed in the end of the manuscript and helpful to be
analyzed by other relevant researches.
However, there are still some parts should be revised.
1) The introduction should be shortened since the studies of different scholars may have the
similar works, which could be combined with each other.
2) In the chapter 2.1, the type of coal and the basic geological condition of the sampling place are
not shown.
3) Figure 1 needs to add reference information.
4) The rocks in coal mines are not used in the experiments. Therefore, the description of “the coal
and rock masses” may be changed as “the coal masses”.
5) According to Figure 8, the lowest gas flow rate is not corresponding to the highest stress, but
3
typically ahead of the peak stress point in each loading-unloading process, please explain the
reason.
6) Are the loading and unloading rates, which are not mentioned in the test procedure, affecting
the testing results?
7) The stress sensitivities of coal permeability under different loading-unloading cycles may
could be analyzed in the manuscript.
8) According to Figure 10, the power functions fit well with the testing results in the loading
sections, but not quite well in the unloading sections, please give the reason.
9) There are some English expression mistakes and typing errors, e.g. Page 3, Lines 125, 137-138;
Page 5, Line 188; Page 6, Lines 210, 239, Page 7, Line 255, etc. Please carefully edit for English by
asking for help from a native English speaker or by using an English editing service.

The paper deals with results from experiment using self-made "THM coupled with servo-
controlled seepage apparatus for containing- gas raw coal" carried out under the process of
loading and unloading compression test with different stress conditions, and deformations, the
strength of coal and properties of gas flow were studied. I believe that the paper are made could a
useful contribution to present knowledge regarding mechanical behavior on similar materials.
The following comments and suggestions and typographical writing errors were detected:
(1) Line 25: Change ". And" in ", and".
(2) Line 83: Change “investigate” in “investigated”.
(3) The current literature review is not sufficient. Please mention more current studies related to
the matter of the article in this paper.
(4) The Authors could clarify the choice to carry out loading and unloading compression tests on
coal. Is this choice related to the particular use of the material for a specific engineering structure.
(5) The testing apparatus could be described more accurately. For example to incorporating some
labels and identifications.

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript investigated an interesting topic permeability characteristics for containing-gas
raw coal under different stress conditions. It is very important for the application of deep
underground engineering. The authors presented their experimental results on permeability
characteristics for containing-gas raw coal under different stress conditions. I recommend this
manuscript can be published after the following minor revisions:
1. The introduction is expressed in concise written form. The research status and development
part (from line 56 to line 102) have to be summarized in short words instead of listing them.
2. Some grammar mistakes have been found in the paper, such as "investigate" (line 83), which
should be changes to "investigated". Be careful of your every words before paper submission.
3. The notion ‘load-unload rate’ is not obvious for readers, load-unload velocity is better.
4. In this manuscript, there are several spelling mistakes, please check the whole text carefully
and makes modifications.
For example,
(1) Line 125, "fro tests",
(2) Line 153, "gas press".
5. "The standard cylindrical raw coal samples whose precision meets the requirements of the
testing method about mechanical properties of coal and rock [24]". It seems that several main
indicators are able to be given on condition the samples were tested beforehand.
6. The loading and unloading confining pressure exerted during the post-peak period where the
specimen has already damaged doesn’t seem as that valuable as expected in consideration of field
application.
7. Under the same conditions, the specimen’s seepage velocity gradually decreases with the
increasing of deviatoric stress, and gradually increases with the declining of deviatoric stress.
What factors, under the same axial pressure and gas pressure, cause the inconformity that the
specimen’s seepage velocity under the confining pressure 6MPa is lower than that of the 8MPa’s
in this manuscript?
8. In the post-peak loading and unloading test period, axial displacement is applied to control the
axial load and radial stress is adopted to control the loading and unloading confining pressure.
Therefore, the change of seepage velocity is both affected by axial stress and confining pressure in
the process of post-peak loading and unloading. It seems that the influence of axial stress should
be taken into consideration when fitting the relationship curves between seepage velocity and
confining pressure of the sample.

Thank you for your constructive and helpful suggestion.
Under the mining conditions, the stress redistribution and stress concentration of the
underground space are caused by the mining. With the mining progresses, the original stress
state of the surrounding coal changes and the bearing capacity of the coal seam also changes
accordingly. With the excavation of the working face, the coal seam in front of the working
ace can be divided into the stress reducing zone, the stress increasing area and the original
stress area. With the continuous advancement of the working face, the front coal seam is
affected by the forward moving abutment stress and dynamic pressure, the coal seam is
always in loading and unloading state, and before and after overlying the main roof of coal
seam sometimes causes sudden destruction of coal body to form the dynamic pressure
phenomenon, which poses a serious threat to safety of the coal mine. From the engineering
4
application point of view, the coal seam is in a complex stress and strain environment, the gas
seepage characteristics of coal seam are controlled by the pore and crack structure, and the
change of pore and crack are controlled by the change of stress of coal and rock. In the
process of mining, the coal seam undergoes multiple stresses such as mining stress and
ectonic stress, resulting in the destruction of the coal seam, but the destroyed coal seam still
has a certain carrying capacity, while the post-peak coal body is subject to both axial stress
and confining pressure, resulting in a complex change in the permeability characteristics of
he coal sample. Therefore, it is particularly important to further study the seepage
characteristics under complex stress conditions.
<U+F0D8> 7 Under the same conditions, the specimen’s seepage velocity gradually decreases with
he increasing of deviatoric stress, and gradually increases with the declining of
deviatoric stress. What factors, under the same axial pressure and gas pressure, cause
he inconformity that the specimen’s seepage velocity under the confining pressure
6MPa is lower than that of the 8MPa’s in this manuscript?
Reply:
Thank you for your constructive and helpful suggestion.
Under the same confining pressure, as the axial pressure increases, the seepage velocity
of the sample will decrease firstly and then increase. When the confining pressure is unloaded
rom 8.6MPa to 6.0MPa, the sample has experienced the loading and unloading of axial
pressure for one time. When axial pressure is loaded, the internal micro gaps and holes of the
sample will be closed, but the unloading axial pressure will not enable compacted holes and
cracks to fully restore to the original shape, then the seepage velocity of the sample will not
be restored, which means that the sample is plastically deformed and the internal parts have
been damaged. But during the unloading process of confining pressure, the seepage velocity
of the sample will gradually increase, but it will always less than that when the confining
pressure is 8.6Mpa.
<U+F0D8> 8 In the post-peak loading and unloading test period, axial displacement is applied to
control the axial load and radial stress is adopted to control the loading and unloading
5
confining pressure. Therefore, the change of seepage velocity is both affected by axial
stress and confining pressure in the process of post-peak loading and unloading. It seems
hat the influence of axial stress should be taken into consideration when fitting the
relationship curves between seepage velocity and confining pressure of the sample.
Reply:
Thank you for your constructive and helpful suggestion.
In the process of post-peak loading and unloading confining pressure, the change of the
seepage flow of the coal specimen is affected by the axial pressure and the confining pressure,
and the figure 9 analyzed the relationship between the deviatoric stress, confining pressure
and seepage flow, while the deviatoric stress is equal to the difference between axial stress
and confining pressure, that is, this paper considers the effect of axial stress and confining
pressure on the seepage flow of the coal sample. Due to the sample has been destroyed after
post-peak loading and unloading of confining pressure. Macro cracks have been produced
nside the sample, and axial pressure has been posted from the axial direction of the sample
hrough displacement. Then, the loading of confining pressure enables macro cracks to
gradually close, causing the seepage velocity of the sample to non-linearly decrease, but the
unloading of confining pressure enables macro cracks to gradually expand, the cracks inside
he sample will further expand and new cracks have been produced with combined action

Coal and gas outburst is one of the most typical gas disasters in underground coal mine
mining in China. It not only causes major casualties and property losses, but also brings
serious social impact, which makes the production safety of coal mine face great challenges.
n the process of mining, the coal seam is deformed and destroyed by the effect of mining,
and the internal permeability of the coal seam will change dynamically. It is an important
eason for the coal and gas outburst of coal mine gas dynamic phenomena. Therefore, it is of
great theoretical and practical significance to the evaluation of coal and gas outburst
prevention during the coal mining to study the permeability characteristics of gas-containing
coal in the complete stress and strain process, and objectively and accurately grasp the
nfiltration state of coal seam during mining process. So, this paper simulates the influence of
gas pressure and loading and unloading confining pressure post-peak on the permeability of
aw coal by adopting "THM coupled with servo-controlled seepage apparatus for containing-
gas coal", raw coal samples prepared from 2+3# outburst coal seam of shamushu coal mine in
coal and gas outburst mine. The research results can provide certain theoretical guidance for
gas draining and outburst prevention for Shamushu coal mine and other similar mines.

change content.
The specimens were taken from S3012 working face of 2+3# coal seam of Shamushu
coal mine FuRong company in Yibin, Sichuan province, southwest China. The strike length
of the S3012 working face is 752m, and the slope length is 136m, the depth of the working
ace is about 450m, the average dip angle is 4°, the thickness is about 0.8m~4.4m, the average

Reply:
Thank you for your constructive and helpful suggestion.
The scheme design has been rewritten (Line 156-Line 181), as follows:
(1) An isotropic in-situ stress state of s1=s2(s3)=8.6MPa was applied to the specimen
this is the loading path OA). Then, adjust the gas pressure p1=1.0MPa, fully absorb the
sample for 12h, open the gas outlet value, when the flow rate stable, adjust the gas pressure by
he pressure relief valve from 0.5MPa to 1.0MPa to 1.5MPa to 0.5MPa, respectively. Then,
with the maintenance of confining pressure at 8.6MPa and the gas pressure at 0.5MPa, loaded
axial stress phase-by-phase up to 18.6MPa (AB stage) and 25.85MPa (BC stage). After that,
unloaded the axial stress to 8.6MPa (CA stage). And then unloaded the confining pressure
down to 6.0MPa (AD stage) with the axial stress level of 8.6MPa.
(2) Maintaining the constant confining pressure at 6.0MPa and gas pressure at 0.5MPa,
oaded axial stress phase-by-phase to 18.6MPa (DE stage) and 25.85MPa (EF stage). After
hat , when the flow rate stable, unloaded axial stress to 8.6MPa (FD stage). And then
unloaded the confining pressure down to 4.0MPa (DG stage) with the axial stress keeping at
8.6MPa.
(3) Maintaining the constant confining pressure at 4.0MPa and gas pressure at 0.5MPa,
oaded axial stress phase-by-phase to 18.6MPa (GH stage) and 25.85MPa (HI stage).
10
(4) Maintaining the constant confining pressure at 4.0MPa and gas pressure at 0.5MPa,
he axial stress control was changed to displacement control at a speed of 0.1mm/minm, and
he axial stress was continuously loaded until the specimen was destroyed (this is the loading
path IJ).
(5) After the sample was destroyed, cycle loading and unloading confining pressure
estaments were carried for four times, meanwhile, the axial stress was loaded at a
displacement loading rate of 0.1mm/min.
After the session AB completed, it’s gas pressure was diverted with the steps of
0.5MPa<U+2192>1.0MPa<U+2192>1.5MPa<U+2192>0.5MPa (maintained each step’s gas pressure for 5mins to
stable the flow rate).The same test was carried for all the stages of BC,CA+AD, DE, EF,
FD+DG, GH, and HI. Particularly, within the process of these tests above all, the loading and
unloading velocity of axial stress was strictly kept at 0.05kN/s, the unloading rate of confining
pressure of pre-peak at 0.02MPa/s, the loading and unloading velocity of confining pressure
of post-peak at 0.05MPa/s.

Due to the progresses of loading and unloading confining pressure of post-peak, the axial
stress is applied at a displacement control rate of 0.1mm/min, and confining pressure is
applied at a speed of 0.05MPa/s. With the loading of confining pressure, the axial stress of the
sample increases linearly, and the corresponding deviatoric stress increases linearly. The
cracks and pores in the coal sample are closed slowly. At this time, the seepage flow of the
sample decreases nonlinearly. When the confining pressure is loaded to 98% of the
predetermined value 9MPa, the influence of experimental system on the loading velocity of
confining pressure will automatically decrease, the internal cracks and partial pores in the coal
sample are almost completely closed, and difficultyof gas circulation is further increased. and
he rate of decrease of seepage flow of the sample is reduced. At the same time, the axial
stress is always in the process of uniform speed loading controlled by displacement, which
eads to the rapid increase of axial stress of the coal sample, and the corresponding deviatoric
stress of the coal sample increases rapidly. When the confining pressure is loaded to 9MPa,
he axial stress of the specimen is larger, that is, the deviatoric stress of coal sample is larger,
and the cracks and pores in the sample are closed completely, and the seepage velocity of the
sample is almost constant at this time. As a result, the minimum seepage velocity point of the
sample corresponds to the peak stress point of the stress-strain curve of the specimen.

<U+F0D8>6) Are the loading and unloading rates, which are not mentioned in the test procedure,
affecting the testing results?
Reply:
Thank you for your constructive and helpful suggestion.
The different loading and unloading rates have a certain influence on the test results.
Scholars at home and abroad have conducted a lot of research on mechanical, deformation
and permeability characteristics of coal specimens under different loading and unloading rates.
Zhao et al. [1] believed that the permeability of coal specimens will increases gradually
as the loading and unloading velocity ratio (that is, the ratio is the loading rate of axial stress
and the unloading rate of confining pressure) of coal sample decreases.
He et al. [2] believed that as the unloading rate decreases, the acoustic emission signals
of granite sample decreases, indicating that the number of internal cracks in the rock is
significantly reduced. The research results are of great significance for understanding the
mechanism of rock burst under different unloading rates.
Jiang et al. [3] believed that when the confining pressure was unloaded at a higher speed,
he destabilizing breakage was easier to happen on the coal which also represented shorter
ime to maintain at the stage of stress flat roof. The permeability of coal increased at a faster
ate when the unloading speed was larger. During the unloading process of confining
pressures, the permeability of coal being in the stage of stress flat roof showed an exponential
unction with the corresponding time.
From the above literatures, it can be seen that the loading and unloading rates has a
certain influence on the test results. In the test schemes (1), (2), (3) and (4) of this paper, the
oading and unloading rate of axial stress is constant at 0.05kN/s, and the unloading rate of
confining pressure of the sample is constant at 0.02MPa/s, that is, the loading rates of axial
stress and confining pressure are kept constant. In the post-peak period, the axial stress was
changed to the rate of displacement control 0.1mm/min, the loading and unloading rate of
confining pressure was changed to 0.05MPa/s, and the loading and unloading rates of axial
pressure and confining pressure in the post-peak loading and unloading phase were also kept
constant. Therefore, it can be considered that the axial stress and the confining pressure
oading and unloading rate have little effect on the test results, and the effect of loading and
15
unloading rate of axial pressure and confining pressure on the test results is not considered in
his manuscript.

I have analyzed the stress sensitively of coal permeability under different loading-
unloading cycles, and this part of content has been added in this manuscript (Line 329-Line
350), as follows:
4) Stress sensitively analysis of coal permeability
According to the test results in table 3, and the analysis of the test results in section 2)
and 3), when the gas pressure was increased from 0.5MPa to 1.0MPa and 1.5MPa,
espectively, (that is, the gas pressure was adjusted 2.0 times and 3.0 times the initial gas
pressure respectively), the average flow rate of the sample increases to 2.4 and 5.12 times of
he initial flow rate. When the axial stress was loaded phase-by-phase from 8.6MPa to
18.6MPa and 25.85MPa, respectively, (that is, the axial stress was loaded to 2.16 times and
3.0 times of the initial axial stress respectively), the flow rate of the specimen is reduced to
57.79 % and 40.08% of the initial flow rate respectively. Correspondingly, when the axial
stress was unloaded to 0.72 times and 0.33 times of the initial axial stress respectively, the
low rate increases to 1.46 and 1.963 times of the initial flow rate respectively. While the
confining pressure was unloaded from 8.6MPa to 6.0MPa and 4.0MPa, respectively, (that is,
16
he confining pressure was unloaded to 0.7 times and 0.47 times of the initial confining
pressure, respectively), the average flow rate of the specimen becomes 0.92 times and 1.12
imes of the initial flow rate respectively.
In summary, the flow rate of coal sample gradually decreases with the loading of
axial pressure, and gradually increases with the unloading of axial stress and confinin
g pressure. It also gradually increases as gas pressure increases. Under the same confi
ning pressure and gas pressure, the larger the axial stress, the smaller the flow rate of
coal sample will be. Under the same confining pressure and axial stress, the larger t
he gas pressure, the larger the flow rate of coal sample will be. Under the conditions
of the same axial stress and gas pressure, the flow rate of the coal specimen first de
creases and then increases slowly. Therefore, the flow rate is the most sensitive to flo
w rate of the coal specimen, followed by the confining pressure and axial stress.
<U+F0D8>8) According to Figure 10, the power functions fit well with the testing results in the
oading sections, but not quite well in the unloading sections, please give the reason.

Thank you for your constructive and helpful suggestion.
Because of the progresses of loading and unloading confining pressure of post-peak, the
confining pressure was applied with a loading rate of 0.05MPa/s, and the axial stress was
applied at a displacement control rate of 0.1mm/min. With the loading of confining pressure,
he axial stress increases linearly, and the corresponding deviatoric stress increases linearly,
he seepage flow of the sample decreases nonlinearly. When the confining pressure is loaded
o 98% of the predetermined value, the principal stress difference of the sample will increase
apidly. The loading of confining pressure against coal sample from another side will enable
cracks and partial holes to be closed or deformed, the circulation channel for gas will become
smaller, then the seepage velocity of the gas will non-linearly decrease. When the loading of
confining pressure for the sample reaches the predetermined value of 9MPa, the influence of
experimental system on the loading velocity of confining pressure will automatically decrease,
while axial pressure has been loading under the constant speed through displacement, the
axial stress of the sample will increase rapidly, the corresponding principal stress difference
will increase rapidly and the seepage velocity of the sample will decrease rapidly. When the
confining pressure was loaded to about 98% of the predetermined value in the whole loading
17
process, the flow rate of the specimen is reduced rapidly, and the cracks and pores in the
specimen are almost completely closed at this time. Although the flow rate of samples
decreases rapidly, the reduction is small. Therefore, the relationship curves between the flow
ate and confining pressure of the specimen during the loading confining pressure is
subordinate to the power function relation, the correlation coefficient is above 0.983, and the
correlation is better.
With the unloading of confining pressure, the axial stress continues to increase. The
unloading amplitude of the confining pressure is far less than the growth rate of the axial
stress, which results in the deviatoric stress reaches the maximum when the confining
pressure was unloaded to 6.86MPa (about 76.22% of the initial confining pressure), and the
low rate increases slowly in this process, but the increase rate is smaller. If the confining
pressure continues to unload, the principal stress difference will firstly gradually increase
before decreasing, during which the gas low of the sample will gradually increase, and the
ncrease velocity will become greater and greater. The likely reason is: during the primary
stage of unloading confining pressure, the axial pressure of the sample will continue to
ncrease through displacement, the deviatoric stress of the sample will continue to increase,
which the unloading of confining pressure will not enable the closed cracks to effectively
open, then the seepage velocity of the sample will increase slowly. When the unloading of the
confining pressure reaches certain value, the axial stress of the sample will begin to decrease
with the unloading of confining pressure, which means that the principal stress difference
change will experience a turning point during the unloading process of confining pressure
after peak. The closed cracks and gaps inside the sample will gradually open and expand, and
new cracks will be produced, the seepage velocity of the sample will non-linearly increase
and the increase velocity will be greater and greater. The deviatoric stress in the whole
unloading confining pressure process is divided into two parts: the first part, the confining
pressure is unloaded from 9MPa to 6.86MPa, meanwhile, the deviatoric stress of coal
specimen gradually increases, which causes the flow rate to increase slowly. The second part,
he confining pressure is unloaded from 6.86MPa to a predetermined value of 4MPa, the
deviatoric stress of the sample begins to slowly decrease. At this time, the flow rate of the
sample changes from slowly increasing to rapidly increasing, and the unloading growth rate
18
of the confining pressure become more and more. Therefore, fitting the relationship curves
between the confining pressure and flow rate is divided into two parts, the first part of the
difficulty for gas to flow in the coal mainly depends on the maturity of seepage channels such
as cracks and effective holes inside the seepage agents, and the mature the seepage channels
will be beneficial to the circulation of gas in the coal.
