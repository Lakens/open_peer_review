The paper discusses a manufacturing method used to add a polymer porous surface to stainless
steel microneedles in order to increase the surface area/volume to deliver an increased volume of
drug.
While the method effectively creates a porous surface on the microneedles, the paper needs more
quantitative analysis on this porous surface. Results have shown the ability of the porous coated
microneedles to deliver model drugs but more detailed 3D porosimetry analysis is needed to
really understand the value of this approach compared to previously reported microneedles.
Further details are required on the manufacturing methods for the stainless steel (should be
abbreviated to SS not SUS in-line with international standards) microneedle patches - is this a
3
potentially scalable and cost-effective manufacturing technique?
General issues:
- A number of reference seem to be misplaced. Please check all references, I ceased to comment
on them after ref 13.
- In the introduction, please detail, quantitatively, the shortcomings of other methods, eg. limited
volume in coated MNs, marginal increases in surface area and low delivery rate. These can then
be compared with the papers results in the discussion section.
- In drug delivery results for calcein, rhodamine B and lidocaine there is no indication of the
volume of drug loaded initially. This makes it difficult to compare and contrast results for drug
delivered if you start off with different loading volumes. This device could add value due to the
increased loading volume, which you state as a limitation of solid coated microneedles. This
loading volume could then be quantified against other papers.
- A better description of type a and type b MNs is needed along with an indication as to which
was used for each experiment.
- A better, more quantitative 3d analysis of the pores is needed.
- It would be good to include needle tip measurements and the effect of the coating on this.
- Statistical analysis and error bars for the graphs presented seem to be absent. Do not quote %
porosity to 3 decimal places unless you are confident that your analytical method can measure
accurately to that precision.
Abstract (Page 2 of 21)
Line 12 – Confusing description: The polymer layer does not impart the mechanical strength of
the microneedles as this could imply
Line 21 – failure load in peel-off test
Line 27 – deformation of skin or MN?
Line 32-39 – State that these delivery tests were done in water and gel respectively.
Introduction, (Page 3 of 21)
Line 8 – Ref2 While Yang et al. 2012 is a good paper it explores a specific method of
manufacturing microneedles. There are a number of recent review papers which have explored
different applications of microneedles which may be a more relevant reference here, perhaps ref3.
Line 11 – well-defined geometry – do you mean sharp tip?
Line 13 – not sure how bending would cause nerve contact.
Line 18 – Microneedles from reference 2 absorb ISF but it is not intended to be used for samples,
only to allow diffusion of the drug. While reference 3, a review paper briefly mentions ISF for
samples, there are review papers which specifically look at microneedles for tissue samples and
would be better cited here.
Line 33 – Only small molecules can permeate through the stratum corneum, the microneedles
pierce the SC and so the drug bypasses the SC.
Line 37 – Very instead of vary
Line 42 – Check reference 11 (hydrogel MN not coated)
Line 48 – I think ref 11 needs to go here as it refers to limited ability of coated MNs.
Page 4 of 21
Line 29 – Some porous microneedles have been shown to penetrate human skin, so not all porous
microneedles are fragile. Be more specific here.
Line 42 – Unclear you mean here.
Page 6 of 21
4
Line 20-28 – Not clear how type A was made, a clearer description or a figure of the
manufacturing method should be included. Clear ref to which experiments types A & B were
used in should be detailed
Line 31 – does the polydimethylsiloxane jig act as the backing layer? A figure could also assist
this description.
Line 33 – change to “polymer coating solution”
Line 49 – “possessed” is not a suitable word, “operated at” may be better.
Line 55 – change to “submerged in a solution…”
Section 2.3 - no real results presented here. Suggest add results or move section to discussion
Page 8 of 21
Line 24 – change to “plates, with and without surface modification, were fixed onto”
Line 28 – Do width and thickness refer to the scratching probe? It is not clear.
Line 42 – Were type a or type b MNs used? what insertion force was used? What skin was used?
How was the skin treated or prepared? Was piercing of the SC proven? If the conditions
described in section 2.6 were used state that.
Line 47 – was type A or type B used?
Line 52 – Was the hair cut with a clippers or removed completely?
Page 9 of 21
Line 4 – was the skin stretched before pinning or was it pinned in a relaxed state?
Line 8 – what concentration of calcein?
Line 41-43 – Were pores selected at random for measurement?
Page 10 of 21
Line 28-30 – My understanding is that the porous layer provided a higher surface area which was
hypothesis would increase the deliverable drug volume. There was no evidence of a rate increase.
Line 34-36 – You have not shown the effects of the ratio and rate, this would be good to show.
Line 46-48 If the pores were measured these results should be included.
Line 50 – What visual aspects were inspected to verify uniformity?
Page 11
Line 11-18 – Visual inspection of the pores is not enough to confirm uniform distribution of pores
or the quality of the interconnectivity of the pores.
Line 44 – Figure 3 B.1 needs a scale bar.
Page 12
Line 36-55 – loads should be presented in N
Page 13
The tissue on the MN after ‘insertion’ could be from the surface of the tissue, it does not mean
that the needles have inserted. Proof of insertion into skin is needed.
Page 14 of 21
Line 8 – 15 – Restructure this sentence.
Line 16 – As the intended use of the MNs is for humans it would be better to reference a paper
comparing porcine skin with human skin.
Line 19 – what force was used for penetration?
Page 15 of 21
Line 37 – how was the insertion depth of 600µm measured?
5
Page 16
Line 20 – 55 – Was the same amount of drug used for both the coated and non-coated? If not, it is
not accurate to state that the 25 times increase is due to the ability of the porous coated MNs to
deliver drugs, as it is also due to a higher drug loading of the MNs.
Page 17 of 21
Fig 7 – B and C should indicate the model drug used in the graph. Error bars also needed. D –
indicate what the curves are.
Line 42 – 47. Further details on the measurement method used to calculate the percentage pore
volume. Surface 2D measurements could be used to approximate the relative pore volume but
there can be large error in using it as a method to measure total percentage pore volume.
Page 18 of 21
Line 16 – Is it just pore size that is increasing or is there also an increase in the number of pores?
From fig 8 it appears both of occurring.

Appendix A
Response to the Reviewers’ Comments
We sincerely thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on our paper. We
revised the paper as possible as faithfully to the comments pointed out as follows.
Reviewer # 1
[Comment 1]
How many drugs can be loaded in porous microneedles?
Response
Hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs can be loaded in porous MNs, as both hydrophobic and
hydrophilic polymer can be used for porous-coating on MNs. Moreover quantity of loading
drugs depend on the porosity of porous layer on MNs. As the porosity increases the quantity
of loading drugs also increases. In our MNs we loaded 2.06µg/ml of lidocaine on the array of
9 MNs as it was confirmed that all loaded drug was released in the receiving medium.
[Comment 2]
The SEM images of porous PLGA-coated micronnedles in Fig. 5A are the same as the images
in Fig. 3A? If so, the images in Fig. 5A can be deleted.
Response
These are different images. Fig 3A represents morphology of porous MNs, while 5A and 5B is
the same MNs used for insertion in the skin to inspect the morphology before and after insertion.
[Comment 3]
In Fig.6, the length of MNs is 600 µm, the drug, calcein, is also coated on the surface of non-
1
coated MNs. Why the calcein can be only observed on sections h1 and h2?
Response
With non-coated MNs, most of the drug get wiped off during insertion and remains on the
surface of the skin as can be seen in fig 7A. Whereas with porous coated MNs, the wiping off
of the drug does not occur because the drug is carried in the pores as the needle penetrates the
skin.
[Comment 4]
The quality of Fig. 7D need to improve.
Response
As suggested by the reviewer, we added a better quality figure.
[Comment 5]
New developments on transdermal delivery using microneedles should be cited. Such as,
Journal of Materials Chemistry B, 2017, 5(48), 9507-9513; 2017, 5(41), 8200-8208; Materials
Science and Engineering C, 2017, 80, 187-196; 2017, 73, 425-428; 2017, 71, 725-734; 2017,
78, 420-428.
Response
As suggested we added these references in the manuscript at their appropriate places.
[Comment 6]
The drug release rate for the MNs with different porosity?
Response
Yes, the drug release rate depends on porosity. The effect of porosity on drug release was
2
described in section 3.6 and Fig 8B.

[Comment]
The paper needs more quantitative analysis on this porous surface… more detailed 3D
porosimetry analysis is needed to really understand the value of this approach compared to
previously reported microneedles.
Response
Thank you for the comment. As suggested by the reviewer, we performed 3D porosimetry
analysis for the inspection of porous surface. The results were added in section 2.7 and 3.1.
[Comment]
Further details are required on the manufacturing methods for the stainless steel
Response
Type A MNs were prepared by metal cutting process. We rephrased the relevant paragraph in
response to this comment. The paragraph is quoted below for a quick reference.
Two types of MNs were coated. To coat first type of MNs (type A, obtained from a
local company, “UBioMed”), a 25 mm square plate of Poly(methyl methacrylate) was
machined to a height of 3 mm and a jig was used to fashion holes for nine
microneedles. The height and diameter of the microneedles on the array were 0.600
mm and 0.120 mm, respectively. An array of 3 × 3 microneedles with intervals of 2
mm was prepared by inserting microneedles into an acrylic plate. Fabrication of the
second type of MNs (type B) used 4 mm long microneedles that were cut from a SS
wire with a 0.3 mm diameter. These MNs were then inserted in a polydimethylsiloxane
3
jig. Further details about type A MNs can be found in supporting data (Fig. S1). Type
B MNs were used only for visual comparison of Rhodamine B dye delivery in the
gelatin gel whereas in all other experiments type A was used.
[Comment]
should be abbreviated to SS not SUS in-line with international standards
Response
As suggested, we replaced all occurrences of SUS with SS.
[Comment]
is this a potentially scalable and cost-effective manufacturing technique?
Response
Yes, it is scalable and cost-effective technique, because many metal microneedles are already
commercialized and our coating method is applicable to all types of microneedles.
[Comment]
A number of reference seem to be misplaced. Please check all references, I ceased to comment
on them after ref 13.
Response
Thank you for the comment. We carefully reviewed all references and placed them properly.
[Comment]
In the introduction, please detail, quantitatively, the shortcomings of other methods, eg. limited
volume in coated MNs, marginal increases in surface area and low delivery rate. These can
then be compared with the papers results in the discussion section.
4
Response
As suggested, we quantitatively described shortcomings of other methods. The paragraph is
quoted below for a quick reference.
this approach is rather limited due to the small dimensions of the MNs shaft and
tip 11. An array of 36 MNs was used to coat 9µL of drug formulation and only 40%
of the loaded drug was delivered….
..however, only marginal increases in the surface area have been achieved.
Specifically, Ryu et al. achieved approximately 200 nm² size craters on the surface
area by electromechanical machining methods.
[Comment]
In drug delivery results for calcein, rhodamine B and lidocaine there is no indication of the
volume of drug loaded initially. This makes it difficult to compare and contrast results for drug
delivered if you start off with different loading volumes. This device could add value due to
the increased loading volume, which you state as a limitation of solid coated microneedles.
This loading volume could then be quantified against other papers.
Response
Unlike drug-coated MNs where drug formulation is loaded on MNs, we used porous coating
for drug loading in which loaded volume depends on the porosity of porous coating. Our target
was to maximize the quantity of loading drug with different porosity as described in section
3.6.
[Comment]
A better description of type a and type b MNs is needed along with an indication as to which
5
was used for each experiment.
Response
Type A MNs were prepared by metal cutting process. We obtained it from a local company
“UBioMed”. Type B was cut from SS wire with 0.3mm diameter. For clarity, we rephrased the
relevant paragraph in response to this comment. The paragraph is quoted below for a quick
reference.

found in supporting data (Fig. S1). Type B MNs were used only for visual
comparison of Rhodamine B dye delivery in the gelatin gel whereas in all other
experiments type A was used.
[Comment]
A better, more quantitative 3d analysis of the pores is needed.
Response
Thank you for the comment. As suggested by the reviewer, we performed 3D porosimetry
analysis for the morphology of porous surface. The results were added in section 2.7 and 3.1.
6
[Comment]
It would be good to include needle tip measurements and the effect of the coating on this.
Response
Thank you for the comment. Details about the geometry of MN has been added in the
supporting data (Fig. S1). The effect of coating on tip is shown in (Fig S3)
[Comment]
Statistical analysis and error bars for the graphs presented seem to be absent. Do not quote %
porosity to 3 decimal places unless you are confident that your analytical method can measure
accurately to that precision.
Response
In our study we performed the drug delivery analysis three time. The data was not sufficient to
make error bar. Moreover, we removed the decimal part from the % porosity.
[Comment]
Line 12 – Confusing description: The polymer layer does not impart the mechanical strength
of the microneedles as this could imply
Response
To remove the confusion, we rephrased the sentence as given below.
Stainless steel (SS) MNs of high mechanical strength were coated with a thin
porous polymer layer to enhance their delivery rates.
[Comment]
Line 21 – failure load in peel-off test
7
Response
The definition of the term failure load was added. The sentence now reads.
The average failure load (the minimum force sufficient for detaching the polymer
layer from the surface of stainless steel) recorded for the modified surface coating
was 25 N, whereas it was 2.2 N for the non-modified surface.
[Comment]
Line 27 – deformation of skin or MN?
Response
Without deformation of microneedle. The sentence has been modified for clarity as given below.
Calcein dye was successfully delivered into porcine skin to a depth of 750 µm by
the porous polymer-coated MNs, demonstrating that the developed MNs can pierce
skin easily without deformation of MNs.
[Comment]
Line 32-39 – State that these delivery tests were done in water and gel respectively.
Response.
Delivery into gel was only performed for visual comparison, whereas delivery into PBS was
performed for quantitative comparison. The following sentence was added to the abstract to
clarify this.
For visual comparison, lodamine B dye was delivered using porous-coated and
non-coated MNs in gelatin gel which showed that delivery with porous MNs
penetrate deeper as compared to non-porous MNs.
8
[Comment]
Line 8 – Ref2 While Yang et al. 2012 is a good paper it explores a specific method of
manufacturing microneedles. There are a number of recent review papers which have explored
different applications of microneedles which may be a more relevant reference here, perhaps
ref3.
Response
We agree with the reviewer. The references have been modified accordingly.
[Comment]
Line 11 – well-defined geometry – do you mean sharp tip?
Response
By well-defined geometry, we meant smooth surface and sharp tip. The sentence has been
modified for clarity. Now it reads:
Depending on the application, needles must have suitable length to avoid nerve contact, and
smooth surface, sharp tip and high mechanical strength to penetrate skin without cracking,
breaking, or bending…
[Comment]
Line 13 – not sure how bending would cause nerve contact.
Response
Actually it’s the length of the needle that can cause nerve contact. We have modified the
sentence to clearly mention this. The modified sentence is as given below.
Depending on the application, needles must have suitable length to avoid nerve
9
contact, and smooth surface, sharp tip and high mechanical strength to penetrate
skin without cracking, breaking, or bending…
[Comment]
Line 18 – Microneedles from reference 2 absorb ISF but it is not intended to be used for samples,
only to allow diffusion of the drug. While reference 3, a review paper briefly mentions ISF for
samples, there are review papers which specifically look at microneedles for tissue samples
and would be better cited here.
Response
We agree the reviewer and included the following reference.
L. Strambini, A. Longo, S. Scarano, T. Prescimone, I. Palchetti, M. Minunni, D.
Giannessi and G. Barillaro, Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 2015, 66, 162-168.
[Comment]
Line 33 – Only small molecules can permeate through the stratum corneum, the microneedles
pierce the SC and so the drug bypasses the SC.
Response
The sentence on line 33 was modified to clarify the idea. Now it reads (along with the previous
sentence):
Solid MNs are very short physical needles used to puncture the skin and open
micro-pathways painlessly in the skin through which a drug formulation can be
introduced6-8. Once the skin is punctured, the drug permeates through the stratum
corneum and then passes through the deeper epidermis and dermis.
[Comment]
10
Line 37 – Very instead of vary
Response
Thank you for the comment. We changed it now it reads
Very short lifespans of such micro-passages are the main limitation of TDDSs
using solid MNs
[Comment]
Line 42 – Check reference 11 (hydrogel MN not coated).
Response
We agree with reviewer’s comment and removed the reference from there and replaced it with
the following reference.
H. S. Gill and M. R. Prausnitz, J. Control. Release, 2007, 117, 227-237.
[Comment]
Line 48 – I think ref 11 needs to go here as it refers to limited ability of coated MNs.
Response
Thank you for the comment. Reference was added as suggested by the reviewer.
[Comment]
Line 29 – Some porous microneedles have been shown to penetrate human skin, so not all
porous microneedles are fragile. Be more specific here.
Response
We have the statement specific. Now the sentence reads:
11
However, polymer porous MNs are fragile and unable to penetrate skin properly
due to insufficient mechanical strength.
[Comment]
Line 42 – Unclear you mean here.
Response
We rephrased the sentence. Now it reads:
Using polymerization, in the presence of porogen, stronger MNs can be fabricated,
however the MNs produced thus have inconsistent geometry and hence are not
suitable for further applications
Furthermore, we updated the relevant reference.
[Comment]
Line 20-28 – Not clear how type A was made, a clearer description or a figure of the
manufacturing method should be included. Clear ref to which experiments types A & B were
used in should be detailed
Response
To remove the confusion, we edited the paragraph as given below.
Two types of MNs were coated. To coat first type of MNs (type A, obtained from
a local company, “UBioMed”), a 25 mm square plate of Poly(methyl
methacrylate) was machined to a height of 3 mm and a jig was used to fashion
holes for nine microneedles. The height and diameter of the microneedles on the
array were 0.600 mm and 0.120 mm, respectively. An array of 3 × 3 microneedles
with intervals of 2 mm was prepared by inserting microneedles into an acrylic
12
plate. Fabrication of the second type of MNs (type B) used 4 mm long
microneedles that were cut from a SS wire with a 0.3 mm diameter. These MNs
were then inserted in a polydimethylsiloxane jig. Further details about type A
MNs can be found in supporting data (Fig. S1). Type B MNs were used only for
visual comparison of Rhodamine B dye delivery in the gelatin gel whereas in all
other experiments type A was used.
[Comment]
Line 31 – does the polydimethylsiloxane jig act as the backing layer? A figure could also assist
this description.
Response
Yes the polydimethylsiloxane acts as a jig for the MNs. For further explanation, we added (Fig.
S2) in the supporting data.
[Comment]
Line 33 – change to “polymer coating solution”
Response
Thank you for the comment. We changed accordingly now it reads:
The polymer coating solution was prepared….
[Comment]
Line 49 – “possessed” is not a suitable word, “operated at” may be better
Response
13
Thank you for the comment. We changed it accordingly now reads:
The plasma generator operated at a frequency….
[Comment]
Line 55 – change to “submerged in a solution…”
Response
Thank you for the comment. We changed it accordingly now reads:
submerged in a solution of 2 % PEI (w/w) in water…
[Comment]
Section 2.3 - no real results presented here. Suggest add results or move section to discussion
Response
We agree with reviewer’s comment and moved this section to discussion.
[Comment]
Line 24 – change to “plates, with and without surface modification, were fixed onto”
Response
Thank you for the comment. We changed it accordingly now reads:
Each sample of the PLGA-coated SS plates with and without surface modification,
were fixed onto motor-driven jaws….
[Comment]
Line 28 – Do width and thickness refer to the scratching probe? It is not clear.
Response
14
Yes, for clarity we changed sentence. Now it reads:
… width of probe (15.000) mm, thickness of probe (0.3800 mm),
[Comment]
Line 42 – Were type a or type b MNs used? what insertion force was used? What skin was used?
How was the skin treated or prepared? Was piercing of the SC proven? If the conditions
described in section 2.6 were used state that.
Response
Questions about which type MNs were used in which experiments have been answered in
response to a comment above (in this case type A was used).
Moreover, the conditions of Section 2.5 (then Section 2.6) apply. We added the following
sentence to remove any ambiguities.
The details about skin used are given in Section 2.5.
[Comment]
Line 47 – was type A or type B used?
Response
Questions about which type MNs were used in which experiments have been answered in
response to a comment above (in this case type A was used).
[Comment]
Line 52 – Was the hair cut with a clippers or removed completely?
Response
15
The hair was cut with clipper. For clarity we rephrased the sentence as below:
The hair was carefully cut using hair clippers….
[Comment]
Line 4 – was the skin stretched before pinning or was it pinned in a relaxed state?
Response
The skin was not stretched, it was pinned down in relaxed state.
[Comment]
Line 8 – what concentration of calcein?
Response
5% w/w calcein solution in water was used. Accordingly, we modified the sentences which
now reads:
Briefly, porous polymer-coated and non-coated MNs were dipped in 5% calcein
aqueous solution…
[Comment]
Line 41-43 – Were pores selected at random for measurement?
Response
Yes, pores were randomly chosen. For clarity, we changed the sentence as given below:
Pores from different porous-coated MNs were randomly chosen and visualized using
the Image-J software package, and the diameters of various porous-coated MNs were
measured to ensure uniformity of the porous-coated layer.
16
[Comment]
Line 28-30 – My understanding is that the porous layer provided a higher surface area which
was hypothesis would increase the deliverable drug volume. There was no evidence of a rate
increase.
Response
Unlike drug-coated MNs where the polymer is dissolved along with the drug and takes a long
time, in our MNs, the drug is diffused in the body in shorter time from the pores of MNs without
dissolving the polymer. Our target was to maximize the quantity of delivered drug and
minimize the time of diffusion. The diffusion process was completed in 1 minute, as mentioned
in description of experiments, which is many orders of magnitude shorter than that of drug-
coated MNs.
[Comment]
Line 34-36 – You have not shown the effects of the ratio and rate, this would be good to show.
Response
The effects of the ratio is demonstrated in the results and discussion (please refer to sec 3.6 and
Fig 8). Moreover, the effects of rate was studied in our previous work given as reference there.
[Comment]
Line 46-48 If the pores were measured these results should be included.
Response
As asked by the reviewer, we added the results about pores measurements in the supporting
data. (Fig. S4).
17
[Comment]
Line 50 – What visual aspects were inspected to verify uniformity?
Response
The diameter of porous coated MNs was measured to verify the uniformity of the porous coated
layers.
[Comment]
Line 11-18 – Visual inspection of the pores is not enough to confirm uniform distribution of
pores or the quality of the interconnectivity of the pores.
Response
To show that pores are uniformly distributed, we sampled various regions of area and measured
the pores. We added the results in supporting data. (Fig. S4).
To show the interconnectivity of pores, we added a magnified figure (Fig. S3) which clearly
shows that pores are highly interconnected.
[Comment]
Line 44 – Figure 3 B.1 needs a scale bar.
Response
Thank you for the comment. As asked by the reviewer, we added the scale bar.
[Comment]
Line 36-55 – loads should be presented in N
Response
18
As asked by the reviewer, we presented loads in N.
[Comment]
The tissue on the MN after ‘insertion’ could be from the surface of the tissue, it does not mean
that the needles have inserted. Proof of insertion into skin is needed.
Response
As can be seen in Fig. S1, section X of the needles is coated. We ensured that the entire section
X was inserted into the skin during experiments.
[Comment]
Line 8 – 15 – Restructure this sentence.
Response
The sentence was broken in to two for clarity. They read as given below:
To investigate in vitro drug delivery by the porous polymer-coated and non-
coated microneedles in skin, porcine skin rather than live animals was selected
for ethical reasons. Previous studies have shown that the delivery efficiency
obtained in vitro in porcine skin is similar to that of in vivo in mice.
[Comment]
Line 16 – As the intended use of the MNs is for humans it would be better to reference a paper
comparing porcine skin with human skin.
Response
We agree the reviewer and included the following reference
A. Summerfield, F. Meurens and M. E. Ricklin, Molecular immunology, 2015, 66,
19
14-21.….
[Comment]
Line 19 – what force was used for penetration?
Response
The MNs were inserted manually in the skin.
[Comment]
Line 37 – how was the insertion depth of 600µm measured?
Response
As can be seen in Fig. S1, the length of section X of the MN is 600µm and we ensured that the
entire section X was inserted. This is how we measured the insertion depth.
[Comment]
Line 20 – 55 – Was the same amount of drug used for both the coated and non-coated? If not,
it is not accurate to state that the 25 times increase is due to the ability of the porous coated
MNs to deliver drugs, as it is also due to a higher drug loading of the MNs.
Response
Our point is that the amount of drug loading is different. More drug is loaded by filling the
pores of porous MNs. Eventually the amount of drug delivered was 25 times.
[Comment]
Fig 7 – B and C should indicate the model drug used in the graph. Error bars also needed. D –
indicate what the curves are.
20
Response
As asked by the reviewer, we added the model drug in the graphs. Curves show the UV
spectrometry data (i.e., absorbances) to prepare the standard curve for drug delivery
quantification. …
[Comment]
Line 42 – 47. Further details on the measurement method used to calculate the percentage pore
volume. Surface 2D measurements could be used to approximate the relative pore volume but
there can be large error in using it as a method to measure total percentage pore volume.
Response
As suggested by the reviewer, we performed 3D porosimetry analysis for the inspection of
porous surface. The results were added in section 2.7 and 3.1. Moreover we added the
measurement data in the supporting information. (Fig.S4).
[Comment]
Line 16 – Is it just pore size that is increasing or is there also an increase in the number of pores?
From fig 8 it appears both of occurring.
Response
We agree with the reviewer that an increase in both pore number and size is occurring.
Accordingly, we modified the sentences which now read:
This increase can be attributed to an increase in the sizes and number of pores in
the polymer coating on the microneedles,…
[Comment]
21
Line 13 – peel-off load
Response
We defined the term failure load as “the minimum force sufficient for detaching the polymer
layer from the surface of stainless steel” at the first occurrence of the term in the manuscript.
