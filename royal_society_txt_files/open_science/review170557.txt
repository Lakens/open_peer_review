Comments:
The manuscript presents fabrication methodology of vertically-aligned ZnO nanowires with
different aspect ratio and performance of miniaturized accelerometers using the functional ZnO
nanowires layers. The use of vertically aligned ZnO nanowires as a functional layer for
accelerometer sounds interesting as considering its benefits. However, the manuscript cannot be
recommended for publication in its present form. The manuscript should be improved as
considering following lists of comments.
1. In chapter 3, authors mentioned that ZnO nanowires with two different length of 6 um and 12
um were prepared, while authors also described that average length of nanowires was 10 um.
Since around 20% difference in length can cause significant difference in output current, authors
should provide standard deviation of the nanowires length and output current resulting from the
length difference.
2. In figure caption for Fig. 9, authors described "performance comparison of the commercial
accelerometer ~~". However, there is no data profile for the commercial accelerometer in this
figure. Caption or fig.9 should be corrected.
3. In order to improve readability, authors need rescaling Y- axis values in Fig. 9 and 10.
4. In whole manuscript, authors should eliminate grammatical errors (ex. "It was heat") and use
consistent terminologies (ex. nanorod and nanowire)

This paper presents research for a ZnO nanowire accelerometer fabricated by refresh
hydrothermal synthesis. Author claimed that the performance of the ZnO nanowire
accelerometer can be drastically improved by growing long ZnO nanowires. They presented
successful fabrication of long ZnO nanowires uniformly and densely on a copper substrate using
3
two hydrothermal synthesis methods. Device performance was compared with a commercial
accelerometer. This reviewer finds a novelty of approach using long and vertically aligned ZnO
nanowires for accelerometer applications. Nano-materials and device structures are well chosen
to meet the targeted application. Their sensor design and performances are properly verified and
supported with experimental data. Therefore, this reviewer recommends the publication in the
journal with minor revision below.
1. According to the Figure 1, accelerometer performances can be easily influenced by the bottom
electrode that is made of silver epoxy. It is recommended to include more detailed description of
bottom electrode structure and fabrication methods. If there is any test result about the bottom
electrode, it needs to be included and discussed.
2. In page 6, author claimed “The accelerometer made with 12 µm ZnO nanowires shows more
than twice higher sensitivity than the accelerometer made with 6 µm ZnO nanowires because of
the longer length of the ZnO nanowires.” referring their previous publication. Need more
detailed discussion about this statement.
3. In Figure 5, SEM images show ZnO nanowires grown from two hydrothermal synthesis
methods. Authors described the ZnO nanowires with 120 nm diameter and 10 um length.
However Figure 7 to 10 show test results from fabricated devices with 6 um and 12 um ZnO
nanowires. It is recommended to include an SEM image of 12 um ZnO nanowires.
4. SEM images in Figure 5 shows different types of morphology from 6 um and 12 um ZnO
nanowires, respectively. It is expected that they may have different crystalline structures. Was
there any XRD analysis for two different length? Author only discussed effects from the length
difference (6 um and 12 um) in this manuscript. Need more detailed discussion about this.

Comments to the Author(s)
Comments:
The manuscript presents fabrication methodology of vertically-aligned ZnO nanowires with
different aspect ratio and performance of miniaturized accelerometers using the functional ZnO
nanowires layers. The use of vertically aligned ZnO nanowires as a functional layer for
accelerometer sounds interesting as considering its benefits. However, the manuscript cannot be
recommended for publication in its present form. The manuscript should be improved as
considering following lists of comments.
1. In chapter 3, authors mentioned that ZnO nanowires with two different length of 6 um and 12
um were prepared, while authors also described that average length of nanowires was 10 um.
Since around 20% difference in length can cause significant difference in output current, authors
should provide standard deviation of the nanowires length and output current resulting from the
length difference.
Response: Thank you for the comment. The length was 12 micron and no average length was
mentioned in the latest manuscript. 10 um was a mistake.
2. In figure caption for Fig. 9, authors described "performance comparison of the commercial
accelerometer ~~". However, there is no data profile for the commercial accelerometer in this
figure. Caption or fig.9 should be corrected.
Response: Thank you. The caption for Fig. 9 was changed to “Fig 9. Output current of the
fabricated accelerometers with (a) 6 µm and (b) 12 µm ZnO nanowires.”
3. In order to improve readability, authors need rescaling Y- axis values in Fig. 9 and 10.
Response: Thank you. We recalled Y-axis in Fig. 9 and 10.
4. In whole manuscript, authors should eliminate grammatical errors (ex. "It was heat") and use
consistent terminologies (ex. nanorod and nanowire)
Response: Thank you. Relevant corrections were made by carefully proof reading.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper presents research for a ZnO nanowire accelerometer fabricated by refresh
hydrothermal synthesis. Author claimed that the performance of the ZnO nanowire
accelerometer can be drastically improved by growing long ZnO nanowires. They presented
successful fabrication of long ZnO nanowires uniformly and densely on a copper substrate using
two hydrothermal synthesis methods. Device performance was compared with a commercial

nanowires for accelerometer applications. Nano-materials and device structures are well chosen
to meet the targeted application. Their sensor design and performances are properly verified and
supported with experimental data. Therefore, this reviewer recommends the publication in the
journal with minor revision below.
1. According to the Figure 1, accelerometer performances can be easily influenced by the
bottom electrode that is made of silver epoxy. It is recommended to include more detailed
description of bottom electrode structure and fabrication methods. If there is any test result
about the bottom electrode, it needs to be included and discussed.
Response: Thank you for the comment. Silver epoxy was used to bond the ZnO nanowire layer
to the host structure. A small amount of silver epoxy was dropped on the structure and the
fabricated ZnO nanowire layer was pressed until the silver epoxy layer securely covers the ZnO
nanowire layer. No electrical short contact between the top electrode (copper head mass) and the
bottom electrode (silver epoxy layer) was confirmed by measuring resistance between them. If
there is short contact, we did not use the wrong accelerometer.
2. In page 6, author claimed “The accelerometer made with 12 µm ZnO nanowires shows more
than twice higher sensitivity than the accelerometer made with 6 µm ZnO nanowires because of
the longer length of the ZnO nanowires.” referring their previous publication. Need more
detailed discussion about this statement.
Response: Thank you for the comment. Piezoelectric charge of ZnO nanowire is proportionally
induced to the length of the nanowire. Thus, as the length of ZnO nanowire increases, the
sensitivity of the ZnO nanowire accelerometer increases.
3. In Figure 5, SEM images show ZnO nanowires grown from two hydrothermal synthesis
methods. Authors described the ZnO nanowires with 120 nm diameter and 10 um length.
However Figure 7 to 10 show test results from fabricated devices with 6 um and 12 um ZnO
nanowires. It is recommended to include an SEM image of 12 um ZnO nanowires.
Response: Thank you for the comment. The 10 um length was a mistake. It was corrected to 12
um.
4. SEM images in Figure 5 shows different types of morphology from 6 um and 12 um ZnO
nanowires, respectively. It is expected that they may have different crystalline structures. Was
there any XRD analysis for two different length? Author only discussed effects from the length
difference (6 um and 12 um) in this manuscript. Need more detailed discussion about this.
Response: Thank you for the comment. We have observed XRD patterns of ZnO nanowires that
show ZnO nanowires were grown to (002) direction. Similar pattern was expected in this ZnO
nanowire growth.
