1) I am aware that datasets containing individual information provided by private companies are
complicated and sometimes impossible to share, even upon request, but at least the authors must
provide the number of calls, sms and users, particularly in Figure 1 and 2 (and SI). Moreover, I
strongly encourage the authors to give more details about the data cleaning process and to assess
the representativity of the sample by comparing the total number of mobile phone users with
census data easily available on the web.
Unfortunately, our current non-disclosure agreement with the data provider does not permit us
to present any absolute numbers in any publication material. More detailed description of the
data processing procedures was already presented in our previous paper (Ref. 24); a preprint
version of that paper is freely available to anyone in the arXiv repository at
http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4400.
I strongly encourage the authors to assess the representativity of the sample by comparing the
total number of mobile phone users with census data easily available on the web.
2) It is not clear to me how the authors aggregated the data from the voronoi cells to the different
levels of spatial aggregation. Is the aggregation based on the proportion of the voronoi cells’
surface in each spatial unit? I recommend the authors to add a map with the voronoi cell and/or
a histogram of the area covered by the antennas. The authors should provide more details about
the method used to obtain the clusters, in particular, how did the authors determine the number
of clusters?
Data processing and the clustering procedure was described in detail in Ref. 24 (available at
http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4400); here, the same results are applied in this context. More
specifically, in the case of spatial aggregation, activity of a certain antenna is added to the spatial
unit which contains the antenna’s location. In the case of the regular grid, a further smoothing is
applied (i.e. an antenna’s activity is equally distributed among the grid cell containing it and it’s 8
neighbors) to account for the uncertainty in the exact coverage areas of antennas. An inherent
limitation in our research was that only the location of antennas was provided and not the
coverage areas. While generally a mobile device is expected to connect to the “closest” antenna
(antenna with the highest signal level) suggesting an approximation of coverage areas with
Voronoi-polygons, several factors affect this (network load, antenna visibility for the radio signal,
variation in the configuration of antennas including direction, power, planned serving area),
estimation of which were beyond the scope of our work, partly because of not having access to
potentially sensitive data about the details of the network configuration of the operator. The
number of clusters were determined by looking at local maxima in the silhouette index. During
our previous study on data from three cities including the current dataset from London as one of
them, six clusters were found as a local maximum in all cases resulting in well-interpretable
clusters (see Ref. 24 for more details).
Even if the data processing procedure has been already presented in a book chapter, I strongly
encourage the authors to give all the details (in SI) needed by the readers to fully understand the
analysis performed in this paper.
3) In the power spectrum of the time series (Figure S1), the second most significant component
corresponds to 7 weeks; do the authors have any explanations to provide?
We are not quite sure which part of the spectrum the reviewer refers to. If it is the label ‘7’ on the
x-axis, that actually corresponds to a period of one day (i.e. 1/7 week; as the original x-axis of Fig.
S1 displayed frequencies using the somewhat unconventional units of 1/week). To address this
3
possible concern, we updated the x-axis of all spectrograms to display periods in more easily
interpretable units.
OK
4) The predictability score is not easy to interpret, I recommend the authors to add in SI the
results obtained with a commonly used goodness-of-fit measure such as the relative error.
While we understand the reviewers concern, we would like to point out that the predictability
scores used in the manuscript are related to relative errors via a trivial transformation (Eq. (9) in
the updated manuscript); in accordance with this, we believe that adding further analysis using
relative errors would be highly redundant. We added further discussion after the definition of
predictability scores (Eqs. (9) and (10) in the updated manuscript); we hope this will offer a better
presentation of our choice to use them in this work for readers.
The relative error (A-M)/M is, in my opinion, easier to interpret than the predictability scores. I
recommend the authors to add in SI the results obtained with the relative error to have a clear
idea of the deviation of the estimated values from the original ones.
5) I do not think that it is a good idea to weight the predictability error. Generally, the error tends
to decrease with the volume, therefore a low weighted error may be not representative of the
predictive power of the model. Moreover, the authors should also provide the standard deviation
along with the average.
We believe that by using weighted averages, our results better represent that to what extent the
typical activity accounts for the total activity in the city. Note that by weighting the relative
residuals with the activity, the actual summation is carried out on values resembling the absolute
residuals (note that the difference is that the relative residuals were normalized using the mean of
the typicals and actual activity value to make predictability scores bounded), and the result is
normalized by the total activity in the city, thus resulting in an approximation of a city-wide
relative residual.
I believe that weighting the predictability scores plays in favor of the high values which are
usually easier to estimate. In any case, the authors should provide the standard deviation along
with the average.
6) To test a model it is important to divide the sample into two (or more) sub-samples, one to
learn and build the model and the other one(s) to test the model.
While the results are interpreted as how much of the real activity is predicted by typical activities,
actual prediction of future activities is not a goal of this manuscript; the main research question is
to quantify the regularity in mobile network activity patterns. Consequently, we looked at several
possible ways to decompose the activity time series into typical and residual patterns and further
methods to gain insights from the analysing the residual patterns; we believe that actual
prediction of future activity would require more complex models built upon the results obtained
during this analysis. Also, since the dataset is from a limited time interval, modeling seasonal
variation would not be possible; using e.g. the spring interval for training a model would result
in bad performance when applied to the summer period even though the phenomenon of yearly
variation in the data is not surprising at all. To address the reviewers concerns, we modified the
presentation of predictability scores and the related analysis to make the aims of our research and
interpretation of results more clear to the readers.
7) The authors claim that the “models” perform generally well, compared to what? In order to
quantify the performance of the model I recommend the authors to add a null model (uniform
distribution of the total volume for example).
4
The claim about the models in the manuscript refer to the amount of activity explained by the
typical activity in general. We believe that quantifying this is an important result by itself and
that the construction of a null model can be problematic due to the inherent high regularity in the
data (i.e. comparison with time series obtained by a random redistribution of activity would not
be relevant for this in our opinion). We modified the presentation of these results in the text to be
more precise.
I think that it is a problem of terminology, the authors should maybe talk about “typical
activities”, “residual”, “quantify regularity” or “explained variability” more than “model”,
“performance” and “predictability” which are usually used to describe how a set of explanatory
variables can be used to estimate/predict a variable of interest.
8) What is the time window considered to compute the errors in Figure 4?
The averages on Fig. 4 were computed for the period between 1 April 2013 and 30 November
2013 as explained in the text (in section “Predictability of typical patterns”). We updated the main
text (the beginning of section “Spatial limits of predictability”) to include this information in the
context relevant for Fig. 4 too.
OK
9) The correlation between z_i and v_i is clearly not significant. I recommend the authors to add
the correlation coefficient values and/or the Figure S13 in the main text.
We now mention the correlation coefficient in the main text. We agree with the reviewer that the
Pearson correlation value of 0.20982 does not look very high; nevertheless, we argue that given
the high variance in the standardized predictability scores and the large number of points, it can
be considered significant here and thus warrants the use of the adaptive threshold described in
the text. We note that it is not easy to perform a formal hypothesis test for correlation here as it is
not clear how the degrees of freedom should be estimated. Fig. S13 contains a total several
hundred thousand points, but one could argue that those are not all independent; using a modest
estimate of 289 (the number of days in the measurement period) for the degrees of freedom, the
correlation value yields a test statistic of t = 3.64 (for a Student t distribution) which still allows us
to reject the null hypothesis of independent variables at 0.1% confidence level.
Ok, but nevertheless, I recommend the authors to include the Figure S13 in the main text so that
the reader can have a clear idea of what a relationship between two variables “somewhat”
correlated looks like.

Dear Editors,
we hereby present our responses to the second review of our manuscript. We carried out necessary mod-
ifications in the manuscript. We list our responses to the reviewer’s outstanding concerns below. Note
that items 3, 6 and 8 in the original lists of concerns were already answered previously, so we omit those
and only list the items, where new concerns were raised by the reviewer. We hope that these changes
adequately address all remaining concerns and that our work is now suitable for publication in Royal
Society Open Science.
Reviewer #1
1) Original comment: “I am aware that datasets containing individual information provided by private
companies are complicated and sometimes impossible to share, even upon request, but at least the authors
must provide the number of calls, sms and users, particularly in Figure 1 and 2 (and SI). Moreover,
I strongly encourage the authors to give more details about the data cleaning process and to assess the
representativity of the sample by comparing the total number of mobile phone users with census data
easily available on the web.”
Original response: Unfortunately, our current non-disclosure agreement with the data provider does
not permit us to present any absolute numbers in any publication material. More detailed description of
the data processing procedures was already presented in our previous paper (Ref. 24); a preprint version
of that paper is freely available to anyone in the arXiv repository at http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4400.
Reviewer’s response: “I strongly encourage the authors to assess the representativity of the sample
by comparing the total number of mobile phone users with census data easily available on the web.
New response: We carried out a comparison of aggregated communication activities and census-
based population estimates as suggested by the reviewer. The new results are summarized in the Sup-
plementary Material (Figures S17 and S18 and the related discussion in the text). We found nighttime
correlation values between 0.4–0.55 depending on the data type and the area included when using the
smoothed aggregation in 500m grid pixels. This implies that there is a significant correlation, but also
significant differences. We believe the most important factors are that a high number of people stay
out late and that this group generates significantly more activity (with active phone use including calls,
texts and data, while we expect people who stay at home to be much less active or even sleeping and
even data generated from background apps on smartphones will be subsampled due to a high percentage
of devices connecting to a WiFi network when at home), while the presence of transient populations
not recorded in the census (short term visitors staying at hotels, or medium term visitors staying in
rented apartments), business subscriptions which were not filtered due to the nature of data collection,
and uncertainty of the exact coverage areas, especially around the edge of the covered locations further
contribute to these. Nevertheless, we believe that the spatial aggregation is still representative in terms
of distribution of activity volumes on different levels of spatial aggregation and also for the purpose of
estimating regularities and their dependence on the volume of activity, as evidenced by the results of the
clustering procedure and the identified outlier regions.
2) Original comment: “It is not clear to me how the authors aggregated the data from the voronoi
cells to the different levels of spatial aggregation. Is the aggregation based on the proportion of the voronoi
cells’ surface in each spatial unit? I recommend the authors to add a map with the voronoi cell and/or a
histogram of the area covered by the antennas. The authors should provide more details about the method
used to obtain the clusters, in particular, how did the authors determine the number of clusters?”
Original response: Data processing and the clustering procedure was described in detail in Ref. 24
(available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4400); here, the same results are applied in this context. More
which contains the antenna’s location. In the case of the regular grid, a further smoothing is applied
(i.e. an antenna’s activity is equally distributed among the grid cell containing it and it’s 8 neighbors)
to account for the uncertainty in the exact coverage areas of antennas. An inherent limitation in our
research was that only the location of antennas was provided and not the coverage areas. While generally
a mobile device is expected to connect to the “closest” antenna (antenna with the highest signal level)
suggesting an approximation of coverage areas with Voronoi-polygons, several factors affect this (network
load, antenna visibility for the radio signal, variation in the configuration of antennas including direction,
power, planned serving area), estimation of which were beyond the scope of our work, partly because
of not having access to potentially sensitive data about the details of the network configuration of the
operator. The number of clusters were determined by looking at local maxima in the silhouette index.
During our previous study on data from three cities including the current dataset from London as one
of them, six clusters were found as a local maximum in all cases resulting in well-interpretable clusters
(see Ref. 24 for more details).
Reviewer’s response: “Even if the data processing procedure has been already presented in a book
chapter, I strongly encourage the authors to give all the details (in SI) needed by the readers to fully
understand the analysis performed in this paper.”
New response: We have added more detail in a section of text in the Supplementary Material about
the data processing and the clustering procedure to address this concern.
4) Original comment: “The predictability score is not easy to interpret, I recommend the authors
to add in SI the results obtained with a commonly used goodness-of-fit measure such as the relative error.”
Original response: While we understand the reviewers concern, we would like to point out that
the predictability scores used in the manuscript are related to relative errors via a trivial transformation
(Eq. (9) in the updated manuscript); in accordance with this, we believe that adding further analysis
using relative errors would be highly redundant. We added further discussion after the definition of
predictability scores (Eqs. (9) and (10) in the updated manuscript); we hope this will offer a better
presentation of our choice to use them in this work for readers.
Reviewer’s response: “The relative error (A-M)/M is, in my opinion, easier to interpret than the
predictability scores. I recommend the authors to add in SI the results obtained with the relative error to
have a clear idea of the deviation of the estimated values from the original ones.”
New response: We have added Figures S4, S11 and S15 to the Supplementary Material along with
Tables S2, S4, S6, S8, presenting results for relative errors. These findings are all consistent with the
original results we obtained when using the predictability scores.
5) Original comment: “I do not think that it is a good idea to weight the predictability error.
Generally, the error tends to decrease with the volume, therefore a low weighted error may be not rep-
resentative of the predictive power of the model. Moreover, the authors should also provide the standard
deviation along with the average.”
Original response: We believe that by using weighted averages, our results better represent that
to what extent the typical activity accounts for the total activity in the city. Note that by weighting the
relative residuals with the activity, the actual summation is carried out on values resembling the absolute
residuals (note that the difference is that the relative residuals were normalized using the mean of the
typicals and actual activity value to make predictability scores bounded), and the result is normalized
by the total activity in the city, thus resulting in an approximation of a city-wide relative residual.
Reviewer’s response: “I believe that weighting the predictability scores plays in favor of the high
values which are usually easier to estimate. In any case, the authors should provide the standard deviation
along with the average.”
New response: We have added results for predictability scores and relative errors averaged without
weighting and their standard deviations to Tables S2-S8 in the Supplementary Material
7) Original comment: “The authors claim that the ‘models’ perform generally well, compared to
(uniform distribution of the total volume for example).”
Original response: The claim about the models in the manuscript refer to the amount of activity
explained by the typical activity in general. We believe that quantifying this is an important result by
itself and that the construction of a null model can be problematic due to the inherent high regularity
in the data (i.e. comparison with time series obtained by a random redistribution of activity would not
be relevant for this in our opinion). We modified the presentation of these results in the text to be more
precise.
Reviewer’s response: “I think that it is a problem of terminology, the authors should maybe talk
about “typical activities”, “residual”, “quantify regularity” or “explained variability” more than “model”,
“performance” and “predictability” which are usually used to describe how a set of explanatory variables
can be used to estimate/predict a variable of interest.”
New response: We have further changed the presentation in the manuscript to clarify the concepts
and goals of the work. We hope that the new terminology in the updated manuscript is better aligned
with the work itself.
9) Original comment: “The correlation between zi and vi is clearly not significant. I recommend
the authors to add the correlation coefficient values and/or the Figure S13 in the main text.”
Original response: We now mention the correlation coefficient in the main text. We agree with the
reviewer that the Pearson correlation value of 0.20982 does not look very high; nevertheless, we argue
that given the high variance in the standardized predictability scores and the large number of points,
it can be considered significant here and thus warrants the use of the adaptive threshold described in
the text. We note that it is not easy to perform a formal hypothesis test for correlation here as it is
not clear how the degrees of freedom should be estimated. Fig. S13 contains a total several hundred
thousand points, but one could argue that those are not all independent; using a modest estimate of 289
(the number of days in the measurement period) for the degrees of freedom, the correlation value yields
a test statistic of t = 3.64 (for a Student t distribution) which still allows us to reject the null hypothesis
of independent variables at 0.1% confidence level.
Reviewer’s response: “Ok, but nevertheless, I recommend the authors to include the Figure S13
in the main text so that the reader can have a clear idea of what a relationship between two variables
“somewhat” correlated looks like.”
New response: We agree with the reviewer that this is an important part of the work; originally
we put the figure in the SI mainly due to space constraints in the manuscript. Now we moved it to the
main manuscript (as Fig. 9), while to limit the length of the main manuscript, we moved the previous
Fig. 10 (the one depicting residuals on the day of the Marathon race) to the SI (as Fig. S16) as we believe
that is not fundamental to the work presented, but more of an interesting application and illustration.
Ultimately, we leave it to the discretion of the editors whether to include Fig. S16 in the main text if the
manuscript is accepted for publication.
