This manuscript describes the use of a Lotka-Volterra modeling framework to try to decipher
complex changes in the networks of interactions between bacterial species that cause middle ear
infection (otitis media), in an animal model, when one of the bacterial species is replaced by a
gene knockout mutant. The reason this is useful is that such knockout studies are often used to
study what is going on in complex infections, but the results can be confusing as interactions can
be changed that are different from what is hypothesized. The authors write clearly and give a
comprehensive and clear description of their experiments and their modeling and analysis
methods. I do have some suggestions for how the manuscript could be made clearer or for other
things the authors might like to consider.
1. It would be helpful to define much earlier in the manuscript what is meant by weak and strong
effects. This is buried in the methods at present.
2. In several places a link is made with vaccine design. I would have appreciated more clarity on
this link. How does studying gene knockout mutants help with vaccine design?
3. For some gene knockouts it is suggested that a change in carrying capacity is expected. But it is
not clear how this would be accounted for in the modeling, which seems to only allow for
changes in the alpha parameters.
4. I wonder how well the "basic" Lotka Volterra model on which this work is based actually
works in predicting the dynamics of the wild type infection. I can imagine that such a simplified
model might struggle to be predictive, in which case one can wonder how useful it is for
understanding what is going on with the mutants.
5. In Methods, p.18, there is a statement that "H. influenzae would not grow on BHI plate...". But
counts are given for H. influenzae. It should be clarified how H. influenzae was counted.
6. The main Lotka Volterra model that is used here does not include the effects of the immune
system. But it is stated several times how important the immune system is, and later a way is
proposed to include the immune system in the LV model. Why is this more advanced model not
used for the main results analysis?
7. Looking at Table S1 and Fig 3, there is an absolutely massive variability in the results between
individual animals. The standard deviations for many of the counts are far larger than the means.
Doesn't this call into question the value of using such an averaged approach at all? Perhaps one
would do better to search for the causes of animal to animal variability?
8. Likewise the main results figure, Figure 4, seems to show questionable agreement between the
model (colored squares) and the data (dots) in some cases (eg A and B). The authors should at
least comment on why there is not better agreement here.

Authors present a maximum entropy based inference model to capture cross-correlation among
different bacterial strain. This is important since these correlations are rarely known a priori.
Systematic measurements require such modeling approach to quantitatively infer these
interdependencies. I like the goal of the work and recommend publication. However, I suggest
authors make the following revisions to make the work more clear, which was sometimes a bit
difficult to follow.
i) Authors mention about benchmarking the model using synthetic data. I understand synthetic
data has been generated using different alpha values. While performing the inference do we
collate all these data which leads to fluctuation in N_1, N_2 and hence the probabilistic
description of P(N_1,N_2) ? Otherwise, I am unable to follow the source of the fluctuations.
ii) Similarly, what would be the source of fluctuations when using in-vivo data ? Are we again
assuming there is some sort of variance in alpha parameters that lead to fluctuations in N_1, N_2
etc ? And the distribution in alpha is actually inferring this from the data ? Making it clear will

iii) Finally, could the origin of hidden correlation be due to steady state relation in equation (3) ?
It seems this relation stipulates dependence between alpha_22 and alpha_21, for example.
iv) Finally, the procedure seems similar to recent approaches to Gene network where effective
feedback parameters has been inferred between different types of genes. Mapping the bacterial
species by genes, the diagram in Figure 1 appears very similar to genetic Toggle switch solved

Reviewer#1
This manuscript describes the use of a Lotka-Volterra modeling
framework to try to decipher complex changes in the networks of
interactions between bacterial species that cause middle ear infection
(otitis media), in an animal model, when one of the bacterial species is
replaced by a gene knockout mutant. The reason this is useful is that
such knockout studies are often used to study what is going on in
complex infections, but the results can be confusing as interactions
can be changed that are different from what is hypothesized. The
authors write clearly and give a comprehensive and clear description
of their experiments and their modeling and analysis methods. I do
have some suggestions for how the manuscript could be made clearer
or for other things the authors might like to consider.
Thank you for the positive remarks. We have revised the manuscript to
address your comments.
1. It would be helpful to define much earlier in the manuscript what is
meant by weak and strong effects. This is buried in the methods at
present.
Added. See page 4. The relevant text is appended below.
“We define loss/gain of phenotype(s) in a specific mutant strain as a
weak regulator when the interactions between bacterial species in co-
infection experiments with the mutant strain are modified according to
changes in the phenotype(s) as hypothesized for the mutant strain. The
change in the phenotype(s) is defined as a strong regulator when
additional unanticipated interactions are altered in co-infection
experiments with the mutant strain. A more precise and formal
definition of the weak and strong regulators are provided in the
Materials and Methods section.”
2. In several places a link is made with vaccine design. I would have
appreciated more clarity on this link. How does studying gene
knockout mutants help with vaccine design?
Included. See page 15. The text addressing the above comment is
appended below.
“Isogenic mutant strains are used for identification of bacterial
determinants of colonization, persistence and virulence. Thus the
quantitative information obtained from our framework will be valuable
for determining specific targets for diagnostics, development of
therapy and, potentially vaccination.”
3. For some gene knockouts it is suggested that a change in carrying
capacity is expected. But it is not clear how this would be accounted
for in the modeling, which seems to only allow for changes in the
alpha parameters.
The carrying capacities are included effectively in the a parameters as
we describe in the Materials and the Methods section. We now add a
sentence to make this connection explicit (page 22). The relevant text
is appended below.
“Thus, the dependences of the carrying capacities {Ki} are effectively
contained in the scaled variables {aij}.”
4. I wonder how well the "basic" Lotka Volterra model on which this
work is based actually works in predicting the dynamics of the wild
type infection. I can imagine that such a simplified model might
struggle to be predictive, in which case one can wonder how useful it
is for understanding what is going on with the mutants.
We agree that this simple model cannot make predictions about
specific mechanisms, because all interactions are modeled in general
terms. This coarse-graining subsumes all interaction mechanisms,
known and unknown. Because the interactions outside a host are well
known, we attribute any unexpected changes to mechanisms that
manifest when the bacteria are in a host. With our method, it is
possible to make some claims about the nature of these otherwise
unknowable mechanisms, i.e. directionality and magnitude of the
mechanism. We agree that our method doesn't allow for more specific
claims; e.g. the concentration of immune factors. Nonetheless, our
method is useful, because without it, it's impossible to justify any
claims about these unknown mechanisms. Our model is useful in this
scenario to illuminate any changes in direction (positive or negative)
or severity/magnitude. A more detailed model would require more data
than is currently available. Also see our response to comment #6.
5. In Methods, p.18, there is a statement that "H. influenzae would not
grow on BHI plate...". But counts are given for H. influenzae. It should
be clarified how H. influenzae was counted.
Added additional details (page 18) in the revised manuscript to address
above point.
6. The main Lotka Volterra model that is used here does not include
the effects of the immune system. But it is stated several times how
important the immune system is, and later a way is proposed to
include the immune system in the LV model. Why is this more
advanced model not used for the main results analysis?
We sought for a minimal description of the intra- and inter- species
interactions between the two bacterial species in our framework where
the effects of the host immune response were subsumed in the LV
interaction parameters. This was done to have the minimum number of
parameters required to describe the system and then estimate the
parameter values from the data. The minimal description also provides
a clear definition of the interactions between the bacterial species in
terms of the LV parameters. Making the model more complex (e.g.,
by explicitly adding an immune response) would introduce additional
parameters and interactions which cannot be uniquely determined from
the small number of data points that are available from the in vivo
measurements. We have revised the text (page 21) to make this point
clear.
7. Looking at Table S1 and Fig 3, there is an absolutely massive
variability in the results between individual animals. The standard
deviations for many of the counts are far larger than the means.
Doesn't this call into question the value of using such an averaged
approach at all? Perhaps one would do better to search for the causes
of animal to animal variability?
The reviewer is correct in noticing large differences across animals in
the measured datasets. One of our main goals was to account for the
host-host variability of the measured bacterial abundances and then
assess its effect on the LV parameters. Therefore, in addition to the
average abundances, we included variances and covariances of the
measured data in our MaxEnt framework. The large host-host
variations could arise from various sources: from the host-host
differences of the immune response to the differences in the
physiology and anatomy of the upper respiratory tract in these animals.
In addition, these chinchillas are outbred, thus are likely to contain
more host-host variations compared to lab-bred animals. We have
added text to address this point (page 12).
8. Likewise the main results figure, Figure 4, seems to show
questionable agreement between the model (colored squares) and the
data (dots) in some cases (eg A and B). The authors should at least
comment on why there is not better agreement here.
We compared our prediction against the measured data in terms of
average populations as bacterial measurements were available for only
few animals. The individual data points shown on the graphs were not
explicitly compared, thus, some of the individual measurements (dots)
can lie at the boundaries of the predicted distribution (colored squares)
and need not reflect quality of comparison between the average
bacterial populations. We have mentioned this in the figure caption for
Fig. 4.

Comments to the Author(s)
Authors present a maximum entropy based inference model to capture
cross-correlation among different bacterial strain. This is important
since these correlations are rarely known a priori. Systematic
measurements require such modeling approach to quantitatively infer
these interdependencies. I like the goal of the work and recommend
publication. However, I suggest authors make the following revisions
to make the work more clear, which was sometimes a bit difficult to
follow.
Thank you for the positive remarks. We have revised the manuscript to
address your comments.
i) Authors mention about benchmarking the model using synthetic data.
I understand synthetic data has been generated using different alpha
values. While performing the inference do we collate all these data
which leads to fluctuation in N_1, N_2 and hence the probabilistic
description of P(N_1,N_2) ? Otherwise, I am unable to follow the
source of the fluctuations.
Yes, for the synthetic datasets we collate all alpha matrices to get
P(N_1, N_2) once this map from alpha space to N-space is made. We
have revised the text to make this clear (pages 29-30).
ii) Similarly, what would be the source of fluctuations when using in-
vivo data ?
The variations in the in vivo data can come from various sources: from
the host-host differences of the immune response to the differences in
the physiology and anatomy of the upper respiratory tract in these
animals. In addition, these chinchillas are outbred, thus are likely to
contain more host-host variations compared to lab-bred animals. We
have added text to address this point (page 12).
Are we again assuming there is some sort of variance in alpha
parameters that lead to fluctuations in N_1, N_2 etc ? And the
distribution in alpha is actually inferring this from the data ? Making
it clear will help.
Yes, we assumed that the host-host variations in the data (NTHi and
Mcat populations) arise in the model due to the variation of the alpha
parameters across animals. We have revised the text (pages 6-7) to
address this point.
iii) Finally, could the origin of hidden correlation be due to steady
state relation in equation (3) ? It seems this relation stipulates
dependence between alpha_22 and alpha_21, for example.
The correlations between the a parameters get contributions from three
sources: (i) the interdependence between them via Eq. (3), (ii) shape of
the distribution P(N1,N2), and, (iii) the stability criterion (supplemental
material section: Stability analysis) that ensures that the N1 (>0) and
N2 (>0) in Eq. (3) are stable fixed points of the kinetics in Eq. (1). We
added the above text to Supplemental Section 4.
iv) Finally, the procedure seems similar to recent approaches to Gene
network where effective feedback parameters has been inferred
between different types of genes. Mapping the bacterial species by
genes, the diagram in Figure 1 appears very similar to genetic Toggle
switch solved using Maximum Entropy like method [Firman et al J
Phys Chem B, 122, 5666 2018].
Thank you for pointing this recent paper out to us. We have referenced
it on page 23.
Overall it is an interesting idea that will be very useful to analyze data
of co-culture. The manuscript can be published after authors have
addressed the minor comments above.
Thank you for the positive remark. We hope you will find the revised
manuscript satisfying.
