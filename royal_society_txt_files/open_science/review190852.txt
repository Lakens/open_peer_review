1.This paper was introduced the six NZB phase I metabolites, formed by hydroxylation,
oxidation, and N-demethylation, were characterized.Using the LC-MS/MS metabolic profiling of
nazartinib, a novel anticancer drug, reveals the formation of unexpected reactive metabolites. All
of these Chemical compounds were qualitatived by LC-MS/MS. At the beginning, Do you make
some attempts to the test these chemical compounds by the GC-MS/MS? Because the GC-
MS/MS is better than LC-MS/MS in determine the chemical composition of a substance. By now
We can not search for relevant papers about the determination of the NZB and the relevant
metabolites. The EI and ESI were different, this result in the GC-MS/MS has the standard ion
library.
2. The Keywords. I think you had better add the LC-MS/MS.
3. The table 1. I suggest you to search for some analytical chemistry papers. Most of these were
written in the “Material and methods” for a Instrumentation by scripts.
4. The table 1. Gradient steps should be Gradients.
5. This paper “P2.03-012 Characterization of the Efficacies of Osimertinib and Nazartinib against
Cells Expressing Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutations. “ was early introduced the
Nazartinib against the Epidermal Mutations. Journal of Thoracic Oncology.K.Masuzawa

In general, These experiments have not been done before. But this paper should be carefully
revised.

referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

REVIEWER REPORT(S):
Reviewer 1
Dear reviewer:
We thank the reviewer for these pertinent questions and have addressed them all in
the revised manuscript.
Comments to the Author(s)
Title: Acceptable, author shouldn’t abbreviate liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry into LC-MS/MS following journal guidelines. LC-MS/MS should be
expanded.
We did as requested. We expanded LC-MS/MS into liquid chromatography tandem
mass spectrometry.
Abstract: Acceptable
Abbreviations should not be used in the abstract. Spare this abbreviation to first
appearance in the text. Abbreviations should be provided in a separate section.
We did as requested. We added a separate section for abbreviation.
Keywords: Acceptable
Remove chemotherapy from keywords.
We did as requested.
Introduction:
Separate paragraph should be included explaining the side effects of the formed
reactive metabolites with similar drugs in the literature.
We thank the reviewer for this recommendation. We added more information
regarding side effects of the formed reactive metabolites.
Methods:
1- Table 1 should be removed and all chromatographic conditions should be
mentioned in a text.
Table 1 was removed and we added a new section.
2- Model number of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments
should be mentioned.
We thank the reviewer for this recommendation. We did as requested.
3- Author should give more details on type of controls used in incubations.
We did as requested. Controls were prepared following the same steps except the
addition of the drug or NADPH.
4- In vitro and m/z should be italic all over the manuscript including text, figures
and schemes.
We did as requested.
Results:
1- Figures: Acceptable.
2- Schemes: acceptable, font should be unified and m/z should be italic.
We did as requested.
Conclusions: It should be concise as it contains duplication from the manuscript
sentences.
We rephrase the conclusion to be more concise.
References: Journal names should be abbreviated.
We did as requested. All journal names were abbreviated.

1.This paper was introduced the six NZB phase I metabolites, formed by
hydroxylation, oxidation, and N-demethylation, were characterized.Using the LC-
MS/MS metabolic profiling of nazartinib, a novel anticancer drug, reveals the
formation of unexpected reactive metabolites. All of these Chemical compounds
were qualitatived by LC-MS/MS. At the beginning, Do you make some attempts to
the test these chemical compounds by the GC-MS/MS? Because the GC-MS/MS is
better than LC-MS/MS in determine the chemical composition of a substance. By
now We cannot search for relevant papers about the determination of the NZB and
the relevant metabolites. The EI and ESI were different, this result in the GC-MS/MS
has the standard ion library.
We thank the reviewer for this comment.
Regarding GC-MS/MS:
1- We don't have GC-MS/MS in our laboratory.
2- There is no library for unknown metabolites with unknown chemical
structures.
3- LC-MS/MS is considered the standard technique for identification of unknown
metabolites.
2.The Keywords. I think you had better add the LC-MS/MS.
We added LC-MS/MS to keywords as requested.
3.The table 1. I suggest you to search for some analytical chemistry papers. Most of
these were written in the “Material and methods” for a Instrumentation by scripts.
We thank the reviewer for this recommendation.Table 1 was removed and replaced by
chromatographic separation section.
4.The table 1. Gradient steps should be Gradients.
The error was corrected as requested.
5.This paper “P2.03-012 Characterization of the Efficacies of Osimertinib and
Nazartinib against Cells Expressing Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutations. “
