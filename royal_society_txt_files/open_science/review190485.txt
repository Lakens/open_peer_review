The research seems interesting, but this paper is of low scientific quality, hence I can not support
its publication. Some important information is missing, references are also needed, there is no
discussion – pros and cons of this approach are not highlighted. Moreover, it seem that some
methodological flows exist. Its technical soundness must be improved. etc
If we start from the Introduction, my suggestion are as follows:
“The data available from THz measurements is generally never enough for BPNN or LS-SVM” –
Unclear.
References are needed for the statements made on PNN and GRNN in Introduction.
“GRNN can be used for regression, prediction and classification…” – The difference between
reg. and pred. is? Moreover, for classification is used GRNN counterpart, i.e. PNN.
“…approximately normal around the averaged value of 10.25%.” - Histogram with appropriate
test will be useful here.
“for modelling applicable model.” – You mean creation of?
“line fitted equation was established for investigating the relationship” – But no discussion is
provided on this.
PCA related results must be presented.
“The different PCA scores were selected as the input vector of GRNN model for investigating the
influence of different input dimensionalities, the results were shown in figure 4.” – You have
actualy change the number of PCs?
Fig 4 data - Is this obtained on test set? If so, this is not good practice, because the credibility of
test set is based on principle that it can not be used for model parameter determination. You
should use eugenvalues as criterion for PC relevancy.
“The larger the spread, the smoother the function approximation will be. Oppositely, the smaller
the spread, the stronger the approximation to the sample will be. “ - This is not actually the case,
and what the stronger approximation means?
“In this case, the method of circle training” – Details are needed.
In section 3.3. the GRNN results are not presented.
Fig 5. – What series 3 to 10 means?
“The best BPNN model was achieved with seven input vectors of PCA scores and six neurons of
hidden layer.” - You can not compare models with different inputs!
3
Fig 6. - What dataset was used to determine those meta-parameters?
And finally, GRNN results from figure 7 should be presented in section 3.3. In fig 7 keep only
BPNN results. Also, add table with performance metrics for those two models.
To conclude, the key flaw is that a third dataset is missing. You can not create a reliable ANN
without three dataset: training for weighs determination, validation for meta-parameters (e.g.
number of inputs or spread in GRNN and similar) determination, and test set to assess final
model. If you make multiple training runs until you get something that works best on the test
data, you have just rendered the test set as training one, and the model you chose as “the best “
will has to be tested once again on “unseen” data, because you've essentially created a ANN
model specifically for the test set.

This paper describes a method for the estimation of benzoic acid in wheat flour based on an
artificial neural networks (ANN) regression of terahertz spectroscopy data. This paper has some
critical problems and the most important are:
(i) The LOD (0.60%) of the methodology is markedly above the normal percentage values for BA
in wheat flour (0.05 to 0.1%).
(ii) The prediction set is indeed a test set. Several unknown samples must be assayed and the
results compared with those obtained with a standard method.
(iii) Fig. 3 must be discussed. Indeed, the response seems random and do show any observable
trend.
(iv) Why PCA was required as data pre-processing. What are the composition and shape of the
six components? Why PC Regression was not assessed or PLS?
(v) In the case of the ANN, how many iterations were used and what criteria were used to avoid
overfitting.

This paper describes the analysis of benzoic acid (BA) in wheat flour using terahertz spectroscopy
(TS) and principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Although the
subject of this paper may be useful, the work here presented is quite insufficient. The following
are the main critical points:
- Is the percentage of BA realistic in real applications? Indeed, up to 20% is a huge amount of BA!
Although in the paper, some figures show a concentration of BA up to 0,20%. The maximum
concentration was 20 or 0,20%?
- ANN works as a black box that needs optimization. For example, the number of layers, etc. But
also, the number of iterations needs to be monitored to avoid over-fitting. What optimization
strategy was used?
- The analytical methodology must be validated by the analysis of real samples and the results
must be compared with other results obtained by standard methodologies.

Appendix B
Comment: 1. “The data available from THz measurements is generally never enough
for BPNN or LS-SVM” – Unclear.
Response: The sentence had been deleted.
Comment: 2. References are needed for the statements made on PNN and GRNN in
Introduction.
Response: More introduction of GRNN had been added.
Comment: 3. “GRNN can be used for regression, prediction and classification…” –
The difference between reg. and pred. is? Moreover, for classification is used
GRNN counterpart, i.e. PNN.
Response: This part had been revised. GRNN is used for regression, and PNN is used
for classification.
Comment: 4. “…approximately normal around the averaged value of 10.25%.” -
Histogram with appropriate test will be useful here.
Response: The histogram had been added.
Comment: 5. “for modelling applicable model.” – You mean creation of?
Response: It has been changed into ‘for developing applicable model.
Comment: 6. “line fitted equation was established for investigating the relationship” –
But no discussion is provided on this.
Response: The discussion had been added as the following: According to this principle,
further investigation should be executed to mine THz spectra for accuracy improvement. For
Lambert Beer’s law, only the fingerprint peak can give a better relationship equation using
pretreatment liquid sample. In this case THz spectroscopy can’t obtain a high correlation
coefficient because the sample is relatively complex and only fingerprint peak can’t give enough
information. Therefore it requires more variables as the input vectors to improve the performance
of the models.
Comment: 7. PCA related results must be presented.
Response: The PCA related results had been added.
The number of input vectors will influence the architecture and performance of GRNN model.
Generally, the minimal architecture of GRNN is easy to obtain a better generalization of data
relation. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a bilinear modeling method which gives an
interpretable overview of the main information in a multidimensional data table. The information
carried by the original variables is projected onto a smaller number of underlying variables called
principal components. The first principal component covers as much of the variation in the data as
possible. The second principal component is orthogonal to the first and covers as much of the
remaining variation as possible, and so on. THz spectrum includes 300 spectral variables in range
of 0.5-3THz, and some variables may contain irrelevant information for regression. Therefore,
PCA was applied to transform original THz spectra into new axis and obtain the PCA scores as
new variables. The scores show the locations of the samples along each model component, and
can be used to detect sample patterns, groupings, similarities or differences. The score plots of
first and second principal components were shown in Figure 5. The distribution of the calibration
samples covered the validation and test ones.

Comment: 8. “The different PCA scores were selected as the input vector of GRNN
model for investigating the influence of different input dimensionalities, the results
were shown in figure 4.” – You have actualy change the number of PCs?
Response: The number of principal components and smooth factor were optimized.
The details were as following:
The number of input vectors and smooth factor (s) of RBF are two importance parameters that
influenced the performance of GRNN model. The principal component scores were chosen as
the input vectors of GRNN model. The number of principal components varied from one to ten.
The smooth factor, representing the spread of RBF, is another important index that affected the
performance of GRNN model. The larger the s, the smoother the function approximation will be.
Oppositely, the smaller the s, the stronger the approximation to the sample will be. In this case,
the method of circle training was adopted to optimize the spread in the range of 0.02-2, and the
interval was 0.02. The training and validation datasets were used to create GRNN model and
optimize the parameters, the results were shown in Figure 7. The optimal GRNN model was
obtained with 4 principal components and smooth factor of 0.4.

Figure 7. Optimization for number of principal components and smooth factor.
Comment: 9. Fig 4 data - Is this obtained on test set? If so, this is not good practice,
because the credibility of test set is based on principle that it can not be used for
model parameter determination. You should use eugenvalues as criterion for PC
relevancy.
Response: The datasets had been divided into training, validation and test sets. The
training and validation sets were used to create model and optimize parameters. And
test set was used to assess the model.
Comment: 10. “The larger the spread, the smoother the function approximation will
be. Oppositely, the smaller the spread, the stronger the approximation to the sample
will be. “ - This is not actually the case, and what the stronger approximation means?
Response: The smooth factor behaves as a regularization parameter of RBF. The s parameter
trades off correct prediction of training examples against maximization of the decision function’s
margin. For larger values of s, a smaller margin will be accepted if the decision function is better
at predicting all training points correctly. A lower s will encourage a larger margin, therefore a
simpler decision function, at the cost of training accuracy.
Comment: 11. “In this case, the method of circle training” – Details are needed.
Response: It has been added.
Comment: 12. In section 3.3. the GRNN results are not presented.
Response: It had been added.
Comment: 13. Fig 5. – What series 3 to 10 means?
Response: The spectra had been handled again, the Figure 5 has been delected.
Comment: 14. “The best BPNN model was achieved with seven input vectors of PCA
scores and six neurons of hidden layer.” - You can not compare models with
different inputs!
Response: I have processed the spectra again. The number of input vectors is the
same.
Comment: 15. Fig 6. - What dataset was used to determine those meta-parameters?
Response: The validation dataset was used to determine the meta-parameters.
Comment: 16. And finally, GRNN results from figure 7 should be presented in section
3.3. In fig 7 keep only BPNN results. Also, add table with performance metrics for
those two models.
Response: It had been added.
Comment: 17. To conclude, the key flaw is that a third dataset is missing. You can not
create a reliable ANN without three dataset: training for weighs determination,
validation for meta-parameters (e.g. number of inputs or spread in GRNN and similar)
determination, and test set to assess final model. If you make multiple training runs
until you get something that works best on the test data, you have just rendered the
test set as training one, and the model you chose as “the best “ will has to be tested
once again on “unseen” data, because you've essentially created a ANN model
specifically for the test set.
Response: The samples had been divided into training, validation and test datasets.
The spectra had been processed again.
Comment: 1. Section 2.3 is unclear and must be reformulated.
Response: This section had been rewritten.
A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was adopted to acquire the spectral distribution of the THz pulse
in the frequency. The sample’s absorption coefficient (a) could be calculated with eq. (1-2).

Comment: 2. Section 2.4 must be improved. The following papers may be a useful

Figure 1. The architecture of the GRNN.
Differencing from back propagation neural network (BPNN), GRNN is a variation to radial basis
neural networks, consists of four layers: input, pattern, summation and output layers [21-23].
Terahertz spectra are used as the input vectors in the first layer. The second layer has the pattern
units and the outputs of this layer are passed onto the summation units in the third layer. The final
layer covers the output units. Its architecture was shown in Figure. 1. GRNN replaces the sigmoid
activation function often used in ANN with a radial basis function (RBF) and achieves the
estimation of the probability density function using Parzen’s nonparametric estimator [15]. The
predicted value is simply a weighted average of the target values of training patterns close to the
given input pattern. The smoothing factor s, representing the width of RBF, is the only adjustable
parameter. The details of GRNN are as following:

Where Y(x) is the prediction value of input x, yk is the activation weight for the pattern layer
neuron at k, and K(x, xk) is the RBF as formulated above.
Comment: 3. The section Results and discussion must be completely reformulated
and the results must be presented in a clear manner, separately in the training and in
the validation phases.
Response: This section has been rewritten.

Comments:This paper describes the analysis of benzoic acid (BA) in wheat flour using terahertz
spectroscopy (TS) and principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN).
Although the subject of this paper may be useful, the work here presented is quite insufficient. The
following are the main critical points:
Response:We have collected new samples, recorded the spectra and developed model again.
Comments:- Is the percentage of BA realistic in real applications? Indeed, up to 20% is a huge
amount of BA! Although in the paper, some figures show a concentration of BA up to 0,20%. The
maximum concentration was 20 or 0,20%?
Response:We have collect samples again. The concentrations were from 0.08% to 1.14%. The
distribution is close to practical use.
Comments:- ANN works as a black box that needs optimization. For example, the number of
layers, etc. But also, the number of iterations needs to be monitored to avoid over-fitting. What
optimization strategy was used?
Response:We adapted training, validation and external testing datasets. For avoiding over-fitting,
early stop strategy was used as following:
he available data has been divided into the training and validation sets. The former is used for
computing the gradient and updating the network weights and biases. The latter is monitored
during the training process. The validation error normally decreases during the initial phase of
training, as does the training set error. However, when the network begins to over fit the data, the
error on the validation set typically begins to rise. When the validation error increases for a
specified number of iterations (net.trainParam.max_fail), the training is stopped, and the weights
and biases at the minimum of the validation error are returned.
Comments:- The analytical methodology must be validated by the analysis of real samples and
the results must be compared with other results obtained by standard methodologies
Response:For testing the model with real samples, we collected ten samples from a local oil and
food testing instrument. And these samples were used as external dataset fort testing the model
performance.
