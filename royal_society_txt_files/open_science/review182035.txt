The manuscript by Liu et al. majorly studied the production of a-keto acids using whole cells
entrapped in calcium alginate. Firstly, the well expressed recombinant strains were selected by
the comparison of different plasmids. Then the authors focused on the characterization of
PmiLAAO and preparation of a-keto acids from L-amino acid by the whole-cell biocatalyst.
Although 29.66 g/L of 2-oxo-3-phenylpropanoic acid was finally produced from the reactor, the
yield was still relatively low. Therefore, how to further increase the yield of a-keto acids?
Overall this manuscript represents a comprehensive study in the field of whole-cell biocatalysis.
It is acceptable for publication with some careful corrections. Some detail suggestions were given
as follows.
1. Fig. 3 showed that optimal pH of the recombinant enzyme was 6.5. However, as shown in
Scheme 1, NH3 produced from the reaction may change the pH of this particular system.
Discussion and explanation are needed.
2. In Line 25 and 28, errors of article style appeared and need to be corrected.
3. In Line 148, 2 g/L of whole cell biocatalyst might be too little in quantity. It would be
persuasive if the experimental data of optimal wet cell weight was given.
4. In Table 1, the Km of PmiLAAO was the highest in the list. Accordingly, low Km means high
affinity for substrate. The authors need to give more discussion to explain the reason of choosing
PmiLAAO.
5. In Line 188 and 271, the same error appeared as comment 2 and needs to be corrected.

The authors demonstrated simple continuous bio-approach for effective production of a-keto
acids by immobilized E. coli-pETduet-1-PmiLAAO in a jacketed packed-bed reactor. The
recycling experiments and different substrates study added the value to the work. The
manuscript is well written, systematic, and quality of the article is good in my opinion. After
reading the whole manuscript, I suggest acceptance of the manuscript after the following minor
revisions:
1) In introduction, in line 43, authors should provide abbreviation of TCA cycle, necessary for
common readers.
2) Table 4. Comparison of 2-oxo-3-phenylpropanoic acid production efficiency, authors can

For your guidance, itemized answers to reviewer’s comments is appended below
(answers are in blue font).
Reviewer: 1
(1) The manuscript by Liu et al. majorly studied the production of a-keto acids
using whole cells entrapped in calcium alginate. Firstly, the well expressed
recombinant strains were selected by the comparison of different plasmids. Then
the authors focused on the characterization of PmiLAAO and preparation of
a-keto acids from L-amino acid by the whole-cell biocatalyst. Although 29.66
g/L of 2-oxo-3-phenylpropanoic acid was finally produced from the reactor, the
yield was still relatively low. Therefore, how to further increase the yield of
a-keto acids? Overall this manuscript represents a comprehensive study in the
field of whole-cell biocatalysis. It is acceptable for publication with some
careful corrections.
A: Thanks for your kind suggestion.We speculate that there may be asubstrate
inhibition or product inhibition hindering the improvement of a-keto acids yield.
In order to further increase the yield of a-keto acids, we are trying our best to
eliminate theproduct inhibitionand enhance the substrate affinityby means of
protein engineering. The work of pmiLAAO gene mutation based on molecular
docking and molecular dynamics is underway. “In order to further increase the
yield of a-keto acids, we are trying our best to eliminate the product inhibition
and enhance the substrate affinity by means of protein engineering.” has been
added in the revised manuscript (Page 12, Line 285-287).
(2) Fig. 3 showed that optimal pH of the recombinant enzyme was 6.5. However, as
shown in Scheme 1, NH3 produced from the reaction may change the pH of this
particular system. Discussion and explanation are needed.
A:Thanks for your kind suggestion.The pH of the aqueous phase containing unreacted
amino acids (substrate) had been adjusted to 6.5 before recycling. The step of pH
adjusting has been added into the Revised Figures and Tables (Page 1, Scheme 1;
Page 4, Fig.6). “The pH of the aqueous phase containing unreacted amino acids
(substrate) had been adjusted to 6.5 before recycling.” has been added in the
Revised Figures and Tables (Page 1, Scheme 1; Page 4, Fig.6).
(3) In Line 25 and 28, errors of article style appeared and need to be corrected.
A: Thanks for your kind suggestion. Errors of article style has been corrected in the
revised manuscript (Page 1-2, Line 25-28), including "130 %" has been changed
to "130%"; "5–40 <U+25E6>C " has been changed to "5–40<U+25E6>C "; " pH of 5.0 - 8.0" has
been changed to " pH of 5.0-8.0"; "Furthermore, the PmiLAAO was stable at
5–40<U+25E6>C and pH of 5.0-8.0, the optimal pH and temperature of recombinant
PmiLAAO were 6.5 and 37oC, respectively." has been changed to "Furthermore,
The PmiLAAO was stabile in the pH range of 4.0–9.0 and in the temperature
range of 10–40<U+25E6>C; The optimal pH and temperature of recombinant PmiLAAO
were 6.5 and 37oC, respectively"
(4) In Line 148, 2 g/L of whole cell biocatalyst might be too little in quantity. It
would be persuasive if the experimental data of optimal wet cell weight was
given.
A: Thanks for your kind suggestion. 2 g/L of whole cell biocatalyst was used for
functional screening of the biocatalysts. The experimental data of optimal
whole-cell biocatalyst loading has been added in the Revised Figures and Tables
(Page 3, Fig. 5 D). "The conversion of L-Phe was up to 98 %, while the
whole-cell biocatalyst loading was 40 g/L (Fig. 5D)" has been added in the
revised manuscript (Page 9, Line 212-215).
(5) In Table 1, the Km of PmiLAAO was the highest in the list. Accordingly, low
Km means high affinity for substrate. The authors need to give more discussion
to explain the reason of choosing PmiLAAO.
A: Thanks for your kind suggestion. Km value was obtained from Enzyme
Database -BRENDA (measured by different researchers). In the present study,
the Km values was just used as reference to obtain the source of LAAO."
However, many of LAAO gene sequences with lower Km value (including
NcLAAO, PreLAAO, ThLAAO, HsLAAO, CatLAAO) were failed to be
accessed from the GenBank database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/).
NoLAAO, CrLAAO, CadLAAO, MgLAAO, PmiLAAO, RoLAAO and
DrLAAO with available sequence data were selected as the candidates.
Afterwards, pET20b-NoLAAO, pET20b-CrLAAO, pET20b-CadLAAO,
pET20b-MgLAAO, pET20b-PmiLAAO, pET20b-DrLAAO, and
pET20b-RoLAAO were constructed and transformed into the expression host E.
coli BL21 (DE3), subsequently." has been added in the revised manuscript
(Page 7, Line 161-169). "Unfortunately, the NoLAAO, CrLAAO, CadLAAO,
MgLAAO, and DrLAAO showed no amino acid oxidase activity. Of those, the
amino acid oxidase activity of E. coli BL21 (pET20b -RoLAAO) and E. coli
BL21 (pET20b -PmiLAAO) were 1.1 U/mL and 1.8 U/mL, respectively.
Therefore, the E. coli BL21 (pET20b -PmiLAAO) showing highest activity
was selected for further study instead of the pET20b -RoLAAO (Fig. 1)." has
been added in the revised manuscript (Page 7, Line 170-175).
(6) In Line 188 and 271, the same error appeared as comment 2 and needs to be
corrected.
A: Thanks for your kind suggestion. Errors of article style has been corrected in the
revised manuscript (Page 8-11, Line 188-271), including "37 <U+25E6>C " has been changed
to "37<U+25E6>C "; " 50 %" has been changed to " 50%"; "> 97.5 % enantiomeric excess
(ee)" has been changed to " > 97.5% enantiomeric excess (ee)"; " (ee > 99 %)" has
been changed to "(ee>99%)"; " The PmiLAAO was stabile within a pH range of
4.0–9.0 and at a temperature range of 10–40<U+25E6>C " has been changed to " The
PmiLAAO was stabile in the pH range of 4.0–9.0 and in the temperature range of
10–40<U+25E6>C"(Page 8, Line 188-189).
