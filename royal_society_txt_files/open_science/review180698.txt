I think the authors have made a lot of effort to revise the manuscript acoording to all the
reviewrs' suggestions. Nevertheless, I do have some suggestions and comments on this
manuscript that I think would help to increase the impact of this manuscript. A minor revision is
required before it can be accepted for publication.
1. There is a problem in figure S2 that needs to be examined carefully, such as “Fe”.
2. Clear scanning electron micrograph of the Sb2Te3-Te nanocomposite should be provided.

“A facile energy-saving route of fabricating thermoelectric Sb2Te3-Te nanocomposites and
nanosized Te”
Author mentioned in the title and inside the manuscript that it is the energy saving method. But
practically I did not find the reason of energy saving?. The materials was prepared at by heating
it 400°C. Author also prepared the materials following by the same method of the ref. paper
Green Chem. 2016, 18, 5288-5294. So, the novelty of the preparation method is questionable.
3
Furthermore, to prepare the materials, 400°C was applied. Thus, it can’t be called as energy
saving method. Additionally, a lot of mistakes were found in the manuscript. As for example,
i. Figure S2. Power X-ray. It should be Powder X-ray
ii. Figures are not marked on pages 27, 29, 30, and 31
iii. Author mentioned in page number 3 at the end of introduction part the the prepared materials
are nanopowder. But I did not find any images of SEM or TEM that are showing it is Nano
powder. Author should provide high resolution FESEM images to confirm the prepared materials
are nanopowder. The image on page number 29 is very un-clear. It can’t indicate produced
materials are nanopowder. Other formula by XRD is not acceptable to show the particles size.
iv. Introduction of the paper is not well written. It looks like they wrote result and discussion part
in the first section of introduction. But in this part background research should be discussed.
So, over all my suggestion is rejection.

“A facile energy-saving route of fabricating thermoelectric
Sb2Te3-Te nanocomposites and nanosized Te”
Author mentioned in the title and inside the manuscript that it
is the energy saving method. But practically I did not find the
reason of energy saving?. The materials was prepared at by
heating it 400°C. Furthermore, to prepare the materials, 400°C
was applied. Thus, it can’t be called as energy saving method.
[response] The fabrication route not only avoid the use of organic
substance but also keep energy consumption to a minimum. The
electricity consumption of fabricating Sb2Te3-Te nanocomposites in this
work is 2.8 kWh. Most of other works either invlolve complicated
procedures with organic stuff or lengthy heating duration. Besides, there
is no way so far Sb2Te3 can be synthesized without heating at all.
i. Figure S2. Power X-ray. It should be Powder X-ray
[response] The typo is corrected in the revised manuscript.
ii. Figures are not marked on pages 27, 29, 30, and 31
[response] In fact, figure captions were included in the figure
captions section
in the manuscript. For some reason, they are not
shown in the pdf
file for review. Anyway, Figure captions are
provided for
corresponding figures.
iii. Author mentioned in page number 3 at the end of
introduction part the the prepared materials are
nanopowder. But I did not find any images of SEM or TEM
that are showing it is Nano powder. Author should provide
high resolution FESEM images to confirm the prepared
materials are nanopowder. The image on page number 29 is
very un-clear. It can’t indicate produced materials are
nanopowder. Other formula by XRD is not acceptable to show
the particles size.
[response] Thank the refer for the comment. A new and clear
Fe-SEM image
is given in the revised manuscript. The new FE-
SEM image is
shown below. This image clearly shows as-
synthesized precursors
are nanopowders. Besides, the TEM image also clear
shows the
nanograin nature after consolidation.
The new FE-SEM image is given as follows.
iv. Introduction of the paper is not well written. It looks like
they wrote result and discussion part in the first section of
introduction. But in this part background research should be
discussed.
[response] About the background of thermoelectric materials,
we have
added several paragraphs in the introduction in the
revised
manuscript which are shown in red as follows.
Fig. 1 shows the thermoelectric circuit consisting of two junctions
with each junction connected by two dissimilar conductors. Based on
the thermoelectric phenomena, there are five effects operating
simultaneously in the circuit, namely, the Seebeck, Peltier, Thomson,
Joule, and Fourier effects [1]. The Seebeck effect is an electromotive
force (emf) generated in the circuit by the temperature gradient across
two junctions (one hot junction and the other cold junction), which can
be utilized to make thermoelectric generators (TEG). TEG can be used
to recover waste thermal energy and supply electricity for electronic
devices such as fans, mobile phones, lights, radios, and microsensors in
areas where electric power is not available. Besides, the solar
thermoelectric generators using solar heat as heat source can be stored
in energy storage materials [2-4]. The Peltier effect is the reverse
thermoelectric phenomenon of the Seebeck effect. The Peltier effect is
one junction in the circuit becoming colder with its heat transferred to
the other junction becoming hotter when an electrical current flows
through the circuit, which can be utilized to make solid-state
thermoelectric cooler (TEC). TEC can be used in a wide range of
applications such as food and beverage cooling, black box cooling,
constant temperature controlling, dehumidifying, cold plates, on-board
refrigeration, electronics packaging cooling, and semiconductor wafer
probes. The Thomson effect is the generation or absorption of heat for
a single current-carrying conductor along its length in the presence of
temperature gradient. The Joule effect is the Joule heat generated when
an electrical current flows through a conductor. The Fourier effect is the
conductive heat transfer between two junctions with temperature
difference. Thermoelectric devices are based on these five effects acting
in combination and involving interactions between the heat flow and
electric charge flow through solid bodies. Thermoelectric materials are
used to fabricate thermoelectric modules for thermal energy conversion
to direct current electricity via the Seebeck effect and solid-state
refrigerators via the Peltier effect.
Thermoelectric modules are made of p- and n-type
thermoelectric materials. To evaluate whether a material is a good
thermoelectric material candidate, dimensionless figure of merit zT
is adopted as a criterion. The value of zT is expressed by
<U+0001D70E><U+0001D446> 2
<U+0001D467>T = , (1)
<U+0001D705>
where <U+F073>, S, <U+F06B><U+F02C><U+F020>and T are<U+F020>the<U+F020>electrical conductivity, thermopower (or
Seebeck coefficient),<U+F020> total thermal conductivity, and absolute
temperature, respectively. The total thermal conductivity <U+F06B> is comprised
of the electronic thermal conductivity (<U+F06B>e) and the lattice thermal
conductivity (<U+F06B>lattice), that is, <U+F06B> = <U+F06B>e + <U+F06B>lattice. Therefore, a material with
high electrical conductivity, large thermopower and low thermal
conductivity would lead to high zT values. For TEG, the power
generation efficiency <U+F068>TE is expressed as [1]
<U+F0E6> <U+F0F6>
<U+F0E7> <U+F0F7>
<U+F0E6> TH <U+F02D> TC <U+F0F6><U+F0E7> 1 <U+F02B> ZTM <U+F02D> 1 <U+F0F7>,
<U+F068> TE <U+F03D> <U+F0E7><U+F0E7> <U+F0F7><U+F0F7> (2)

where TM = (TH+TC)/2 is the mean temperature; TH and TC are the
temperatures of heat source and heat sink, respectively. For TEC, the
coefficient of performance (COP) <U+F066> is given as [1]
1
(<U+0001D446><U+0001D443> -<U+0001D446><U+0001D441> )<U+0001D43C><U+0001D447><U+0001D436> -<U+0001D43E><U+0394><U+0001D447>- <U+0001D43C> 2 <U+0001D445>
