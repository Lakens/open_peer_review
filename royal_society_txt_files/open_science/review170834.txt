The authors investigated adsorption and photocatalysis for MO and Cd ion
removal using TiO2/sewage sludge-based activated carbon composites, and the material
characterizations were performed. Though this manuscript is mainly a phenomenological study
without deep mechanism understanding, it could be a contribution to the literature.

From Fig.3, it’s not OK to claim the material as “nanocomposites”.

The authors employ sewage sludge to prepare activated carbon for compositing with TiO2. The
adsorption and photocatalytical efficiency seems to be good. The influence of pH value, initial
concentrations and irradiation time were comprehensively investigated. The following comments
need to be addressed before its acceptance.
(1) The authors should clarify the advantages by employing sewage sludge as the raw materials
for activated carbon.
(2) Is the composition of sewage sludge or the prepared activated carbon controllable?
(3) It is also important to give a detailed discussion by comparing their results with the reported
TiO2/activated carbon obtained from other raw materials.
(4) Silica was included in the final composites. The authors should clarify the effect of silica in this
work.

The reviewer needs to know how “the average particle size of the TiO2 nanoparticles
were between 15.2 to 29 nm” was calculated.
The authors said that “This organic substance is the main factor in the production of activated
carbon from sewage sludge.” However, from Table 1, several metal element with significant
amount exist in the composite (TiO2/ASS). Thus, how could the author said that it’s a “sewage
sludge-based activated carbon composites”?

Fig.1, it’s not clear at all and there was no the power information on the lamp.
The power of UV lamp : 20-watt germicidal UV lamp
(I cited it in Fig.1 and in the text)
P3, L50, the solution pH, which was adjusted with (1N) NaOH or HCl should be
specified.
All the batch experiments were carried out in a Pyrex conical beaker (100 ml) at
room temperature under mechanical stirring (150 rpm). In batch experiments the pH
values of the sample solution were adjusted with 1N HCl or 1N NaOH , and measured
by pH meter .

From Fig.3, it’s not OK to claim the material as “nanocomposites”.
Nanocomposite is named on the base of TiO2 particle. TiO2 nanoparticle (in white
sponge) appears in the pictures in a large; because the pictures were with high
resolution 1,300-10µm. The calculated average particle size of the TiO2 nanoparticles
were between 15.2 to 29 nm .

(1) The authors should clarify the advantages by employing sewage sludge as the raw
materials for activated carbon.
Sewage sludge , a cheap waste by-product from wastewater treatment plant, was
used for the production of activated carbon . Urban sewage sludge is mainly
composed of organic and inorganic substance that contains a variety of fungi and
protozoa constitute ( 60%~70%). This organic substance is the main factor in the
production of activated carbon from sewage sludge. The activated carbon can be
made of residual activated sludge through high temperature carbonization and
activation, or by chemical activation.
(I cited it in the text)
(2) Is the composition of sewage sludge or the prepared activated carbon
controllable?
Yes, Table 1 presented the composition of both sewage sludge (AAS), and the
composite (TiO2/ASS).
(3) It is also important to give a detailed discussion by comparing their results with
the reported TiO2/activated carbon obtained from other raw materials.
Several researches prepared activated carbon in TiO2/activated carbon
composite from different raw materials and applied it for the removal of methyl
orange dye and Cd. For Cd adsorption, Sharaf El-Deena and Zhanga [23] prepared
TiO2/sewage sludge (TS) as biomass material and found that the adsorption removal
Cd was 74% removal. Modified fly ash was used for the preparation of TiO2/activated
carbon and used for the removal of 82% Cd from polluted solution[19]. Visa and Duta
[24] applied Modified fly ash (FA) mixed with TiO2 photocatalyst for simultaneous
removal of Methyl orange and Cadmium. The removal of MO and Cd by TiO2/ASS
photocatalyst was 94.28 and 93.67 %, respectively. These results were less than our
finding. Carbon foam-loaded nano-TiO2 photocatalyst was prepared as used for
photodegradation of MO dye with removal percent by 83–87% [25] . Carbonized
cotton T-shirt loaded nano-TiO2 photocatalyst was examined by the degradation of
methyl orange up to 98.6% [26]. These results were near our finding.
orange up to 98.6% (Yang et al.,2016). These results were near our finding.
(I cited it in the text)
(4) Silica was included in the final composites. The authors should clarify the effect
of silica in this work.
Sewage sludge contains silica, which not changed when paralyzed to sewage sludge
activated carbon (AAS) ,and so it appears in the composition of the prepared TiO2/
ASS nanocomposite. Silica (SiO2) as a part of sewage sludge activated carbon act as
an effective adsorbent site on the surface of TiO2/ ASS for the adsorption of MO dye
and Cd. The developed new active sites (SiO-) on TiO2/ ASS surface, allowing Cd 2+
to form complexes on the surface [27]as described below:
2(=SiO-) + Cd2+ <U+2192> ((=Si-O )2Cd
The TiO2 based compounds on the TiO2/ ASS surface is expected to host similar
processes. On the TiO2/ ASS, simultaneous processes of adsorption and
photocatalysis will be developed, according to the below equation :

1-The reviewer needs to know how “the average particle size of the TiO2 nanoparticles were between 15.2 to

Authors: Thanks.
The average particle size of the TiO2 nanoparticles calculated from the half-width of the diffraction lines in
XRD pattern using the Scherrer’s equation was between 15.2 to 29 nm.
We cited it in the text with the reference number [22], and highlighted by green color.
2-The authors said that “This organic substance is the main factor in the production of activated carbon from
sewage sludge.” However, from Table 1, several metal element with significant amount exist in the composite
(TiO2/ASS). Thus, how could the author said that it’s a “sewage sludge-based activated carbon composites”?
Authors
Thanks to the reviewer for this good comment. The analysis of composite (TiO2/ASS) (Table 1) shows only the
contents of metal oxides, but not the non-metals (C,O,H,N,S) which include carbon. It is known that sewage
sludge contains, beside the metals, the non-metals (C,O,H,N,S) and so the carbon content in the composite
was the source of the activated carbon in it.
