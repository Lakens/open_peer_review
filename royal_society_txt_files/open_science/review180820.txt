The goal of this manuscript is to develop a quantitative method for characterizing the shape of
yeast colonies with pseudohyphal growth. The method is called “Clustered Shape Primitives”
(CSP) and consists of k-means clustering shape primitive vectors measured around colony
boundaries. The method is validated by analyzing binarized yeast colony images from a recent
paper with 3 yeast strains exposed to different nutrient conditions. The new method can classify
the yeast colonies by strain, by nutrient concentration, or by both.
The method seems to be valid and useful. Therefore, I would like to recommend publication
provided that the following comments are addressed:
(1) Introduction: it would be worth adding “commonly known as” in the first sentence: “Yeasts
are commonly known as single-celled fungi”. Research have actually indicated that yeasts exhibit
multicellular behaviors.
(2) In the PLoS Computational Biology paper (reference [7]) a few illustrative cases with random
points in a disk or annulus or 4 symmetrically positioned squares are provided. Applying CSP to
the same shapes would be useful.
(3) While the method is validated by comparison with the measures in the earlier Binder et al.
study applied to the same yeast colonies, it would also be useful to also apply some other metrics
on the same colonies, such as P2A or colony boundary variance from Reference [10].
(4) A possibly related point: The Discussion states that “The method proposed here does not
include a matching step to identify points between shapes, and only local features are considered,
rather than the overall shape. Consequently, other methods do not apply to the data set under
consideration, and our method does not apply to standard data sets used in other shape studies.
As such, rather than test the method against standard techniques or databases, we have
compared the classification power of CSPs to that of the indices developed by Binder et al. [7].
The CSPs generally provided greater discriminatory power than the spatial indices.” This
statement is not completely clear. It should be clarified for the general reader.

label_comment_2
The manuscript by Gontar et al. presents a shape-based approach for quantification of yeast
colonies. They present clustered shape primitives for characterizing individual colony shapes,
and use spatial indices for comparison and for combined quantitative representation. All
experimental results presented demonstrate very high accuracies, suggesting that the
classification task is quite trivial and that the presented method successfully captures differences
in the colonies under these experimental conditions.
A few minor comments:
-In 2 (d): "For each image that was left out, the single best feature for classifying that image was
chosen by exhaustive search."
This leaves me puzzled - in LOOCV one would expect that only the training samples are used for
tuning the classifier parameters, in this case, for selecting the features. The sample that is left out
is only used for testing the classifier accuracy. Could this part be clarified, what exactly was done
then the single best feature was chosen by exhaustive search?
-In results, "angle" could be more directly linked to the mathematical representation of the shape
features.
-How can angle of the distance direction be a major contributing factor in features discriminating
the colonies, could the authors elaborate more on what this means?
My main criticism is pointed to the experimental setup. The title suggests that the method is for
characterizing shape patterns. Surely classification is one way of measuring the efficiency of the
quantitative representation. But in this case, the experimental setup does not seem to provide
much challenge - I really doubt that a shape-only approach would yield to such (almost) perfect
classification accuracy when faced with more challenging colony types, e.g., cases where filament
length is not the dominant pattern characterizing the colonies. Is this approach able to
characterize such cases, and if not, why would this contribution be important as there are others
where the shape, morphology and texture have been quantitatively characterized using a much
wider panel of features?

While the method is validated by comparison with the measures in the earlier Binder et

ere P is P2A, and PM is the maximum value of P2A across all yeast colony images considered
the study. Dividing by PM ensures that 0 = P = 1, and dividing by M ensures that all
tures are of the same magnitude. There was no need to repeat the feature analysis method
cause this involved CSPs only. The results of this analysis are summarised here and given in
l in the appendix to this response.
r the training and testing experiments, the feature P/M PM was never chosen as a best
ture. The values of D and K that result in the best classification result have not changed.
r LOOCV, the feature P/M PM was chosen as a best feature more often than either the
dial, angular, or angular pair-correlation indices. Although P2A appears to have some
criminatory power, including this feature did not improve the classification results during
OCV because, for each image that was left out, there was already a feature that had
ssified it correctly.
erall, incorporating P2A as a feature did not improve the classification. This can be
plained, in part, by comparing P2A with the indices used in the paper, as shown in figure 2.
hile P2A and the indices each measure different quantities, these all display the same
alitative behaviour and are highly correlated. Because of this, and for the purposes of clarity,
have not added the results including P2A to the manuscript. Instead, we have commented
section 2(d) on how this quantity, and others, provide similar information to the spatial
ices and do not improve the classification. We have included the results of this appendix as
pplementary material.
e boundary variance is computed from a polar representation of the boundary with the radius
xpressed as a function of angle <U+03B8>. The boundary variance is defined to be the coefficient
variation of r(<U+03B8>). To the best of our knowledge, r(<U+03B8>) is a function for the colonies from
erence 10 because it takes a unique value of r for each value of <U+03B8>. In contrast, the colonies
nsidered here are much more irregular in shape, so r(<U+03B8>) can take on multiple values for a
en <U+03B8> and is thus not a function. It thus no longer makes sense to compute the coefficient of
riation. The index I<U+03B8> taken from reference 7 is computed by sampling points from the colony,
mputing the angle <U+03B8>, and computing a normalised count f<U+03B8> of these values. This effectively
ovides a method for representing the boundary shape as a function of angle for a colony
th an irregular boundary. The index I<U+03B8> taken from reference 7 is defined to be the sum
coefficients from the Fourier transform of f<U+03B8> , which can be shown to be equivalent to the
riance of f<U+03B8> . We thus believe that I<U+03B8> provides the same information as the boundary variation
m reference 10. We have added a comment on this to section 2(c) of the manuscript.
A possibly related point: The Discussion states that “The method proposed here does
include a matching step to identify points between shapes, and only local features are
sidered, rather than the overall shape. Consequently, other methods do not apply to the

k-means clustering is one approach to dimensionality reduction. Could other methods (such
PCA) be considered in the future?
hile this is possible, there are two reasons for not recommending PCA. One reason is that
means clustering is not used to reduce the dimension of the data in this paper. Here, the
w measurements form shape primitives of dimension D corresponding to the number of
ections in which local thickness is measured. K-means clustering serves to transform the
ape primitive data nonlinearly into features (CSPs) that correspond to frequently occurring
ape patterns. The dimension of the transformed data is K. Typical values are D = 4 and
= 10, and so k-means clustering increases the dimension of the data. The other reason is
at PCA is not optimal for feature selection prior to classification. PCA is useful for finding
e direction (eigenvector) of greatest information content. By selecting a few eigenvectors
rresponding to the largest eigenvalues, PCA may be used to reduce the dimensionality of
ta while retaining the greatest information content. However, the direction of greatest
ormation content is not necessarily the direction of optimal classification, as shown by the
ificial example in figure 3. We have added a comment on this to the manuscript at the end
section 2(b).

esponse to Reviewer #2
e thank the reviewer for providing constructive comments on our work, and we have
dressed the concerns raised as indicated below. Changes are highlighted in colour on the
ised manuscript.
e manuscript by Gontar et al. presents a shape-based approach for quantification of yeast
onies. They present clustered shape primitives for characterizing individual colony shapes,
use spatial indices for comparison and for combined quantitative representation. All experi-
ntal results presented demonstrate very high accuracies, suggesting that the classification task
uite trivial and that the presented method successfully captures differences in the colonies
er these experimental conditions.
ew minor comments:
2 (d): “For each image that was left out, the single best feature for classifying that image was
sen by exhaustive search.” This leaves me puzzled - in LOOCV one would expect that only
training samples are used for tuning the classifier parameters, in this case, for selecting the
tures. The sample that is left out is only used for testing the classifier accuracy. Could this
t be clarified, what exactly was done then the single best feature was chosen by exhaustive
rch?

agree that this description requires clarification. Let S denote the number of images in a
ta set. A single image was removed from the training data and set aside as the test image.
e remaining S - 1 images were used to determine the single best feature for classification
exhaustively testing each feature separately. The resulting classifier was used to classify
e test image. This classification was either correct or incorrect. By repeating this process,
luding the feature selection step, S times with each image taking a turn as the test image, a
ssification result was obtained for each image. The accuracy was taken to be the proportion
images classified correctly. The number of times each spatial index was chosen as the best
ture was also recorded. We have revised the text of section 2(d) to reflect this.
results, “angle” could be more directly linked to the mathematical representation of the
pe features.
have added a comment to section 2(b) discussing the meaning of the distribution of angles
a shape primitive, and a new figure (figure 3) has been included to illustrate how distances
measures at different angles. Additional information has been added throughout the results
tion 3(a) (pages 7, 8, 10) to emphasise the connection between angles an the mathematical
resentation of the shape features. We have also made some clarifications to last paragraph
section 3, which discusses the angle.
w can angle of the distance direction be a major contributing factor in features discriminating
colonies, could the authors elaborate more on what this means?
e distribution of line segments lengths within the object <U+2126> at various orientations fd ,
= 1, 2, . . . d, allows discrimination between shapes. In the context of yeast colonies, if all the
eudohyphae consist of straight radial spikes of the same length, then the distribution of line
ment lengths would be a uniform function of fd . The distribution of line segment lengths at
rious orientations, regardless of the frame of reference, provides a measure of the deviation
m this model. In other words, it is not the orientation of a single line segment that matters,
is the distribution of these that defines shape patterns. We have added a comment on this
section 2(b).
main criticism is pointed to the experimental setup. The title suggests that the method is
characterizing shape patterns. Surely classification is one way of measuring the efficiency
he quantitative representation. But in this case, the experimental setup does not seem to
vide much challenge - I really doubt that a shape-only approach would yield to such (almost)
fect classification accuracy when faced with more challenging colony types, e.g., cases where
ment length is not the dominant pattern characterizing the colonies. Is this approach able
characterize such cases, and if not, why would this contribution be important as there are
ers where the shape, morphology and texture have been quantitatively characterized using a
ch wider panel of features?

e reviewer is correct that there is no reason to use a shape only approach if full grey scale
ormation is available. Yeast colony data is available as binary images, making it of interest
develop methods to quantify such data (Binder, Sundstrom, Gardner, Jiranek and Oliver,
15, reference 7 from the manuscript). This method would not supersede methods where
ferent data is available. Although the method was tuned to the specific attributes of the
ta motivating this study, there are many situations where shape only data is the natural
ting. This is the case when analysing three-dimensional objects that are locally so irregular
shape that standard geometric descriptions are not practical. An example is the trabecular
ucture of cancellous bone (Martin and Bottema, 2015, reference 15 from the manuscript).
