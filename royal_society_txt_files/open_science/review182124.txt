This article maps the space of US job titles to identify which sectors contain workers who are (1)
susceptible to automation and (2) stuck without a pathway to alternative employment. For
example, the author finds that occupations in both the Business and Industrial sectors may be
susceptible to automation but the Industrial sector on the whole has less connectivity to other
sectors. This type of result may inform our understanding of technological change and job
polarization in the US. I love this idea, and I believe there is great value in performing this
analysis well.
I have a few major concerns with this article.
(1) The author's interpretation of the edge weights in the job network are not validated strongly
enough for the interpretation the author assigns to them. The author proposes a single measure
for the skill similarity between a pair of jobs and considers this similarity as a proxy for workers'
ability to transition between those occupations without showing that these scores are even
correlated with worker career mobility. Despite what the author says in the Limitations section,
data does exist to approximate this. One possibility is to access resume data. Another possibility
is to use data from the Current Population Survey, which is a data product of the US Census
Bureau. Comparing the edge weights with actual rates of workers transitioning between
occupation pairs would strengthen the author's interpretation of the job network.
(2) Similar to (1), the author should validate their measures for connectivity between sectors
against empirical data reflective of actual worker transitions. The author's use of job growth per
sector offers an indirect validation, and I believe a more direct validation is possible.
(3) This study relies entirely on the automation estimates from the Frey & Osborne study, but this
study is highly controversial. Therefore, the author should strengthen their claims by showing
how their results change when different sets of estimates are considered. For this purpose, I
recommend also considering
- O*NET Degree of Automation scores, and
- automation estimates from the Arntz et al study (ref. [5] in the article).
(4) Although workers care about their jobs and policy makers care about employment numbers,
work from Autor, Acemoglu, and others all suggest that occupations are best understood as
abstract bundles of tasks and skills because technology interacts with labor by impacting the
demand for specific tasks and skills. Therefore, does an occupation's susceptibility to automation
impact the occupation's skill similarity to other occupations? In turn, does this fundamentally
change the job network?
Work from James Bessen (BU) and, alternatively, from David Deming (Harvard) demonstrate
that occupations that are exposed to automation can redefine their skill requirements to reflect
changing labor demands. Often, these transitions focus on an increased reliance on social skills.
Therefore, exposure to automating technology does not always reduce employment. As an
example from Bessen's work, the increased adoption of ATMs corresponded to national increase
in employment for bank tellers in the US--perhaps a counter-intuitive result--because ATMs
made it cheaper to open bank branches (i.e., demand elasticity) and bank tellers began to replace
clerical skills with social skills. So, since this occupational skill redefinition has been shown to
3
occur with exposure to automating technology, how does the author incorporate these insights
into our understanding of the job network in the study?
(5) If the skill similarity scores that define the edge weights in the job network do indeed
correspond to worker transitions between occupations, then which skills promote career mobility
for workers? Are these the skills that are susceptible to automation (this may be difficult to
answer convincingly)? More practically, this type of insight would be helpful to policy makers
attempting to promote career mobility for workers through informed worker retraining
programs. This level of insight should significantly strengthen the impact of this study.
Minor comments:
- the "locally greedy" clustering algorithm employed in this study is often referred to as "Louvain
community detection" in my experience
- Figure 2 is very helpful for clarifying the measures.
- on page 8, it is not clear to me what variable t is referring to. Is it the same t that is defined on
page 9?
- Table 2 represents an excellent level of insight (of course, I have my concerns listed above). This
is a level of detail that policy makers should find very helpful.

The study investigates the effects of automation on labor force and creates a network of jobs by
their skills similarities. The identification of automation is based on the classification and the
network results show distinct patterns of automation by different job sectors. In addition, the
study introduces metrics for measuring job mobility. Finally, it offers a solution formula to

pect to future automatability, I analyzed the links between individual skills and the F&O

current automation and (2) low estimates of future automatability. Skills that showed this pattern
be plausibly interpreted as skills that have become important within jobs that have already faced
els of computerization and have adapted their tasks such that they are no longer susceptible to
utomation. Skills highlighted in this analyses, therefore, may be candidates for retraining within

a value commonly used for networks between 100 and 1000 nodes.
on to adding more detail on this procedure (see page 3, lines 70-84), I have also added a
h to the results describing the relationship between these network-based sectors and the CPS-
occupation groups (page 7, lines 211-218). Additionally, I have added a supplemental figure

great point, and indeed it is the result of several of Frey & Osbornes categories being
ated into what I refer to as the business sector. The paragraph (page 7, lines 211-218) and
ental figure (Figure S2) referenced in the previous response illustrate this in more detail.

eciate the reviewer pointing this out. The previous phrasing that positive values represented
was incorrect. We have adjusted the description of this measure to reflect that it is bounded
0 and 1, thus all nodes will necessarily have a positive value (see page 4, line 97)

While I agree that there is quite a bit of overlap between the values for the business/industrial

ugh it is subtle, I think the figure does demonstrate that values tend to be lower in those sectors
thers (perhaps more-so now with the addition of the boxplots).
nt 9: Could the bi-modality of business affect the inter-sector connectivity?
very interesting question. The bimodality of automatability within the business sector would not
irect effect on the connections of business jobs to jobs in other sectors. However, the fact that the
sector is made up of a more diverse set of jobs (according to the CPS classification groups; see
2) may be related to its low inter-sector connectivity. Yet the service sector also contains a
f CPS classifications and has relatively high inter-sector connectivity, so it is unclear to what
is could drive the observed results.
