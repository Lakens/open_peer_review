This manuscript reports an interesting study that investigated the effects of different kinds of
background music (happy vs. violent) on a binocular rivalry task (with neutral vs. violent
images), and how these effects might depend on the participants’ music preferences/long-term
music exposure. Overall, I find the study well designed and written, and my only real concern is
related to familiarity and it’s potential role in some of the observed effects. With familiarity I
mean both veridical familiarity with the specific violent and happy pieces used in the experiment,
as well as stylistic familiarity with the respective musical genres. It is likely that the fans and non-
fans of violent music differed in terms of both veridical and stylistic familiarity with the music
pieces/genres used in the experiment. Was familiarity measured at all? Familiarity is known to
increase liking for music (see e.g., North & Hargreaves, 1995; Peretz et al., 1998), and thus the
differences in the valence ratings of the fans and non-fans of violent music might reflect
differences in familiarity rather than differential emotional processing of the music. This
possibility should be taken into consideration and discussed, and some of the conclusions (e.g.,
that “fans of violent music are desensitized to the aggressive and violent themes within this
music”, p. 10, rows 51-52) adjusted accordingly.
Some minor points:
- Page 5, description of procedure (rows 46-49): “each violent-neutral pair was presented twice,
where the violent was present to the left eye in one trial and to the right eye in the repeated trial.”
Were these orders randomized or counterbalanced somehow? Or were all violent images always
presented to the left eye first? Please clarify.
- Reporting effect sizes in the ANOVA analyses: I would advice you to report generalized eta
squared (see Bakeman, 2005) instead of partial eta squared, since it provides comparability across
between-subjects and within-subjects effects.
- Page 8, rows 27-19: The F-statistics and effect sizes are identical for the main effect of Group
and for the interaction effect of Group & Music. Is this a typo?

This paper is based on an interesting study but there are far too many assumptions and bias
involved that invalidates the results. It is assumed that certain songs are inherently violent or
happy and it is not discussed how these assumptions were arrived at. Social and cultural
influences and personal experiences on how meaning is attached to musical phenomenon are
ignored. Music has no inherent meaning and meaning of any particular recording often changes
over time depending on memories, emotions and beliefs associated with the music, the context
and other socio-cultural factors. In addition, it is not clear how violence and happiness was
defined here: was it the music or the lyrics? Or both? Unclear.
More specifically:
P2 L21-2: The abstract mentions that it was suggested that violent media influences levels of
violent behaviour, but there are no references to demonstrate this. The authors have not defined
what they mean by happy and violent music nor how they came to these definitions. They have
ignored their own cultural bias when determining this.
P2 L28-52: It is reductionist to claim that all death and heavy metal lyrics are violent. It is also
reductionist to claim that heavy metal and death metal are the same in terms of sonic world and
lyrical content. The correlational studies mentioned have not demonstrated any direct
relationship between the music and the behaviour for the same reason that the cultural and social
influences were not investigated.
P4 L35-40: The song choices are arbitrary and the definitions of the groups (fans and non-fans)
poorly defined. Who has the power to make these decisions? How has researcher-bias influenced
these decisions? What were the musical histories of the participants and how has that influenced
their musical choices? Do fans of 'violent' music feel 'happy' when they listen to it? If so, then that
is their happy music. Emotions are attached to music through experience, they are not inherent.
Also, tools such as the MIRtoolbox do not enable any understanding of how meaning is attached
to auditory experiences. In other words, breaking down the mechanics of a piece of music in this
way ignores how social and cultural processes inform emotions, memories and beliefs about
music and the results are unlikely to yield anything of use.
P11 L38-45: The authors imply that there is an object known as happy music that when applied to
people who focus on violence, will distract them away from such violence. No musical experience
4
has a causal effect that can be measured and predicted in this way, since the meaning attached to
the experience is largely formed through emotions, memories and beliefs about the musical
phenomenon, the current situation and any situations associated with the music in the past.
In general, it is very vague what exactly the researchers are discussing. They say they found
similar physical elements of sound in the two song examples yet they discuss violent themes,
which indicates that they are discussing lyrics, and nothing really to do with the sound at all.
Without understanding what musical experiences, including and not-including music, means to
groups and how those meanings were established, then the exposure of any particular music at a
particular time in a particular context will not be able to determine why the results occurred. In
other words, without a sociological grounding this form of research on musical impact is deeply
flawed.
Some further general comments:
- There is a focus on death metal, yet the authors refer to violence in hip hop lyrics in their
references, but this is not explored at all in the article.
- The heavy metal papers referenced are mostly from the 1990s and refer to music in the 1980s
when the dominant narrative linked such music to deviant behaviour. These studies do not
consider socio-cultural influences on behaviour and the resultant association to musical
phenomenon either.
- This paper also does not consider examples where music might be experienced as happy but the
lyrics are violent in nature, or vice versa. For example:
Examples:
“Ding dong the witch is dead” Wizard of Oz. Violent lyrics, jaunty music, happy imagery.
Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines” and rape. Popular song in the style of Pharrel Williams.
Sufjan Stevens “John Wayne Gacy Jr” about a serial killer, very calm and relaxed style of music.
Plenty of metal songs with positive lyrics as well, even if they do tend to focus on the darker
more melancholic side of human experience, but without that there would be no validity amongst
the group membership who values the sharing of those experiences.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Peter Keller):
Two experts have reviewed your manuscript and both found the study to be interesting.
However, Reviewer 1 raised concerns about the issue of familiarity with the musical materials
and recommended minor revisions to address this issue. Reviewer 2 has serious reservations
about the validity of the research with respect to issues related to musical meaning and the
definition of key constructs such as violence and happiness. Major revision aimed at clarifying
relevant assumptions would be needed to address this reviewer’s concerns.

This manuscript reports an interesting study that investigated the effects of
different kinds of background music (happy vs. violent) on a binocular rivalry
task (with neutral vs. violent images), and how these effects might depend
on the participants’ music preferences/long-term music exposure. Overall, I
find the study well designed and written, and my only real concern is related
to familiarity and its potential role in some of the observed effects. With
familiarity I mean both veridical familiarity with the specific violent and
happy pieces used in the experiment, as well as stylistic familiarity with the
respective musical genres. It is likely that the fans and non-fans of violent
music differed in terms of both veridical and stylistic familiarity with the
music pieces/genres used in the experiment. Was familiarity measured at all?
Familiarity is known to increase liking for music (see e.g., North &
Hargreaves, 1995; Peretz et al., 1998), and thus the differences in the valence
ratings of the fans and non-fans of violent music might reflect differences in
familiarity rather than differential emotional processing of the music. This
possibility should be taken into consideration and discussed, and some of the
conclusions (e.g., that “fans of violent music are desensitized to the
aggressive and violent themes within this music”, p. 10, rows 51-52) adjusted
accordingly.
We thank the reviewer for the comment. We have acknowledged this
possibility in the discussion section as “This high exposure, in turn, leads to
increased familiarity that further contributes to enjoyment [78, 79]. Thus,
fans and non-fans differed from each other not only in their emotional
responses to the song Eaten, but also in their level of enjoyment and exposure
to this genre of music, and their familiarity with it.” (See Page 5 Line 60 and
Page 6 Line 1-3.)
We’ve also modified the conclusion accordingly as “High valence ratings
suggest that fans derived positive emotional experiences from the music,
which were likely reinforced by high levels of exposure and familiarity to the
music.” (See Page 6 Line 32-33.)
Some minor points:
- Page 5, description of procedure (rows 46-49): “each violent-neutral pair
was presented twice, where the violent was present to the left eye in one
trial and to the right eye in the repeated trial.” Were these orders
randomized or counterbalanced somehow? Or were all violent images always
presented to the left eye first? Please clarify.
These orders were randomized. This has been clarified in Line 53-54 on Page 3
as “each violent-neutral pair was presented twice at random positions in the
sequence of trials, where the violent was present to the left (right) eye in one
trial and to the right (left) eye in the repeated trial.”
- Reporting effect sizes in the ANOVA analyses: I would advise you to report
generalized eta squared (see Bakeman, 2005) instead of partial eta squared,
since it provides comparability across between-subjects and within-subjects
effects.
Thanks for the suggestion. Generalized eta squared has been reported
instead of partial eta squared across the whole article.
- Page 8, rows 27-19: The F-statistics and effect sizes are identical for the
main effect of Group and for the interaction effect of Group & Music. Is this a
typo?
Thanks for pointing out this. It is a typo. This has been corrected in the text.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper is based on an interesting study but there are far too many
assumptions and bias involved that invalidates the results. It is assumed that
certain songs are inherently violent or happy and it is not discussed how
these assumptions were arrived at. Social and cultural influences and
personal experiences on how meaning is attached to musical phenomenon
are ignored. Music has no inherent meaning and meaning of any particular
recording often changes over time depending on memories, emotions and
beliefs associated with the music, the context and other socio-cultural
factors. In addition, it is not clear how violence and happiness was defined
here: was it the music or the lyrics? Or both? Unclear.
We thank the reviewer for these comments. We are sympathetic to the points
raised and have not made these assumptions, so infer that the manuscript
needs clarification. We’ve addressed these points in three ways. First, we
clarify the aim of our study, which was to examine implicit processing of
violent imagery among self-declared fans and non-fans of music with violent
themes. Our findings confirm what the reviewer asserts: that fans and non-
fans derive different experiences from music, leading to differential effects of
music on how violent images are processed. Second, we label songs by their
titles, rather than as “violent music” or “happy music”. Third, we clarify our
use of the term violence, and adopt widely accepted criteria in the aggression
and violence literature, and apply the terms to both the lyrics and music. For
lyrics, depictions of violence in our song “Eaten” are unambiguous according
to the World Health Organization definition. For non-lyrical qualities of music,
we draw from two sources of evidence: 1) that emotion is expressed in music
using the same “code” as that used in the human voice, which expresses
emotionality effectively and unambiguously using prosodic signals that are
readily decoded by listeners; 2) we reference the ethology literature on
biological signals of aggression (e.g., growls, screams) and cite evidence that
the acoustic qualities of “Eaten” (e.g., non-linearities, rapid pace) are
congruent with aggressive sounds in nature. Please refer to Page 2 Line 28-
34.
We take on board the reviewer’s point that the emotional connotation of
musical sounds is not rigid, and we are careful not to imply otherwise. To
ensure no reader has the same concerns, we inserted a paragraph in the
introduction that distinguishes between the complex way individuals derive
meaning from a particular activity, and violence as a societal and legal
concept (refer to Page 2 Line 20-27). For example, fans of the game “Grand
Theft Auto” typically experience joy and empowerment from the game; but
society still considers murder – depicted repeatedly in the game – as an act of
violence.
The current investigation addressed a very simple and fundamental question:
Do fans of music with violent themes become desensitized to violence
depicted visually? They do not. This finding will be surprising to many media-
violence researchers, parent groups, and government policy makers, and yet
it underscores exactly what the reviewer highlighted about the complex
nature of musical meaning and experience.
More specifically:
P2 L21-2: The abstract mentions that it was suggested that violent media
influences levels of violent behaviour, but there are no references to
demonstrate this. The authors have not defined what they mean by happy
and violent music nor how they came to these definitions. They have ignored
their own cultural bias when determining this.
Response: The journal does not permit the use of references in the abstract.
References demonstrating this point were amply cited in the introduction –
see the first paragraph of the introduction.
The music used in the present experiment have been more clearly defined in
the abstract. See Page 1 Line 33-34 as “…… while they heard Western popular
music with lyrics that expressed happiness or Western extreme-metal music
with lyrics that expressed violence.”
P2 L28-52: It is reductionist to claim that all death and heavy metal lyrics are
violent. It is also reductionist to claim that heavy metal and death metal are
the same in terms of sonic world and lyrical content. The correlational
studies mentioned have not demonstrated any direct relationship between
the music and the behaviour for the same reason that the cultural and social
influences were not investigated.
Thanks for this comment. We agree not all metal lyrics are violent. We never
made this claim and nor would we. Our research concerns people who are
self-reported fans and frequent listeners of “violent music” which we defined
clearly to participants. Therefore, it isn’t relevant that not all Death Metal
music is violent, but we are now careful to make this point clear. We don’t
want to overstate this point, because our research has determined that a
high proportion of death metal music does contain violent lyrics (as defined
by the World Health Organization), but we now state explicitly in the text that
not all death and heavy metal music contains violent lyrics as “Some genres
of music, including but not limited to extreme metal, rap, and hip hop, are
often, though certainly not always, characterised by aggressive sounds and
violent lyrics.” (see Page 1 Line 51-52)
The reviewer makes a good point that our use of a forward slash between
“heavy” and “death” could imply that these two categories are the same in
terms of music and lyrical content. Thus, all instances of “death/heavy metal”
have been changed to “death metal and heavy metal” across the article.
P4 L35-40: The song choices are arbitrary and the definitions of the groups
(fans and non-fans) poorly defined. Who has the power to make these
decisions? How has researcher-bias influenced these decisions? What were
the musical histories of the participants and how has that influenced their
musical choices? Do fans of 'violent' music feel 'happy' when they listen to it?
If so, then that is their happy music. Emotions are attached to music through
experience, they are not inherent.
We’ve provided a clearer justification for our song choices and additional
details about participants in the two groups. We also make a clearer
distinction between expressed and felt emotion. Please refer to Page 2 Line
20-50.
On the point that the songs are “arbitrary”, we disagree. We adopted
predetermined criteria for selecting songs that were contrasting in their
connotations. The song “Eaten” unambiguously depicts violence in the lyrics,
and its sonic features express aggression according to ethological principles
of biological signalling. In contrast, the song “Happy” depicts prosocial lyrics
and has a conventional song structure written in a major key. It is true that
other songs might have fulfilled these criteria, but methodological
considerations limited the number of songs we could examine.
With respect to the reviewer’s question “Do fans of violent music feel happy
when they listen to it?” – we are now clearer that our criteria for song choice
did not include the emotional experience of participants while listening to the
music (felt emotion), but was determined by the expression of violence and
aggression in music (expressed emotion). Expression of violence and
aggression was determined in two ways. First, violence was explicitly
expressed in lyrics while the music contained features associated with
aggressive biological signals. Second, metal fans in our study explicitly
indicated that they frequently listened to and enjoyed metal music “with
violent themes”. Thus, we described the song “Eaten” as an instance of
violent music based on its literal content, past empirical findings, ethological
principles of biological signals, and how fans themselves construed this music.
The reviewer correctly notes that fans have positive “felt” experiences to this
music. We agree: our valence ratings confirm this insight, as does our
previous research on Death Metal music, which we cite in the manuscript.
Also, tools such as the MIRtoolbox do not enable any understanding of how
meaning is attached to auditory experiences. In other words, breaking down
the mechanics of a piece of music in this way ignores how social and cultural
processes inform emotions, memories and beliefs about music and the
results are unlikely to yield anything of use.
We address this comment in three ways. First, we clarify the aim of our
research. Our aim was simple, and relevant to widespread concerns about the
long-term effects of listening to music with violent themes: To determine how
violent imagery is implicitly processed by individuals who frequently listen to
and enjoy music with violent themes. Second, we now acknowledge in our
discussion section that social and cultural processes “inform emotions,
memories and beliefs about music” (see Page 6 Line 15-16). We never
disagreed with this point, and indeed it helps to explain the differences that
we observed in how music impacts upon implicit processing of violent
imagery by fans and non-fans. Third, we clarify our reason for using the
MIRtoolbox as to control the arousal of the songs arising from loudness and
tempo, in order to reduce the potential impact of physiological arousal on
binocular rivalry processing. It wasn’t used to investigate social and cultural
processes – it’s simply a convenient and powerful way to measure and modify
some acoustic features of music stimuli.
P11 L38-45: The authors imply that there is an object known as happy music
that when applied to people who focus on violence, will distract them away
from such violence. No musical experience has a causal effect that can be
measured and predicted in this way, since the meaning attached to the
experience is largely formed through emotions, memories and beliefs about
the musical phenomenon, the current situation and any situations associated
with the music in the past.
As we compared implicit violent imagery processing under experimental and
comparison conditions, we can indeed infer that exposure to different types
of music “caused” the pattern of effects observed for the non-fan group
relative to the fan group. However, we acknowledge there are different
interpretations of the effect. Please refer to Page 6 Line 4-14.
In general, it is very vague what exactly the researchers are discussing. They
say they found similar physical elements of sound in the two song examples
yet they discuss violent themes, which indicates that they are discussing
lyrics, and nothing really to do with the sound at all. Without understanding
what musical experiences, including and not-including music, means to
groups and how those meanings were established, then the exposure of any
particular music at a particular time in a particular context will not be able to
determine why the results occurred. In other words, without a sociological
grounding this form of research on musical impact is deeply flawed.
We thank the reviewer for picking up on this potential source of confusion,
and we have reworded our descriptions accordingly. Briefly, we equated the
two songs on overall loudness (intensity) and tempo, but not on other
attributes. The songs are clearly very different in virtually all other respects,
and we have described these differences in detail. Please see Page 3 Line 15-
22.
We cannot determine the impact of musical sound versus the lyrics as we
define the expressed emotion of music based on both musical sound and
lyrics. Please refer to Page 2 Line 20-34, which states the definition of violent
and happy music used in this study.
We have also labelled the two songs used in the experiment according to
their names – “Eaten” and “Happy” rather than “violent music” and “happy
music” throughout the article.
Again, our aim was to determine how violent images are implicitly processed
by individuals who explicitly claim to enjoy music with violent themes. It was
not to determine the impact of individual experience and socio-cultural
factors or how the musical meanings were established.
Some further general comments:
- There is a focus on death metal, yet the authors refer to violence in hip hop
lyrics in their references, but this is not explored at all in the article.
Although we tested fans of death metal or heavy metal music and the stimuli
used in the experiment is also a death metal song, our focus is the violence in
this kind of music rather the music genres per se. Therefore, we also included
references to research on violence in non-metal music (including hip hop).
- The heavy metal papers referenced are mostly from the 1990s and refer to
music in the 1980s when the dominant narrative linked such music to deviant
behaviour. These studies do not consider socio-cultural influences on
behaviour and the resultant association to musical phenomenon either.
We have 18 references to research that explicitly considers heavy or death
metal, including four new references that we added in response to this
comment. Most are recent and only 6 were published prior to 2001.

- This paper also does not consider examples where music might be
experienced as happy but the lyrics are violent in nature, or vice versa. For
example:
Examples:
“Ding dong the witch is dead” Wizard of Oz. Violent lyrics, jaunty music,
happy imagery.
Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines” and rape. Popular song in the style of Pharrel
Williams.
Sufjan Stevens “John Wayne Gacy Jr” about a serial killer, very calm and
relaxed style of music.
Plenty of metal songs with positive lyrics as well, even if they do tend to
focus on the darker more melancholic side of human experience, but without
that there would be no validity amongst the group membership who values
the sharing of those experiences.

Or stories from literature
- Rime of the Ancient Mariner – Iron Maiden
Or science ficton
- Voivod – Lost Machine
We now note that future research may examine music with contrasting
emotional connotations in the lyrics and music. Please refer to Page 6 Line
15-23.
We are well aware of the literature on the interaction between lyrics and
song, and past research from our lab has made considerable progress in
understanding how the many dimensions of music combine and interact in
their psychological and cognitive-motor effects. Addressing such interactions
was not our aim. Instead, our goal was to address fundamental questions
that concern parents, the music industry, politicians, and government
censorship policies: whether fans of metal music with explicitly violent lyrics
are desensitised to violence, and whether listening to aggressive music
influences implicit processing of violent imagery. We believe our results will
have a significant impact on theory and research.
We acknowledge there are issues not addressed in our study, but no study in
the psychology of music can be expected to consider every possible issue.
