The evaluated paper, written by Sheng Zeng and co-authors, deals with the results of the
uranium rock leaching with sulfuric acid. The paper presents a set of many mathematical models
describing the process of leaching uranium from uranium ores by sulfuric acid. The thing is, these
models do not even describe the uranium leaching mechanism, only process/procesesses. Why
use the concept of a fractal dimension to describe the leaching process? If it does not explain the
dissolution mechanism of uranium-containing minerals? It is clear that the amount of leached
uranium increases with the degree of rock fragmentation.

Besides, even if the authors wanted to describe the mechanism of dissolution, there is the lack
information on the form in which uranium occurs in the rock investigated. The mineral
composition of the studied rocks should be presented and it should be shown which minerals,
occur in the rock, contain uranium. For this purpose, analyses using an electron microprobe
should be performed. Therefore, equations (4) and (5) are unfounded, because they do not take
into account the original form of uranium occurrence. The authors presented only the results of
the analysis of the chemical composition of the rock. On its basis, they assessed what phases are
present in the rock. They argue that there are silicates, that’s right. But how do you know that
carbonates are present? CO2 content or loss on ignition (LOI) were not determined. In addition,
the sum of presented chemical components equals 89.15%. What about missing 10.75%?
In some items in the literature list, the volume or page numbers are missing.

Detail Response to Reviewers
Reviewer: 1
Comments:
Q1: In Fig.6 and Fig.7, the maximum values of metal dissolution rate by using
chemical kinetic equations and diffusion kinetic equations are different, what is
the mechanism of this difference?
Reply:
We appreciate you very much for the valuable comments. The data in
Fig.6 and Fig.7 are derived from the linear segment slope of the curve in
Fig.3 and Fig.4 by using equation 17 and equation 18, respectively. Different
values of metal dissolution rate are obtained from two kinetic equations,
and it can be concluded that the early stage of leaching uranium was
controlled by chemical reaction and later stage was controlled by diffusion
reaction from Fig.8. (Please see lines #231-239, 304-314)
Q2: Why does the slope of the curve with fractal dimension less than 2 change
slowly and greater than 2 is basically unchanged after 15 days?
Reply:
Thanks for your valuable comments. When the fractal dimension less
than 2.0, the large particles ores account for a large proportion, and the
smaller particles ores can move down through the gap in the sample,
resulting in the majority of large particles stay in the upper part of the
sample. Then, the porosity and the permeability of the sample both become
higher as well as the flow rate of the leaching solution in the upper position,
causing a shorter reaction time of the leaching. In addition, the percolation
pathway and the dominant flow may be formed due to the high porosity of
the sample and high flow rate of the leaching solution, and the dead angle
may be generated where the leaching solution cannot reach. Meanwhile,
some smaller particles ores drove by the liquid may further migrate to the
lower position, then the area of the dead angle may increase and the
permeability may decrease in the lower position as certain particles ores
may block the passage of the liquid. Thus, the slope of the curve with fractal
dimension less than 2.0 change slowly with the time passing. As for the
sample with fractal dimension greater than 2.0, the sample has relatively
uniform particle ores and the leaching solution has less dead angle and
stable flow rate, leading to the steady slope of the curve with fractal
dimension greater than 2.0 after 15 days. (Please see lines #277-290)
Q3: It is not well described why the leaching time would be greatly shortened
and the leaching rate would increase with sooner chemical-diffusion coupling
phase, a deep analysis about the mechanism of this phenomenon would be
helpful.
Reply:
Thanks for your valuable suggestions. A deep analysis about the
mechanism of the phenomenon have been added in the revised manuscript.
(Please see lines #329-338)
Q4: Several grammatical and spelling errors are found in the paper. Thorough
grammar and spell checking is needed.
Reply:
Through re-reading the full paper carefully, all of the grammatical and
spelling errors have been revised in the revised manuscript.
Finally, we appreciate your constructive suggestions and pertinent
comments, which are of importance to improve the quality of our
manuscript. Thank you very much!

Comments:
Q1: Why use the concept of a fractal dimension to describe the leaching
process?
Reply:
We appreciate you very much for the valuable comments. Fractal
theory is one of the non-liner mathematic methods and has been used
extensively to describe irregular and fragmented objects with no
characteristics length. In our study, the crushed ores have different particle
sizes composition and irregular geometry, which have great influence on the
leaching process. Moreover, the crushed ores can be described by the fractal
theory easily. Thus, the fractal dimension was used to describe the leaching
process in our study. (Please see lines #92-94)
Q2: If it does not explain the dissolution mechanism of uranium-containing
minerals? It is clear that the amount of leached uranium increases with the
degree of rock fragmentation.
Reply:
Admittedly, the amount of leached uranium increases with the degree
of rock fragmentation. However, a column leaching experiment was adopted
in our study, we do not only consider the impact of degree of rock
fragmentation, but also need consider the influence of permeability of
crushed ores on the leaching efficiency and the amount of leached uranium
in the process of the leaching experiment. As shown in Table 3, the higher
degree of fragmentation is, the properties of crushed ores with lower
porosity and permeability may be generated. Therefore, a suitable degree of
rock fragmentation is of great importance in uranium leaching experiment.
(Please see lines #103-108)
Q3: Besides, even if the authors wanted to describe the mechanism of
dissolution, there is the lack information on the form in which uranium occurs in
the rock investigated. The mineral composition of the studied rocks should be
presented and it should be shown which minerals, occur in the rock, contain
uranium. For this purpose, analyses using an electron microprobe should be
performed. Therefore, equations (4) and (5) are unfounded, because they do not
take into account the original form of uranium occurrence. These models do not
even describe the uranium leaching mechanism, only process/procesesses. But
how do you know that carbonates are present?
Reply:
We are very sorry for our inappropriate expressions. It is obviously
that different forms of uranium in the ores have different mechanism of
dissolution in the leaching experiment. Actually, the content of tetravalent
uranium and hexavalent uranium in the ore were determined by a chemical
method and corrected in the revised manuscript. Besides, analyses about the
mechanism of uranium leaching have been added in section 3.1. (Please see
lines #152-193)
Q4: CO2 content or loss on ignition (LOI) were not determined. In addition, the
sum of presented chemical components equals 89.15%. What about missing
10.75%?
Reply:
Thanks for your valuable comments. The chemical composition of the
uranium ores were tested by the chemical reaction method in our study.
According to the geological data, the samples selected for the experiment are
granite-type uranium, and the content of carbonate is low. Thus, the content
of CO2 was not measured in the test. Due to the reactions in the process of
uranium leaching are mainly the redox reactions, several chemical
components that may have influence on the experiment were tested
selectively, causing the total contents of the chemical components are not
equals 100%. (Please see lines #78-83)
Q5: In some items in the literature list, the volume or page numbers are missing.
Reply:
Thanks for your valuable comments. The volume or page numbers in
the literature list have been complemented.
Finally, we appreciate your constructive suggestions and pertinent
comments, which are of importance to improve the quality of our
manuscript. Thank you very much!
