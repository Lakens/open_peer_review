sReview of the manuscript "Automatic Prediction of Tumour Malignancy in Breast Cancer with
Fractal Dimension" submitted to Royal Society Open Science by Alan Chan and Jack Tuszynski
Reviewer: Jean Clairambault, INRIA and UPMC, Paris
This article deals with a proposed method of characterisation of tissues as benign or malignant by
fractal analysis of 2D histological images. It firstly presents the box-counting, or Hausdorff,
dimension in a classical algorithmic manner. The illustration chosen (the Koch snowflake) it is
clearly relevant to their study, as it concerns a mathematical object that is the limit in the 2D space
of a 1D object, i.e., something that will necessarily have fractal dimension between 1 and 2. This
point of view is certainly relevant in the case of contours of domains, such as the coast of
Cornwall, or the border of a tumour (as studied, e.g., by Antonio Bru et al. in
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3495(03)74715-8 … note, interestingly, that their measurements
of fractal dimension could not be used to discriminate between tumoral and non tumoral tissues)
by the same box-counting algorithm used by the authors of the present manuscript. In all these
cases it assumes starting from a 1D structure.
In the present case, the authors start from points (pixels, that by definition represent points in 2D)
and apparently also design 1D structures ("edge detection") to calculate a box-counting
dimension. But what do these pixels represent and what edge detection consist of in their case?
How far are hematoxylin (basophilic) an eosin (eosinophilic) concentrations relevant to help
design 1D structures and give account of a tissue characterisation, from the point of view of its
possible malignancy? They are certainly relevant when analysed by trained pathologists, but in
the case of an automated analysis, this is less clear. There may exist hidden choices in the blind
algorithms of the software used; in this case, they should be made explicit in the manuscript.
The authors then vary the magnification of the images, from 40X to 400X, and conclude that high
resolution are not discriminant between benign and malignant images, whereas low resolution
images are. It is clear indeed that when the focus dives into very tiny details, higher level
structures are inevitably lost. What are these higher level structures is not stated, the authors only
writing that poor differentiation in cancer should explain such good discrimination scores
between benign and malignant tissues. I do not know what a support vector machine is, but
classical linear discriminant analysis between clouds of points, using Mahalanobis distance,
would certainly provide an automated discrimination algorithm without using "cutoff by hand"
to design a best discriminant value of fractal dimension. That discrimination between subtypes is
poor is not surprising, as it usually requires the eye of a trained pathologist, and scores relying on
measurements finer than the raw box-counting dimension seem necessary to achieve it.
Whatever the blackbox algorithms used in this automatic process may be, the discrimination
scores between benign and malignant tissues are impressive, and, as stated by the authors, this
method might be used by pathologists to increase consensus between them, and also to train
young pathologists. I would however require that visual examples of poorly vs. finely
differentiated cells in the tissues under study be presented to the reader to document such good
discrimination and give hints to what discrimination consists of. In the same way, the actual
values of the fractal dimension (visually, in average, approximately 1.7 for benign tissues vs. 1.3
for malignant tissues) are not even considered in the text. Of course, discrimination is the goal of
this article, but could the measured values be compared between them, on a sort of malignancy
scale, and could they be compared (visually) with the fractal dimensions of fractal mathematical

objects such as the Koch snowflake? In particular the Cesaro fractal (consult wikipedia), with box-
counting dimension approximately 1.78, is close to filling the area it outlines, which is certainly
not the case of the Koch snowflake, with dimension 1.26. These two examples are close by their
dimensions to the averages in the clouds presented on Fig. 3.
In summary, I recommend that this manuscript be accepted after minor adjunctions, that I would
like to see before final acceptance.

In this manuscript, the authors provide a method to classify tumors based on fractal dimension

potentially help pathologists to classify patients based on slides taken from cancer patients. Some
of my comments are the following:
1. The flow is missing in the introduction section. It is important to discuss the need to
computationally evaluate the pathological slides in detail to classify tumors as benign or
malignant?
2. The total number of images in Tables1, 2 does not match for benign tumors.
3. Tables are not referenced in the main manuscript.

classify binary responses (benign vs. malignant), if only one feature is used for the classification?
5. Does the algorithm account for the tumor stroma which forms a major component in the
tissue?
6. Can the classifier assign a classification label to the images as stroma-enriched or stroma-
poor?
7. How did the authors account for image artifacts (for instance, color batch effects)?
8. The authors mentioned that, “It is clear that with just fractal dimension as the sole
feature, the best hope for diagnostic application is through examination of 40X slides. A possible
4
explanation is that as one increases the magnification, it becomes more difficult to see higher-
level features of the cell that are often indicative of cancer, like poor cell differentiation.”
a. Is this because you have selected only one feature?
b. Since the F1 score is high, does this imply that there are no batch effects or effects from
the ECM in the tissue?
9. The authors mention that, “However, our study found the opposite relationship, that
higher values of fractal dimension tend to be associated with lower tumor malignancy.”
a. This implies that the tissue is close to normal state. Can you validate this by testing your
method on normal tissue image?
10. It would be nice to have figures on the classification for subtypes in benign and
malignant separately.
11. It is not clear on the limitations of the current methodology.
In conclusion, this is an interesting work and the manuscript is suitable for publication once the

Our reply: We have commented on some of these choices in the manuscript although we think

answer some of the questions related to the methodology used in pathological slide acquisition.

Whatever the blackbox algorithms used in this automatic process may be, the discrimination 
scores between benign and malignant tissues are impressive, and, as stated by the authors, this 
method might be used by pathologists to increase consensus between them, and also to train 
young pathologists. I would however require that visual examples of poorly vs. finely 
differentiated cells in the tissues under study be presented to the reader to document such good 
discrimination and give hints to what discrimination consists of. In the same way, the actual values 
of the fractal dimension (visually, in average, approximately 1.7 for benign tissues vs. 1.3 for 
malignant tissues) are not even considered in the text. Of course, discrimination is the goal of this 
article, but could the measured values be compared between them, on a sort of malignancy scale, 
and could they be compared (visually) with the fractal dimensions of fractal mathematical objects

not the case of the Koch snowflake, with dimension 1.26. These two examples are close by their 
dimensions to the averages in the clouds presented on Fig. 3. 
 
Our reply: We have mentioned other geometrical fractals as conceptual examples, including the 
Cesaro fractal. We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestions made. 
 
In summary, I recommend that this manuscript be accepted after minor adjunctions, that I would

Reviewer: 2 
 
In this manuscript, the authors provide a method to classify tumors based on fractal dimension 
extracted from pathological images. The authors address an interesting topic, which could 
potentially help pathologists to classify patients based on slides taken from cancer patients. Some 
of my comments are the following: 
1. The flow is missing in the introduction section. It is important to discuss the need to 
computationally evaluate the pathological slides in detail to classify tumors as benign or 
malignant? 
 
Our reply: We have improved the flow and added several sentences regarding the motivation for 
this work. 
 
2. The total number of images in Tables1, 2 does not match for benign tumors. 
 
Our reply: We have corrected several typos. 
 
3. Tables are not referenced in the main manuscript. 
 
Our reply: We have referenced the tables in the corrected manuscript. 
 
4. It is not clear as to why the authors chose SVM and not logistic regression model to classify 
binary responses (benign vs. malignant), if only one feature is used for the classification? 
 
Our reply: This is a valid comment, the use of SVM was somewhat arbitrary and also forward-­-
looking since in the future we anticipate to use this method in conjunction with more features in 
order to better discriminate between the various malignant and benign subtypes. 
 
5. Does the algorithm account for the tumor stroma which forms a major component in the 
tissue? 
 
Our reply: We have not included any specific characteristics intended to account for the tumor 
stroma at this time. Future refinements will hopefully be more detailed. 
 
6. Can the classifier assign a classification label to the images as stroma-­-enriched or stroma-­-
poor? 
 
Our reply: This is in principle possible but we have not pursued this aspect in the present paper. 
Again, this is a valid issue that we plan to address in a future publication. 
 
7. How did the authors account for image artifacts (for instance, color batch effects)? 
 
Our reply: Since all images came from a single source with a high quality and a high level of 
consistency, we have not found a need to correct for image artifacts. It was our objective to base 
our analysis on a well-­-curated and high quality data set. 
 
8. The authors mentioned that, “It is clear that with just fractal dimension as the sole feature, 
the best hope for diagnostic application is through examination of 40X slides. A possible 
explanation is that as one increases the magnification, it becomes more difficult to see higher-­-level 
features of the cell that are often indicative of cancer, like poor cell differentiation.” 
a. Is this because you have selected only one feature? 
Our reply: We believe so. We also commented on this aspect in our corrected manuscript. 
 
b. Since the F1 score is high, does this imply that there are no batch effects or effects from the 
ECM in the tissue? 
Our reply: This again what appears to be the case. In order to address some of these issues in 
greater detail one should examine image quality across different data bases. This merits a separate 
publication. 
 
9. The authors mention that, “However, our study found the opposite relationship, that higher 
values of fractal dimension tend to be associated with lower tumor malignancy.” 
a. This implies that the tissue is close to normal state. Can you validate this by testing your 
method on normal tissue image? 
Our reply: Unfortunately, there were no normal tissue slides contained in the data base we used 
in this study. This is a valid point that we’d like to investigate in a future study. 
 
10. It would be nice to have figures on the classification for subtypes in benign and malignant 
separately. 
Our reply: We have added a figure with 8 panels corresponding to the subtypes. We thank the 
reviewer for this valuable suggestion. 
 
11. It is not clear on the limitations of the current methodology. 
Our reply: We have added a paragraph discussing these limitations in the last section of the 
revised paper. 
 
In conclusion, this is an interesting work and the manuscript is suitable for publication once the 
authors address the aforementioned comments. 
 
Our reply: We thank the reviewer for the many useful suggestions. We hope our corrections 
properly address the issues we could possibly deal with at this time. Some aspects are beyond our 
control as they deal with the data base that was created without our input. 
Sincerely,
