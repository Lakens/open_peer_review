The work by Masauso Moses Phiri et al has been subjected on the immobilisation of glucose
oxidase onto gold nanostars to produce of AuNSs-Cys-GOx bioconjugate complex for increased
attachment affinity, Good dispersity and Greater sensitivity of it. I think this method is not a
facile method to immobilisation of glucose oxidase onto gold nanostars and this manuscript need
to major and minor revision with following details:
Majors:
page 3 lines 3-4:
-"The PVP-stabilised seedless AuNSs were synthesized by reducing the HAuCl4 with ascorbic
acid and AgNO3 added to control the growth of the branches based on the method reported by
Phiri et al." The detailes of synthesis method should be clarified.
Page 3:
- NMR section is very detailed and should be summerised
Page 3 lines 53-54
- "Comparison assays were done using AuNSs without any GOx, AuNSs with unattached GOx in
solution" what is difference between these two states?
- "The thiol moiety has been found to be a very effective site for interaction" how this with one S
atom of Cys?
- The text of "Stability of AuNSs-Cys-GOx bioconjugates" section needs the reference.
- Where are the activity results?
Scheme 1 is very ambiguous:
- Where is roles of sulfo-NHS and EDC in scheme 1.
- What is the role of EDC in the AuNSs-Cys-GOx synthesis?
- Why in the GOx structure there are 2 NH3+ groups?
- Why the arrow to belong from AuNS to sulfo-NHS?
- Where is the pvp in this scheme?
- Why the authors used the 2 linkers (NHS and EDC) in this work?
"The particle-size distribution was estimated by measuring the size of approximately 100
nanoparticles in different grid regions"
- How?
- Where is the figure including 100 NP and what was the software for this estimation?
- All of components in the TEM images should be recognized and assigned?
In Figure 1:
- the Roman numerals on the figure should be corrected.
- Zero point of the all spectra should be specified.

I do not understand:
- Spectrum (III) shows the peaks for the NHS-terminated GOx with sulfo-NHS in tandem with
EDC.
In figure2:
- No difference between UV of AuNS-pvp and AuNS-Cys.
Page 5 line 60:
- I do not understand "No broadening of the GOx-modified AuNSs was observed which implies
that the AuNSs maintained their structural integrity with good dispersity"

This work synthesized gold nanostars based on the method reported in the literature. A stable
AuNSs-Cys-GOx bioconjugate complex was obtained by modification with Cys and NHS-
terminated glucose oxidase. The authors need to clearly establish how the work presented here is
novel compared to the previous work. And some conclusive evidence is needed by addressing
the below concerns:
1. Why using gold star? As I understand in your work, the L-cysteine (Cys) plays a role on
binding glucose oxidase. Then why did authors use gold star? Just because of “The method is
simple and easy to replicate”? Did authors compare the enzyme response on normal gold
nanoparticles (not star-shaped) also?
Is the bare gold star bad for enzyme immobilization? If so, why?
If the stars nanostructures play an important role, then I will have a question: How about the
influence of the number of branches of stars on enzyme immobilization?
2. Please explain how to avoid nonspecific binding of the protein with the authors’ methods. And
which data show the sample reducing nonspecific binding of the protein?
3. I suggest the authors to show SEM images to check the aggregation of the samples, because
TEM images just showed a small range.
4. Except for NMR, it is necessary to run XPS characterization also to check the modification and
immobilization.

The purification of AuNSs-Cys-GOx bioconjugates is not clear. It should be taken care in the
revised paper.
Hydrogen bonding plays a vital role in between NH & CO groups present in GOx to Cys-
modified AuNSs nanoparticle. Hence, I author should include FTIR data and to confirm structure

Comments to the Author(s)
The work by Masauso Moses Phiri et al has been subjected on the
immobilisation of glucose oxidase onto gold nanostars to produce of AuNSs-
Cys-GOx bioconjugate complex for increased attachment affinity, Good
dispersity and Greater sensitivity of it. I think this method is not a facile method
to immobilisation of glucose oxidase onto gold nanostars and this manuscript
need to major and minor revision with following details:
Majors:
1. page 3 lines 3-4:
-"The PVP-stabilised seedless AuNSs were synthesized by reducing the
HAuCl4 with ascorbic acid and AgNO3 added to control the growth of the
branches based on the method reported by Phiri et al." The details of synthesis
method should be clarified.
Response:
This has been done and now the section reads as follows in the text:
A recently published method for the synthesis of seedless silver and ascorbic
acid assisted AuNSs by Phiri et al. (Phiri et al., 2019) was followed. Briefly, 10
mL of ddH2O was acidified with 10 µL of 1M HCl. Thereafter, 50 µL of 100 mM
ascorbic acid was added under mild stirring. 50 µL of 50 mM HAuCl4 was added
to the mixture. Shortly and rapidly (within 30 seconds), 50 µL of 10mM AgNO3
was added to the solution which resulted in a deep blue colour change within
a few seconds. Finally, 500 µL of 2.5 mM PVP to the mixture. The prepared
AuNSs were cleaned-up by centrifugation for 90 minutes at 3000g. The pellet
was then recovered and re-suspended in 2 mL of ddH20.
2. Page 3:
- NMR section is very detailed and should be summarized
Response:
The above-mentioned section has since been summarised and reads as
follows:
1H-NMR analyses of the samples in fabrication stages was done
according to the method by Venter et al (Venter et al., 2018). 600 µL of
samples were measured at 500MHz on a Bruker Avance III HD NMR
spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance inverse (TXI)
1H[15N,13C] probe head and x, y, z gradient coils. 1H spectra were
acquired as 128 transients in 32K data points with a spectral width of
12002 Hz. Fourier transformation and phase and base line correction
were done automatically. Software used for NMR processing was Bruker
Topspin (V3.5). Bruker AMIX (V3.9.14) was used for metabolite
identification (Ellinger et al., 2013).
3. Page 3 lines 53-54
- "Comparison assays were done using AuNSs without any GOx, AuNSs with
unattached GOx in solution" what is difference between these two states?
Response:
This section has been rewritten in order to clarify the difference between the
two states. The following is an extract from the section:
Three comparison assays were done to assess if the AuNSs-Cys-GOx
bioconjugation method offered any advantage in biosensing; 1) AuNSs only
without the addition of any GOx to it as assay controls. 2) AuNSs with 5
µL GOx added to the reaction solutions. 3) Lastly, AuNSs-Cys-GOx
bioconjugates in solution for both oxidation and detection of glucose.
4. - "The thiol moiety has been found to be a very effective site for interaction"
how this with one S atom of Cys?
Response:
Reference is made to the two following publications, listed below, that explain
this in greater detail. In brief: Zhao et al., performed a comprehensive analysis
of cysteine–gold cluster complexes. In contrast to the conventional
understanding of the covalent nature of the S–Au bond, using computational
methods, they present that the S–Au bond exhibits both covalent and donor–
acceptor characters. One stable isomer of Au3–CysS was specially designed to
demonstrate these two bonding components explicitly. They concluded that
generally, the bonding strength between gold clusters and cysteine is positively
correlated with the S–Au overlap-weighted bond order, but negatively
correlated with the S–Au bond length.

evolution in cysteine–gold cluster complexes. Physical Chemistry

G., Dékány, I. 2010 Functionalization of gold nanoparticles with amino
acid, ß-amyloid peptides and fragment. Colloids and Surfaces B:
Biointerfaces. 81, 235-241.
5. - The text of "Stability of AuNSs-Cys-GOx bioconjugates" section needs
the reference.
Response:
The section has been rewritten and citation included in the manuscript.
6. - Where are the activity results?
Response:
The heading on page 3 line 49 has been modified to “Glucose sensing using
AuNSs-Cys-GOx bioconjugates” so that it is not misleading to the reader what
exactly was done.
7. Scheme 1 is very ambiguous:
i. Where is roles of sulfo-NHS and EDC in scheme 1.
ii. What is the role of EDC in the AuNSs-Cys-GOx synthesis?
iii. Why in the GOx structure there are 2 NH3+ groups?
iv. Why the arrow to belong from AuNS to sulfo-NHS?
v. Where is the pvp in this scheme?
Response:
Scheme 1 shows a summarized version of the whole reaction after the removal
of excess PVP. The remaining PVP is functionalised to the surface of the
AuNSs and some is removed via ligand exchange with L-cysteine.
All the structures are all schematic illustrations of the plausible reactions. For
example, the 2 NH3+ groups on the enzymes are for illustrative purposes only,
and not an exact representation of the enzyme.
The roles of EDC in the scheme is to react with a carboxylate group to form an
active ester leaving group. The advantage of adding sulfo-NHS to EDC
reactions is to increase the solubility and stability of the active intermediate,
which ultimately reacts with the attacking amine. EDC/sulfo-NHS coupled
reactions are highly efficient and tend to increase the yield of conjugation
significantly over that obtainable solely with EDC.
The arrow from the L-cysteine-modified AuNSs crisscrossed with the one from
the sulfo-NHS activated intermediate illustrating the reaction of the active ester
being mixed with amine-containing AuNSs for conjugation. The two-step
process of first incubating the enzyme with EDC/sulfo-NHS allows the
formation of the active species only on the enzyme, thus gaining control over
the conjugation reaction.
8. Why the authors used the 2 linkers (NHS and EDC) in this work?
Response:
EDC reacts with a carboxylate group to form an active ester leaving group. The
advantage of adding sulfo-NHS to EDC reactions is to increase the solubility
and stability of the active intermediate, which ultimately reacts with the
attacking amine. EDC/sulfo-NHS coupled reactions are highly efficient and
tend to increase the yield of conjugation significantly over that obtainable solely
with EDC (Hermanson, 2013).
9. "The particle-size distribution was estimated by measuring the size of
approximately 100 nanoparticles in different grid regions"
- How?
- Where is the figure including 100 NP and what was the software for this
estimation?
- All of components in the TEM images should be recognized and assigned?
Response:
In the revised manuscript, the authors have removed this part from the
methodology so as to narrow down to the main focus of the study – the
immobilisation of enzymes onto the nanoparticles.
10. In Figure 1:
- the Roman numerals on the figure should be corrected.
Response:
This has since been corrected.
- Zero point of the all spectra should be specified.
Response:
Only spectral regions of differentiation between L-Cysteine, Cysteine-modified
AuNSs, NHS-terminated glucose oxidase, and AuNSs-Cys-GOx
bioconjugates is shown. This is in accordance with the accepted norm of
reported NMR data.
11. I do not understand:
- Spectrum (III) shows the peaks for the NHS-terminated GOx with sulfo-NHS
in tandem with EDC.
Response:
The sentence has been modified to read as: “Spectrum (III) shows the peaks
for the NHS-terminated GOx.”
12. In figure2:
- No difference between UV of AuNS-pvp and AuNS-Cys.
Response:
There was a slight red-shift from 712 nm to 716 nm after the addition of 10–6 M
L-cysteine. Using both the NMR and UV-vis spectroscopy characterisation, a
good confirmation can be stated this shift is likely from the absorption of L-
cysteine molecules on gold nanostars surface.
13. Page 5 line 60:
- I do not understand "No broadening of the GOx-modified AuNSs was
observed which implies that the AuNSs maintained their structural integrity with
good dispersity"
Response:
The sentence has been corrected and now reads as: “No broadening of the
LPSR spectra for GOx-modified AuNSs was observed which implies that the
AuNSs maintained their structural integrity with good dispersity.”
14. I do not understand:
- "How the Au nanostars formation was confirmed?"
Response:
The UV-vis spectra of the synthesized AuNSs were observed to have typical
LSPRs of star-shaped nanoparticles as judged by the longer wavelengths and
the broad peaks. Increased aspect ratios of the branches make the longitudinal
components of the plasmon band become more intense and red-shifted
relative to the LSPR of spherical particles (Maiorano et al., 2011; Rodríguez-
Lorenzo et al., 2012). The TEM images showed the morphologies of the
nanocrystals to have star-shaped or multi-branched (as alternatively referred
to) (Maiorano et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013; Chirico et al., 2015; de Puig et al.,
2015).
- All the UV-Vis spectra 400-0 nm were scanned
Response:
This was corrected and now reads as follows: “All the UV-vis spectra scans
were from 400 – 990 nm.”
- The figure 4 should be assigned and appeared consequently which explained
in the text
Response:
The exact request here is however, not fully understood by us. The position of
the figure relative to the text has nonetheless been adjusted.
- Why the intensity for AuNSs-Cys-GOx is higher than the AuNSs intensity?
Response:
The UV-vis spectra in Figure 4 are not normalised. With the functionalisation
of the AuNSs with GOx there is an increase in the absorbance.
- What is the goal of ionic strength investigation in this work?
Response:
Literature requires that the functionalized nanoparticles are tested for stability
using a flocculation assay to investigate their ability to be used in biological
fluids (Wangoo et al., 2008). Application of functionalized nanostars in
biological samples requires them to be stable in solutions containing high
concentrations of proteins and salts (Wangoo et al., 2008). If the AuNSs are
not functionalized sufficiently, they are prone to aggregation in high ionic
strength solutions in which the van der Waals attraction is stronger than the
steric repulsion provided by the functionalization molecule (Wangoo et al.,
2008; Rodríguez-Lorenzo et al., 2012).
- What are the Gox, enzyme and protein roles in this work?
Response:
The GOx – which is both a protein and enzyme in this case, provides surface
functionalisation that offers stability to the gold nanoparticles – in our case,
gold nanostars (Wangoo et al., 2008).
- Generally, the absorbance of Au Nanoparticles have a max intensity before
600 nm wavelength but in this work this character has been appeared about
700 nm? Why?
Response:
AuNSs colloids display a wide and distinct LSPR feature, including an intense
band typically centred around 650–900 nm. Below are a few references in that

Comments to the Author(s)
This work synthesized gold nanostars based on the method reported in the
literature. A stable AuNSs-Cys-GOx bioconjugate complex was obtained by
modification with Cys and NHS-terminated glucose oxidase. The authors need
to clearly establish how the work presented here is novel compared to the
previous work. And some conclusive evidence is needed by addressing the
below concerns:
1. Why using gold star? As I understand in your work, the L-cysteine (Cys)
plays a role on binding glucose oxidase. Then why did authors use gold star?
Just because of “The method is simple and easy to replicate”? Did authors
compare the enzyme response on normal gold nanoparticles (not star-shaped)
also?
Is the bare gold star bad for enzyme immobilization? If so, why?
If the stars nanostructures play an important role, then I will have a question:
How about the influence of the number of branches of stars on enzyme
immobilization?
Response:
Gold nanostars were used mostly for two reasons; (i) signal transduction, and
(ii) larger surface area for enzyme immobilisation.
Signal transduction is based on the localised surface plasmon resonance
(LSPR) of the nanoparticles. The width, position, and number of LSPRs are
also determined by the shape of the Au NPs (Xia & Halas, 2005). A common
feature of LSPRs for nanostars is that they are located at lower energy
compared to the spheres. For example, Au nanospheres with the size of 2–50
nm show only one plasmon band centred at about 520 nm, while for nanostars
the plasmon band is redshifted and more intense (Amendola et al., 2017). The
combination of dielectric properties and chemical stability of nanostars make
them ideal substrates for the study of well-defined localized surface plasmon
resonances (LSPRs) within the visible and near-infrared spectral range
(Guerrero-Martínez et al., 2011). Gold nanostars are easier to tune in a
biochemical process for LSPR shifting either by their growth in size or change
in shape to more a spherical morphology.
Secondly, nanostars being made from Au, act as a very efficient support matrix
for enzyme immobilisation (Ahmad & Sardar, 2015). Nanostars are usually
larger in size than nanosheres thereby providing a larger surface areas for
enzyme immobilisation with potential for higher load of enzymes per
nanoparticle (Sapsford et al., 2013).
The bare star is not bad for functionalisation. The aim for the addition of
cysteine was help with attaining some of the ideal criteria for ideal
immobilisation such as having control over relative separation distance from
the nanostar; control over enzyme orientation by preventing the enzyme’s
active site from being covered if it absorbs on the surface of the nanostar;
enhance the attachment affinity of the enzyme to the nanostars. In short, the
aim was an attempt at finding optimal enzyme immobilisations strategies to our
synthesised gold nanostars.
The attachment approach that we used in this study was a covalent attachment
to the surface of L-cysteine-modified nanostars. In this case, we postulate that
the branches have no effect on the immobilisation process.
2. Please explain how to avoid nonspecific binding of the protein with the
authors’ methods. And which data show the sample reducing nonspecific
binding of the protein?
Response:
Experimentally, it has been reported that functionalisation of gold nanoparticles
with thiolated ligands leads to the formation of self-assembled monolayers of
thiols on the gold surfaces that has the potential to reduce nonspecific protein
absorption drastically (Lahiri et al., 1999). Thus, this study was building on such
literature studies that have leveraged this knowledge to functionalise proteins
in such a way as to reduce the potential for nonspecific absorption (Li et al.,
2007; Pandey et al., 2007; Bezbradica et al., 2014). For example, cysteine was
used together with glutaraldehyde to functionalise enzymes on an epoxy-
activated support. Mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) has is reported to have
been used to optimise enzyme immobilisation with thermal stability. It is
therefore expected that there was no unspecific protein absorption based on
the addition of cysteine that typically has the tendency to prevent it.
3. I suggest the authors to show SEM images to check the aggregation of the
samples, because TEM images just showed a small range.
Response:
SEM images were not taken at the time of imaging but TEM images with lower
magnifications covering a number of AuNSs were taken during microscopic
characterisation of the glucose oxidase – modified AuNSs. Such an image has
since been added as supplementary information.
4. Except for NMR, it is necessary to run XPS characterization also to check
the modification and immobilization.
Response:
Noted with thanks. Although this technique is currently unavailable to us, it
could in future be done in collaboration with others.

Comments to the Author(s)
The article reports on Facile immobilisation of glucose oxidase onto gold
nanostars with enhanced binding affinity and optimal function. It needs revision
before accepting for the publications.
The purification of AuNSs-Cys-GOx bioconjugates is not clear. It should be
taken care in the revised paper.
Response:
The section has been adjusted accordingly to include those details.
Hydrogen bonding plays a vital role in between NH & CO groups present in
GOx to Cys-modified AuNSs nanoparticle. Hence, I author should include FTIR
data and to confirm structure the following relevant below references can be
consider.
Polymer Engineering & Science 54 (1), 24-32, 2014.
Journal of applied polymer science 104 (1), 81-88, 2007.
Journal of applied polymer science 106 (1), 299-308, 2007.
Response:
FTIR technique was our method-of-choice but was unfortunately not available
to us at the time of characterisation. Hence, we resorted to using various
techniques such as the NMR, UV-vis spectroscopy, microscopy, and dynamic
light scattering (although the data was not included in the manuscript).
However, we shall try to include FTIR in our on-going work of functionalisation
of enzymes to nanoparticles.
The suggested references are well appreciated and appropriately referred to
in the manuscript.
English and grammatical errors should be rectified during the revision of the
paper.
This has also been dealt with accordingly.
